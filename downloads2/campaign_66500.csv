Apera KEEPER™ Gives Online Shoppers Peace Of Mind
PREVENT DELIVERED PACKAGES FROM BEING STOLEN, LOST OR DAMAGED
 
Online shopping is no longer a novelty but the norm. When you need something, you log into an e-commerce store, order it, and expect it at your front door within a day or two.
When a package goes missing or ends up destroyed, you feel bothered, frustrated, perturbed. We have all experienced this. Porch pirates are cashing in on the popularity of online shopping, and if you’re like us, you are starting to ask: are online deals worth the risk and hassle?  My packages were always going missing or ending up destroyed. It seemed like every other thing I ordered either got stolen or rained on, and I had had enough. If you have experienced it more than once, then you have probably tried to devise a solution to the problem. In one way or another, however, each of these solutions is flawed - inconvenience, unreliability, annoyance. I went looking for solutions, and it seemed like everyone had one to offer. “Use a security camera,” “require a signature on delivery,” “send the package to your office.” Inconvenient or unreliable, every solution I found seemed flawed in some way. That’s why my team and I developed KEEPER. KEEPER™ Is The DIY SolutionThat Is Convenient, Reliable, And Always Stress-freePUTS YOU BACK IN CONTROL AND SENDS THIEVES AWAY EMPTY HANDED    Too Good To Be True?

Maybe You can also create airbnb in the parcel world - parcelbnb (parcel box and bench).  Package theft brings awareness to the safety of express delivery.Porch pirates don't like spending so much time on a front porch as the GIF shows above, which tends to expose themselves to great risks. Instead, they would rather spend more time driving a car and looking for quick targets in the community.Shorr Packaging Corp. has conducted a series of questionnaires on the package theft and outlines the appearance of packages that are more likely to attract porch pirates. Shorr Packaging Corp. said: ""We also asked respondents what makes packages so appealing to porch pirates. Their top three answers: Location of the box after arriving (33 percent), branded packaging (31 percent) and descriptive text on the box (20 percent)."" What makes packages appealing to porch pirates?So we set out to find the most fundamental reasons for the package theft and did the research and development. We believe in the assumption: when a package is seen, it will be stolen. And KEEPER™ is positioned and focused on helping to hide the package. It must keep the package low-key hidden near the porch, lock and protect the package inside the package box, can be remotely opened and receive deliveries when not at home, and any action should give the user instant notification...In any case, we have succeeded, and the fluency of the operation far exceeded our goal! Awesome!  What We Need & What You Get

OK, so my packages are in the storage box, how is this going to stop someone from stealing both the box and my package?Most package thefts are a crime of opportunity, if the thief can't see the package they won't know it's there, as far as they are concerned your storage container is probably empty most of the time. In addition, the parcel will be stored in a common wooden box or ordinary bench storage container, without any locks and keyholes outside and cannot be opened by human power.For the more determined thieves, we strongly recommend bolting your storage container to your house and/or porch from inside the container so thieves can't access the bolts.How strong is KEEPER™? Can't it just be busted open or open with manpower?We understand your concern with the package box be opened by powerful guys. The majority of packages are a crime of opportunity and are stolen in the grab-and-dash way. That being said, if you see something suspicious, report it!KEEPER™'s rated locking force is 1400 lbs and passed the 4,400 lb. destructive test. This means that it is not easy to open by human power.4400 lbs. Destructive TestingBut have to say, we use 7 to 8pcs of SUS316 screws to fix the box and the front and rear brackets stabilizers. This involves the strength of the box itself, and we recommend a more sturdy storage container to enhance protection.This is going to add time to my delivery driver’s already busy schedule.

<b>

Here's the basic issue</b>:
</h2><b>Millions of Americans</b> own nice, modern homes.. but almost all of those homes have that basic, stamped-metal overhead garage door that's been the staple of the building industry for the past 30 years.  That's because until recently the only other option was to purchase a high-end, real wood garage door, which can cost up to $10,000.  So builders took the easiest and cheapest way out, and just ignored the garage door in the overall architectural planning of most homes, even very high-end ones.  That has resulted in millions of beautiful homes that are stuck with a boring, stamped metal overhead door.<br/><br/><b>And of course homeowners</b> aren't going to go to the time and expense of replacing a perfectly good garage door... so they just turned a blind eye to their boring garage doors, even though that garage door is frequently the largest single structure on the front of their homes... There's just been no cost-effective way to improve it.....<br/><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

</ul><br/><br/><h2>FAQ’s</h2>
<p><b>Are a bunch of magnets really going to hold these panels securely on my door?  </b>Short answer is ""yes.""  Long answer is that there is a huge difference between magnetic attachment (dynamic) and adhesive attachment (static.)  With static adhesion should the adhesive become brittle over time (most will) then a slight impact could dislodge the panel and it would fall off.  But with dynamic adhesion, there is a constant force (magnets never wear out) holding the panel to the metal door underneath.  Think of a hand constantly pushing the panels against the door all the time.  Even if there is a slight jarring or a high windstorm, there is a constant force fighting to keep the panels in place.  Plus should you need to repair them or want to completely change the look, a good tug will pull them off.<b><br/></b></p><p><b>I’m concerned that
since the panels aren’t permanently attached, they may be stolen.</b>  This is definitely a concern if you live in
an area that has a high theft rate. 
While a thief would have to know that these were GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b> panels and
not an actual garage door (not many thieves out there stealing garage doors) they
could theoretically take all 16 or 20 panels off your door and transport them
away.  A small dab of pure silicone
placed at each corner of  each panel  before installation would suffice to make it
difficult to just pop off an individual panel. 
However be aware that should you need to replace a panel or remove it,
there is a potential for damage to the GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b> panel, which would void the
warranty.  We have yet to have a report
of one of our systems being stolen.</p><p><b>I have a garage door opening that has an arched/beveled top.  Will a GarageSkins system still work?</b>  Yes!  However, the track will need to be recessed approximately 3/4"" back into the garage to provide the necessary clearance for the overlays to clear the edges of the bevel/arch.  By the time we launch we will have a national network of garage door professionals contracted to perform this task for you. <br/></p>
<p><b>Why aren’t GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b>
compatible with wooden garage doors?</b> 
Most wooden garage doors are manufactured to that specific opening that
they are intended for, and therefore aren’t a standard size.   <br/></p>
<p><b>I have a dent/ding in
my metal garage door.  Will the
GarageSkins system repair this?</b>  Only
in the case of the smallest dings in your garage door will the GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b>
system actually work.  This system was
designed to embellish a functional, multi-panel modern metal garage door, and
our strong magnets will force the panels to mold to the shape of your garage
door.  If there is no damage, the panels
will lay flat, but if there is a significant ding/dent, the Garageskins<b><i>™</i></b> system
will conform to that dent and will not mesh well with the other panels.  Best to have that individual panel replaced
before adding the GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b> system. 
Contact your local garage door provider for your best options.</p>
<p><b>I need to order a
couple of replacement panels</b>.  It
happens.  Junior has the car in drive
instead of reverse, and BAM, bumper meets garage door.  While there is some flexibility in our
panels, should they be damaged we can replace them individually.  Our modular system and standardized sizing
means we can manufacture a panel that matches both pattern and stain.  <br/></p>
<p><b>Is a GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b>
system paintable?</b>  No, however
products are being developed that will provide a paintable surface.  The original GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b> system were
developed to simulate the look of a high-end solid wood carriage house styled
door and all of our R and D has been around providing a beautiful wood
exterior.  We have been contacted many
times by people looking for a product like ours that is also paintable so those
systems are in development.  <br/></p>
<p><b>My garage door has a security handle in the center.</b>  Can I still install a GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b>
system?  Yes, but the outer portion of
the security handle will have to be removed. 
Typically these are held on with a small set screw in the side that will
release the handle.  If any portion of
the mechanism underneath sticks out from the front of the metal garage door, it
will also have to be removed.  There is
no way to anticipate the location of your security handle, so there is no way
for us to provide a through-hole during manufacturing.  Simply drilling a hole through your
GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b> system will void the warranty an expose your GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b> panel to
the possibility of water damage.</p>
<p><b>Can I custom order a
GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b> system?</b>  Our GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b>
systems are designed to fit the majority of garage doors installed in the past
30 years.  While there are some garage
doors that are of a different size or configuration, we are not yet large
enough to be able to accept custom orders. 
With our 4 initial patterns fitting most doors, and 4 more patterns in
development, we feel that there is a design that should be pleasing to almost
anyone looking to upgrade the appearance of their garage door.</p>
<p><b>I live in “Tornado
Alley.”  Will the GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b> system be
safe on my garage door?</b>  We have
tested our Garageskins<b><i>™</i></b> panels on a steel door up to an 80 mph wind and the
adhesion held fine. Please see our
Warranty as Acts of God are unpredictable and therefore can’t be designed
for.  However opening and closing your
garage door in high winds should produce no noticeable effects.</p>
<p><b>My garage door has a
high sun exposure.</b>  Will these panels
fade over time?  What normally fades over time in the sun isn't the wood, but the applied stain.  The resins crystallize and break down.  But since we use real wood that has been chemically aged, there is no stain to break down and therefore your Garageskins<b><i>™</i></b> panels will darken into that rich look of sun-aged real wood.  Each finish coat also includes a UV-protectant that
should keep your GarageSKins system looking new for years to come.</p>
<p><b>I’m not able to lift
heavy objects.  How heavy is the entire
system and each panel</b>?  Each panel
weighs just over a pound, and even with having to lift the upper panels over
your head to install, there should be no weight issues.  Our complete systems ship out at 28 pounds
maximum, about the weight of a large bag of dog food.</p>
<p><b>Are there any special
tools needed to install a GarageSkins<b><i>™</i></b> system?</b>  No, however you will need a small step-stool
and a wide-blade putty knife to assist in repositioning the panels during
installation. If you have ordered a decorative hardware package you will need a
medium Phillips-head screwdriver to install.</p>
<p><b>My garage door opener
is pretty old.  Will it handle the extra
weight?</b>  We have tested the
GarageSkins system on a 2-car garage door, eight feet tall with a 1/3 HP garage
door opening motor with no problems. However, should you wish to check simply take
a couple of full paint cans (or something with similar weight) and using a wire
coat hanger, open the garage door to a height that allows you to hang the paint
cans from it.  Then move the garage door
up and down to see if there is any issue with the added weight.</p>

to dramatically improve the exterior of your nice home.  Our incredibly 
lightweight panels attach magnetically to your existing metal garage 
door to transform it into a high-end custom carriage-house styled wood 
door.  In less than an hour you can dramatically upgrade the exterior of
 your home for under $1000!


Here's the basic issue:
Millions of Americans own nice, modern homes.. but almost all of those homes have that basic, stamped-metal overhead garage door that's been the staple of the building industry for the past 30 years.  That's because until recently the only other option was to purchase a high-end, real wood garage door, which can cost up to $10,000.  So builders took the easiest and cheapest way out, and just ignored the garage door in the overall architectural planning of most homes, even very high-end ones.  That has resulted in millions of beautiful homes that are stuck with a boring, stamped metal overhead door.And of course homeowners aren't going to go to the time and expense of replacing a perfectly good garage door... so they just turned a blind eye to their boring garage doors, even though that garage door is frequently the largest single structure on the front of their homes... There's just been no cost-effective way to improve it.....
Until now!GarageSkins LLC is bringing the patent-pending GarageSkins real wood garage door overlay systems to market.  This system of incredibly lightweight panels attaches magnetically to your existing overhead metal garage door with no adhesives or screws to give it the look of a high-end custom carriage-house styled garage door, but for a fraction of the price.  You install it!  Just take our panels out of the box, attach them in order to your garage door, and stand back and admire the change.  The strong magnets inside the panels keep it firmly in place, even in high winds.  And the entire installation will take less than an hour to complete, making this amazing upgrade something that almost anyone can do!

At YAK Grills™ we set out to redesign the outdoor charcoal hibachi and create the world's most social grill.

Crafted from 100% Stainless Steel
Grill up to 750ºF (400ºC)
Pre-Built Skewer Notches
Smart Airflow for a Cool Table
Easy to Clean & Dishwasher Safe
Portable Modern Design

Memories are made while cooking together – it's how we form bonds and make new traditions. But grills became sprawling in size and pushed further away from the action, and so was the host – banished to cook alone and miss out on the fun.
It's time to end grilling loneliness and transform outdoor cooking from a solo activity into a shared one – with YAK Grills.
 






 
We combined the best elements of traditional hibachi, a ceramic konro grill, and stainless cookware to create a virtually indestructible and versatile grill. YAK Grills were vigorously tested by professional chefs to ensure they perform for years to come.
 
Simply add your favorite lump charcoal, or try binchotan-style hardwood charcoal logs, and enjoy hours of grilling time. Did someone say yakitori or tapas?

An eco-sustainable choice to reconnect with nature in our homes and fight indoor air pollution for a healthier indoor environment. Mini IQ is able to purify the air and, thanks to the ProSystem N2Smart device by Nuvap, detect the levels of pollutants in your rooms.Progettiamo per il benessere. Un modulo di design dall’aspetto indimenticabile nella sua essenzialità. Una scelta ecosostenibile per ristabilire il nostro legame spirituale con l’ambiente. Da una parte, Mini IQ è un punto di partenza per creare comfort zone dinamiche e d’impatto, in cui respirare a pieni polmoni e meditare sulla semplice bellezza del mondo vegetale. Dall'altra, è in grado di purificare l’aria e, grazie al dispositivo ProSystem N2 Smart, di rilevare i livelli di inquinanti delle nostre stanze.Mini IQ is able to improve the air quality of your homes through a symbiotic bio-filtration process, in which the Bromeliaceae air-plants, characterized by the no-need of soil, draw most of nourishments by absorbing air pollutants, particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These substances are usually suspended in the air of our apartments.Mini IQ was born with the support of the indoor pollution team of the University of Bari. Working with this team, we conducted experiments on the abilities of the plants in the absorption of harmful substances (PM, VOCs). The team is coordinated by Gianluigi De Gennaro, Professor of Environmental Chemistry.For more information on indoor air pollution and health, please see the World Health Organization (WHO) research.La scienza dietro Mini IQ. Mini IQ è in grado di intervenire sulla qualità dell’aria delle nostre case attraverso un processo simbiotico, in cui l’infrastruttura vegetale assorbe le particelle di inquinanti, particolato e composti chimici volatili. Le Bromeliacee selezionate per Mini IQ hanno infatti una grande particolarità: non hanno bisogno di vivere a contatto con il terreno, poiché traggono nutrimento direttamente dalle particelle sospese nell’aria. In questo modo, eliminano le sostanze nocive presenti negli ambienti indoor.Mini IQ nasce con il supporto del team sull’inquinamento indoor dell’Università di Bari, con cui conduciamo esperimenti sulle capacità del mondo vegetale nell’assorbimento delle sostanze nocive. Il team è coordinato dal professor Gianluigi De Gennaro.  In this infographic, you can track the forecast of the pollutants in your house with and without Mini IQ. A recent research, conducted with NUVAP*, produced the important result of a 43% decrease in air pollutants thanks to Mini IQ biofiltration work. Especially during this historical period, where we spend more than 90% of our time indoor, it is essential to improve indoor air quality as much as possible. * NUVAP is a partner of Mini IQ and a company focused on environmental data collection and analysis technologies.In questa infografica è possibile tracciare la previsione degli inquinanti presenti in casa con e senza Mini IQ.

We strive and make it our above all goal to enrich the local communities with quality entertainment and advertising through the means of film, radio, and other web-based outreach. 
Our main goal is to support the local community through our documentary, film, and podcast services. For those who may not know, a “Podcast” is a streamable and downloadable Internet radio/video show. Podcasting is the foundation of Castwave Studios.  Through some years, our podcast “Boldly Going Nowhere” has seen various changes through structure, hosts, guests, and others. Now we have adapted to the fast-paced world that is Internet culture. We realize that short segments of episodes not only boost the numbers but provide listeners a variety of categories of their choosing.
 
 
 
CastWave Studios is also a creator of films and an outlet as well. We take considerable satisfaction in being a host for local films as well as other art. Certain positive stories in the community could, otherwise, be hidden and only be handled by word of mouth. Naturally, this can lead to the spreading of untruth. We at CastWave Studios want and need to be truthful. A Documentary film can deliver your message to the millions upon millions on the web. A picture may be worth a thousand words. Imagine the informational value that a Documentary video can bring.

easier, more satisfying and successful by making personal networks work better.</i></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/885013/files/20140926150512-sage_infographic_map-green.png?1411769112"" src="""" style=""width: 286.12px; height: 153px;""/></p><p></p>
<p>The idea was catalyzed by Robert Downey,
Jr., who was quoted in an article as saying that he had a yoga teacher, a
psychiatrist and a Sensei in his life because he was, after all, not a Model T; he was a Ferrari. He had a point. None of us are Model T’s. Not in today’s complex,
24/7, ‘always on’ world. We all need a pit crew to help keep us going. In fact,
we need several. We call them networks. We’re born into five networks. As we
enter the work world, we gain even more. </p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about this since
2007. (I had a day job and was traveling globally. This was good material for
long flights and late night discussions.) You know what? Not one person could name
all the people in their networks. People willing to try to list them all found
it took close to eight hours and even then, they missed 20% on average. No
one was consciously aware of how they built, managed or used their networks.
Most people felt they were victims of the demands the networks placed on them.
Only rarely did I meet someone who’d strategically managed their networks and
when I did, they wanted help to do it better. </p>
<p>I think I can help. In fact, I know I can
because of the impact that SageMyLife has already had in the personal, family
and work life of so many people.</p>

</div></div>","The SageMyLife StoryI have an idea about how to make life
easier, more satisfying and successful by making personal networks work better.
The idea was catalyzed by Robert Downey,
Jr., who was quoted in an article as saying that he had a yoga teacher, a
psychiatrist and a Sensei in his life because he was, after all, not a Model T; he was a Ferrari. He had a point. None of us are Model T’s. Not in today’s complex,
24/7, ‘always on’ world. We all need a pit crew to help keep us going. In fact,
we need several. We call them networks. We’re born into five networks. As we
enter the work world, we gain even more. 
I’ve been thinking about this since
2007. (I had a day job and was traveling globally. This was good material for
long flights and late night discussions.) You know what? Not one person could name
all the people in their networks. People willing to try to list them all found
it took close to eight hours and even then, they missed 20% on average. No
one was consciously aware of how they built, managed or used their networks.
Most people felt they were victims of the demands the networks placed on them.
Only rarely did I meet someone who’d strategically managed their networks and
when I did, they wanted help to do it better. 
I think I can help. In fact, I know I can
because of the impact that SageMyLife has already had in the personal, family
and work life of so many people.
What is the status of the project?What are the features of the app?

Language neutral – any language


Android, IOS


Guided data entry


Attractive data display


Reflections for network management


Reminders of network support


Allows you to add additional
information (phone numbers)


PDF or print versions


Copy function for children in family


Archived year-to-year


Deal for parents of multiples


Special applications for adoptions
and foster care


Expected time to map: 5 Min



Here’s my request: help us take the next step.  That means helping us fund:

An
explainer video for users


Private
beta testing, including refining the look of the map, assuring it is fast, easy
and intuitive


Translation
of all materials into Spanish and testing with Hispanic parents


And
for our stretch goal, we have two projects in mind. The first integrates our
platform with 3D printers or other methods so that children ages 10 and older
can build their own 3D network maps. The second builds a game we’ve designed
for toddlers and parents through children age 7. 

To get this far, I’ve bootstrapped
the business and had lots of help from friends who used the first three
generations of the tools.  I’ve also had
some help from folks working ‘on spec’ anticipating we’d make it to market. Lots
of people have believed in this along the way. 
Now, we need you! Please support our
campaign and claim the awesome perks we’re offering to our backers. SageMyLife Reach 
We’ve worked globally and want to
offer SageMyLife to anyone who’d like to use it. The web is going to make that
easier. Many people around the world speak English and since our networks are
global, we anticipate that some English-speaking people outside the US will
benefit. Our Spanish translation will help Spanish-speaking people wherever
they live as well. 
Our platform is not language
dependent and is immediately responsive in whatever language we provide. It’s only
a matter of time before we find the partners to help us assure that SageMyLife
is available to people in all the major world languages. About the perks! You can be part of the first-ever App to
help parents better manage their child’s networks. 
The program you’d be supporting is
going to do a lot. 
It will help people name everyone in
their personal network and track how the network changes over time. This is
relevant as children grow up and as parents try to manage those networks over
time. Our tool will help parents create
maps to quantify and qualify people in their children’s networks now.  
It will help them see how complex
those networks become when families blend. And, it will help all families
manage better.  
Why Start with Young Children’s Networks? 
¿Por qué empezar con las redes de los niños pequeños?

Personal networks are
an important part of life. Networks affect health, wealth and happiness. In fact, we
could not survive without them. Yet, networks can be problematic if they are
too complex or poorly managed.  
Las redes personales son una parte
importante de la vida. Redes afectan la salud , la riqueza y la felicidad. De
hecho, no podríamos sobrevivir sin ellos. Sin embargo, las redes pueden ser
problemáticos si son demasiado complicados o manejadas mal.
Parents are responsible
for managing their children’s networks. Children are born into networks and as they grow,
create networks of their own. Parents are responsible for assuring the people
in a child’s network will help keep the child healthy, safe and developing
well, especially when the parent is not there to supervise.  
Los padres son responsables de
manejar las redes de sus hijos. Los niños nacen en las redes ya al medio que
crecen, crean sus propias redes. Los padres son responsables de asegurar a la
gente en la red de un hijo le ayudará a mantener al niño sano, seguro y
desarrollando así , sobre todo cuando el padre no está allí para supervisor.  
There are no robust
tools to help parents understand or manage children’s networks. Children’s networks are largely
ignored, even in parenting literature and classes. As people pursue their
personal and career-life goals and then add parenting to the mix, their network
“bandwidth” is stretched to the breaking point far too often. This can add to a
parent’s sense of overwhelm. 
No hay herramientas sólidas para
ayudar a los padres a entender o manejar las redes de los niños. Redes de los
niños son ignorados , incluso en la crianza de la literatura y clases . Como la
gente persigue sus metas personales y de la vida profesional y luego añadir la
paternidad a la mezcla, su red se estira hasta el límite con demasiada
frecuencia. Esto puede añadir a la sensación de los padres de abrumar.
People lose touch with
their own networks when children are born. Networks provide important social support during
times of stress. Losing touch with personal networks is now known to be a major
reason why marital and job satisfaction decline with the birth of a child. It
is also a major cause of post-partum depression and has been implicated in
child abuse.
Las personas pierden el contacto con
sus propias redes , cuando nacen los niños. Las redes proporcionan un
importante apoyo social durante momentos de estrés. Perder contacto con las
redes personales ahora se sabe que es una razón importante por la disminución
de la satisfacción marital y trabajo con el nacimiento de un niño. También es
una causa importante de depresión post -parto y se ha implicado en el abuso infantile.



Parents face new management challenges with the birth of each child. A second child does not add “just one more” person to a family. Each new child adds an exponential number of

<p>We love life, we love each other and food is our third boyfriend! We like to dance, sing and get naked while we cook, so why not make a cooking show about that. Sexy Funny Kitchen was created, and a Sexy Family was born. The Kitchen was ugly, and it was time to make it beautiful! We build it with our hands, and now we are stuck in a phase where we need help to finish it. Do you wanna help? We will totally make it worth it! Promise! </p>

<div>We always had so much fun on our cooking marathons. We couldn't stop singing, dancing and destroying the Kitchen at the same time. But all of this always happened in a very ""undressed way""...<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453958995/avzq7krckdw6ahjl9ubz.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 309px; height: 309px;""/></p>
</div>
<div>Every time we were watching our favorite cooking shows, we always found them a bit boring and old fashioned! Nothing against it, but there was something missing.</div>
<div>Food is Life, and Life is supposed to be Funny and Sexy! So why couldn't exist a cooking show where the recipes were explained step by step, but with a pinch of Sexiness and a Funny flavor? There's no reason why! </div>
<div>So we created SEXY FUNNY KITCHEN! A homemade cooking show, a place where we could share our favorite recipes, but with the same energy and excitement as we did when we were alone at home! </div>

</div>
<div>Of course the energy was always high, the fun was always present and the sexiness become a must, but we never forgot about the food! The food is like our main actor! Its where we spend most of our time, we don't just cook it. We think about it, we try it once, twice and we make it perfect. And when its ready we press the record button! And usually the result is food porn!</div>

</div>
<p>After the first 10 episodes, we realize there were a lot of people that couldn't wait for the next Thursday, to have their weekly dose of Fun, Sexiness and Foodporn!</p>
<p>We called them, our Sexy Family! And its not only a cool name, its what describes them! They are all Sexy, not physically talking, they are Sexy because they share the same passion for life as we do, they have sense of humor and they love food! They made us smile SO much with all the pictures they sent from their food creations, and the way they interact with us, it made us feel a real connection, not as friends, as a Family, a Sexy Family!</p>
<p>We had <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlGRLgDfxzo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a really intense and crazy 2015</a>!!! But not only for everything that happened. Most of all, due to our little secret from our Sexy Family! We were building a new Kitchen for them. We couldn't afford to buy it, or to pay for someone to build it, so we started a slow process of cleaning our garage, design a new kitchen, find wood on the forests near home, buying construction materials, learn about pluming and electricity, and after 6 months, of intense days working on it, it was finally Perfect! Our little baby! The NEW Sexy Funny Kitchen!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The biggest dream would just be able to do this! Cooking is our biggest hobby, and we really would love to make this project a way of living, because there is nothing better than do what you love the most, full time!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">And its not only about the food, we also like the cinematographic side of it!</p>
<p>We really love all the processes of making a cooking show, from having the ideia, , buying the ingredients, testing it, filming it, doing nice shoots, editing, and we always like to watch the final result in our TV screen, like if it was a movie time!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">But there were a couple of times, where Sexy Funny Kitchen was not on our TV screen because we were plugging a cable on it. We got a really nice surprise when the biggest channel of our country invited us to go there and share one of our recipes! And we did it, and we loved it! The feedback was also amazing, and after that we were invited to a couple more.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It was not only positive because of the food, but also due to the fact that in our Country, you don't see a open gay couple on television. Most of all, dancing, singing, cooking and losing some pieces of clothe! :D </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We feel that by doing this passion we have, we are also helping others, to feel more free, to lose fear and to believe that any relationship, no matter what is the sexual orientation, can be Happy. Genuinely happy!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">That was one of the many reasons why ILGA gave us an award in January 2016.</p>

Portuguese,Stupid,Ridiculous,Not Funny,In love,Passionate,Equal,Strong,Foodies
We are Lorenzo and Pedro

SHORT STORY!

We love life, we love each other and food is our third boyfriend! We like to dance, sing and get naked while we cook, so why not make a cooking show about that. Sexy Funny Kitchen was created, and a Sexy Family was born. The Kitchen was ugly, and it was time to make it beautiful! We build it with our hands, and now we are stuck in a phase where we need help to finish it. Do you wanna help? We will totally make it worth it! Promise! 
ps: for the LONG version read bellow!




LONG VERSION!

We are Lorenzo and Pedro, a really happy couple from Portugal. We meet in 2012 in a very unusual way and the first think we found in common was our HUGE passion for food! But eating it was not the best part, the process of cooking was definitely the CLIMAX! 

We always had so much fun on our cooking marathons. We couldn't stop singing, dancing and destroying the Kitchen at the same time. But all of this always happened in a very ""undressed way""...

Every time we were watching our favorite cooking shows, we always found them a bit boring and old fashioned! Nothing against it, but there was something missing.
Food is Life, and Life is supposed to be Funny and Sexy! So why couldn't exist a cooking show where the recipes were explained step by step, but with a pinch of Sexiness and a Funny flavor? There's no reason why! 
So we created SEXY FUNNY KITCHEN! A homemade cooking show, a place where we could share our favorite recipes, but with the same energy and excitement as we did when we were alone at home! 



Of course the energy was always high, the fun was always present and the sexiness become a must, but we never forgot about the food! The food is like our main actor! Its where we spend most of our time, we don't just cook it. We think about it, we try it once, twice and we make it perfect. And when its ready we press the record button! And usually the result is food porn!




After the first 10 episodes, we realize there were a lot of people that couldn't wait for the next Thursday, to have their weekly dose of Fun, Sexiness and Foodporn!
We called them, our Sexy Family! And its not only a cool name, its what describes them! They are all Sexy, not physically talking, they are Sexy because they share the same passion for life as we do, they have sense of humor and they love food! They made us smile SO much with all the pictures they sent from their food creations, and the way they interact with us, it made us feel a real connection, not as friends, as a Family, a Sexy Family!
We had a really intense and crazy 2015!!! But not only for everything that happened. Most of all, due to our little secret from our Sexy Family! We were building a new Kitchen for them. We couldn't afford to buy it, or to pay for someone to build it, so we started a slow process of cleaning our garage, design a new kitchen, find wood on the forests near home, buying construction materials, learn about pluming and electricity, and after 6 months, of intense days working on it, it was finally Perfect! Our little baby! The NEW Sexy Funny Kitchen!



 Now we got to a point where we need help to finish this. We really can't afford all the missing parts. And that is why you are reading all of this in the 
Indiegogo website :) 
   We need but We also give <3
To make this Kitchen fully functional and 100% ready we need more than what we are asking, the 2000$ . But this number its enough to start recording on it and give a fresh face to our baby, Sexy Funny Kitchen!
This money will be used to buy a second hand stove, oven, microwave, some appliances, plates, glasses, simple cool decoration, some lights, and to fix a old fridge we have. But when you receive you should always give back, and that's why we created some really cool incentives! From postcards from Portugal, to a box full of tradicional goodies or having your picture or quote in the New Kitchen wall or you can just have awesome holidays in our cosy beach home! And if you are wild enough you can even fly us to your city, and we will be your personal Sexy Chefs!
But there is more...
   Sexy Funny Kitchen BIGGEST achievement! 
The biggest dream would just be able to do this! Cooking is our biggest hobby, and we really would love to make this project a way of living, because there is nothing better than do what you love the most, full time!
And its not only about the food, we also like the cinematographic side of it!
We really love all the processes of making a cooking show, from having the ideia, , buying the ingredients, testing it, filming it, doing nice shoots, editing, and we always like to watch the final result in our TV screen, like if it was a movie time!
But there were a couple of times, where Sexy Funny Kitchen was not on our TV screen because we were plugging a cable on it. We got a really nice surprise when the biggest channel of our country invited us to go there and share one of our recipes! And we did it, and we loved it! The feedback was also amazing, and after that we were invited to a couple more.
It was not only positive because of the food, but also due to the fact that in our Country, you don't see a open gay couple on television. Most of all, dancing, singing, cooking and losing some pieces of clothe! :D 
We feel that by doing this passion we have, we are also helping others, to feel more free, to lose fear and to believe that any relationship, no matter what is the sexual orientation, can be Happy. Genuinely happy!
That was one of the many reasons why ILGA gave us an award in January 2016.
Because they know, what we know, Love is to beautiful to be inside a closet, or should we say, inside a kitchen cabinet <3 


    
    Other Ways You Can Help
As that gorgeous lady said in our Indiegogo Video Campaign, if you can't donate, no problem! We love you the same way as we did before! And if you are new to us, we totally understand it, you can just sit down and enjoy the show.
That would be already a big smile in our faces!
But if you would like to help anyway, just help us sharing our words and use the indiegogo share tools, so we can make this Kitchen gorgeous, and this Sexy Family, even bigger! 
And of course, if you like what you see, and you still haven't subscribe, you can join the Sexy Family now, by clicking here <3

We would like to remind our backers to use good-quality power banks only. Since we cannot know the quality of your power bank, thus have to state that the performance of VentiFresh may vary depending on the power bank of your choice, and any damage caused by the third party product cannot be covered by our standard warranty.</p><p><strong>Q: How long do I need to turn it on every day? </strong></p><p>Depending on where you use VentiFresh, the time needed to deodorize the air varies and can be decided by yourself. VentiFresh is designed to process air in small enclosed spaces, and it runs at power on. Just plug in when you feel the need to freshen up. For more stinky places, you may keep it running for more than 10 hours a day, no problem.  </p><p><strong>Q: Can it really remove all the odor? To what extent? </strong></p><p>The current model of VentiFresh is designed to process odors in normal household, like the trash cans that you may throw a bit of everything inside, such as leftovers or product wraps. The stench that you usually smell are mainly ammonia, some types of sulfide compounds, etc., and we collectively called them “volatile organic compounds”. The more active they are, the easier for you to smell them, and the faster VentiFresh can process them. The technology we used has been proved effective on several types of organic compounds (odors), and different compound may react at different pace. Generally speaking, as long as the smelly material is present, the odors will be there, and VentiFresh works to neutralize the active odors, thus reducing the concentration you can sense. In some of our tests, the ammonia odor concentration was removed more than 80% after a 10min cycle.       </p><p><strong>Q: Does the product need maintenance? How do I clean it? </strong></p><p>VentiFresh is hassle free, just plug in the power and a build-in light sensor controls the on/off. There is nearly no maintenance required, there’s no replacing filter or refill parts.  </p><p>See the Product Specs above for care instructions.   </p><p><strong>Q: Why do I need it? How is it better than other products? </strong></p><p>VentiFresh does not use chemicals to mask odors, add fragrance to a pool of already staled smells, or produce harmful by-products. It’s easy to use, easy to install and is energy-efficient. You can use it until the end of it’s life, which by design is estimated to be 10,000 hours. </p><p><strong>Q: Will it use much electricity? </strong></p><p>If you keep a VentiFresh running for 24 hours, it would cost less than $0.40 (residential rate) per month in most American states. Power costs refer to the latest average price of electricity by the US Department of Energy.   <a href=""https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_table_grapher.cfm?t=epmt_5_6_a"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_tab...</a> </p><p><strong>Q: Does it work on all kinds of trash can? </strong></p><p>Yes, long as the can is within our recommended size limit of 45L and has a lid. VentiFresh is designed to fit pedal bins. </p><p><strong>Q: How strong is the magnet? Will it fall easily? </strong></p><p>We run some tests in open/close cycles of pedal bins by stepping on the cans with reasonable force and the VentiFresh stayed attached. </p><p>There is one magnet at the bottom of the VentiFresh, and one with the included accessory Mag Dot. Mag Dot is designed so that VentiFresh can work with plastic lid by sandwiching the lid in between the VentiFresh and the Mag Dot.  </p><p><strong>Q: Is it harmful for human body? </strong></p><p><u><strong>UV</strong></u></p><p>The product has passed Photobiological Safety Testing (IEC62471), which tested UV lighting reaction with animal eyes. Our product is classified as no hazard “exempt class”. It is safe to you and your pets.</p><p>Our team is expert in handling opto-semiconductor products. Opto-semiconductor deals with quantum mechanical effects of light. We used UV LED, a type of opto-semiconductor, in the VentiFresh as light source, which offers just the right amount of energy to activate the process. The UV light power is sealed inside the VentiFresh housing, preventing direct viewing and exposure. In addition, since the product is designed to work in a dark space (inside an enclosed container), the build-in light sensor turns off the product when you open the lid or door of the container, further reduce the chance seeing the UV light.</p><p>In the figure of the speech, the peak energy of the UVA module inside VentiFresh is about 20% of the strength of what we experience under a regular sunny day in the open air.</p><p><strong><u>By-Products</u> </strong></p><p>There are speculations on various types of photocatalyst products producing harmful by-products (chemicals) in the industrial environments. It is not related to our product design and usage for the following reasons: </p><ol>
<li>VentiFresh is used and designed for household use, not industrial environments where toxic chemicals are already present, and by-products may be possibly generated from processing these chemicals.   </li>
<li>VentiFresh uses low-power (DC 5V) driving current for the UV light source, same for the USB power adaptors used by a mobile phone. We don’t use high-voltage electrical-discharge based ionization technology, which may produce a small amount of by-product, ozone. There is no ozone presence throughout our process.  </li>
<li>The UV photocatalyst process of VentiFresh mainly converts odor compounds into water vapor and carbon dioxide, in very small, almost undetectable amounts. The capacity of VentiFresh yields less than the same by-products compare with a regular adult human activity for the same period of time. Animals also breathe in air (a mixture of compounds) and exhale mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide.  </li>
</ol><p><strong>Q: Does installing VentiFresh to my trash can means that I can keep the garbage in house longer? </strong></p><p>We still recommend that you take out the trash daily or when needed. After all, there may be other issues in concern other than smells.  </p><p>VentiFresh works in a way that it helps to reduce some bad odors by decomposing them into harmless air, so not only it would smell better, but also freshen up your indoor air. The odors don’t just get released from a container and become diluted by your room air, thus escaping your smell sense. They’re transformed into part of nature air compounds. </p><p>However, if the bad-odor materials piling up inside the container got to a point that exceed the processing capacity of the product, it would take much longer to reduce the smell and affect its performance.  </p><p> </p><p><strong>Have any questions not listed here? </strong></p><p>Send us a message through the <strong><u>Ask a Question</u></strong> link above.</p><p><strong>Interested in writing about us? </strong></p><p>Our press kit is available for download <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mc53qzov78me24h/AACBZ_5l4U595SQ9lkhHhCksa?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and Challenges</h2><p>Our team has been working with opto-semiconductor and electronic product development for more than 10 years, and we teamed up with equally experienced factory partners.

TURN YOUR TRASH CAN INTO AN ODOR KILLER
 WORKS ON DIFFERENT LIDS  NO FILTER NEEDED HOW IT WORKSVentiFresh combined the semiconductor deodorizer technology and air ventilation techniques, in such a compact function that has never been seen before.The applied semiconductors consisted of photocatalyst and UV LED. A photocatalyst is a natural or synthetic substance that accelerates the rate of a molecular reaction using energy from light, without consuming itself. Chlorophyll of plants is a typical nature photocatalyst. We used a compound mainly consisted of titanium  dioxide (TiO2).Simply speaking, our technology reversed the process of how plants breathe, and was used  to deodorize stinky molecules in the air.While chlorophyll captures sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose, our nano-grade substance at contact breaks down volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or odors in gas form, into carbon dioxide and water. Using a dust-resistant, low-noise motor fan, bad odor molecules in the air are pressured to flow inside an air compartment, get processed with a photocatalyst energized by UV light, then clean air flows out of VentiFresh through air vents on the sides. Since the reaction is chemistry at molecular level, odor compounds here are decomposed rather than captured by a filter, so there’s nothing to be replaced or refilled. Only needs energy from UV light to activate the cleaning process. The use of effective ventilation with photocatalyst and UV lighting for indoor air treatment has been a mature application used in many places such as factories, hospitals, labs and homes. Such systems usually cost thousands of dollars to start with, and often are installed inside the existing air ventilation with professional services.NASA has also adopted this type of technology to keep the environment clean on the International Space Station**(ref: NASA Spinoff Page). Now with UV LED delivering higher power output to enable commercial sales, we're able to reform the concept, made a compact and portable unit, and applied this proven technology to address small storage spaces in our households. VentiFresh proved what used to be a million-dollar technology can become useful home products. And with no consumables and very low power consumption, VentiFresh demonstrated our committment to contribute to sustainable lifestyles with technical advancements.**VentiFresh is not an affiliate or associates with NASA and Spinoff. All trademarks, names and service marks mentioned herein belong to their respective owners.** The motor fan used in VentiFresh features dust-resistance and S&C (Seal and Clip) technology. The advantage of this design is to prevent the stator and impeller from moving, providing better dust-resistance, higher reliability, and longer life expectancy.  LAB TESTEDWe took VentiFresh on a test of performance using ammonia. As you know, ammonia is a colorless, highly irritating gas with a pungent, suffocating odor. This is a perfect example for us to test on how well VentiFresh performs.In the video below, we had it tested in a 40L can filled with ammonia. You can see how VentiFresh successfully processed the ammonia odor only within 10 minutes.  WHAT'S IN THE BOX*Available in EU and US plugs   Design InspirationVentiFresh is our latest innovation applying opto-semiconductor technology to solve an everyday problem. Inspired by the fact that the same technology was used at the International Space Station, we're encouraged to bring the high-tech benefits to everyone's home.  For this reason, special attention was given to product design to balance functions with aesthetic appearance.  For example, the front air inflow vent was designed with a pattern of geometrical triangle vector that moderates air flow speed, allowing gas but not dust to enter the air cycle compartment. The progress of the UV LED developments in recent years also made the production of VentiFresh for personal uses technically and financially viable. VentiFresh is another evidence of ""possibility turns into reality"" because of nonstop efforts and imagination.  FAQ Q: Can I use any USB power bank with VentiFresh?For short-term portable use, all retailed USB power banks (sorry, no lightning connector) may work with VentiFresh as long as the power current of the battery output is DC5V, just like using power bank to charge a mobile phone. We would like to remind our backers to use good-quality power banks only. Since we cannot know the quality of your power bank, thus have to state that the performance of VentiFresh may vary depending on the power bank of your choice, and any damage caused by the third party product cannot be covered by our standard warranty.Q: How long do I need to turn it on every day? Depending on where you use VentiFresh, the time needed to deodorize the air varies and can be decided by yourself. VentiFresh is designed to process air in small enclosed spaces, and it runs at power on. Just plug in when you feel the need to freshen up. For more stinky places, you may keep it running for more than 10 hours a day, no problem.  Q: Can it really remove all the odor? To what extent? The current model of VentiFresh is designed to process odors in normal household, like the trash cans that you may throw a bit of everything inside, such as leftovers or product wraps. The stench that you usually smell are mainly ammonia, some types of sulfide compounds, etc., and we collectively called them “volatile organic compounds”. The more active they are, the easier for you to smell them, and the faster VentiFresh can process them. The technology we used has been proved effective on several types of organic compounds (odors), and different compound may react at different pace. Generally speaking, as long as the smelly material is present, the odors will be there, and VentiFresh works to neutralize the active odors, thus reducing the concentration you can sense. In some of our tests, the ammonia odor concentration was removed more than 80% after a 10min cycle.       Q: Does the product need maintenance? How do I clean it? VentiFresh is hassle free, just plug in the power and a build-in light sensor controls the on/off. There is nearly no maintenance required, there’s no replacing filter or refill parts.  See the Product Specs above for care instructions.   Q: Why do I need it? How is it better than other products? VentiFresh does not use chemicals to mask odors, add fragrance to a pool of already staled smells, or produce harmful by-products. It’s easy to use, easy to install and is energy-efficient. You can use it until the end of it’s life, which by design is estimated to be 10,000 hours. Q: Will it use much electricity? If you keep a VentiFresh running for 24 hours, it would cost less than $0.40 (residential rate) per month in most American states. Power costs refer to the latest average price of electricity by the US Department of Energy.   https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_tab... Q: Does it work on all kinds of trash can? Yes, long as the can is within our recommended size limit of 45L and has a lid. VentiFresh is designed to fit pedal bins. Q: How strong is the magnet? Will it fall easily? We run some tests in open/close cycles of pedal bins by stepping on the cans with reasonable force and the VentiFresh stayed attached. There is one magnet at the bottom of the VentiFresh, and one with the included accessory Mag Dot. Mag Dot is designed so that VentiFresh can work with plastic lid by sandwiching the lid in between the VentiFresh and the Mag Dot.  Q: Is it harmful for human body? UVThe product has passed Photobiological Safety Testing (IEC62471), which tested UV lighting reaction with animal eyes. Our product is classified as no hazard “exempt class”. It is safe to you and your pets.Our team is expert in handling opto-semiconductor products. Opto-semiconductor deals with quantum mechanical effects of light. We used UV LED, a type of opto-semiconductor, in the VentiFresh as light source, which offers just the right amount of energy to activate the process. The UV light power is sealed inside the VentiFresh housing, preventing direct viewing and exposure. In addition, since the product is designed to work in a dark space (inside an enclosed container), the build-in light sensor turns off the product when you open the lid or door of the container, further reduce the chance seeing the UV light.In the figure of the speech, the peak energy of the UVA module inside VentiFresh is about 20% of the strength of what we experience under a regular sunny day in the open air.By-Products There are speculations on various types of photocatalyst products producing harmful by-products (chemicals) in the industrial environments. It is not related to our product design and usage for the following reasons: 
VentiFresh is used and designed for household use, not industrial environments where toxic chemicals are already present, and by-products may be possibly generated from processing these chemicals.   
VentiFresh uses low-power (DC 5V) driving current for the UV light source, same for the USB power adaptors used by a mobile phone. We don’t use high-voltage electrical-discharge based ionization technology, which may produce a small amount of by-product, ozone. There is no ozone presence throughout our process.  
The UV photocatalyst process of VentiFresh mainly converts odor compounds into water vapor and carbon dioxide, in very small, almost undetectable amounts. The capacity of VentiFresh yields less than the same by-products compare with a regular adult human activity for the same period of time. Animals also breathe in air (a mixture of compounds) and exhale mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide.  
Q: Does installing VentiFresh to my trash can means that I can keep the garbage in house longer? We still recommend that you take out the trash daily or when needed. After all, there may be other issues in concern other than smells.  VentiFresh works in a way that it helps to reduce some bad odors by decomposing them into harmless air, so not only it would smell better, but also freshen up your indoor air. The odors don’t just get released from a container and become diluted by your room air, thus escaping your smell sense. They’re transformed into part of nature air compounds. However, if the bad-odor materials piling up inside the container got to a point that exceed the processing capacity of the product, it would take much longer to reduce the smell and affect its performance.   Have any questions not listed here? Send us a message through the Ask a Question link above.Interested in writing about us?

<strong>Get Yours Now at <a href=""https://www.wearespruce.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.wearespruce.co</a></strong><br/> </h2></div>","Available now at www.wearespruce.coSingle-use plastic packaging and toxic chemicals in everyday cleaning products are hurting you and the planet. At Spruce, our mission is to make eco-friendly, non-toxic cleaning products that are convenient to use and beautiful to look at. Our Eternity aluminium bottles can be refilled endlessly. Concentrated refills come in plastic-free packaging. Refill with tap water at home. Zero plastic waste sent to the oceans. Zero water shipped.We'll also remove 25 bottles worth of ocean-bound plastic waste for each pledge.   Our circular design gets rid of single-use plastics and the need to ship water. We're starting by making cleaning clean. Our refillable products are convenient, safe and environmentally-friendly.   Three simple steps for you - a giant leap in ending single-use plastic pollution. Get your endlessly refillable Eternity bottle once and plastic-free refills delivered to your door.     No need to shake or shimmy. Clean within minutes. Get Yours Now at www.wearespruce.coThe Bottle: Use our Eternity aluminium bottles for over hundreds of cleanings and send absolutely zero single-use plastic waste to landfills. Aluminium is the world's most recycled material. 80% of aluminium in use today is recycled. Our bottles won’t break or leach toxic chemicals into the contents. Get Yours Now at www.wearespruce.co  The Refills: Our lightweight refill pack weighs only 4 grams. That is 140 times less than a typical cleaning bottle that weighs 560 grams. Zero water shipped. Our refills fit through your letterbox and get delivered with significantly low carbon footprint.   Do Non-Toxic Cleaning Products Work?The safe, plant-based surfactants we use in our formulations are effective against common viruses and bacteria as they attack and dissolve the fatty layer that holds the virus particles together, or in the case of bacteria, they dissolve the cell membrane. As a result the microbes fall apart and become deactivated.This is the same principle as washing your hands with soap and water, without the need to use antibacterial products. In effect surfactants work differently from toxic antibacterial agents (pesticides) that kill the bacteria (note: antibacterials are effective against bacteria not viruses).Our safe ingredients such as Citric Acid and organic essential oils contain antimicrobial properties. We don’t and will never use pesticides and harsh antibacterial agents in our products as research shows they do more harm than good. We have shared more data in our FAQ’s if you are interested in learning more about this topic.The ProductHere are the products we are launching with, with lots more on the horizon.Cleans limescale and soap scum from bathroom surfaces. Good for sinks, tiles and tubs. Get rid of grease and grime. Use on tiles, countertops, stone, wood and most sealed surfaces. And there is much more in the pipeline to make your home a single-use plastic-free zone.  But we want to launch our campaign with these two products and incorporate your direct feedback in our future product launches. Be part of our journey. Get Yours Now at www.wearespruce.co We made it on the Dezeen Awards 2020 shortlist in the Sustainable Design category! There is nothing as chic as a clean conscience and a Spruce bottle.   Get Yours Now at www.wearespruce.co The environmental impact and carbon emissions of shipping packaged water is a serious issue. Did you know:  We only ship active ingredients in our refill packs which you can dilute in tap water at home. This dramatically lowers our carbon footprint. Our refill packs weigh just 4 grams vs. 560 grams of a typical cleaning product.Cleaning products aren’t well-regulated. Manufacturers get away with selling cocktails of harmful ingredients without the need to declare them. And it’s making us sick. When everyday cleaning ingredients like chlorine and ammonia mix together, they react and release toxic fumes that can be fatal.  If your everyday home cleaning product requires you to wear protective gear (masks, gloves?), you can be sure that it is not a safe choice for your family. Need we say more? It's time to stop paying for that extra streak-free shine with your health.  We tried the existing ""eco"" options, but they don't really work. Eco-friendly products are useless if they come in single-use plastics (there should really be a law against labelling single-use plastics as ""eco""). We all know that recycling is broken (less than 9% of all plastic has ever been recycled), bioplastics are still an enigma, and who doesn't love carrying bulky liquids from zero-waste refill stores?  Safe for Humans & for the Planet: We only use non-toxic and environmentally friendly ingredients. All our ingredients rate highly on the EWG.org healthy cleaning guide and are food or cosmetic-grade. We use 100 percent natural and organic essential oils for their antibacterial properties and natural fragrance. The Spruce Banned Ingredients List: Being plastic-free is not enough. Our products are free from SLS, Phthalates, Phosphates, Triclosan, Quaternium-15 DMDM Hydantoin, Parabens, Ammonia, EDTA, Chlorine, Formaldehyde, Palm-oil, nuts, Petrochemicals, Bleach, VOCs, Ethanolamine Compounds (DEA, TEA, MEA), harsh chemical antibacterial agents and pesticides.  Zero Plastic Sent to the Oceans: Our refill packaging is certified plastic-free made from cellulose. It will decompose into biomass as opposed to plastic bottles that will live on in our ecosystem for centuries. Zero Water Shipped: We only send you active ingredients that you can dilute in tap water at home. Not shipping water will dramatically lower our carbon footprint. For the occasional spill...   Spruce & Spritz  Clean up kitchen mess.. Get your bathroom sparkly clean. Clean up soap scum on tubs, tiles and ceramics.    Get Yours Now at www.wearespruce.co People & Planet before Profit. We're a Certified B-Corp Pending. B Corporations are businesses that balance purpose and profit. They’re legally bound to consider the impact they make on the planet, community and environment, and not prioritise profit.  Always Give Back: With every order placed, we'll contribute towards collection of ocean-bound plastic waste with the help of our partner Plastic Bank, a social enterprise.  We'll collect and remove 1kg of ocean-bound plastics with every order.   Support United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:  We're aligned with the UN SDG's below to promote responsible consumption and production, prevent climate change and protect our oceans.Get Yours Now at www.wearespruce.co I first got exposed to the hazardous chemicals in both plastics and everyday personal care and cleaning products 10 years ago, after suffering from back-to-back health issues. I realised we are surrounded by hidden toxins in most products from our food to cookware to personal care and home cleaning products. I swapped daily products and where I couldn’t find alternatives, I made my own. My journey so far had been driven by a focus on healthy living. I also became aware that despite considering myself “eco-aware”, I still had a significant plastic-footprint from everyday use items that just don’t come plastic-free. So, I decided to fix a problem that I faced. Our mission is to make eco-friendly accessible, without compromising on quality and convenience - Mahira, Founder.Proudly Female-led

<p>We will also publish Adaprox SDK for programmers to control Adaprox devices. With Adaprox SDK and Fingerbot, you can customize your program to interact physically with the real world.</p>
<p>Consider a situation where you need to connect your server with a local client program. When the server crashes for some reason, sometimes you have to manually reboot the server by pressing the power button, which is very troublesome and annoying.</p>
<p>Kindly follow us on Github, <a href=""https://github.com/Adaprox"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://github.com/Adaprox</a>, and you will be notified once we publish the repository.</p>
<p>The following is a simple programming example that shows how easy it is to utilize Fingerbot… </p>

<div data-id=""27477754""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/477/754/e5d29b1daa96134f1b5507435c26460b_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1576064183&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=2deb61cd4f864c84c829b141d19cb6dc"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p></figure></div>
<p>Now you can make Fingerbot as a physical rebooter and integrate it into your server code. You can simply define and register the action as follows:</p>
<div data-id=""27485454""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/485/454/9bf74d467c35c02f15ddfa54e53273ad_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1576129014&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ff9e426c89234a9caf5470fe638779dd"" src=""""/></p></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Where ""click"" and ""wait"" are the names of predefined actions and ""reboot_action"" describes a sequential robot action:</p>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>Click and hold the button for 10 seconds to force shut down the server<br/> </li>
<li>Wait for 5 seconds<br/> </li>
<li>Click the power button to restart the server</li>

</div></div>","Upgrading your house to the convenience of home automation is a daunting task. Different protocols and different compatibilities for every device or appliance makes the transition difficult. Replacing all the existing appliances with IoT devices is possible, but it is extremely costly. Imagine if there was a way to enjoy the benefits of customized smart home automation at a fraction of the cost…
 

 
Today, it's no longer a problem. We created Fingerbot, the world’s smallest robot which can remotely & mechanically control all the buttons, switches, and toggles anywhere in your home through voice and app. A quick, simple and affordable way to retrofit your existing devices into IoT devices.

Super Easy to Install
 
Fingerbot is easy to install without the need for special tools. It attaches using strong 3M tape to secure it in place near the desired switch. Or you can get creative and do-it-yourself using magnets, Velcro, and more. You can easily remove the Fingerbots without damaging walls or appliances and reuse them again on a different device.  
 

 
 Adjustable Spacers for Different Switch Types 
 
Add a spacer according to your switch type, or replace the robot arm based on your needs. It is as simple as that.


 

 
We will also publish Adaprox SDK for programmers to control Adaprox devices. With Adaprox SDK and Fingerbot, you can customize your program to interact physically with the real world.
Consider a situation where you need to connect your server with a local client program. When the server crashes for some reason, sometimes you have to manually reboot the server by pressing the power button, which is very troublesome and annoying.
Kindly follow us on Github, https://github.com/Adaprox, and you will be notified once we publish the repository.
The following is a simple programming example that shows how easy it is to utilize Fingerbot… 
 

 
Now you can make Fingerbot as a physical rebooter and integrate it into your server code. You can simply define and register the action as follows:
 

 
Where ""click"" and ""wait"" are the names of predefined actions and ""reboot_action"" describes a sequential robot action:
 

Click and hold the button for 10 seconds to force shut down the server 
Wait for 5 seconds 
Click the power button to restart the server

 
After registering the robot action, you can call it when you need it:
 

 
When the client program detects that the server has crashed, Fingerbot will help automatically reboot it. 
 
Long battery life
 
Fingerbot comes with a built-in rechargeable battery that can last 6 months depending on the usage. 
 

 
Fingerbot comes with a USB Type-C charging technology that fully charges the Fingerbot within 1 hour. Then it can get back to work for another half year!
 

 
 Practical and helpful

 
Fingerbot can be a friendly and useful assistant for elderly and disabled people, giving them more independence in the home.

<br/>Short Summary</h3><p>This is a Two Minute Turtle Timer.  It helps children, and grown-ups, visualize time-- and gives them ownership over their daily tasks. After our child's first dentist appointment, she had 9 cavities.  She was one of the 42% of American children ages 2-11 with cavities.  We needed help motivating her to take time to brush teeth at bedtime--but she was tired and we were tired too.  This timer helped and she hasn't had cavities since--she presses the timer button and the first LED light blinks, for 30 seconds and off she goes, brushing each part evenly until her whole mouth is brushed.  No downloading! No iphones in the sink! No plugging in!  Just a child quietly brushing on her own for 2 minutes.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-bukket-ext-bukket-draggable=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493805707/rfzbmpc4t8krhqwka9zx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The timer is 2 diameters long and 1/2 inch thick.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-bukket-ext-bukket-draggable=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493829899/uksznpkupvsugpoyybkv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-bukket-ext-bukket-draggable=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495075083/xazscghxfgtgaoggbtsq.png"" src=""""/></h3><h3>How Does The Timer Work?</h3><p>The timer fits in a child's hand.  It can stick to the mirror (but does not leave a mark on the mirror) or rest on the sink.  The child pushes the button and the first LEDs blinks, representing one quadrant of the mouth.

We were tired of owning a million towels and doing endless loads of laundry. Between the two of us we owned around 30 towels! Of those, only 5 were useable, the other 25 were just too musty to dry off with.
The solution to our problems was the self-cleaning Kanso Towel, featuring a waffle weave design and Polygiene Stay Fresh technology. 




Polygiene’s permanent textile treatment is bluesign® approved which means it meets rigorous independent environmental and product life cycle standards. It is also Oeko-tex tested and certified.



Lifetime Stay-Fresh Guarantee: If your Kanso Towel (through normal use) begins to smell musty, you can send it back for a new towel or a full refund.



The Kanso towel is self-cleaning, fast drying and anti-microbial, meaning you can dry off with a fresh, odor-free towel every time; no added laundry required.

Adding additional towels to your pledge can be done by simply adding the price of the additional products to your current pledge amount.

WindPax can be utilized other places not only as a luxury but a backup safety device or for use emergency preparation.  Emergencies:Natural disasters can wreak havoc on local power supply and disable communication which is critical for survival and rescue.  WindPax collapsible wind turbines can be stored for such occasions or simply dropped in by rescue personnel to provide enough energy for communication and small luxuries such as LED lighting.  Camping:Today many hikers and campers rely on electronics devices for navigation, communication and safety.  With a finite battery life each device must be recharged or replaced.  This can be supplemented with a collapsible wind turbine to extend the usage of the devices and reduce the amount of batteries that are required to carry on the expedition.  In extreme cases this could provide a safety net for unexpected accidents or in time of need for communication and rescue.  At home:WindPax can be used around the home to run LED lighting along walkways, within a shed or any other application where a self-sustaining energy is required.   Our TeamWe are a group of talented engineers and designers that have spent many years working and researching in energy related fields, more specifically renewable wind turbine technologies.Founder-Justin R Chambers, BSMESenior Advisor-James E Smith, PhDFinancial Advisor-James E Smith II, CPAElectronics Design-Drew Lowery, PhDAerodynamics Design- Chad Panther, PhDDesigner-Ephraim PittoreWe have partnered up with some great people and organizations.  We have an experienced manufacturer  that is eager to help produce these and several outreach organizations are ready to help us distribute the turbines.  We are working to make more links and partnerships with anyone that is willing to help.  If you or your organisation would like to get involved then please contact us.Please help us by sharing and getting the word out.   We want to make this a successful approach to alleviating energy poverty.  Please visit our website at windpax.com and use the indiegogo share tools and share with us on social media and online.  Thank you for your time and donations and please connect with us with any questions or comments.  We welcome your insights and ideas to help make these devices better and how to better utilize our technology for a greater good.  Justin R Chambers, PresidentNote: All donors that are receiving a WindPax themselves will receive the ""Wisp"" (Clear Windpax wind turbine featured in this description).",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>There are over 60,000 kids living on the streets of Nairobi, Kenya. They have left home for a variety of reasons, anything from being abused to being orphaned to just being very very hungry. For whatever reason they leave home and try to make a better life for themselves living on the streets. Street life is a very hard life. These children give up their childhood in order to survive. They face drug addictions, rape, malnutrition, and violence. Made in the Streets offers hope. Through this program street kids find a supportive and stable environment. They are given an education and skills training and the opportunity to overcome poverty. Most importantly they are shown love. They are shown that they matter. They are shown that they can make a difference in the world.</p>
<p>All of this would not be possible without the Team. The staff at MITS makes daily sacrifices in order to invest in the children that the rest of society has rejected.

If you have suggestions or complaints, please write to info@enverdeworld.com. </p><p> </p><h3><strong>FAQs</strong></h3><p><strong>1. Does it come with seeds and soil?</strong></p><p>Altifarm is a product which simplifies gardening and make it easy for anyone to grow produce at home. The idea is to give you the flexibility to decide what kind of plants you want as per your wish and regional climate. That’s why, we do not provide seeds and soil.</p><p><strong>2. If the goal is not met, will I still get my Altifarm?</strong></p><p>We will process all orders and deliver them regardless of the meeting of the goal. We are already in batch production and higher number of pledges help us scale our production and go to market sooner.</p><p><strong>3. Is there a warranty?</strong></p><p>Altifarm comes with one year warranty against manufacturing defects.</p><p><strong>4. You seem to be in a good shape, why are you doing a crowdfunding campaign?</strong></p><p>Our aim is to start an urban farming movement. To motivate people around the world to eat and live healthy in an easy and fuss-free manner. By gaining initial pre-orders and backers’ support through Indiegogo, we wish to the validate the thought behind Altifarm, which will help us take the product to retail distribution on a larger scale.</p><p>As a backer, you could help us improve the product with realtime user feedback across regions/conditions. We are keen to develop more expansion packs if needed and make Altifarm a comprehensive product platform. As a self-funded start-up, we are appreciative of all the support and funding we can get.</p><p><strong>5. What are the payment options available?</strong></p><p>Indiegogo accepts payment through Credit Cards.</p><p><strong>6. This looks big and my apartment is not! Will it fit?</strong></p><p>Although it has a massive cultivable area, the footprint of Altifarm is comparable to an office chair. Turn an unused corner into a home-farm or a green space and reap the benefits.</p><p><strong>7. What growing medium can we use with Altifarm?</strong></p><p>Use good ole’ garden soil. You may enrich it with home-made compost with food scraps from kitchen. Or go completely soil-less with coco-peat medium, along with added nutrients. Write to us to know more on this or follow our blog for more info.</p><p><strong>8. How much weight can the frame withstand?

Or that food travels for over 1500 miles on an average and has a significant carbon footprint?  Also that the crop varieties in commercial farming are prioritized for shelf life and not for taste and nutrition?When you grow your own food, it's as fresh as it can get. With local produce, your meals are always crisp, juicy and bursting with flavor. There's only the joy, pride and delightful consumption with no chemicals, pesticides or GMO to worry about.Why Altifarm?Although most of us has dabbled with growing plants at some point, we gave up when plants die due to incorrect watering or inadequate nutrition. Others are too busy to take care of plants. Those living in apartments might not have adequate space or sunlight, while climate extremities make it difficult for those in colder regions.Altifarm was designed to take these challenges head-on. Its unique patent-pending design, takes minimal floor space but provides massive grow area and adequate sunlight and air. Inbuilt self-watering system stores water for almost a week and takes care of routine watering without any guess work, letting plants decide how much water they need.Altifarm blends into your home and grows fresh produce, without getting you tied down to intricacies of plant care.

All our production tooling, assembly line and fixtures are ready. As we move into flow production from small batch production, we do anticipate minor difficulties. However, if we hit any major roadblocks or delays in production, we would ensure transparent communication. Likewise, we had done full container shipping(FCL) to Europe in the past and necessary paper work has been sorted out. If we face delays while shipping to newer regions, the same would be duly communicated to backers.Final WordEnverde is a spin-off of Primusdesign, a boutique Product Design studio, with a string of successful projects across multiple domains.  All the past learning from our hundreds of projects of varying magnitudes, along with blessings of our mentors and support of our partners, have helped us pull this project over the last 3 years - from a hobby to an enterprise. In our quest for perfection, we had wiped the slate clean more than once and we believe we gave it our best shot. If you have suggestions or complaints, please write to info@enverdeworld.com.  FAQs1.

<p>ProtoCycler is a new product that allows you to recycle waste plastic into valuable 3D printer filament - safely, quickly, and easily! It comes complete with a built in grinder, intelligent computer control, safety certification, and real time diameter feedback, so anyone can make their own filament hassle free. It also saves you a *TON* of money! Even the cheapest spools are around $30 to buy new, and they can certainly cost much more than that. ProtoCycler lets you make the same 1 kilogram spools for just $5...and if you recycle, your spools are FREE! <br/><br/><br/>This means that ProtoCycler will pay for itself in just 10-20 spools - and as anyone who 3D prints knows, this doesn't take all that long. Never mind all the waste you'll divert from the trash bin. <b>Simply put, if you 3D print, <i>you need ProtoCycler!</i></b><br/></p>

<h3>WHY WE CREATED PROTOCYCLER</h3>
<p>We
want everyone to be able to create whatever they wish, without worrying about the cost or the environment. The design technology
available today is spurring a revolution in how people think, make,
and create. Hacker spaces, Maker Faires, and 3D printers in schools
are all evidence of a growing trend that allows anyone to make
whatever they want, without needing the time or skill required by
traditional manufacturing methods. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1088292/files/20141210230940-Lifestyle.JPG?1418281780"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<p><br/></p>But this technology has so far remained unsustainable. Whether it be the cost of buying new feedstock, or the waste generated as you finalize your design to perfection, true creative freedom is being held back by the consumable nature of the industry. By using ProtoCycler to create filament for your 3D printer from recycled waste or raw pellets, 3D printing becomes both sustainable and affordable. This allows you to unleash your creativity and make what you want, when you want, in any colour you want...for free!<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>HOW IT WORKS</b></h3>
<div>With just the turn of a crank and push of a button, ProtoCycler automatically creates filament at up to 10 feet a minute, at industry leading tolerances, in any colour you like. This filament can be used with any desktop 3D printer to create whatever you want!</div>

<p>ProtoCycler is designed to be the easiest extruder on the market, so it takes care of everything for you. Just select the plastic you want, hit ""start"", and ProtoCycler does the rest! It really is that simple. For the more adventurous, ProtoCycler will let you experiment with your own settings and custom materials, to create pretty much anything you can imagine. ProtoCycler's open source software and all metal hot end means that if your 3D printer can print with it, ProtoCycler can make it! </p>

<h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p>When we first started extruding filament, we used a design similar to the rest of the market. But we were frustrated by the lack of performance, safety, and reliability of those designs - it just took too much time and effort to get usable filament. We ended up having to fundamentally change how filament is extruded to meet our standard for quality - a process that took 2 years iterating through over 10 designs, but was well worth it. Thanks to everything we've learned, ProtoCycler produces beautifully consistent filament, safely and quickly, no matter your skill level.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1081876/files/20141208162835-Extrusion.JPG?1418084915"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<br/>ProtoCycler is the <i>only</i> extruder that uses patent pending MixFlow<b>™</b> technology to ensure you get consistent filament, at a speed and efficiency that puts other desktop units to shame. But ProtoCycler doesn't stop there - it has push-button automated control, distributed spooling, and diameter feedback. With all of this technology included right out of the box, it's easy to see how ProtoCycler is the only option when it comes to filament production - feeding your 3D printer with filament has never been so quick or easy! </div>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We've spent over 2 years on ProtoCycler so far, but we're not done yet. Bringing a product to market, especially one this groundbreaking, takes real time and effort. We want to be fully transparent with you about our plans going forward, so you can be 100% confident in our ability to fulfill your order. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We've already done</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> as much prep work as possible pre-campaign to ensure there won't be any huge changes or delays in the future - this includes attempting UL safety certification before we launch, logging over 1000 hours of testing time, pre-manufacturing some units at our quoted cost, and getting preliminary user feedback...all in the name of being as prepared as we can be!<br/> </span><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1088314/files/20141210233038-20140919_163614__1_.jpg?1418283038"" src="""" style=""""/><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ProtoCycler undergoing Electromagnetic Compatibility testing at UL</i></p>
<br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">But we've taken ProtoCycler as far as we can without knowing just how much demand there will be from you, our customers. Demand fundamentally changes how things are produced, as the most affordable way to make 100 units is different than the most affordable way to make 1000. Time also plays a huge part - we don't want to select a manufacturing method that costs less for 100 units, then find out we have demand for 1000, and take years to fulfill those orders! Therefore, we've held off on the final stages of designing for manufacturing until we know - based on YOUR demand - exactly what the best way to manufacture will be. This allows us to ensure that no matter how many ProtoCycler's are ordered, we'll be able to deliver them as quickly as possible, for the lowest price.</span>

<b><i><div><b><i><br/></i></b></div>Ideation</i></b>
</div>
<div>We first had the idea for ProtoCycler almost 3 years ago, but it wasn't until the fall of 2012 that we really started to test our ideas. No matter what we tried, we just couldn't get plastic to extrude reliably and consistently, until we discovered MixFlow<b>™ </b>in the spring of 2013.<br/><br/><b><i>Prototyping and Product Development</i></b>
</div>
<div>We began to develop ProtoCycler once we'd proven that the concept could work. Over the next 15 months, we prototyped through multiple variations, frequently using our prototypes to recycle themselves into new prototypes! This ""Prototype Recycling"" is what led to the name ProtoCycler, and was an inspiration to see in action. When we were sure our technology worked, we began preparing it for market. This involved optimizing the performance of our extruder, integrating the entire unit into a beautifully designed enclosure, and beginning to account for cost effective manufacturing. Last but not least, we began our certification process with Underwriter Laboratories, so that there wouldn't be any surprises once we launched our campaign. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1088270/files/20141210225035-Prototyping_GIF.gif?1418280635"" src="""" style=""width: 621.341991341991px; height: 463px;""/></p>
<br/><b><i>Indiegogo Campaign</i></b>
</div>
<div>Now that our product is completely ready from a functional point of view, we're asking for your help to make it a reality! We'll be doing everything we can to run an open, honest, and responsive campaign, as your feedback as a backer is invaluable to us - so get involved and help us shape the future of sustainable creation! By supporting our campaign, you're helping us bring ProtoCycler to market successfully, and might even unlock some stretch goals along the way...<br/><br/><b><i>Fulfillment</i></b>
</div>
<div>Once our campaign is successful, we can begin the final stages of design and fulfillment. We're choosing to delay our design finalization until after the campaign for a number of reasons: it gives us time to incorporate your feedback, and design for the most cost effective manufacturing regardless of our sales total. What this means is that we'll be able to deliver ProtoCycler on time and on budget regardless of whether we sell 100, 500, or even 5000 units. We'll also be able to utilize the feedback from a specially chosen group of beta testers, and will be working closely with UL to ensure any final changes remain completely safe. Once everything is set in place, we'll begin our manufacturing and assembly, perform some final quality assurance and testing, prime your ProtoCycler with the plastic of your choice, and ship them off to you!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1088250/files/20141210222720-Fulfilment_GIF.gif?1418279240"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS</h3>
<div> <b>Where can I find details on the stretch goals?</b><br/><i>Right here!<br/><br/></i><p><i>New colours - 100k and every 75k after</i></p>
<p>Don't like the brushed aluminium finish? At 100k, we'll add a new colour option! We'll continue to add a new colour choice for every 75k raised after that - so 2 choices at 100, 3 at 175, 4 at 250...etc etc. We'll ask our backers to vote on which new colours they most want to see.<br/><br/><i>New connectivity - 250k</i></p>
<p>We're pretty excited about this one. If we hit 250k, we get enough of a volume discount to include WiFi with ProtoCycler. Monitor ProtoCycler remotely, have your phone set off an alarm when the spool is finished, pre-heat ProtoCycler on your way into the lab...or just use full manual mode without a pesky USB cable. Will include mobile apps for running ProtoCycler entirely from your phone!<br/><br/><i>New protection - 500k</i><br/><br/>ProtoCycler is already super reliable, but we understand that increased peace of mind can sometimes be invaluable - so at 500k, we'll step up our support network and warranty. We haven't finalized this yet, though, as we want to know what YOU guys want warranty-wise...full replacement after a few months? Unlimited tech support for a few years? a combination of the two? Comment and let us know! <br/><br/><i>New plastics* - ???</i><br/><br/>This one isn't quite ready yet. We want ProtoCycler to support automatic extrusion of as many plastics as possible out of the box - not just ABS and PLA. We really wanted to add this as a stretch goal right now...but we just haven't confirmed fully automatic operation with enough plastics yet, and didn't want to promise something we weren't positive we could deliver on. That being said, we do really want to do this, so we'll be working overtime to try and deliver this before the campaign ends. It will likely be staged similarly to the new colours, but much smaller stages and starting a little later...think Nylon &amp; HIPS at 150k, PET at 175k, HDPE at 200k, LDPE at 225k, etc etc.</p>

<div> <b>How do I pay <i>without</i> PayPal? It says I have to have an account!<br/></b><i>Unfortunately, our previous workaround stopped working pretty quickly. If you want to buy a ProtoCycler but can't use PayPal, e-mail us at info@redetec.com<br/><br/></i>
</div>
<div> <b>What diameter filament will ProtoCycler extrude?</b>
</div>
<div><i>Short answer: 1.75mm, 2.85mm, 3.00mm<br/>Long answer: ProtoCycler has real time diameter feedback that you can easily adjust to any diameter you want, up to 3.00mm. We might end up using separate nozzles for &lt;=2.00mm and &gt;2.00mm extrusion sizes, but as of right now ProtoCycler is user adjustable to extrude any  diameter between 0.1mm and 3.00mm, without a nozzle change.</i></div>
<div>
<br/> <b>Why is it more expensive than some of the other extruders available? Why aren't the parts (Grinder, extruder, etc) sold separately?</b><br/>
</div>
<div><i>We've done an incredible amount of work to ensure we're offering the highest value unit on the market. We are the only extruder available today to come with a grinder and spooler built right in, and the only extruder at all with MixFlow technology and full automation. <br/><br/>By combining the grinder, extruder and spooler in one unit, we're saving costs by eliminating redundant packaging, housings, etc - the savvy shopper will notice it's around $900 to get an extruder, grinder, and spooler individually through our competitors. We firmly believe we're offering the highest quality product on the market, and have done a lot of work to bring the price down to make it the most affordable as well!</i></div>
<p>
<b>Is
it really that simple to use?</b><br/><i>Yes!
In automatic mode, all you have to do is select your plastic, and hit
“go” -ProtoCycler takes care of the rest. Startup, shutdown,
extrusion, and spooling are all automatically controlled, so you get
fantastic filament, every time.</i><br/></p>
<p>
<b>What
does UL Safety Certified mean?</b></p>
<p><i>UL
stands for Underwriters Laboratories, the world leader in safety
certification. We're working with them to ensure ProtoCycler is as
safe as it possibly can be. Unlike other extruders with exposed
heating elements, potentially dangerous wiring, and a lack of thermal
cutoffs, ProtoCycler has been designed from the start with safety in mind. But don't just take our word for it – UL is certifying it!</i><br/>
</p>
<p>
<b>What
colours can I make?</b></p>
<p><i>Any
colour you can think of! Opaque or transparent, bright or subdued,
and even spools that change colour throughout. With ProtoCycler, your
freedom isn't limited by colour selection –create with confidence,
in any colour you like!</i><br/>

is MixFlow<b>™</b> technology?</b></p>
<p><i>MixFlow<b>™</b>
extrusion technology is our patent pending solution to home
extrusion. All of our competitors try to shrink down industrial level
technology, and it just doesn't work as well as it could. We
re-invented extrusion technology from the ground up, and the results
speak for themselves: Smaller footprint, faster extrusion,
drastically improved energy efficiency, and fully automatic control,
are all things made possible by MixFlow<b>™</b> technology!</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>How
long does it take to make a 1kg spool?</b></p>
<p><i>That
depends a little bit on which plastic you're trying to make, but it
should take around 2 hours to extrude 1 kg.</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>What
is distributed spooling, and why do I care?</b></p>
<p><i>Distributed
spooling means that your filament is evenly distributed on a spool,
instead of bunched up in the middle. This ensures tangle free spools
for hassle free printing, every-time.</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>How
is the grinder powered?</b></p>
<p><i>By
you! Our hand crank has been engineered to provide the fastest,
easiest grinding possible. Why not a motor? The main concern is
safety –we just couldn't live with the possibility, however small,
that the grinder could stay powered while your hand got stuck. Hand
cranking ensures the safest experience possible, and also helps to keep
costs as low as we can. </i>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><b> Which plastics can I use?</b></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>Right now, our software supports automatic extrusion of ABS and PLA. However, our hardware can grind and extrude any non-toxic thermoplastic, if you care to venture into manual mode (see below).

<p>
</p>
<p>
<b>What
is full manual mode for / why is the software open source?</b></p>
<p><i>Full
manual mode is for when you want to venture off the beaten path, and
try something totally new. Whether it's extruding a standard plastic
even faster, slowing things way down to feed your 3D printer in real
time, or trying out a brand new type of polymer –manual control
let's do anything you want, even if we don't support it in automatic
mode. Combined with our open source software, you can do literally
anything you want with ProtoCycler. We want to build an active
community that works together to recycle as much plastic as possible,
and full software access is our way of making that happen.
</i></p>
<p>
<b>So
is everything open source?</b></p>
<p><i>No, sadly not. One section of our extruder - the MixFlow tech - is not.

</p>
<p>
<b>Can
I mix plastics?</b></p>
<p style=""font-style: italic;""><i>In

<p><i>Nothing
too bad. We're working on teaching ProtoCycler what it “feels like”
to extrude each different type, so that ultimately it will know if
you've messed up, and fix things on it's own! For now though, one of
two things will happen –the plastic just won't extrude at all if it
needs a higher temperature than the one you've specified, or will come
out significantly degraded if it needed a lower temperature than the
one you've specified. Either way it's an easy fix, and nothing gets

ProtoCycler is a new product that allows you to recycle waste plastic into valuable 3D printer filament - safely, quickly, and easily! It comes complete with a built in grinder, intelligent computer control, safety certification, and real time diameter feedback, so anyone can make their own filament hassle free. It also saves you a *TON* of money! Even the cheapest spools are around $30 to buy new, and they can certainly cost much more than that. ProtoCycler lets you make the same 1 kilogram spools for just $5...and if you recycle, your spools are FREE! This means that ProtoCycler will pay for itself in just 10-20 spools - and as anyone who 3D prints knows, this doesn't take all that long. Never mind all the waste you'll divert from the trash bin. Simply put, if you 3D print, you need ProtoCycler!



WHY WE CREATED PROTOCYCLER
We
want everyone to be able to create whatever they wish, without worrying about the cost or the environment. The design technology
available today is spurring a revolution in how people think, make,
and create. Hacker spaces, Maker Faires, and 3D printers in schools
are all evidence of a growing trend that allows anyone to make
whatever they want, without needing the time or skill required by
traditional manufacturing methods. 


But this technology has so far remained unsustainable. Whether it be the cost of buying new feedstock, or the waste generated as you finalize your design to perfection, true creative freedom is being held back by the consumable nature of the industry. By using ProtoCycler to create filament for your 3D printer from recycled waste or raw pellets, 3D printing becomes both sustainable and affordable. This allows you to unleash your creativity and make what you want, when you want, in any colour you want...for free!
HOW IT WORKS
With just the turn of a crank and push of a button, ProtoCycler automatically creates filament at up to 10 feet a minute, at industry leading tolerances, in any colour you like. This filament can be used with any desktop 3D printer to create whatever you want!

ProtoCycler turns this...




Into this!




And it even spools your filament for you...




ProtoCycler is designed to be the easiest extruder on the market, so it takes care of everything for you. Just select the plastic you want, hit ""start"", and ProtoCycler does the rest! It really is that simple. For the more adventurous, ProtoCycler will let you experiment with your own settings and custom materials, to create pretty much anything you can imagine. ProtoCycler's open source software and all metal hot end means that if your 3D printer can print with it, ProtoCycler can make it! 






FEATURES




 






TECHNOLOGY
When we first started extruding filament, we used a design similar to the rest of the market. But we were frustrated by the lack of performance, safety, and reliability of those designs - it just took too much time and effort to get usable filament. We ended up having to fundamentally change how filament is extruded to meet our standard for quality - a process that took 2 years iterating through over 10 designs, but was well worth it. Thanks to everything we've learned, ProtoCycler produces beautifully consistent filament, safely and quickly, no matter your skill level.



ProtoCycler is the only extruder that uses patent pending MixFlow™ technology to ensure you get consistent filament, at a speed and efficiency that puts other desktop units to shame. But ProtoCycler doesn't stop there - it has push-button automated control, distributed spooling, and diameter feedback. With all of this technology included right out of the box, it's easy to see how ProtoCycler is the only option when it comes to filament production - feeding your 3D printer with filament has never been so quick or easy!

TIMELINE AND LOGISTICS
We've spent over 2 years on ProtoCycler so far, but we're not done yet. Bringing a product to market, especially one this groundbreaking, takes real time and effort. We want to be fully transparent with you about our plans going forward, so you can be 100% confident in our ability to fulfill your order. 
We've already done as much prep work as possible pre-campaign to ensure there won't be any huge changes or delays in the future - this includes attempting UL safety certification before we launch, logging over 1000 hours of testing time, pre-manufacturing some units at our quoted cost, and getting preliminary user feedback...all in the name of being as prepared as we can be! 
ProtoCycler undergoing Electromagnetic Compatibility testing at UL
But we've taken ProtoCycler as far as we can without knowing just how much demand there will be from you, our customers. Demand fundamentally changes how things are produced, as the most affordable way to make 100 units is different than the most affordable way to make 1000. Time also plays a huge part - we don't want to select a manufacturing method that costs less for 100 units, then find out we have demand for 1000, and take years to fulfill those orders! Therefore, we've held off on the final stages of designing for manufacturing until we know - based on YOUR demand - exactly what the best way to manufacture will be. This allows us to ensure that no matter how many ProtoCycler's are ordered, we'll be able to deliver them as quickly as possible, for the lowest price.






Ideation

We first had the idea for ProtoCycler almost 3 years ago, but it wasn't until the fall of 2012 that we really started to test our ideas. No matter what we tried, we just couldn't get plastic to extrude reliably and consistently, until we discovered MixFlow™ in the spring of 2013.Prototyping and Product Development

We began to develop ProtoCycler once we'd proven that the concept could work. Over the next 15 months, we prototyped through multiple variations, frequently using our prototypes to recycle themselves into new prototypes! This ""Prototype Recycling"" is what led to the name ProtoCycler, and was an inspiration to see in action. When we were sure our technology worked, we began preparing it for market. This involved optimizing the performance of our extruder, integrating the entire unit into a beautifully designed enclosure, and beginning to account for cost effective manufacturing. Last but not least, we began our certification process with Underwriter Laboratories, so that there wouldn't be any surprises once we launched our campaign. 


Indiegogo Campaign

Now that our product is completely ready from a functional point of view, we're asking for your help to make it a reality! We'll be doing everything we can to run an open, honest, and responsive campaign, as your feedback as a backer is invaluable to us - so get involved and help us shape the future of sustainable creation! By supporting our campaign, you're helping us bring ProtoCycler to market successfully, and might even unlock some stretch goals along the way...Fulfillment

Once our campaign is successful, we can begin the final stages of design and fulfillment. We're choosing to delay our design finalization until after the campaign for a number of reasons: it gives us time to incorporate your feedback, and design for the most cost effective manufacturing regardless of our sales total. What this means is that we'll be able to deliver ProtoCycler on time and on budget regardless of whether we sell 100, 500, or even 5000 units. We'll also be able to utilize the feedback from a specially chosen group of beta testers, and will be working closely with UL to ensure any final changes remain completely safe. Once everything is set in place, we'll begin our manufacturing and assembly, perform some final quality assurance and testing, prime your ProtoCycler with the plastic of your choice, and ship them off to you!

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
 Where can I find details on the stretch goals?Right here!New colours - 100k and every 75k after
Don't like the brushed aluminium finish? At 100k, we'll add a new colour option! We'll continue to add a new colour choice for every 75k raised after that - so 2 choices at 100, 3 at 175, 4 at 250...etc etc. We'll ask our backers to vote on which new colours they most want to see.New connectivity - 250k
We're pretty excited about this one. If we hit 250k, we get enough of a volume discount to include WiFi with ProtoCycler. Monitor ProtoCycler remotely, have your phone set off an alarm when the spool is finished, pre-heat ProtoCycler on your way into the lab...or just use full manual mode without a pesky USB cable. Will include mobile apps for running ProtoCycler entirely from your phone!New protection - 500kProtoCycler is already super reliable, but we understand that increased peace of mind can sometimes be invaluable - so at 500k, we'll step up our support network and warranty. We haven't finalized this yet, though, as we want to know what YOU guys want warranty-wise...full replacement after a few months? Unlimited tech support for a few years? a combination of the two? Comment and let us know! New plastics* - ???This one isn't quite ready yet. We want ProtoCycler to support automatic extrusion of as many plastics as possible out of the box - not just ABS and PLA. We really wanted to add this as a stretch goal right now...but we just haven't confirmed fully automatic operation with enough plastics yet, and didn't want to promise something we weren't positive we could deliver on. That being said, we do really want to do this, so we'll be working overtime to try and deliver this before the campaign ends. It will likely be staged similarly to the new colours, but much smaller stages and starting a little later...think Nylon & HIPS at 150k, PET at 175k, HDPE at 200k, LDPE at 225k, etc etc.


 How do I pay without PayPal? It says I have to have an account!Unfortunately, our previous workaround stopped working pretty quickly. If you want to buy a ProtoCycler but can't use PayPal, e-mail us at info@redetec.com

 What diameter filament will ProtoCycler extrude?

Short answer: 1.75mm, 2.85mm, 3.00mmLong answer: ProtoCycler has real time diameter feedback that you can easily adjust to any diameter you want, up to 3.00mm. We might end up using separate nozzles for <=2.00mm and >2.00mm extrusion sizes, but as of right now ProtoCycler is user adjustable to extrude any  diameter between 0.1mm and 3.00mm, without a nozzle change.

 Why is it more expensive than some of the other extruders available? Why aren't the parts (Grinder, extruder, etc) sold separately?

We've done an incredible amount of work to ensure we're offering the highest value unit on the market. We are the only extruder available today to come with a grinder and spooler built right in, and the only extruder at all with MixFlow technology and full automation. By combining the grinder, extruder and spooler in one unit, we're saving costs by eliminating redundant packaging, housings, etc - the savvy shopper will notice it's around $900 to get an extruder, grinder, and spooler individually through our competitors. We firmly believe we're offering the highest quality product on the market, and have done a lot of work to bring the price down to make it the most affordable as well!

Is
it really that simple to use?Yes!
In automatic mode, all you have to do is select your plastic, and hit
“go” -ProtoCycler takes care of the rest. Startup, shutdown,
extrusion, and spooling are all automatically controlled, so you get
fantastic filament, every time.

What
does UL Safety Certified mean?
UL
stands for Underwriters Laboratories, the world leader in safety
certification. We're working with them to ensure ProtoCycler is as
safe as it possibly can be. Unlike other extruders with exposed
heating elements, potentially dangerous wiring, and a lack of thermal
cutoffs, ProtoCycler has been designed from the start with safety in mind. But don't just take our word for it – UL is certifying it!


What
colours can I make?
Any
colour you can think of! Opaque or transparent, bright or subdued,
and even spools that change colour throughout. With ProtoCycler, your
freedom isn't limited by colour selection –create with confidence,
in any colour you like!

 How much is international shipping?
It really depends where you live! We're working our hardest to minimize shipping costs to anywhere in the world, and they'll only get lower as more people pledge. If/When we succeed, we'll send out a survey with shipping options to all of our international backers - any additional costs will be dealt with then, when we've gotten the maximum volume and corresponding lowest price. That being said, we're estimating an additional cost between $25 and $75 depending on volumes and where you live. 


is MixFlow™ technology?
MixFlow™
extrusion technology is our patent pending solution to home
extrusion. All of our competitors try to shrink down industrial level

<p>With Future Home you get simple one-touch light control available from any device. In addition to this, settings are available for you to automate the lighting in your house based on brightness and motion. You can for example set Future Home to turn on a light in a room when it detects a presence there, or turn off all lights when there's no presence in your house.</p>

<p>Automatic adjustments of the temperature in your house is a breeze with Future Home. Timers and house-modes are easy to set up and allow you to efficiently utilize the heating equipment you already have installed in your house. As an example, Future Home can be configured to lower the temperature in rooms when you are away at work or sleeping, and can of course be set to heat the rooms back up again for when you come back home or wake up.</p>

<p>All products included in the Future Home packages communicate wirelessly over RF, giving you near unlimited flexibility when it comes to placement. Throw those wires away and join the wireless revolution!</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>Reduced Installation Cost</b></p>
<p>The wireless building can help you save more money than conventional installation solutions as it removes the need for several layers of cables, thus saving time, money and material.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>Maintenance-Free</b></p>
<p>Tired of changing batteries? With Future Home, the components harvest their own energy so batteries are no longer needed. For example, when you press a light switch, the switch will generate enough kinetic energy to send the required signal to turn on or off your lights. Temperature sensors use solar energy as a power supply to report back the temperature in a room (battery powered models are available for rooms without any source of natural light).</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>Security</b></p>
<p>All communication in our system is encrypted using either EnOcean radio networks, secure telegrams or the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption protocol (up to AES 256-bit encryption). This is the same functionality used by banks and popular e-commerce services for secure communication.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>EnOcean Alliance</b></p>
<p>EnOcean Alliance is a consortium of companies developing control systems for sustainable buildings. The EnOcean Alliance has the largest number of installed field-proven wireless building automation networks in the world.</p>

Your support will allow us to initiate tooling and manufacturing of our smart hubs so that we can make smart homes available for everyone.</p>
<p>So why should you support us?</p>
<ul>
<li>You're annoyed by too many remote controls.</li>
<li>You've stopped using your burglar alarm because it's too complicated.</li>
<li>You want to find out why your utility bill is so high and you're interested in ways you can make it smaller.</li>
</ul><h2 style=""margin: 32px 0 24px 0;"">FAQ</h2>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>What’s your referral program like?</b></p>
<p>If you successfully refer 4 friends to pre-order a kit, we will refund the total price of your pre-order if their kits are of equivalent value or larger. We will refund your kit partially if their kits are of lower value.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>What kind of protocols does your Smart Hub support?</b></p>
<p>It has built in support for WiFi, Bluetooth, and EnOcean. However, it also comes with 2 USB ports for future support of other protocols.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>Why the EnOcean protocol?</b></p>
<p>EnOcean products are in use in over 150 000 school, hotels and offices all over the world. It’s a well adopted standard in the industry because of their maintenance-free sensors and switches that utilize energy-harvesting and self-powered technologies. In other words, they don't require any batteries.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>What kind of Smart Products can I automate from the app.</b></p>
<p>Most EnOcean supported products, plugs, actuators, switches, sensors and meters. We are working on support for bluetooth and WiFi enabled products and we're continually adding support for more an more products.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>Which EnOcean brands do you support?</b></p>
<p>Other than the products listed we support products from several other manufacturers. Tested and verified are products from Eltako and Thermokon, but the list is continuously expanded.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>Can I control several “Sites” from one app</b></p>
<p>Yes you can control your home, cabin, boat, caravan, etc. all from the same app and switching is super easy!</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>Can several users control at a time?</b></p>
<p>Yes Future Home supports multiple users, and you can even add people as guests, giving them limited access to your home.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0 0 6px 0;""><b>Do you have a service plan?</b></p>
<p>With the Smart Hub, the app and primary services are free they are accessible from as many devices as you’d like. This means that you can download the free app, control devices in your home, automate products, receive alerts, and stream video from cameras and other sensor data.</p>
<p>After the products ship, there will be optional service plans available that include more data options such as storing of events and data over a longer period of time, statistics and reports. These premium plans will have a surcharge but are optional and contract-free. Updates to the app are free as well.</p>

After working as technicians installing smart homes for years it always annoyed us how the solutions that are available on the market were so unnecessarily complicated, inflexible, outdated and costly. That's why we started Future Home - to make a smart home system that ""just works"" for everyone. With Future Home we wish to empower people to get complete control of all the electronics in their home; all from a single application.
We continuously make sure we keep up with the rapid development of today's smart home technology and make sure we support the latest in smart home electronics such as TVs, home theater systems, etc. We also believe that a smart home should not be accessible from a select few devices and have therefore made sure that the Future Home application is available on any device, be it a smart phone, smart watch, tablet, computer or even glasses.
As featured on:
Features & Benefits





Intelligent Lighting
With Future Home you get simple one-touch light control available from any device. In addition to this, settings are available for you to automate the lighting in your house based on brightness and motion. You can for example set Future Home to turn on a light in a room when it detects a presence there, or turn off all lights when there's no presence in your house.







Climate Control
Automatic adjustments of the temperature in your house is a breeze with Future Home. Timers and house-modes are easy to set up and allow you to efficiently utilize the heating equipment you already have installed in your house. As an example, Future Home can be configured to lower the temperature in rooms when you are away at work or sleeping, and can of course be set to heat the rooms back up again for when you come back home or wake up.







Shading

Annoyed by the sun? Set your blinds or other form of shading to automatically adjust themselves when it's bright outside. You can control everything straight from your phone, so you don't even have to leave your cozy couch to pull the blinds down.







Appliances
Out and about and wish you had a pot of steaming coffee waiting for you when you came home? No worries, open Future Home and turn it on from anywhere. Suddenly realized that you might have left the stove on? Again, Future Home comes to the rescue. Just check the Future Home and turn it off.







Safety and Security
When you're leaving the house you can, with the glance of an eye, check and see if you left a window open and if you remembered to lock all doors. You can even monitor the movements in a room to detect someone's presence.







Power Consumption
Baffled by a high energy bill again? With Future Home you can check the power consumption of every device that's connected to your system and get detailed statistics over the power used. Future Home will also be able to give you warnings and smart notifications related to where you can potentially save power.







And a whole lot more coming
We are currently working hard to add more features and product support and we're already looking into integrations with Sonos, Phillips Hue and Apple's HomeKit. Additional news about this progress will be posted on our blog.

How does it work?
""The Wireless Building""
All products included in the Future Home packages communicate wirelessly over RF, giving you near unlimited flexibility when it comes to placement. Throw those wires away and join the wireless revolution!
Reduced Installation Cost
The wireless building can help you save more money than conventional installation solutions as it removes the need for several layers of cables, thus saving time, money and material.
Maintenance-Free
Tired of changing batteries? With Future Home, the components harvest their own energy so batteries are no longer needed. For example, when you press a light switch, the switch will generate enough kinetic energy to send the required signal to turn on or off your lights. Temperature sensors use solar energy as a power supply to report back the temperature in a room (battery powered models are available for rooms without any source of natural light).
Security
All communication in our system is encrypted using either EnOcean radio networks, secure telegrams or the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption protocol (up to AES 256-bit encryption). This is the same functionality used by banks and popular e-commerce services for secure communication.
EnOcean Alliance
EnOcean Alliance is a consortium of companies developing control systems for sustainable buildings. The EnOcean Alliance has the largest number of installed field-proven wireless building automation networks in the world.
Products





Smart Hub
This is the core of the Future Home smart home system. It makes all components in your home work seamlessly together and enables you to control them from anywhere in the world. Great design, high quality components and user-friendliness were all in focus when creating the Smart Hub.







Smart Plug
Simply put, this smart plug provides you with ""plug-and-play"" control of any appliance, lamp, heater, etc. - anything that can be plugged into a socket. It also offers a complete overview of energy consumption of connected load, meaning you can track just how much power you use making coffee every morning.







Occupancy Sensor

This sensor sends wireless signals when motion is detected, thus enabling you to set up zones where you can be notified of any presence. As with the other components, this sensor also harvests indoor light, making it battery free.







Magnet Contact
Sends wireless signals when a door or window is opened. Combine this with the occupancy sensor and you can detect when someone is inside your house or is entering your house. This sensor also harvests indoor light to power the sensor and wireless communications.







Temperature Sensor
Temperature sensor that accurately senses the temperature in a room. If you did not guess it by now, this sensor also harvests indoor light to power the sensor and wireless communications.







Actuator
This is an in-the-wall mounted actuator that can control lighting or heating, and has the benefit of being hidden from view. In some countries this actuator requires an electrician to install.







Switch
Albeit simple on the outside, this switch contains advanced components that allow it to generate enough kinetic energy to send wireless signals when you press it, effectively removing the need for wires and batteries. It can be set up to control everything in your house, from simple lights to your coffee maker.


The Smart Hub <3 Raspberry Pi
The Future Home Smart Hub is probably the first commercially available smart home gateway utilizing the Raspberry Pi Compute Module. The small form factor, the power of the Raspberry Pi and not to mention the eMMC memory, all makes it the perfect server to run our Debian based, ARM Linux OS and our software packages (written mainly in C++ and modern web code). We strive at making our hardware products just as great as our software, with a constant focus on high quality, high reliability and long product life-cycles.
The Raspberry Pi Compute Module does not only save us from having to ""reinvent the wheel"", but it goes perfectly in line with our wish of making smart homes readily available and easy to aquire by everyone. As one of the key factors here is of course sensible pricing.
Where we are in development
We are currently ready with a working product, and have spent the last year testing it in our own homes, and with a selection of pilot customers. This has provided us with valuable information in terms of where to focus our development process. We're currently in the process of:


Documenting our API
Extending our hardware support
Expanding the app features and optimizing the design

When we're done with the aforementioned tasks, we'll get straight to:



Designing packaging
Getting product certification
Tooling
Production

So why should you support us?

You're annoyed by too many remote controls.
You've stopped using your burglar alarm because it's too complicated.
You want to find out why your utility bill is so high and you're interested in ways you can make it smaller.
FAQ
What’s your referral program like?
If you successfully refer 4 friends to pre-order a kit, we will refund the total price of your pre-order if their kits are of equivalent value or larger. We will refund your kit partially if their kits are of lower value.
What kind of protocols does your Smart Hub support?
It has built in support for WiFi, Bluetooth, and EnOcean. However, it also comes with 2 USB ports for future support of other protocols.
Why the EnOcean protocol?
EnOcean products are in use in over 150 000 school, hotels and offices all over the world. It’s a well adopted standard in the industry because of their maintenance-free sensors and switches that utilize energy-harvesting and self-powered technologies. In other words, they don't require any batteries.
What kind of Smart Products can I automate from the app.
Most EnOcean supported products, plugs, actuators, switches, sensors and meters. We are working on support for bluetooth and WiFi enabled products and we're continually adding support for more an more products.
Which EnOcean brands do you support?
Other than the products listed we support products from several other manufacturers. Tested and verified are products from Eltako and Thermokon, but the list is continuously expanded.
Can I control several “Sites” from one app
Yes you can control your home, cabin, boat, caravan, etc. all from the same app and switching is super easy!
Can several users control at a time?
Yes Future Home supports multiple users, and you can even add people as guests, giving them limited access to your home.
Do you have a service plan?
With the Smart Hub, the app and primary services are free they are accessible from as many devices as you’d like. This means that you can download the free app, control devices in your home, automate products, receive alerts, and stream video from cameras and other sensor data.
After the products ship, there will be optional service plans available that include more data options such as storing of events and data over a longer period of time, statistics and reports. These premium plans will have a surcharge but are optional and contract-free. Updates to the app are free as well.
Will you have an open API?
Yes! We are currently working very hard on documenting our API well in order to make it easier for developers and enthusiasts to contribute with their own ideas.
Disclaimer: We will to the best of our ability try to deliver the products on time, but delivery on time in not guaranteed.Featured In

<p>R&amp;D (Research and Development) started on the Swash 1400 over two years ago, when the Brondell team met with the objective of creating the most advanced, comfortable, and intuitive Swash model we’ve ever offered. </p>
<p>We invested millions of dollars to go through several rounds of design development that incorporated feedback from our large (and vocal!) customer base, and we eventually landed on a model that incorporated both the features that our customers wanted, and the parts sourced specifically to guarantee the high quality of design our customers have come to expect. That model is what you’re reading about on this page – the Swash 1400.</p>

<p>The year was 1990, and Dave Samuel’s high school graduation present was a trip to Japan with his dad. The night before they returned home, Dave excused himself from the table at one of Tokyo’s finest restaurants and made his way to the restroom. Inside he found what looked like a toilet crossed with a computer... it lit up and beeped and had buttons all over it. Being a “techie,” (he was headed to MIT in the fall), Dave immediately started trying to figure out how the thing worked... but he couldn’t read Japanese. That didn’t stop him, though, and the end result was a dousing by the electronic bidet toilet seat. On the way back to the table he had a soaking wet crotch, a bright red face... and an idea. </p>
<div data-id=""14531489""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1484167054/g9vlr8vlyabqdcypxfqs.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the next few years, Dave did a ton of research, and realized that electronic bidet toilet seats had a huge market presence in Japan – almost every business had one, and nearly as many households did too. But bidets were a totally foreign concept in the United States. Americans had long followed Japanese tech trends, however, and Dave banked on them continuing to do so. His main goal became to combine the cutting-edge technology with a sleek modern design that would complement any North American bathroom and be easy for the customer to install. After finding a manufacturer who could make the seat of his dreams, Dave founded Brondell Inc. in 2003. </p>
<div data-id=""14531503""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1484167054/pgegdgnnffv6oteb1wm8.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, here’s where things get interesting. After running into Mark Cuban at a party and pitching him on Brondell’s goals, Dave secured the investment that would put the company on the map. With the backing and guidance of visionaries like Dave Samuel (who sold his company <a href=""http://spinner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">spinner.com</a> to AOL for $320M in 1999), and Mark Cuban (no resume needed there), Brondell Inc. has a track record of using the technology of tomorrow to enrich lives today.</p>

<p>The entire Brondell team is passionate about supplying people with products that enable them to live their healthiest lives. For us, a big part of that means giving people the option to wash themselves clean (instead of wipe themselves dirty) by using a bidet seat. But despite the fact that bidets and bidet seats are hugely popular throughout the world (over 82% of homes in Japan alone have electronic bidets!), they still just haven’t caught on in North America, especially with younger generations. And that’s a shame, because who appreciates awesome technology more than millennials? </p>
<p>Then we realized something: you can’t choose an option you don’t know you have! So we went to work putting together an exciting and informative Indiegogo campaign designed to show people just what their bathrooms (and backsides) were missing. </p>
<div data-id=""14454560""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1484167056/j25dsueodmuykaok0as5.png"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Throughout Brondell’s 14 years in business, we’ve always relied on the feedback from our very passionate customers when making improvements to all of our product lines. We are super excited to engage the Indiegogo community and hear your feedback as we continue to improve and refine our next generation(s) of Swash bidet toilet seats. And most of all, we can’t wait for you to join us in washing, not wiping! </p>

<h2>Common FAQ's</h2>
<p><strong>What is a Swash Luxury Bidet Seat?</strong></p>
<p>Isn’t it obvious?! Ok, maybe not. A Swash is an advanced electronic bidet toilet seat that uses a remote control to position and spray a fresh and hygienic stream of water from stainless steel nozzles when you’re finished using the bathroom. It comes with loads of other cool features, too… just check out our Feature Section!</p>
<p><strong>How does the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat work?</strong></p>
<p>Have a toilet? Awesome – you’re halfway there! Just lose the seat…because the Swash replaces your existing toilet seat. It delivers a warm-water wash through two self-cleaning, positionable nozzles that spray with different temperatures, pressures - all controlled by the included remote. One nozzle’s spray is directed at your behind, and the other is targeted at a more “frontal” position (this is sometimes called the feminine wash). Together they make sure that no spot on your…erm, undercarriage is left unclean. Oh, and the seat’s heated. Cause no one like a cold tushy on a winter night, amiright?</p>
<p><strong>Where is the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat manufactured and serviced?</strong></p>
<p>The Swash bidet seat is manufactured in our existing factory in South Korea. All of Brondell’s products are serviced in San Francisco, CA, USA. (No cable cars are harmed in the servicing of our products).</p>
<p><strong>What is your Warranty policy?</strong></p>
<p>The Swash 1400 comes with a three-year limited warranty.</p>
<p><strong>When will I receive my order?</strong></p>
<p>We expect to ship and deliver orders to our backers by the end of March, 2017 – giving you a whole ‘nother meaning of “spring cleaning!”</p>
<p><strong>How will you ship the product to me and where will this ship from?</strong></p>
<p>Your new best friend….I mean new bidet seat will ship by UPS Ground (US shipments) directly from our warehouse in Effingham, IL and by the best method available for shipments in Canada directly from our Canadian warehouse in Toronto, ON.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat fit my toilet?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! The Swash 1400 comes in both an Elongated and a Round size, and is designed to fit on 98% of residential toilet fixtures in North America.</p>
<p><strong>What size bidet seat do I need?</strong></p>
<p>To determine the size of your toilet, just consult the Toilet Fit Guide. And if you’re still unsure, what’s wrong with you!?</p>
<p>Kidding. If, after measuring your toilet setup while consulting the Toilet Fit Guide, you still can’t determine whether you have an Elongated or Round toilet, give our customer service line a call at (888)542-3355 and we’ll sort you out. Our customer service agents will also be able to help you determine the size of your toilet should measurements prove tricky.</p>
<p><strong>When do I choose my size?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the InDemand campaign, we’ll send a survey to you asking for your shipping address, choice of size (Round or Elongated), and choice of color (White or Biscuit).</p>
<p><strong>What installation is required?</strong></p>
<p>Standard installation is quick and easy. And we’re not just saying that so you’ll buy it, only to be left in the toilet lurch once you get it home. No, we really mean it.</p>
<p>The vast majority of our customers do the installation themselves, without needing to hire a plumber or handyman. Standard installation involves a few simple steps that are shown in the Installation Video in the section above. Please note that a standard grounded outlet is required to power the Swash. (Unless you possess the power of electrokinesis, in which case we want to be your friend).</p>
<p>I have a skirted toilet with no access to the tank or the toilet seat mounting bolts of my toilet.</p>
<p><strong>How do I install the Swash?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start with the good news - The Swash 1400 comes with all of the plumbing and mounting hardware necessary to install the bidet seat on a traditional toilet. Now for the not-so-bad news: your super-fancy modern toilet could pose a couple difficulties during installation, but (probably) nothing you can’t handle!</p>
<p>In these instances, we recommend purchasing our alternate T-valve option, found on the Brondell website. The T-valve will connect at the shut-off valve at the wall, instead of under the toilet tank. If your fixture also only has top-side access to the toilet seat mounting bolts, you will likely need top-mount hardware, which can be found on the Brondell website.</p>
<p>See? Not so bad! Plus, these items can be purchased in advance of the delivery of your new Swash 1400.</p>
<p><strong>What are the plumbing requirements of the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat?</strong></p>
<p>Swash Luxury Bidet Seats are compatible with most residential toilet fixtures in the USA... which means it’ll probably feel right at home on yours. All that’s required to connect your Swash to water is a toilet with a tank or access to a water supply valve at the wall. Keep in mind that wall-mounted toilets require a separate water connection to be installed in order to provide water for your Swash (in this case, hiring a reputable plumber is recommended).</p>
<p>The Swash includes everything that you need to provide fresh water to your bidet utilizing the existing water supply. In the rare case that your water supply line is inflexible, you will need to purchase a flexible water line either online or at any local hardware store to complete the installation (as in many cases, bendy is better).</p>
<p><strong>Do I need an electrical outlet?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. You will need a standard three-prong grounded GFCI outlet. GFCI outlets with an internal safety breaker are common and required in all kitchens and bathrooms. If your outlet is more than three and a half feet from the toilet, all you will need is a grounded extension cord to operate your Swash. (When you choose the right extension cord for your bathroom, it does blend in well, promise).</p>
<p>For those customers interested in installing a new outlet specifically for the Swash, let your licensed electrician know that the optimum location when facing your toilet fixture is to the left side of the fixture underneath the toilet tank. The Swash 1400 operates on a standard 120 volts AC and requires a minimum 15amp circuit.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use this bidet seat outside of North America?</strong></p>
<p>Yes and No. (Best answer ever, right)? CE-certified 220V seats are not part of this campaign, but they will be available for purchase directly from Brondell next year after we launch our 110V version. Due to the complex technology inside the product, you are not able to use our 110V seats with a power converter unless the frequency also matches (60HZ). For this reason, we don’t suggest using the product with any kind of converter.</p>
<p><strong>How much electricity does the bidet use?</strong></p>
<p>The Swash 1400 consumes a maximum draw of 1200 watts (less than an electric kettle!) when heating and spraying water during the bidet functions with all the other functions on the highest settings. When the Swash is not spraying water, but the heated seat is on, power consumption is around 60 watts (about the same as a medium-strength light bulb) and we have an energy-saving Eco Mode to reduce electrical consumption even more.</p>
<p><strong>How much water does this use and isn’t that wasteful?</strong></p>
<p>Actually the Swash uses a very small amount of water – about a tenth of a gallon per use. When you consider that it takes up to 37 gallons of water to produce a roll of toilet paper – you are actually saving water when you use a bidet seat!</p>
<p><strong>How long is the power cord? On which side of the Swash is the power cord?</strong></p>
<p>The power cord is 3.5 feet long, and extends from the left side of the bidet seat when facing the toilet (standing in the “urinal position,” if you will). It is next to the water connection.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Swash compatible with seat elevators or toilet seat risers?</strong></p>
<p>Yup, the Swash is compatible with certain riser styles. You can buy a riser that is for sure compatible with the Swash (complete with all additionally required hardware) on the Brondell website.</p>
<p><strong>What colors are available for the Swash?</strong></p>
<p>The Swash 1400 is available in White and Biscuit (not like the golden, buttery biscuits that sit on Southern tables. Think elegant and understated beige). After ordering your Swash, the email you’ll receive at the end of the InDemand campaign will help you decide which color will best match your existing toilet.</p>
<p><strong>When do I choose my color?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the InDemand campaign, we’ll send a survey to you asking for your shipping address, choice of size (Round versus Elongated), and choice of color (White versus Biscuit).</p>
<p><strong>How do you operate the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat?</strong></p>
<p>You operate the Swash 1400 by using the wireless remote. (Yep, it’s 2016. Your toilet seat has a remote control). The remote comes with a magnetic dock that can mount to a surface using the adhesive on the back of the dock, or with the provided mounting screws.</p>
<p><strong>Can a Swash be used by children, seniors, and people with disabilities?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! Children love using the Swash, and they are wonderful for parents with children who are potty-trained but not yet able to clean themselves. (Parents going through that stage – you know exactly what we mean. And we feel for you). Those who are elderly, or who have limited mobility or other limitations, can especially benefit from using the Swash. It’s no fun having to ask for help to wipe – the Swash lets anyone with mobility issues preserve their bathroom dignity.</p>
<p><strong>Does the seat stay heated at all times?</strong></p>
<p>The heated seat function is controlled by the user. It can be set to one of three temperature settings, or simply turned off (but why would you do that? In the middle of the night, a warm seat is like a cozy butt hug). The Swash 1400 also features an optional Eco Mode, which automatically turns the seat heat down to Low after 10 minutes of inactivity.</p>
<p><strong>What is the duration of the wash?</strong></p>
<p>Pressing the “Rear” or “Front” button on the remote control starts a two-minute wash cycle. Pressing this button once again at any point in that cycle starts the two-minute cycle from the beginning. Pressing the “Stop” button will stop the cycle at any point. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>How long does the warm water last? Forever you say?</strong></p>
<p>The Swash 1400 uses a ceramic-core on-demand heating system which provides ""endless"" warm water washes, unlike tank systems that run out of warm water before you’re ready and give a shocking blast of cold water exactly where you don’t want it. The standard, uninterrupted wash time for either the Front or Rear wash is two minutes, but can be extended by simply pressing the wash button during the cycle (no judgment here if it takes you twenty minutes to get out of the bathroom).</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between “Front” and “Rear” on the Swash remote control?</strong></p>
<p>The Front Wash provides a feminine hygienic cleanse (which our lady customers find particularly useful), while the Rear Wash offers a posterior wash for both men and women (after all, everybody poops!).</p>
<p><strong>Do the nozzles ever ""get in the way?”</strong></p>
<p>No way! The nozzles are only extended during the wash cycle. At all other times they are housed inside the unit and out of the way. As a further safeguard, the wands self-clean themselves with a high-pressure spray of water before and after each use.</p>
<p>For an extra level of hygiene and peace of mind, the Swash 1400 also features on demand nozzle sterilization, which you can activate at the touch of a button.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Swash safe and reliable?</strong></p>
<p>The Brondell Swash is cETL certified for both the US and Canada for electrical safety standards and is also cUPC certified for both the US and Canada for plumbing safety standards.  The Swash 1400 is covered by a limited three-year warranty.</p>
<p>With proper usage, Brondell products will provide years of reliable use. Owners should read and follow all safety precautions in the literature provided with the product. Pretty standard, you know?</p>
<p><strong>What is the weight limit of the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat?</strong></p>
<p>The Swash lid has a weight limit of 270 pounds. The seat has a weight limit of 330 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>What prevents the Swash from spraying water when someone isn’t on the toilet?</strong></p>
<p>The Swash Luxury Bidet Seat will not work unless someone is sitting on it (we did that on purpose). There is a skin conductivity sensor on the seat that detects contact from your skin. Triggering that sensor is what activates the Swash. We kinda figured you didn’t want some bidet newbie playing with the remote and triggering a Bellagio-like fountain in your bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>What maintenance is required?</strong></p>
<p>Swash seats are made of germ-resistant plastic, and can be cleaned with a soft, wet cloth and a mild detergent. For complete cleaning (hey, we all need it from time to time), the Swash 1400 features a quick-release button to separate the seat from the mounting bracket.</p>
<p>Although Swash nozzles are self-cleaning, we recommend that they be cleaned with a soft brush as needed, and that the removable mesh filter be cleaned every 6-8 months and the carbon deodorizer should be replaced once every 6 months.</p>

</div></div>","The ProblemToilet paper. It was invented in 1857, and people are still relying on it to clean up after trips to the bathroom. That is to say, dry, nonabsorbent paper is supposed to clean up some of the worst messes your body can create. And to make things worse, you have to use your bare hand to assist in the operation, smearing it back and forth until you think you’re clean. It’s barbaric. And what’s worse, a lot of the time it doesn’t even work that well.And the craziest part about it all – you wash your hands after you’re done pooping, right? Why aren’t you washing the thing that actually created the mess in the first place???   The SolutionThe team here at Brondell believes in washing, not wiping. That’s why we’re working on bringing YOU the  the latest version of the Brondell intelligent bidet toilet seat: the Swash 1400.

You’ll begin your cleansing process using a remote to control stainless-steel nozzles and spray warm water just where you need it, and finish up with a warm-air blow dryer to make sure you’re ready to continue on with your day. Of course, a lot happens in between, too...just watch the Product Feature Video below to find out what! 


 

 

 

Dual Stainless Steel Nozzles 
Stainless-steel is proven to be more hygienic and longer-lasting than industry standard plastic. Both nozzles are adjustable and positionable in order to hit you “just right”. The oscillation feature gently moves the nozzle back and forth, while on-demand sterilization ensures that your nozzles remain clean and germ-free.

 
Ceramic-Core Water Heating System
No need to wait for warm water to finish your business. When you’re ready, the Swash 1400 is ready for you and “on-demand” heating means you’ll never run out of warm water again!

 
Fully Customizable Wash Settings
Personalize water temperature, water pressure, and even the spray width to your own preferences and retain them with 2 programmable profile settings.

 
Warm Air Dryer
The heated air dryer with adjustable temperature eliminates the use of toilet paper, ensuring you carry on clean, refreshed, and dry.

 
Replaceable Deodorizer
The easy-to-replace 6-month active carbon deodorizer ensures that all bad odors and smells are neutralized at the source, leaving your bathroom fresh and clean.
 

Gentle-Closing, ""Sittable"" Lid
No matter how hard you try, the gentle-closing lid quietly shuts for a “slam-free” household and, unlike inferior products, our lid is fully “sittable” up to 330 pounds. 

 
 

 

The Swash is easily installed on your existing toilet – no plumber or handyman needed! Check out the Installation Video below to learn how easy it is to turn your boring old toilet into your personal cleansing throne. 



 

 

 

 

 

R&D (Research and Development) started on the Swash 1400 over two years ago, when the Brondell team met with the objective of creating the most advanced, comfortable, and intuitive Swash model we’ve ever offered. 
We invested millions of dollars to go through several rounds of design development that incorporated feedback from our large (and vocal!) customer base, and we eventually landed on a model that incorporated both the features that our customers wanted, and the parts sourced specifically to guarantee the high quality of design our customers have come to expect. That model is what you’re reading about on this page – the Swash 1400.

Based in San Francisco, California, Brondell is the innovative industry leader in health and wellness products. We currently sell the Swash line of advanced bidet toilet seats, the LumaWarm heated nightlight toilet seat, the Spa suite of entry-level bidet products, the H2O+ line of water filtration systems, and the O2+ line of air purification systems. 
All of our offerings reflect Brondell's commitment to a unique blend of the latest technology and modern design, with a focus on allowing our customers to create healthy homes one room at a time. 

The year was 1990, and Dave Samuel’s high school graduation present was a trip to Japan with his dad. The night before they returned home, Dave excused himself from the table at one of Tokyo’s finest restaurants and made his way to the restroom. Inside he found what looked like a toilet crossed with a computer... it lit up and beeped and had buttons all over it. Being a “techie,” (he was headed to MIT in the fall), Dave immediately started trying to figure out how the thing worked... but he couldn’t read Japanese. That didn’t stop him, though, and the end result was a dousing by the electronic bidet toilet seat. On the way back to the table he had a soaking wet crotch, a bright red face... and an idea. 

 
Over the next few years, Dave did a ton of research, and realized that electronic bidet toilet seats had a huge market presence in Japan – almost every business had one, and nearly as many households did too. But bidets were a totally foreign concept in the United States. Americans had long followed Japanese tech trends, however, and Dave banked on them continuing to do so. His main goal became to combine the cutting-edge technology with a sleek modern design that would complement any North American bathroom and be easy for the customer to install. After finding a manufacturer who could make the seat of his dreams, Dave founded Brondell Inc. in 2003. 

 
Now, here’s where things get interesting. After running into Mark Cuban at a party and pitching him on Brondell’s goals, Dave secured the investment that would put the company on the map. With the backing and guidance of visionaries like Dave Samuel (who sold his company spinner.com to AOL for $320M in 1999), and Mark Cuban (no resume needed there), Brondell Inc. has a track record of using the technology of tomorrow to enrich lives today.
 

 

 

The entire Brondell team is passionate about supplying people with products that enable them to live their healthiest lives. For us, a big part of that means giving people the option to wash themselves clean (instead of wipe themselves dirty) by using a bidet seat. But despite the fact that bidets and bidet seats are hugely popular throughout the world (over 82% of homes in Japan alone have electronic bidets!), they still just haven’t caught on in North America, especially with younger generations. And that’s a shame, because who appreciates awesome technology more than millennials? 
Then we realized something: you can’t choose an option you don’t know you have! So we went to work putting together an exciting and informative Indiegogo campaign designed to show people just what their bathrooms (and backsides) were missing. 

Throughout Brondell’s 14 years in business, we’ve always relied on the feedback from our very passionate customers when making improvements to all of our product lines. We are super excited to engage the Indiegogo community and hear your feedback as we continue to improve and refine our next generation(s) of Swash bidet toilet seats. And most of all, we can’t wait for you to join us in washing, not wiping! 

At Brondell, we strive to achieve “clean” in all its forms. We believe in clean bodies, clean homes, and a clean environment, and we’re committed to doing our part to make those things happen. From donating bidet seats to disabled veterans through the “T-Shirts for Troops” organization, to planting trees via Trees for the Future, to donating funds to water.org to secure clean water and healthy sanitation for those lacking such basic fundamental rights, here at Brondell we’re passionate about improving the way people live their lives. It’s our most important work.

Common FAQ's
What is a Swash Luxury Bidet Seat?
Isn’t it obvious?! Ok, maybe not. A Swash is an advanced electronic bidet toilet seat that uses a remote control to position and spray a fresh and hygienic stream of water from stainless steel nozzles when you’re finished using the bathroom. It comes with loads of other cool features, too… just check out our Feature Section!
How does the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat work?
Have a toilet? Awesome – you’re halfway there! Just lose the seat…because the Swash replaces your existing toilet seat. It delivers a warm-water wash through two self-cleaning, positionable nozzles that spray with different temperatures, pressures - all controlled by the included remote. One nozzle’s spray is directed at your behind, and the other is targeted at a more “frontal” position (this is sometimes called the feminine wash). Together they make sure that no spot on your…erm, undercarriage is left unclean. Oh, and the seat’s heated. Cause no one like a cold tushy on a winter night, amiright?
Where is the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat manufactured and serviced?
The Swash bidet seat is manufactured in our existing factory in South Korea. All of Brondell’s products are serviced in San Francisco, CA, USA. (No cable cars are harmed in the servicing of our products).
What is your Warranty policy?
The Swash 1400 comes with a three-year limited warranty.
When will I receive my order?
We expect to ship and deliver orders to our backers by the end of March, 2017 – giving you a whole ‘nother meaning of “spring cleaning!”
How will you ship the product to me and where will this ship from?
Your new best friend….I mean new bidet seat will ship by UPS Ground (US shipments) directly from our warehouse in Effingham, IL and by the best method available for shipments in Canada directly from our Canadian warehouse in Toronto, ON.
Will the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat fit my toilet?
Absolutely! The Swash 1400 comes in both an Elongated and a Round size, and is designed to fit on 98% of residential toilet fixtures in North America.
What size bidet seat do I need?
To determine the size of your toilet, just consult the Toilet Fit Guide. And if you’re still unsure, what’s wrong with you!?
Kidding. If, after measuring your toilet setup while consulting the Toilet Fit Guide, you still can’t determine whether you have an Elongated or Round toilet, give our customer service line a call at (888)542-3355 and we’ll sort you out. Our customer service agents will also be able to help you determine the size of your toilet should measurements prove tricky.
When do I choose my size?
At the end of the InDemand campaign, we’ll send a survey to you asking for your shipping address, choice of size (Round or Elongated), and choice of color (White or Biscuit).
What installation is required?
Standard installation is quick and easy. And we’re not just saying that so you’ll buy it, only to be left in the toilet lurch once you get it home. No, we really mean it.
The vast majority of our customers do the installation themselves, without needing to hire a plumber or handyman. Standard installation involves a few simple steps that are shown in the Installation Video in the section above. Please note that a standard grounded outlet is required to power the Swash. (Unless you possess the power of electrokinesis, in which case we want to be your friend).
I have a skirted toilet with no access to the tank or the toilet seat mounting bolts of my toilet.
How do I install the Swash?
Let’s start with the good news - The Swash 1400 comes with all of the plumbing and mounting hardware necessary to install the bidet seat on a traditional toilet. Now for the not-so-bad news: your super-fancy modern toilet could pose a couple difficulties during installation, but (probably) nothing you can’t handle!
In these instances, we recommend purchasing our alternate T-valve option, found on the Brondell website. The T-valve will connect at the shut-off valve at the wall, instead of under the toilet tank. If your fixture also only has top-side access to the toilet seat mounting bolts, you will likely need top-mount hardware, which can be found on the Brondell website.
See? Not so bad! Plus, these items can be purchased in advance of the delivery of your new Swash 1400.
What are the plumbing requirements of the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat?
Swash Luxury Bidet Seats are compatible with most residential toilet fixtures in the USA... which means it’ll probably feel right at home on yours. All that’s required to connect your Swash to water is a toilet with a tank or access to a water supply valve at the wall. Keep in mind that wall-mounted toilets require a separate water connection to be installed in order to provide water for your Swash (in this case, hiring a reputable plumber is recommended).
The Swash includes everything that you need to provide fresh water to your bidet utilizing the existing water supply. In the rare case that your water supply line is inflexible, you will need to purchase a flexible water line either online or at any local hardware store to complete the installation (as in many cases, bendy is better).
Do I need an electrical outlet?
Yes. You will need a standard three-prong grounded GFCI outlet. GFCI outlets with an internal safety breaker are common and required in all kitchens and bathrooms. If your outlet is more than three and a half feet from the toilet, all you will need is a grounded extension cord to operate your Swash. (When you choose the right extension cord for your bathroom, it does blend in well, promise).
For those customers interested in installing a new outlet specifically for the Swash, let your licensed electrician know that the optimum location when facing your toilet fixture is to the left side of the fixture underneath the toilet tank. The Swash 1400 operates on a standard 120 volts AC and requires a minimum 15amp circuit.
Can I use this bidet seat outside of North America?
Yes and No. (Best answer ever, right)? CE-certified 220V seats are not part of this campaign, but they will be available for purchase directly from Brondell next year after we launch our 110V version. Due to the complex technology inside the product, you are not able to use our 110V seats with a power converter unless the frequency also matches (60HZ). For this reason, we don’t suggest using the product with any kind of converter.
How much electricity does the bidet use?
The Swash 1400 consumes a maximum draw of 1200 watts (less than an electric kettle!) when heating and spraying water during the bidet functions with all the other functions on the highest settings. When the Swash is not spraying water, but the heated seat is on, power consumption is around 60 watts (about the same as a medium-strength light bulb) and we have an energy-saving Eco Mode to reduce electrical consumption even more.
How much water does this use and isn’t that wasteful?
Actually the Swash uses a very small amount of water – about a tenth of a gallon per use. When you consider that it takes up to 37 gallons of water to produce a roll of toilet paper – you are actually saving water when you use a bidet seat!
How long is the power cord? On which side of the Swash is the power cord?
The power cord is 3.5 feet long, and extends from the left side of the bidet seat when facing the toilet (standing in the “urinal position,” if you will). It is next to the water connection.
Is the Swash compatible with seat elevators or toilet seat risers?
Yup, the Swash is compatible with certain riser styles. You can buy a riser that is for sure compatible with the Swash (complete with all additionally required hardware) on the Brondell website.
What colors are available for the Swash?
The Swash 1400 is available in White and Biscuit (not like the golden, buttery biscuits that sit on Southern tables. Think elegant and understated beige). After ordering your Swash, the email you’ll receive at the end of the InDemand campaign will help you decide which color will best match your existing toilet.
When do I choose my color?
At the end of the InDemand campaign, we’ll send a survey to you asking for your shipping address, choice of size (Round versus Elongated), and choice of color (White versus Biscuit).
How do you operate the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat?
You operate the Swash 1400 by using the wireless remote. (Yep, it’s 2016. Your toilet seat has a remote control). The remote comes with a magnetic dock that can mount to a surface using the adhesive on the back of the dock, or with the provided mounting screws.
Can a Swash be used by children, seniors, and people with disabilities?
Absolutely! Children love using the Swash, and they are wonderful for parents with children who are potty-trained but not yet able to clean themselves. (Parents going through that stage – you know exactly what we mean. And we feel for you). Those who are elderly, or who have limited mobility or other limitations, can especially benefit from using the Swash. It’s no fun having to ask for help to wipe – the Swash lets anyone with mobility issues preserve their bathroom dignity.
Does the seat stay heated at all times?
The heated seat function is controlled by the user. It can be set to one of three temperature settings, or simply turned off (but why would you do that? In the middle of the night, a warm seat is like a cozy butt hug). The Swash 1400 also features an optional Eco Mode, which automatically turns the seat heat down to Low after 10 minutes of inactivity.
What is the duration of the wash?
Pressing the “Rear” or “Front” button on the remote control starts a two-minute wash cycle. Pressing this button once again at any point in that cycle starts the two-minute cycle from the beginning. Pressing the “Stop” button will stop the cycle at any point. Any questions?
How long does the warm water last? Forever you say?
The Swash 1400 uses a ceramic-core on-demand heating system which provides ""endless"" warm water washes, unlike tank systems that run out of warm water before you’re ready and give a shocking blast of cold water exactly where you don’t want it. The standard, uninterrupted wash time for either the Front or Rear wash is two minutes, but can be extended by simply pressing the wash button during the cycle (no judgment here if it takes you twenty minutes to get out of the bathroom).
What is the difference between “Front” and “Rear” on the Swash remote control?
The Front Wash provides a feminine hygienic cleanse (which our lady customers find particularly useful), while the Rear Wash offers a posterior wash for both men and women (after all, everybody poops!).
Do the nozzles ever ""get in the way?”
No way! The nozzles are only extended during the wash cycle. At all other times they are housed inside the unit and out of the way. As a further safeguard, the wands self-clean themselves with a high-pressure spray of water before and after each use.
For an extra level of hygiene and peace of mind, the Swash 1400 also features on demand nozzle sterilization, which you can activate at the touch of a button.
Is the Swash safe and reliable?
The Brondell Swash is cETL certified for both the US and Canada for electrical safety standards and is also cUPC certified for both the US and Canada for plumbing safety standards.  The Swash 1400 is covered by a limited three-year warranty.
With proper usage, Brondell products will provide years of reliable use. Owners should read and follow all safety precautions in the literature provided with the product. Pretty standard, you know?
What is the weight limit of the Swash Luxury Bidet Seat?
The Swash lid has a weight limit of 270 pounds. The seat has a weight limit of 330 pounds.
What prevents the Swash from spraying water when someone isn’t on the toilet?
The Swash Luxury Bidet Seat will not work unless someone is sitting on it (we did that on purpose). There is a skin conductivity sensor on the seat that detects contact from your skin. Triggering that sensor is what activates the Swash. We kinda figured you didn’t want some bidet newbie playing with the remote and triggering a Bellagio-like fountain in your bathroom.
What maintenance is required?
Swash seats are made of germ-resistant plastic, and can be cleaned with a soft, wet cloth and a mild detergent. For complete cleaning (hey, we all need it from time to time), the Swash 1400 features a quick-release button to separate the seat from the mounting bracket.
Although Swash nozzles are self-cleaning, we recommend that they be cleaned with a soft brush as needed, and that the removable mesh filter be cleaned every 6-8 months and the carbon deodorizer should be replaced once every 6 months.",47.0,2,"1 Campaign

Your classic pillows - sometimes they’re comfortable, sometimes they aren’t and they get harder over time and do not support your neck properly. And also your memory foam pillows, they’re not very comfortable and retain heat, causing unbearbly hot sleeping conditions.Wopilo will revolutionize your nights by offering the comfort of a traditional pillow, the neck support of an ergonomic one while letting you choose your desired comfort level, firm or fluffy!A SIMPLE CONCEPTWith a unique design that combines the best of a comfortable pillow and memory foam, Wopilo was developed with the help of an osteopathic expert, specialized in pain.A SUPER COMFORTABLE, LATEST GENERATION MICROFIBERS PILLOWJust 0.8 decitex in diameter (the thinnest on the market), our microfibers provide the same feeling and comfort as down feathers (without allergies and the savage process of feather removal). Soft, enveloping material, it’s the highest quality synthetic packing on the market. We also preferred the down microfiber for its versatility, strength and easy maintenance.LATEST GENERATION MEMORY FOAM COREWopilo’s core is made of the best memory foam currently available on the market. Certified Oekotex foam with a density of 40kg / m3 and firmness of 2.0Pa / kg will relax tense muscles and perfectly supports your neck.The Wopilo core is not thermo-sensitive, unlike traditional polyurethane foams that tend to be firmer when the room is cooler and softer when the room is warm.Our memory foam maintains the same level of firmness, no matter what temperature the room is. Your neck will be sure to thank us! Even better, it won’t retain body heat and prevents sweating. Another added bonus is that it has a longer lifetime than conventional foams.CHOOSE YOUR COMFORT WITH ITS TWO DIFFERENT POCKETSYou can choose your side, firm or fluffy! Wopilo adapts to the sensitivity of your neck, it has one pocket with 200 grams of microfibers and another with 450 grams so that you can choose:
a softer comfort if you sleep on the thickest pocket
a firmer comfort if you sleep on the thinnest pocket
ALL YOU COULD EVER WANT FROM A PILLOW... AND MORESHARE WOPILOFollow us on social networks and if you know someone who loves to sleep, tell them about Wopilo!Wopilo was developed with the help of an osteopathic specialist, keenly aware of how important a pillow is for back and neck health, as well as for sleep quality. From a medical point of view, your pillow needs to fulfill two roles while you sleep.The first is to provide proper neck support when you are lying down to prevent the development of neck problems including cervicalgia, cervical lordosis, curvature inversion or even scoliosis. This also helps reduce symptoms (which can be very painful and therefore prevent you from sleeping) of many neck and back disorders such as cervical sprain, torticolis, herniated discs and cervical spondylosis.The second role is to allow the sleeper to be comfortable in a position that is sufficiently relaxing so that they produce serotonin, the well-being hormone that will trigger the release of melatonin, the sleeping hormone…By design, Wopilo fulfills both roles perfectly. As icing on the cake, Wopilo encourages sleepers to position themselves either on their side or on their back, the two most restorative positions you can sleep in.A suitable pillow should allow for proper vertebrae alignment and release pressure points on your neck. The majority of the American population is aware that having a good pillow is vital (more than 60% of the population).USING WOPILOWopilo adapts to your personal desired comfort level. To ensure you are properly using Wopilo and to benefit from optimal neck support from the memory foam core, the Wopilo tag should always be located at the top of your pillow and the core under your neck. Wopilo is the story of Thomas, 32, a poor sleeper who was regularly afflicted with morning neck pain.Thomas came up with a solution simply because he could not find the ideal pillow. He found himself constantly folding traditional pillows, which resulted in a sore neck, and he simply could not sleep on the ergonomic ones. With the help of an osteopathic disorders specialist, he worked for months on the design and selection of materials. This is how Wopilo was born.“Pillows are associated with comfort, yet paradoxically, they are the reason behind so many different aches and pains, especially for the neck.

<p>Cats have always been adorable, loving companions. They are smart, agile, and noble, bringing endless joy to people.</p>
<p>However, our fluffy friends only show the happy side of their lives and don’t express when they are feeling discomfort or in poor health. That is because their wild feline instinct makes them conceal their own illness for self-protection. This often leads to a situation where owners only realize kitties’ sickness when it’s too late for proper care.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a great deal of information about the health condition of a cat can be determined by their weight and litter box behavior. By monitoring and tracking subtle changes in weight and excretion, we are able to know much about the health and wellbeing of our beloved pets.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598353754/d9dnfohm2z39moieajdw.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598353799/qdd3fa1bgl35t5bgdfat.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>Measuring a cat’s weight manually and observing litter box behavior is difficult and impractical.

</div></div>","Cats have always been adorable, loving companions. They are smart, agile, and noble, bringing endless joy to people.
However, our fluffy friends only show the happy side of their lives and don’t express when they are feeling discomfort or in poor health. That is because their wild feline instinct makes them conceal their own illness for self-protection. This often leads to a situation where owners only realize kitties’ sickness when it’s too late for proper care.
Fortunately, a great deal of information about the health condition of a cat can be determined by their weight and litter box behavior. By monitoring and tracking subtle changes in weight and excretion, we are able to know much about the health and wellbeing of our beloved pets.Measuring a cat’s weight manually and observing litter box behavior is difficult and impractical. Also, the collected data and statistics require careful analysis. Now there is a better way. WeCare allows you to understand the physical condition of your cats in an effortless way, so that they live healthier, happier, longer lives.
Accurate Weight Measurement at Each Litter Box Visit
Weighing your cat has never been so easy! With the litter box sitting on WeCare, your cat’s weight will be instantly and accurately collected and shown on the screen while simultaneously uploaded to the app database. You don’t need to hold your cat while you step on a scale anymore!
Keep An Eye On Litter Box Behavior
Litter box behavior matters! WeCare records the time, duration, and frequency of visits when your cat is doing his or her own business. It’s of vital importance to monitor this data to know if any potential health issues are indicated.
The data collected will be uploaded to the App on your smartphone automatically. Meanwhile, the fluctuation of key metrics will be shown in statistical charts and diagrams so that you can see in an instant any change in your cat’s condition. You can even follow along in your furry friend’s growth year by year!
 WeCare reminds you with alerts when shifts of your cat’s health data occur. This can be helpful to prevent disease ahead of time, saving expensive veterinary costs. WeCare provides real-time care for your lovely cuddly mates, so that you know you are giving them the very best care.
Recognizes Multiple Cats
WeCare is ideal for multi-cat homes because it can recognize different cats in your family via its highly-precise sensor. Each cat’s health condition can be monitored and tracked separately.
Stretchable Sides Fit All Litter Boxes
No matter if your cat has a huge automatic litter box or the classic tray, the stretchable sides of WeCare allow you to put any size litter box on top of it.

<p>IT WAS GREAT PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE THIS PROJECT.</p>
<p>BEST REGARDS AND HAVE WONDERFUL DAY!</p>
</div>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</div>
</div></div>","ACPV is the prototype project of Advanced Concentrated Photovoltaic system. This alternative energy generation system  provides clean, effective
and cheap energy solution.


The system has a self-developed controller and algorithm. With
sensors set, auto cooling module, insolation concentration mirrors and solar
tracking system combined together, the ACPV System provides ultra–high electricity
generation efficiency that brings several times more power during the operation year.






The cubic concrete bases are underground, each base is around one cubic meter. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The most advanced SunPower Inc. Maxeon technology solar panel had been used.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During project's construction time , controller
development, sensors calibration, writing program code, making many tests
and analyzing operational algorithms, I
 can say finally that
this is every perspective project ! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~





BASICS 

Available Solar Energy



The actual power reaching the ground generally daily averages less than
200 Watts per square meter. Thus the average power intercepted at any time by
the earth's surface is around 127.4 x 106 x 106 x 200 = 25.4 x 1015 Watts or 25,400 TeraWatts.
To put this
into perspective, the total annual electrical energy consumed in the world from all sources in 2011 was 22,126 TWh (International
Energy Agency (IEA)). 

Today, the average conversion efficiency of major solar panels is
between 15%  to 20%. The SunPower X21-345 W Solar Panel  using their unique Maxeon ® Solar Cell Technology
and Panel’s surface glass geometry provides best, 21.5 % performance efficiency
at standard test conditions: 1000 W/m² irradiance, AM 1.5, 25° C).


Physical behavior

The DC circuit
current  (I) is directly related to
the number of photons absorbed by the panel’s semiconducting material and is
thus proportional to light intensity. The conversion
efficiency is therefore reasonably constant so that the power output is
proportional to the irradiance, however the efficiency is reduced if the cell
temperature is allowed to rise. The DC circuit voltage
(V) varies only slightly with light intensity. Typically, PV cell power output reduces by about 0.5% (!) with every degree Celsius increase in temperature.


According to any panel’s physical behavior, the maximum energy generation occurs if the two main requirements exist: 
The panel’s surface absorb as much perpendicular solar irradiation as
possible and the panel’s temperature is low.
The maximum energy generation is what the ACPV project is deal with !

ACPV CORE

How it works





Self-constructed
controller with sensors set and self-developed program code with system’s
operational Algorithm, alongside autonomic solar tracking module provide
maximum energy generation requirements.

Rising up solar panels insolation (Concentration
Mirrors), real time, perpendicular solar
irradiance tracking (Tracking controller, Sensor and Actuator motor), Solar Panel's parameters state sensing: DC Voltage (V-Volts) , DC Current (I-Amp)
and Temperature (C), environment temperature and non-concentrated light level
 (W/m2).
According to the
sensors parameters, controller analyzes the system’s status and “knows” (Algorithm)
when and how cooling module (Water Pump and Ventilators) has to be switched
on / off (via Relayed Power Cords) for reasonable time period keeping minimal
(Ventilators spent energy, Nozzles and Master Unit / 1.5 bar) resources loss. The
most direct data logging made with manufacturers’ calibrated and certified
Agilent devices and PC, the parallel data logging and analyze made by
controller’s connected terminal logging (PComm ) PC.



AS RESULT THE ACPV SYSTEM PROVIDES  SEVERAL TIMES MORE ENERGY AND FAST INVESTMENT RETURN.































LOCAL 
To make more improvements and
optimization of exist ACPV Research prototype, creating of:
1. Auto cleaning component module.
Removing the dust from solar
panel’s surface will rise the energy generation during the year.
2. PAN – Private Area Network component module.
Wireless - Wi-Fi ZigBee based  network for
project’s sensors, relays and controller’s data exchange and operation.
3. GSM controller’s connectivity module, alongside
with SMA – SannyBoy       solution. 
4. Mobile Service Application.
5. Trying explore system operation with other solar panels such as Bosch, LG, Panasonic.

As result
of above, creating of one big, industrial, certified, mass production ready
ACPV energy booster.


GLOBAL

The Global
Goals are same as significant benefits above, some more are present also. 
I suppose
that with this project’s success and making this idea and system open source,
widely common will cause to: 
1. Alternative energy popularization,
better agenda will help to other entrepreneur to success with their projects.
2. More qualified working places for
system’s manufacturing, maintains and service.
3. Cheaper energy to everyone in
industrial and private sector will slow down the financial crisis, will boost
the economic grow and consumption.
4. Most important, even partly lack
of energy raw materials import / purchase, as gas and coal, will produce
budgets redistribution, those yearly growing energy profits can reduce budgets
debts, improve education and medicine.



I hope and believe that with our success you electricity bill be lower and lower every month as soon as fast as ACPV system entering market widely.






First, drawings, electrical schemes, controllers  and concepts have been changed on the fly during project implementation.








Friends, Please HELP to reach the goals.
Please make some noise about my project's campaign.

Please share it!

<h2>When It Comes to Risk, Experience is Everything</h2>
<p>This is our fifth crowdfunding campaign. We delivered on our first campaign late, which was painful experience, but we learned a ton. Since then we've delivered every campaign early or on time.</p>
<p>With that said, like with any project, there is risk in bringing a new product into the world. It is possible that our reliance on supplier and manufacturing vendors could result in unforeseen delays. Here's what we've done to mitigate risk for our backers:</p>
<ol>
<li>We conducted 10 months of R&amp;D prior to campaign launch to determine the ideal paper formulation for optimal writing and erasing </li>
<li>We received a large run of prototypes in August 2017 and are currently testing and socializing the product</li>
<li>We have chosen raw material providers and finalized all quotes for our next production run</li>
<li>We already work with a trusted packing and shipping provider that fulfills orders for our current product line; this outfit will fulfill orders for the Rocketbook Color notebook.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>CUSTOMS &amp; DUTIES INFORMATION - FOR INTERNATIONAL ORDERS</strong></p>
<p>We cannot mark as gift, this is illegal so we will not be able to do this.</p>
<p>Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.</p>
<p>As many of you know, our terms of sale are CIF destination. This means that we pay all freight, but none of the duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Indiegogo.</p>
<p>As many of you know, Canadian Customs are very strict on products imported into Canada. All products over Canadian $25 are subject to duties and GST or Vat tax. Our invoices are in U.S. dollars, and being converted to Canadian dollars for purpose of duties and taxes, by Canadian Customs.</p>
<p>Here's a link to find the CBSA offices where you can actually go and do the clearance, and save some significant dollars:</p>

We conducted 10 months of R&D prior to campaign launch to determine the ideal paper formulation for optimal writing and erasing 
We received a large run of prototypes in August 2017 and are currently testing and socializing the product
We have chosen raw material providers and finalized all quotes for our next production run
We already work with a trusted packing and shipping provider that fulfills orders for our current product line; this outfit will fulfill orders for the Rocketbook Color notebook.

CUSTOMS & DUTIES INFORMATION - FOR INTERNATIONAL ORDERS
We cannot mark as gift, this is illegal so we will not be able to do this.
Our prices do not include VAT, GST or other country taxes.
As many of you know, our terms of sale are CIF destination. This means that we pay all freight, but none of the duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Indiegogo.
As many of you know, Canadian Customs are very strict on products imported into Canada. All products over Canadian $25 are subject to duties and GST or Vat tax. Our invoices are in U.S. dollars, and being converted to Canadian dollars for purpose of duties and taxes, by Canadian Customs.
Here's a link to find the CBSA offices where you can actually go and do the clearance, and save some significant dollars:

<p>We’re redefining the way people press coffee. We’ve come this far with an incredibly small team and a boot-strapped budget, and we are committed to making simpli press a success. We talked to various manufacturers and created our first prototype in February 2015. We got the second prototype September 2015, where we put it through arduous testing brewing thousands of cups at coffee events, asked other coffee lovers for feedback, and further improved the design. Then in March this year, we ordered our third simpli press prototype from our manufacturing partner and are almost ready for production.</p>
<p><b style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Manufacturing Costs</b></p>
<p>This is the most capital intensive part of our next phase. We have finalized our design, chosen our manufacturer and created a budget breaking down the costs for producing the initial molds, purchasing supplies, meeting the minimum quantity order, and shipping to consumers. We need your support to get simpli press to the next step.</p>
<p><b>Creating the 21st Century, Third Wave French press</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to not only develop a product, but to make great coffee accessible to all in today’s time. To do this, we need your support from this initial campaign to not only fund our production, but also get the word out about what we’re developing around the world.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","simpli press makes your coffee press ritual easy from brewing to cleanup, while giving you a richer, smoother, and more complexed brew.We also hope that you step into the specialty world of coffee a bit, if you haven’t yet.       

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Brewing with simpli press is easy and brings out more flavor profiles by allowing you to use fine to medium grounds, which also brews in half the time of a regular French press.  
Cleanup is even easier! See how simpli press is French press without the mess!
 
 
All the grounds lift up in the grounds container, along with the filter! You can then just take the grounds container to your compost bin, your plants, or your trash and easily chuck out the grounds! (Note: Disposing all the coffee grounds in the sink is a plumbing no-no so don’t do it!)
By not having to scrape and tamp out your glass carafe to get the grounds out, save not only time but hopefully money by less chances of breaking your carafe!

 
Get more out of your coffee by being able to use fine to medium grounds. With our special filter, you get a richer, smoother taste!
 
 
 
 
 
 
So what does choosing your grind size and an optional paper filter mean to you?
You can tailor your brew to fit your roast and preference *or* just keep it simple by using any available grounds that you have! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
 
 
 
 
When using fine-medium grinds, you not only get more LOVE and FLAVOR from your coffee but you also get a FASTER BREWING TIME because of the higher extraction rate! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We’ve brewed thousands of cups for coffee lovers, roasters, baristas, and coffee events across the country (NY Coffee Festival, Portland Coffee Fest, Coffee Con LA, SCAA Atlanta, etc), and here’s what they had to say about simpli press:
 


 PLAY 



We even won a New Product Award at Portland, coffee capital in America andjudged by top coffee industry experts (note: Seattle was full in attendance at this event too)!
 
 
 
 
 
 
Finally, a coffee press that consumers and coffee professionals both love and can use easily!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
simpli press is perfect for sharing or just have it all to yourself - you deserve it!
 
simpli press is eco-friendly, leaving only compostable grinds after your morning brew. 
 
 
We’re redefining the way people press coffee. We’ve come this far with an incredibly small team and a boot-strapped budget, and we are committed to making simpli press a success. We talked to various manufacturers and created our first prototype in February 2015. We got the second prototype September 2015, where we put it through arduous testing brewing thousands of cups at coffee events, asked other coffee lovers for feedback, and further improved the design. Then in March this year, we ordered our third simpli press prototype from our manufacturing partner and are almost ready for production.
Manufacturing Costs
This is the most capital intensive part of our next phase. We have finalized our design, chosen our manufacturer and created a budget breaking down the costs for producing the initial molds, purchasing supplies, meeting the minimum quantity order, and shipping to consumers. We need your support to get simpli press to the next step.
Creating the 21st Century, Third Wave French press
Our goal is to not only develop a product, but to make great coffee accessible to all in today’s time. To do this, we need your support from this initial campaign to not only fund our production, but also get the word out about what we’re developing around the world.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Simpli Press Mission
To make your coffee ritual more beautiful and easy in every way possible.
We want to make your coffee ritual easy from brewing to cleanup, while giving you the most delicious coffee.
We also want to make it easy and fun for you to try out different ways to make your brew to bring out the best in the roasts and according to your taste. We, as a company, will also incorporate giving back to education and coffee farming communities into our long-term plans.

have a carefully designed Appellate Court appeal against the IRS and Tax
Court who broke rules to avoid answering a narrow
and specific question chosen so they can't evade it: “Why is the
Court and IRS using the ordinary definition of the term 'compensation' (i.e. payment for service rendered), instead of the
statutory definition (which applies only to the pay of federal
workers)?” When the “Nonemployee compensation” block is filled out on the
1099 form, the statutory definition of ""compensation"" must apply. Note: This case does not apply to ""wages"" which has its own statutory definition.</p><p></p><p>The Appellate Court would not hear the case and dismissed it because I did not pay a $5,000 fine
from a previous appeal ruled to be “frivolous”. I need $6,500 to
pay that fine plus interest and funding fees to have this appeal
heard, and hold the government accountable to the law. If I don't reach my funding goal, I may be able to acquire funds from other sources. Excess funds will be used to support other efforts in this area. There is a deadline, still indefinite, to reinstate the appeal. For your contribution you can receive copies of my ebooks; larger contributions will receive a water ionizer good for health.</p><p>If I win the case, it will establish that ""compensation"" as statutorily defined only applies to federal workers, not to everyone, and will force the IRS to use the statutory definition, not the ordinary one.</p><p></p><p>
<b>The
Rules the IRS and Tax Court Broke</b></p>
<p>
This
is a summary; you can see the lengthy brief at http://<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><a href=""http://www.NaturalLawRemedy.com/taxcase.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.NaturalLawRemedy.com/taxcase.htm</a>.</span></p>
<p>
<b>Issue
1</b>:
<b>The
IRS and Tax Court used the ordinary meaning of “compensation”
instead of the statutory meaning provided by the Classification Act
of 1923 which only applies to the pay of federal workers, not
to everyone.</b>
When the block labeled “compensation” on the 1099 is filled out
by a contracting company, the definition of “compensation” also applies,
not the ordinary meaning. Since I did not work for any federal
entity, by definition my “compensation” was zero.</p>
<p>
Nowhere
in the briefs or court opinion would the Tax Court or IRS even
acknowledge the question, let alone answer it, and claimed the
assertion frivolous; yet, the assertion is not on the Secretary's
list of frivolous positions and no court has ever ruled on the question. A definition cannot be frivolous.</p>
<p>
<b>Issue
2</b>:
<b>The
Tax Court and IRS Did Not Deny Allegations and Should Lose by
Default. They broke Tax Court Rules 36(b) and (c) that require the
IRS to either admit or deny that “compensation” has a statutory
definition</b>
in order to inform the Court and myself of the nature of the defense.
The IRS claimed the question was not “material” and would
“neither admit nor deny”, which thereby should have been deemed
admitted. The Court broke the intended purpose of the rule, to inform
the parties of the defense.</p>
<p>
<b>Issue
3</b>: <b>Evidence from my contracting company that I received no “compensation” should have been
admitted. <b>The IRS and Court broke Federal Rules of Evidence 106 that says “</b><b>an adverse party may require the introduction</b><b>” of evidence.</b> </b>The
IRS introduced into evidence invoices from my contracting company showing that I received pay, but the Court
would not allow a letter from said contracting company who admitted that the pay
was not “compensation” as statutorily defined. Having accepted the IRS's evidence, the Court did not have discretion
to refuse my adverse evidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>:
The Court's ruling was arbitrary in that the Court could just as easily have
ruled in my favor since the IRS did not even attempt to rebut the
statutory definition of “compensation” or prove it was
immaterial, frivolous, or erroneous; the ruling was unreasonable in
that no reasoning regarding the definition was provided or cited; and

Here is an opportunity to stand up.I
have a carefully designed Appellate Court appeal against the IRS and Tax
Court who broke rules to avoid answering a narrow
and specific question chosen so they can't evade it: “Why is the
Court and IRS using the ordinary definition of the term 'compensation' (i.e. payment for service rendered), instead of the
statutory definition (which applies only to the pay of federal
workers)?” When the “Nonemployee compensation” block is filled out on the
1099 form, the statutory definition of ""compensation"" must apply. Note: This case does not apply to ""wages"" which has its own statutory definition.The Appellate Court would not hear the case and dismissed it because I did not pay a $5,000 fine
from a previous appeal ruled to be “frivolous”. I need $6,500 to
pay that fine plus interest and funding fees to have this appeal
heard, and hold the government accountable to the law. If I don't reach my funding goal, I may be able to acquire funds from other sources. Excess funds will be used to support other efforts in this area. There is a deadline, still indefinite, to reinstate the appeal. For your contribution you can receive copies of my ebooks; larger contributions will receive a water ionizer good for health.If I win the case, it will establish that ""compensation"" as statutorily defined only applies to federal workers, not to everyone, and will force the IRS to use the statutory definition, not the ordinary one.
The
Rules the IRS and Tax Court Broke

This
is a summary; you can see the lengthy brief at http://www.NaturalLawRemedy.com/taxcase.htm.

Issue
1:
The
IRS and Tax Court used the ordinary meaning of “compensation”
instead of the statutory meaning provided by the Classification Act
of 1923 which only applies to the pay of federal workers, not
to everyone.
When the block labeled “compensation” on the 1099 is filled out
by a contracting company, the definition of “compensation” also applies,
not the ordinary meaning. Since I did not work for any federal
entity, by definition my “compensation” was zero.

Nowhere
in the briefs or court opinion would the Tax Court or IRS even
acknowledge the question, let alone answer it, and claimed the
assertion frivolous; yet, the assertion is not on the Secretary's
list of frivolous positions and no court has ever ruled on the question. A definition cannot be frivolous.

Issue
2:
The
Tax Court and IRS Did Not Deny Allegations and Should Lose by
Default. They broke Tax Court Rules 36(b) and (c) that require the
IRS to either admit or deny that “compensation” has a statutory
definition
in order to inform the Court and myself of the nature of the defense.
The IRS claimed the question was not “material” and would
“neither admit nor deny”, which thereby should have been deemed
admitted. The Court broke the intended purpose of the rule, to inform
the parties of the defense.

Issue
3: Evidence from my contracting company that I received no “compensation” should have been
admitted. The IRS and Court broke Federal Rules of Evidence 106 that says “an adverse party may require the introduction” of evidence. The
IRS introduced into evidence invoices from my contracting company showing that I received pay, but the Court
would not allow a letter from said contracting company who admitted that the pay
was not “compensation” as statutorily defined. Having accepted the IRS's evidence, the Court did not have discretion
to refuse my adverse evidence.


Conclusion:
The Court's ruling was arbitrary in that the Court could just as easily have
ruled in my favor since the IRS did not even attempt to rebut the
statutory definition of “compensation” or prove it was
immaterial, frivolous, or erroneous; the ruling was unreasonable in
that no reasoning regarding the definition was provided or cited; and
unjust in that the Court broke Rules 36(b) and (c) by allowing the
IRS to neither admit nor deny allegations which should have been
deemed admitted, and broke FRE 106 by allowing IRS's documents into
evidence, but not my related document.

<div>
<div>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Motion sensor activated video security systems</b> use passive infra-red motion sensors, which when set off, start a video recording or create some sort of alert. They rely on picking up heat sources and a motion ‘sensitivity’ setting. Set the sensitivity too high, and there can be a lot of false alarms. Set the sensitivity too low, and the sensor might actually miss important events. Plus, it’s often easy to fool the sensors so they don’t pick up body heat.</p>

<h2><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></h2>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<h4><b>1. Purchasing and Setup</b></h4>
<div>
<b>What sort of locations can I use CleverLoop in?</b><br/>
</div>
<p>CleverLoop is used for home security protection
and monitoring, and also provides a great solution for small businesses looking
for increased security. </p>
<p>Being quick to install, easy to operate
and very cost effective to use, people are using CleverLoop in many locations, from homes and apartments to offices.</p>
<p><b>What
if I buy more than 1 CleverLoop Base Station?</b></p>
<p>If you purchase multiple CleverLoop Base Stations to
use in different locations (i.e. 1 at home and 1 in your office or second
home), you can access each of these, and the cameras connected to each, from
the same app on your mobile device. The number of CleverLoop devices supported by
the CleverLoop app on your phone or tablet is unlimited. Quite a few users have also bought 2 Base Stations for their home, meaning they can use upto 6 cameras in total.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How
many cameras can a single CleverLoop Base Station support?</b></p>
<p>A single CleverLoop Base Station can support a maximum
of 3 HD indoor and outdoor cameras. </p>
<p><b>How
many cameras should I buy?</b></p>
<p>This really depends on the layout of
your home or small office, but here are some ideas:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>1 indoor camera for houses / apartments / offices that have 1 entrance or main hallway.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>2
or 3 cameras for homes / offices with additional entrances or those that have bedrooms,
living rooms or other spaces that have external doors and windows.<br/><br/>· 2 outdoor cameras for both the front and rear door of a home or office and 1 indoor camera for the room with the most valuable items or a garage.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Where
should I place CleverLoop in my home / office?</b></p>
<p>The CleverLoop Base Station can be placed anywhere in your
home or office where it can be plugged into a router that has internet
connectivity - to operate, the Base Station must always be plugged into a router. Your Wi-Fi cameras also need to be within the signal range of
your router. The
best place to position your cameras is somewhere they can best see full images
of people, for example in the corner of a room or capturing an entire
entranceway.</p>
<p><b>What
if I want to move CleverLoop to somewhere else?</b></p>
<p>You can easily move the CleverLoop Base Station to a
different location. Moving to a new house or want to keep an eye on something elsewhere?
You simply unplug the Base station and take it to the new location and then set it up
again, along with the required camera(s). It will take CleverLoop a little while
to learn about the new situation and the new location.</p>
<p><b>How
easy is it to set up CleverLoop?</b></p>
<p>CleverLoop is super easy to set up. You
just need to plug the Base Station and your HD camera into your router and then use
your mobile device to scan a QR code which is located on the underside of
the Base Station unit. The CleverLoop mobile app will then guide you through a few steps.
Done! You can now unplug your camera and place it in the location you want to
monitor.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>2. Compatibility with Cameras and Phones </b></h4>
<p><b>What mobile phones and tablets will support the CleverLoop App?</b></p>
<p>CleverLoop has two different apps and these will work on any mobile device that runs either:</p>
<p>· iOS version 7.0 and above, or</p>
<p>· Android version 4.0 and above.</p>
<p><b>Can I use CleverLoop with my PC or MAC?</b><br/></p>
<p>CleverLoop is only accessible via the iOS and Android apps at the present, but we are working on an in-browser feature.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>3. Video Storage Options</b></h4>
<div><b><b>Does CleverLoop come with an SD card?</b></b></div>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p>Yes, CleverLoop comes with an 8G SD card. You
can use this SD card to store important event footage locally.</p>
<p><b><b>What options do I have for storing footage in the cloud?</b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>All users of CleverLoop
will receive free use of the CleverLoop cloud service for important events from
the last 7 days. This free option will always be available and gives you
complete access to store, view and download important footage from the last 7 days.
This service is also contract free.</p>
<p>In the future we may
provide additional cloud services or premium features.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can I continuously store footage on an external hard drive or a USB Flash Drive?</b><br/><br/>Yes! Simply connect an external hard drive or USB Flash drive into the USB port on the back of your Base Station, turn your Base Station off and back on (wait about 10 seconds before re-powering) and continuous storage is activated. </p>
<p>At present, continuous storage is set to come on when your system is disarmed using either geofencing or scheduling. This means that when you are at home you can continuously record activities taking place around the house without being sent alerts every time a person walks past a camera. This is also useful in small businesses and shops where you want to record continuously during opening hours, but receive alerts about unusual activity after-hours.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>4. Technical Information</b></h4>
<p><b>Can I set up
more than one person with the app so they can access my CleverLoop video and also
receive alerts?</b></p>
<p>Yes, if you choose, multiple users can be supported
by one CleverLoop device. This means you and your family can all access the
CleverLoop system that’s in your home, with each person having their own username and
password. There is no additional cost to add additional people to your 'Security Loop'.</p>
<p>With CleverLoop you also set up a 'Master User' who has the ability to view other users of the same Base Station and remove them from the system.</p>
<p><b>Will I get alarms when I, or my family members, walk around the house? </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>CleverLoop’s geo-fencing feature means you don’t have to manually turn the system on every time you go out and off every time you come home. It simply detects when your smartphone is near to the Base Station using your location and saves you the hassle.<br/></p>
<p>You can use the scheduling inactive times feature to set working hours for CleverLoop so it automatically turns alarm and/or recording functions on or off, following the time you set.</p>
<p><b>Will
my pets cause false alarm issues?</b></p>
<p>The short answer is no. CleverLoop quickly sorts important activities from unimportant movements, meaning you only receive instant alerts that matter. You can also teach CleverLoop about your specific envinronment by providing feedback on any alerts you recieve. This rapid learning feature lets you decide what triggers alerts in the future.</p>
<p><b>What
sort of power supply does CleverLoop use?</b></p>
<p>CleverLoop plugs directly into your home’s
power sockets. Each CleverLoop Base Station, and each camera, will be supplied with a power
cable that is suitable for use in your country i.e. correct voltage input and correct
configuration of pins on the plug. </p>
<p><b>What
happens if there is a power outage or an internet outage?</b></p>
<p>CleverLoop has a power and internet outage alert function. This means that if there is a power or internet outage, you will receive an instant alert on your mobile phone informing you that CleverLoop is offline.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What
is CleverLoop's WiFi Range</b><b>?</b></p>

CleverLoop uses the Wi-Fi signal from your router to connect to cameras.
This means that it is the strength of your router signal and the proximity of the
router to your wireless cameras that is important.</div>
<div>
<br/><h4><b>5. Privacy</b></h4>
<div><b>How
private is cloud stored video footage?</b></div>
<p>CleverLoop uses bank-level security. All
communication between your CleverLoop Base Station, the CleverLoop server and your smart phone
is encrypted over SSL (HTTPS). </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can
I turn off the video recording?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you can turn off video recording through the app by disabling the cameras or by using various armed and disarmed functions. Or just pull the plug out! :)</p>
<p><b>Can
somebody else gain control of CleverLoop and my cameras?</b></p>
<p>CleverLoop is super secure and uses high
level encryption to make sure it stays secure. The main thing to remember, as
with any secured websites that you use, is to choose a strong password, to keep
that password safe, and to change it regularly. As mentioned earlier, with CleverLoop you can also set up a 'Master User' who has the ability to view other users of the same Base Station and remove them from the system.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><b>What happens if someone breaks in and steals my CleverLoop Base Station?</b></b></p>
<p>If someone breaks in and steals your Base Station then footage will be stored in the cloud of any unusual events that
take place within view of your HD cameras and based on the alert setting you
choose, you will also receive an instant alert. 
An offline / power outage alert will also be generated and sent to your
mobile device.</p>

""CleverLoop actually might be onto something. I’m truly blown away by the system...The setup for the CleverLoop system is insanely easy...I truly think that everyone looking to outfit their homes with a security system should look into the CleverLoop."" - TalkAndroid (January 2016)
“CleverLoop stands out in a sea of DIY home security systems, because it can actually learn about what it
sees—and alert the homeowner accordingly. In other words, this solution is sort
of like the Nest for the home security market.” Electronic House (December 2015)

Features






What I like about CleverLoop...
                                 —Backer feedback from Gary Moore, Colorado, United States
See, Think, Act, Learn.
CleverLoop thinks about what your cameras are seeing, taking action based on your own personal settings. And, with your help, CleverLoop keeps learning what’s important, and what’s not important, to you.


See what is really happening in your home using compatible high-definition cameras. The best security systems all use high quality, high definition cameras to help you see what is happening. 


Local footage analysis adds security and personal privacy. CleverLoop analyzes your HD camera video using smart detection algorithms, right there in your home. CleverLoop figures out what's happening, without sending footage to the cloud for external scrutiny.




Choose the right action with CleverLoop's simple storage and alert settings. You decide what alerts you receive, and you control what footage is stored where. With cloud and local storage options, CleverLoop gives you the perfect mix of security and privacy.




With CleverLoop's 'Clever Learning', you decide what's important. Forget about endless false alarms. CleverLoop will quickly sort the important from the unimportant. That way next time something happens, you only receive instant alerts that matter to you.





False alarms cause unnecessary stress and are one of the biggest reasons why people turn off their security system.



What I like about CleverLoop...

                                            —Backer feedback from Annie, California, United States





Making sure your most important people, places, pets and possessions are safe and sound






Whether you’re at the corner store or across the world, CleverLoop puts high definition cameras to work for you.


Right there on your mobile device, you can view live or recorded camera footage of your home, and receive instant alerts about unusual events. And with night-vision cameras, that secure feeling is within reach, both day and night. 




Protecting your privacy, as well as your home 







When it comes to offering privacy and security, CleverLoop is unique.  The innovation comes from how it analyzes video and stores footage.

Some security systems rely on old motion sensor technology to activate video cameras, whilst others don't even use cameras. Other hi-tech, camera based systems send continuous video footage to the cloud for analysis. But how secure is this?
Security breaches are becoming increasingly common, with unscrupulous organizations and individuals accessing  our private information. This is why CleverLoop does the smart analysis in-home, and gives you local and cloud storage options.




Joseph Mayton, reporting on the acquisition of Dropcam by Google owned Nest. Tech Times | June 21, 2014An end to false alarms caused by most pets





CleverLoop sees the room you
are monitoring as well as the small pets moving around within it, and learns very quickly
what you don’t want to be alerted to. 
Regular motion sensors detect small pets, which means false
alarms. Even ‘pet immune’ motion sensors are still prone to false alarms. And then there’s the old trick of tilting sensors
towards the ceiling to reduce the amount of movement they pick up, which is hardly ideal! 
With CleverLoop in action you can leave your house with the
peace of mind that comes with having video security and instant alerts, whilst
also knowing that your small pet won’t cause you the
worry of false alarms. 
Plus, from your mobile device you can check in on live
footage just to see how your other ‘family member’ is getting on.


Simple to set up & super easy to use





From opening the box through to watching saved footage, CleverLoop is super easy to set up and use.
CleverLoop simply plugs into your Wi-Fi router and wirelessly links to a maximum of three indoor or outdoor security cameras. With built in step-by-step video guides on the iOS or Android app, you can set up CleverLoop in minutes. You can then control every setting and view every important moment directly on your mobile device, no matter where you are in the world. 
Save footage and money


CleverLoop is great value.

Shortfalls of other security systems
Non-video security systems usually only send an alarm if a door or window is opened. Used alone, they are limited by the fact that you can’t see what’s happening, which means you don’t know if something is a false alarm or a real problem. Plus, you can’t capture important moments or unusual events on video.


Motion sensor activated video security systems use passive infra-red motion sensors, which when set off, start a video recording or create some sort of alert. They rely on picking up heat sources and a motion ‘sensitivity’ setting. Set the sensitivity too high, and there can be a lot of false alarms. Set the sensitivity too low, and the sensor might actually miss important events. Plus, it’s often easy to fool the sensors so they don’t pick up body heat.

Frequently Asked Questions

1. Purchasing and Setup

What sort of locations can I use CleverLoop in?

CleverLoop is used for home security protection
and monitoring, and also provides a great solution for small businesses looking
for increased security. 
Being quick to install, easy to operate
and very cost effective to use, people are using CleverLoop in many locations, from homes and apartments to offices.
What
if I buy more than 1 CleverLoop Base Station?
If you purchase multiple CleverLoop Base Stations to
use in different locations (i.e. 1 at home and 1 in your office or second
home), you can access each of these, and the cameras connected to each, from
the same app on your mobile device. The number of CleverLoop devices supported by
the CleverLoop app on your phone or tablet is unlimited. Quite a few users have also bought 2 Base Stations for their home, meaning they can use upto 6 cameras in total.

How
many cameras can a single CleverLoop Base Station support?
A single CleverLoop Base Station can support a maximum
of 3 HD indoor and outdoor cameras. 
How
many cameras should I buy?
This really depends on the layout of
your home or small office, but here are some ideas:
· 
1 indoor camera for houses / apartments / offices that have 1 entrance or main hallway.
· 
2
or 3 cameras for homes / offices with additional entrances or those that have bedrooms,
living rooms or other spaces that have external doors and windows.· 2 outdoor cameras for both the front and rear door of a home or office and 1 indoor camera for the room with the most valuable items or a garage.

Where
should I place CleverLoop in my home / office?
The CleverLoop Base Station can be placed anywhere in your
home or office where it can be plugged into a router that has internet
connectivity - to operate, the Base Station must always be plugged into a router. Your Wi-Fi cameras also need to be within the signal range of
your router. The
best place to position your cameras is somewhere they can best see full images
of people, for example in the corner of a room or capturing an entire
entranceway.
What
if I want to move CleverLoop to somewhere else?
You can easily move the CleverLoop Base Station to a
different location. Moving to a new house or want to keep an eye on something elsewhere?
You simply unplug the Base station and take it to the new location and then set it up
again, along with the required camera(s). It will take CleverLoop a little while
to learn about the new situation and the new location.
How
easy is it to set up CleverLoop?
CleverLoop is super easy to set up. You
just need to plug the Base Station and your HD camera into your router and then use
your mobile device to scan a QR code which is located on the underside of
the Base Station unit. The CleverLoop mobile app will then guide you through a few steps.
Done! You can now unplug your camera and place it in the location you want to
monitor.

2. Compatibility with Cameras and Phones 
What mobile phones and tablets will support the CleverLoop App?
CleverLoop has two different apps and these will work on any mobile device that runs either:
· iOS version 7.0 and above, or
· Android version 4.0 and above.
Can I use CleverLoop with my PC or MAC?
CleverLoop is only accessible via the iOS and Android apps at the present, but we are working on an in-browser feature.


3. Video Storage Options
Does CleverLoop come with an SD card?


Yes, CleverLoop comes with an 8G SD card. You
can use this SD card to store important event footage locally.
What options do I have for storing footage in the cloud?

All users of CleverLoop
will receive free use of the CleverLoop cloud service for important events from
the last 7 days. This free option will always be available and gives you
complete access to store, view and download important footage from the last 7 days.
This service is also contract free.
In the future we may
provide additional cloud services or premium features.


Can I continuously store footage on an external hard drive or a USB Flash Drive?Yes! Simply connect an external hard drive or USB Flash drive into the USB port on the back of your Base Station, turn your Base Station off and back on (wait about 10 seconds before re-powering) and continuous storage is activated. 
At present, continuous storage is set to come on when your system is disarmed using either geofencing or scheduling. This means that when you are at home you can continuously record activities taking place around the house without being sent alerts every time a person walks past a camera. This is also useful in small businesses and shops where you want to record continuously during opening hours, but receive alerts about unusual activity after-hours.


4. Technical Information
Can I set up
more than one person with the app so they can access my CleverLoop video and also
receive alerts?
Yes, if you choose, multiple users can be supported
by one CleverLoop device. This means you and your family can all access the
CleverLoop system that’s in your home, with each person having their own username and
password. There is no additional cost to add additional people to your 'Security Loop'.
With CleverLoop you also set up a 'Master User' who has the ability to view other users of the same Base Station and remove them from the system.
Will I get alarms when I, or my family members, walk around the house? 

CleverLoop’s geo-fencing feature means you don’t have to manually turn the system on every time you go out and off every time you come home. It simply detects when your smartphone is near to the Base Station using your location and saves you the hassle.
You can use the scheduling inactive times feature to set working hours for CleverLoop so it automatically turns alarm and/or recording functions on or off, following the time you set.
Will
my pets cause false alarm issues?
The short answer is no. CleverLoop quickly sorts important activities from unimportant movements, meaning you only receive instant alerts that matter. You can also teach CleverLoop about your specific envinronment by providing feedback on any alerts you recieve. This rapid learning feature lets you decide what triggers alerts in the future.
What
sort of power supply does CleverLoop use?
CleverLoop plugs directly into your home’s
power sockets. Each CleverLoop Base Station, and each camera, will be supplied with a power
cable that is suitable for use in your country i.e. correct voltage input and correct
configuration of pins on the plug. 
What
happens if there is a power outage or an internet outage?
CleverLoop has a power and internet outage alert function. This means that if there is a power or internet outage, you will receive an instant alert on your mobile phone informing you that CleverLoop is offline.

What
is CleverLoop's WiFi Range?

CleverLoop uses the Wi-Fi signal from your router to connect to cameras.
This means that it is the strength of your router signal and the proximity of the
router to your wireless cameras that is important.

5. Privacy
How
private is cloud stored video footage?
CleverLoop uses bank-level security. All
communication between your CleverLoop Base Station, the CleverLoop server and your smart phone
is encrypted over SSL (HTTPS). 

Can
I turn off the video recording?
Yes, you can turn off video recording through the app by disabling the cameras or by using various armed and disarmed functions. Or just pull the plug out! :)
Can
somebody else gain control of CleverLoop and my cameras?
CleverLoop is super secure and uses high
level encryption to make sure it stays secure. The main thing to remember, as
with any secured websites that you use, is to choose a strong password, to keep
that password safe, and to change it regularly. As mentioned earlier, with CleverLoop you can also set up a 'Master User' who has the ability to view other users of the same Base Station and remove them from the system.

What happens if someone breaks in and steals my CleverLoop Base Station?
If someone breaks in and steals your Base Station then footage will be stored in the cloud of any unusual events that
take place within view of your HD cameras and based on the alert setting you
choose, you will also receive an instant alert. 
An offline / power outage alert will also be generated and sent to your
mobile device.

<h1>Technology Behind The Magic</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>Welle uses refined <b>Sonar technology</b> to instantly turn any surface into a smart controller. Sonar is widely used the fields of military, automotive and drones. Sonar transmits signal pulses and collects the reflected energy back from targets. The characteristics of the echoes are extracted and then translated into different instructions to Internet of Things devices using an advanced hardware design and software algorithms.</p>

<p><b><i> </i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Why ultrasound technology stands out?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i> </i></b></p>
<p>The ultrasound technology that Welle is using, enables farther detection range, higher tolerance to light condition and lower power consumption.</p>
<ul><li>Ultrasound stands out with meter-level detection range, compared to Infrared and capacity with merely centimeter-level detection range. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Ultrasound does not malfunction under dim or no-light condition, while Infrared cannot detect gestures under dim light condition or with black color surface. Optic sensors have very low accuracy under undesired light condition as well. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Ultrasound consumes only mili-watt power and last hours longer than other technology, under the same battery size.</li></ul>

<p> </p>
<p>Welle uses this same technology to collect and interpret complex information to identify motions and gestures from the echoed signals. Welle tracks your fingers when you touch a surface and it can even recognize handwriting motions and transform them to customized actions with a high degree of accuracy.</p>

With Welle, we are going to upgrade it and bring you the newest yet the most nature interaction experience.""Click HERE for Press Kit ""The Best Technology 2017"" at Global Source Startup Launchpad    Introducing Welle   ""World's first sonar based gesture control gadget that can make any surface interactive.""Welle is a smart device that instantly turns any surface into a smart controller using embedded Sonar and a highly sensitive gesture algorithm. It gives you the ability to use simple gestures or shortcuts to control your favorite functions or connected devices.     Make Control Simpler 
As the technology develops, we are currently facing two fundamental problems: 

Limited interactive surface
Limited input richness

Welle is intend to solve these by expanding input area while increasing input modalities.
 
Change color with one swipe

 
Turn off TV without looking for remote
 
 
Built for work, play and in between

 

 

 
Endless Possibilities
 
Welcome to the modern world of intelligent device control. Welle works in the home, office or anywhere with a Bluetooth connection. Welle uses the most advanced gesture control for your household smart appliances that replaces traditional remote controls for a convenient and enjoyable connected home or office experience. Simply place Welle in a convenient location and use hand gestures to control all your smart devices such as: lights, TVs, speakers, doors, thermostats, cameras, curtains, fans, and more.
 

 


 

 

  
How to Setup
 
It’s easy to control devices via Welle. Just set up the gestures in any form, touch, swipe, word, number or anything else. Then draw up the gestures anywhere closed to Welle to control the devices. It looks like you are in a augmented reality. Magic!
Welle is easy-to-setup in just a few minutes.

Connect Bluetooth
Initial Install
App Setup

Welle provides Apps for Android and iOS users.
 

  

 
Technology Behind The Magic
 
Welle uses refined Sonar technology to instantly turn any surface into a smart controller. Sonar is widely used the fields of military, automotive and drones. Sonar transmits signal pulses and collects the reflected energy back from targets. The characteristics of the echoes are extracted and then translated into different instructions to Internet of Things devices using an advanced hardware design and software algorithms.

 
Why ultrasound technology stands out?
 
The ultrasound technology that Welle is using, enables farther detection range, higher tolerance to light condition and lower power consumption.
Ultrasound stands out with meter-level detection range, compared to Infrared and capacity with merely centimeter-level detection range. 
Ultrasound does not malfunction under dim or no-light condition, while Infrared cannot detect gestures under dim light condition or with black color surface. Optic sensors have very low accuracy under undesired light condition as well. 
Ultrasound consumes only mili-watt power and last hours longer than other technology, under the same battery size.

 
Welle uses this same technology to collect and interpret complex information to identify motions and gestures from the echoed signals. Welle tracks your fingers when you touch a surface and it can even recognize handwriting motions and transform them to customized actions with a high degree of accuracy.
Acoustic Field Simulation for Obstacle Location
 
Patent-Pending Technology
 
Conventional gesture detectors, such as those in smartphones only provide single gesture readings. Welle, in contrast, can provide rich information, such as trajectory data, digitized gestures and even handwriting recognition, enabling a wide variety of control functions for everyday convenience. 
 
 

 

 

 
People Say Wow
 
Our goal was to create convenient control for people at home and at work. We created technology that adds pleasure to life. The feedback has been amazing. The first reaction that people have is “Wow!” then they ask how they can get a Welle for themselves and their friends. We love that!

The Ergo Kiwi is an innovative ergonomic cutting tool designed to reduce stress, strain and promote prolonged productivity. The idea came about in my first year of architecture school. Our instructors had us using standard pen knives that kill your fingers after using them for hours.
After a huge success on our Kickstarter, raising more than $62,000 from 1200 backers, we have decided to extend our offering here on Indiegogo.

CNC milled plywood Kiwi


 PLAY



Changing blades has never been easier, it's almost as easy as the Kiwi is on your hands! The shape of the handle eliminates the hyperextension in your distal interphalangeal joint (that’s the first joint in your index finger) and its organic form allows you to hold it in any position that is most natural for you. This reduces the stress and strain of making dozens of cuts allowing you to work for longer periods of time. It’s essentially your hand’s new best friend.CNC milled Bocote KiwiHow it works!Embedded in the handle is a magnet which allows you to pick the blade up off of any surface safely, reducing the risk of injury.The magnet also holds the blade in place and makes for easy storage. The handle will stick to pretty much any metallic surface (table legs, magnet strips, refrigerators, car doors, etc.). There is also a latch integrated into the handle which utilizes the prefabricated holes in the blades to lock them in place, preventing the blade from getting stuck in thicker materials. This patent pending design also allows for easy blade changes and reduces the amount of moving parts in the handle. No more tightening the blade in place just to have it come undone after a few cuts.the magnet in actionCrafting the Kiwi!
Prototyping HandlesA thoroughly tested design that is the result of more than 100 prototypes!We spent 2 years and made over 100 prototypes and wanted to make sure the form and function was perfect before we asked for funding. We sketched, carved, and 3D printed more than 100 prototypes to test and refine the ergonomics as well as the magnet and fastening mechanism.Blades that are compatible with the Ergo KiwiPartnerships!We've partnered with Excel blades to bring you the highest quality blades on the marketMade in the USA, but all brands work! Quality and craftsmanship are of utmost importance to us and we have endeavored to source all of our components from US-based manufacturing facilities. Each of our rewards comes with a minimum of a 5-pack set of Excel blades.Choose your Kiwi!The Kiwi is available in 4 different finishes: injection molded white plastic, plywood, and two exotic woods: Padauk and Bocote. The wooden handles are CNC milled and hand finishedwith the utmost attention to detail and craft ensuring a long life span. Each wooden handle comes in a handmade canvas storage bag along with five Excel blades. All of the materials and components that go into the Kiwi are sourced and manufactured in the United States. The wooden handles are handcrafted in Boston, MA.Each wooden Kiwi comes with a handmade canvas bag! We want to provide both affordable injection molded Kiwis for architecture and design students as well as beautiful solid wood Kiwis for the discerning craftsman.Padauk Kiwi.Why we need your help!Despite how awesome the wooden handles are we really want to make the affordable injection molded plastic handles available to every art and architecture student. We've picked out high-quality US-based manufacturers that can produce the injection molded parts but the upfront tooling costs for manufacturing are quite expensive.

<p>Hi. I'm Terry from Mr. Locksmith.</p>
<p>I'm a third generation locksmith. I have a criminology degree. I've been in the locksmithing business for over 35 years. When I was even in kindergarten I was making sets of picks out of bobby pins. </p>
<p>I still have my first set of picks that I basically built myself from Alan keys, bits of hack saws, spring steel when I could get it. So, I've been building my own picks my entire life. I've been teaching locksmith's, police, government agencies, for a long time how to open locks. Covert, overt, substitious entry. I've been teaching picking forever. </p>
<p>I finally decided to put together my own pick set, my own training eBook, as well as a series of videos on how to pick locks. I've just come off a very successful campaign. It was fantastic. It was 650% funded. When we launched this campaign on Kickstarter, it got over $13,000 in funding. I'm very proud of that. I've decided to go ahead with a long term project I've been thinking for a long time. I'm going to have my own set of picks, my own training manuals, and my own training videos on how to pick locks.</p>
<p>The picks that I'm manufacturing for Indiegogo are made of high quality North American made steel. This is the best steel available from Canadian or American manufacturers. We've got the best. The stuff you're buying offshore doesn't last a real locksmith one lock. My picks are high quality steel, they're manufactured in North America and the picks are fantastic. </p>
<p>The set will include the basic picks, the ball, the rake, the hook. Those are what you have to use as a beginner. The three basic picks that you have to start learning with is the diamond, the hook, and the rake. These are our beginner picks but also some advanced locksmiths just like these picks. These are the basics, however, when you get your skill sets improved, and also as you run across different manufacturers you use specific picks for that. This is one of my favorite picks, the quality here, I can bend this, it just springs right back. It's high quality spring steel as opposed to the offshore made. </p>
<p>Tension wrenches, same thing, high quality that'll last you a long time. Good, high quality, North American made picks. </p>
<p>In the past there was a well known, successful Indiegogo campaign, however, they never shipped. I've been in the business 35 years. I have a successful franchise, I've been selling products for years, I will not only have a successful Indiegogo campaign, I will ship the product pretty quick. I already know what I want, I already have my manufacturers. I have everything in place. I just need you to back the project and we will get another successful campaign. </p>
<p>The pick set will include the basics. Diamond pick, hook pick, rake pick. Those are the most popular. Then, they're going to include some of the more advanced ones. Some people call it the curved diamond or the deforest pick. There's various names given to it. And, a few other specialized picks and I have a really cool pick for picking one of the most popular locks sold out there which they say is unpick-able. So, I have a special pick for that. And, the tension wrenches are really, really important. So, it's not only going to be the pick set but it's going to be the tension sets. As an added bonus, you're not only going to get the pick set, my favourite tension wrenches, my eBook, my videos on how to pick lock, as an added bonus I'm going to include my dumb key force tool from my previous Kickstarter campaign free. It's an extra. It's fantastic. You'll love it. This is going to be a fantastic Indiegogo campaign. It's going to be huge. You're going to love it. It's got excellent value for the dollar. </p>

</h3>We are in the process of starting a food product business and are ready for a boost of energy to get things really moving! The first product is a line of Paleo Tea Cakes to be sold as pastries to cafes &amp; tea shops. They come in several flavors including Vanilla Maple, Chocolate Hazelnut, Superfruit Cake, and Ginger Spice. <br/><br/>These nutty morsels are part protein bar, part energy drink, and wholly amazing! <br/>The story began as an attempt to increase my omega-3 EFA consumption. I tried several methods and eventually fell in love with chia seeds. And as in any love affair, one thing leads to another and...POW! These beautiful little tea cakes are the result of a few years of experimenting with different mixtures of seeds, nuts, fruits, herbs, spices, roots, berries, and honey formed into small, dense cakes that are uncooked and very rich in nutrients. They are great by themselves, as an addition to trail mix, smeared with jam for a decadent dessert, soaked overnight and added to smoothies, taken on picnics, hikes, backpacking adventures, or intergalactic travel, and of course, they are great with tea and company!<br/><br/>Many thanks to my friends &amp; cohorts in T.N.T Taiko for being grateful test subjects!<br/><br/>Our initial marketing will be aimed towards coffee shops, tea houses, and other interested local Boulder businesses. Our next goal will be internet sales and expanding outside of Boulder. Our final goal is to be in health food stores. <br/><br/>We already have interest from the following Boulder businesses:<br/><br/> The Unseen Bean coffee shop<br/><br/>Once the tea cakes are rolling, we will begin work on Kozmik Kondiments. Ever order a delicious free-range burger with organic fries and have them put Heinz ketchup on the table? Well, we want to have our Kozmik Ketchup put on the table instead, along with our mustard and picante sauce. We will be producing one basic line of condiments to be sold in bulk to restaurants and a gourmet line to be sold in stores with flavors like Chili Lime Mustard, Mango Sriracha, Curry Catsup, and Pineapple Habanero Salsa.<br/><br/>It is our sincerest goal to make the most nutritious and delicious foods possible and dedicate ourselves to using organic, fair-trade, sustainably harvested ingredients utilizing as many local sources as possible. We also plan on winning competitions with our recipes and continuing our education in nutrition &amp; preparation techniques.<br/><br/>The 5-year plan is to produce these food products from our own food truck and/or restaurant and to supply a good amount of the food from our own farm all of which will be owned &amp; operated by a worker co-op with the aim of becoming an international model for sustainable living &amp; regenerative economics.<br/><br/><p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We are seeking capital for some basic start-up needs...<br/><br/>- $1500 will enable us to purchase initial bulk ingredients.<br/>- $3600 will pay for an entire year's rent at a certified kitchen share facility.<br/>- $5000 should be enough to get us a used minivan.<br/>- $200 will pay for licenses, fees, and permits.<br/>- $800 will be enough to purchase some nice grinding equipment.<br/>- $1500 will provide fair wages to helping hands for a few months.<br/>- $500 will enable us to purchase recycled packaging.<br/>- $500 will be enough for some basic marketing.<br/><br/>We know this adds up to $13,600, but we figure that there is no need to pay a full-year's lease up front, nor pay all wages up front. Hence, the nice round starting figure of $10,000.<br/><br/>So, i have heard phrases like ""follow your bliss"" and ""go big or go home"" and ""strive for your dreams"" and many similar tidbits of wisdom. The tea cake &amp; condiment business can easily get off the ground with ten thousand dollars, but what if this campaign goes viral? Then what? Here is what we will do if we exceed our goal. Here is me aiming for the stars...<br/><br/>- $10,000 will be enough to get the condiment business rolling strong.<br/>- $40,000 will get us a NEW delivery van. Possibly even an electric one!<br/>- $30,000 will pay fees &amp; tuition for a Master's degrees in nutrition, permaculture certifications, and a variety of workshops, seminars, and retreats concerning horticulture, community development, economics, and health &amp; wellness...overall, an essential scholarship fund for continuing education of the community.<br/>- $50,000 will get us started on a restaurant or a food truck.<br/>- $100,000 will be enough for a restaurant AND a food truck, staff, and a few months of ingredients and marketing budget.<br/>- $1,000,000 will get us the whole kit-and-kaboodle...farm, restaurant, food truck, supplies, equipment, and starting capital for several cottage industries to be directed and operated by the worker co-operative.<br/><br/><br/>Several benefits will result from your donations...<br/><br/>- You get free food samples and recipes.<br/>- You can be connected to a community of people passionate about health &amp; wellness.<br/>- Our products will promote healthy eating &amp; increase the vitality of people and the community.<br/>- This cottage industry will create jobs, stimulate fair trade, &amp; create opportunities for other entrepreneurs.<br/>- We will be focusing on local markets and economy first &amp; foremost.<br/>- The website <a href=""http://www.kozmikfood.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kozmikfood.com</a> will have an active blog with information &amp; dialogue concerning health &amp; wellness.<br/><br/> Upon attaining the farm goal, we will be contributing to the organic food supply, invigorating the industrial hemp movement, modelling sustainable &amp; regenerative living, improving the Earth for future generations, cooking amazing food for social gatherings, educating on health &amp; wellness, networking with other like-minded businesses &amp; individuals, and, in short, nourishing the galaxy one bite at a time - body, mind, &amp; spirit.<br/><br/>We are out to thrive and become successful, but not wealthy. We believe that most of the worlds problems are directly connected to lack of education &amp; lack of access to clean air, water, &amp; food. Therefore, we are seeking to ally with a local non-profit or two that work directly with the undernourished and undereducated, especially children. We will commit part of our profits to benefit these organizations.<br/><br/>We also believe that crowd funding is one of the most revolutionary developments in the history of business! If we reach our goal, we will donate up to 10% back to other crowd funding efforts.<br/><br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<br/>There are many ways this business model will impact the world. First and foremost, we will be nourishing people! We believe that good, smart nutrition can alleviate many of the world's problems. We will also be creating jobs and entrepreneurial opportunities. Our worker cooperative honors each participant for their time and talents giving fair, livable wages, profit sharing incentives, and encouragement to grow and expand the business into new areas. Our commitment to organic ingredients helps our little spaceship Earth provide sustenance &amp; resources for many future generations. And our commitment to fair trade commerce guarantees that a good portion of your dollar reaches the hands who picked the raw ingredients. Our farm community will be a model of sustainable &amp; regenerative living skills. We will be providing educational experiences (internships, workshops, classes, webinars, etc.) which will spread this vital information to different parts of the globe and generally increase awareness of the interconnectedness between personal health &amp; environmental health.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<br/>Not many risks or challenges with the Tea Cake cottage industry. Everyone loves them. Coffee shops want them. We are happy to make them. If we just get off the ground selling Tea Cakes, we would be very happy and so would many others!<br/><br/>The real risks and challenges come in the next stages. Finding a way to make organic condiments inexpensive enough to compete in the restaurant supply business will be quite challenging. But with a focus on the ""local"" &amp; ""organic"" marketing strategies, we are certain to get into a few restaurants...enough to give us bulk purchasing discounts. Many more risks come with opening a restaurant. One member of our team is a successful &amp; experienced restaurant manager who will minimize many of the risks, and we are confident that our unique restaurant concept will be a hit in Boulder...""the foodiest town in America."" The biggest risk of getting to the farm stage is the cost of property. We do not want to get saddled with an exorbitant mortgage that will keep us working overtime just to afford, and that is a challenge anywhere near Boulder. Hence, the $1 million goal...at least half of which may go towards property purchase unless we find that rare screaming deal. Once we establish the farm, the only risk will be the weather. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Folks who are unable to contribute $$ may be able to help us with other things...<br/>- we need a couple of iPads or other tablet for on-site payments<br/>- leads on tea shops, coffee shops, or other vendors who might be interested in selling our tea cakes. Outside-the-box ideas are very welcome.

Since we have been together for as long as we have, we have more or less amassed most of the household items and material possesions that we really need, except for the funding.  We are more than happy to accept donations to this fund in lieu of wedding gifts.  Ideally, we want to raise about 10 grand so that we can easily afford the dresses, tuxes, reception hall, rehearsal dinner and honeymoon, but we will truly be happy with whatever amount people are willing to give, even if we don't reach this specific goal.
Of course, anyone contributing will be automatically invited to the wedding even if you're not on our initial list, and anyone contributing $100 or more will also be invited to the rehearsal dinner and show afterwards.
Please share this to anyone you think may want to contribute, and help us to become an official family.
Thanks, everyone for your time and consideration.

Randy Linn 'FreaKat' Russell",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

That's why we created Shellfire VPN, an easy to use app that safely connects your Windows, Mac OS or Android device to our encrypted vpn network with just a few clicks. We have already helped more than 200,000 users worldwide secure their data and overcome censorship.</p><h2>Why Is That Not Enough?</h2><p>If you own many devices, securing all of them can get annoying and most ""smart"" devices don't even offer the possibility to establish a 
safe vpn connection, leaving your data exposed. That's why, many of our 
users have asked us for a simple solution to secure all their devices at
 once.</p><h2>Thinking Outside the Box</h2><p>In an attempt to provide these people with a good solution, we came up with the idea of the <strong>Shellfire Box</strong>, a tiny box that safely connects <strong>all</strong> your devices at once to our worldwide vpn network in a matter of seconds:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1298876/files/20150316084250-background-nc10_logo_1024.png?1426520570"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h2><b>Unlimited Connectivity</b></h2><p>With the Shellfire Box, you can easily secure all your devices, even those that don't 
offer any vpn capabilities (smart tvs, gaming consoles, bluray players, 
set top boxes etc. ). This allows you to access blocked content and 
surf safely, no matter where in the world you are located.</p><h2>Be Anywhere, Anytime</h2><p>We have been providing vpn tunnels for 5 years. During that time, we built a world-wide network of servers in 20 countries which allows you to virtually travel almost anywhere in the world within seconds and access content that is restricted to certain countries like websites, tv shows and youtube videos. The Shellfire Box reliably hides your true location and ip address from anyone on the web!</p><h2>Plug And Play</h2><p>One big difference between the Shellfire Box and other products is that we are designing it for the average user that does not know much about online security and encryption. Once connected to the internet, it will configure and connect itself automatically, meaning it requires absolutely zero expert knowledge! An easy-to-use web interface will allow you to switch your vpn server anytime. But if you're a true nerd, don't worry, you're also invited to the party! Just switch to the advanced interface and you have the full power of linux network tools at your hands!<br/></p><h2>No Tricks</h2><p>Like all our client-side software, the firmware of the Shellfire Box will be published as open source and vpn connections are established using OpenVPN. According to German laws, we are not obliged to keep any traffic / ip logs, so we don't.</p><p></p><h2><b>The Box In The News</b></h2><p><a href=""http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/shellfire-box-launches-on-indiegogo-16-04-2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1399906/files/20150420133447-Bildschirmfoto_2015-04-20_um_22.33.48.png?1429562087"" src="""" style=""""/> Geeky Gadgets</a></p><p><a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2015/04/18/the-backed-pack-a-vpn-secure-box-a-comfortable-keyboard-a-clever-waking-solution/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1399911/files/20150420133554-421248_10150621822554079_811021881_n.jpg?1429562154"" src="""" style=""""/>VentureBeat</a></p><h2>What Do I Get?</h2><div>- The Shellfire Box</div><div>- A 1 or 2 year subscription to Shellfire VPN Premium Plus</div><div>- Full access to our high-speed servers in 29 countries</div><div>

</h2>
<p><b>Who are you?</b></p>
<p>We are Florian and Max. Together, we have been running Shellfire for 
more than 12 years, providing different hosting services to the 
public.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1298880/files/20150316084354-snapshot_interview_3_1024.png?1426520634"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>Why are you doing this?</b></p>
<p>Because we believe that the internet should be a place of freedom while remaining a safe place for private data.</p>
<p><b>Do I need a Shellfire VPN subscription in order to use the Shellfire Box?</b><br/></p>
<p>The Shellfire Box comes with a 1 or 2 year subscription, depending
 on your order (except if you choose the ""Returning Customer"" perk). However, the box will not become useless if you don't 
choose to extend your subscription after that period, you will simply be
 switched to our free vpn service, providing you with a limited download
 speed and server choice.</p>
<p><b>Is there a way to use Shellfire VPN without the Shellfire Box?</b></p>
<p>Of course! Visit <a href=""https://www.shellfire.net/vpn/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.shellfire.net/vpn/</a>
 to download our free and easy to use apps for Windows, Mac OS and 
Android devices! Other devices running iOS, Linux etc. are also 
supported via 3rd party apps or by using OS-integrated vpn capabilities.</p>
<p><b>How is the Shellfire Box different from products like anonabox, invizbox etc.?</b></p>
<p>The Shellfire Box uses vpn (virtual private network) technology, establishing a fast connection to one of our vpn servers. <span>Contrary
 to other vpn routers, the Shellfire  Box comes pre-configured and 
setting it up requires absolutely zero nerdy expert knowledge! :) Most
 similar products use the Tor network instead of vpn. While Tor is a 
great way to protect your privacy, connections are often painfully slow 
and it is not easily possible to unblock restricted content that is only
 available in certain countries.</span></p>
<p><b>How can I change the settings of the Shellfire Box?</b></p>
<p>The Box comes pre-configured and will be immediately ready for use 
after plugging it in. If you want to switch to another vpn server, just 
log in to our easy to use web-interface with your browser. For 
further settings (e.g. for fixed ip networks), an advanced interface 
will also be available.</p>
<p><b>When will I get my Shellfire Box?</b></p>
<p>The Shellfire Box is here! All orders will be shipped within 24h on working days!</p>
<p><b>Will I be able to use my Shellfire VPN Account already before I get my box?</b></p>
<p>Yes! You will be able to use your Shellfire VPN account on your computer, smartphone or tablet right after your order.</p>
<p><span><b>What are the specs?</b></span></p>
<p>The Shellfire Box is based on Nexx WT3020 router hardware and will run a modified openwrt OS.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Which vpn technology will the Shellfire Box be using?</b></p>
<p>We will be using OpenVPN with AES encryption, widely considered as one of the safest technologies around.</p>
<p><strong>What download speeds should I expect?<br/></strong></p>
<p>We are still optimizing. Currently, we are reaching around 13 Mbit/s under perfect conditions. This is largely enough for streaming videos. We are still working on improving this figure but don't expect 50 Mbit/s, as encryption is pretty hardware intensive.<br/></p>
<p><b>Are there more pictures/videos/details?</b></p>
<p>Check back here regularly as we will be releasing updates soon! Also, follow us on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/shellfire.de"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://twitter.com/shellfire_en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> and <a href=""https://plus.google.com/b/102278695637538331175/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Google Plus</a> to be the first ones to know when new stuff is available!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Does the Shellfire Box connect to OpenVPN servers of other providers?</b></p>
<p>This will definitely be possible for advanced users. However, it requires more technical skills than the regular setup of the Shellfire Box. Our focus with the Shellfire Box is on the easy and intuitive usage. Users of the box don't have to fiddle around with ip-addresses and certificates to go online securely, but only plug the box in and connect to its wifi.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>Will I be able to connect to wireless hotspots using the Shellfire Box?</b></p>
<p>This will unfortunately not be possible as it would require a second wireless chip which our hardware does not have. It would also make setting up the box much more complicated. If you are on the go, you can just use our free apps for Windows, Mac OS or Android to connect your device directly to our servers without having to take the Shellfire Box with you.</p>
<p><b>Can I use my Shellfire VPN Account before I get the Shellfire Box?</b></p>
<p>Yes! When this campaign is over, we will activate your account so that you can use Shellfire VPN using our apps already before the Shellfire Box is shipped.</p>
<p><b>Is Shellfire VPN available for other devices as well?</b></p>
<p>Yes! We currently have apps for Windows, Mac OS and Android but other devices (linux, iOS etc.) can connect as well using 3rd party apps or using internal vpn capabilities of the OS. Let us know if you have any questions regarding your device!</p>
<p><b>How can I help the Shellfire Box become reality?</b></p>
<p>In order to support us, tweet and share this campaign on facebook
 or Google Plus! Also, obviously, the best support you can give us is by 
becoming a backer.</p>

<h2>Über Shellfire</h2>
<p>Wir glauben daran, dass ein freier und sicherer Zugang zum Internet für jeden Menschen auf dieser Welt ein Grundrecht ist. Deshalb haben wir Shellfire VPN entwickelt, eine einfache App, die dein WIndows, Mac OS oder Android Gerät mit wenigen Klicks sicher mit unserem weltweiten VPN Netz verbindet. Wir haben bereits über 200.000 Nutzern weltweit dabei geholfen, ihre Daten zu schützen und Zensur zu überwinden.</p>
<h2>Warum Ist Das Nicht Genug?</h2>
<p>Wenn du viele Geräte besitzt wird es irgendwann lästig, jedes Gerät einzeln abzusichern. Die meisten ""smarten"" Gerät bieten gar nicht die Möglichkeit, eine sichere VPN Verbindung aufzubauen und verschicken deine Daten somit ungeschützt. Deshalb haben uns viele unserer Nutzer nach einer Möglichkeit gefragt, <b>all</b> ihre Geräte auf einmal abzusichern.</p>
<h2>Um Die Ecke Gedacht</h2>
<p>Auf der Suche nach einer guten Lösung kamen wir auf die Idee, die <b>Shellfire Box</b> zu entwickeln. Eine kleine Box, die in wenigen Sekunden all deine Geräte gleichzeitig sicher mit unserem weltweiten VPN Netz verbindet:<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1318153/files/20150323081205-background-nc10_logo_1024.png?1427123525"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h2>Uneingeschränkte Konnektiviät</h2>
<p>Mit der Shellfire Box kannst du ganz einfach all deine Geräte absichern, selbst solche, die keine VPN Verbindungen aufbauen können (Smart TVs, Spielekonsolen, Bluray Player, Set Top Boxen etc.). Dadurch kannst du auf blockierte Inhalte zugreifen und sicher surfen, ganz egal, wo auf der Welt du dich gerade befindest.<br/></p>
<h2>Sei Wo Du Willst, Wann Immer Du Möchtest</h2>
<p>Wir hosten seit 5 Jahren VPN Tunnel. In dieser Zeit haben wir ein weltweites Netz mit Servern in 20 Ländern aufgebaut. Das erlaubt dir, in wenigen Sekunden deinen virtuellen Standort fast überall auf die Welt zu verlegen und somit Inhalte anzusehen, die in deinem Land eigentlich nicht verfügbar oder zensiert sind (Video Streams, TV Serien, Youtube Videos etc.). Die Shellfire Box verbirgt zuverlässig deinen tatsächlichen Standort und deine IP Adresse vor neugierigen Augen im Internet!<br/></p>
<h2>Plug And Play</h2>
<p>Ein großer Unterschied zwischen der Shellfire Box und anderen Produkten ist, dass wir sie für den durchschnittlichen Internetnutzer designen, der nicht viel über Datensicherheit und Verschlüsselung weiß. Einmal mit dem Internet verbunden, konfiguriert sie sich selbst und verbindet sich automatisch. Das heißt, du brauchst absolut Null Expertenwissen, um die Shellfire Box zu nutzen! Ein simples Webinterface erlaubt es dir, jederzeit deinen VPN Server zu wechseln. Auch Nerds brauchen sich jedoch keine Sorgen zu machen. Aktiviere einfach das fortgeschrittene Interface und dir steht die volle Power von Linux Netzwerktools zur Verfügung!<br/></p>
<h2>Keine Tricks</h2>
<p>Wie all unsere Clientsoftware, wird auch die Firmware der Shellfire Box als Open Source veröffentlicht und alle Verbindungen werden über OpenVPN hergestellt. Laut deutscher Gesetzgebung sind wir nicht zum führen von Daten- / IP-Logs verpflichtet, also tun wir es auch nicht.</p>

<p><b>Was ist der Unterschied zwischen der Shellfire Box und anderen Produkten wie der Anonabox, Invizbox etc.</b>?<br/></p>
<p>Die Shellfire Box nutzt VPN (Virtual Private Network) Technologie, um eine schnelle und sichere Verbindung zu unseren Servern herzustellen. Im Gegensatz zu anderen VPN Routern kommt die Shellfire Box vorkonfiguriert und benötigt keinerlei Expertenwissen! :) Die meisten ähnlichen Produkte nutzen das Tor Netzwerk statt VPN. Tor ist zwar eine gute Möglichkeit, seine Privatsphäre zu schützen, allerdings sind die Verbindungen oftmals sehr langsam und es ist nicht immer einfach möglich, zensierte und blockierte Dienste, die nur in bestimmten Ländern verfügbar sind, gezielt zu entsperren.<br/></p>
<p><b>Wie kann ich die Einstellungen der Shellfire Box ändern?</b><br/></p>
<p>Die Box kommt vorkonfiguriert und ist sofort nach dem Einstöpseln einsatzbereit. Um zu einem anderen VPN Server zu wechseln, logge dich einfach über deinen Browser ins einfach zu bedienende Webinterface ein. Für Profieinstellungen (z.B. für Netzwerke mit festen IP Adressen), steht ein fortgeschrittenes Webinterface zur Verfügung.<br/></p>
<p><b>Wann bekomme ich meine Shellfire Box?</b><br/></p>
<p>Die Shellfire Box ist da! Alle Bestellungen werden an Werktagen innerhalb von 24h verschickt!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Kann ich meinen Shellfire VPN Account auch schon nutzen, bevor ich die Box bekomme?</b></p>
<p>Ja! Du kannst Shellfire VPN direkt nach der Bestellung auch ohne die Box schon schon auf deinem Computer oder Smartphone/Tablet installieren und nutzen.</p>
<p><b>Was sind die technischen Daten?</b><br/></p>
<p>Die Shellfire Box basiert auf Nexx WT3020 Router Hardware und läuft mit einer modifizierten openwrt Firmware.</p>

That's why we created Shellfire VPN, an easy to use app that safely connects your Windows, Mac OS or Android device to our encrypted vpn network with just a few clicks. We have already helped more than 200,000 users worldwide secure their data and overcome censorship.Why Is That Not Enough?If you own many devices, securing all of them can get annoying and most ""smart"" devices don't even offer the possibility to establish a 
safe vpn connection, leaving your data exposed. That's why, many of our 
users have asked us for a simple solution to secure all their devices at
 once.Thinking Outside the BoxIn an attempt to provide these people with a good solution, we came up with the idea of the Shellfire Box, a tiny box that safely connects all your devices at once to our worldwide vpn network in a matter of seconds:Unlimited ConnectivityWith the Shellfire Box, you can easily secure all your devices, even those that don't 
offer any vpn capabilities (smart tvs, gaming consoles, bluray players, 
set top boxes etc. ). This allows you to access blocked content and 
surf safely, no matter where in the world you are located.Be Anywhere, AnytimeWe have been providing vpn tunnels for 5 years. During that time, we built a world-wide network of servers in 20 countries which allows you to virtually travel almost anywhere in the world within seconds and access content that is restricted to certain countries like websites, tv shows and youtube videos. The Shellfire Box reliably hides your true location and ip address from anyone on the web!Plug And PlayOne big difference between the Shellfire Box and other products is that we are designing it for the average user that does not know much about online security and encryption. Once connected to the internet, it will configure and connect itself automatically, meaning it requires absolutely zero expert knowledge! An easy-to-use web interface will allow you to switch your vpn server anytime. But if you're a true nerd, don't worry, you're also invited to the party! Just switch to the advanced interface and you have the full power of linux network tools at your hands!No TricksLike all our client-side software, the firmware of the Shellfire Box will be published as open source and vpn connections are established using OpenVPN. According to German laws, we are not obliged to keep any traffic / ip logs, so we don't.The Box In The News Geeky GadgetsVentureBeatWhat Do I Get?- The Shellfire Box- A 1 or 2 year subscription to Shellfire VPN Premium Plus- Full access to our high-speed servers in 29 countries

FAQ

Who are you?
We are Florian and Max. Together, we have been running Shellfire for 
more than 12 years, providing different hosting services to the 
public.


Why are you doing this?
Because we believe that the internet should be a place of freedom while remaining a safe place for private data.
Do I need a Shellfire VPN subscription in order to use the Shellfire Box?
The Shellfire Box comes with a 1 or 2 year subscription, depending
 on your order (except if you choose the ""Returning Customer"" perk). However, the box will not become useless if you don't 
choose to extend your subscription after that period, you will simply be
 switched to our free vpn service, providing you with a limited download
 speed and server choice.
Is there a way to use Shellfire VPN without the Shellfire Box?
Of course! Visit https://www.shellfire.net/vpn/
 to download our free and easy to use apps for Windows, Mac OS and 
Android devices! Other devices running iOS, Linux etc. are also 
supported via 3rd party apps or by using OS-integrated vpn capabilities.
How is the Shellfire Box different from products like anonabox, invizbox etc.?
The Shellfire Box uses vpn (virtual private network) technology, establishing a fast connection to one of our vpn servers. Contrary
 to other vpn routers, the Shellfire  Box comes pre-configured and 
setting it up requires absolutely zero nerdy expert knowledge! :) Most
 similar products use the Tor network instead of vpn. While Tor is a 
great way to protect your privacy, connections are often painfully slow 
and it is not easily possible to unblock restricted content that is only
 available in certain countries.
How can I change the settings of the Shellfire Box?
The Box comes pre-configured and will be immediately ready for use 
after plugging it in. If you want to switch to another vpn server, just 
log in to our easy to use web-interface with your browser. For 
further settings (e.g. for fixed ip networks), an advanced interface 
will also be available.
When will I get my Shellfire Box?
The Shellfire Box is here! All orders will be shipped within 24h on working days!
Will I be able to use my Shellfire VPN Account already before I get my box?
Yes! You will be able to use your Shellfire VPN account on your computer, smartphone or tablet right after your order.
What are the specs?
The Shellfire Box is based on Nexx WT3020 router hardware and will run a modified openwrt OS.



System-On-Chip: MediaTek MT7620n


CPU Speed: 580MHz


RAM memory: 64 MB DDR


Wired network: 2 x Ethernet 100 Mbps (switched)


Ethernet chip: MediaTek MT7530 (SoC)


Ethernet switch: MediaTek MT7530 (integrated)


Wireless network: 2.4 GHz 802.11b/g/n MiMo 2x2:2


Wireless chip: MediaTek RT5390 (SoC)


Which vpn technology will the Shellfire Box be using?
We will be using OpenVPN with AES encryption, widely considered as one of the safest technologies around.
What download speeds should I expect?
We are still optimizing. Currently, we are reaching around 13 Mbit/s under perfect conditions. This is largely enough for streaming videos. We are still working on improving this figure but don't expect 50 Mbit/s, as encryption is pretty hardware intensive.
Are there more pictures/videos/details?
Check back here regularly as we will be releasing updates soon! Also, follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus to be the first ones to know when new stuff is available!

Does the Shellfire Box connect to OpenVPN servers of other providers?
This will definitely be possible for advanced users. However, it requires more technical skills than the regular setup of the Shellfire Box. Our focus with the Shellfire Box is on the easy and intuitive usage. Users of the box don't have to fiddle around with ip-addresses and certificates to go online securely, but only plug the box in and connect to its wifi.
Will I be able to connect to wireless hotspots using the Shellfire Box?
This will unfortunately not be possible as it would require a second wireless chip which our hardware does not have. It would also make setting up the box much more complicated. If you are on the go, you can just use our free apps for Windows, Mac OS or Android to connect your device directly to our servers without having to take the Shellfire Box with you.
Can I use my Shellfire VPN Account before I get the Shellfire Box?
Yes! When this campaign is over, we will activate your account so that you can use Shellfire VPN using our apps already before the Shellfire Box is shipped.
Is Shellfire VPN available for other devices as well?
Yes! We currently have apps for Windows, Mac OS and Android but other devices (linux, iOS etc.) can connect as well using 3rd party apps or using internal vpn capabilities of the OS. Let us know if you have any questions regarding your device!
How can I help the Shellfire Box become reality?
In order to support us, tweet and share this campaign on facebook
 or Google Plus! Also, obviously, the best support you can give us is by 
becoming a backer.

Deutsche Fassung

Über Shellfire
Wir glauben daran, dass ein freier und sicherer Zugang zum Internet für jeden Menschen auf dieser Welt ein Grundrecht ist. Deshalb haben wir Shellfire VPN entwickelt, eine einfache App, die dein WIndows, Mac OS oder Android Gerät mit wenigen Klicks sicher mit unserem weltweiten VPN Netz verbindet. Wir haben bereits über 200.000 Nutzern weltweit dabei geholfen, ihre Daten zu schützen und Zensur zu überwinden.
Warum Ist Das Nicht Genug?
Wenn du viele Geräte besitzt wird es irgendwann lästig, jedes Gerät einzeln abzusichern. Die meisten ""smarten"" Gerät bieten gar nicht die Möglichkeit, eine sichere VPN Verbindung aufzubauen und verschicken deine Daten somit ungeschützt. Deshalb haben uns viele unserer Nutzer nach einer Möglichkeit gefragt, all ihre Geräte auf einmal abzusichern.
Um Die Ecke Gedacht
Auf der Suche nach einer guten Lösung kamen wir auf die Idee, die Shellfire Box zu entwickeln. Eine kleine Box, die in wenigen Sekunden all deine Geräte gleichzeitig sicher mit unserem weltweiten VPN Netz verbindet:


Uneingeschränkte Konnektiviät
Mit der Shellfire Box kannst du ganz einfach all deine Geräte absichern, selbst solche, die keine VPN Verbindungen aufbauen können (Smart TVs, Spielekonsolen, Bluray Player, Set Top Boxen etc.). Dadurch kannst du auf blockierte Inhalte zugreifen und sicher surfen, ganz egal, wo auf der Welt du dich gerade befindest.
Sei Wo Du Willst, Wann Immer Du Möchtest
Wir hosten seit 5 Jahren VPN Tunnel. In dieser Zeit haben wir ein weltweites Netz mit Servern in 20 Ländern aufgebaut. Das erlaubt dir, in wenigen Sekunden deinen virtuellen Standort fast überall auf die Welt zu verlegen und somit Inhalte anzusehen, die in deinem Land eigentlich nicht verfügbar oder zensiert sind (Video Streams, TV Serien, Youtube Videos etc.). Die Shellfire Box verbirgt zuverlässig deinen tatsächlichen Standort und deine IP Adresse vor neugierigen Augen im Internet!
Plug And Play
Ein großer Unterschied zwischen der Shellfire Box und anderen Produkten ist, dass wir sie für den durchschnittlichen Internetnutzer designen, der nicht viel über Datensicherheit und Verschlüsselung weiß. Einmal mit dem Internet verbunden, konfiguriert sie sich selbst und verbindet sich automatisch. Das heißt, du brauchst absolut Null Expertenwissen, um die Shellfire Box zu nutzen! Ein simples Webinterface erlaubt es dir, jederzeit deinen VPN Server zu wechseln. Auch Nerds brauchen sich jedoch keine Sorgen zu machen. Aktiviere einfach das fortgeschrittene Interface und dir steht die volle Power von Linux Netzwerktools zur Verfügung!
Keine Tricks
Wie all unsere Clientsoftware, wird auch die Firmware der Shellfire Box als Open Source veröffentlicht und alle Verbindungen werden über OpenVPN hergestellt. Laut deutscher Gesetzgebung sind wir nicht zum führen von Daten- / IP-Logs verpflichtet, also tun wir es auch nicht.

FAQ



Wer seid ihr?
Wir sind Florian und Max. Zusammen betreiben wir Shellfire seit über 12 Jahren und haben in dieser Zeit verschiedene Hostingservices für Endverbraucher angeboten.


Warum macht ihr das alles?
Weil wir daran glauben, dass das Internet ein Ort der Freiheit und gleichzeitig ein sicherer Platz für private Daten sein sollte.
Brauche ich ein Shellfire VPN Abo, um die Shellfire Box zu nutzen?
Die Shellfire Box kommt inklusive 1 oder 2 Jahren Shellfire VPN PremiumPlus (es sei denn, du wählst den ""Returning Customer"" Perk). Wenn diese Zeit abläuft und du keine kostenpflichtige Verlängerung möchtest, wird die Shellfire Box jedoch nicht nutzlos. Du wirst in diesem Fall einfach auf unsere kostenlosen Server herabgestuft. Hier sind Downloadgeschwindigkeit und Serverauswahl beschränkt.
Kann man Shellfire VPN auch ohne Shellfire Box nutzen?
Natürlich! Besuche einfach https://www.shellfire.de/vpn/ , um unsere kostenlosen und einfachen Apps für Windows, Mac OS und Android Geräte herunterzuladen! Andere Geräte, auf denen iOS, Linux etc. läuft, werden über Drittanbietersoftware oder im Betriebssystem integrierte VPN Clients unterstützt.

office desk lamps, we came upon a (rather disappointing really) fact:
although there were some extraordinary modern lamps “out there”, extremely
stylish and full of features, there was no affordable and trusted way to
acquire them.</span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Actually, our search bore more fruits than
we expected: table lamps solutions perfect for every modern living- &amp;
work-space, be it a bedroom, an office or a hotel room. We discovered mass producers
of high-quality, low-consumption, eco-friendly LED lamps, which can vary their
lighting depending on our needs, and allow us to charge our mobile devices on
the same time!</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So, the idea of iLux was born: to establish
an e-shop and bring the average European (at least) consumer closer to such
state-of-the-art lighting solutions. To make it easy to find, explore, and buy
modern lamps at low prices, without the fuss of import costs, long transport
times and from dubious wholesale resellers. We started searching for a site
like ilux, and we ended up developing such a site ourselves for the rest of the world. </span></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: right;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430698/files/20140313070139-dooffy_design_icons_EU_flags_Greece.png?1394719299"" src="""" style=""""/> </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430700/files/20140313070208-dooffy_design_icons_EU_flags_Cyprus.png?1394719328"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""><a href=""http://iluxgr.blogspot.gr/2014/07/ilux-indiegogo.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See the Greek version here &gt;&gt;</a></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430571/files/20140313052311-divider2_whatisilux.jpg?1394713391"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""/><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal;"">iLux is a start-up Company, aiming at

Smart Desk Lamps’ Capabilities and Advantages:</b></p>
<p></p><ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">All iLux Lamps
facilitate smartphone charging while you are working or resting: either through
a USB port, or by acting as Smartphone docking stations for the most popular
smartphones on the market – including iPhone 4 and 5, and all Android phones.</span><br/>

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The LED lamp colour output can run the
whole gamut of “white” light colour, from “warm white” at Correlated Colour
Temperature (CCT) of 2700K (Kelvin degrees), up to CCT of 6500K, emulating
daylight.  Also, the light brightness can
vary from a low 60 Lux to a full 1000 Lux Bright.</span><br/>

<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">These particular LED Lamps are so
technologically advanced, that they achieve over 90 on the CRI (Colour
Rendering Index), regarding the fidelity in portraying Colours as they really
are – a value normally reserved for natural sunlight.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"">The 
27 LED Lamp is covered with state-of-the-art Diffuser Lens. Looking directly at the desk lamp by mistake while working or
reading will no longer produce any glare effect or “white spots” for your eyes.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"">On the other hand, the lamp works at a
power input of barely 11 Watts, making it up to 60% more energy efficient as
compared to relevant fluorescent desk lamps. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"">In particular, the offered Brightness can
be compared with the output of a 100W Incandescent bulb, a 40W Fluorescent bulb
or a 20W CFL. But the iLux lamps not only offer huge energy savings in
comparison with these lamps, but also have nil flickering (as opposed to the
60Hz of Incandescent and Fluorescent bulbs and 35Hz of CFL) and can last 10
times more, for a lifetime of 50,000 hours (as opposed to the expected 1,000
hours of a normal bulb and the 5,000 hours of Fluorescent bulbs).</span><br/>

Smart Desk Lamps’ Features analysed:</b></p>
<p></p><ul><li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With just a
touch on the pad, iLUX Desk Lamps can be switched between four (4) different
modes of operation, according to the situation at hand and concurrent user
needs. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"">The four preset
Modes take adventage of the lamp’s versatility and change the LED Lamp colour and
brightness level to the proper values best suited to either Read Mode, Study
Mode, Relax Mode, or Sleep (night) Mode:</span>
</li></ul><span style=""background-color: initial;""><ol style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"">Read Mode: a
natural, brighter White light at a temperature of 4,300K to 5,300K, suitable
for easy reading, memorising, computer input, taking notes, and related desk
work.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"">Study Mode: an
intense, cool White colour at a temperature of 6,000K to 7,000K, emulating
daylight, therefore best suited to concentration, focusing and studying.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"">Relax Mode: a
cosier, warmer White light at a temperature around 3,000K, with the familiar
soft glow of indoors lighting, just right for relaxation, light reading and
good company.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"">Sleep Mode: a
variation of warm White light at 2,700-3,000K but at a much lower brightness,
suitable as a night light or for a bit of reading in bed.</span><br/>

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Each Lamp stand
is designed to facilitate Smartphone charging. You can charge your device
either through an included USB port, or –depending on the model- on the
dedicated Smartphone charging docks for the most popular Smartphones on the
market: Apple iPhone 4, iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy series, HTC, Sony and all
Android smartphones (microUSB port).  The
Lamps act as charging docks through seamless and innovative design. </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;"">Note however,
that the USB charging is best suited for smartphones, and not for larger mobile
devices like iPads, since its output does not exceed 700mA - they will charge, but very slowly.</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; background-color: initial;""> </span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">User control
through an elegant LED touch panel, with one-touch power on/off, timer set, 4
modes control and brightness level slider.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">9 steps of lamp
brightness (5 steps in iLUX LL01), through a slide touch control. Depending on
the Mode (Sleep, Relax, Study, Read), brightness can be set through the touch
slider to vary from a mere 60 lux (for night Sleep mode) to an impressive 1000
lux (to read or study modes). </span></li>

and as with any venture, risks are involved. In order for this project to
succeed, and for iLux to become a reality, we have tried to identify and take
measures for a number of risks:</p>
<p><b><i>Overall management issues</i></b> - <i>the project may
fund, but we may mismanage the funds or never launch the eshop</i>: we
can only point out to our extensive managerial experience in business, and the
fact that we have already been working in the field of wholesale for over 25 years now.
We have a healthy business model, a valid fund allocation with room for
overhead, and we have already planned all the next steps, like finding a
hosting provider, securing the domain name and testing various software.</p>
<p><b><i>The project may not fund</i></b>: we have already accounted for this probability, and while we may reconsider the eshop idea, our
supporters <u>will get their rewards no matter what</u>, even if the project relies on “flexible”
founding.</p>
<p><b><i>Delays</i></b>: Regarding the reward delivery
times, the only delays lie on the supplier, as we do not produce locally. To
counter this, we have selected a trustworthy supplier, and we have already ordered
many sample products to gauge delivery times. Also, the supplier has huge stock
of all the lamps we plan to give as rewards, although the delivery times given on
the rewards take into account the worst case scenario of producing from the
scratch. Even so, to further tackle shipping delays, we plan on posting orders
before the campaign is over, if we have a big enough quantity of orders. As for
shipping delays, we have more than 20 years in import and export experience of
goods, having faced every possible problems with customs, carriers, shipping
methods, logistics, accounting and strict project deadlines – therefore we <i>will
</i>send them in time!</p>
<p>Regarding the final iLux launch, we have
already taken steps to secure hosting and domain name for the site, so it will
launch as soon as we build the appropriate platform.</p><p><b><i>Product quality</i></b>: since we do not produce the lamps ourselves in order to run quality assurance, we have ordered <u>six </u>different samples, and <i>tested them thoroughly for 6 months now</i>, to be sure of their quality - and they have performed admirably. However, all the lamps have 1 year guarantee.</p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/430657/files/20140313064001-divider9_extrahelp.jpg?1394718001"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>You may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can’t help us create iLux! </p><p></p><ul>

<p></p><p></p></div>","A few months ago, while searching for new
office desk lamps, we came upon a (rather disappointing really) fact:
although there were some extraordinary modern lamps “out there”, extremely
stylish and full of features, there was no affordable and trusted way to
acquire them.
Actually, our search bore more fruits than
we expected: table lamps solutions perfect for every modern living- &
work-space, be it a bedroom, an office or a hotel room. We discovered mass producers
of high-quality, low-consumption, eco-friendly LED lamps, which can vary their
lighting depending on our needs, and allow us to charge our mobile devices on
the same time!
So, the idea of iLux was born: to establish
an e-shop and bring the average European (at least) consumer closer to such
state-of-the-art lighting solutions. To make it easy to find, explore, and buy
modern lamps at low prices, without the fuss of import costs, long transport
times and from dubious wholesale resellers. We started searching for a site
like ilux, and we ended up developing such a site ourselves for the rest of the world.   See the Greek version here >>iLux is a start-up Company, aiming at
bringing innovative Lighting technologies to the mass market of Greece, Europe, and beyond. Our purpose: locate noteworthy advancements in the world lighting industry and
make them available at reduced prices to the European consumer. We are not interested in all forms
of lamps or lighting technology – iLux focuses on smart, innovative and
energy-saving solutions, which work in harmony with other household appliances.
As a matter of hand, we are especially proud of our
first choice in a product line, the iLux Smart Lamps. The Smart Desk Lamp
line completely embodies iLux philosophy, as they are lighting products designed
to promote quality of life and increase work production. We had the idea, and now we need your
contribution to kick off this venture. Your support will ensure the necessary
funds, not only to design and build iLux as an appropriate e-commerce platform,
but also to make our first extensive wholesale order of Smart Desk Lamps. 
Moreover, this campaign will act as an
unofficial poll, to let us know if people are actually interested in what we
consider super cool –that is, smart lamps- and if so, towards which particular
models they gravitate. 
Last but not least – we want people to HELP
us make iLux into the e-shop they always wanted. We want suggestions, criticism,
user input, beta testing – anything that can make iLux better.We introduce the European and world market
to “Smart” Desk Lamps - that is, desk lamps which epitomize everything the
contemporary user has come to expect from his or her appliances. 
The iLUX Desk Lamps line is based on
eco-friendly, high-output LED Lighting, utilizing modern technological advances.

Features include touch panel controls,
level of brightness adjustment, variation of modes depending on the current use
(reading, studying, relaxing, or sleeping), smart phone charging and docking, multi-pivot
flexible positioning to cover every area of a desk (or to fold in an
unobtrusive position when not needed). In short, a “smart” desk lamp, able to
correspond to its users’ needs. 
All in the form of an elegant, sleek design
with a premium finish, exhibiting an impressive built quality.

Smart Desk Lamps’ Capabilities and Advantages:

All iLux Lamps
facilitate smartphone charging while you are working or resting: either through
a USB port, or by acting as Smartphone docking stations for the most popular
smartphones on the market – including iPhone 4 and 5, and all Android phones.

The LED lamp colour output can run the
whole gamut of “white” light colour, from “warm white” at Correlated Colour
Temperature (CCT) of 2700K (Kelvin degrees), up to CCT of 6500K, emulating
daylight.  Also, the light brightness can
vary from a low 60 Lux to a full 1000 Lux Bright.


These particular LED Lamps are so
technologically advanced, that they achieve over 90 on the CRI (Colour
Rendering Index), regarding the fidelity in portraying Colours as they really
are – a value normally reserved for natural sunlight.


The 
27 LED Lamp is covered with state-of-the-art Diffuser Lens. Looking directly at the desk lamp by mistake while working or
reading will no longer produce any glare effect or “white spots” for your eyes.


On the other hand, the lamp works at a
power input of barely 11 Watts, making it up to 60% more energy efficient as
compared to relevant fluorescent desk lamps. In particular, the offered Brightness can
be compared with the output of a 100W Incandescent bulb, a 40W Fluorescent bulb
or a 20W CFL. But the iLux lamps not only offer huge energy savings in
comparison with these lamps, but also have nil flickering (as opposed to the
60Hz of Incandescent and Fluorescent bulbs and 35Hz of CFL) and can last 10
times more, for a lifetime of 50,000 hours (as opposed to the expected 1,000
hours of a normal bulb and the 5,000 hours of Fluorescent bulbs).


iLUX
Smart Desk Lamps’ Features analysed:

With just a
touch on the pad, iLUX Desk Lamps can be switched between four (4) different
modes of operation, according to the situation at hand and concurrent user
needs. The four preset
Modes take adventage of the lamp’s versatility and change the LED Lamp colour and
brightness level to the proper values best suited to either Read Mode, Study
Mode, Relax Mode, or Sleep (night) Mode:


Read Mode: a
natural, brighter White light at a temperature of 4,300K to 5,300K, suitable
for easy reading, memorising, computer input, taking notes, and related desk
work.


Study Mode: an
intense, cool White colour at a temperature of 6,000K to 7,000K, emulating
daylight, therefore best suited to concentration, focusing and studying.


Relax Mode: a
cosier, warmer White light at a temperature around 3,000K, with the familiar
soft glow of indoors lighting, just right for relaxation, light reading and
good company.


Sleep Mode: a
variation of warm White light at 2,700-3,000K but at a much lower brightness,
suitable as a night light or for a bit of reading in bed.







Each Lamp stand
is designed to facilitate Smartphone charging. You can charge your device
either through an included USB port, or –depending on the model- on the
dedicated Smartphone charging docks for the most popular Smartphones on the
market: Apple iPhone 4, iPhone 5, Samsung Galaxy series, HTC, Sony and all
Android smartphones (microUSB port).  The
Lamps act as charging docks through seamless and innovative design. Note however,
that the USB charging is best suited for smartphones, and not for larger mobile
devices like iPads, since its output does not exceed 700mA - they will charge, but very slowly. 


User control
through an elegant LED touch panel, with one-touch power on/off, timer set, 4
modes control and brightness level slider.

9 steps of lamp
brightness (5 steps in iLUX LL01), through a slide touch control. Depending on
the Mode (Sleep, Relax, Study, Read), brightness can be set through the touch
slider to vary from a mere 60 lux (for night Sleep mode) to an impressive 1000
lux (to read or study modes). 

The Timer
selection on the LED Panel will turn off the lamp automatically after 60
minutes – works great with the Sleep mode during night time, as the lamp will shut down by itself if you fall asleep!

Being an executive manager for a prominent producer of architectural lighting features, she has over 20 years of experience both in the fields of lighting and business management. Her expertise lies in importing and exporting wholesale goods, invaluable for the fulfillment part of this campaign, as well as the logistics of iLux.grGeorge is an engineer, and also dabbles in website development. He will be the administrator of iLux.gr running the everyday support of the eshop. He is also the crowdfunding “fanboy” behind the campaign, as he has contributed in 14 campaigns on IndieGogo and supported over 130 campaigns at Kickstarter. His experiences –good and bad- with other campaigns ensure that most things will run smoothly before, during and after this one.Funds allocation chart:The project funding will allow iLux to commence its business with the first series of products. We have already secured our domain name (www.ilux.gr), and have ordered multiple samples from the desk lamp manufacturer, which we have tested thoroughly for more than 5 months (!). Now it’s time to ask for your contribution. On the other hand, it's also time to give our future customers from Greece, Europe and all over the world, the chance to participate in formulating out first batch of imports, and be the first to get our iLUX lamps at extremely competitive pricing (check out our Perks!).This project regards starting a business –
and as with any venture, risks are involved. In order for this project to
succeed, and for iLux to become a reality, we have tried to identify and take
measures for a number of risks:
Overall management issues - the project may
fund, but we may mismanage the funds or never launch the eshop: we
can only point out to our extensive managerial experience in business, and the
fact that we have already been working in the field of wholesale for over 25 years now.
We have a healthy business model, a valid fund allocation with room for
overhead, and we have already planned all the next steps, like finding a
hosting provider, securing the domain name and testing various software.
The project may not fund: we have already accounted for this probability, and while we may reconsider the eshop idea, our
supporters will get their rewards no matter what, even if the project relies on “flexible”
founding.
Delays: Regarding the reward delivery
times, the only delays lie on the supplier, as we do not produce locally. To
counter this, we have selected a trustworthy supplier, and we have already ordered
many sample products to gauge delivery times. Also, the supplier has huge stock
of all the lamps we plan to give as rewards, although the delivery times given on
the rewards take into account the worst case scenario of producing from the
scratch. Even so, to further tackle shipping delays, we plan on posting orders
before the campaign is over, if we have a big enough quantity of orders. As for
shipping delays, we have more than 20 years in import and export experience of
goods, having faced every possible problems with customs, carriers, shipping
methods, logistics, accounting and strict project deadlines – therefore we will
send them in time!
Regarding the final iLux launch, we have
already taken steps to secure hosting and domain name for the site, so it will
launch as soon as we build the appropriate platform.Product quality: since we do not produce the lamps ourselves in order to run quality assurance, we have ordered six different samples, and tested them thoroughly for 6 months now, to be sure of their quality - and they have performed admirably. However, all the lamps have 1 year guarantee.You may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can’t help us create iLux!

Each brick contains a powerful LED. You can use them to build imaginative light creations and you can also use them to light up your own collection of building blocks. LIGHT STAX comes in a wide range of both solid and transparent colors. They work without wires and have multiple lighting modes, but it can also be used with extension cables. Just imagine the possibilities!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468315925/rxegqltxr7jfm51dgno0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468316652/v78ndlf3sbypttdewwlt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>LIGHT STAX come to life when you build them onto Power STAX. It may look like a regular 2x4 brick but... look again! It has a micro USB connector and a small switch on the side. Plug in a USB cable and connect it to your smart phone adapter, laptop or power bank. LIGHT STAX has 3 light options: instant on, blinking or glowing. But there is more! In this wireless world we wanted to get rid of cables so we designed a cute little 4x4 stud Lithium Polymer brick. One of these battery bricks will light a STAX for almost 50 hours and can be recharged over and over again. No need for batteries! You can build with LIGHT STAX any way you like. No matter how many studs you connect, the bricks will pass on the light. We offer extension cables as well to reach far and hidden places.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/623/928/1787466faf4bfdc3e69699e4ff5a0f59_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1464954918&amp;q=92&amp;s=d6931d92de6015e07683fd9984d5f6e3"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468316670/jjc4nzn0qvhq1idhgegx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>LIGHT STAX is part of the STAX system family and will continue to surprise.

Each brick contains a powerful LED. You can use them to build imaginative light creations and you can also use them to light up your own collection of building blocks. LIGHT STAX comes in a wide range of both solid and transparent colors. They work without wires and have multiple lighting modes, but it can also be used with extension cables. Just imagine the possibilities!LIGHT STAX come to life when you build them onto Power STAX. It may look like a regular 2x4 brick but... look again! It has a micro USB connector and a small switch on the side. Plug in a USB cable and connect it to your smart phone adapter, laptop or power bank. LIGHT STAX has 3 light options: instant on, blinking or glowing. But there is more! In this wireless world we wanted to get rid of cables so we designed a cute little 4x4 stud Lithium Polymer brick. One of these battery bricks will light a STAX for almost 50 hours and can be recharged over and over again. No need for batteries! You can build with LIGHT STAX any way you like. No matter how many studs you connect, the bricks will pass on the light. We offer extension cables as well to reach far and hidden places.LIGHT STAX is part of the STAX system family and will continue to surprise. The first born was a bigger version of LIGHT STAX (JUNIOR). They were launched in 2014 as LED building bricks on DUPLO® scale. The new smaller offspring will include exciting items like SOUND STAX, SENSOR STAX, MOTOR STAX and more. All of these will become available as fully compatible 2x4 and 4x4 stud bricks. We may also develop other LIGHT STAX brick sizes. Let us know what kind of LIGHT STAX you would like to see as we take your feedback very seriously!The first in line after LIGHT STAX, will be the SOUND STAX. With SOUND STAX you can record and play real sounds. So, do you want to have a brick dog that barks like your own, a brick car with the sound of a real Ferrari or a brick figure that sounds like your biggest hero? Then hop on the STAX train and extend your brick world.

This is where Arno from Brandtraders in the Netherlands meets Johnny for the first time. They share a passion for LEGO and toy innovation. Thomas from Abanico in Germany, being a friend of Johnny, is asked to help getting LIGHT STAX onto the European market.In 2014 Johnny, Thomas, Stefan (also from Abanico) and Arno find each other in preparing a launch in Europe. Finally...the market release of LIGHT STAX JUNIOR!In 2015 and 2016 the team from Taiwan, Germany and the Netherlands works even more closely together to get the new LEGO® scale LIGHT STAX ready. So, here we are!  The original bigger size LIGHT STAX (now usually referred to as LIGHT STAX JUNIOR) already received numerous awards that we are proud of. It’s been a New York Toy Fair favorite and it was nominated Best of Toy Fair. Last year the awards just kept coming in. We think that the new brick scale LIGHT STAX may be an even bigger prize winner! LEGO® and DUPLO® are trademarks of the LEGO Group of companies which does not sponsor, authorize or endorse Indiegogo or this project.",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our servers act as middlemen that hide your IP address from the websites you visit and the services you use.“I don’t have anything to hide”As I've debated this issue around the world, every single time somebody has said to me, 'I don't really worry about invasions of privacy because I don't have anything to hide,' I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen. I write down my email address. I say, 'Here's my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts, not just the nice, respectable work one in your name, but all of them, because I want to be able to just troll through what it is you're doing online, read what I want to read and publish whatever I find interesting. After all, if you're not a bad person, if you're doing nothing wrong, you should have nothing to hide.' Not a single person has taken me up on that offer. I check that email account religiously all the time. It's a very desolate place.”-Glenn GreenwaldWe believe you shouldn’t have to trade privacy and security for a great user experience. We’ve been working for the past year to integrate our VPN and Flter so that they work seamlessly together. We offer full peer to peer support and unlimited bandwidth. We have servers in over 20 countries to provide near-instant connection and fast speeds. You’ll never notice it’s there. Our service also includes Tor bridge relay and socks5 proxy. Every reward tier comes with a year of our VPN service. You can use our VPN with Flter and on any of your devices while not at home.We want to emphasize the fact that we don’t keep any logs on user web activity and all of the traffic through our network is encrypted. Read about our stance on privacy.Flter does however support OpenVPN, OpenConnect, L2TP/IPsec if you prefer to use your own VPN service.Flter maintains lists of malicious websites, harmful ad networks, trackers, malware, and telemetry services. Flter automatically blocks any incoming connections these services try to make. Infected advertising is a huge threat, but with Flter you’ll never see a malicious ad again. You can create your own lists or whitelist sites to support your favorite content providers. Parents can also create their own lists if they wish to block certain websites from their family network. For ease of use all block lists and security features are kept up to date automatically. You can turn this off at anytime. The Flter app for iOS and Android, and the web interface, allows you to switch between connection modes or configure more advanced settings. Flter couldn’t be easier to set up. Flter works with any router/modem. To run all of your network traffic through Flter, connect it between your modem and router. Plug in the power and you’re all set, Flter will start working automatically and can be configured within the app. To connect to Flter as a separate WiFi access point plug Flter into an ethernet-out port of your router or modem. For easy VPN protection switch between your home router’s WiFi and Flter’s. In relay mode Flter can connect to your home WiFi and extend the range for a stronger WiFi signal.Once connected you can operate Flter entirely from the app or web interface. Touch the slider and Flter will automatically connect to the closest region. If you want to connect to a specific region to get around geographic restrictions select the region of choice. Flter will connect all of your devices to the selected region. Founded in 2015, our company consists of four talented and passionate team members all with the same vision: providing people with peace-of-mind and security on the internet. As we began digging deeper into problems linked with data collection the primary challenge we tackled was how to make privacy and security simple and protect all internet connected devices. Read more about us here.We have a great idea, and a great team working to make Flter the best it can be, but we need your help. With your support we’ll be able to bring Flter to market and make it available for everyone. We are raising $50,000 to meet manufacturing requirements and volume in order to mass produce Flter and make it affordable. We have suppliers and manufactures in Shenzhen China ready to start production, all we need is you.Together, we can make Flter a reality. With your support, we truly believe we can achieve our goal, to make your online experience, yours again.Pictures of our manufacturer in Shenzhen China:FAQ Do you allow peer-to-peer torrenting? Yes, you can download torrents on every single server! Can I use other VPN providers with my Flter device? Yes you can! Flter supports OpenVPN andL2TP/IPsec if you prefer to use your own VPN service. Will your lifetime VPN subscription be available later?Unfortunately not, the lifetime tier is a special promotion that will not be available for much longer. What are Flter's specs? Power: DC 5v/1.2A, Data Transfer: (direct up to 100mbps) (VPN up to 30mbps), WiFi: 802.11n 2.4Ghz, Coverage: 900 square feet. Have more questions? Please email us at hello@flter.me  Risks and challengesCoordinating with manufacturers to bring Flter from prototype to production may be challenging. We have prepared for this by speaking with the manufacturing companies we will be using ahead of time to get a clear idea of what the process will be like so most potential issues have already been assessed. Building computer hardware comes with it’s own inherent risks but we have a ready-to-use mould and our suppliers have already been pre-selected. This guarantees we can stick to our planned timeline.For our backers that require overseas shipping, we promise to deal with international customs in advance so as to provide you with a clear idea of when you will receive your product.Being clear and precise with our supporters and backers is important to us. We strive to provide top-notch customer service, so please feel free to reach out to us about any concerns you may have and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

<p>Hello, my name is John Drake. My professional background is in Marine Design and Construction, but one of my great passions is for Renewable Energy.</p>
<p>I have invented a device to create Clean Renewable Energy from Waves in the Ocean.</p>
<p>My design is particularly ground breaking and unique, in that it also seeks to combine Wave Energy with the existing technology of Offshore Wind Farms, which are becoming increasingly common throughout Europe at present.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why Wave Energy:-</span></strong></p>
<p>The Surface of Planet Earth is covered by roughly two thirds in water. All of Australia’s Capital Cities are located close to the coast, as are the great majority of the Worlds Capital Cities. Humans are by their very nature a coastal dwelling species. It makes sense therefore that given the vastness of our coastlines, and our proximity to them that humans should be utilising some of the tremendous energy that is available for use within our oceans for electrical generation.</p>
<p>The idea of harvesting of Wave Energy and Tidal Energy is not a new concept. There are patents for Wave Energy Harvesting devices that date as far back as 1901.</p>
<p>However, despite the enormous potential, a great many of the Wave Energy devices created over the last century were never realised, and of those that did succeed none have so far been successfully harvested on a large scale. It is therefore still the largest untapped source of free natural energy that mankind has available to it.</p>
<p>At Ocean Wave Technology, we see the enormous potential for Wave Energy generation on a worldwide scale, and with our unique WaveTech1 Wave Energy Harvesting device, along with the great marketing opportunity that the Offshore Wind Industry is already bringing; we believe we have the product to be able to break through with Wave Energy on a worldwide scale.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A brief description of how the device works:-</span></strong></p>
<p>Briefly, we can reveal here that the design involves a platform floating at water level. This platform is able to rotate 360 degrees around the base of an Offshore Wind Tower.</p>
<p>The platform consists of 4 hulls, 2 outer hulls, and 2 inner hulls. In between these hulls there are a total of 12 vertical cylinders, these are suspended in between the hulls, with the water flowing between the hulls, and into each cylinder.</p>
<p>These cylinders operate as a series of pumps, which when driven by the up and down motion of passing waves, work to suck in seawater. This sea water is then directed along a manifold pipe at pressure, and into a turbine, which then turns a generator to produce an electrical current.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What is unique, new and different about our Wave Energy design?:-</span></strong></p>
<p>Aside from our unique ability to be directly coupled to new and existing Offshore Wind infrastructure, our device has a number of other unique features, these unique features are listed in brief below:-</p>
<p>-       A compact platform style design, thus reducing the area of sea floor required to produce electrical energy.</p>
<p>-          Powerful water driven pump and turbine style design.</p>
<p>-          Features a variety of variable individual shut down mechanisms, so as to better control the input of energy into the system, and thus better regulate the output.</p>
<p>-          Unique 360 degree rotation platform design, ensures the platform will always face onto the oncoming swell.</p>
<p>-          Unique tidal adjustment mechanism ensures the platform will always be floating at the optimum position to produce the optimum electrical energy output.</p>
<p>-          Storm event survivability, with a full emergency storm shutdown capability.</p>
<p>Additional details of these unique advantages are further detailed within the attached document:- An Outline of Ocean Wave Technology.pd</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What our immediate financial needs are:-</span></strong></p>
<p>I order to demonstrate the technological capabilities of the design; I will need to make a scaled demonstration model. However, this will be quite expensive, and I have very little personal funds available.</p>
<p>I have received approximate quotes for manufacturing one of the Wave Cylinders at 1:10 scale to test the design. The costs for the manufacture of this are as follows:-</p>

<p>If you would like to contribute financially to Ocean Wave Technology’s campaign, we have set up a Pay Pal account. The details of both of which are available upon this site.</p>

<p>We would like to request, that we would much prefer that contributors use the Pay Pal account for making their contributions. The reason for this is simple, in that contributions to the Pay Pal account will be deposited to our account instantly, thereby giving us the funding we need to pay for our expense items as we proceed, rather than having to wait all the way till the end of the 60 day campaign to receive the funds, as is the case for the other payment options.  </p>

We are looking to begin production in October and aim to ship products in November. At this stage, time could be our biggest challenge due to the uncertainty brought on by the global pandemic which can both, directly and indirectly, affect our production and shipping times. To prepare for this challenge, we have worked closely with our suppliers to mitigate the impact as much as possible. We will also keep backers updated about unexpected circumstances.",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Qube finds that smart home products are too expensive now. Our team put together Qube to be an affordable platform for both end-users and developers to start their first smart home journey. </p>
<p>Qube smart home products have been designed and prototyped in Singapore, China and in San Francisco. We have already very strong and established manufacturing partners based in Singapore &amp; Shenzhen. We are very excited to have created our own version of Qube Light Strips.  </p>
<p>While completing our first batch of 500 units of 1st batch manufacturing, we are ready to move into mass production. This project aims to collate enough orders to lower our cost enough to make the light strips affordable for the mass market launch.

<p><b>The Tech - How does it work?</b></p>
<p>Every Qube Light Strip adapter has an inbuilt Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Smart 4.0 Chip –  making it constantly connected. We built a software layer that allows all Qube bulbs to communicate with one another and auto selecting the optimal bulb/s to act as a hub while serving its primary purpose of smart illumination. This feature is unique to Qube. The built-in Wi-Fi allows maximum connection stability and range.</p>
<div>Qube works with your iOS, Android phones, and your iWatch to allow you the optimal control of your lightings from your phone. Android wearable app will complete by Q2 this year. </div>
<p>The combination of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips within Qube also allows it to sense users within the home via our Qube Sense™ technology and carry out meaningful automation when you are near to the proximity of the bulb.</p>
<p><b>How long are the Lightstrips in the starter kit set and the extension set?</b><br/>LightStrip Starter Kit ~ 2 meters<br/>LightStrip Extension ~ 1 meter</p>
<p><b>How does it save energy and the earth?</b></p>
<p>Millions of Watts are wasted each day. Qube technology does not only automatically switch off lights when unused, it also monitors usage and keeps your home 'Green.' It also allows you to adjust your lights to optimum brightness and control them at the tap of a finger. In turn, this helps you to save on your electrical bills.</p>
<p><b>How do I set it up?</b></p>

Qube finds that smart home products are too expensive now. Our team put together Qube to be an affordable platform for both end-users and developers to start their first smart home journey. 
Qube smart home products have been designed and prototyped in Singapore, China and in San Francisco. We have already very strong and established manufacturing partners based in Singapore & Shenzhen. We are very excited to have created our own version of Qube Light Strips.  
While completing our first batch of 500 units of 1st batch manufacturing, we are ready to move into mass production. This project aims to collate enough orders to lower our cost enough to make the light strips affordable for the mass market launch. Similar to Qube Smart Bulb, we target to launch our light strip and making them affordable for everyone and we need your help.

The Tech - How does it work?
Every Qube Light Strip adapter has an inbuilt Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Smart 4.0 Chip –  making it constantly connected. We built a software layer that allows all Qube bulbs to communicate with one another and auto selecting the optimal bulb/s to act as a hub while serving its primary purpose of smart illumination. This feature is unique to Qube. The built-in Wi-Fi allows maximum connection stability and range.
Qube works with your iOS, Android phones, and your iWatch to allow you the optimal control of your lightings from your phone. Android wearable app will complete by Q2 this year. 
The combination of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips within Qube also allows it to sense users within the home via our Qube Sense™ technology and carry out meaningful automation when you are near to the proximity of the bulb.

Millions of Watts are wasted each day. Qube technology does not only automatically switch off lights when unused, it also monitors usage and keeps your home 'Green.' It also allows you to adjust your lights to optimum brightness and control them at the tap of a finger. In turn, this helps you to save on your electrical bills.

<p>I would like to introduce you to the Kovach Children.  They are missionary Children to Brazil, South America.  They moved to Brazil a little over a year ago, and the older children have already been helping to reach Brazilians for Jesus Christ.  When our family moved to Brazil, it was probably one of the hardest things we have done, but yet, as a father, it was such a joyous thing for me to see my children so selflessly surrender all to serve God in another country.  While traveling and preparing to serve in Brazil, our children never truly had much as we were always on the move.  None-the-less, when the final preparations were made, I can’t truly express the emotions of my heart as I saw my children willingly sell and give away what toys they had to charity.  My heart felt joy to see their level of commitment, even at their young age, to Christ.  At the same time, I felt sorrow for them as they gave away many of their cherished possessions and heartache as the younger children, who did not understand, ran down the sidewalk, crying, as they watched a prized possession given away.  This year, I would like to give my each of my seven children at least one nice present for Christmas, but I need your help.  Being servants on a foreign field often means that we are very tight financially, without extra for things like presents.  We will and always do keep Christ the center of Christmas, but at the same time, as a father, I would like for them to be able to have just a little something at Christmas time and to not have only memories of hardships in a foreign country where Christmas is barely acknowledged.  Often, children are the forgotten ones of Ministry and it is my desire to make this their first “real” Christmas here in Brazil and to ask if you would be willing to help, even just a little…</p>

Its pure silver inner was born with the ability to disinfect water to guarantee a healthy drinking experience for you. Its royal deluxe color and fine texture makes the Ag+ cup extremely captivating; you’d want it at a single peek.  Inspiration from the bluer than bluer hueThe story began with my first encounter with Yves Klein. His unique style of art became an inspiration to many pop artists. Klein had a special liking for blue, which became his preferred signature color. His celebrated bluer-than-blue hue would be recognized as the International Klein Blue (IKB).The French art-guru lived for only 34 years, spending eight years on his career. Yet, the impact he left with his ground-breaking ""Klein Blue"" discovery, has made him quite famous for over half of the century. Klein’s impact is still felt in the world of art with his popularity still unmatched. Its extraordinary, charming and challenging color, has evolved and become diversified in different areas such as fashion, art, architecture.   As a potter and fan of Yves Klein, I have always considered applying such amazing color on my ceramics works. The process was a huge challenge and no one had done it before, but I strongly believed their integration would be a revolutionary artwork.

ALVI media are up to 4x less restrictive, last up to 2x longer, and capture particles that are 40x smaller than standard MERV rated filters.What ALVI Users Have To Say.  0.3-0.5 Micron Performance.ALVI’s performance was tested @ 300fpm @ 0.3 - 0.5 microns in a 2500 cu. ft. clean room built to ANSI/AHAM standards against a HEPA filter & 1” pleated filter. Over a 2-hour period ALVI was able to significantly out performed the standard filter and provide HEPA class performance. 0.007 Micron Performance.At the 0.007 micron range. ALVI was able to significantly outperform both the HEPA & standard filter at removing micro-particulate.Tested. Certified. Approved.  Where ALVI Goes. ALVI is made in over 50 sizes.   What's In The Box?  ALVI App Upcoming Features.Our next planned update for the ALVI app will allow homeowners to monitor filter performance data & air quality insights via their connected devices.

<p>Sud Stud is made with anti-bacterial medical-grade silicone that's BPA free, safe for dishwashers, and designed to help your soap dry quickly in between uses.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><font color=""#0098d4""><span style=""font-size: 26px;""><b>Medical-Grade Antibacterial Silicone</b></span></font></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;color:#333333;"">Unlike traditional loofahs and poofs, Sud Stud is antibacterial and eliminates bacteria build-up often caused in humid environments.</span></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0255/1250/9512/files/hand-washing.gif?v=1596594513"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>By design, silicone is naturally anti-bacterial. As a completely <i>""sealed""</i> surface, water cannot enter silicone where bacteria and mold can grow over time. This helps keep Sud Stud germ free over time. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><font color=""#0098d4""><span style=""font-size: 26px;""><b>Optimized Drain for Quick Drying</b></span></font></strong></p>
<p><font color=""#333333""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">When not in use, Sud Stud V2 can be easily hung, draining excess water to help your soap last when not in use.</span></font></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0255/1250/9512/files/hang-to-dry.gif?v=1596594920"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>When not in use, hang Sud Stud with it’s re-engineered tie-hole. This ensures your Sud Stud hangs to dry with drain holes on the bottom of your Sud Stud, which are small enough to keep slivers of soap inside.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><span style=""font-size:26px;""><span style=""color:#0098D4;"">Easy to Clean and Sanitize</span></span></strong></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;color:#333333;"">Thanks to the durability of medical-grade silicone, you can sanitize your Sud Stud in minutes. </span></p>

<p>Leaving Sud Stud in boiling water for a few minutes is enough to kill any surface-level bacteria that can accumulate over time and know that the bacteria isn't stuck inside your Sud Stud. </p>
<p><strong><i><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">*<strong>Dishwasher Safe </strong></span></i></strong><i><span style=""font-size: 12px;"">— Our silicone is BPA-Free and can withstand high-temperature washes and boiling water. Leave in one dishwasher cycle for complete sanitation.</span></i></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><font color=""#0098d4""><span style=""font-size: 26px;""><b>Durable and Tear-Resistant</b></span></font></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;color:#333333;"">Thanks to the strength of stretchy medical-grade silicone, Sud Stud V2 will last significantly longer than leading bathroom products. </span></p>

We've since expanded into offering high-quality soaps made with natural ingredients through an artisanal cold-press process here in the United States and more. </p><p>I'm coming back to crowdfund the Sud Stud V2, the ultimate cleaning experience. </p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong><strong><span style=""font-size:26px;""><span style=""color:#0098D4;"">Why We Made a V2</span></span></strong></strong></p><p>After listening to customers on their experience with Sud Stud, we knew we needed to make some adjustments. The V1, a smaller sleeve, is best for popular soaps like Irish Spring and Zest, but not optimally sized for larger brands and sizes.

Sud Stud V2 has been tested with:

Sud Stud Soaps — 3.2 oz natural cold-pressed soaps


Dr. Squatch — 5 oz natural soaps


Oars + Alps— 6 oz natural moisturizing bar soaps


Dove Beauty Bar — 4 oz dermatologist-endorsed bar


LUSH Outback Mate — *Size may vary, for testing, we used a 5 oz cut of this premium natural soap


Harry's Bar Soap — 5 oz soaps made by scientists.


Duke Cannon — You can cut the 9oz soap in half extending the life of your soap even further!


Old Spice — 4oz soap bars in your favorite scents


Irish Spring — 3.7 - 6oz bar soaps available

  Reduced Surface Area for SoapsTo finish one bar of soap with Sud Stud, a regular soap bar user would have used 4-5 bars of soap.Sud Stud V2's honeycomb pattern reduces the surface area of soap by up to 80%. so that water isn't hitting parts of the soap and washing away unused soap molecules, making your soap last up to 5 times longer.  Long-Term Environmental Benefits.Made with durable silicone, Sud Stud is built to last 50 times longer than plastic poofs and loofahs.Natural soap bars can have a smaller impact on the environment over time, especially if the brand practices environmentally sustainable sourcing and material usage. Body washes tend to come in plastic bottles, which depending on who's using it, may or may not make it to the recycling plant. *Did You Know? — Pumps sometimes included with plastic body wash bottles are not directly recyclable. They are made from mixed materials that are difficult for most facilities to separate!

Prevent
Bacteria Growth

 
Sud Stud is made with anti-bacterial medical-grade silicone that's BPA free, safe for dishwashers, and designed to help your soap dry quickly in between uses.
 
Medical-Grade Antibacterial Silicone
Unlike traditional loofahs and poofs, Sud Stud is antibacterial and eliminates bacteria build-up often caused in humid environments.

By design, silicone is naturally anti-bacterial. As a completely ""sealed"" surface, water cannot enter silicone where bacteria and mold can grow over time. This helps keep Sud Stud germ free over time. 
 
Optimized Drain for Quick Drying
When not in use, Sud Stud V2 can be easily hung, draining excess water to help your soap last when not in use.

When not in use, hang Sud Stud with it’s re-engineered tie-hole. This ensures your Sud Stud hangs to dry with drain holes on the bottom of your Sud Stud, which are small enough to keep slivers of soap inside.
 
Easy to Clean and Sanitize
Thanks to the durability of medical-grade silicone, you can sanitize your Sud Stud in minutes. 

Leaving Sud Stud in boiling water for a few minutes is enough to kill any surface-level bacteria that can accumulate over time and know that the bacteria isn't stuck inside your Sud Stud. 
*Dishwasher Safe — Our silicone is BPA-Free and can withstand high-temperature washes and boiling water. Leave in one dishwasher cycle for complete sanitation.
 
Durable and Tear-Resistant
Thanks to the strength of stretchy medical-grade silicone, Sud Stud V2 will last significantly longer than leading bathroom products. 

With a long lifespan, Sud Stud stands up to daily use and performs the same wash after wash.

*Measurements redacted to protect IP.


Size — Optimally sized to fit the most common soap bar sizes up to 6oz with the ability to adapt without much effect on the overall efficiency of Sud Stud V2's features. 


Shape — Hexagonal shape is the optimal design for compatibility with the most popular rectangle and square-shaped soap bars while also being compatible with round, or other irregular shaped soap bars.


Pillars — Internally, there are 6 pillars that provide support for the edges and holds the soap in place while also allowing SudStud to maintain form as the bather grips or squeezes while scrubbing.


Bristles — To maximize the cleaning power behind Sud Stud V2, over 900 bristles provide gentle exfoliation while still effectively removing dirt, grime and bacteria.


Combs — Patented Honeycomb design reduces friction between soap and skin by 80% that allows one single bar of soap to last 5x longer.


Tie-Hole — Optimally placed to hang your Sud Stud to dry, the larger tie-hole makes it easy to install the included strap while allowing the drain holes to remove excess water.


Materials —  Antimicrobial medical-grade silicone out-performs other materials and remains flexible, durable, fast to dry, easy to clean for our users.


Slimmer Entry Point— Allows for soaps near the end of their extended life to stay inside Sud Stud while washing while also providing traction to hold onto large bars of soap.


 

Easy for Anyone to Use
   Meet Dale of Sud Stud Hi, I'm Dale Lin, Inventor of Sud Stud and the Sud Stud V2.I'm an inventor and entrepreneur with a proven track record in creating fun and unique products. My first campaign, ""Revoq"" delivered to over 1,700 backers in 2017. As a soap connoisseur, I created Sud Stud as a way to not only help great smelling soaps last longer but to create a better cleaning experience. In 2019, we launched Sud Stud, which has delivered to over 10,000 customers worldwide! We've since expanded into offering high-quality soaps made with natural ingredients through an artisanal cold-press process here in the United States and more. I'm coming back to crowdfund the Sud Stud V2, the ultimate cleaning experience.  Why We Made a V2After listening to customers on their experience with Sud Stud, we knew we needed to make some adjustments. The V1, a smaller sleeve, is best for popular soaps like Irish Spring and Zest, but not optimally sized for larger brands and sizes. With the Sud Stud V2, we improve on the sizing as well as introduce a new bristle side for all-around cleaning efficiency. We can't wait to see what you think! Sud Stud V2 Roadmap   Share the Suds!!!Buy 2, Get 3 for $22 With FREE Shipping to the US",37.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p></p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 24px;line-height: 30px;"">Easy 3 Steps Installation</span></h4>
<p>Installation of FlipFlic takes seconds. In one click, the small device attaches to your window blinds magnetically. No tools needed!</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">FlipFlic for Horizontal Blinds fits horizontal Venetian blinds, where the twist / rod / tilting wand can be detached. Please check your blinds beforehand. FlipFlic works with 1''/25mm/ mini blinds up to 78'' (200 cm) wide and 2''/50 mm/ blinds up to 60'' (152 cm) wide.</span><br/></p>
<p><b>NOTE: Are your horizontal blinds tilted by pulling cords/strings? We are launching a different design for them soon, get into waitlist here: </b><a href=""http://eepurl.com/bVIgo1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://eepurl.com/bVIgo1</a><b>.</b></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>FlipFlic for Vertical Blinds has the same features. It works with vertical blinds with either wand- or chain- control of the slats position. It is super easy to install. Snap FlipFlic from either side of the headrail right on the rotating shaft. It also detaches easily. Make sure you have 2 inches to the wall from either side of the headrail to fit the device.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Automatic Control</span><br/></p>Wouldn't it be great if your blinds could adjust by themselves? No need to take out your phone. We fitted FlipFlic with a timer, light and temperature sensors. We developed default software algorithms to keep the amount of sunlight and heat at your comfort level. FlipFlic makes sure it is never too hot or too cold.</div>

<h3>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING</h3>
<p>The FlipFlic's design is set. We are now moving into integrations and pre-production. This means we expect to see only minor changes before product release. Our next phase will be focused on testing for design validation, PCB, and design updates after tests, completing the required certifications, packaging design, and spinning up our production lines. </p>

<p><b>The First Prototype</b></p>
<p>The first proof-of-concept prototype was Wi-Fi connected and worked on 6 AA batteries. It was called Jalousier. It got lots of attention in 2014. It also secured our selection to Buildit Hardware Accelerator where we became the company and started working on the project full-time. The FlipFlic team moved to Estonia, where in 9 months, we built a sellable and scalable prototype, took first pre-orders, and raised a small angel round</p>

FlipFlic: KEY FEATURES

PRODUCT DETAILS

FlipFlic fills the gap offering a smart, easy-to-install, affordable solution for window coverings. Set it and forget it!

Easy 3 Steps Installation
Installation of FlipFlic takes seconds. In one click, the small device attaches to your window blinds magnetically. No tools needed!

Horizontal and Vertical Blinds







FlipFlic for Horizontal Blinds fits horizontal Venetian blinds, where the twist / rod / tilting wand can be detached. Please check your blinds beforehand. FlipFlic works with 1''/25mm/ mini blinds up to 78'' (200 cm) wide and 2''/50 mm/ blinds up to 60'' (152 cm) wide.
NOTE: Are your horizontal blinds tilted by pulling cords/strings? We are launching a different design for them soon, get into waitlist here: http://eepurl.com/bVIgo1.


FlipFlic for Vertical Blinds has the same features. It works with vertical blinds with either wand- or chain- control of the slats position. It is super easy to install. Snap FlipFlic from either side of the headrail right on the rotating shaft. It also detaches easily. Make sure you have 2 inches to the wall from either side of the headrail to fit the device.
Automatic ControlWouldn't it be great if your blinds could adjust by themselves? No need to take out your phone. We fitted FlipFlic with a timer, light and temperature sensors. We developed default software algorithms to keep the amount of sunlight and heat at your comfort level. FlipFlic makes sure it is never too hot or too cold.



Solar-Powered

FlipFlic is absolutely autonomous. It has a built-in battery, recharged via micro USB with a solar panel. There is no need for power outlets or battery replacements.
A solar panel, installed indoors, harnesses the sunlight. Simply stick it to the window glass. If you choose not to use the solar panel or are in a dark or shaded window, FlipFlic is easily removed for periodic charging via standard MicroUSB cable (included). Without the solar panel, we estimate that recharging may be required approximately once every 30 days of average use. 
*The final form-factor (squared or long and thin) shall be defined in Backer Survey.FlipFlic App
With FlipFlic, app users can program all settings individually. You can instantly open/close the blinds, or simply let FlipFlic use its light and temperature sensors and adjust automatically.
FlipFlic app is available on App Store. Android version coming soon!   App in Action





Smart Home Integration






FlipFlic can be integrated into your pre-existing smart home systems via BLE and ZigBee:


and counting... FlipFlic will accommodate new smart home integrations by one step firmware updates installed using the mobile app.
We are members of Icontrol Labs, which ensures the ZigBee firmware in FlipFlic will be Icontrol-certified and available to users of supported smart home solutions powered by Icontrol Networks. This means Flipflic will be compatible with other Icontrol-supported products (like ADT Pulse, Xfinity Home, PEQ, Piper) and eligible for distribution through their service provider channels.



Beautiful and Functional Design
Window blinds are part of your home interior. It took us three major design alterations to get to the beautiful and functional design you will simply love.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING
The FlipFlic's design is set. We are now moving into integrations and pre-production. This means we expect to see only minor changes before product release. Our next phase will be focused on testing for design validation, PCB, and design updates after tests, completing the required certifications, packaging design, and spinning up our production lines. 





 PROJECT HISTORY
The First Prototype
The first proof-of-concept prototype was Wi-Fi connected and worked on 6 AA batteries. It was called Jalousier. It got lots of attention in 2014. It also secured our selection to Buildit Hardware Accelerator where we became the company and started working on the project full-time. The FlipFlic team moved to Estonia, where in 9 months, we built a sellable and scalable prototype, took first pre-orders, and raised a small angel round


The Second Prototype
Comfee, our next prototype already had a custom PCB. A two-module system allowed for installation on the right and left sides of blinds. It was a fully functioning BLE beta. We soft-molded it in silicon and made 100 beta-units. Getting to this stage allowed us to secure angel funding and get selected to Highway1 Accelerator in San Francisco, USA. We also learned a lot about delivering a hardware product and all the hidden costs.

We shipped over 100 units of our beta design.




The Final Prototype and Vertical Version
It has taken a while! The team relocated the company and business to the US in August 2015. During the three-month program, leading hardware experts and founders of other smart home companies advised us.


A trip to China, Shenzhen to establish the connection to Chinese manufacturers brought FlipFlic to the next level. Now the team is ready to ramp up mass production.
We are proud to present to the Kickstarter community our final generation of FlipFlic Horizontal and its new version: FlipFlic Vertical. But, there is more to come!

It's woven with pure silver and organic cotton, providing revolutionary protection, and unmatched softness and absorbency.   The Problem:Constantly used and rarely washed, kitchen towels are a breeding ground for bacteria and primary source of cross contamination. (Cross contamination is when bacteria is unintentionally transferred from one surface to another )There are an estimated 582 million cases of food-borne diseases, and 351,000 associated deaths worldwide. And 28% were a result of cross contamination.Our SolutionOur Micro-fine fibers are carefully coated with pure silver, and proven to prevent the growth of bacteria like Salmonella and E.coli on the towel. By twisting these silver fibers with organic cotton, the Silvon Towel stops this bacterial growth while remaining lusciously soft and absorbent.All natural, no chemicalsWe use advanced yarn made with pure silver right here in the USA. Similar products rely on cheaper, synthetic alternatives that wash out over time.Backed by real scienceWe’ve partnered with one of the world’s leading microbiology labs to test our towels. Where they expose our towels to E.coli and Salmonella and after 4 hours found E.coli was reduced by 96.8% and Salmonella by 92.5%.Lab ReportCertifications: The international standard (ISO) 20743, is the test method used on Silvon products. This method is designed to test the ability of fabrics to prevent microbial growth. Simply put, fabric samples are exposed to bacteria, and the antimicrobial activity is closely monitored and measured.How it worksSilvon relies on the oligodynamic effects of natural silver, a well regarded antibacterial property that destroys bacteria cells. This technology has been verified by more than a decade of testing at research institutions including Pennsylvania State University and Cornell University.  The result is a 99% reduction in bacteria on the fabric surface, drastically reducing the risk of cross contamination.Rewards:Why us:Over the past year we’ve launched the world famous bed sheets and bath towels. We’ve raised over $2 million from 16,000+ backers. This is just the beginning of our journey to revolutionize the fabrics that are part of our everyday lives.We pored over research, studies and customer feedback to see what other products could benefit from our advanced silver yarn. From there, we set out to take this research and design another product that could help everyone. After months of prototypes and lab tests, we've created a kitchen towel that we know you'll love.Production Timeline

   The Ask

I am asking for $5000 in order to take a proof of concept prototype and develop five alpha version rice cookers that I can get into people's hands. The money will go towards:



Product development and design expenses, including engineering consulting time
Product testing to ensure reliability

With the progress that has been made so far, it is my firm belief that this product deserves to see the light of day. Your help will make this possible and enable the product to reach market readiness. 

Your support is critical to designing a product that has the following features:

Simplicity of use: design for a user experience that enables simplest possible use, namely ""insert ingredients and press a button""
Ease of maintenance: making the product easy to clean
Reliability: assessing points of failure and ensuring product lifetime

As an engineer with experience in robotics, I have full faith that these challenges can be solved with a little tinkering. Thank you!

   The Impact Al-Dente has the potential to improve health outcomes globally. Rice is one of the most consumed foods in the world, with over 50 countries that consume at least 47 grams of rice per capita per day. 
Imagine if every cup of rice consumed had a lower glycemic index, lower carbohydrate content, and fewer calories, how much healthier the world would be!
The Future Vision
Al-Dente has the potential to automate the cooking of any food that is cooked by boiling and draining water, including:


Potatoes
Vegetables
Noodles
Quinoa
Couscous
Pasta
Beans
Lentils

Friends of the Briarwood Pool partnered with the YMCA in 2014 to help keep a valuable community resource open and serving members of the community. Our initial fundraising effort was highly successful and provided the funds needed to make updates and repairs, both large and small, to the facility and enable the YMCA to open the pool for the 2014 season. It brought together a diverse group of people who wanted to ensure that individuals and families would have a cool place to go during the hot summer. The Briarwood Dolphins Swim Team registration was 93 this year, up from 63 in 2013. Additional repairs and upgrades, such as a new roof on the poolhouse, are still in the works, and we need to maintain capital reserves that are sufficient to respond to unforeseen events. Let's make 2015 another great year at the Briarwood Pool!!!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What Is Bamboo Charcoal?</b></h3>
<p>Bamboo charcoal is produced from burning organic bamboo at 800°C then grinding and filtering it into nano-sized powder. Organic bamboo charcoal is 100% safe to use in fabric and directly on our skin. In fact, bamboo charcoal has already been widely used with great success in beauty products, water filters, even foods and medicines! It eliminates odours, absorbs excess moisture and purifies water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>What Is Bamboo Lyocell?</b></h3>
<p>Bamboo lyocell is a fabric that consists of fibre made from dissolving organic bamboo pulp. We are the FIRST company in the world to make 100% bamboo lyocell bedding. This fabric is superior to any other bamboo products on the market right now which uses the old fashioned viscose/rayon process. </p>
<p>Lyocell fabrication process is the most sustainable fabrication process, using a closed-loop system. 99% of the organic solvent and water in the process is recycled and reused up to 200 times. This process has minimal environmental impact,  with economical use of both energy and water. Bamboo lyocell fabric is incredibly soft, silky and super breathable. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><b>Bamboo Charcoal + Lyocell</b></h3>
<p>Bamboo charcoal powder is added in the bamboo lyocell fabrication process to create the world's healthiest bedding fabric.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>Why Organic Bamboo Charcoal Powder Works?</b></h3>
<p>Bamboo charcoal powder's ultra-fine structure contains millions of tiny gaps, which allows <b>1 gram of bamboo charcoal powder to cover a surface area of 600 square meters</b>. This super porous structure of bamboo charcoal powder absorbs bacteria, unwanted odour and wicks away sweat up to 50% quicker than cotton. </p>
<p>According to research, bamboo charcoal can absorb formaldehyde at a rate of 16% ~ 19.39%; as for benzene, the rate is 8.69% ~ 10.08%; as for toluene, the rate is 5.65% ~ 8.42%; ammonia with the rate of 22.73% ~ 30.65%; chloroform with the high rate of 40.68%. Bamboo Charcoal fiber also effectively decomposes the micro-organisms attached to its surface and in the air around it. According to ASTME2149 (The American Association for Testing and Materials) test method and standards, bamboo charcoal fiber has an antimicrobial rate of 84%.</p>

<h1><b style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">The Most Sustainable Bedding Fabric To Date</b></h1>
<p>Organic bamboo charcoal lyocell is a cruelty-free, vegan-friendly, 100% plant derived fabric that has all the softness and smoothness of silk or high count Egyptian cotton. It is also more sustainable and eco-friendly than any other new types of functional textiles such as silver ion fabric. </p>
<p>Bamboo fabric is 100% biodegradable, whereas silver is either infused or woven directly into the fabric, it ends up in the landfill and then enters the water system at the end of the product cycle. Silver nanoparticles are antimicrobial because they release silver ‘ions’ – charged molecules of silver – which interfere with processes in living cells. As a result, they have the potential to damage ecologically important bacteria and other microorganisms in soils and aquatic environments, or to accumulate through food chains, which could damage the health of larger creatures including humans.</p>

<h3><b>Care Instructions</b></h3>
<p>Bamboo charcoal lyocell bedding is super easy to care for. Just machine wash cold separately and line dry or tumble dry low and you are all set to enjoy them and the long lasting freshness for years to come! We do not recommend using bleaches, as they are usually packed with toxic chemicals. Fabric softener is also not necessary with bamboo sheets – they are already super soft and will stay that way wash after wash.</p>
<h1> </h1>
<div><h3>Perks</h3></div>
<p>We offer pillow case, flat/top sheet and duvet cover separately so you can mix and match your bedding essentials.</p>
<p>The Sheet Set (with one fitted sheet and two pillow cases) is the starter kit to complete your bed. You can also add extra flat/top sheet and duvet cover for extra layers of comfort.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Timely fulfilment of rewards is extremely important to us.</p>
<p>The good news is that Ettitude Bamboo Charcoal Lyocell Collection is the result of a collaboration between us, our long-term manufacturer and fabric suppliers. They've participated at every stage of the development process and have produced many prototypes leading to the final ones you see in our video and on this page.</p>
<p>We have done our best to make realistic projections of the amount of raw materials and the time needed to manufacture the sheets. Based on our past experience, we anticipate being able to fulfill orders within 10–12 weeks. But we should note that forecasting demand is an inexact science. If order volumes exceed our expectations, it might take slightly longer to fulfill orders.</p>We partnered with the right people, completed all sampling, and sourced the best fabrics, so we're confident to ship the “perfect” sheets that will exceed all your expectations. We believe in transparency and communication, so our backers will be the first to know about any unplanned hurdles or delays, although, at this point in the project, they are highly unlikely.</div><div> <p> </p>

Bamboo charcoal powder's ultra-fine structure contains millions of tiny gaps, which allows 1 gram of bamboo charcoal powder to cover a surface area of 600 square meters. This super porous structure of bamboo charcoal powder absorbs bacteria, unwanted odour and wicks away sweat up to 50% quicker than cotton. 
According to research, bamboo charcoal can absorb formaldehyde at a rate of 16% ~ 19.39%; as for benzene, the rate is 8.69% ~ 10.08%; as for toluene, the rate is 5.65% ~ 8.42%; ammonia with the rate of 22.73% ~ 30.65%; chloroform with the high rate of 40.68%. Bamboo Charcoal fiber also effectively decomposes the micro-organisms attached to its surface and in the air around it. According to ASTME2149 (The American Association for Testing and Materials) test method and standards, bamboo charcoal fiber has an antimicrobial rate of 84%.
 

We are giving your bedsheets additional anti-microbial properties by fusing bamboo lyocell fabric with bamboo charcoal. 

 
The Most Sustainable Bedding Fabric To Date
Organic bamboo charcoal lyocell is a cruelty-free, vegan-friendly, 100% plant derived fabric that has all the softness and smoothness of silk or high count Egyptian cotton. It is also more sustainable and eco-friendly than any other new types of functional textiles such as silver ion fabric. 
Bamboo fabric is 100% biodegradable, whereas silver is either infused or woven directly into the fabric, it ends up in the landfill and then enters the water system at the end of the product cycle. Silver nanoparticles are antimicrobial because they release silver ‘ions’ – charged molecules of silver – which interfere with processes in living cells. As a result, they have the potential to damage ecologically important bacteria and other microorganisms in soils and aquatic environments, or to accumulate through food chains, which could damage the health of larger creatures including humans.

All our products are made with FSC-certified organic bamboo and pass the Oeko-Tex Standard 100 test to make sure no harmful substances remained in the products at the end of the manufacturing process. 
We also work closely with our manufacturing partners to make sure all our products are ethically made. Our factory is certified by Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP), which is awarded based upon both internationally and nationally accepted humane workplace standards, safety, and ethical manufacturing regulations.

Care Instructions
Bamboo charcoal lyocell bedding is super easy to care for. Just machine wash cold separately and line dry or tumble dry low and you are all set to enjoy them and the long lasting freshness for years to come! We do not recommend using bleaches, as they are usually packed with toxic chemicals. Fabric softener is also not necessary with bamboo sheets – they are already super soft and will stay that way wash after wash.
 
Perks
We offer pillow case, flat/top sheet and duvet cover separately so you can mix and match your bedding essentials.
The Sheet Set (with one fitted sheet and two pillow cases) is the starter kit to complete your bed. You can also add extra flat/top sheet and duvet cover for extra layers of comfort.

Why Ettitude?
 
 
Ettitude is a sustainable bedding brand offering high quality, modern, minimalistic bedding at accessible prices with a focus on innovative fabric technology. Ettitude is created on the belief that bedding should be healthy, good quality and affordable as we spend 1/3 of our lives in bed. A healthy and comfortable sleep environment is so critical to sleep quality and life quality. We constantly research and develop new sustainable bedding materials that can provide additional health benefits because it's our mission to help everyone have the best night's sleep possible.
We care about doing good from start to finish. So that's why we spend more than a year to create, test and perfect these bamboo charcoal lyocell sheets that start from organic plants, using a highly eco-friendly fabrication process and will completely biodegrade after they provide you with years of comfortable and healthy sleep!

Risks and challenges
Timely fulfilment of rewards is extremely important to us.
The good news is that Ettitude Bamboo Charcoal Lyocell Collection is the result of a collaboration between us, our long-term manufacturer and fabric suppliers. They've participated at every stage of the development process and have produced many prototypes leading to the final ones you see in our video and on this page.
We have done our best to make realistic projections of the amount of raw materials and the time needed to manufacture the sheets. Based on our past experience, we anticipate being able to fulfill orders within 10–12 weeks. But we should note that forecasting demand is an inexact science. If order volumes exceed our expectations, it might take slightly longer to fulfill orders.We partnered with the right people, completed all sampling, and sourced the best fabrics, so we're confident to ship the “perfect” sheets that will exceed all your expectations. We believe in transparency and communication, so our backers will be the first to know about any unplanned hurdles or delays, although, at this point in the project, they are highly unlikely.

<h3>Blending Organic Forms With Technology Using Wood</h3>
<p>Jenny Wong-Stanley has been blending art and science with <a href=""http://artofplants.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Art of Plants</a> in her Oakland art studio for several years, and after nearly a year prototyping her lighting for <a href=""http://ellipticdesigns.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elliptic Designs</a>, she is ready for production (Follow our progress on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/ellipticdesigns/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> @ellipticdesigns!).</p>

<p>We think very highly of our medium of choice – wood. Each wood species has a ""personality"" that we respect and cherish. Our inspiration for these lights are the fascinating patterns that analytic geometry produces when modeled and fabricated precisely.  For example, Styles 1-3 of the 'Wave' series design all stem from the same <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damped_sine_wave"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">damped sine wave</a> with exponential decay:  1/2 ^(x/h) * a* sin(2* π *( x/w) ).  We realize that it's a bit nerdy but we love this stuff.</p>

<p>If you have seen current key and device finders, you have probably felt our frustration: The key finders are bulky and impossible to use on small gadgets like iPod clips, reading glasses, remote controls, etc. Even worse, they have a very low range and lack the ability to track devices effectively.</p>
<p>That's why we designed The Gadget Hound - Simple to use, aesthetically-pleasing and with no large FOB-like devices.  Its range surpasses anything like it on the market, the receivers are small and built to last years attached to your various devices and the transmitter can be plugged in or used with the rechargeable battery and mounted to a refrigerator by magnets.</p>
<p>Usage is a breeze. Just depress the transmitter button, corresponding to the device you wish to find.  Listen for the loud beeps and find your device.</p>
<p> <strong>Our Team</strong></p>
<p> We have the most experienced team members in their areas of expertise. </p>
<p>Carla Miaule, Managing Member: Carla is the creator and founder of The Gadget Hound and serves as the Managing Member of the Company.  She worked 10 years as Managing Director and VP of Diligence to privately-held organizations.  She also taught intellectual property for several colleges.  Carla received her Executive MBA from Pepperdine University’s Grazadio School of Business.</p>
<p>Edgar Ellsworth, Chief Designer and Electrical Engineer:  Ed is an engineer, business development and general management professional with experience in bringing new technologies and products to market. Highly versatile with a collaborative cross functional focus, he has proven capabilities for investing, developing, commercializing, and advancing technology with large, small and start-up companies. Ed holds a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology, Electronics with a Minor in Computer Science and a Master of Science in Business Administration with emphasis on new venture creation, all from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.</p>
<p>John Anderson, Project Manager: John is CEO of Belcon Industries and leads a multi-disciplined advanced technology management group that oversees startups and provides consulting services to existing companies to remove barriers to technology implementation.  Their resources include technical expertise in science, applications development, systems engineering, software engineering and manufacturing.

In this role he focused on substantially integrating and expanding Beckman Coulter’s technology portfolio value and accelerating corporate growth. He holds a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Genetics from the University of Arizona.</p>
<p>John Silzel Ph.D, Systems Engineers and Acoustics design:  John serves at Biola University as Professor of Chemistry. In addition, he teaches electronic circuits &amp; instrumentation and does research on musical instrument physics. John has 18 years industry experience developing new technologies for biomedical research and diagnostics and he is a proven systems engineering technical expert and innovator of complex products spanning hardware, software, chemistry, optics, and algorithms for use in the analytical sciences and musical arts. John received his Ph.D. and Bachelor of Science from University of California, Irvine.</p>

Prior to that, he worked with Toyota Racing on design and development of NASCAR engines.  Kyle has a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from California Institute of Technology and Master of Science in Astronautical Engineering from the University of Southern California.</p>
<p><strong>Usage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Large home? Doesn't matter. </strong>The Gadget Hound works like nothing like it on the market.  We have paid careful attention to the ability to use The Gadget Hound in a large 3,000 sf home, taking into consideration walls, seat cushions, etc.  The transmitter has a small exposed sleek antenna that relates to the various tiny receivers on your devices.  The ability to find a device easily is so simple.</p>
<p><strong>I Live in a Small Apartment.  Do I Really Need The Gadget Hound? </strong>What many people don't realize is that each wall in your home accounts for approximately 100 sf (due to the wall constructs) that must be transmitted through (think about how many walls and rooms you have in your home).  Additionally, stairs, cushions and any other possible obstacle can prevent the transmitter from properly connecting with a receiver, so it's important to have a powerful, effective device that can be relied upon when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Small devices?  It doesn’t matter.  </strong>The Gadget Hound is designed to be used with some of the smallest devices, including the ability to adhere to the smallest iPod™, phone, wallets, glasses, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Design Features and Benefits</strong></p>
<p><strong>Obsessive attention to Quality.</strong><strong>  </strong>We paid close attention to quality. The Gadget Hound was designed to resolve many outstanding issues with similar products by making it the last retrieval device that you will need.  The design resolves the current issues with range, size/bulkiness and aesthetics as well as usage issues on a wide array of everyday gadgets. </p>
<p>The Gadget Hound is made with a soft, rubberized material that complements any gadget.  The transmitter also looks sleek and elegant, mounted on your refrigerator or in a wall socket.  The receivers are soft to the touch, but are strong, durable and look gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>More Useful Features and Benefits.</strong></p>
<p>* Bright flashing light on the transmitter warns of a low battery, which will then prompt you to recharge the device with the included flip-up, plug-in component</p>
<p>* Loud distinctive sound that can be heard for hundreds of feet</p>
<p>* Micropower technology provides long battery life</p>
<p>* Compact, extremely durable, and lightweight, so you’ll forget it’s attached to your device – until you need it</p>
<p>* Responds over distances up to 3,000 square feet. </p>
<p>* Easy to use and activate.  Just depress the button corresponding to the object you are trying to find.  Wait a few seconds and the receiver will activate and signal where the object is located – even under cushions, behind walls, doors, etc. </p>
<p>* Prevents time wasting and frustration – Imagine being able to find anything within seconds!!</p>
<p>* Durable enough to use every day -- Its rubberized, sturdy outer-coating protects and is sleek and durable – think of the cool rubber coatings used for Apple iPhones.</p>
<p>* Incredibly easy to use making it great for everyone of all ages – The Gadget Hound’s simplicity is perfect for the young and elderly alike. </p>
<p>* Most discrete, reliable and sensitive gadget finding device <strong>ever</strong> developed of its kind</p>
<p>* Makes an ideal gift that will be greatly appreciated ... again and again.  * The Gadget Hound is patent pending and is unique in its design to all other competitive products. </p>
<p><strong>Will this really work?  I’m a Skeptic.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re like us, you’ve probably used similar products that promised you’ll never lose your (insert gadget here) again.  And, when you needed it, you were sorely disappointed.  We’ve done a lot of research when we created The Gadget Hound.  In fact, <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/wymeditor_iframe/Amazon.com%E2%84%A2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazon.com™</a> was our favorite “go-to” because it gave us great feedback from everyday consumers about their likes and dislikes on product capabilities.  We focused on these comments and created a product that would surpass expectations and addressed shortcomings and inaccurate claims from competitive products.  We really want to make sure that we “wow-ed” you.</p>
<p><strong>Why Are You Raising Funds?</strong></p>
<p>We are raising money to contribute to sizeable first manufacturing run, which brings the retail cost down significantly.  This in turn allows us to thank our Indiegogo contributors with gifts while also allowing us to build our inventory for sales.</p>

Have you ever slept for over 8 hours, but still felt quite exhausted after waking up? Studies find that, of all sleep stages, the Deep Sleep Stage provides the most restorative sleep. As long as you can get 2 hours of deep sleep at night, a refreshing morning can be yours.

 
A key factor of good-quality sleep is your PILLOW. The importance is no less than choosing the partner that sleeps beside you. 
 
The World’s First Pillow with Cutting Edge Structure Design that Enables You to Drift Off to Sleep Comfortably and Quickly. 

According to our joint research with the Nightform Lab, four crucial elements were identified and incorporated into the design of The Cubes to meet the needs for a good night’s sleep.
 

 

Did you know that you can roll over more than 20 times during sleep each night? Before, there was no pillow that could satisfy so many different sleeping positions, until The Cubes: A pillow that can adjust its structure to conform to your positions and support your weight no matter how you roll at night.

 

The patented hinged structure on both sides of the surface elevates the level of support from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. Each cube functions as a spring structure that can individually support weight when pressure is applied and subsequently bounce back to its original shape when depressed.

 
No matter which position you prefer the most, The Cubes will adjust itself to fit you and will relieve you of your muscular tension and stiffness. Fall asleep easier with the The Cubes and wake up feeling more refreshed than before!


 

Snoring often occurs when sleeping flat, with the neck inadequately supported, creating the airway to narrow or close completely.
The Cubes is designed to provide support with its hinged structure, to respond to your breathing movements when sleeping flat thus keeping your airway open and your breathing smooth and quiet.

 


With the unique design of different thickness and cutting depth to the two sides of the foam, The Cubes offers both a firm and a soft double-sided pillow for all needs.A stomach sleeper or one who enjoys a fairly flat pillow, the Soft side is for you.If you prefer a fluffy or thicker pillow, then the Firm side is for you.

 
 
Memory foam was invented to protect the astronauts from the extreme pressure experiences during launch and landing. The Cubes utilizes memory foam to automatically conform to your sleeping position and gently support your head.A zero gravity sleeping experience, total relaxation for your sleep.


 
 
There are five stages in sleep and stage 3 and 4 are considered deep sleep stages. Deep sleep provides the most restorative sleep of sleep stages. During this stage, human growth hormones are released to restore body muscles and nerves, and at the same time the immune system repairs itself. 
Based on our experiments, The Cubes can effectively extend the duration of your deep sleep stage.

Its combination of sensors and electronics enable it to not only detect high levels of smoke, natural gas, and lack of motion (or, you in the kitchen), but also react and turn your stove off to keep you safe. It also allows you to monitor your stove remotely and modulate the burner temperature. With Inirv React, you never have to worry about leaving your stove on again!  All of our homes have smoke detectors that detect high levels of smoke and warn us if there is a hazard. However, they don’t intervene and prevent the situation from getting worse. We knew a better solution was needed so we designed a revolutionary product that not only prevents hazardous situations but reacts to prevent them from escalating.                     Inirv React provides you with peace of mind knowing that your home, family and belongings are safe, no matter what you’re whipping up in your kitchen.There is a lot of technology that goes into our small, but mighty, device. Learn how Inirv React keeps your home safe!   The sensor unit houses the gas, smoke and motion detectors that monitor your kitchen’s environment. If it senses high levels of smoke or gas, or if the motion sensor recognizes that the stove was left on accidentally, this unit signals the knob units via Bluetooth technology to turn off your burners.  The knob units turn your burners off when a hazard is detected by the sensor unit. Attach these units to your stove and use them as your new knobs, or simply attach your existing knobs back onto these units with the supplied adapter.     The smartphone app allows you to easily monitor your kitchen environment and status of your stove. You will also receive real-time alerts if a hazard is detected or if you left the house with your stove on. But you don’t just get alerts! You can turn your stove off or change the temperature right from your phone!      Once in place, Inirv React not only recognizes dangerous situations, but also reacts to them by turning your burners off to keep you and your home safe. The LED rings on the knob units glow bright red when high levels of smoke or gas have been detected. The knob units then activate to turn your burner(s) off.  The LED rings on the knob units glow bright orange one minute before the timer expires due to lack of activity in the kitchen. If no motion is detected in that one minute, the knob unit activates and turns your burner off.Inirv React is equipped with a motion sensor and timer that identify and react to periods of prolonged absence. A default timer setting of 15 minutes is automatically set when you turn your stove on. So, what does this mean? After 15 minutes of no activity in your kitchen with the stove left on, the timer will expire and the knob unit will activate to turn your burner off. To prevent the timer from expiring and your stove from turning off, just check on it every 15 minutes. Each time you enter your kitchen and the sensor unit detects motion, the timer is reset. Need to adjust the timer? Simply tap the touch sensor to cycle through the settings. There are 4 to choose from for maximum flexibility! You can also set each knob unit to have a different timer setting. Made with safe, high quality materials to ensure durability, Inirv React is sure to help keep you and your family safe from harmful conditions for years to come. It is also heat, chemical, and water resistant, so don’t worry about what you spill on it! With its universal stove adapter, Inirv React works on any gas or electric stove. Even better, it doesn’t require professional installation! You can install it yourself in just a few minutes and know your home is protected.We want Inirv React to look great in your home! Choose from our white, black or stainless steel color options to match the decor of your kitchen when we send out a survey at the end of the campaign.    Use your stove like you normally do! As soon as you turn it on, Inirv React automatically activates and monitors your kitchen for dangerous conditions. The bright blue glow of the LED rings on the sensor and knob units indicate that you and your home are protected.  You rely on your smartphone for everything else, why not use it to check on your kitchen? The smartphone app will allow you to monitor the environment of your kitchen and receive alerts in real-time even if you are miles away from home. Even more, you can turn off your stove and change the temperature of your burners right from your phone - no need to rush home!   Installation is easy and requires just a few minutes.                      Inirv React comes as a kit with 4 knob units and 1 sensor unit. If you have more than 4 burners, add additional knob units to provide complete protection. Each sensor unit can pair with up to 8 knob units.  The best products are those that are born from personal experience and have the potential to improve the lives of others.

With old security cameras, people had to deal with complicated wiring and weekly camera charging. To solve these problems, we formed a team of experienced engineers and professional designers who have been in the industry for 10+ years. Soliom is dedicated to making advanced surveillance devices low maintenance, green powered, and cost-effective.

Something I have been working on for a long time is a home automation system: I want every light switch and appliance in my house to have WiFi in it in order to control and monitor it. It also needs to be ""plug 'n play"".</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>Arduino is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't really come with WiFi by default... I love the idea of a small, cheap and easy to use ""brain"" board, and so my solution is to do what I do best: design and build my own, and then provide it to others when it's done. </p>
<p>The Quark One is an Arduino compatible board with an Atmel XMEGA at it's heart, an efficient switch mode power supply for maximum flexibility and most importantly, an integrated ESP-01 WiFi module for connectivity.</p>
<p>This campaign aims to fund the initial costs of building some prototypes, covering the minimum order quantities of the components and getting a few working Quark One's into the wild. Once Quark One is fully functional, I plan to run another campaign to mass produce them in order to supply them to you!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What's the Deal?</h3> <p>In order to make Quark One a reality, I need to manufacture a few prototypes and polish the software before they are ready for general purpose proliferation. This process doesn't really cost an arm and a leg, but as a student I don't have a lot of cash to spare!</p>
<p>The electronic design is complete - but if you suggest something that you would really like to see on the Quark One before the end of the campaign, I'll do my best to incorporate your ideas. </p>
<p>Besides bringing Quark One into physical reality using the funds raised by this campaign (I'm hoping that as you read this you are considering making a donation!), the firmware and other software needs work... Various projects exist on the Internet to individually get the ESP-01 WiFi, Atmel XMEGA, Arduino IDE's and Web Interfaces up and running, but they all need integration, tweaking and packaging for maximum ""maker"" and of course user friendliness.</p>
<p><b>Hardware Specifications:</b></p>
<p><b>Board Size:</b> 22.9 x 38.7 mm (For comparison, the Arduino Nano is 45 x 18 mm).<br/><b>Power Supply: </b>Anywhere between 5 to 30 V DC or Micro-USB powered.<br/><b>Microcontroller:</b> Atmel <strike>XMEGA 16A4U-AU (16 kB Flash)</strike> XMEGA 128A4U-AU with 128 kB flash and 8 kB RAM! (The Arduino Nano has 16 kB flash but runs at 16 MHz compared to 32 MHz!)<br/><b>Awesome Peripherals:</b> The XMEGA has a suite of advanced peripherals. A 2 MSa/s ADC with 12 bit resolution is one of them!<br/><b>USB:</b> Micro-USB Device (up to 32 endpoints).<br/><b>External I/O: </b>25 (XMEGA A1-A7, B0-B3, C0-C7, D0-D5) (Arduino Nano has 14).<br/><b>Other External Pins:</b> DC In, 3.3V Out, Ground, Reset.<br/><b>WiFi: </b>ESP-01 Module based on ESP8266.<br/><b>LEDs:</b> One power LED and one LED connected to port B1 for testing or other convenient indications.<br/><b>Clean ADC Power Supply:</b> A power supply filter for the XMEGA analog power is present to enable accurate 12 bit analog measurements with Omega One.<br/><b>Snug Fit XMEGA ICSP Port: </b>No pin header will be fitted to the In Circuit Serial Programming port for the XMEGA. This keeps the board cost down, and also because most of the time the bootloader will be used via USB. In the event that you would like to flash custom firmware, I have staggered the holes so that a header will fit and make electrical contact temporarily with no soldering required!</p>

<p><b>Firmware / Software Specifications:</b></p>
<p><b>Bootloader:</b> The Arduino bootloader for XMEGA will be used, allowing simple and convenient programming from the Arduino IDE.<br/><b>Bootloader Pass-Through Mode: </b>The bootloader will be modified to allow pass-through of the serial connection (via the Micro-USB port) to the ESP-01 WiFi module. This will enable easy programming of the ESP8266 firmware with new web pages, for example.<br/><b>Web Interface:</b> I have some cool ideas on how to implement a sexy, interactive web interface using technologies such as Bootstrap and AngularJS without you, the developer, having to know anything about web development! No ESP8266 firware development will be required - just standard Arduino IDE development to get a functional interface for your IoT projects.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Here is a rough breakdown of the components and other things that will be paid for by your funding:</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Fabrication of at least 10, 2 layer PCBs</b> <i>(I decided to put in some extra design effort and avoid using more expensive, 4 layer PCBs.)</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Atmel XMEGA16A4U-AU microcontrollers</b> <i>(These cheaper 16 kB models can easily be swapped for 32 or even 64 kB versions.)</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>ESP-01 WiFi modules</b> <i>(I decided that these are so mass produced and well used that it's not worth going custom for this!)</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Micro USB connectors</b> <i>(Why use Mini USB when we all have heaps of Micro USB cables lying around from our mobile phones?)</i>
</li>
<li><b>3.3 V switch mode buck converter chips</b></li>
<li><b>A handful of inductors, resistors, capacitors and diodes</b></li>
<li>
<b>Assembly</b> <i>(I plan on hand soldering the prototypes to save money - but it's still something that's required!)</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>Bootloader modifications</b> <i>(XMEGA Arduino bootloaders already exist, but I plan to make modifications to also allow flashing the ESP WiFi module via the USB interface.)</i>
</li>
<li>
<b>WiFi module web interface development</b> <i style=""background-color: initial;"">(I would like every Quark One to be accessible via it's IP address just like an internet router to perform actions or monitor it.)</i>
</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><b>In short: no more WiFi breakout boards for your network enabled projects!</b></div> <p>Currently, Arduino and other similar boards are an immensely popular hobbyist (and sometimes commercial) product. This is most likely due to their low barrier to entry and large community. I feel that network connectivity is vital to enabling infinitely more possible projects (such as my home automation system) and existing boards typically don't have this by default.</p>
<p>We all have WiFi in our homes, offices and perhaps even our vehicles! You are probably reading this over a WiFi connection right now... Why not leverage this existing infrastructure for Internet of Things projects, made possible by the Quark One? Standards such as Zigbee and also custom protocols over ISM radio bands require additional hardware to make them visible to the Internet, mobile devices or computers. WiFi just makes sense.</p>
<p>I plan on making the designs and source code open source, but until it's done it's not really fit for public consumption!</p>
<p>When Quark One is working I hope to launch a larger campaign to fund their mass production. If it so happens that this campaign is really popular, I may fast track that dream!</p>

</div></div>","I'm a PhD student studying high bandwidth optical communications and one of my life-long hobbies is electronics. Something I have been working on for a long time is a home automation system: I want every light switch and appliance in my house to have WiFi in it in order to control and monitor it. It also needs to be ""plug 'n play"".

Arduino is a step in the right direction, but it doesn't really come with WiFi by default... I love the idea of a small, cheap and easy to use ""brain"" board, and so my solution is to do what I do best: design and build my own, and then provide it to others when it's done. 
The Quark One is an Arduino compatible board with an Atmel XMEGA at it's heart, an efficient switch mode power supply for maximum flexibility and most importantly, an integrated ESP-01 WiFi module for connectivity.
This campaign aims to fund the initial costs of building some prototypes, covering the minimum order quantities of the components and getting a few working Quark One's into the wild. Once Quark One is fully functional, I plan to run another campaign to mass produce them in order to supply them to you!   What's the Deal? In order to make Quark One a reality, I need to manufacture a few prototypes and polish the software before they are ready for general purpose proliferation. This process doesn't really cost an arm and a leg, but as a student I don't have a lot of cash to spare!
The electronic design is complete - but if you suggest something that you would really like to see on the Quark One before the end of the campaign, I'll do my best to incorporate your ideas. 
Besides bringing Quark One into physical reality using the funds raised by this campaign (I'm hoping that as you read this you are considering making a donation!), the firmware and other software needs work... Various projects exist on the Internet to individually get the ESP-01 WiFi, Atmel XMEGA, Arduino IDE's and Web Interfaces up and running, but they all need integration, tweaking and packaging for maximum ""maker"" and of course user friendliness.
Hardware Specifications:
Board Size: 22.9 x 38.7 mm (For comparison, the Arduino Nano is 45 x 18 mm).Power Supply: Anywhere between 5 to 30 V DC or Micro-USB powered.Microcontroller: Atmel XMEGA 16A4U-AU (16 kB Flash) XMEGA 128A4U-AU with 128 kB flash and 8 kB RAM! (The Arduino Nano has 16 kB flash but runs at 16 MHz compared to 32 MHz!)Awesome Peripherals: The XMEGA has a suite of advanced peripherals. A 2 MSa/s ADC with 12 bit resolution is one of them!USB: Micro-USB Device (up to 32 endpoints).External I/O: 25 (XMEGA A1-A7, B0-B3, C0-C7, D0-D5) (Arduino Nano has 14).Other External Pins: DC In, 3.3V Out, Ground, Reset.WiFi: ESP-01 Module based on ESP8266.LEDs: One power LED and one LED connected to port B1 for testing or other convenient indications.Clean ADC Power Supply: A power supply filter for the XMEGA analog power is present to enable accurate 12 bit analog measurements with Omega One.Snug Fit XMEGA ICSP Port: No pin header will be fitted to the In Circuit Serial Programming port for the XMEGA. This keeps the board cost down, and also because most of the time the bootloader will be used via USB. In the event that you would like to flash custom firmware, I have staggered the holes so that a header will fit and make electrical contact temporarily with no soldering required!

Firmware / Software Specifications:
Bootloader: The Arduino bootloader for XMEGA will be used, allowing simple and convenient programming from the Arduino IDE.Bootloader Pass-Through Mode: The bootloader will be modified to allow pass-through of the serial connection (via the Micro-USB port) to the ESP-01 WiFi module. This will enable easy programming of the ESP8266 firmware with new web pages, for example.Web Interface: I have some cool ideas on how to implement a sexy, interactive web interface using technologies such as Bootstrap and AngularJS without you, the developer, having to know anything about web development! No ESP8266 firware development will be required - just standard Arduino IDE development to get a functional interface for your IoT projects.

Here is a rough breakdown of the components and other things that will be paid for by your funding:



Fabrication of at least 10, 2 layer PCBs (I decided to put in some extra design effort and avoid using more expensive, 4 layer PCBs.)


Atmel XMEGA16A4U-AU microcontrollers (These cheaper 16 kB models can easily be swapped for 32 or even 64 kB versions.)


ESP-01 WiFi modules (I decided that these are so mass produced and well used that it's not worth going custom for this!)


Micro USB connectors (Why use Mini USB when we all have heaps of Micro USB cables lying around from our mobile phones?)

3.3 V switch mode buck converter chips
A handful of inductors, resistors, capacitors and diodes

Assembly (I plan on hand soldering the prototypes to save money - but it's still something that's required!)


Bootloader modifications (XMEGA Arduino bootloaders already exist, but I plan to make modifications to also allow flashing the ESP WiFi module via the USB interface.)


WiFi module web interface development (I would like every Quark One to be accessible via it's IP address just like an internet router to perform actions or monitor it.)


    The Impact
In short: no more WiFi breakout boards for your network enabled projects! Currently, Arduino and other similar boards are an immensely popular hobbyist (and sometimes commercial) product. This is most likely due to their low barrier to entry and large community. I feel that network connectivity is vital to enabling infinitely more possible projects (such as my home automation system) and existing boards typically don't have this by default.
We all have WiFi in our homes, offices and perhaps even our vehicles! You are probably reading this over a WiFi connection right now... Why not leverage this existing infrastructure for Internet of Things projects, made possible by the Quark One? Standards such as Zigbee and also custom protocols over ISM radio bands require additional hardware to make them visible to the Internet, mobile devices or computers. WiFi just makes sense.
I plan on making the designs and source code open source, but until it's done it's not really fit for public consumption!
When Quark One is working I hope to launch a larger campaign to fund their mass production. If it so happens that this campaign is really popular, I may fast track that dream!
    Risks & Challenges As with all engineering projects, there are potential risks and challenges. 
Luckily, being an avid electronics hobbyist and a qualified electronic engineer with several years experience, the technical aspects of the electronic design are of no concern.

All in all, the risks are low and the challenges are not severe. The success of Quark One is likely, if I can raise capital to produce prototypes. You may not be in a position to contribute funds, but please read on in case you have other skills that the Quark One project could use!

<h3>Introduction..<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
</div>
<div>
<span>We've created the world's first home security system that integrates face recognition.  Unlike other security systems that simply capture video and send an alert, Gadget captures a faceprint... a facial equivalent of the fingerprint.  Our software instantly analyzes the width, size and shape of the nose, the wideness of the eyes, the depth of the jaw, the height of the cheekbones, the distance between eyes and more. Everything is turned into a numerical code which can then be compared with other photos in the Gadget database.  Gadget can recognize family members and loved ones to grant access.  More importantly,  Gadget will let you know when someone else enters the house and will instantly send an email or text alert right to your phone.<br/>The applications for iCaptura go beyond the home.  For example, it can be used to take attendance at school or control authorised parking. It can  monitor temperature, humidity and air quality.  It can even detect unusual movements like fire and robbery.</span><div>

<h3>Who we are ? </h3>
<p><a href=""http://geniocode.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GenioCode, Inc</a> is
 an emerging IT company with a group of passionate individuals based out
 of Palo Alto, CA, United States . We dream of a world, where technology
 can provide solid solutions for a smarter and safer life. Our passion 
to support the public by bringing them the positive aspects of 
technology led to long days of brainstorming about an idea that 
culminated as  a product which works under the principle of FLNS (Face Locating and Notifying System) which we have filed a <b>patent </b>for.</p>
<p>We were initially focused on developing innovative games and apps for
 mobile platforms such as Incredible Finn and Kerala Kitchen, but 
something was missing.</p>
<p> Just turn on the news, crime is on the rise ... terrorist attacks, 
kidnappings, abduction – it’s more common place than ever before.  With 
this increase in terror around the world, we knew something needed to be
 done.  It was time to create something to make our world smarter and 
safer.  After much research and discussion, this ""Robot"" was born.</p>

                            A domestic security robot with face recognition...






Introduction..




We've created the world's first home security system that integrates face recognition.  Unlike other security systems that simply capture video and send an alert, Gadget captures a faceprint... a facial equivalent of the fingerprint.  Our software instantly analyzes the width, size and shape of the nose, the wideness of the eyes, the depth of the jaw, the height of the cheekbones, the distance between eyes and more. Everything is turned into a numerical code which can then be compared with other photos in the Gadget database.  Gadget can recognize family members and loved ones to grant access.  More importantly,  Gadget will let you know when someone else enters the house and will instantly send an email or text alert right to your phone.The applications for iCaptura go beyond the home.  For example, it can be used to take attendance at school or control authorised parking. It can  monitor temperature, humidity and air quality.  It can even detect unusual movements like fire and robbery.




iCaptura in a glance..      


                                    Why this robo ? Your single security companion



Whether you're at home, office, or travelling,  Gadget will always be keeping a watch for you. Gadget not only recognizes unauthorized persons but also unusual movements such as fire, robbery and the like. It can provide effective protection to your entire house/ office, day and night, without any additional sensor installations on other rooms/ floors.
No More False Alarms !





With its two dedicated cameras and intelligent notification technologies, it not only alerts you when something's wrong. You can even set safety parameters so certain activities are ignored for a period of time. 

Complete Control

 Gadget alerts you when something is wrong and lets you control the response.  Gadget sends instant email and MMS messages to connected personals along with the unauthorised person's image / unusual video clip, date, time and location, calling their attention. If required, iCaptura can alert your neighbours through email and MMS when you are away.

Your Workplace Attendance Record System




 Gadget automatically registers the attendance when an employee or student enters the institution premises through its integrated facial recognition system. It will also send the absentees record to the designated person through email and MMS.

Ultimate New - Age Auto Cop


Managing unauthorised parking and thefts are increasingly becoming a nightmare. Using Gadget you can now detect unauthorised vehicles through its integrated register number recognition facility. It will alert you when an unrecognised vehicle enters your premises. 

Cost - Effective Integrated Security Solution


The Gadget’s robust security features enables it to be integrated with your existing surveillance systems, making your private space hundred times more secure. When the normal surveillance system demands your continuous monitoring, Gadget's smart technology reacts to suspicious situations spontaneously. 
Innovative Design, Easy Installation




Security cameras fail to deter crime today by being very visible and intimidating. Unlike other electronic devices, Gadget’s innovative and delightful design makes it gel with the background keeping an eye on the action for you. 

There's a lot more in store !




Live Streaming





 Gadget provides live video streaming faster, easier and better than existing CCTV’s. The iCaptura secure mobile app enables you to keep a check on your home or office from anywhere in the world.



Auto Tracking




 Gadget lets you prevent robbery in shops, supermarkets and the like, by alerting the concerned personals at the counter with unusual movements that Gadget is programmed to detect. 


iCaptura Won't Fail You Even If Your Internet Does

 Gadget will always be on high alert and lets you know instantly when anything unusual happens, even if you’re not connected to the Internet! If Gadget is installed in the countries, where citizen details are recorded, then iCaptura can even tell who the intruder is with available details enabling Police to locate the offender easily.

Risks & Challenges 
We have been working to customize the algorithm to generate a perfect result. Our prototype is ready for final production. Our partners are ready to start. However, we understand that mass production of the product may encounter problems. We have plans to mitigate all the risks involved and have enlisted expert mentors who can guide us in our pursuit to break all the barriers.

We need to create tooling to manufacture different parts of the product. This process is complex, time consuming and expensive. Complications could potentially emerge and delay the manufacturing schedule. To tackle this risk, we have selected partners that can work closely with us through the whole process.
Software
The software prototype is ready and functional. We are now building all additional features that we want to include in iCaptura software. We trust our team to overcome all the challenges and keep moving forward. Our goal is to make the best possible product for you and deliver it on time.







  

Who we are ? 
GenioCode, Inc is
 an emerging IT company with a group of passionate individuals based out
 of Palo Alto, CA, United States . We dream of a world, where technology
 can provide solid solutions for a smarter and safer life. Our passion 
to support the public by bringing them the positive aspects of 
technology led to long days of brainstorming about an idea that 
culminated as  a product which works under the principle of FLNS (Face Locating and Notifying System) which we have filed a patent for.
We were initially focused on developing innovative games and apps for
 mobile platforms such as Incredible Finn and Kerala Kitchen, but 
something was missing.
 Just turn on the news, crime is on the rise ... terrorist attacks, 
kidnappings, abduction – it’s more common place than ever before.  With 
this increase in terror around the world, we knew something needed to be
 done.  It was time to create something to make our world smarter and 
safer.  After much research and discussion, this ""Robot"" was born.
The Team Behind...





                    “With the increase in terror and insecurity around the world, 
                                   we knew something needs to be done.
                                         And thus was born…The security Robot



How Can You Be A Part
                                                         



We've come a long way in our pursuit to provide a smart, effective and revolutionary solution to address all security concerns.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The founder of our company, Marvin Philip, hurt his back while working.  This not only caused Marvin to miss work, but it also made it difficult to do things at home such as bending over to empty his laundry hamper.</p>
<p>His injury lead him to search for a hamper that would not cause additional strain on his back.  Marvin searched everywhere in hopes of finding a product that would fulfill his needs.  He even solicited help from family members to find a hamper that would work for him.</p>

<p>1. Plant farmers are not familiar with fish. Spraying pesticides, 
fungicides and utilizing GMOs to maximize crop yield is much easier than
 transitioning to aquaponics.</p>
<p>2. Fish farmers are not familiar with growing plants. Using antibiotics, flushing out <b>billions</b> of gallons of waste filled water raising fish in a desert is much easier than aquaponics.</p>

<h1>OUR FOUNDERS MESSAGE TO YOU:</h1>
<p>Aquaponics is a clear solution to address many issues of water and 
food shortages all over the world and we hope the EcoQube can help bring
 this incredible yet simple solution into our everyday lives and 
influence the way we perceive the larger issues in the world today. We 
know there are these horrific things happening but we've been so 
disconnected with our environment and the negative impacts we make with 
our everyday decisions.</p>
<p>We know all these problems can't be solved immediately. We can't solve it with a fish tank no matter how beautiful it is, <b>but</b> we want to make an effort using what we're good at to take <b>the first steps in influencing you to make the world a better place.</b>
 We want to use the EcoQube as a vehicle to deliver the concept and 
beauty of aquaponics to as many people's lives as possible. To touch the
 minds and hearts of as many people as possible.</p>
<p><b>Because the crazy ones who think they can change the world are the ones who do. –Apple</b></p>

<p>Herbs and micro-greens can be extremely great filters and will thrive
 with the EcoQube, but for that same reason, it is EXTREMELY unsafe for 
food consumption. Chemicals used for aquariums are NOT safe for human 
consumption and the plants WILL soak these chemicals up. Consumption of 
the plants grown in the EcoQube is NOT recommended for humans.</p>
<p>International backers will NOT receive plant seeds or fish food as 
these are items regulated by customs strictly in many countries.</p><h2>Risks and Challenges</h2><p>We've spent most of the last year working with our partners to 
mitigate as many risks as possible, yet we know there will still be 
hurdles along the way. We will always be transparent with our community 
about challenges, including these:</p>
<p>The biggest risk is having users eat the herbs they've grown in their
 EcoQube. This is because professional aquaponics farms do not use 
regular aquarium chemicals for their water treatments. It is entirely 
unknown if chemicals from regular water treatments will find their way 
into the herbs. Also, aquariums with frogs, turtles, snails and other 
more disease-prone animals should not be eaten from. There are simply 
too many unknowns, and nobody wants a case of salmonella poisoning! It 
is not recommended to eat anything you produce through the EcoQube.</p>
<p>Ship date: We have built in extra time for the manufacturing process 
and are confident we will ship by the projected dates, but there is 
always a chance that things will take longer than planned.</p>
<p>Product changes: As we refine the EcoQube based on additional 
community feedback and more product testing, slight changes may be made.
 We'll only make changes that enhance the product experience. From 
feedback we've received, we already know that the light will be upgraded
 from a triangle to a rectangle with more LEDs to make it brighter for 
your ecosystem.</p>
<p>Supplier coordination: We work with a variety of suppliers to source 
the best materials and ensure the product is developed correctly. Each 
supplier has its own challenges, which may affect its partners, 
including us.</p>
<p>Maintenance: As hard as we've worked to make this AS LOW MAINTENANCE 
AS POSSIBLE, it is still a living ecosystem. As with all ecosystems, 
there can be imbalances like when your kids throw in a bag of fish food 
thinking the fish will grow faster, or if the aquarium is placed in the 
sun even though it comes with a beautiful bright light. Imbalances will 
cause algae growth and will require a tiny bit of wiping.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h4><b>What material is the aquarium in the EcoQube and what is the size?</b></h4>The dimensions of the tank you see are ~9.5""x7"". We are working on

We'd like the tank to be a 7x7 cube but we want to hear what you all 
think!<br/><br/>The tank you guys see is hand made from acrylic. For the final one, 
we are deciding between acrylic and polycarbonate for several reasons:<b><br/></b><b>          1. </b>Polycarbonate and acrylic are generally optically more clear than any glass that exists on the market right now.<br/><b><b>  </b><b>        </b>2. </b>To go along with our goal of beauty and perfection, we chose those
 2 types of materials because they will not require silicone to be 
mended together (less obtrusive material, and more beauty). It will 
actually likely cost more than glass because we would have to use more 
material since polycarbonate and acrylic is less rigid than glass.<br/><b>          3. </b>With our goal of being sustainable, we wanted to reuse as much 
material as possible and eliminate waste (like packaging). So our goal 
is actually to use the AQUARIUM as the PACKAGING. You can imagine glass 
to not be the best packaging during shipments when things are stacked.

<p>The internet generally suggests 10 gallons mainly because 10 gallons

 to put it in perspective, typical aquariums have little to no 
filtration. Think, would the fish prefer a larger tank like a mansion

with plants and the cleanest water they have ever been in? The 
aquaponics filter turns around a whopping 100 gallons of water per hour!</p>

<p>What we would suggest is start with 2 small zebra fish or minnows and

while using the same plants to clean aquarium water with ease!Already a Kickstarter success!We just need 150 more EcoQube orders to add the lightning functions (for both Kickstarter AND Indiegogo backers) that everyone's been asking for!(Image from National Geographic)How does the EcoQube work?The heart of the EcoQube is the 
aquaponics filter which uses plants, the world’s best and most natural 
filter, to keep your aquarium clean.
Why EcoQube?WELL DESIGNED - Built from scratch and 3D
 printed with every aspect examined and every detail refined. We worked 
extremely hard to build this from the ground up with a bigger purpose. 
So that we can scale this same filter for purposes like water sewage 
treatment, waste water clean-up and even filters for aquaculture.And integrated into the EcoQube!NEVER CHANGE OR REPLACE FILTERS AGAIN!- LOW MAINTENANCEINNOVATIVE - First ever: compact UV, filter with LED and 2"" filter that pump 100 gallons per hourBEAUTIFUL - Nature’s most exquisite decoration for any space.Our StoryOur names are Eric and Kevin. We’re UC San Diego students and 
aquarium geeks who met in high school and instantly became intrigued by 
planted aquatic ecosystems. As we got older, we realized the bigger 
challenges humanity as a whole faces in terms of food and water 
shortages so we decided to use our knowledge of aquariums to deliver the
 concept of aquaponics and the impact it can have to as many people as 
possible. Here's some background on us and what we've done:We started out working in various stores. Kevin actually served 
as a biologist assistant at the Steinhart Aquarium (California Academy 
of Sciences) where he managed and maintained 100,000 gallon systems as 
well as serve as the operations manager at Aquatic Central, the largest 
aquarium specific store in San Francisco. Eric was one of the first 
employees at Archaea International Corporation (DBA Aqua Forest 
Aquarium) also based in San Francisco where he focused on sales, 
customer relations and product user interface development.                Kevin's Garage at age 16.                             Our walk-in closet in college.
Eventually, we decided to start our own online aquarium store.And 
continued our passion for connecting people with nature through aquatic 
ecosystem installations. This installation was performed earlier this 
year in a restaurant where over 1000 people see and interact with it EVERYDAY.We brought our love of aquatic ecosystems with us to college, going 
from keeping aquariums in a garage in SF to a closet in San Diego. We 
decided against on-campus housing because we couldn't bear to part from 
our passion for aquariums. Right now, we create unique aquatic 
ecosystems for people in SF and SD, but we'd like to expand our reach to
 you through the EcoQube!
Solutions Farms (Vista, California) One of the LARGEST aquaponics farms in the US. Also where Kevin performed research on the sustainable cycle of Aquaponics.
Please support our mission by sharing the EcoQube with as many people
 as you know! You can learn more about us and see our story in pictures

Our GoalSo WHY is our food still grown in soil?
WHY are we throwing out billions of gallons of water every year from fish farming?
WHY do we need pesticides in our vegetables, antibiotics and 
hormones in our fish?! And whatever we don't consume, flush it out into 
the rivers and oceans?
1. Plant farmers are not familiar with fish. Spraying pesticides, 
fungicides and utilizing GMOs to maximize crop yield is much easier than
 transitioning to aquaponics.
2. Fish farmers are not familiar with growing plants. Using antibiotics, flushing out billions of gallons of waste filled water raising fish in a desert is much easier than aquaponics.
With easy access to anything we want whenever we want, we have lost connection with our food, the way it's grown, and the rest of the world. 
OUR FOUNDERS MESSAGE TO YOU:
Aquaponics is a clear solution to address many issues of water and 
food shortages all over the world and we hope the EcoQube can help bring
 this incredible yet simple solution into our everyday lives and 
influence the way we perceive the larger issues in the world today. We 
know there are these horrific things happening but we've been so 
disconnected with our environment and the negative impacts we make with 
our everyday decisions.
We know all these problems can't be solved immediately. We can't solve it with a fish tank no matter how beautiful it is, but we want to make an effort using what we're good at to take the first steps in influencing you to make the world a better place.
 We want to use the EcoQube as a vehicle to deliver the concept and 
beauty of aquaponics to as many people's lives as possible. To touch the
 minds and hearts of as many people as possible.
Because the crazy ones who think they can change the world are the ones who do. –Apple

Herbs and micro-greens can be extremely great filters and will thrive
 with the EcoQube, but for that same reason, it is EXTREMELY unsafe for 
food consumption. Chemicals used for aquariums are NOT safe for human 
consumption and the plants WILL soak these chemicals up. Consumption of 
the plants grown in the EcoQube is NOT recommended for humans.
International backers will NOT receive plant seeds or fish food as 
these are items regulated by customs strictly in many countries.Risks and ChallengesWe've spent most of the last year working with our partners to 
mitigate as many risks as possible, yet we know there will still be 
hurdles along the way. We will always be transparent with our community 
about challenges, including these:
The biggest risk is having users eat the herbs they've grown in their
 EcoQube. This is because professional aquaponics farms do not use 
regular aquarium chemicals for their water treatments. It is entirely 
unknown if chemicals from regular water treatments will find their way 
into the herbs. Also, aquariums with frogs, turtles, snails and other 
more disease-prone animals should not be eaten from. There are simply 
too many unknowns, and nobody wants a case of salmonella poisoning! It 
is not recommended to eat anything you produce through the EcoQube.
Ship date: We have built in extra time for the manufacturing process 
and are confident we will ship by the projected dates, but there is 
always a chance that things will take longer than planned.
Product changes: As we refine the EcoQube based on additional 
community feedback and more product testing, slight changes may be made.
 We'll only make changes that enhance the product experience. From 
feedback we've received, we already know that the light will be upgraded
 from a triangle to a rectangle with more LEDs to make it brighter for 
your ecosystem.
Supplier coordination: We work with a variety of suppliers to source 
the best materials and ensure the product is developed correctly. Each 
supplier has its own challenges, which may affect its partners, 
including us.
Maintenance: As hard as we've worked to make this AS LOW MAINTENANCE 
AS POSSIBLE, it is still a living ecosystem. As with all ecosystems, 
there can be imbalances like when your kids throw in a bag of fish food 
thinking the fish will grow faster, or if the aquarium is placed in the 
sun even though it comes with a beautiful bright light. Imbalances will 
cause algae growth and will require a tiny bit of wiping.FAQWhat material is the aquarium in the EcoQube and what is the size?The dimensions of the tank you see are ~9.5""x7"". We are working on 
finalizing the dimensions based on YOUR feedback! We will post an update
 where you guys can vote by commenting towards the end of the campaign. 
We'd like the tank to be a 7x7 cube but we want to hear what you all 
think!The tank you guys see is hand made from acrylic. For the final one, 
we are deciding between acrylic and polycarbonate for several reasons:          1. Polycarbonate and acrylic are generally optically more clear than any glass that exists on the market right now.          2. To go along with our goal of beauty and perfection, we chose those
 2 types of materials because they will not require silicone to be 
mended together (less obtrusive material, and more beauty). It will 
actually likely cost more than glass because we would have to use more 
material since polycarbonate and acrylic is less rigid than glass.          3. With our goal of being sustainable, we wanted to reuse as much 
material as possible and eliminate waste (like packaging). So our goal 
is actually to use the AQUARIUM as the PACKAGING. You can imagine glass 
to not be the best packaging during shipments when things are stacked.

Sarah and Elliott would love for all of our family and friends to have the opportunity to contribute to such a unique project. 
Sarah has a wide range of experience within architecture and residential design. She has worked in various Architectural practices in London and Spain. Where she has developed schemes for planning applications for both private residential and commercial use, researched and specified products for client approval, worked on tender drawings for projects of varying scale. Most recently she managed the development of a residential refurbishment in Bloomsbury, which has recently completed on site. This project would allow Sarah to further develop her skills and career with this highly personal project!
Sarah and Elliott are excited to build something together and would love your help to make it  happen.     Risks & Challenges  
Budget is our biggest obstacle currently, we need to secure funding to get a self build mortgage to enable the build to happen. 
Gaining planning permission will be another challenge, as the project is relatively small and residential we would hope for a positive outcome. If we do not get planning permission, we will use find another location to enable us to complete the project. 
Most self-build projects will face a variety of problems and hurdles! We believe that with our design experience and problem solving skills, we should be able to combat them. Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute, that doesn't mean that you can't help:
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about the campaign.
Use the Indiegogo share tools to let others know about the campaign!
And that's all there is to it! Sarah and Elliott x",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

If you are unsure, email us pictures of your fuse box and we will help you!<br/><br/><i>- Electric radiators</i> – These come in different versions:</p><ul>
<li>1-phase radiators (230 V) – You have one single fuse for each radiator or group of radiators. Check the number of fuses in your fuse box.</li>
<li>2-phase radiators (380 – 400 V) – You have two fuses connected to the radiators and for perfect monitoring and control you need two Tempiro Smart Fuses for each group of radiators. It is common practice that three fuses are connected to a larger group of radiators – then you need three Smart Fuses.</li>
</ul><p>- <i>Electric heat boiler (hydronic heating system)</i> – You normally need three fuses as this is a three-phase device.</p><p>- <i>Heat pumps </i>– Smaller heat pumps are connected to a single fuse while more powerful units are connected to three fuses. Check your fuse box to be sure.</p><p><strong>Q: What type of electric heating can I control with Tempiro’s solution?<br/>A:</strong> Basically, any type of electric heating can be turned on and off through the fuses. Radiators, convectors, floor heating, infrared heating panels, convector heating and underfloor heating can be perfectly controlled through our app! <br/>For air sourced heat pumps, you need to be sure the heat pump can automatically be turned on again after a power cut.<br/>We currently do not recommend Tempiro temperature control for ground sourced and hydronic heat pumps. However you can use the Tempiro Smart Fuse to monitor how much electricity these devices use and to remotely turn them on and off – just make sure that the heat pump turns back on after a power cut.</p><p><strong>Q: Besides heating, which other equipment can I control and monitor using Tempiro Smart Fuse?<br/>A:</strong> Tempiro offers special features for controlling heating but you can use Tempiro Smart Fuse to control any kind of equipment such as kitchen appliances, lights, ventilation, electric boilers, among many others. You can also cut power to a selected phase remotely, allowing you to e.g. switch off all appliances connected to that phase.</p><p><strong>Q: What kind of monitoring do I get with Tempiro?<br/>A:</strong>The smart fuses will monitor electricity usage and how much electricity is currently going through your fuses. Visualizing this information will help you to better control your energy use, which will allow your to reduce your electricity cost!<br/>If a fuse is tripped and power disappears, our app will notify you. This will help you take suitable action to safeguard heating and potentially avoiding expensive damages.<br/>Our temperature sensor will monitor the temperature in your house and alert you if it drops below desired level, also protecting the well-being of your house.</p><p><strong>Q: How much can I reduce my heating costs?<br/>A:</strong>Just by scheduling your temperature in order to keep the temperature low when you are not at home or while you are sleeping, you can save 10% of your heating costs. <br/>Tempiro will also incorporate further smart heating features in the Tempiro App which will enable you to heat your house when the price of electricity is lower (depending on your country of residence and electricity contract). This can further reduce your bill by 10 – 20%.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use the Tempiro solution at my home or holiday house even though there is no Internet connection available there?<br/>A:</strong> Yes, you can! We offer a 3G USB modem for our gateway as an option. It costs €35 extra. Then you also need a 3G subscription, which you can either purchase yourself or you can get from us for only €5/month (Scandinavia only).</p><p><strong>Q: What happens if the power or the internet connection goes out?<br/>A:</strong> The gateway will keep operating with the last settings received, set temperature will be held. But obviously remote control will cease to work if the connection is lost.</p><p><strong>Q: What type of fuses can I control and monitor?<br/>A:</strong> The Tempiro Smart Fuse fits the D-type DII (Diazed) fuses. This means it fits the fuse displayed in the picture below. It fits all fuses of this sort rated up to 25 A, but our device is rated for max 16 A so do not install it on 20 A or 25 A fuses unless you are sure your peak load is max 16 A.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510242020/pz5dxgy5dju9npgc1x2v.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Q: I only have circuit breakers in my fuse box, can I still use Tempiro’s solution?<br/>A:</strong> If your fuse box (consumer unit) only contain miniature circuit breaker, you cannot install Tempiro’s Smart Fuse there (see picture below). In e.g. Sweden and Finland the three main fuses of the house are still of Diazed type. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510248317/vtfo8l7lhd835y2xhwg0.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Q: In which countries can I control my fuses with Tempiro?<br/>A:</strong> We know that our smart fuses work in the following country: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia, Albania, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. They would work as long as you still have the old standard ceramic diazed fuses descripted above.<br/>It might be possible that they also work in other countries that have not being mentioned before. <br/>In Denmark a smaller fuse version called Neozed (D0) is used. We do not support this version yet. <br/>If you are unsure if Tempiro will work for you, take a picture of your fuse box (consumer unit) and email it to info@tempiro.com. We’d love to help you! <br/>Of course we will reimburse your order if it turns out that Tempiro doesn’t work with the type of fuses you have at home. </p><p><strong>Q: I live in the USA, UK or France. Can I control my fuses with Tempiro?<br/>A:</strong> Unfortunately, the Tempiro Smart Fuse is not compatible with the type of fuses used in those countries. But you can still support us by purchasing other perks such as the Zigbee Smoke Detector!</p><p><strong>Q: What range does Tempiro wireless communication offer?<br/>A:</strong> The Tempiro solution is completely wireless, enabling a quick and easy installation. The standard range of the radio we are using is 20 meters indoors. Nevertheless this depends on the type of construction: reinforced concrete limits the range while a house made of wood and plaster offer longer range. We suggest that the gateway is placed close to the fuse box, keeping the temperature sensor within 10 – 20 meters from the gateway.</p><p><strong>Q: Do I need to replace my existing fuse box in order to install Tempiro?<br/>A:</strong> Tempiro fits into your existing fuse box as long as you have a traditional fuse box of Central European and Scandinavian type ( the so-called diazed fuse box type DII). These are common in houses built until the 90’s. If you live in this part of the world and have a fuse box where you replace tripped fuses, it is a fit!</p><p><strong>Q: Do I need an electrical installation to set up Tempiro?<br/>A:</strong>Tempiro is easy to install by yourself, as easy as changing a fuse. No need for an electrician.</p><p><strong>Q: Will Tempiro support all versions of Android and iOS devices? And what about Windows Phone?<br/>A:</strong>Tempiro will support all current versions of iOS and common Android versions. We are currently not launching any app for Windows Phone.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use multiple phones with Tempiro?<br/>A:</strong>You can download our app to any number of phones without any cost. You use the same account on every phone connected to the same system.</p><p><strong>Q: With which home automation systems is Tempiro compatible?<br/>A:</strong>If you like to just purchase just the Tempiro Smart Fuse you can use it with any smart home gateway that supports Zigbee Homeautomation HA 1.2 e.g. Samsung SmartThings. The Smart Fuse will appear as a Zigbee Smart Plug to your home automation system.</p><p><strong>Q: How will you know where to ship my perk?<br/>A:</strong>We will send a survey to all backers once our initial funding period on Indiegogo has officially ended requesting all necessary information for shipping your perks to you.</p><p><strong>Q: Where do you deliver and what are the shipping costs?<br/>A:</strong> Since our product can only be used in Europe, this is where we will deliver. Shipping cost will be between €10–30 depending on package and your location. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs or additional costs associated with your country. </p><p><strong>Q: When is the soonest I can get Tempiro delivered?<br/>A:</strong> Estimated shipping dates for the device begin in January 2018.</p></div>","Introducing  TempiroFit Tempiro smart solution into your fuse box and start enjoying automated smart home control from anywhere.

1-phase radiators (230 V) – You have one single fuse for each radiator or group of radiators. Check the number of fuses in your fuse box.
2-phase radiators (380 – 400 V) – You have two fuses connected to the radiators and for perfect monitoring and control you need two Tempiro Smart Fuses for each group of radiators. It is common practice that three fuses are connected to a larger group of radiators – then you need three Smart Fuses.
- Electric heat boiler (hydronic heating system) – You normally need three fuses as this is a three-phase device.- Heat pumps – Smaller heat pumps are connected to a single fuse while more powerful units are connected to three fuses. Check your fuse box to be sure.Q: What type of electric heating can I control with Tempiro’s solution?A: Basically, any type of electric heating can be turned on and off through the fuses. Radiators, convectors, floor heating, infrared heating panels, convector heating and underfloor heating can be perfectly controlled through our app! For air sourced heat pumps, you need to be sure the heat pump can automatically be turned on again after a power cut.We currently do not recommend Tempiro temperature control for ground sourced and hydronic heat pumps. However you can use the Tempiro Smart Fuse to monitor how much electricity these devices use and to remotely turn them on and off – just make sure that the heat pump turns back on after a power cut.Q: Besides heating, which other equipment can I control and monitor using Tempiro Smart Fuse?A: Tempiro offers special features for controlling heating but you can use Tempiro Smart Fuse to control any kind of equipment such as kitchen appliances, lights, ventilation, electric boilers, among many others. You can also cut power to a selected phase remotely, allowing you to e.g. switch off all appliances connected to that phase.Q: What kind of monitoring do I get with Tempiro?A:The smart fuses will monitor electricity usage and how much electricity is currently going through your fuses. Visualizing this information will help you to better control your energy use, which will allow your to reduce your electricity cost!If a fuse is tripped and power disappears, our app will notify you. This will help you take suitable action to safeguard heating and potentially avoiding expensive damages.Our temperature sensor will monitor the temperature in your house and alert you if it drops below desired level, also protecting the well-being of your house.Q: How much can I reduce my heating costs?A:Just by scheduling your temperature in order to keep the temperature low when you are not at home or while you are sleeping, you can save 10% of your heating costs. Tempiro will also incorporate further smart heating features in the Tempiro App which will enable you to heat your house when the price of electricity is lower (depending on your country of residence and electricity contract). This can further reduce your bill by 10 – 20%.Q: Can I use the Tempiro solution at my home or holiday house even though there is no Internet connection available there?A: Yes, you can! We offer a 3G USB modem for our gateway as an option. It costs €35 extra. Then you also need a 3G subscription, which you can either purchase yourself or you can get from us for only €5/month (Scandinavia only).Q: What happens if the power or the internet connection goes out?A: The gateway will keep operating with the last settings received, set temperature will be held. But obviously remote control will cease to work if the connection is lost.Q: What type of fuses can I control and monitor?A: The Tempiro Smart Fuse fits the D-type DII (Diazed) fuses. This means it fits the fuse displayed in the picture below. It fits all fuses of this sort rated up to 25 A, but our device is rated for max 16 A so do not install it on 20 A or 25 A fuses unless you are sure your peak load is max 16 A.Q: I only have circuit breakers in my fuse box, can I still use Tempiro’s solution?A: If your fuse box (consumer unit) only contain miniature circuit breaker, you cannot install Tempiro’s Smart Fuse there (see picture below). In e.g. Sweden and Finland the three main fuses of the house are still of Diazed type. Q: In which countries can I control my fuses with Tempiro?A: We know that our smart fuses work in the following country: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia, Albania, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria. They would work as long as you still have the old standard ceramic diazed fuses descripted above.It might be possible that they also work in other countries that have not being mentioned before. In Denmark a smaller fuse version called Neozed (D0) is used. We do not support this version yet. If you are unsure if Tempiro will work for you, take a picture of your fuse box (consumer unit) and email it to info@tempiro.com. We’d love to help you! Of course we will reimburse your order if it turns out that Tempiro doesn’t work with the type of fuses you have at home. Q: I live in the USA, UK or France. Can I control my fuses with Tempiro?A: Unfortunately, the Tempiro Smart Fuse is not compatible with the type of fuses used in those countries. But you can still support us by purchasing other perks such as the Zigbee Smoke Detector!Q: What range does Tempiro wireless communication offer?A: The Tempiro solution is completely wireless, enabling a quick and easy installation. The standard range of the radio we are using is 20 meters indoors. Nevertheless this depends on the type of construction: reinforced concrete limits the range while a house made of wood and plaster offer longer range. We suggest that the gateway is placed close to the fuse box, keeping the temperature sensor within 10 – 20 meters from the gateway.Q: Do I need to replace my existing fuse box in order to install Tempiro?A: Tempiro fits into your existing fuse box as long as you have a traditional fuse box of Central European and Scandinavian type ( the so-called diazed fuse box type DII). These are common in houses built until the 90’s. If you live in this part of the world and have a fuse box where you replace tripped fuses, it is a fit!Q: Do I need an electrical installation to set up Tempiro?A:Tempiro is easy to install by yourself, as easy as changing a fuse. No need for an electrician.Q: Will Tempiro support all versions of Android and iOS devices? And what about Windows Phone?A:Tempiro will support all current versions of iOS and common Android versions. We are currently not launching any app for Windows Phone.Q: Can I use multiple phones with Tempiro?A:You can download our app to any number of phones without any cost. You use the same account on every phone connected to the same system.Q: With which home automation systems is Tempiro compatible?A:If you like to just purchase just the Tempiro Smart Fuse you can use it with any smart home gateway that supports Zigbee Homeautomation HA 1.2 e.g. Samsung SmartThings. The Smart Fuse will appear as a Zigbee Smart Plug to your home automation system.Q: How will you know where to ship my perk?A:We will send a survey to all backers once our initial funding period on Indiegogo has officially ended requesting all necessary information for shipping your perks to you.Q: Where do you deliver and what are the shipping costs?A: Since our product can only be used in Europe, this is where we will deliver. Shipping cost will be between €10–30 depending on package and your location. Shipment does not include extra fees from customs or additional costs associated with your country. Q: When is the soonest I can get Tempiro delivered?A: Estimated shipping dates for the device begin in January 2018.",13.0,3,"1 Campaign

WAUL is the world's first ergonomic carrier. This is unforgettable using experience as for you as for your pet. Every element presents the thoughtful construction of pet luxury transport. Have you ever seen something similar in this area? We believe – not.
8 REASONS TO USE WAUL PET CARRIER:

 Futuristic design
 Ergonomics
 Comfort for your pet 
 Built-in toy 
 Blanket included 
 Non-toxic, non-allergic plastic 
 Top loading door 
 Great all-round ventilationLet's see all the details, shall we:

""WAUL Studio has changed the pet carrier game forever thanks to their new spaceship-looking cat carrier. Plus, it looks so cool your cat won't even mind that they're being carried to the vet."" - Kayla Bazile, Mashable""This futuristic-looking pet carrier will make your cat look like a sci-fi pilot while staying comfy."" - Bonnie Burton, CNET""Most carriers are boring plastic shaped boxes with a grill on the front. These guys wanted something a little different for their little alien. And so Waul, a space ship looking carrier was born."" - Evie, Cool Stuff for Cats Materials: We use non-toxic, non-allergenic plastic. Our team went through multiple iterations for choosing the safest and durable material while keeping pets in mind. It includes a soft cosy pet mat that's removable and machine washable. 

*The shooting was conducted by a hidden camera on a cat exhibition
Ergonomics: You probably have had a number of pet carriers over the years. And if you are like us then you find that you constantly hit your legs with them. They are also heavy to carry, especially if you have a rather chunky cat.We’ve constructed a carrier for your comfort. The curved body helps you move freely and it does not cling to your leg. Shaped form is an ideal for seat belts.Top loading door with a wide opening and secure latch makes loading & unloading your pet twice as easy and quickly!  Easy entry helps promote a less stressful experience - for both you and your pet. It offers strength, security, and visibility, along with plenty of ventilation. Once the pet is safely inside, a handle on the top allows for easy, one-handed carrying.Design: the thoughtful, innovative design was inspired by the transport of the future. The concept was developed by two designers over 3 months to find out the right form and colour. Through every step of product's creation, we’ve held your and pet's needs at the core of everything. Redesigning over and over every element and functional detail, to ensure we’ve created the very best and innovative pet carrier in futuristic design. Why hard side carrier? Such carrier is easier to clean if your cat has an accident. It's stronger and a better option for cats and dogs that hate being in a carrier and try to claw or chew their way out.Comfort for your pet: research has shown that cats and dogs — predators by nature — like a place in which to hide and observe their surroundings without being spotted or disturbed. The lack of bars satisfies a pet's natural instinct to feel protected, while the transparent window allows pets to watch the outside world. Entertainment: built-in toy imitates pilot dashboard in a cockpit and entertains your pet during the trips. Peek-a-boo track design allows your pet to see, chase and swat the ball. Swirl patterned ball's special colour combination specifically designed to catch and attract cat's attention. 
 

 




The lid locking system. There is a simple hidden locking mechanism. To open the carrier it's necessary to press the button under the lid. Also, there are small magnets in the carrier body and in the lid. The lid sits tight with the help of magnets​The handle. We created a special mechanism that lets to use the handle with ease. It is similar to telescoping handles system. When the handle is in the down position the handle is hidden - pull it up in the upper position and carry your pet. The handle is fixed in the upper position. So it would be comfortable to carry a carrier even if your pet moves a lot inside of it. You can see the mechanism on the picture below.

The final product's dimensions are: 22.8"" L x 11.8"" W x 12.5"" H in // 58 L x 30 W x 32 H cm. Most of the pet carriers have such dimensions. So standard cat can sit in there. You can use Waul Pet Carrier whenever you want, here are some cases:• Going to caffe • Going to veterinar • Traveling • Walking to a park • Going to pet exhibition • Going to relatives for a couple days • Moving to another house • Going to countryhouse • Going to pet barbershop How to get your cat used for a carrierIf you are planning a trip, leave the carrier open so your cat can explore it. Cats are naturally curious, and many love to explore small spaces such as boxes. If you put treats in there, or a familiar smelling towel, or even feed your cat inside the carrier you can create that positive association for him.
