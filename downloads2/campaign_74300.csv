<h4>What we are doing</h4>
<p>Born out of love for the small city, The Crossing Guide is a
glimpse into the culture of small vibrant communities in the Northwest. Each
story is a puzzle piece that is only a part of the larger city picture. We
feature stores such as outdoors, local art, theatre, city experiences, original
tales dreamed up by our talented writers, music, food, and shopping to only
name a few. Our finger is constantly on the pulse of the goings-on in Whatcom,
Skagit, Island and Snohomish counties and we want to share our findings with
you. Think of us as your friend in the Northwest.</p>
<h4>Who we are</h4>
<p>We are a 100 page glossy magazine with grand personality. Our
team is a collection of writers, designers, and locals who share the same goal
of expressing what makes our communities great. Located in Bellingham, WA we
are in a prime location to reach out to our Canadian neighbors. </p>
<h4>Our goal</h4>
<p>Right now we are in the process of finalizing the posh
personality of the publication. As a small locally owned business, we just need
a final push to get us to the end. That’s where you come in.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help fund our printing,
distribution, and operational expenses. No matter how big or small of a donation,
each dollar will help bring us one step closer to sharing our community
culture. </p>
<p>Help us turn our dream of sharing our communities with our
Northern neighbors into a reality. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In July of 2011, Jon Brence (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/smbctheater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""SMBC Theater"">SMBC Theater</a>) and Charlotte Parker (Cosplayer/Writer) discussed creating a site that would bring together geeks of all walks of life. The goal was to create an online hub that was community driven, with original personal perspective articles, original videos, live broadcasts, and more that engaged the geeks and otaku of the world in thought-provoking discussion.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Since it's launch, <a href=""http://www.ogeeku.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Ogeeku"">Ogeeku.com</a> has amassed a great number of registered active members from around the world and maintains a steady flow of visitors. We have actively produced multiple <a href=""http://www.ogeeku.com/live"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Ogeeku Live!"">live broadcasts</a> weekly for the past few months, began <a href=""http://www.ogeeku.com/o2b"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Our 2 Bits"">an original series</a>, and provided daily content, all out of our own pockets and love for everything geek.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.ogeeku.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Ogeeku"">Ogeeku.com</a> presents a unique opportunity for geeks and otaku alike to share their thoughts and ideas on a larger scale than before. It opens the possibility for any community member to have their thoughts/creations/broadcasts featured front page of a website, seen by thousands of visitors on a daily basis. The site encourages friendships and family to be formed for those who may not have many people with whom to share their love of anime, manga, or gaming. It has a built in socializing platform, forums, and chat room for continued discussions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Ultimately, the site has the opportunity to become the ultimate hub for the geek-minded.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As of right now, Ogeeku is currently funded by donations from community members and the few ads we run on the site. <strike>As a result, we are only able to afford a cluster-based server, which may mean occasional downtime or periods of slow load time (depending on the load shared with other websites).</strike></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strike>To avoid issues such as the above, we want to first move the site to a dedicated server. </strike></p>
<p><strike><br/></strike></p>
<p>Secondly, we want to spend more time on the site's design and functionality (incorporating new social integration, custom forums, custom front pages for each user, and cleaner code). Third, we want to upgrade our live broadcasts on <a href=""http://www.ogeeku.com/live"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Ogeeku Live!"">Ogeeku Live!</a> to be full HD (1080p), so that we have the best quality feed to feature our hosts/special guests and their playthroughs. <strike> And last, but not least, we want to launch an online store, which features unique one-of-a-kind items made by Ogeeku staff and community members.</strike></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have estimated that in combination with our current sources of funding, we will need approximately $3000 to achieve this for the next 6 months. Your donation will go towards all of the above efforts.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>A non-profit community center for people with disabilities and their families...</strong></p>
<p>Our son was severely injured Afghanistan, suffering numerous physical injuries and severe traumatic brain injury (causing significant cognitive impairment). We've struggled through years of recovery, and will for many more.</p>
<p>What we have discovered these last few years is that people with disabilities need a place where they can go that offers the full spectrum of resources to make their lives better; everything in one place, and that place just for them, their families and caregivers.</p>
<p>The <strong>Greybeard Community Center</strong> is to be a<strong> </strong>facility where members can attend exercise programs of all kinds, those directly related to therapy and recovery, as well as general activity programs. They can take classes, both related to navigating through disability issues and general courses. In addition to the classroom, there will be an activity floor, a therapy pool, an exercise room, therapy room, media center, a snack bar, and more.</p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have developed a business plan, designed the facility, and itemized the equipment, materials and supplies lists.</p>
<p>We've detailed the staffing requirements, and will be working with the local community to hire persons with disabilities.</p>
<p>Minimum startup costs required to open the doors are <strong>$90,000</strong>, with ongoing costs through the first year approximately $23,000 per month.</p>
<p>While many of the clients will be provided services at low- or no-cost, we do calculate non-profit income from memberships, classroom programs, activity floor programs, concession sales, day pass admissions, and miscellaneous purchases. This income stream will offset operating expenses, more so each month until the center is self-supporting.</p>
<p>The funds from this campaign are intended to open the doors, while those from other funding sources (i.e. <a href=""http://www.greybeardpublishing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">greybeard publishing</a>), along with the income stream, will keep the doors open through the first year until we are truly self-supporting.</p>
<p>Additional funding beyond the goal would give us more flexibility when we first open the doors. Less funding would give us a bit less to work with initially but we would utilize this campaign's funds along with greybeard publishing's funding support to the best advantage and help those who are most in need.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage contributors and patrons of the Greybeard Community Center to become involved in the ongoing activities of the center, to participate in support roles directly or through one of the websites. A number of professionials in the field of disability support have stated their intentions to assist us and even volunteer their time and expertise.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>We see a real need for this, and that need is only going to grow. While there are facilities and offices with sincere staff that may offer one service or another, there is no single facility that provides the full spectrum of services, and finding any one service can be difficult.</p>
<p>Our multi-purpose community center is unique in that it serves those living with a disability and, as importantly, their families and caregivers.</p>
<p>We desperately need a place like this. We know this. We have felt it. Hundreds in our community need this place. Our son needs this place. We want this kid to have a place to go. And we want him to get better.</p>

With the rising prices of gas these days, this would save people money by giving them a local place to go to instead of having to drive for miles to get to anything entertaining. It would also give people an inclination to get out of their houses and meet new people, as well as friends, in a place that is both welcoming and comfortable. We want people to be able to socialize in a place that isn't a social network but a network of fellow enthusiasts in a social environment!</p><p><b>It would go beyond just entertainment.</b></p><p>It would help create new jobs in our area, something that is sorely needed, and in addition, help support our regional economy through taxes that would go back into the county and state. </p><p>We would also do charitable work in the region by having the A.R.C. Studio's Cosplayers dress as everyone's favorite superheros and visit children in local and regional hospitals bringing kids happiness and hope and also appear at charity events giving back to the community. <br/></p><p>The events and tournaments we host could also bring in many out-of-town customers that could in turn equal additional customers and clientele for surrounding businesses in the region.</p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/></p><p>The risks and challenges involved with starting Xion are:</p><ul><li><b>Will there be a demand for the services offered by Xion in the city of Bainbridge or the Southwest GA region?</b></li></ul><p>Yes.  Without driving at the least an hour, and into another state, the services XION has to offers is not available anywhere else in our region, This will also help to support local economic growth and stimulus.</p><ul><li><b>Will the popularity of the Geek culture continue to grow, or is it merely a fad? </b></li></ul><p>As long as comic books and movies are around, there will always be someone looking to further their fandom.

There are many people who are members of clubs at Bainbridge State College that would like to see a shop like ours in the area. They are already driving to shops in Tallahassee, FL and Dothan, AL. We would be able to supply them with a place that is local and keep our regional economy stronger by keeping those tax dollars in our own state and county.</p><p></p><ul><li><b>Will you still open XION if you do not succeed in reaching your goal?</b></li></ul><div>Yes.

The level of backing that you choose will be the level that you will start at when the shop opens, after the campaign is over everyone else from that point on will start off as a Level 0. This is a chance to get a jump start on earning future rewards once we open. I hope this will encourage you to become a backer and help us create the paradise for geeks that we all want. XION.We will have a Wall of Fame in Xion that will include a special permanent place exclusively to thank those who back us here! This is will be dedicated to all of you who help make this geek paradise become a reality.We will also have legendary special guest from across the geek community that will appear at our Grand Opening. As we reach a few check points, we will continue to update and let you know who or what you can expect to be there! Our first special guest(s) will be announced after we reach the $5,000 mark and we will continue to announce more at every $5,000 increment!If we are unsuccessful in our goal, we will try again and continue to raise the capitol needed to make Xion. The money collected will go into the funding pool. Don't give up on us if we don't make it at first, because we won't give up on you or your fandom! The store will still be opening it will just take longer. We project around March 2015 if we are unsuccessful here. All contributions will still be honored that comes through here! The Impact on our AreaI feel like this is something that we geeks and southwest Georgia region, as a community, could use for entertainment and socialization. With the rising prices of gas these days, this would save people money by giving them a local place to go to instead of having to drive for miles to get to anything entertaining. It would also give people an inclination to get out of their houses and meet new people, as well as friends, in a place that is both welcoming and comfortable. We want people to be able to socialize in a place that isn't a social network but a network of fellow enthusiasts in a social environment!It would go beyond just entertainment.It would help create new jobs in our area, something that is sorely needed, and in addition, help support our regional economy through taxes that would go back into the county and state. We would also do charitable work in the region by having the A.R.C. Studio's Cosplayers dress as everyone's favorite superheros and visit children in local and regional hospitals bringing kids happiness and hope and also appear at charity events giving back to the community. The events and tournaments we host could also bring in many out-of-town customers that could in turn equal additional customers and clientele for surrounding businesses in the region.Risks & ChallengesThe risks and challenges involved with starting Xion are:Will there be a demand for the services offered by Xion in the city of Bainbridge or the Southwest GA region?Yes.  Without driving at the least an hour, and into another state, the services XION has to offers is not available anywhere else in our region, This will also help to support local economic growth and stimulus.Will the popularity of the Geek culture continue to grow, or is it merely a fad? As long as comic books and movies are around, there will always be someone looking to further their fandom. We want to be the ones meeting that need.Is there a client base already existing in the area?Yes. There are many people who are members of clubs at Bainbridge State College that would like to see a shop like ours in the area. They are already driving to shops in Tallahassee, FL and Dothan, AL. We would be able to supply them with a place that is local and keep our regional economy stronger by keeping those tax dollars in our own state and county.Will you still open XION if you do not succeed in reaching your goal?Yes. We will we are putting $25,000.00 dollars into this project ourselves and will be opening at the latest March of 2015. If we are successful, however, we will be shooting to have our Grand Opening in September 2014! Moving the timeline forward quite a bit and giving you an even better experience and environment than we alone could offer.We are confident in our past success from using a crowd-funding source to start our creative label ARC Studios (Altered Reality Creative Studios) and comic series (The Fog Walkers) that we had successfully funded. We met our goal to get the first comic finished and have succeeded in creating two more with the revenue we earned. We are now on Issue 3 of The Fog Walkers in print and are currently working on Issue 4!We also successfully distributed all of our rewards on time to the backers that helped us achieve our goal. We cannot do this project without your support and as lofty as our goals may be, I believe we can achieve it!After all, this is not just our shop, it is a place for customer to come and celebrate what they enjoy and be themselves!Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't help financially, you can help us by getting the word out and spreading it across the social media like wildfire! Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Instagram, etc...Anyway you can get the word out please do! We will also need some help setting up the shop when it is time to do so!",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Support The Super Talented 5yo Maddison Teylor of <i>Maddsterpieces</i>!</b><br/></p>
<div>Maddison is a very talented, and rather shy 5yo who immerses herself into drawing and painting daily, and not because she doesn't want to clean up her toys. After being told over&amp; over from friends and strangers alike that she <i>""will be an artist when she grows up,""</i> she turned to me one day and said: <i>""why do I have to wait until I grow up? I already <b>AM</b> one.""</i>
</div>
<div>She has been given an opportunity to feature (and sell!) her awesome work (her art, not her toy cleaning abilities, that is) in a very popular upcoming arts and crafts festival in our area, and she is taking it very seriously. She has a ton of beautiful ideas floating around in her (equally beautiful) head, but she doesn't have the money in her cute little piggy bank (which is actually a pony, but I digress) to buy the quality art supplies she needs in order to have those pieces ready to sell at the art festival. She tried to buy some canvases the other day, but the cashier said they don't take pocket lint :(  Oh well, those canvases *were* too big for her to carry anyway. </div> </div> <div> <h3>

<h3>What She Needs:</h3>
<p>Maddison needs funding with real money, not monopoly dollars- to cover the cost of supplies she will use making even more awesome work, as well as to produce prints of her work and package up these items for customers. However, if you want to send us your monopoly money, she would happily incorporate that into a collage too. </p>
<p>In total, she needs about $100 to do a whole run of her marvelous prints (plus she needs some new strawberry bubble gum because the puppy ate all of hers AGAIN, but I digress). Indiegogo won't let us ask for less than $500, so that's what we've set the minimum as. With $100, she can at get started using some professional supplies and have something to sell her many adoring fans at the festival. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact of Your Donation:</h3>
<div>Maddison is a very sweet and talented kid, and I'm not just saying that because I'm her mother. Her work brings smiles to people's faces, which can be scary because sometimes they have bad breath (I'm looking at you, upstairs neighbor!) It also brings joy to their hearts, and sometimes to their bathroom walls if that's where they choose to display it (cough, KP, cough;).</div>
<div> It is wonderful to see  her gaining confidence as strangers admire her beautiful work and talk about her excellent choice of color schemes (whatever that means), and to imagine the potential growth she will have as an artist over the coming years as she pursues this passion further (and simultaneously goes through a lot of bubble gum). </div>
<div>Her work has recently caught the eye of several noteworthy artists via social media, who were probably just sharing it because it made them feel better about themselves, but still. She apparently has a real chance at getting her work into galleries and doing this professionally- partly because it comes so naturally to her, and partly because she doesn't really give a crap about what people think or what color schemes even mean. She is five after all. She cares more about whether or not she has to brush her teeth at night than she does what people think! </div>

</div><div> <p>There is always the chance that people won't like Maddison's art. It happens to all artists sometimes. Especially when you have ketchup on your shirt ON PURPOSE and cover yourself in temporary tattoos of smiling poop- this can be completely awkward in social situations. But the best thing about being 5 is that you don't really care what others think about your art because YOU KNOW IT'S AWESOME! YAH!

<p><b>An Odyssey of Smoked Meats</b></p>
<p>Growing up an Army brat, we traveled.<span>  The scenery changed but our<br/>love of food remained constant.  Of the fare to be had, hams were always sampled every which place we settled in for a meal. From the smokey and rich Black Forest ham, to the lightly sweet and tender French ham; we tried them all. </span></p>
<p>As an adult on my own I spent time in Alaska. There I had the pleasure of learning to smoke salmon. After spending many hours tending to the smoker with 100's of pounds of fresh beautifully red salmon, the smell was intoxicating. </p>
<p>Returning once more to the lower 48, I discovered ribs. All kinds of those luscious bits of bone-in pleasure: spare ribs, country ribs, baby back ribs. I have loved them all: the dry rubbed and smoked with sauces served on the side, to the sticky, drippy, tear the meat from the bone ribs.</p>
<p>With my heart and stomach here in Milwaukee it’s time to start a new smoked tradition. I want to share the tastes that I have been collecting.<span>  But I am without a<br/>crucial element in my plan. A smoker! Here is where our partnership begins. This<br/>campaign will help me accomplish that. Your contribution will enable me to not<br/>only make hams, bacon and whole hogs; it will also help me to cater parties.<br/>Parties like:</span></p>
<p>Dia de Los Puercos!</p>
<p><br/><b>We will buy a smoker, and you will get a party</b></p>
<p>Donors will be invited to Dia de Los Puercos. To be hosted by the Milwaukee Brewery!! A party I will throw in your honor. We will use the funds to purchase the smoker and the expenses of the party; including a whole hog, locally sourced and organic of course.</p>
<p>Top donors will be given the flavorful and rare cheeks, the succulent tenderloin and the crisp ears. Other top donors can receive a whole slab of bacon. The top donor will receive my rare Christmas ham. A barrel brined and smoked ham! </p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, the money will be put toward the purchase of the smoker, and we will throw another party. We all still win!</p>

<h3><b>About Kane &amp; Couture</b></h3>
<p>Kane
&amp; Couture is a canine lifestyle brand that offers fashionable, functional
and affordable products that fit the needs of the modern day dog owner. As a
devoted dog owner herself, Amber Lee Forrester found that most of the dog
apparel and products on the market were plaid, plain or suburban; if they were
cute they weren’t functional, and if they were functional they weren’t cute!
Amber founded Kane &amp; Couture with the goal of offering fashion-loving dog
owners the products they need, in the colors and styles they like, at price
points they can afford. <i>“As an out
of the box thinker, I wanted to do something different; something that would
stand out. So, I joined my love for fashion and my love dogs and started an
urban-chic dog fashion line.”</i></p><p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/542592/files/20140429094949-CocoKC_BW.jpg?1398790189"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><i>Jennifer Williams and her dog, Gia in the City Mini Harness and Leash from the Imperial Pup Collection</i><br/><br/><p></p><p>At Kane &amp; Couture our

<h4><b>About Amber</b></h4>
<p>Having
all of her eggs in one basket has never been a problem for Amber; long aware
that her ambition would take her far beyond the confines of her native city of
Detroit, Michigan, she moved to New York in 2000 to attend Fordham University's
College of Business Administration.  Over the years, Amber worked in
Marketing, PR and Events capacities in radio at New York’s WBLS, with spirits companies
such as Pernod Ricard and Diageo and water company, FIJI Water. Since founding
Kane &amp; Couture, Amber has gotten married and given birth to a beautiful
baby girl; yet, she has never allowed her devotion to either her family or her
business slip, even attending the Macy’s Workshop for Minority and Women-Owned
Businesses in her ninth month of pregnancy! Amber has expertly juggled family
life with the pressures of establishing a new business. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/542712/files/20140429104643-photo.jpg?1398793603"" src="""" style=""""/></p><i>Amber in the December 2013 Ebony Magazine Macy's Workshop Ad</i><br/><p></p><p></p>
<p>Having
spent five years carefully building her company, Amber took a brave step
forward for Kane &amp; Couture and, in 2013, auditioned for ABC’s Shark Tank in
the hopes of finding an investor to help her to take the company to the next
level. Armed with her knowledge of the industry and a passion for her field,
Amber convinced Daymond John and Lori Greiner to move forward with Kane &amp;
Couture, on the condition that she meets certain goals.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/542745/files/20140429105735-tile13-16x9-ABC-SharkTank-jpg_183846.jpg?1398794255"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>While
the exposure brought about by Shark Tank has dramatically increased sales, both
online and in stores, we are still working towards our goals and we need your
help! Continuing to do business that is limited to mostly independent retailers
means that our production costs are higher, designs are more difficult for our
customers to find and more expensive to buy when you do find them! Help us to
grow and expand our business online and to bigger retail stores so that we can
do what we do best – offer fun and fly fashion at low prices and keep the style
in you and your doggy’s lifestyle!</p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>Make
a Difference!</h3>
<p>At Kane &amp; Couture, we
know there is more to animal welfare than fashion and we strive to support the
many worthwhile animal charities that exist throughout the US. We are committed
to supporting at least one charity per month, helping our furry friends by
donating products and funds to wonderful causes, including Pet Partners and the
Pit's Haven Rescue Center. The larger we grow, the more we can give back and
continue to forge strong, beneficial partnerships with animal charities and organizations
in order to advocate the wellbeing of the animals we adore.</p>
<p>With your help, Kane &amp;
Couture will not only maintain its dedication to fostering a fashionable,
functional and affordable lifestyle for modern and stylish dog lovers, but will
continue to broaden its horizons by designing new styles, building our team, innovating
fresh ideas and taking impressive and progressive strides towards positive
growth.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/542758/files/20140429110145-rescue_on_tee.jpg?1398794505"" src="""" style=""width: 296px; height: 296px;""/></p><i>Kane &amp; Couture Rescue T-Shirt</i><br/><p></p>

Doggy Fashion Lovers!
Are
you tired of shopping the big stores only to find boring items that suit
neither you nor your pet’s personalities and styles? Every dog needs a collar,
harness and leash…hey! Some needs sweaters, coats and dresses too! Help us
expand our urban-chic, unique designs online and into major retail stores so
you can get great doggy styles at affordable prices!Amber holding Kane in our Bubba Dog Collection Hunter Collar
About Kane & Couture
Kane
& Couture is a canine lifestyle brand that offers fashionable, functional
and affordable products that fit the needs of the modern day dog owner. As a
devoted dog owner herself, Amber Lee Forrester found that most of the dog
apparel and products on the market were plaid, plain or suburban; if they were
cute they weren’t functional, and if they were functional they weren’t cute!
Amber founded Kane & Couture with the goal of offering fashion-loving dog
owners the products they need, in the colors and styles they like, at price
points they can afford. “As an out
of the box thinker, I wanted to do something different; something that would
stand out. So, I joined my love for fashion and my love dogs and started an
urban-chic dog fashion line.”Jennifer Williams and her dog, Gia in the City Mini Harness and Leash from the Imperial Pup CollectionAt Kane & Couture our
fresh, unique approach to the canine lifestyle industry separates us from other
brands in the business. Dogs are no longer confined to our homes and backyards;
they are part of our families and we want to make sure that you and your
four-legged family member are living in style!

Kane in Kane & Couture Boyfriend Button Down ShirtKane & Couture’s wide
assortment of products ranges from simply chic to decadent across four brands.
Our selection has expanded over the years to offer not only collars, harnesses,
leashes, carriers, beds and apparel, but also pet-themed human products
including totes, mugs, phone cases and our Pet and People matching t-shirts!
From the value-driven, casual Bubba Dog and sporty Urban Hound Collections, to
the lavish yet affordable Imperial Pup line, there is something to suit every
pup’s style and budget. Our couture Signature line offers high quality collars,
leashes and carriers featuring Italian hardware and Swarovski crystals, made in
the US to support American industry.

About Amber
Having
all of her eggs in one basket has never been a problem for Amber; long aware
that her ambition would take her far beyond the confines of her native city of
Detroit, Michigan, she moved to New York in 2000 to attend Fordham University's
College of Business Administration.  Over the years, Amber worked in
Marketing, PR and Events capacities in radio at New York’s WBLS, with spirits companies
such as Pernod Ricard and Diageo and water company, FIJI Water. Since founding
Kane & Couture, Amber has gotten married and given birth to a beautiful
baby girl; yet, she has never allowed her devotion to either her family or her
business slip, even attending the Macy’s Workshop for Minority and Women-Owned
Businesses in her ninth month of pregnancy! Amber has expertly juggled family
life with the pressures of establishing a new business. Amber in the December 2013 Ebony Magazine Macy's Workshop Ad
Having
spent five years carefully building her company, Amber took a brave step
forward for Kane & Couture and, in 2013, auditioned for ABC’s Shark Tank in
the hopes of finding an investor to help her to take the company to the next
level. Armed with her knowledge of the industry and a passion for her field,
Amber convinced Daymond John and Lori Greiner to move forward with Kane &
Couture, on the condition that she meets certain goals.
While
the exposure brought about by Shark Tank has dramatically increased sales, both
online and in stores, we are still working towards our goals and we need your
help! Continuing to do business that is limited to mostly independent retailers
means that our production costs are higher, designs are more difficult for our
customers to find and more expensive to buy when you do find them! Help us to
grow and expand our business online and to bigger retail stores so that we can
do what we do best – offer fun and fly fashion at low prices and keep the style
in you and your doggy’s lifestyle!
Make
a Difference!
At Kane & Couture, we
know there is more to animal welfare than fashion and we strive to support the
many worthwhile animal charities that exist throughout the US. We are committed
to supporting at least one charity per month, helping our furry friends by
donating products and funds to wonderful causes, including Pet Partners and the
Pit's Haven Rescue Center. The larger we grow, the more we can give back and
continue to forge strong, beneficial partnerships with animal charities and organizations
in order to advocate the wellbeing of the animals we adore.
With your help, Kane &
Couture will not only maintain its dedication to fostering a fashionable,
functional and affordable lifestyle for modern and stylish dog lovers, but will
continue to broaden its horizons by designing new styles, building our team, innovating
fresh ideas and taking impressive and progressive strides towards positive
growth.Kane & Couture Rescue T-Shirt
Our
Campaign
Our goal is to raise $25,000
for the growth of our company. This funding will go towards product
development, production, improving customer service, office space to house our
busy team, implementing a digital marketing campaign and exhibiting our
products at upcoming tradeshows such as SuperZoo pet industry show and the
highly regarded New York Gift Show.
We are offering unique perks
to thank you for donations of all sizes. From dazzling collars and apparel, to
extravagant haute couture accessories and life long discounts, we want to make
you and your pup feel as special as we do when we receive your support! As
extra special memento, our perks also include custom portraits of your dog and
generous gift cards for kaneandcouture.com to ensure that your pup is posing

The motto of this center is to promote empowerment, learning, sharing and
freedom. It will provide refuge for healing from persecution trauma, welcome
and train vulnerable individuals, in order to participate to their
emancipation, especially LGBT from a Muslim background, with a priority for
those coming from Middle East and Africa, thrown out of their home and/or

</p><p>The
proposed activities of this <i>CALEM Rumi’s Isiphephelo</i>
are equally about elaborating and sharing an inclusive, progressive, and
democratic ethos of citizenship within African Muslim communities and
challenging the marginalization and physical victimization of Muslim LGBT
people, women, and HIV positive individuals through outreach, dialogue and
civic education. To name a few things: not talking about transphobia in
general, more particularly when transgender individuals from Muslim background
dies they are generally cursed by their community and family, and no place want
to welcome their partner and friends for a last farewell and rites. Not talking
about homophobic, misogynistic and anti-Semitic sermons of some imams, more
particularly when queer Muslims visit Islamic or cultural conservative and
exclusive Muslim centers, they often report to us they have been stigmatized
because they wear too flashy cloths, earrings or because they are too
effeminate, according to the Muslim communities’ heteronormative standards.</p>
<p><span>Our intention is also to provide a
bigger microphone to progressive Muslim voices through the media and in
community engagement. To accomplish these goals, the <i>CALEM Rumi’s Isiphephelo</i> will offer seminars, conferences, media
events, political commentary, and personal empowerment within a marginalized
sector of society that, should all the allies who do in fact share a common
oppressor – patriarchal Islam – come together, will be far stronger than they
knew possible and tip the balance of the dynamics of immigration and refugees
flow, religious and cultural difference within Islam, and even cultural and gender
diversity within Muslim communities. We need to accomplish these goals because
if we do nothing today, we could be assured that in twenty years we will have
the same problems with Muslim youth especially concerning anti-Semitism,
misogynistic behaviors, homophobic and transphobic attitudes, low self-esteem,
violence; and perhaps the situation will be even worse than it is today. </span></p>
<p>According
to our expertise, we do not believe that citizens from a Muslim background are
conservative per nature, nor are they progressive; the majority of them follow
what comes from scholars performing in cultural and Islamic centers,
organizations and mosques. Thus, we have to provide a louder voice and more
visible platform for the progressive scholars and committed citizens from a
Muslim background to extend their positive influence, and fight back the negative
influence of the most conservative amongst our communities. We will create both
a physical refuge for dozens of people to engage with per year, but this is also
a new center of thought.<span>  The <i>CALEM Rumi’s Isiphephelo</i> will be a first
in the region that can speak directly to the African and Middle Eastern Muslim
experience as well as the experience of Muslims in Diasporas.  The effects of the center – education,
empowerment of progressive leaders and imam-es, engagement of allies and
adversaries – reaches well beyond South Africa, to shift the conversation of
minorities in the Muslim context from one of oppressor-oppressed to one of
philosophically divergent bodies within Islam, discussing what building a new

<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3 style=""line-height: 24px; font-size: 15px;""><strong>Since we began in May 2011, we've grown faster than we could have imagined. Just two years after listing our first item on Etsy, our jewelry and lifestyle accessories are now stocked in over 30 incredible boutiques around the world, and have received national press and accolade. Eighty hour work weeks, innovative product design, creative marketing prowess and ingenuity have turned Son of a Sailor into a full-fledged business. Collaboration, an appreciation for fun and lightheartedness, and a holistic approach to employment are propelling that business forward. </strong></h3>
<h3 style=""line-height: 24px; font-size: 15px;""><strong>We've launched this Indiegogo campaign to raise funds that will allow us to attend our first wholesale tradeshow, POOL, in Las Vegas. We expect the resulting growth in wholesale to help us provide full-time employment for our existing production staff, allow us to begin offering benefits, and grow our business in a meaningful way. You can help by pledging and taking advantage of some exclusive Son of a Sailor designs!</strong></h3>
<h1 style=""padding: 30px 0 5px 0; margin-bottom: 0;""><strong>/// OUR STORY \\\</strong></h1>
<p style=""margin-top: 0; line-height: 18px;"">In essence, Son of a Sailor began the day that William and Jessica met. She was an Austin transplant living in San Francisco, and he was visiting the city to see his friend, her roommate. After spending a day doing art projects on the floor of her bedroom, a relationship began to form. William and Jessica spent 10 months dating long-distance before she decided to return to Austin. Upon her return, they began making jewelry together, and Son of a Sailor was born. Within the scope of a year, they bought a house, started a business and became engaged to be married...it was all a bit of a whirlwind!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/722/892/d38bdea9582549dc539cb861b2c7adf5_large.jpg?1373040635"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px;"">The response to the jewelry and the new line of accessories, Son of a Sailor Supply, has been overwhelming. The business has grown tremendously over two years, and William and Jessica have been met with ever-increasing demand for their products. With three production assistants working with them out of an East Austin studio, the growth doesn't seem to be waning. It is a pivotal time for Son of a Sailor, and we'd love for you to be a part of the excitement.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px;""><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px;""><strong><em>Check out the video above to get the full story of Son of a Sailor!</em></strong></p>
<h1 style=""padding: 30px 0 5px 0; margin-bottom: 0;""><strong>/// WHAT WE DO \\\</strong></h1>
<p style=""margin-top: 0; line-height: 18px;"">We began making jewelry in May 2010. Always inspired by natural materials with rich provenance, we both love adding bold color and geometric form to our pieces. We experiment with new techniques and unexpected combinations. Our first collection, now fondly referred to as our Classics, was received with great enthusiasm. We were some of the first jewelry designers to hand paint geometric brass elements, adding an exciting field of color to our metal jewelry. We have always embraced color and pattern, which became evident in a new way in our next collection, Polaris. We began employing beading techniques and hand-stamping to our metalworking, creating paint inlays that give a whole new dimension to our metal pieces. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/722/895/c191b90dc1739e8b05f905abc689dae4_large.jpg?1373040675"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px;"">We are constantly thinking of new items we'd like to make, and ways that we want to express our aesthetic. Launching Son of a Sailor Supply last November allowed us to have a home for all of the ideas that we have beyond the jewelry. Our love for color and form is now applied to men's accessories, like knives and shaving kits, which have been met with open arms by our customers! From USB drives to leather key fobs, Son of a Sailor Supply is a gift shop for both men and women.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px;"">Between both shops, we hope to provide items that make people happy. We strive to remain affordable and accessible, use the highest quality materials, apply the most skilled craftsmanship possible to each item we make, and have fun doing it. </p>
<h1 style=""padding: 30px 0 5px 0; margin-bottom: 0;""><strong>/// OUR GOALS \\\</strong></h1>
<p style=""margin-top: 0; line-height: 18px;"">We realized that we would need help if we were going to meet the increasing demand for our products. It was also clear to us from the beginning that we wanted to take a holistic approach to employment. This business was born out of a meaningful relationship between its founders, and it only makes sense that the people Son of a Sailor employs are valued beyond simply their skill and labor. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/722/896/1e7d9b9659c3f1cae68884381b636615_large.jpg?1373040706"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px;"">We want to provide full-time creative employment to the people we bring on. We want to provide access to health care. We want to make sure that working for a small creative business in Austin doesn't mean that our employees have to sacrifice some of the basic needs of todays society. This is not an easy task for small business owners these days.</p>
<p style=""line-height: 18px;"">As we bring on employees that are interested in growing with Son of a Sailor, if we are able to nourish their lives in the process, we feel that there are few bounds to what we can do as a company. We want to continue creating, bringing new ideas to fruition, and presenting the best products we can to our audience.</p>

<h1><strong>/// HOW WE'LL USE OUR FUNDS \\\</strong></h1>
<ul style=""line-height: 18px;"">
<li>Our primary goal with the funds that we hope to raise through this campaign is to pay for our attendance at POOL Tradeshow, a wholesale show that we hope will allow us to grow our wholesale business in a large way. The show is expensive, and is a big jump for a business of our size. We believe this is the right time, though, to present our brand to stores and boutiques around the world. We've grown our wholesale business organically, and are proud to be represented in some amazing establishments. But POOL promises to put Son of a Sailor in front of a much larger retail audience. The money raised will pay for our booth fee and travel expenses to attend the show in late August. The booth fee alone is $4,000, and with travel, lodging, and build-out, we anticipate that it will end up costing about $6,000. The remaining amount from the campaign will cover fees, taxes, and production of rewards.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With the business we hope to generate at POOL, we would like to employ our existing production assistants full-time, and bring on one or two more members to our team. We would love to see this happen in the next two to three months. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We would also like to begin providing a monthly health-care stipend for each employee so that they may have greater access to insurance by the end of this year.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The next big step for Son of a Sailor is to add more studio space. We began out of a back room in our home, and just recently graduated to a true studio space in an East Austin complex. Almost as soon as we got settled in, we realized that the demand that Supply was facing meant that we still needed the space at home, in addition to the new studio! We are busting at the seams, and if we are funded beyond our initial amount, we have plans to build out a new studio space for Son of a Sailor Supply. </li>
</ul>

Since we began in May 2011, we've grown faster than we could have imagined. Just two years after listing our first item on Etsy, our jewelry and lifestyle accessories are now stocked in over 30 incredible boutiques around the world, and have received national press and accolade. Eighty hour work weeks, innovative product design, creative marketing prowess and ingenuity have turned Son of a Sailor into a full-fledged business. Collaboration, an appreciation for fun and lightheartedness, and a holistic approach to employment are propelling that business forward. 
We've launched this Indiegogo campaign to raise funds that will allow us to attend our first wholesale tradeshow, POOL, in Las Vegas. We expect the resulting growth in wholesale to help us provide full-time employment for our existing production staff, allow us to begin offering benefits, and grow our business in a meaningful way. You can help by pledging and taking advantage of some exclusive Son of a Sailor designs!
/// OUR STORY \\\
In essence, Son of a Sailor began the day that William and Jessica met. She was an Austin transplant living in San Francisco, and he was visiting the city to see his friend, her roommate. After spending a day doing art projects on the floor of her bedroom, a relationship began to form. William and Jessica spent 10 months dating long-distance before she decided to return to Austin. Upon her return, they began making jewelry together, and Son of a Sailor was born. Within the scope of a year, they bought a house, started a business and became engaged to be married...it was all a bit of a whirlwind!

The response to the jewelry and the new line of accessories, Son of a Sailor Supply, has been overwhelming. The business has grown tremendously over two years, and William and Jessica have been met with ever-increasing demand for their products. With three production assistants working with them out of an East Austin studio, the growth doesn't seem to be waning. It is a pivotal time for Son of a Sailor, and we'd love for you to be a part of the excitement.

/// WHAT WE DO \\\
We began making jewelry in May 2010. Always inspired by natural materials with rich provenance, we both love adding bold color and geometric form to our pieces. We experiment with new techniques and unexpected combinations. Our first collection, now fondly referred to as our Classics, was received with great enthusiasm. We were some of the first jewelry designers to hand paint geometric brass elements, adding an exciting field of color to our metal jewelry. We have always embraced color and pattern, which became evident in a new way in our next collection, Polaris. We began employing beading techniques and hand-stamping to our metalworking, creating paint inlays that give a whole new dimension to our metal pieces. 

We are constantly thinking of new items we'd like to make, and ways that we want to express our aesthetic. Launching Son of a Sailor Supply last November allowed us to have a home for all of the ideas that we have beyond the jewelry. Our love for color and form is now applied to men's accessories, like knives and shaving kits, which have been met with open arms by our customers! From USB drives to leather key fobs, Son of a Sailor Supply is a gift shop for both men and women.
Between both shops, we hope to provide items that make people happy. We strive to remain affordable and accessible, use the highest quality materials, apply the most skilled craftsmanship possible to each item we make, and have fun doing it. 
/// OUR GOALS \\\
We realized that we would need help if we were going to meet the increasing demand for our products. It was also clear to us from the beginning that we wanted to take a holistic approach to employment. This business was born out of a meaningful relationship between its founders, and it only makes sense that the people Son of a Sailor employs are valued beyond simply their skill and labor. 

We want to provide full-time creative employment to the people we bring on. We want to provide access to health care. We want to make sure that working for a small creative business in Austin doesn't mean that our employees have to sacrifice some of the basic needs of todays society. This is not an easy task for small business owners these days.
As we bring on employees that are interested in growing with Son of a Sailor, if we are able to nourish their lives in the process, we feel that there are few bounds to what we can do as a company. We want to continue creating, bringing new ideas to fruition, and presenting the best products we can to our audience.

/// HOW WE'LL USE OUR FUNDS \\\

Our primary goal with the funds that we hope to raise through this campaign is to pay for our attendance at POOL Tradeshow, a wholesale show that we hope will allow us to grow our wholesale business in a large way. The show is expensive, and is a big jump for a business of our size. We believe this is the right time, though, to present our brand to stores and boutiques around the world. We've grown our wholesale business organically, and are proud to be represented in some amazing establishments. But POOL promises to put Son of a Sailor in front of a much larger retail audience. The money raised will pay for our booth fee and travel expenses to attend the show in late August. The booth fee alone is $4,000, and with travel, lodging, and build-out, we anticipate that it will end up costing about $6,000. The remaining amount from the campaign will cover fees, taxes, and production of rewards.


With the business we hope to generate at POOL, we would like to employ our existing production assistants full-time, and bring on one or two more members to our team. We would love to see this happen in the next two to three months. 


We would also like to begin providing a monthly health-care stipend for each employee so that they may have greater access to insurance by the end of this year.


The next big step for Son of a Sailor is to add more studio space. We began out of a back room in our home, and just recently graduated to a true studio space in an East Austin complex. Almost as soon as we got settled in, we realized that the demand that Supply was facing meant that we still needed the space at home, in addition to the new studio! We are busting at the seams, and if we are funded beyond our initial amount, we have plans to build out a new studio space for Son of a Sailor Supply.

/// THANKS! \\\
We would be remiss not to thank a number of people that have helped us with this Indiegogo campaign!
We were so lucky to be able to work with Fine Blend Media in the creation of our video. Chad and Ricardo were such a joy to work with, and created a work of art that far exceeded our expectations.
Our great friend David Hawkins is the man behind the smile-inducing music that's playing in the video. We're so excited that he was able to compose the perfect piece of music for us!
Sumeera Rasul and the folks at Madesmith have been invaluable to us throughout this process. Not only did they write one of the most beautiful pieces about Son of a Sailor that's ever been written, they've helped us as we navigate the challenges of a fast-growing business.
Kirsten, Caitlin, and Kelsey have been such amazing additions to the Son of a Sailor team. Their commitment and dedication to their jobs makes it easy to want to see them succeed with us! We love that you ladies are at once willing to work so hard and laugh so much with us---thanks!
And lastly, here's to all of you who want to join us in this exciting endeavor. We hope that the exclusively designed pieces we've created and the promise of helping a small business succeed are motivation enough for you to help us reach our goal!",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our team is ready to get to work as soon as possible. As for the tiny home itself, it is currently being built off site and will be delivered to our property once completed (Mid-May 2018).

<h3>The Purpose</h3>
<p><font size=""3""><font color=""#000000"">The purpose of this campaign is to raise some fun. This is not a campaign to raise money for a much needed cause, the next can't live without invention or album that will hit the top charts. There isn't a return on investment on this campaign or promised prizes for those that contribute. I am honestly not expecting many to take part but I thought it might be fun and maybe if a bunch of people contributed $10.00 I would be on my way to getting her done. When I was about 16 years old had the opportunity to work on two project cars for our auto shop class. That experience introduced me to the world of classic cars. Two things I didn't have back then were money and patience. You really need both when working on classic cars. Fast forward almost 20 years and I find myself getting a 1954 Chevy 3100 Pick-up Truck. The amazing thing is that the truck was a gift from an old friend. I was blown away by the generosity of this friend and was excited for the possibility of having a classic car once again. This time around I had one of the two things needed when working on classic cars, patience. The truck needed a new engine so it sat for about two 1/2 years before I was able to give it any attention. My wife even tried getting it on this show where they steal your classic car and finish it in 7 days. Well they told her to send in all the information and then the show went off the air. The truck so far has had a new engine and transmission put in. I was also able to get an old front and rear end from a 70’s Camaro which has been installed under the truck. To get to this place has been a little over 4 years. There is finally some light at the end of the tunnel! However, I am fully aware that this is a toy and as the Bible says, something that moth and rust can destroy. It is something to have fun in and maybe take to show and have the opportunity to meet some new people and maybe be able to share Jesus with them. </font></font></p><p></p><p></p>

According to the Digital Brain Health Market Report, published by Sharp Brains 2013 ( www.sharpbrains.com/market-report), “2 billion people worldwide suffer from brain-based health and productivity challenges.  In 2015, the resulting global economic burden is estimated at over 2 trillion dollars.  Public Health initiatives aim to achieve lasting public health and wellness changes, specifically the promotion of improved and better regulated cognitive function.  Healthy aging programs promote “a nation in which the public embraces cognitive health as a vital component of health.”  The Public Health Road Map for State and National Partnerships, 2013 through 2018, lays out a spectrum of broad actions designed to promote brain functioning.  The US Government Healthy Brain Initiative Action items include the need to monitor and evaluate, educate and empower…”                       According to Brain Health Market Report, people want self-administered, non-invasive, preventive options and more wellness and fitness than medicine. The survey of over 3,000 early adopters and decision makers found these interesting statistics: 73% agree that digital technologies can significantly complement other behavioral and drug-based interventions,94% agree that addressing brain health should be a wellness priority,83% agree that adults should take charge of their own brain fitness without waiting for a doctor to tell them,With Indiegogo global networks, we intend to spread the message about the availability of affordable brain health tools that people are asking for.We've set a goal of $250,000.00, which will allow us to integrate (wireless) bluetooth technology into the existing HEG biosensor headband and integrate the encoder.  Every dollar raised through Indiegogo will go directly to headband redesign and toward the development of immersive software for your smartphone or tablet.  We can begin our first large scale manufacturing and make Gold Mind Brain Gym™ available as soon as December 2014.Future Plans Imagine playing your favorite video games hands free.

Well, I have a funny though unfortunate story to share.<br/><br/>Yesterday, March 1st, 2014, I was minding my own business driving to the pharmacy for my heart medication, then off to my sister's to visit with her dog as my sister worked her typical 12 hour Saturday shift at the hospital. <br/>On my way through my hometown of Ocean City, NJ, I was pulled over by a cop. This is the 4th time in the last 12 months I have been pulled over in my home town of a mere 11,000 residents stretching a whopping 8 miles on our little island. (Prior 3 resulted in no tickets, because I was doing NOTHING wrong.) This time was not so innocuous.<br/><br/>The officer came to my window and as he asked for my papers I asked why he pulled me over. His response was that my registration was expired. I immediately disagreed and asked why he thought so. He said he ran my tags and the computer shows it as expired. (At this point I will confirm it WAS, in fact, expired. Last winter I went through plenty of personal turmoil, lo-lighted by losing my car amidst some $30-40,000 in damages to 'Super Storm Sandy', followed a month later by the loss of my mother to cancer. My prior car registration ran through May 1st each year, but I ended up taking possession of Mom's car after the new year and apparently officially registered it at the end of January. Thus my confusion.)<br/>When I gave him my papers and he confirmed my mistake, I asked why he ran my tags. He said ""Because I can."" He then went to his cruiser and wrote me a ticket for the expired registration. Upon his return, as he was handing me the ticket, I again asked why he ran my tags, and what I had done wrong to cause any suspicion. He answered that he didn't need a suspicion and just ran the tags because I was in front of him.<br/>I asked him if he was aware of the protections of the 4th Amendment at which time he told me I had a bad attitude and if I didn't 'fix it' he was going to impound my car. I said ""So you are now going to antagonize and intimidate me with the threat of towing on top of the ticket?"" His response was ""That's it, I'm towing your car."" and he walked away.<br/>Before the two truck arrived, he OF COURSE, had a back up officer roll up. When that officer approached me I ask by what authority the first pulled me over and by what authority were they now taking my property. His response was priceless! ...<br/>He said ""The 5th Amendment gives us the authority.""!!! I know, I know! I laughed right in his face! <br/>After explaining the 5th Amendment's ACTUAL meaning and how they were infringing on my 5th A protected right by improper seizure of personal property, I also explained the 4th A and my right to privacy making the running of tags improper, then explained the purpose of the Bill of Rights was to protect ME from THEM and gave them NO authority to do ANYTHING. Then for good measure I cited the Supremacy Clause as rebuttal to their failed effort to argue they had some statutory right to usurp my 4th and 5th A Rights. After they conferred and realized they were outgunned , they told me to stop arguing because ""We can go 'round and 'round here on the side of the road and never get any answers."" To wit I offered to get my pocket copy of THE CONSTITUTION out of my briefcase. They declined and proceeded to steal, er eh, I'm sorry, ""impound"" my personal property.<br/>I write this to share this experience so others see how deeply screwed up our dear Republic has become and to ask for help.<br/>I have spent the better part of the last three years developing my own business for marketing nightlife and while it is slowly getting closer to a profitable launch, it does not currently generate any revenue. Though I have very recently dived into another opportunity to create income, I am still barely living hand to mouth at this point.<br/>When I total up the ticket, towing fee, impound lot charge and daily storage charges, I face a financial burden I simply cannot take on at this point in time. I honestly do not have exact totals yet because it is the weekend, but I wanted to get this story out and start this campaign asap as every day counts! <br/>My target goal to raise is just $600.00. My hope is that I can beg or borrow enough from family to get my car out by week's end so storage charges do not become completely untenable, but family is no better off than I am so I will NEED to repay them quickly.<br/>I ask that you donate even a few bucks to my cause because I really need the help, but perhaps more importantly, I ask that you SHARE this campaign where ever you interact with Liberty Seekers. Obviously further exposure of the campaign will increase my chances of raising the funds, but it will also spread the word of the continuing usurpation of our Rights.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello! My name is Felisha. I'm a young registered nurse living in sunny South Florida! </p>
<p>Arianne's Senior Social Club is an adult daycare inspired by Arianne, herself! (Also known as my grandmother). This business was initiated to reduce the lack of socialization, and increase the longevity of life of our elderly people. Here in the northern parts of South Florida, we have a slew of older, retired adults who, unfortunately, do not have much to occupy their time. Our family who have worked so hard during their lifetime to care for us are now home alone or awaiting their loved ones to return home from their day. During this time alone, there's an increase of depression, anxiety, the risk of falls, other injuries, and sometimes even death with out the proper care and supervision. Arianne's Senior Social Club is devised to decrease these risk factors by creating a space to be active and content throughout the day. While we go to work, school, and complete other tasks, our loved ones are in a safe environment providing conversations, games, activities, exercise, nutrition, transportation, and medical supervision. Our staff is equipped with healthcare professionals who have the skill and knowledge to both supervise and interact with all of our participants throughout the day. Not only does this benefit our loved ones, but it also gives the caregiver a chance to take a small break, so that they're able to love and care for their family adequately. Supporting this campaign will launch this business and ensure that our families who worked so hard during their time to take care of us are taken care of just the same, if not better!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently, we are in need of $20,000. This funding will cover the building to hold our participants, as well as furniture, decor, and the respective amenities to be able to provide to the fullest capacity. </li>
<li>When fully funded, we can begin to work on our next project.. A POOL! A handicap and wheelchair accessible pool will open up the opportunity for water aerobics as a form of exercise in our facility. </li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, the funds will mainly go towards funding the building as a foundation for our plans.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Arianne's Senior Social Club aims to provide a sense of togetherness and love within the elderly community. Our facility provides an outlet where seniors can interact with their peers and like-minded individuals all while improving their well-being. Our top three assets that differentiates us from other adult daycares are companionship, promoting healthy living, and our very own Benefits Assistance Program. These include, interactive activities, proper diets, exercise, mental health, computer literacy, and so much more.  The Benefits Assistance Program aids our seniors who may need help with eligibility and the application processes of things such as Medicare, Medicaid, SNAPS, citizenship, etc. Arianne's Senior Social Club is curated to bring fun, creativity, life longevity, new experiences, and education for our loved ones. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have been a nurse for over six years. The bulk of my career has been in a long-term care facility. Therefore, I have a lot of experience with this particular population. The elderly, those suffering from dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and decreased mobility are no things new to me and our staff. The biggest risk is that this is my first time opening and managing a facility on my own. However, I'm taking this risk full on with positive and faith-filled mindset. Knowing that this plan has been placed on my heart by the Lord Himself and it's my duty to fulfill it with hard-work, dedication, and keeping Him first! </p>

(LGMF).                                                                               Our goal is educating and encouraging people to get involved in finding solutions to problems, rather than leaning on big government to solve our problems.

My name is Buddy Belk. I'm a 'less government' crusader and love this country 

Spreading the LGMF message will ultimately unite Americans. It's simple: you are either for less government and more fun. Or, you're not
Contributors will help to provide the resources needed to help spread our message to each of the 50 states.   
What We Need & What You GetWe are seeking $25,000 in funding.
The funding will provide materials and perks for at least one college ambassador in each state. (Goal is to connect with multiple schools in each state)
Our message is distinctive, yet simple. The words (LGMF) strike passion in the heart of all who believe a smaller government is the right kind of government
If our goal is not met, the funding we do receive will be used to seek out LGMF ambassadors in as many states as the funds will allow
The ImpactWhen tens of thousands of Americans get behind a great idea, amazing things happen: The message spreads and passion takes over.
Energizing college students to become more self reliant instead of waiting for big government to solve problems will be critical for success
It's a major mind shift from what the media and millions of people say and believe today
College-aged Americans will evangelize the message through action and education at their schools and in their communities
Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are not able to provide financial support you can help in other ways:
Tell family and friends about LGMF and encourage them to make some noise 
Write down on paper: ""Less Government. More Fun."" and let us know what they mean to you via Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest or at lessgovmorefun.com

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>    My name is Ahmad Masoor Simmons.  This is my second time trying to do this. I haven't had much success with indiegogo. However, I am not a quiter so I am trying again. </p>
<p>   It has been little over a full year since I have seen my children. I have two boys who after a seperation were taken back to the states. I remained in Brazil to chase the dream of trying to build a reality of culture and a natural lifestyle for my children. Unfrotunately it has taken a very long time to get it going.  And even though it is picking up momentum now I can not bare the pain of being away from my children any longer.  </p>
<p>  How I got to this point?  I made a decision a long time ago after having lived in the US that I would dedicate my life to helping people especially children around the world.  I started here in Brazil with an unregistered non-profit charity called Guerreiros da Luz. For thirten years I planned and thaught of how to make this thing work. For 3 years I had it running.  I have help a number of kids through many tough situatons.  However, my original plans included my children. after a rough split with my ex-wife I lost my kids and they were taken back to the states.  Now after a year of not see them I am beyond the point of reason.  I am desperately asking for help and doing all things possible to get back to them.  I am working, but between paying rent and eating I am not able to save enough to ensure that I will be able to travel.  </p>
<p>    I am not asking for alot from any one individual.  If you all can help with a little it will end up being enough.  I am able to save up a little bit of money so I will be able to make up the difference if I do not get all I need from here. Or, if someone has a way to get a discounted flight that would also help. </p>
<p>    There are no special perks this time because I have nothing to give. I can only offer my gratitude to you for helping me. And I believe that when I am ale to hold my kids in my arms they will be thankful that you helped as well. Please if you can help, me do so.  I also understand that things are hard all over the place so if you are strapped and can not help at all I understand.  Please at least pray for this to happen and send up positive energy for me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I greatly appreciate your time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p> Dear Friend,</p>
<p>When Tea Party Nation first started, we had a simple
idea.  We wanted to create a organization
that would be entirely funded by advertising revenue.  I hoped that by funding it that way, it would free up your
money to spend on candidates.</p>
<p>Things don’t always work out the way we want them to and we
have never been able to generate the revenues we needed or wanted for our
activism.</p>
<p>Because of this, I am pleased to announce the creation of
Tea Party Nation Action, our new non-profit arm.</p>
<p>Why Tea Party Nation Action?</p>
<p>We learned when we did the First National Tea Party
Convention that there was a huge need within our movement to bring activists
together.  There was and still is
much we need to learn about how to be effective activists. There is even more
we need to do. </p>
<p>Over the next few months, Tea Party Nation Action will be
announcing a series of events that will help to bring conservative activists
together in ways we have not been brought together in the past.  We will also work to help train and
organize conservatives so we can be as effective as the liberals have been in
the past..</p>
<p>There is a reason we always say we do more with less than
any other Tea Party Group out there. 
We have run Tea Party Nation for the last four years on a shoestring
budget, and yet managed to accomplish many of our objectives.</p>
<p>The Tea Party movement is incredible because it has changed
the course of American politics. 
Unfortunately, while we have become a force to be reckoned with, we have
not been nearly as successful as we need to be.  That is why we are creating Tea Party Nation Action.</p>
<p>We need your help in funding our new non-profit and getting
it off the ground.  Today we need
your generous contribution of $25, $50, $100, $250 or more to help us.</p>
<p>2014 can be like 2010 again.  We must make that happen.  Tea Party Nation Action is a group that is going to help
make that happen.</p>
<p>In order for us to launch Tea Party Nation Action, we need
to raise $10,000 by September 6<sup>th</sup>.  Help us turn the tide for America!</p>
<p>Please join us!</p>
<p>In Liberty,</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>GMO Labeling Massachusetts is a  group of dedicated citizens working to defend our right to know what is in our food. Our strategy and our goal is the same; democracy. We will use the ballot initiative process to make GMO labeling required by law for all food sold in MA. We will use your support to set the exciting precedent of crowd funding legislative efforts that protect and inform everyone. Although this campaign is currently Massachusetts focused, a victory here will have dramatic affects on the national ""right to know"" movement. </p>
<p>All funds raised will be used to collect the 70,000 signatures required to ensure our place on the ballot.</p>
<p>Genetically  Modified Organisms (GMOs) are plants or animals created through the process of genetic engineering. This experimental technology forces DNA  from one species into a different species. The resulting GMOs are unstable combinations of plant, animal, bacterial and viral genes that would not occur in nature and have unknown long term health consequences. According to the Grocery Manufactures Association, nearly 80% of processed foods contain GMOs.</p>
<p>We believe GMO's need to be labeled because:</p>
<p>1. We have the right to know what is in our food. Period.</p>
<p>2. There have been no long term studies on the health effects of GMOs. Until we label GMOs, true independent research will be nearly impossible. Labeling will enable us to exercise our right to make precautionary choices.</p>
<p>3. GMOs spread uncontrollably and threaten sustainable agriculture practices.</p>
<p>4. GMOs are used to enable crops to be saturated in chemical herbicides that inhibit nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>5. GMOs could possibly be related to the recent explosion in food allergies and other public health concerns. Only labeling will enable researchers to definitively inform the public about GMO effects on environmental and public health.</p>
<p>6. Nearly 50 countries require labels on GMOs, and many also have severe restrictions of bans against GMO food production or sale. We deserve the same level of protection and information as citizens in other nations.</p>
<p>Your support will be the difference in protecting our food supply.  Contributions will help our grassroots campaign send a powerful message to the biotechnology industry, one of the most politically influential industry's in the world. Through a successful ballot initiative, we will not only unify a resounding democratic voice that will be heard across the country, but we will also achieve a victory that will make labeling in other states and even nationally  nearly inevitable. For example, Connecticut has already passed a GMO labeling law that will only go into effect when a neighboring state also passes a GMO labeling law.</p>
<p>Massachusetts is an ideal state for this effort. The state is small enough for a grass roots effort to really grab hold, the people are well informed and open to new ideas, and the organic food movement is well established. </p>
<p>If you would like to learn more about GMOs a great movie to look into is Genetic Roulette, available on youtube. A great website to visit is <a href=""http://justlabelit.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://justlabelit.org/</a></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funds to hire volunteer coordinators and signature gatherers to ensure that we get the required 70,000 signatures required by the December 4 deadline. All additional funds raised will go towards the infrastructure of a successful campaign including:</p>
<p>Voter education, outreach, and strategic advertising</p>
<p>Administrative staff to coordinate the campaign</p>
<p>Legal, financial, media and political consulting as needed</p>
<p>Logistical expenses</p>
<p>What you get? Legislative experience! (and with it, the enormous satisfaction of participating in our democracy through more than your vote.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Currently, 37 states are pursuing mandatory labeling legislation. Even if you don't live in Massachusetts, please consider the national impact of a victory here. Not only will other state's labeling campaigns be significantly emboldened, and there existing laws enabled, but there are several financial, logistical and legal reasons to expect that national food processors will soon change all of their packaging even if only one state requires it. </p>
<p>We welcome the debate with folks who believe GMOs are safe and/or beneficial. But we believe labeling is beyond debate. Labeling isn't a ban on these foods, it is simply a protection of our freedom to choose.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you would like to contribute in ways other than through a donation think about these ideas:</p>
<p>1. Spread the word to your network to support this indiegogo campaign</p>
<p>2. If you live in, near or are visiting Massachusetts, consider volunteering to collect signatures or do voter education.</p>
<p>3. Post any news about the campaign to your social media network</p>
<p>4. Inform yourself on the subject</p>
<p>5. Boycott GMOs. Because they are not labeled, the only way to boycott GMOs is to buy from companies who voluntarily label their products as non-GMO or to by USDA organic certified foods.</p>For more information or to volunteer visit: at <a href=""http://gmolabelmass.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://gmolabelmass.org/</a> and be sure to like us on facebook and spread the word at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/gmolabelMA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/gmolabelMA</a><p><br/></p>

<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Things Liz Makes wants to expand their offerings!</span></h2>
<p>Things Liz Makes is a Utah-based small business that is run by work at home mom Liz Beckwith. I've been a professional fiber artist for over 2 years now, and providing a high quality, well-made product has been my priority from day one.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">I currently specialize in spinning fibers, handspun and hand dyed yarns, but I can make a whole lot more than that! I want to open two new lines within the established Things Liz Makes brand. The first line, TLM Bags, will be comprised of project bags that are marketed directly to spinners and are unique, functional, durable and attractive. The second line, TLM Baby, will have lots of cute and functional handmade baby gear that is made with natural parenting in mind. Some items that will be available include cloth diapering accessories, hand knit soakers, teething pads for baby wearing wraps and more.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In order to supply the best possible product, I need to start with the best quality materials. For the bags line, this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>High quality fabrics that will hold up to wear and tear</li>
<li>Top quality threads and structure pieces</li>
<li>A new sewing machine that can handle a high volume of projects</li>
</ul>
<p>For the baby line, this means great fabrics that are made using environmentally friendly processes and natural fibers, but that can also hold up to the heavy use they will get from baby. For contributing to the cause, you will be among the first people to get your hands on these awesome products!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The ideas that sparked this campaign were based on a need that I was unable to find an existing answer to.</h2>
<p>I'm a spinner, and I have not been able to find a project bag that was functional and could protect my spindle. After all, spindles get expensive! This need sparked a brainstorming session in which I designed a bag that will be fashionable and functional for the spindle spinner. This bag will have a structured build that will prevent damage to the user's spindle, as well as a roomy fiber compartment and a zip pocket for notions.</p>
<p>Another need that I've experienced lately is a need for natural parenting accessories. My third child was born in March, and I've been exploring natural parenting options like cloth diapering and baby wearing. There are loads of shops that create great baby goodies, but there are things that I just haven't been able to find. One item that sparked my interest in creating natural parenting accessories was teething pads. So far, they are only available for soft structured carriers and not for woven wraps or slings. While the fabrics used to make these carriers are not damaged by baby drool, in my experience they tend to wick moisture onto the wearer's clothes, which is kind of unpleasant! I've worked up a design for a teething pad that absorbs baby drool, prevents it from transferring to the wrap or your clothes, and is removable even while you're wearing baby.</p>
<p>These ideas sparked more ideas, and I've been working furiously to make all these great things I have in my head. I need your help to share these things with the world!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE!</strong> I have been workign furiously on getting the spindler's project bag idea just right, and I think I've worked out the final version of the bag! It's in production as we speak, and I will continue posting pictures in the update tab. Be sure to check the update tab for more information on where the project is!</p>

I coauthored an article about this with Australian academic Terry Leahy who has been conducting research on food security projects in Africa since 2003 and regards the Chikukwa project as the most successful he has encountered and the best model he has seen that would likely succeed in  other parts of Africa.
Last year  we raised $2000 for a pilot “train the trainer” programme  to prepare the Chikukwa community to host a group of about  20 farmers from elsewhere in Zimbabwe. Following the successful conclusion of this training  we asked them  to prepare us a proposal  and budget and are now raising $13,000 so that farmers from the poor community of Murehwa can travel to Chikukwa and be housed, fed and trained for 2 weeks in the permaculture skills that have allowed Chikukwa to thrive.
I’ll start the ball rolling with a $3000 donation and am setting up two crowdfunding sites, this one to try and raise $7000 on indiegogo (with tax deductibility for US$ donations through our longtime US partners the Earthways Foundation) and another to try and raise $3000 on www.gofundme.com/3wckl0 that will do the same for Aussie donations.
Please make a contribution if you can and also let people know by sharing this campaign via indiegogo’s share tools.

<h3>Stupid for Smarts</h3>
<p>Hi. I'm Wallace. And I've been inspired to get off my butt and do something to help. And the people of Haiti need help. My girlfriend, Kathryn Ward, is an official representative of a ministry in Mole Saint Nicolas, Haiti.

You donate $10. You get to decide whatever terribly embarassing, weird, or whatever photo I take. If its within the law and common human decency, I'll do it. I do something stupid for your money and the children of Haiti can get an education. Stupid for Smarts. Get it now? :D </p>

<li>You leave your picture request in the donation. It can be anything. Want me to dress up like a woman? Good. I have great legs. Want me to dress up like Hulk Hogan and play basketball?

I met Cate when she was in Paris and straight away understood how great she was, since then we have become really close friends.</span><br/><span></span></p><p><span>
As you all know Cate has been through a lot lately,
for those who don't know Cate has had a series of 6 surgeries since last 
Spring to deal with health issues, culminating in her recent double mastectomy weeks ago for breast cancer, that her insurance company wasn't 
covering. She still has months of procedures ahead including another major surgery already in Feb, plus all the pain and hassles that go with 
body-part reconstruction after essentially amputating. And now her insurance has just switched her policy to a really bad one because she fought them all last year and wrote a bill for new healthcare legislation for women that now is with the Senate in California so other women would not go through what she has had to. But what Cate gets from this effort is that in 2014 they are calling her ""non-compliant"", making her pay twice as much for almost no coverage and her doctors are all dropping network care anyway. American healthcare is in critical trouble as we all know but for some one like Cate who is caught in a horrible situation in the middle of this bad time in the US, it is really important to be able to keep going while the govt and congress work through their issues. Many people can wait it out but Cate can't. We need her healthy and in one piece as fast as possible so she can get back to normal life, back to work on her business which was growing before this all hit, and back to being the strong advocate she is for women's health and breast cancer.<br/></span></p><p><span>She had to sell her house to finance part of this and was also helped by
 some family. but unfortunately this is still not enough as she still 
miss money for the last months of her operations, and can't work at the 
moment (and hasn't been able to for months) following a freak car 
accident that was not even her fault in the middle of all this- and also
 has its own set of expenses and issues.

Also Cate hates to ask for help. <br/></span></p><p><span>But having seen my Uncle move in 
America and need collective help to pay for his American surgery as it 
is not covered the way it is in France or UK, I thought it would be a 
good idea to collect some money to help Cate pay for her last operations
 and for her to have a decent life during these tough times when she 
really can't do anything she could normally. 

I don't want to share this on social networks as I know Cate would not 
like it (so please don't post anywhere public!) But I hoped by maybe 
doing this back-channel we could help her keep going through this 
incredibly bad time with continued push-back and frustrations from her 
insurance company.</span></p><p><span>  If you can donate and/ or help spread this with 
direct messages or email that would be great. Considering she already 
sold her house I doubt we can raise enough to cover everything, but 
anything we can do to help her cover some expenses would be helping a 
lot already. I don't want to embarrass Cate with this but I also do not want to sit by passively and watch everything she has worked for continue to fall away because of a really broken system she was born under and is trying to change.</span></p><p>Just so you know I contacted Cate for her paypal account and all money will go straight to her paypal, you can obviously ask her, as you don't know me and I wouldnt myself give any money to someone I don't know. <br/></p><p>Thanks in advance for helping me spread the word, this is really important for Cate, and even if you can't donate a lot, don't hesitate to participate even a bit. <br/></p><p><br/></p></div>","Hi everyone,For those of you who don't know me, I'm a friend of Cate.

</p><h2>What is TweakStyle?</h2>
<p>TweakStyle is an upcoming code editor for web designers and web developers, focused on frontend development.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/417648/files/20140307081938-tag-cloud.png?1394209178"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p>
<p>
</p><h2>Why TweakStyle?</h2>
<p>Today, the usual	web design workflow is heavility split. We use dozen of tools that do not interact. We lose a lot of time, switching between windows, searching for what
	we want to change and using inadequate tools. Most code editors and IDEs are made for coding and for coding only, but web design is much more than just	coding. Web design is about combining, adjusting, testing. </p>
<p>As a result TweakStyle breaks with standard code editors and introduces some unique features thought for web design packed with an unmatched user-friendly interface.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2>What are our guidelines?</h2>
<p>We’re building a software to be used intensively everyday by demanding people. Usefulness, quality and user experience are permanent concerns. We want to break
	with all those fusty tools and bring UX, usability, ergonomic design, intuitiveness and ease of use in code editors. Features should be accessible when we need it, at the right place and in an intuitive way.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/417922/files/20140307100614-guidelines.png?1394215574"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h2>Features</h2>
<p>The video above presents only a few of the features TweakStyle offers and there are a lot more coming.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here’s an <b>extract</b> of features currently being developed</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/417652/files/20140307082246-coreFeatures.png?1394209366"" src="""" style=""""/><p> </p>

<p>
</p><h2>Why a crowdfunding campaign?</h2>
<p>We have a lot of ideas and our feature pipe is growing each day, but we lack the resources to develop them. At our current development rate, We’re confident in being able
	to deliver the Core of TweakStyle by the end of the year but the Core is only the start of what we want to achieve.</p>

	The crowdfunding campaign have now reached its deadline.Thanks to all of you, we have raised more than $8000.We're extremely grateful for that and we're going to do everything in our power to deliver the very best product for you all.




What is TweakStyle?
TweakStyle is an upcoming code editor for web designers and web developers, focused on frontend development.


Why TweakStyle?
Today, the usual	web design workflow is heavility split. We use dozen of tools that do not interact. We lose a lot of time, switching between windows, searching for what
	we want to change and using inadequate tools. Most code editors and IDEs are made for coding and for coding only, but web design is much more than just	coding. Web design is about combining, adjusting, testing. 
As a result TweakStyle breaks with standard code editors and introduces some unique features thought for web design packed with an unmatched user-friendly interface.


What are our guidelines?
We’re building a software to be used intensively everyday by demanding people. Usefulness, quality and user experience are permanent concerns. We want to break
	with all those fusty tools and bring UX, usability, ergonomic design, intuitiveness and ease of use in code editors. Features should be accessible when we need it, at the right place and in an intuitive way.



Features
The video above presents only a few of the features TweakStyle offers and there are a lot more coming.
 
Here’s an extract of features currently being developed
 
And an extract of the ideas we have for the future


Why a crowdfunding campaign?
We have a lot of ideas and our feature pipe is growing each day, but we lack the resources to develop them. At our current development rate, We’re confident in being able
	to deliver the Core of TweakStyle by the end of the year but the Core is only the start of what we want to achieve.
We’ve created a crowdfunding campaign because we would like to deliver more, sooner and more surely.
The more funds we’ll raise the sooner TweakStyle will reach its full potential.


The best part: your perks

This allows an earlier profit to be achieved while employing more people. These profits will be shared in a cooperative style through discounts being made available to those neighbors who contribute food waste and time. Some of the profits will also be directed towards neighborhood improvement projects such as shade trees to make the neighborhood more walkable. The bottom line is this solution builds on itself through one investment as a continuous flow of free food waste equals more capital for urban farming. These urban farms then serve as sources for neighborhood development in economic, social, and environmental wellbeing.</p>
<p>The urban farms that NeighborCulture constructs and manages will not only be low cost, but also have a low footprint. Bringing decades of combined experience in earth-friendly agriculture techniques such as permaculture, the urban farms will require minimal inputs and maintenance. The transport used for diverting food waste will be bike carts; reducing the need for fossil fuel and cutting contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. The pilot program will take place in the Mitchell Park neighborhood in Tempe just west of Mill Ave; a neighborhood that is home to a community garden that cannot meet demand and many enthusiastic neighbors that I've worked closely with. Being so close to ASU's Tempe Campus will give NeighborCulture visibility and a good source of help from students concerned with food system sustainability and hungering for real world experience.</p>
<p>NeighborCulture measures its success in how quickly a neighborhood can take ownership for and manage its neighborhood's urban farm program. It will provide educational training opportunities to further this end and foster innovation among neighborhood residents. We already have land and labor available.  We just need your help to get a good boost to expand operations.  If you cannot donate money please send us any information and resources that you believe can help.</p></div>","NeighborCulture seeks to use food waste diversion from neighborhood households to reduce the cost for compost for urban farming ventures that it manages.

<div>Hello, my name is Elizabete Saukas (I'm the one in the purple t-shirt, in the photo above), Brazilian, married and living in Michigan, U.S.A. My heart beats for the Orphans and I'm in love with this cause, I'm a volunteer at Orfanato Evangélico (Evangelical Orphanage) - a christian orphanage situated in the city of Feira de Santana, BA, Brazil (close to my hometown).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The purpose of this little <span id=""ecxmisspell-6"">fund raising</span> campaign is to bless the children with a beautiful party and a <span id=""ecxmisspell-7"">fun filled</span> day, and some much needed food donations. The idea is to basically be a gift to the institution for the benefit of the children, bringing lots of smiles to <span id=""ecxmisspell-8"">their</span> faces, through fun games, yummy food, <span id=""ecxmisspell-9"">balloons</span>, trampolines, music and pictures (yeah, they love pictures). There is not much joy being raised in an Orphanage, and I'd just like to bring a little happiness to the neediest of the needy.</div>

<p> <strong>What We Need &amp; What They get</strong></p>
<p>Foreseen date of event: <strong>December 15th 2012.</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Where are your donations going?</p>
<p>Party ""Feast for the orphans"" (food for a party, decoration, photos, amusement, toy rentals): $ 850.00</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style="""">Extra costs (extra fund and fees): $ 150.00</span></p>
<div>Funds for food donation: $ 500.00<br/>Total: $ 1500.00</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>The extra fund is the amount reserved for unlikely, but possible, overbudget scenarios. In case it doesn't happen, all the money will be directed to food donation. The fees it covers are: currency conversion and Indiegogo fees.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If the entire goal is not achieved or surpassed, the funds will become food donations.</div>
<div> </div>

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.4946673740632832""><span>Why do i care with the orphans in Brazil?</span></strong></p>
<p>In Scriptures, we are instructed to care for the Poor, the Widowed and the Orphaned....I choose to attend to the least able of these.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>According to the Brazilian government rules and regulations, a child is allowed to stay in the institution for an initial period of 2 years. During that time efforts are made to get the child adopted locally. Once that time has expired, the child is up for International adoption and in some cases efforts are made to get the child back with his/her biological Mother, or an extended family member.</span></p>
<p>If all these efforts fail, the child is allowed to stay until their 18th birthday and then they are turned loose onto the streets wether they are ready or not. The institution does everything within it's power to prepare these young adults with whatever training they can so that they may have some skills before they are forced to provide for themselves. The sad part is, many of them turn to a life of crime, drugs and prostitution.</p>
<div>The sucess of this campaign will be the <span id=""ecxmisspell-14"">achievement</span> of one of my dreams. A dream to bring just a little joy and love to these young orphans. Little ones, who by no fault of <span id=""ecxmisspell-15"">their</span> own most often suffer pain and loss for a life time.</div>
<div>There is little joy in an orphanage. </div>

Hello, my name is Elizabete Saukas (I'm the one in the purple t-shirt, in the photo above), Brazilian, married and living in Michigan, U.S.A. My heart beats for the Orphans and I'm in love with this cause, I'm a volunteer at Orfanato Evangélico (Evangelical Orphanage) - a christian orphanage situated in the city of Feira de Santana, BA, Brazil (close to my hometown).
 
The purpose of this little fund raising campaign is to bless the children with a beautiful party and a fun filled day, and some much needed food donations. The idea is to basically be a gift to the institution for the benefit of the children, bringing lots of smiles to their faces, through fun games, yummy food, balloons, trampolines, music and pictures (yeah, they love pictures). There is not much joy being raised in an Orphanage, and I'd just like to bring a little happiness to the neediest of the needy.

 What We Need & What They get
Foreseen date of event: December 15th 2012.

Where are your donations going?
Party ""Feast for the orphans"" (food for a party, decoration, photos, amusement, toy rentals): $ 850.00
Extra costs (extra fund and fees): $ 150.00
Funds for food donation: $ 500.00Total: $ 1500.00
 

The extra fund is the amount reserved for unlikely, but possible, overbudget scenarios. In case it doesn't happen, all the money will be directed to food donation. The fees it covers are: currency conversion and Indiegogo fees.
 
If the entire goal is not achieved or surpassed, the funds will become food donations.
 


F.Y.I. : I'll be doing this while I am on vacation visiting my Family and Friends
Don't worry, I'm buying my own round trip ticket! :-)


The Outreach
Why do i care with the orphans in Brazil?
In Scriptures, we are instructed to care for the Poor, the Widowed and the Orphaned....I choose to attend to the least able of these.
According to the Brazilian government rules and regulations, a child is allowed to stay in the institution for an initial period of 2 years. During that time efforts are made to get the child adopted locally. Once that time has expired, the child is up for International adoption and in some cases efforts are made to get the child back with his/her biological Mother, or an extended family member.
If all these efforts fail, the child is allowed to stay until their 18th birthday and then they are turned loose onto the streets wether they are ready or not. The institution does everything within it's power to prepare these young adults with whatever training they can so that they may have some skills before they are forced to provide for themselves. The sad part is, many of them turn to a life of crime, drugs and prostitution.
The sucess of this campaign will be the achievement of one of my dreams. A dream to bring just a little joy and love to these young orphans. Little ones, who by no fault of their own most often suffer pain and loss for a life time.
There is little joy in an orphanage.

<h3>Together we can feed 4,050 families</h3>
<p>Hi! We're Beehive Cheese, a small family creamery in Northern Utah best known for our Barely Buzzed. In 2005 we opened our doors, and we've been making award-winning artisan cheese ever since.</p>
<p>Our new STRETCH GOAL is <strong>$36,000 to produce SIX batches</strong> of Promontory, our base cheddar. All<strong> 8,100 pounds</strong> of Promontory will be donated to the <strong>Utah Food Bank</strong> and has the potential to feed<strong> 4,050 families</strong>.</p>
<p>Your donation will allow us to feed families in need. It will help support our dairy partner and keep our cheesemaking team employed.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588612954/lnwi0efcwvbklwsrmtt4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Due to the cost of milk and labor, we don’t have the cash on hand to produce the cheese</strong> we'd like to donate. That’s why we need your help. Beehive Cheese will take <u>zero profit</u> from the batches of cheese donated to the Utah Food Bank.</p>
<p>If we raise more than our goal, we plan on continuing to use those funds to make as much cheese as possible to keep the donations going strong.</p>
<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>Since March we’ve done all we can do to support the community through in kind donations of about 2,600 pounds of cheese to the Lantern House, Catholic Community Services, and the Utah Food Bank. That food was distributed to about 1,000 homeless individuals and roughly 500 families. At this point, we’ve run out of cheese in our coolers to donate and still fill customer orders. </p>
<p>Our community is facing depression-era levels of unemployment, with 1 in 7 workers out of job needing cash and food assistance. Food Banks are in desperate need. They’ve seen a major increase in families seeking assistance. These families need nutrient dense, versatile foods to get by. </p>
<p>With retail and food service demand down, Beehive is only producing at a fourth of our capacity. <strong>Our vats are open and ready to produce cheese for the community.  </strong><br/> </p>

</h3>
<p>The Congo Square Market offers <b><i>entrepreneurship opportunities for
approximately 15 local market vendors of color per summer</i>.</b> The Market’s financial assistance to vendors has proven crucial in enabling young farmers and cooks from underrepresented communities to develop and sustain their own businesses. <br/></p><ul>
</ul><div>
<p>The Market also <b><i>sponsors paid apprenticeship opportunities
for 5 youth of color</i></b> to receive one-on-one guidance and setup and take down the Market.</p>
<p>CSM hosts healthcare practitioners from the Ithaca Health Alliance and Cayuga Medical Center who <b><i>provide free health services at the Market to community members</i></b>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>CSM also plans to host theme nights featuring Black History in Tompkins County, an Open Mic Night, Women’s Empowerment, and a Health and Wellness day in collaboration with a Bike Clinic held by Recycle Ithaca’s Bikes (RIBS). CSM will also have a table with low-cost books and reading materials, with an emphasis on Black cultural and political heritage.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout the summer the market grows into a collective beyond a
predictable nature- vendors of all different kinds join and add to the communal
vibe. The market has been operating strong in this way for 8 years. The
impact is real and vital- the only way to fight endless winters and grandiose
setbacks is to come together.</p>

</div></div>","A little history…

Congo Square is an actual place in New Orleans. This sacred ground was
first used by the Houma People and by slaves in the region as a place to enjoy
a day of freedom. Africans used it as a place to maintain their true status as
free people of Africa. Indigenous peoples and Europeans often joined in the
celebration. Music, abolitionist organization, food, and dance were intertwined
to enjoy this one-day-a-week festival. 
Today,
in Ithaca,
Congo Square Market (or CSM) is a multicultural community that provides affordable Jamaican, Cuban, Ethiopian and soul food, farm produce and local goods, as
well as free healthcare services and entertainment: music, visual art and speakers. Volunteers from Southside Community Center,
Rainbow Healing Center, Youth Farm Project, TC Cornell Cooperative Extension's
Whole Community Project, Rocky Acres Community Farm, Cayuga Medical Center, and Ithaca Health Alliance help
put the market together. The Market's goals are to encourage and build
community, personal health, and a stronger economic base on Ithaca's south side. The market will be open every Friday from 4-8pm from June 5 to
September 4, 2015 at the park next to Southside Community Center, located
at 305 S. Plain St. in Ithaca, New York!
Why We Need Your SupportDonating today will guarantee that Congo Square Market will:
Provide stipends for 5 youth of color and fund their projects
Compensate well-known entertainers (like Thousands of One, Travis Knapp, the Rapid River Boys, visual artists, live solo musicians, DJs, bands, dancers) who will perform for the community
Compensate cultural speakers like Jake Edwards from the nearby Onondaga Nation
Provide a weekly display of fresh fruits and vegetables
Provide 4 health permits for start-up vendors
Raise awareness about the market!!!
By contributing, you not only enable the entertainment, but also the great atmosphere and experience that ensues. You are essentially the catalyst of a multitude of salubrious Friday nights at the Ithaca Southside Community Center!
What the Market Offers to the
Community

The Congo Square Market offers entrepreneurship opportunities for
approximately 15 local market vendors of color per summer. The Market’s financial assistance to vendors has proven crucial in enabling young farmers and cooks from underrepresented communities to develop and sustain their own businesses. 

The Market also sponsors paid apprenticeship opportunities
for 5 youth of color to receive one-on-one guidance and setup and take down the Market.
CSM hosts healthcare practitioners from the Ithaca Health Alliance and Cayuga Medical Center who provide free health services at the Market to community members. 

CSM also plans to host theme nights featuring Black History in Tompkins County, an Open Mic Night, Women’s Empowerment, and a Health and Wellness day in collaboration with a Bike Clinic held by Recycle Ithaca’s Bikes (RIBS). CSM will also have a table with low-cost books and reading materials, with an emphasis on Black cultural and political heritage.

Throughout the summer the market grows into a collective beyond a
predictable nature- vendors of all different kinds join and add to the communal
vibe. The market has been operating strong in this way for 8 years. The
impact is real and vital- the only way to fight endless winters and grandiose
setbacks is to come together.

 are overwhelmed with gratitude to all who have contributed so far.  
We've reached our stated public goal of $10,500 and we are excited about
 the possibility  of reaching our stretch goal, which would allow us to 
make even more  needed improvements.<br/><br/>Our new goal is <strong>$20,000</strong>
 and the additional funding will go to unforeseen costs not in our 
original plan for the campaign. Improvements that the Odyssey Bookshop 
could really benefit from, but weren't a priority until we met our first
 goal. Some of the things we would love to add:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>conversion and training for staff while we upgrade to our new point of sale and inventory system.</strong></li>

What We Need</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The
Odyssey Bookshop of South Hadley, MA is a locally owned independent bookshop
committed to offering a quality selection of affordable new, bargain, and gently
read books, as well as gifts and educational items for customers of all ages
and backgrounds. We are passionate about the written word and seek to share our
love of reading to help create and sustain a community of lifelong readers. We
strive to provide a hospitable and nurturing environment to encourage the
healthy exchange of ideas by hosting numerous readings, book groups, and panel
presentations. We are committed to engaging with the many diverse peoples and
organizations of our community, particularly in the Pioneer Valley of Western
Massachusetts, but also on a national and international scale, to work towards
the goals of a knowledgeable public and a peaceful and environmentally
sustainable planet.</p>Please help the Odyssey
continue to provide top-notch customer service through upgraded computer
systems. Our technology—in-store sales system; computer network, and even our
public wireless system—is aging. Much of our hardware is more than ten years
old and we’ve been limping along for some time. It’s time to upgrade and we
need your help!
<p><b>Here’s what we hope to do:</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Purchase and install our first real file server to help
us organize, store and secure our critical information. This will allow us to
work more efficiently, collaborate on projects and improve communications. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Update and renovate our point-of-sale system. We have
held off upgrading software because our hardware--some in its teenage
years--cannot support the newer system. We need to replace hardware and update
software. This will improve our service, while guarding our customers against
expanding security threats such as identity theft.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Upgrade our internal public wireless systems to make them
faster and more secure. This will improve staff productivity and be a
convenience for our customers.

GoldFusion begins at the fabric level by infusing premium materials with gold nanoparticles which remain 99% effective after 100 washes, 3x longer than the industry standard. What does this mean for you? Drying times that are 3x faster and anti-odor protection ​for over 100 washes. And yes, it's non toxic and completely environmentally friendly.
WHO'S TALKINGABOUT RHONE
Our Past Products Are Industry Leaders -And This New Line Will Be Even Better
 
""Move over Lululemon, Rhone is about to take overthe men's activewear market.""-Forbes Magazine
 
THE BENEFITS GoldFusion is a proprietary application that can be applied to fabrics to enhance its performance attributes. Below are examples of how GoldFusion supercharges performance apparel.     






 
BEST IN CLASS
 
Fabric technology applied to custom fabrics to further boost performance


 
LOW BRANDING
 
Sophisticated and low branded approach to be appropriate for any setting.


THE PIECES GoldFusion is applied to three of the industry's best fabrics to create the ultimate performance apparel. Choose which pieces below appeal to you most and shop them in the perks section.  Merino wool is a naturally wicking and anti-odor fabric. Pairing that with performance boosting benefits of GoldFusion technology creates an ultra-quick wicking, anti-odor powerhouse of a shirt that has the feel of a natural fiber and the performance of a synthetic. The Captain Merino Tee leads where others follow. Sold in black and gray.A brand new performance fabric, the Delta uses your sweat to cool you while magically not weighing you down like cotton. Combined with GoldFusion properties such as anti-odor, this is one of the ultimate pieces for those who sweat heavily or live in hot environments.Developed specifically for our indiegogo supporters, the Phase is a brand-new, multi-sport short built with power mesh ventilation panels, DWR for water resistance, and a GoldFusion liner that wicks sweat, dries quick, and is anti-odor. We added two side pockets, one with a media pocket to keep your phone safe, and a zippered back pocket. From travel to trails to training, the Phase short is made for what's next. Sold in Black.Designed after our best-selling Sequoia 1/4 zip pullover, the Sequoia Air 1/4 zip pullover combines style with performance. Delta fabric infused GoldFusion technology creates a 1/4 zip that wicks moisture, fights odor and protects you from the sun. This is the perfect pullover for a Spring or Fall round of golf or to pack away for multi-day travel or hikes.These days towels go from the gym, to the mat, to the court and back again. The problem is they haven't evolved much from those scratchy, white health club towels of the past. Enter the world's greatest gym towel. Made from a soft and durable blend of bamboo and cotton fibers, this towel can absorb up to three times its weight in water and exhibits natural anti-microbial properties. Plus, we treated it with our patented anti-odor technology so things stay fresh in your gym bag.365-DAYSATISFACTION GUARANTEE We've been delivering quality products with return rates well below industry average for 2 years. However, we're so confident in this new technology that we are offering our most flexible return policy ever. For 365-days after shipment, indiegogo backers can return their product(s) for their money back (if it is unworn) or exchange it for any equal valued item on our website if it has been worn. We want your first experience with Rhone to be a great one.WHAT OUR USERSHAVE SAID ABOUT US 
""Love the unique style. Most of all, love how the shirt does not retain any odor."" - Sung P. 
""I ordered these for my son for Christmas and he is loving the shirts. He had previously been using the Lululemon Silverscent Technology shirts and was quite impressed by Rhone's products during his workouts. The Rhone shirts had no odor after they dried out and have a nice comfortable feel when he works out, so it's safe to say he will be making other orders from Rhone in the future!"" - Marcia K. 
""I'm a true Rhone believer now!"" - Roy C. 
HOW IT WORKS 

1

 
SPHERICAL NANOPARTICLES
 
Perfectly spherical nanoparticles are formed. A Nanometer is one-billionth of one meter. At this scale, nanoparticles exhibit beneficial properties that do not exist at other sizes and are being used in electronics, medicines, and other industries. We're applying this new technology to premium fabrics.


2

 
ECO-SAFE
 
A non-toxic, non-ionic, 100%-stable water based solution is formed from these nanoparticles. The solution is so eco-safe that you can drink it.




3

 
APPLICATION
 
A 100-horsepower compressor ""mists"" the water based solution onto the fabric before it is cut and sewn, making sure the solution covers the entire garment. This process creates virtually zero emissions and nothing is released into the environment.


4

 
PRODUCTION
 
The fabrics are then transferred to our factory for cutting and sewing and the final product is produced.



DOES IT WORK
 

Nanotechnology is changing the way we live and GoldFusion is the next application of that. GoldFusion is the best performing fabric application on the market. But don't take our word for it, let the guys with PHDs and lab coats show you...
DRY TIMES INCREASE AFTER THE SAME FABRIC IS TREATED BY UP TO 3X
Water has a surface tension, which our technology breaks, making it harder for water to bind to the fabric and easier to be wicked away. The above video shows an example of dry times between GoldFusion treated and untreated.



 
COOLING BENEFIT
 
Tests show that GoldFusion treated fabric dries up to 3x faster than the same non-treated fabric.






 
ODOR FIGHTING
 
Fabric samples were infected then measured at contact time and then again after 24 hours. By the 24 hour mark (even after 100 washes on the fabric), the fabric showed virtually a 100% reduction.




 
ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
 
As shown in our lab testing, after 10 washes there was virtually zero emissions. The below graph shows how that compares to the competition.



WHY Most of the clothing brands on the market feign innovation with cool colors, huge logos and cheap venting designs. These technological ""advances"" are holding you back from performing at your best. GoldFusion ensures that your clothing stands up to the rigors needed to accomplish your fitness and health goals.In a world of competition, there's no cutting corners. Rhone uses the most innovative materials and advanced technology available. For the GoldFusion launch, Rhone has partnered with PolarTec to further enhance their best-in-class performance fabrics. GoldFusion is applied directly to these fabrics to create performance capabilities never seen before. Each backer will have a choice of which fabric to purchase in the rewards section.WHAT YOU GET The styles are unique to this campaign and may one day be revered like an old pair of Jordan sneakers. This is the opportune time to get first access to our greatest clothing line to-date at a rare discounted price.WHAT WE NEED We have industry leading shorts designed, tested and highly reviewed from the past 3 years in business, but now we need to update their technology. This is where you come in. To bring this technology to market and to purchase the machinery needed to treat the clothing we are raising $35,000. Help us get there by pre-ordering some new gear.

My Story
 
My name is Javier Haro and this is my campaign and entrepreneurial vision is to raise startup capital for Ba Ba Bulli & SocialMediaRestaurants.com 
 
You might be asking why Crowdfunding two businesses? It’s simple. Our local economy needs it and lending institutions don’t’ want to take a chance on start-ups, who ironically are the job creators of our country! I have decided to “Take the Recession by the Horns” and stimulate the local economy and create jobs. As a tapas aficionado, entrepreneur, and social media junkie I saw many new exciting opportunities in social media and the technology space for the restaurant community here in Chicago. Closing my restaurant HARO in 2008 and struggling to find a job, I had to reinvent myself. I decided to create my own job and a few others to help my fellow struggling Chicagoans! 
 
Ba Ba Bulli will be one of the first Spanish/Mexican mobile food truck that I would consider the better part of what is known as the peaceful  “The Third Revolution”( www.madridfusionmex.com ). Spain and Mexico coming together to share and contribute to tourism and new culinary innovations and art that began in 2010 to celebrate the fusion of pre-Hispanic and Spanish cuisines that gave rise to Mexican food.  As a Spanish tapas aficionado for the past 5 years and of Mexican descent, this new revolution was one that I wanted to participate in!  The name Ba Ba Bulli was inspired by forward-thinker Feran Adria better known as “El Bulli” ( www.elBulli.com ), the “Running of the Bulls” or encierro in Pamplona, Spain  and over drinking a nice glass of vintage tempranillo wine with the label “Ba Ba Bulle” a few years back.  I was also motivated by the twitter social media success of west coast food truck KOGI ( www.kogibbq.com ) and their Korean fusion Mexican tacos. This lead to my culinary creation of the first the Spanish fusion Mexican “Bullrrito”. Other culinary contributions to the food truck will be to incorporate charcuterie, artisan cheeses, variety of chillie pepper salsas, and for the first time in Chicago artisan Galician seafood! 
 
 
My second business is SocialMediaRestaurants.com. The vision is to be the leader in sales and social intelligence of over 300,000 independent restaurant operators. Our Social CRM and proprietary technology will help new and existing companies to increase sales productivity, brand awareness, and velocity for companies looking to advertise or sell their product or services to the decision makers in the restaurant market. I’ve been very fortunate to have conversations and peak the interest of some great companies such as Groupon, Yelp, OpenTable, GrubHub, SproutSocial, and many others. In a day of new technology and social networks SocialMediaRestaurants.com will close the gap by bridging the tech space with the restaurant industry.  
 
Where You Come In

<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""5"">Our Story</font></h3>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3"">We are a group of students and teachers dedicated to helping children with autism and other special needs in Tanzania, Africa. In 2008 Dr. Marilyn Kaff, a special education professor from Kansas State University, went on her first trip to Tanzania. Her goal was to help improve special education and teacher training at the Sebastion Kolowa University College. During that time she traveled to a number of villages and small communities where schools were being set up to help youth with severe disabilities including autism. What she discovered there inspired her to give of her time and talents. But her trip was limited, and she knew she needed to come back. Since that time she has returned each year with teams of volunteer students from Kansas State University to help identify autistic children, and then to train the local teachers and parents how to teach them. </font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3"">Our fundraising goals are two fold. This year we will have 8 new student volunteers coming with us. We want to help them raise some of the funds needed to get to Tanzania. Total trip costs are around $4000 per person. If enough funds are raised, we anticipate offering partial scholarships to help each volunteer get to Tanzania. Our other fundraising goal is start a new series of Sustainability Projects. Please see the Impact section below for details. All told the funds will help us to make a substantial difference in the lives of these children and their families. Funds will be split  between helping volunteers get to Tanzania, and starting Sustainability Projects.</font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3""><br/></font></p>
</div><div>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""5"">The Impact</font></h3>
<p><i><b>1) <font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4"">Specialized Service:</font></b><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4""> </font></i>All of the volunteers are students and faculty with education, psychology, or occupational therapy backgrounds. The more people we can send to Tanzania each year the more training and one on one aid we can give. This training has a multiplier effect. Not only will the volunteers work with dozens of children directly, but they will also have a chance to train teachers and parents who can then use these specialized skills to help the lives of the children in Tanzania. The schools we will be working with this year serve dozens of students with autism or other severe cognitive/ physical impairments. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><i>2) <font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4"">Sustainability Projects:</font></i> </b>Each year that Dr. Kaff has traveled to Tanzania with her volunteers they have purchased and donated hundreds of dollars of teaching supplies.

</div></div>","Our Story
We are a group of students and teachers dedicated to helping children with autism and other special needs in Tanzania, Africa. In 2008 Dr. Marilyn Kaff, a special education professor from Kansas State University, went on her first trip to Tanzania. Her goal was to help improve special education and teacher training at the Sebastion Kolowa University College. During that time she traveled to a number of villages and small communities where schools were being set up to help youth with severe disabilities including autism. What she discovered there inspired her to give of her time and talents. But her trip was limited, and she knew she needed to come back. Since that time she has returned each year with teams of volunteer students from Kansas State University to help identify autistic children, and then to train the local teachers and parents how to teach them. 

Our fundraising goals are two fold. This year we will have 8 new student volunteers coming with us. We want to help them raise some of the funds needed to get to Tanzania. Total trip costs are around $4000 per person. If enough funds are raised, we anticipate offering partial scholarships to help each volunteer get to Tanzania. Our other fundraising goal is start a new series of Sustainability Projects. Please see the Impact section below for details. All told the funds will help us to make a substantial difference in the lives of these children and their families. Funds will be split  between helping volunteers get to Tanzania, and starting Sustainability Projects.


The Impact
1) Specialized Service: All of the volunteers are students and faculty with education, psychology, or occupational therapy backgrounds. The more people we can send to Tanzania each year the more training and one on one aid we can give. This training has a multiplier effect. Not only will the volunteers work with dozens of children directly, but they will also have a chance to train teachers and parents who can then use these specialized skills to help the lives of the children in Tanzania. The schools we will be working with this year serve dozens of students with autism or other severe cognitive/ physical impairments. 

2) Sustainability Projects: Each year that Dr. Kaff has traveled to Tanzania with her volunteers they have purchased and donated hundreds of dollars of teaching supplies. This has always come out of their own personal funds. This year we want to do more than just bring supplies. We want to improve the lives of students and their families. Here's what we have planned:

a. Repairing two existing schools:
Two small school buildings in Lushoto, Tanzania need roofs repaired and windows replaced. They also need to have extensive work done to replace the outdoor latrines. Estimated costs are between $2500- $3000 to do all this. Local contractors will be hired to do the work, benefiting the local economy.

b. Creating a Literacy Foundation
Reading materials and supplies are limited and out of touch for most of the schools. As Dr. Kaff puts it, ""People are taught to read words, but not to understand the meaning of what they read."" That's because there are no books native to their culture or relevant to their country. 
We want to work with the local community and artisans in the area to help create a series of books and stories that students can read and listen to. This year we will be accompanied by a video producer from Kansas State University who will be helping us record their stories so that they can be used to create audio/ visual/ and print media. This will not only benefit the children and local communities, but will become an incredible living history for Tanzanians (think StoryCorps). This will be a monumental project, but one that we believe will benefit the community and country. 

c. Community Gardens
We want to help the local schools and Lushoto community set up a garden that would give the children and families a source of fresh food, work, and sustainable income. The involvement of local community leaders and schools will be pivotal to making this a long lasting success, but we feel with the right resources we can set the groundwork for an amazing community building project.


What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $25,000 for this campaign. We know there are many other charitable ways you could be spending your money right now, but here is what makes our campaign stand out.

May 7th, 10am-12pm
Dolores Park
9k - 9 laps - one lap for each full decade women have had the right to vote
Our
Story

Can
you believe that…

100 years ago, women did not have
     the right to vote.
50 years ago, it was legal to pay
     women less than men based on their gender alone.
Today, women earn 77 cents to each
     dollar earned by men. African American women earn 68 cents to the dollar,
     and Latina women earn 58 cents to the dollar.

 
Founded in 1971,
the Women’s Building serves as a symbol of women's empowerment and a reminder
that our work for equality is not over.
 
The Women’s
Building is a woman owned and operated community center located in San
Francisco’s dynamic Mission District. We promote
the wellbeing of women and girls by working for social justice while
simultaneously offering opportunities for individuals to improve their economic
security, personal wellbeing, and connection to a broader community that is working
for change. 
 
We have just
finished a strategic plan, developed collaboratively between our board and staff. One
of our primary goals is to integrate social justice goals more deeply and
pervasively into all our programming – but we need your help!
 
The Women’s
Building Board is sponsoring this walk-a-thon to raise funds to support the
buildings’ ability to make our strategic plan a reality. We believe that
achieving our goals will make a meaningful difference in the community. Come build a
better future for women, one step at a time.
 
The
Impact
The Women’s
Building welcomes over 10,000 visitors each year. The
money raised through this walk-a-thon goes directly to support critical
programming at the Women’s Building, including cutting-edge ESL classes, free
tax prep and an immigrant food pantry. Funds raised here will support us in
our goal: to integrate social justice goals more deeply and pervasively
into all our programming, providing all participants clear opportunities to
engage in social change work themselves.
 
The Women’s
Building is uniquely positioned both to support marginalized communities in
advocating for themselves and to connect women of all backgrounds through
shared experiences. We are a safe space for women to learn, grow, take
leadership, and support their community. We are a symbol of women’s
empowerment and a reminder that our fight for equality is not over. 
 
What
We Need & What You Get
We
need to raise $5,500 by June 30th to support the implementation of
our strategic plan; the walk-a-thon is one of our fundraising events to meet that goal. All funds go directly to programming and building
maintenance to keep our space thriving. If we don’t raise these funds, we will
have to postpone the implementation of our plan, resulting in less effective

<p><b>WHAT IS WOUWI ?</b></p>
<p>Anyone with a pet will answer
exactly the same anywhere in the world: he or she is part of our family . No
matter who you are, where you live, your race, religion or culture: your pet is part of you, your day, your good
times, your habits, your laughter or your bad moments. Your pet is who greets you, listens to you, plays with you and sits
next to you.</p>
<p>That is why pets form part of our
family. We rejoice when pets are well,
enjoyed their company, get angry if they misbehave , we care when they get sick
or are sad ... and we are proud of their achievements or just how beautiful
they look when we go out for a walk .</p>
<p>Wouwi was created for this
reason, with the aim of creating the World’s First Social Network for Pets.</p>
<p>Wouwi is a social network for
pets, where your pet is the true center of attention. Create your pet’s profile, upload updates,
shares what he or she likes, hobbies, race, age, ..., etc.<br/></p>
<p>Wouwi is an app that allows you
to find pets close to you, create groups to go out with, with common interests, common
schedules, to ask questions regarding pet food, care ...</p>
<p>Meet pets around the world with whom
you can create bonds of friendship, information channels, culture and experiences,
and on how pets similar to yours live in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Make your pet be known

</div></div>","WHAT IS WOUWI ?
Anyone with a pet will answer
exactly the same anywhere in the world: he or she is part of our family . No
matter who you are, where you live, your race, religion or culture: your pet is part of you, your day, your good
times, your habits, your laughter or your bad moments. Your pet is who greets you, listens to you, plays with you and sits
next to you.
That is why pets form part of our
family. We rejoice when pets are well,
enjoyed their company, get angry if they misbehave , we care when they get sick
or are sad ... and we are proud of their achievements or just how beautiful
they look when we go out for a walk .
Wouwi was created for this
reason, with the aim of creating the World’s First Social Network for Pets.
Wouwi is a social network for
pets, where your pet is the true center of attention. Create your pet’s profile, upload updates,
shares what he or she likes, hobbies, race, age, ..., etc.
Wouwi is an app that allows you
to find pets close to you, create groups to go out with, with common interests, common
schedules, to ask questions regarding pet food, care ...
Meet pets around the world with whom
you can create bonds of friendship, information channels, culture and experiences,
and on how pets similar to yours live in other parts of the world.
Make your pet be known
internationally!
Wouwi is a ""global
communications app"" which allows you to create and upload pictures, memes,
comments, and see how the number of friends grow daily.

<p><strong>About The Family Business... </strong></p>
<p><span>Kinnie Haskins is a 31 year young woman who is absolutely in love with what she does. Around 2009, while she was working another job, she decided that she wanted to bring her business plan to life. She already baked all day everyday when she wasn’t working and she thought this would be perfect to open up a business. She just pushed herself into full drive to open Cakes Come True Bakery. On August 1, 2011 she officially opened her online company. And needless to say, she was, and still is, overly excited her business. Cakes Come True Bakery is her baby. And she wants to see it grow just as much as you do. As little as $1 will get you to become a part of history.</span></p>
<p><span>Recruited to help was her mother Mary and sister Jennifer. Jennifer was her assistant on the Food Network’s show Cupcake Wars. This family business needs a little help to grow. These women are looking to build a great addition to the community.</span></p>
<p><span>This is the passion for the women of Cakes Come True Bakery. Kinnie is completely in love with what she does. She has drain her savings and everything in her bank account to make this possible. We just need some help to get it going. Designing and creating memories for people is the legacy of Cakes Come True Bakery. We need this dream to come true. Kinnie has been baking ever since she was a little girl of the age of 5 with her father and mother Mary. Her sister just loves to dedicate her off time to helping her build the business. The recipes we use belong to the family and we just upgrade them a bit for the new day. At this time Cakes Come True Bakery offer so many varieties of items and over 150 cupcake combinations. WOW I know right.  We get rave reviews from the customers, friends and family about the work we put into this.This is not just a job but a passion. Everyone loves the taste and design presented. When we competed on Food Network’s Cupcake Wars the judges even loved the cupcakes. And that was on camera viewed by millions. So, this project needs to be successful so that everyone can taste a little bit of old southern perfection with a twist. Did I mention we started a groupon with over 700 people who purchased the groupon? We need a place so the customers can have to most rewarding experience ever.

<p><strong>My name is Yothin Amnuayphol.</strong> I have been serving coffee and food to the PNCA (Pacific Northwest College of Art) community for the past 12 years. My relationship with PNCA and the Portland art community goes back even further as a former art student. I graduated from PNCA in 1988 with a major in Ceramics. I have kept close ties with the college and when the opportunity arose to work in such a creative neighborhood, I was happy to repond. In the near future, PNCA will be moving to its new home in the North Park Blocks. For me to continue to be a part of PNCA and to continue the strong relation I have with the school community of students, staff, alumni and the neighborhood, I will have to transform from an indoor coffee stand to a mobile van.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>My project is to transform a Citroen van, a unique European vechicle I strongly feel would be a great addition to the future of the creative community. We have found the vehicle in France from a reputable dealer and he is ready to go ahead with the project. The proposed funds being raised from the project would primarily be dedicated to purchasing this van which would be transformed into one of the most original espresso vans you would see around town. </h3>
<p>The entire project would cost around $30,000.00. I am planning on using my own savings and some loans to cover what I have proposed..</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Thanks for all your support and please help get the word out to your families and friends. Indiegogo also has an easy way to share information. If you want to know more about my project, please contact me at <a href=""mailto:blackdogbkk@yahoo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blackdogbkk@yahoo.com</a> or stop by at PNCA and we will talk over coffee.</h3>

</div></div>","My name is Yothin Amnuayphol. I have been serving coffee and food to the PNCA (Pacific Northwest College of Art) community for the past 12 years. My relationship with PNCA and the Portland art community goes back even further as a former art student. I graduated from PNCA in 1988 with a major in Ceramics. I have kept close ties with the college and when the opportunity arose to work in such a creative neighborhood, I was happy to repond. In the near future, PNCA will be moving to its new home in the North Park Blocks. For me to continue to be a part of PNCA and to continue the strong relation I have with the school community of students, staff, alumni and the neighborhood, I will have to transform from an indoor coffee stand to a mobile van.


My project is to transform a Citroen van, a unique European vechicle I strongly feel would be a great addition to the future of the creative community. We have found the vehicle in France from a reputable dealer and he is ready to go ahead with the project. The proposed funds being raised from the project would primarily be dedicated to purchasing this van which would be transformed into one of the most original espresso vans you would see around town. 
The entire project would cost around $30,000.00. I am planning on using my own savings and some loans to cover what I have proposed..


Thanks for all your support and please help get the word out to your families and friends. Indiegogo also has an easy way to share information. If you want to know more about my project, please contact me at blackdogbkk@yahoo.com or stop by at PNCA and we will talk over coffee.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Meet Ed and Eats</h2>
<p>My name is Ed and I need your help in bringing Eats to life! <br/>I've been a chef for seven years and have worked everywhere from meals on wheels and hospital kitchens, to a tapas food cart to fine dining molecular gastronomy based restaurants. While every kitchen and chef has helped shape me as a cook, I've always maintained a deep love for simple, but never boring, meals. I mean those meals that you dive into knowing that not only are they going to taste incredible but that they're also going to nourish you. Those meals that comfort but also inspire you. That, at it's heart, is my vision for Eats. Delectably creative sandwiches and sides made with ingredients sourced from the bounty of California, from Valley to Coast, that will brighten your spirit and make your tastebuds wild with joy! </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>So, what will the funds go towards?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>Excellent question! The cart itself is covered and has been assembled by the fantastic crew at Fresno's Quality Concessions. The cart is a fully functional mobile kitchen complete with range, oven, hood, fridge, freezer, deep fryer, three compartment sink... if you need it to prepare rad meals, it'll be in there. However, high quality equipment didn't leave me with much spare change and this is where you come in!</p>
<p>Donations to this campaign will provide me with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic cooking equipment and supplies such as saute pans, stock pots, hotel pans, cutting boards, spatulas, spoons, tongs, etc. </li>
<li>Beautification of the Eats-mobile! Help us turn a lean, clean, cooking machine into a cart that will catch your eye. Plans include the application of the Eats logo plus a complete paint job. </li>
<li>A compost bin or worm box in order to turn food scraps into soil gold!</li>
<li>Administration and advertisement costs. Getting the business end of things streamlined and making the business known can rack up some serious cash. Help us get the Eats name out and also help me keep things organized. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Eats matters</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My passion is cooking and in sharing those creations with others. When you donate to this campaign, you'll be helping a small business find it's feet. A business that, when it succeeds, will open up employment opportunities to other aspiring cooks, generate more support for local farms, spread the word on whole foods, and educate people about the value of California's agricultre and viticulture communities. The Valley area is, ironically, a food desert. More and more fast food chains go in and less and less meals made with care, joy, and whole foods are consumed. Eats is hoping to help change the tide. </p>
<p>MFK Fisher succinctly wrote ""first we eat, then we do everything else"". How can you hope to do good if you don't eat well? As part of my ""doing good"" long-term goal for Eats, I will put a portion of my profits toward local food banks, supporting school gardens, and other deserving non-profits that work for the good of the people that help grow the food for America's tables and support sustainable agriculture. I'm invested in helping to maintain the health and growth of our agriculture because my wife and in-laws run Couture Farms; a fourth generation, organic, family-owned operation, here in the Central Valley's west side. Seeing the hard work that they and all of their employees put into the continuation of their business, as well as the work of their neighbors and fellow farmers, has made me want to connect consumers with the farmers behind their food and also pass on some education to my future customers. A good meal shouldn't just satisfy hunger. It should inspire, build community, and educate. I also refuse to ""greenwash"" anything I do. From my business cards (made from recycled paper and printed with low VOC soy ink) to my t-shirts (organic cotton) to the food that I will provide (focus on organic and whole ingredients), I will stand by my commitment to tread as lightly as possible on our planet by always searching for the most conscientious option. </p>

</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>The Cost of Foreclosure for Cities and Communities</strong></p>

In exchange, we'll pay your mortgage every month for as long as your house remains painted. Here are a few things we're looking for. You must own your home. It cannot be rented or leased. We'll paint the entire outside of the house, minus the roof, the windows and any awnings. Painting will take approximately 3 - 5 days. Your house must remain painted for at least one month and may be extended up to a year. If, for any reason, you decide to cancel after one month or if we cancel the agreement with you, we'll repaint your house back to the original colors.If you're prepared to splash ads on your home just submit the application form below. You can post home photos on our Facebook page. We review every application. If your home has the 'it' factor a team member will reach out to you.
For as little as $4, you can make a difference. Please contribute to our campaign.  Your generosity will help us save more families.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>I am a mom of 7 kids with a passion for reading.  I heard about the 
""Little Free Library"" project and want to bring ten of these to my 
community.  I love to read and would like to inspire this in others.  I 
want to get my children and other children in the community involved in 
reading and helping others.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am aiming to raise $2950 to construct and install freestanding 
""libraries"" that house donated books.  The approximate cost for 
materials, installation and registration of a library is $275 each.  All
 of the labor required for construction and installation will be donated
 by community and family members.  If additional funds are raised, more 
libraries will be built and installed in surrounding neighborhoods. </p>
<p>These
 libraries are essentially small, enclosed bookshelves that hold 25-50 
books or more.  They are placed in local neighborhoods where people are 
able to gather.  Books are donated or borrowed at any time with the 
theme---""borrow one leave one"". The libraries contain books for both 
children and adults.  Each 'library' is maintained by a volunteer and is
 located on private property along a walking or biking route.  
Advertising is done through local community organizations and by word of
 mouth.</p>
<p>If we raise less than our goal, we will simply construct fewer libraries and have local fundraisers to complete the project.<br/></p>
<br/><h3>The Impact</h3>With all of the technology constantly surrounding us children (and 
adults) sometimes forget the pleasure to be found in reading a book.  
These libraries help return the joy of reading to people who may have 
forgotten.  They help to increase reading skills in children who might 
not have access to a variety of books. The libraries also give a place 
for others to donate their gently used books that otherwise might be 
thrown away.  A sense of community and social gathering is always a plus.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Share this idea with others so that we can make a difference in the literacy of a community.<br/></span></span></span></span></div>","Short SummaryI am a mom of 7 kids with a passion for reading.  I heard about the

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The Shoebox Project is a non-profit initiative that collects small gifts, which are packaged in shoeboxes, and distributed to women in shelters just before the holidays. Each shoebox is approximately valued at $50.00 each so we would like to raise money to help purchase enough small gifts to fill over 30 shoeboxes! <br/></p>
<p>This year the Burlington Shoebox Project would like to surpass our goal of last year and donate 100 shoeboxes in total, to all the shelters in the Halton region. So we are getting started a little bit earlier this year.<br/></p>
<p>My name is Crystal Foster and I heard about the Shoebox Project from a coworker last year during the holiday season. She came to me one morning after she arrived at work to let me know about a great initiative she had heard about on the radio. She had approached myself and some of the other employees in hopes we would be able to help her fill a couple shoeboxes to send to a women's shelter in Toronto. I thought this was a wonderful cause but I knew of a place a lot closer to home that would benefit from these shoeboxes. </p>
<p>So I signed up to run the Burlington/Milton chapter to donate shoeboxes to two local women's shelters in our very own community. It was three weeks before Christmas when I informed my friends, family, and coworkers that my goal was to donate 20-25 shoeboxes to a local women's shelter. </p>
<p>5 days before Christmas, the car was loaded up with 30 shoeboxes ready to be delivered! The response by the community was so overwhelming and the joy of being able to make this happen was so amazing that I decided to take part in it again this year.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is $1,000 of which it will be divided amongst over 20 shoeboxes (got to love those 5/$10 deals during the holidays!) </li>
<li>No matter how much is donated by the fundraising date, all the funds will go towards filling as many shoeboxes as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>Putting together a shoebox is simple and this small gesture of kindness is very much appreciated by its recipient. We encourage you to build your own shoebox – either solo or with the help of a friend, your mother, sister, etc. See our suggested items under “Other Ways You Can Help” (below), and then drop-off your decorated shoeboxes at one of our many locations. You can find locations in the 'albums' section on our page!<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you would rather donate a shoebox or a newly purchased ""small gift"" donation to help us reach our goal here are a few ideas of what to include:</p>
<p>- Body or hand lotions<br/>- Makeup (mascara, lipstick, nail polish. etc. Please NO concealer or foundation)<br/>- Toothbrush, toothpaste and floss<br/>- Chocolates, cookies, candies<br/>- Mitts, hats, scarves<br/>- Perfume<br/>- Brushes, combs<br/>- Public transportation tickets/ phone cards<br/>- Gift certificates (ie. McDonald’s, Tim Horton’s, Pharmacies, Wal-Mart) (Please include the receipt!)<br/></p>

the Mind</u></p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p><u>Concept</u></p>
<p>Within
all of us there is a plethora of emotions, desires and aspirations. Each
individual is liable to express each of these and the aspects that make up
every one of them in a variety of ways. The ability to take any number of these
feelings and transpose them onto paper, canvas or into a melody is called
creativity and it is fed by a healthy dose of imagination. Through regularly
indulging in their imagination and years of improving their techniques these
individuals have become artists. As a writer and award winning poet myself I
have had the honor of interacting with and meeting a great many fellow artists.
The idea behind Fragrance of the Mind is to provide a platform for artists to
showcase and market their creations. These men and women are of entirely
different backgrounds and trades, converging to bring you a diversity of
talent. We will be bringing you a splendor of paintings, sketches, literature
and photography. With our current list of talents we intend to further our
selection with time, only enhancing the flavour what we only hope will become
your new favourite guilty pleasure.</p>
<p><u>What
We Will Do</u></p>
<p>When
we are funded we will begin by creating our website. This is where we will sell
the creations of our artists. It will become our hub from which we will branch
out into secondary markets. While our website will be our home base in the long
run we also intend to create an app from which we will be able to sell prints
and sample works. Locally we will be partnering with a special events hall,
where we will be provided space to house our own gallery. This will allow us to
draw attention and hopefully local talent, while providing  yet another platform for our artists to sell
their work.</p>
<p><u>How
You Can Help?</u></p>
<p>As
we already have our initial set of artists we now require the ability to set up
our website; customized to our specifications. We also require the ability to
market ourselves appropriately and through channels that will provide us with
the optimum amount of coverage. Our goal is to both satisfy our artists and our
clients and by funding us you grant us this ability. For us to reach our goal
we need you to share our campaign with those that you know and to support us in
any way that you can. If you have any questions or comments please contact us at

<h3>Fall down seven times, get up eight.  That has been my motto since 2008 when the housing crash sent my family into a tailspin.  My 10-year career as a bank loan office came skidding to a halt.  My husband's business dried up seemingly overnight.  We went from a comfortable life with no credit card debt and a financial plan on-track for a decent retirement to losing everything.  After a year with nearly no income, our credit cards were maxed out, our savings was nearly depleted and our home was in foreclosure.  What did we do? We started over.  We left the small town where we had lived for 10 years and moved to a larger city. My husband found a job with a decent company and I took the Disney travel business (MMP Travel) I had been working part-time to a full-time endeavor.  I worked as many hours as necessary to grow the business -- even working out of my father's hospital room so I could be with him toward the end of his fight with cancer.  Fast forward five years -- we are finally in a place where we once again pay our own bills with no outside help.  We have recovered from several more financial setbacks and continue to forge ahead.  My little travel business now has 15 agents and is continuing to grow -- but we need just a little more help.  I want to take my business to the next level so my family can be fully back on track, but just can't seem to find a way to make the jump. I've read books, taken classes and am even starting on my MBA but I need an expert to help me brand this business and make it a household name.  That's why I'm here.  I have the opportunity to meet with Shark Tank's Daymond John -- a branding expert.  I'm sure this meeting would help me find the path to reach my goals.  The obstacle?  Millionaires charge hefty fees for their time -- more than my small business can absorb at this juncture.  So, I've come here in the hopes that others will help me to give my business the leg up it needs.  I want to swim with a Shark!</h3>
<p><strong>Why Do I Need Help?</strong></p>
<p>Through GameChangerMeetings.com, I have the opportunity to schedule a one-on-one meeting with Daymond John to get his assistance in getting my business where it needs to go.  He can help with branding, marketing,  and, perhaps, even some celebrity endorsements.  He has the skills and experience that I currently lack.  I have no fear of hard work. I just need to know how to work smarter!</p>
<p>As I mentioned, Mr. John's time does not come cheaply.  For a dinner meeting, it is $4,000 plus the cost of the meal.  This sort of meeting is my goal.  If I have only one shot at meeting a man of this caliber, I'd like to make it as long as possible.  I am asking for $5,500 to cover the cost of the meeting, the meal, the Indiegogo fees and the trip to NYC.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire goal, I have the option of shorter meetings with Mr. John.  While I am hoping to have several hours of his time to learn as much as possible, if I have to make do with a 30-minute phone call, I will gladly do it!  Even a little of his knowledge would be a boon to me.</p>
<p><strong>What Do You Get?</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Knowledge!</em> </strong> I will share what I learn from Daymond John.  If you own a small business, you can get game-changing ideas for <em>pennies</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Clothes!</em> </strong> MMP Travel t-shirts</p>
<p><strong><em>Savings!</em>  </strong>Discounts on travel booked through MMP Travel!</p>
<p><strong><em>VIP Tours!</em></strong>  Get a personal tour of Walt Disney World!</p>
<p><strong>Would This REALLY Make A Difference?</strong></p>
<p>This meeting would truly be a game-changer for me.  A few months ago, just as things were finally stabilizing, we got the news that my husband will be laid off.  So, I took on additional work to take care of my family, but my business is the most important thing to me.   Now, I work seven days a week -- nights, weekends, early mornings -- and my business continues to grow.  This meeting the Daymond John would give me the skills and knowledge to take my business to the point where it could once again be my only full-time endeavor.  It would let me support my family while still having some time to enjoy life a little more.</p>
<p><strong>Why Fund <em>Me</em>?</strong> </p>
<p>I give back.  I believe in paying it forward.  Recently, I noticed that travel discounts are often available to active and retired military but not to other critical personnel who make sacrifices to make our lives better -- veterans (who didn't retire), police officers, firefighters and medical personnel.  So, I started a special discount to Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando (our agency's area of specialization) just for them.  I fund this out of my own pocket.  It's my way of saying, ""Thanks.""  The more this company grows, the more I can give.</p>

</div></div>","Create a home. Change a life.
There are over 400,000 youth in the foster care system across the United States.  At age 18 or 21, a foster youth that was never adopted into a family “ages out” of the foster care system, finding themselves out on their own and having to fend for themselves. Over 3,200 foster youth ""age out"" each year in LA County alone.  Without a family or a community to help them make their first home a place that they can truly call their own, many youth struggle with this transition.  Most of these individuals have absolutely no means to furnish their space.Despite the various challenges foster youth face; there remains ambition and determination to reconstruct a stronger future. A Sense of Home (ASOH) is building a volunteer movement across the country beginning in Los Angeles. Using social media to request donations, volunteers collect the donated furniture & household items and bring them to the empty apartment of a former foster youth -- creating their first ever home. The ASOH experience not only offers the youth a new beginning, a sense of “home” and belonging — but a community that is invested in them succeeding. We need funding to create 300 homes in LA for 2015; cost of $1,000/home, and to develop the digital technology to take it nationwide in 2016.  We are hoping to raise money to start furnishing 40 homes for the holiday season and into the new year at a cost of $40,000.
These foster youth find themselves eating on the floor, sleeping on the floor, and studying on the floor -- yet ASOH is capable of providing what they need. ASOH provides the platform to tap into those who want to give, with those who want to volunteer in a meaningful way and connect this movement with these amazing youth.  
BEFORE





AFTER

A Sense of Home will become fully staffed and eventually run by former foster youth. The overhead costs of setting up the structure, leasing trucks & space, hiring staff and creating homes costs approximately $1,000/home.
How does it
work?  

Step 1: Identifying Need.  Through its relationships with nonprofit organizations providing transitional services to foster youth, ASOH identifies youth who are ""aging out"", are able to secure a section 8 Apt, are enrolled in college course and/or have 30 hours of work/week.Step 2: Furniture Collection.  Harnessing the power of social media, volunteers gather donated furniture & household items from within their community utilizing a ASOH-sponsored truck.Step 3: Apartment Furnishing.  Volunteers and the foster youth furnish the youth’s section 8 apartment making the second hand items look and feel like new.BEFOREAFTERStep 4: Housewarming Party.  Volunteers can choose to take the young recipient shopping for groceries, and help them prepare a healthy, simple meal to serve at their housewarming party. Volunteers and donors are invited to warm the ""home"", and the youth's new chapter is celebrated.
Step 5 : Pay it forward. The youth experiences the power of giving while serving as a volunteer to another foster youth during the creation of their home. They learn that ""Everyone can be great, because everyone can serve.” {Martin Luther King Jr.}
Step 6 : Mentorship.  Volunteers who chose to stay connected with a youth are linked with an existing job coaching or mentor programs to acquire parameters & guidelines on coaching a youth towards a successful career path and/or a balanced life.
Step 7: Progress and Engagement. The youth’s progress is tracked on a unique digital platform that keeps the community engaged and connected with their journey.
What is Aging Out?

Federal and state support abruptly ends at age 18 or 21 (depending on the state) and these youth find themselves transitioning into their new lives without anything. Independent Living Programs (ILP) typically terminate when a youth turns 21.  
There are significant social returns and economic savings to be made by simply using what we have (too much stuff & goodness) to outstretch a helping hand to these youth without family and support. The costs of doing nothing effect us all. Conservatively it costs $8 billion to the United States every year.

<p>As with any

several years working together as a team, so we know how to communicate well
with each other and work efficiently. We aim to start small, with just a team
of 5 girls so that we keep our overhead low and we always have the options to
expand our business in the future. We feel that because our business is truly one-of-a-kind,
we will attract a lot of publicity and business. We have a niche that no one
else is currently serving, and we intend to use that to our advantage.  </p>

<br/></div>","Welcome!


First off I'd like to thank you all for taking the time to check out my campaign and read this, it means the world to me! 
My name is Hilary, I’m a 29 year old auto body repair technician from Toronto Canada. I knew since the moment I started working in an auto body shop at the age of 17 that one day I wanted my own shop.  Over the past 12 years I have worked non stop in this industry to build my skills and reputation, and be the best version of myself. I’ve worked for two of the most reputable shops in Canada, Legendary Motorcar and 427 Auto Collision as well as currently teaching auto body at Centennial College. From what started out as me being the sole female in the shop has evolved into 9 of us! Working with so many driven and talented young ladies gave me the idea to start Ink&Iron. We as women CAN succeed in this trade, and we can take it by storm….and  we’re damn good at it!My goal with this campaign is to fund the start up an ALL FEMALE auto body shop. As well as employing a qualified all female staff, I’d like to focus on recruiting and training other young female apprentices in a nurturing and uplifting environment so that they can be the best they can be. Even if our goal isn’t met, every penny will still be put towards opining the shop, and bringing this dream to life!  
What is
INK&IRON all about?
Ink&Iron
will be a first of it’s kind! An all
female auto body repair shop located in Toronto, Ont. Our services will
include everything from general auto body repairs such as minor accident
damage, dents and scratches and rust repair, to restorations, custom cars and
paint.
What will
Ink&Iron have to offer?
• 
Complete auto body repair service 
• 
A friendly, professional, well
trained and qualified staff with over 25+ years combined experience in the auto
body industry
• 
A positive environment for training
and educating future female auto body repair technicians 
• 
A unique, one-of-a-kind business
experience 
• 
A group of talented young ladies who
are very passionate about auto body repair. Whether it’s getting you car
looking its best again after an accident, restoring that old muscle car you’ve
had sitting around in the garage, or building you a complete custom car you
could only dream of, our number one goal is to make YOU the customer happy!
Why do we
want to open our own auto body shop?
• 
Spending over 10 years working in the
auto body industry, I’ve seen a lot of people overcharged for sub par work and
this doesn’t sit well with me. I want to offer the Greater Toronto Area top
quality work at competitive rates

If the entire fundraising goal is not met within the time limit, we will keep the funds in account where we will continue to raise the funds through other means until we can buy a truck.

How can a TRUCK combat human trafficking?
We need a truck to:


Visit the families of the children (many who already want their children to work in the bars when they are older) in the center to build relationships that will impact their futures.

Bring children in greatest need to the center (they have to walk home from school far distances on Pedaphile-filled streets)

Transport teams to prevention camps in the Northeast of Thailand to build relationships with families, schools, and students to expose the truth of Pattaya city and offer them opportunities for a better future.
Bring homeless men and women with AIDS to a hospital for care.


    Overcoming Challenges  We realize that a truck is a large investment, and that vehicles also cost gas money and will most likely have other necessary repairs.  Since this truck will be crucial to deepening the impact against human trafficking, we plan to take special care of the truck and have money set aside for immediate repairs before a problem worsens. A friend of the organization cares for vehicles and will help us do frequent check-ups on its health.
We only want to get a truck in very good or new condition so that it will be long-lasting and worth the investment.

<p>BEHAPPY2 is an international online shopping
platform that promotes the shops and businesses within your local
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Choosing between the option of making a purchase
from a business that you<span>  know nothing
about, or from the shop on the corner that supports your club or favourite
association, without losing any of the advantages that go with buying online,
it’s a sure bet that you’d choose the latter option each time.</span></p>
<p>By using BEHAPPY2, you can shop in all the shops
and businesses from your neighbourhood and take advantage of all the offers and
discounts usually associated with buying on the Internet as well.</p>
<p><b><u>How BEHAPPY2 works:</u></b></p>
<p>The real motor behind BEHAPPY2 is you and your
community’s neighbourhood!</p>
<p>BEHAPPY2 provides you with the necessary technology
to set up your own virtual commercial centre. In this commercial centre, the
members within your community can purchase from the suppliers that support them
and who also share your same passion, emotions and philosophy. </p>
<p>In that way, your community’s commercial centre is
supportive and sustainable; this enables it to generate money in order to be
able to develop activities for the community and reward members for their
participation. The buyer is rewarded for his loyalty. The supplier, on merging
with the dynamics of his community, will make a name for himself as being
involved and supportive, more than before. And as a board member of a club or
association, he will establish the groundwork and basis of a new source of structured
and sustainable income.</p>
<p>In this masterly cycle, where economy and culture
are intertwined, fair business practices also have their place.</p>

and physical market: <br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1095581/files/20141214094623-c3.jpg?1418579183"" src="""" style=""width: 375.926px; height: 264px;""/></p><br/>

<p>Each community can create its own personalised
shopping centre on the BEHAPPY2 platform, so that it can generate a structured
and repeated additional income. They will offer their products and services in
line with the needs of the members of their community. This income will also
benefit all community members.</p>
<p>Soon it will be possible for BEHAPPY2 members to
also make their purchases in the actual physical shop of the supplier (instore).
By using a special app, it will not only be possible to locate thousands of
distributors/products, but members will also be able to buy any product or
service using their accumulated discount vouchers or Happys.</p>
<p>This is a new system of payment linked to loyalty
programmes and supporting the community through proactive commercial centres.
And, this is all within the context of a new philosophy: to give thanks and be happy
as well.</p>
<p><b><u>The philosophy of BEHAPPY2:</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>With BEHAPPY2 it is possible to create a solid and
fair commercial activity in which each party that is a part of it feels really
involved.</p>
<p>What’s the point of doing your shopping in
businesses that you don’t share any links or infinity with? A better bet is to
opt for local businesses, showing your support by making your purchases in
their shops.</p>
<p>We can make a conscious decision to adopt a
shopping habit that doesn’t harm small and local businesses that are located in
our neighbourhood.</p>
<p>We can’t keep squeezing the same lemon until there
is no more juice left, yet at the same time hope for a more supportive and just
world.</p>
<p>You won’t have to run from one place to another
just to save ten cents. Support your local shops, who make a daily effort to
greet their loyal customers with a friendly smile. And then, by boosting your
local community, you too will begin to feel happier.</p>
<p>And, if one day you can’t find what you are looking
for in your local shops, you’ll always be able to find it by using BEHAPPY2’s
search engine. Using this search engine, you’ll always be able to locate that
shop or restaurant that you were looking for amongst thousands of other
businesses that believe in the same philosophy.</p>
<p><b><u>A new philosophy requires an alternative plan</u></b></p>
<p>BEHAPPY2 = be happy too = you can be happy as well</p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>We choose to not invest too much money in the traditional Above The Line
method of marketing, and prefer more conventional strategies.</p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>We invest money into making a more efficient system for everyone;
businesses, communities and clients.</p>
<p><span>-<span>  </span></span>The profits generated go to everyone to ensure that everyone is happy.</p>

generous discount off his next purchase, or even reducing the price of his

BEHAPPY2 is an international online shopping
platform that promotes the shops and businesses within your local
neighbourhood.
Choosing between the option of making a purchase
from a business that you  know nothing
about, or from the shop on the corner that supports your club or favourite
association, without losing any of the advantages that go with buying online,
it’s a sure bet that you’d choose the latter option each time.
By using BEHAPPY2, you can shop in all the shops
and businesses from your neighbourhood and take advantage of all the offers and
discounts usually associated with buying on the Internet as well.
How BEHAPPY2 works:
The real motor behind BEHAPPY2 is you and your
community’s neighbourhood!
BEHAPPY2 provides you with the necessary technology
to set up your own virtual commercial centre. In this commercial centre, the
members within your community can purchase from the suppliers that support them
and who also share your same passion, emotions and philosophy. 
In that way, your community’s commercial centre is
supportive and sustainable; this enables it to generate money in order to be
able to develop activities for the community and reward members for their
participation. The buyer is rewarded for his loyalty. The supplier, on merging
with the dynamics of his community, will make a name for himself as being
involved and supportive, more than before. And as a board member of a club or
association, he will establish the groundwork and basis of a new source of structured
and sustainable income.
In this masterly cycle, where economy and culture
are intertwined, fair business practices also have their place.
Our masterful circle of economy, culture, Internet
and physical market: 

Communities that are identified
by sectors:
SPORT (Federations, clubs,
events, fan clubs …)


SOCIAL (Charities, education, environment …) 
CULTURE (Art, music, books,
science, tourism, philosophy, hobbies, movements …) ETHNIC (Nationalities, origin-related or traditions …)
LOCAL
(Village,city, region, exhibitions, etc.)
Each community can create its own personalised
shopping centre on the BEHAPPY2 platform, so that it can generate a structured
and repeated additional income. They will offer their products and services in
line with the needs of the members of their community. This income will also
benefit all community members.
Soon it will be possible for BEHAPPY2 members to
also make their purchases in the actual physical shop of the supplier (instore).
By using a special app, it will not only be possible to locate thousands of
distributors/products, but members will also be able to buy any product or
service using their accumulated discount vouchers or Happys.
This is a new system of payment linked to loyalty
programmes and supporting the community through proactive commercial centres.
And, this is all within the context of a new philosophy: to give thanks and be happy
as well.
The philosophy of BEHAPPY2:

With BEHAPPY2 it is possible to create a solid and
fair commercial activity in which each party that is a part of it feels really
involved.
What’s the point of doing your shopping in
businesses that you don’t share any links or infinity with? A better bet is to
opt for local businesses, showing your support by making your purchases in
their shops.
We can make a conscious decision to adopt a
shopping habit that doesn’t harm small and local businesses that are located in
our neighbourhood.
We can’t keep squeezing the same lemon until there
is no more juice left, yet at the same time hope for a more supportive and just
world.
You won’t have to run from one place to another
just to save ten cents. Support your local shops, who make a daily effort to
greet their loyal customers with a friendly smile. And then, by boosting your
local community, you too will begin to feel happier.
And, if one day you can’t find what you are looking
for in your local shops, you’ll always be able to find it by using BEHAPPY2’s
search engine. Using this search engine, you’ll always be able to locate that
shop or restaurant that you were looking for amongst thousands of other
businesses that believe in the same philosophy.
A new philosophy requires an alternative plan
BEHAPPY2 = be happy too = you can be happy as well

-  Our efficiency is based on making things viral (on the Internet). Form a

<p><strong>*** New goal: $10,000 *** </strong></p>
<p><em>This effort has exceeded my wildest expectations in helping Drake open Cluck. <em>After 24 hours we have reached over $3700 dollars from 80 donors to cover over 25% of the original zoning costs.</em> It truly reflects the community excitement and commitment to seeing Cluck open on Broadway.</em></p>

<p>Cluck is fighting to revitalize a blighted vacant building into a tax paying Providence based business. A few determined and politically connected neighbors have used a technicality to overturn the zoning boards varience decision.</p>
<p>The legal costs and delays to opening a store that has a seasonally driven business will cost the owner Drake Patten a large amount of money. The zoning costs and fighting to keep the granted varience has cost Cluck well over $10,000 dollars so far.</p>

<h3><b>How you can help make this
happen  </b></h3>
<p>Brazilian Day Philadelphia aims to bring the best of Brazil to Philadelphia
by celebrating the rich culture and diverse ethnic heritage that makes Brazil special. Although this project
represents our largest and most costly undertaking, we believe in the
importance of building community and enriching lives through the arts. Due to the fact that many large corporations have the policy of not providing financial support to events that have not been around for a period of years, we are faced with the challenge of finding sponsorship outside of the group of companies that already sponsor the events within the PECO Multicultural Festival Series. As a small, non-profit organization, Project Capoeira needs your help to raise the funds needed to produce this festival as it is free to the public. </p>
<p>You have a unique opportunity to kick start a new tradition and showcase
the Brazilian culture by supporting Philadelphia’s very first Brazilian Day,
which promises to grow in size and popularity for years to come. All donations
are tax-deductible. Event proceeds will support Project Capoeira.</p>

Due to the fact that many large corporations have the policy of not providing financial support to events that have not been around for a period of years, we are faced with the challenge of finding sponsorship outside of the group of companies that already sponsor the events within the PECO Multicultural Festival Series. As a small, non-profit organization, Project Capoeira needs your help to raise the funds needed to produce this festival as it is free to the public. 
You have a unique opportunity to kick start a new tradition and showcase
the Brazilian culture by supporting Philadelphia’s very first Brazilian Day,
which promises to grow in size and popularity for years to come. All donations
are tax-deductible. Event proceeds will support Project Capoeira.
Your donation will help us pay for event expenses, which include: 


Performer fees

Instrument rentals

Stage and Great Plaza area decorations

City permits and event insurance

Emergency Medical Services


Media and marketing materials and related fees (e.g. website,
TV commercial, brochures)

We hope that you can celebrate the day with us and hope you are able to
help us start a new tradition by donating your money. If you are unable to donate your money, please help us get the word out, make some noise about the campaign, and consider donating your time as a volunteer for the event (see event website to register). We appreciate your time and consideration. Thank you in advance for your generosity.If you'd like to make a monetary donation, but don't feel comfortable to do so online via credit card, please make a check payable to ""Project Capoeira"" and mail to the address below. Delphine Dos SantosChief Managing DirectorProject Capoeira, Inc.1213 Race Street, Ground Floor, Philadelphia, PA19107215-601-9117, 215-317-1392BrazilianDayPhiladelphia@gmail.com",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Hello, and thanks for stopping by..</h3>
<p>In case you weren't sure after the video, my name is... Richard Brownsdon. </p>
<p>I'm passionate about connecting you with the amazing work that inspiring social entrepreneurs are doing all around the world. It's my aim to introduce you to their work, and encourage you to start your own projects that make the world a better place.  </p>
<ul><li>I've been working on my <a href=""http://inspiringadventures.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Inspiring Adventures</a> project for almost exactly one year to achieve this, with both successes and failures. </li></ul>
<ul><li>I've run successful events in London with <a href=""http://westminster.the-hub.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hub Westminster</a>, <a href=""http://escapethecity.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Escape the City</a> and others, and you can see more videos of my work <a href=""http://pinterest.com/brownsdon/the-work-i-do/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here on pinterest</a>. </li></ul>
<ul><li>I'm crowd funding to help support the first international Inspiring Adventure.  In October 2012, I designed a learning journey around Brazil. You can see <a href=""http://inspiringadventures.co.uk/merry-christmas-a-round-up-of-2012"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the original video I made for that here</a>. I failed to find enough people to join me, maybe because of that video, so now I'm going to do it myself, and make it 5 times more Inspiring and Adventurous!</li></ul>
<h3>The Inspiring Adventure</h3>
<p>Brazil is the 5th largest country in the world by area, the 5th largest by population, and some time in 2013, it's going to become the 5th largest economy.  The country has raised 40 million people out of poverty in the last decade alone. It's an emerging super power and is going to be the host of the next World Cup and the next Olympic Games. </p>
<p>From February 5th to March 15th, I'll be spending 5 weeks on an Inspiring Adventure around all 5 regions of Brazil.</p>
<p>My goal is to meet social entrepreneurs and amazing people working on inspiring projects in every region, and to share their stories with you.  Of course I'll also be having adventures along the way..</p>
<p>You can see my work-in-progress itinerary <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtZWnIZ1jzNOdHA2cWdnMms2UGhZSUx5YW9MVHlPRlE#gid=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here on Google Docs.</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As well as my international flights, I'm putting in £1500 of my own money for this Inspiring Adventure.  I don't think anyone should pay for me to have a holiday, so I am of course covering all my own food, drink and fun weekend activities.</p>
<p>But I won't be able to achieve my mission to get to meet social entrepreneurs in all 5 regions within 5 weeks without your help.</p>
<p>What I'll be spending money on:</p>
<ul><li>Supporting social enterprises. I want to support the projects of the social entrepreneurs I meet. I want to purchase the services or products they offer, give them a gift, or give them a small donation. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Transport. Brazil is a huge country, and getting around it in 5 weeks is going to be expensive. Where possible, I'll use local transport, but severals legs of the journey will require internal flights and other methods.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Accommodation. When I can, I'll be couchsurfing, but that works best in the big cities. At other times, I plan to stay in sustainable, community owned hostels.</li></ul>
<p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
<p><strong>£10 - Inspiration.</strong></p>
<p>Be inspired to start your own adventure. Receive a postcard (remember those?) from the journey and one of my favourite inspiring quotes. Guaranteed to cheer you up on a random February or March afternoon! </p>
<p><strong>£25 - Support Social Enterprise</strong></p>
<p>Here's one to get excited about. The above inspiration, plus a unique gift picked out just for you.  Where possible, it will be from one of the social enterprises visited, and will include the story of how this gift for you is making the world a better place. Think cool T-shirt, hand made scarf, or local jewellery.. </p>
<p><strong>£100 - Learn How To Do It</strong></p>
<p>All the above, plus I'll help you design your own Inspiring Adventure. Whether you want a day out in London, or a trip around the the world, we'll create a plan through skype and email.  I'll answer your questions, and connect you with the right people to make it happen.</p>

<p><strong>TACKOBOX POLETAP SMARTROD</strong> is the<em> <strong>Worlds First And Only</strong></em> <em>Computerized Fishing Pole! </em>It will let you know if you get a bite by way of a light and sound alert or light only alert. It's so smart it will automatically turn off the alert as you reel in the fish so as not to interfere with your fishing experience. The <em>SMARTROD</em> also has a digital readout for High Med or Low sensitivity settings. The H M L display will flash green every 12 seconds to let you know what sensitivity setting you are in as well as letting you know the rod is on and searching for activity from your fish. When in the designing stages of our rod simplicity of use was a priority. All operations of functions are from a one-button concept. To turn it on simply push the button and pick which sensitivity setting you desire. As an example of our technology when in High sensitivity setting you can just lightly touch the tip and it will go off yet still be able to hold the rod and walk around without setting off the alert. You can use Medium and Low settings for wind, waves, trolling, heavy rain or fishing in current. If you are fishing in rain  it's no problem,<em> POLETAP SMARTROD</em> is water resistant. This is the world’s first and only programmable fishing rod using <strong><em>Computer Controlled Accelerometer Technology</em></strong> protected by way of our full utility patent, design patent as well as software copyrights and trademarks. <em><strong>These rods would be a great gift for any angler in your family or fisherman using multiple rods</strong></em>. It is the ideal choice for catfish, striper and other freshwater and saltwater game fish. This technology is also perfectly in line with european carp fishermen being that the alarm is built into the rod with no need to purchse any extra accessories or attachments. It also works well for fishermen with disabilities. We want people who are visual or hearing impaired to know fishing is a sport that is available to them. Enjoying fresh air and the great outdoors is a treasured American pastime. Outdoor activities can help improve mental, spiritual and physical wellness. It is an important part of maintaining our quality of life</p>

<p><strong>Design </strong></p>
<p>We took a simplistic approach to every aspect of this project. We wanted the product to have a sleek blended look to closely match the visual of a typical rod yet still give the feeling that there is something else there. From the programming of software to the one button design we were always focused on high technology through ease of use. Even the button is designed so it cannot be activated in error while fighting your fish. Our design is actually quite complicated if you consider the amount of space available for components and assembly along with the need for it to be water resistant. I feel we have succeeded in creating a product that has technology yet it is simple to use and easy to understand. </p>
<p><strong>Sounds</strong> </p>
<p>The sounds the <em><strong>SMARTROD</strong></em> makes are also very important to us. We tested many different speakers, volumes and tones. We wanted to be sure our product produced quality sounds in the way of professional devices like sonar or even medical equipment. We did not want it to sound like a typical buzzer or video game. Each function needed to have its own unique sound.  The output alarm volume had to be audible at a great distance and still have the ability to alert with light only. Our technology is intelligent and the sounds it makes should be as such.</p>

<h1>History:</h1>
<p>My wife currently sells Mary Kay. The whole reason she wants to do this is so she can help support the family financially while more importantly, raising our kids. This story is written across all of the companies just like Mary Kay. Independent Sales Consultants become independent sales consultants so they still feel they are supporting financially as well as raising the children. Of course there is a lot of money to be made if you are really good at team building and sales. After watching my wife go through her routines, I noticed a problem. Everything was ON PAPER! She would have piles of client cards and invoices. Customers would call and she would sift through all of it to find that customer. She never knew for sure if she had something in stock. I would always be mapping locations and addresses and trying to help her find her way... I found spending time with the family, was just not there. She spent all this time with her business and missed out on the fundamental reason why she was doing what she was doing in the first place. Spending time with the family</p>
<h1>
<br/>The Solution:</h1>
<p>The solution was simple. She needed an application that could store her clients information in one place and be able to access it at anytime. She needed a way to keep track of all the orders a client had and what products to make re-orders easy. She needed a way to poke people, and remind people she was there to help them with their needs. She needed an easier way to send receipts, keep track of inventory, and know what's selling and what's not. She needed a way to optimize her 4 deliveries for that day instead of driving around town. She needed the 8 apps out there that do this to be in one. Pocket Parties does that! We have developed a way to keep track of all of this in one place.</p>

<br/>Where the money goes:</h1>
<p><strong>Design</strong></p>
<p>Design is important in any app as you want it to flow and be easy on the eyes. Sketching out prototypes and wiping them clean to start all over is just part of the process. We will have a team of designers and focus groups to help us determine if the design is practical for what we are trying to accomplish.</p>
<p><strong>Development</strong></p>
<p>As tricky as development is, it is important to find the right people to make this application. I, myself, cannot do this by myself. As someone that knows  how extensive coding can be, a team of brains is better than one. I have come up with that team and the portfolio is amazing. What we will be able to do will be endless!</p>
<p><strong>Apple</strong></p>
<p>Great design and development is expensive, and Apple and Google will take some of the funds. The App Store and Google Play will be the only means to distribute the app to customers so there is going to be a huge slice off every download. $7,500 is my goal and nearly 10-12% of that will get chopped off the top after we pay the dues here.. So this and Apple, does not leave me a ton of wiggle room, but I can get it done with your help!</p>
<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>
<p>Our left over funds, excess money raised, will help push our app even further as we will utilize ads and other marketing strategies to jump start the application further.</p>

History:
My wife currently sells Mary Kay. The whole reason she wants to do this is so she can help support the family financially while more importantly, raising our kids. This story is written across all of the companies just like Mary Kay. Independent Sales Consultants become independent sales consultants so they still feel they are supporting financially as well as raising the children. Of course there is a lot of money to be made if you are really good at team building and sales. After watching my wife go through her routines, I noticed a problem. Everything was ON PAPER! She would have piles of client cards and invoices. Customers would call and she would sift through all of it to find that customer. She never knew for sure if she had something in stock. I would always be mapping locations and addresses and trying to help her find her way... I found spending time with the family, was just not there. She spent all this time with her business and missed out on the fundamental reason why she was doing what she was doing in the first place. Spending time with the family

The Solution:
The solution was simple. She needed an application that could store her clients information in one place and be able to access it at anytime. She needed a way to keep track of all the orders a client had and what products to make re-orders easy. She needed a way to poke people, and remind people she was there to help them with their needs. She needed an easier way to send receipts, keep track of inventory, and know what's selling and what's not. She needed a way to optimize her 4 deliveries for that day instead of driving around town. She needed the 8 apps out there that do this to be in one. Pocket Parties does that! We have developed a way to keep track of all of this in one place.

<h3>Fortune Cookie Soap Retail is like no other retail bath + body store. (thank goodness!)</h3>
<p> Our names are Justin and Shannon Prokop, we are the owners of Fortune Cookie Soap.</p>
<p> After making and selling soap for 7 years, both online and wholesale, we realized, now is time to take it to the next level. <em>FCS GOES RETAIL</em>!!!! For those of you that know us, you know you don't have to worry about this being, your average retail soap shop. (Granny's Soap Shoppe *cough cough*) </p>
<p> We plan on making our store a futuristic type reflection of our current social media pages. Kinda like social media - <em>IN ACTION!!</em> Very interactive and hands on. Social media is HUGE for us, and the reason we are where we are. We have a rabidly loyal online community, affectionately dubbed ""Fortunefreaks"", that are coming along for the wild ride. </p>
<p> You might be thinking to yourself, ""Why should I donate, I don't even live in Tulsa."" Good point! Our online Fortunefreaks are going to be a HUUUGE part of our retail store...</p>
<ol>
<li> We will have a store webcam that we will turn on periodically, for all those voyeurs out there that like to watch. (We know you're out there!)</li>
<li>Large flat panels displaying our different social media platforms that we are active on. Our local customers will be able to check in, share pictures and get advice from our online community, effectively growing our community until we take over the world. ;) </li>
<li>There will be a graffiti wall for customers to sign. ""______ was here!""</li>
<li>Another large flat panel will be playing all of our Youtube reviews, helping the reviewer gain exposure and aiding the newbies in choosing their products.</li>
</ol>
<p> Our fundraising goal has been set at the minimum level at which we can open this retail location.  A plan dependent on awesome perks, breaking rules, and a general attitude of ""let's just do this, come hell or high water!"" Should we exceed our goal rest assured that the money will go to the other 1,000 things that we didn't foresee.  In the event that we fall short of our goal we will put the funds raised, towards a smaller crappier location. BUT LET""S NOT THINK LIKE THAT!  </p>
<p>The bottom line is, we're opening a retail location and every additional dollar allows us to minimize compromises and maximize awesomeness. So, if you're a new backer contemplating donating, please come aboard. And if you're already a backer, well, hold onto your sparkly FCS shirt, because it's full steam ahead!</p>
<p>Our goal is to open by June 1st. Donations to this campaign will go towards...</p>
<ul>
<li>a retail sign (our first quote was for $10,000-$15,000!!! *faints*)</li>
<li>patching and painting the store</li>
<li>a POS system </li>
<li>store fixtures</li>
<li>a new computer</li>
<li>utility and lease deposits</li>
<li>a checkout counter</li>
<li>building our inventory</li>
<li>flat panels</li>
<li>a commercial sink</li>
<li>employee uniforms</li>
<li>custom wall paper (seriously ROCKS!!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus the 1,000 things that we didn't plan on. Is that it?? Wow, I sure hope so! </p>
<p>How IndieGoGo works: You decide how much you want to donate and choose an associated perk.<span> </span>When our campaign ends, IndieGoGo takes a 4% fee of the money we’ve raised. Roughly $17,670 is the difference. If we don't reach our goal, the fee is 9% (which might not sound like much, but end up being a lot! Another reason why it's important we reach our goal!).<span>  </span>Another 3% or so also goes to IndieGoGo for cc processing fees.<span><span> </span></span>But everything else will go straight to opening the retail store. </p>
<p> If you aren't in a position to support us financially at this time, that's okay! You can still support us by spreading the word about it using the share tools here on IndieGoGo. Ready, set, SHARE!! &lt;3</p>
<p>If you've made it all the way to the end of this long winded post..</p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU!!!</strong> Every little bit helps. Seriously.  </p>
