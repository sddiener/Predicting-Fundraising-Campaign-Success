<h3>Helping Make This Dream A Reality</h3>
<p>When I first began Harper&amp;I I had to ask myself what my main goals were for the studio. Creating a safe haven for dancers and movers from all walks of life was a big goal. A challenging, positive and professional curriculum was also a big one. Something that kept coming to mind was the opportunity for the dancers to travel. Traveling has given me so much perspective as to the kind of individual, artist and mentor I want to be. I want to be able to provide similar opportunities for my dancers and so I made a promise that I would do my absolute best to make a trip to New York City happen. I really hope you can help me keep that promise!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why New York City? We are located in Washington and are lucky to have Seattle close by but New York would be a once in a lifetime opportunity. The professional dance world is right at your fingertips and the chance to take classes with companies like Alvin Ailey and witness a Broadway musical firsthand would just be extraordinary. This trip is meant to inspire Sarah and Eden and instill a confidence in them that they are able to pursue their dream in any way, shape or form that they would like! And I (and you!) will be here to help them along the way. </p>
<p>The opportunity to take the girls to New York City would be an amazing experience. If for some reason this campaign does not meet its full goals, I will do everything in my power to make the trip happen regardless! <br/></p>

<h3>You Will Influence the Fate of Two Dancers!</h3>
<p>Any support you give will directly influence the lives of these two talented dancers! How amazing is that? They will be able to step out of their comfort zone and go to a completely new city, into a completely new studio and discover new aspects of their dancing that they didn't realize before! They will be surrounded by dancers from around the world and will be able to make new friends and connections that will help inspire them even further.</p>

<br/>About the show...</h2>
<p></p>Based on the popular 1988 film, <em>Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</em> centers on two con men living on the French Riviera. Lawrence Jameson makes his lavish living by talking rich ladies out of their money. Freddy Benson more humbly swindles women by waking their compassion with fabricated stories about his grandmother's failing health. After meeting on a train, they attempt to work together only to find that this small French town isn't big enough for the two of them. They agree on a settlement: the first one to extract $50,000 from a young female target, heiress Christine Colgate, wins and the other must leave town. A hilarious battle of cons ensues that will keep audiences laughing, humming and guessing to the end!<p><br/></p>
<p>The creative team has been working really hard to make this production as wonderful as possible. The collaboration is amazing and the process has been going smoothly thus far. To fulfill the vision and dedication of the creative team we now need funding and support from you! Thank you so much for supporting this production and we hope you get a chance to see the show!</p>

<p>Located in the Cottonwood Arts District of eastern downtown Colorado Springs, Cottonwood is a community of more than 90 studio artists. Community growth is fostered through the creation of art, classes and workshops, monthly gallery exhibitions, and special cultural events including our “Day of the Dead” open house. Professional growth is fostered through mentoring, group critiques, and creative leadership.</p>
<p>At Cottonwood, we don’t just create art for ourselves – we use art to elevate our community! Whether it’s using art as rehabilitation for trauma survivors, PTSD patients, and veterans’ groups; offering classes to students from varying socio-economic backgrounds of all ages and skill levels; or partnering with the Adduce foundation to help high school students create and explore the arts, we’re using our power for good, and that's good for business too. In fact, the only way to keep talented younger people in a city is by offering a variety of culture. We want to be THE place people turn to see what's on the cutting edge and what talents might just be lurking within them, undiscovered. </p>

Studio B In Its Current State



 For the past few years, Cottonwood's main focus has been visual arts. Through our partnerships with local organizations like Craft Production Theater, Hear Here, the Colorado Springs Dance Theatre, the Colorado College Summer Music Festival, and Toastmasters we have seen a need for a dedicated performance space in our building.

With hopes to turn this inaugural event into an annual concert, USC Dance has chosen a select few of its alumni choreographers to present their work in this concert, including 2012 graduate (and recipient of the USC Dance Director’s Award) Caitlin McCormack.  

Caitlin has been recognized for her creative approach to choreography and staging not only during her tenure as a USC student, with four pieces presented in USC Dance concerts, but also since her graduation in regional festivals, showcases, and performing companies, including Dance Canvas (Atlanta, GA) and Dance Augusta (Augusta, GA).

Our Story
On February 19th, 1942, President Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which authorized the removal and relocation of all Japanese Americans from the West Coast. Thousands of families, like George Takei's, were forced from their homes and sent, sometimes hundreds of miles away, to live in barricaded camps behind walls of barbed wire.

It seeks to shine a bright light on such a dark chapter of America's history.

</p><p><b>Flamenco Latino Mission</b></p>
<p>We were founded  to
explore and expand the <i>Ida y Vuelta</i>
or “Round Trip” genre of Flamenco dance. This genre reflects an influence of Afro Hispanic
movement, rhythm and melody on Spanish dance and music during the 18<sup>th</sup>
century. This process continues in contemporary flamenco, and Flamenco Latino’s
perspective brings a unique brand to the art form. Over 35 years, the mission has evolved to include instruction in all aspects of traditional flamenco, as well as providing students with a pathway from the classroom to the stage.</p>
<p><b>Flamenco Latino Programming</b></p>
<p>Our programming includes flamenco dance, guitar and
cante instruction to adults and children year-round, outreach programs to underserved communities, workshops with guest artists from Spain, and on-site concerts and recitals. Very few NYC dance studios permit flamenco, so we are home to other independent artists who
rent down time in our studios.</p>
<p><b>Preserving Our Unique Space</b></p>
<p>Since acquiring our
Midtown West space in 2006, we have transformed it for dual use as a dance studio and theater. Since 2014, our space cost has
represented 65% of the annual budget, requiring a large focus on studio rentals
to cover expenses. Many studio rentals have not been for flamenco, limiting us in developing
more mission-based income and support.</p>
<p>During the Fall of 2015, a studio
rental client using 18 hours/week left unexpectedly, leaving us $25,000 short in the annual budget,
or about $2,500 per month. In a way, this was a push for us to start developing
more mission-based income and support, but it will take us at least 6 months to make headway.</p>
<p>We have applied for grants to expand
our programming, and develop alliances and partnerships during 2016. If we can
supplement about half of the lost income through this funding campaign,
we can eventually become more self-sufficient.</p>
<p><b>What We're
Asking and How It Will Be Used</b></p>
<p>The $6,000
funding will provide for 50% of the lost studio rental income for 5 months
from Jan. 15-June 15, 2016 (about $1,200 per month). Over this term, it will help to pay about 10-20% of the following expenses:</p>
<p>$1,000, Artistic Director Aurora Reyes' salary.</p><p>$1,000, Music Director Basilio Georges' salary.</p>
<p>$3,600, rent.</p><p>$230, electricity and phones.</p><p>$70, maintenance.</p><p>$100, liability insurance.</p>
<p><b>Perks</b></p>
<p>Flamenco Latino
has set 9 levels of donation values, along with perks ranging from mp3 downloads, discounts on group classes, discounts on upcoming Dec. and June concert
tickets, copies of two different CDs, and attendance at an exclusive Meet
the Artists Reception for “Flamenco Gumbo II,” taking place in late July 2016.</p>
<p><b>If the Funding
Goal Is Not Reached, Then What?</b></p>
<p>If the full
goal is not reached, any portion raised will be applied to the same needs. Flamenco
Latino’s lease runs through July 2018. The Board is strategizing a plan for
self-sufficiency in the present space. Funds raised by this campaign will allow
the planning process to take place with less financial stress. If Flamenco
Latino did not undertake this campaign, it would have to consider leaving the
space before the lease is up.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Our annual budget is $162,000. We are small and lean. A successful campaign will increase
our total donation level by 40%, and strengthen our financial profile when we
apply for future grants. Being able to show a healthy percentage of donation
income on grant applications is a huge plus for showing organizational stability.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">This is a call to action, for your generous support which will aid Jocelyn Tan and Neo Jialing, two Singapore-based, independent artists towards co-producing and presenting a new, original collaborative work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We’ve had the wonderful honour of being selected and invited by <i>MOTUS Danza Compagnia</i> for a 10-day residency programme for young creatives, in Siena, Italy, as part of the company’s bi-annual <i>Move Off Spring Dance Festival 2019.</i> As relatively young artists, this marks our first collaborative, overseas residency opportunity, which will culminate in a premiere of our new original creation on an international platform.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Having first met at and graduated from <i>LASALLE College of The Arts</i>, both Jocelyn and Jialing have been consistently keen on creating multi-disciplinary, exploratory works together. As a collective, we’ve had the chance to create and perform together for the past 3 years on different platforms, taking the chance to experiment and explore on our genuine curiosity of the potentialities of what we believe music and movement can extend to. Working together, there was always a indescribable workflow where we both felt challenged and pushed by the other to expand (and expend) on our personal limitations of our own artistic disciplines.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Therefore, with this residency in mind, we decided to take the next big leap on our collaborative journey, and use this as a chance to further push the boundaries of own artistic capabilities. Both of us intend to spend these few months leading up to the residency - in addition to the actual residency itself - developing a working methodology across music and movement that would aid in our own practice as artists, and also efficiently generate artistic material that truly encapsulates the stories and ideas that we want to share.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In short:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544776537/qgfyqspgkezzbloyztgp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With the notion of “what is most personal is most universal” <i>(Carl R. Rogers, On Becoming A Person</i>) -- we will attempt, through this new work-in-progress, to harness a deep personal impetus and eventually create a raw yet distinctively challenging piece where the elements of music and movement co-exist in a symbiotic relationship. Ultimately, we hope to elicit a visceral response from audiences, and inspire retrospection.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT IS THE RESIDENCY ABOUT?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Offered by <i>MOTUS Danza Compagnia</i>, this residency is an opportunity for us to spend 10 days in Siena, Italy, to workshop and further develop our work-in-progress under the mentorship of Simona Cieri, artistic director of<i> MOTUS</i>. The residency will eventually culminate in the premiere of our work in the <i>Castelnuovo Berardenga Theatre (Teatro Alfieri).</i> Through this opportunity, we hope to bring greater awareness to Singaporean multi-disciplinary work, as well as make a statement about how independent and relatively small-scale collectives are able to make a huge creative impact as well!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Why do we need so much?</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO US, AND TO YOU?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">As independent artists, we firmly believe in continually pushing ourselves to generate work that is both fulfilling with regards to our personal growth and artistic integrity, as well as to provoke emotional and visceral responses to art.

We have been doing theatre in Houston for a short time, but we have all come from a background of performance, art, and storytelling. We are excited to bring the story of Delilah front and center on the stage straight from the page. </p><p>As people who populate this earth, there are many times we feel silenced as people as if someone else has taken the liberty to tell our story for us. It is this exact thing that happens to Delilah. Her story is told in the bible by a writer who is not her, and whose primary focus is on that of her husband, Samson, leaving much to be speculated about what happened to Delilah. Here in the pages of Lock by Lock Delilah finds her voice, and finds a way to have her say and tell her story the way she knows it. This story of love, strength, and redemption tells an important message: through the telling of this story we want you to know that there are always many sides to every story, and your perspective on your story is always important and invaluable. </p><p>By helping us launch the Lock by Lock project, you help ensure the telling of an important and profound story about faith, hope, and love.

It is a retelling of the biblical story Samson and Delilah from Delilah’s point of view, thus giving Delilah a voice she doesn’t have in the Old Testament. Delilah tells her story in the past tense, giving the reader the sense that she is telling her story on the day of judgment. The story has never been staged until now. This show is extremely important to the people on our team for many reasons, and this project has made a huge impact on our lives already. We are all passionate people who are all connected by our passion for telling unique stories. Here are some quotes from the members of the team on why this project is so important: </p><p>“ As a kid, I was always fairly shy and I didn’t speak very often. At least, I never felt like I spoke all that much--not in such a way that people heard me or listened. For this reason, I have always been drawn to stories about the disenfranchised and the silenced. Projects like these are the reason I went into theatre. I found my voice in performing and storytelling, and it is why I want so badly to give a voice to those who don’t have one. This project tells the story of a silenced woman who refuses to be silent any longer, and I find that absolutely inspiring.” - Teresa Stranahan, Director and Producer </p><p> </p><p>“I went through a period of writing where all I seemed to do was make Biblical women sass people, and while all the one-woman shows I started writing during that period eventually got absorbed into other projects, it feels like Lock by Lock is getting back to its roots by going onstage.  I have a complex relationship with my faith and the Catholic church’s approach to women, and the chance to take back Delilah’s story from those who read it as hating women, hating foreigners, or devaluing human connection as a distraction from devotion to God was too good to pass up. Once I started the work, however, I became all the more frustrated with those limited, hateful readings of the story.  The story is even more remarkable through Delilah’s eyes, without turning Samson into the “real” villain of the piece like some Disney remake. Now I forever see this Bible story as proof that our hate and intolerance keeps us from seeing the true beauty at the core of our world.” - Katy Mulvaney, Writer of Lock by Lock</p><p>“It’s never been a secret that written history is not a collaborative project. The story of Samson and Delilah is functionally a history for major religions across continents, written with only Samson’s journey in mind. Theatre is the ultimate collaborative project - a bond is created with the creative team, the actors, and the audience, and we all get to participate in the journey of the story each performance. I am glad we get to give a voice to functional voiceless, to collaborate in our history this time.” - Victoria Hidalgo, Stage manager</p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Putting on a show is not easy work. Ther are many moving parts and many people that have to be taken into account. Primarily, getting people in the door to see this show will be our greatest obstacle. Second is collecting the funds, part of the solution being this campaign. </p><p><strong>Ticket Sales</strong>- Getting people in the door will be the most difficult part of our job. We plan to put our show on every free event calendar that caters to the Houston area, build relationships with independent writers and bloggers, head an excellent social media campaign, and partner with local businesses and other theaters and other grassroots creatives to get the word out about our show. Should we have 1 or 100 audience members, we will still deliver quality performance and profound storytelling. </p><p><strong>Money is tight</strong>- Our group consists of a professional actor, a teacher, a sales clerk, a paralegal, and a barista. We are all fairly young and not making enough money to have disposable income in investing in projects like these. This provides us a very small amount of buffer should this campaign not be as successful as we hope. However, we do not despair. We are resourceful. We plan to tackle the possibility of a lack of funds with innovation. Props can be made, costumes sourced from our connections, and people found. We are tenacious and eager. These things count for a lot. Plus, there is a small gathering of funds that have been set aside should anything drastic occur throughout this process. We hope to not have to use it, but should the occasion arise, we will do what needs to be done. </p><p>Our team has worked in Houston together for a short time, however, we have all had projects we have done on our own be it art gallery shows, developing cosplay characters, publishing books, or staging other shows. We have accomplished great things on our own, and we are excited to see what we can accomplish together. </p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>Because we are all in the business we are in, we completely understand that it is not always possible to financially contribute to a project like this one. If you find yourself drawn to this project and wish to make a meaningful contribution, there are many things you could do to make sure this show becomes a success: </p><p> </p><p><strong>Share this Page</strong>- Word of mouth is invaluable in crowdfunding campaigns, and this show could use all the help it can get.

We have been doing theatre in Houston for a short time, but we have all come from a background of performance, art, and storytelling. We are excited to bring the story of Delilah front and center on the stage straight from the page. As people who populate this earth, there are many times we feel silenced as people as if someone else has taken the liberty to tell our story for us. It is this exact thing that happens to Delilah. Her story is told in the bible by a writer who is not her, and whose primary focus is on that of her husband, Samson, leaving much to be speculated about what happened to Delilah. Here in the pages of Lock by Lock Delilah finds her voice, and finds a way to have her say and tell her story the way she knows it.

<li>to create powerful theatre that explores challenging themes</li>
<li>to provide sustainable employment for both established and emerging artists</li>
<li>to develop new audiences within the North West.</li>

<p> </p>
<p>Gillian is a freelance director and head of an acting course at The Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA). She has worked for ATG and the National Student Theatre Company and has directed in various theatres across the UK. Her production of <em>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</em> for Lodestar Theatre Company, in 2010, won two Daily Post Awards.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Australian actor, Samantha graduated from LIPA in 2011. In training, she performed in numerous productions including <em>Loyal Women</em>, <em>The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe</em>, <em>Sweeney Todd</em> and <em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em>.

<h3><strong>what we’ve done before</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In June 2012, we produced our premier production, <em>bash: latter day plays</em> by Neil LaBute, at the Unity Theatre to a fantastic response. It was a small scale production with a minimal design concept that really allowed LaBute’s terse and tense text to come to the fore. The production was hailed as a production that  “pulls you in and keeps you in a state of quiet contemplation long after you’ve made your way home.” (The Public Reviews)</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>the project</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>In collaboration with Unity Theatre, Liverpool, we’re staging a production of <em>When the Rain Stops Falling</em> by Andrew Bovell in June 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is an epic play, spanning eight decades, four generations and two hemispheres – two hemispheres that could not be further apart, not only geographically but also in their nature. The claustrophobia of London juxtaposed with the vast expanse of the Australian Desert; from the stifling heat of Alice Springs to the cold damp of London’s streets, from 1959 to 2039, from the extraordinary summit of Uluru to the ordinariness of a grimy London flat, we follow Gabriel Law as he retraces the paths of his ancestors, on a journey to piece together the jigsaw puzzle of his own identity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>why this play?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re really passionate about this play! As company founders we have a strong interest in its geographical roots, a love of two countries and two cultures, one of us from each (Britain and Australia). But really, it’s the universality of this story that excites and touches us most of all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s a story of family and the struggles we face as descendants of a clan. It explores our ability to accept and to forgive the imperfections of our loved ones, an unconditional tie, and a bond that cannot be broken. And what are the consequences when we cannot accept and we cannot forgive?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The play looks at our histories, how our identities are shaped by events in our past, how these events play into our future. The question is, do we have a choice? Do we have the freedom to forge our own path or are we held ransom by the decisions and mistakes of our ancestors? And what happens when pieces of our past disappear, when people go missing and we lose a sense of self? Can we be whole without our history in tact?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The play also deals with subject matter that is often considered taboo: alcoholism; dementia; abuse and mental illness. It unearths the idea of loneliness in its many guises: how we can feel alone in a crowded city; alone in an intimate relationship; in the maze of our own diminishing mind; at the bottom of a bottle; in a desert town. Loneliness is a state of mind rather than a state of being. It is psychological, less physical.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For us, education and audience development are important parts of our work, so as well as producing this play, we will be providing opportunities for disadvantaged young people and carers of people who suffer from mental illness, to not only see the play but to take part in specially designed workshops with our actors.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>the money</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Where will your money go? If we raise £2000, it will pay salaries for two of our eight actors. Cuts in arts funding means that we have to be more resourceful and tighten our belts. Some companies choose to forgo paying their artists as a result. We shouldn't exploit their daring to live hand to mouth in order to tell the best stories. We shouldn't expect them to 'do it for the love of it'. We should be supporting and nurturing them for they are the future. We are a non-profit organisation who will bring you quality theatre. We are a small company but we will not ask actors, technicians or designers to work for free.</p>
<p> Like the sound of this and want to be part of the big dream?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Support our work by donating. No matter how small or large the amount we raise, it will always go towards paying our artists.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong>what’s in it for you?</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>There are all kinds of goodies and acknowledgements up for grabs if you donate £10 or more to our campaign. See the ‘perks’ section for all the juicy details!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>If you can’t afford it…</strong></h3>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>No worries! We totally get that. We’re starving artists too. If you can’t afford to give but you like the look of us and what we’re doing, please spread the word! Use the Indiegogo share tools and social media sites to tell all your friends! The more people that know about us and our project, the better.</p>

the project
 
In collaboration with Unity Theatre, Liverpool, we’re staging a production of When the Rain Stops Falling by Andrew Bovell in June 2013.
 
This is an epic play, spanning eight decades, four generations and two hemispheres – two hemispheres that could not be further apart, not only geographically but also in their nature.

<p><strong> </strong><strong>About “The King’s Whore”</strong></p>
<p>We are thrilled to be embarking on the journey to bring history alive with our theatrical production of ""The King's Whore: The Anne Boleyn Story."" The play is both compelling and historically accurate, including chunks of actual letters and speeches from Miss Boleyn. It is a modern theatrical re-telling of Anne's story that examines the political, religious, and human conditions that allowed a 16th-century woman trapped in a man’s world to change that world forever.</p>
<p>We have plans to give this sweeping story life with lavish and accurate period costumes, set in a high-quality off-off-broadway house (Walkerspace is officially booked!) under the AEA showcase code, and with skilled professional actors and top-notch direction.</p>
<p>Your contributions are what will make this project reach its full potential. We have already raised almost $15,000 in personal contributions, but need this additional $10,000 to finally bring this project to life.</p>

<p><em>         -Antonin Artaud</em></p>
<p>The impressive feats of Olympic strength and skill are rivaled only by the arresting feats of the soul arising from the most daring acting. I am drawn to creating shared theatrical experiences that lead both audience and artists on a cathartic and ephemeral emotional journey together. Bravery, open-mindedness, and honesty from both parties are required to achieve this.</p>
<p>I choose to give breath and spirit to stories that profoundly move people, challenge deeply-entrenched stereotypes, and contextualize our modern day experience through an understanding of the past. Audiences are drawn to my vivacious energy and layered performances.</p>
<p>Illuminating the Anne Boleyn story for a modern audience was an obvious choice for someone so drawn to both the artistry of theatre and the machinations of politics. This immersive play shows how Anne moves passionately through a man’s world, refusing to bow to the accepted female behavior of the time. In doing this, she alters the course of English history, and even more importantly, of Western religious history as a whole. I have done my job if the audience leaves finding history half as accessible, vital, and compelling as I do.”</p>

<p><strong>Why Do You Need So Much Money?</strong></p>
<p>The short reason is: producing theatre, especially in NYC, is very expensive! This is a very ambitious production that includes 10 actors and authentic Tudor costumes. We want to do this lavish period piece and beautiful story justice! These are just a few of our major expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Theatre Rental: $15,000</li>
<li>Actor and Designer Stipends: $5,000</li>
<li>Period Costumes: $2,000</li>
<li>Rehearsal and Audition Space: $2,000</li>
<li>And much more!</li>
</ul><p><strong>Why This Play?</strong></p>
<p>Anne Boleyn is a fascinating historical figure, as evidenced by the fact that we are still telling her story <em>500 years later</em>. She was the first female commoner to ever be made a noble in her own right, and she rocked a nation by capturing the heart of a man who threw the Pope out of England for her.</p>
<p>Who will love this story besides Anne Boleyn aficionados?</p>
<ul>
<li>Political aficionados will find the story of court politics shockingly similar to the issues of power and manipulation we deal with in the modern U.S.;</li>
<li>British expats and their American descendants will relish in an opportunity to process a crucial part of their cultural history onstage;</li>
<li>Feminists will love this depiction of one of the earliest women to challenge society’s standards for acceptable female behavior;</li>
<li><strong>But most importantly, the play is compelling, engaging, and human enough to hold the interest of all lovers of drama.</strong></li>

<p align=""center""><strong><em>Eve Edwards</em></strong><strong> performs an aria from “Sephro: the Vengeance” </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>(Words and music by <em>Kate Quinn </em>© 2012)</strong></p>
<p>Philadelphia’s 2012 “Fringe Festival” provided the backdrop for the opera’s much anticipated premiere. Sephro: the Vengeance is one of the most innovative and thought-provoking operas of its time.  In concert with the science fiction/fantasy genre, the story centers on the alliance between righteous witches from Earth and the magical inhabitants of planet Sephro.  They join forces to battle a terrible “evil” that finds it roots in the violation of a young maiden. “The Vengeance” and its predecessor, “Sephro” both center on powerful adult themes that illustrate the deleterious effects of abuse while underscoring the healing power of faith, trust, inner strength and wisdom.</p>
<p><strong> Lyrics </strong>(c) 2012, by Kate Quinn:</p>
<p>Lean on me, Darling, and look in my eyes,<br/> You don't have to suffer in this world of lies.<br/> I'm one with you and I'll help you to stand on your own!<br/><br/> I want to give you what no one else dared, <br/> Reason to love you, though they never cared<br/> You are just one of the many who's fled from their home.<br/><br/> But Truth Says, ""I love you, <br/> I'll never leave you”!<br/> Mountains may crumble and oceans may rise!<br/> Winds may run rampant and stir up the fires!<br/> Castles may come crumbling down,<br/> Worlds may collide but there's love by your side,<br/> I am here!""</p>
<p>As a child, the composer/author of <em>Sephro and Sephro: the Vengeance</em> personally experienced the victimization brought to light by this bold and groundbreaking foret into the previously unexplored realm of reality-based fantasy.  The major impetus and inspiration for bringing these works into the public consciousness was to fulfill the composer’s desire to right the wrongs of her youth and to conciliate past conflict with present understanding.</p>

<p>To continue producing the innovative opera and children’s works that have made Fantasy Weavers one of the most “talked about” theater companies in the region, we need your heartfelt participation and support. </p>
<p>Our next children’s production (“Cat Land”) is scheduled for completion in early 2013.  This will not be possible without your help.  Catland is an important allegory about sharing and loving one’s neighbor. It teaches children to care about their fellow human and to share what they have with others who are less fortunate. It is a tale about a land where cats reign supreme and where they are magically blessed with the nine lives that have inspired human wonder and awe for centuries.  Catland is the place that cats go when they dream.  Children will be entranced with the color and beauty of Catland and will learn the essential life lesson that it is far better to compromise than to dominate.</p>
<p>The author created Catland to bring to fore her painful childhood experience with bullying, deprivation and sibling rivalry.  The story leads the audience down the same path that the author took in her desire for vindication and the resolution of early trauma.</p>
<p>Fantasy Weavers is registered by the state of Pennsylvania as an official “not for profit” organization.  All donations are tax deductable.  With your gift, you will be supporting the continued exploration of the unexamined, original themes and stories that define the Fantasy Weavers experience…themes and stories that will expand the minds of Philadelphia audiences and will teach our children about kindness and the true value of the golden rule.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact of Fantasy Weavers on Society as a Whole</strong></p>
<p>Fantasy Weavers was created to expose “at risk” and disadvantaged youth and adults to the enchantment and beauty of the performing arts by offering free or low-cost access to original opera and children’s musical productions…productions with a message. Our shows enrich the lives of these vulnerable members of our community by providing joyous, enlightening entertainment that instructs as well as entertains. In addition to the color and magic that is Fantasy Weavers, our shows provide children with invaluable “life lessons” that support development of the “moral compass” that is required to navigate life’s winding road.</p>
<p>“Becky Butterfly and the Story of the Wayward Wasp” is a musical about healing the wounds that “bullying” can inflict.  The show introduces a male worker wasp named “Kevin” who suffers under the abuse of his peers because of his differences.  The story line demonstrates that differences can be wondrous things.  As the show concludes, the audience learns that diversity must be embraced if there is a desire to evolve and grow as members of a community.  The other wasps learn that they must appreciate the talents and abilities that make us all special no matter how those talents and abilities are packaged. As mentioned above, the message contained in our new children’s musical “Catland” serves as a metaphor for the true meaning of compromise.  Children learn that giving is far better than having and that sharing is at the root of all human experience.</p>
<p>Unique to the Fantasy Weavers’ mission and purpose are adult-themed productions that expose the audience to controversial topics not traditionally explored by live musical performance. By experiencing these topics in the context of musical entertainment, audiences are encouraged to submerge themselves into the sometimes murky reality of the human condition and are provided the opportunity to confront today’s issues with new understanding and deeper insight.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong> Other Ways You Can Help…</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>SPREAD THE WORD!!!</strong></p>
<p>Tell everyone you know about Fantasy Weavers’ mission to share the beauty and excitement of live theater and opera! Encourage them to give abundantly!  We exist only because of your generosity and the generosity of our loyal contributors but we cannot make it without the support of community.  As a famous lady once said,<strong> “it takes a village!”</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>SPECIAL OFFERS!</strong></p>
<p>Also, please check out the perks offered on the right of this page.  For just a small donation, you will be provided the wondrous opportunity to journey through space and time to be swallowed up into an alternate reality…a reality where aliens and witches travel the void to save their world and to embrace the journey of their souls.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>GET INVOLVED!</strong></p>
<p>If you would like to volunteer your time by working with the stage crew or in another capacity to help us bring Fantasy Weavers’ next show to fruition, please contact Kate Quinn at 610.389.9572.  We truly appreciate your participation and desire to support Fantasy Weavers and its mission.</p>

To continue producing the innovative opera and children’s works that have made Fantasy Weavers one of the most “talked about” theater companies in the region, we need your heartfelt participation and support. 
Our next children’s production (“Cat Land”) is scheduled for completion in early 2013.  This will not be possible without your help.  Catland is an important allegory about sharing and loving one’s neighbor. It teaches children to care about their fellow human and to share what they have with others who are less fortunate. It is a tale about a land where cats reign supreme and where they are magically blessed with the nine lives that have inspired human wonder and awe for centuries.  Catland is the place that cats go when they dream.  Children will be entranced with the color and beauty of Catland and will learn the essential life lesson that it is far better to compromise than to dominate.
The author created Catland to bring to fore her painful childhood experience with bullying, deprivation and sibling rivalry.  The story leads the audience down the same path that the author took in her desire for vindication and the resolution of early trauma.
Fantasy Weavers is registered by the state of Pennsylvania as an official “not for profit” organization.  All donations are tax deductable.  With your gift, you will be supporting the continued exploration of the unexamined, original themes and stories that define the Fantasy Weavers experience…themes and stories that will expand the minds of Philadelphia audiences and will teach our children about kindness and the true value of the golden rule.
The Impact of Fantasy Weavers on Society as a Whole
Fantasy Weavers was created to expose “at risk” and disadvantaged youth and adults to the enchantment and beauty of the performing arts by offering free or low-cost access to original opera and children’s musical productions…productions with a message. Our shows enrich the lives of these vulnerable members of our community by providing joyous, enlightening entertainment that instructs as well as entertains. In addition to the color and magic that is Fantasy Weavers, our shows provide children with invaluable “life lessons” that support development of the “moral compass” that is required to navigate life’s winding road.
“Becky Butterfly and the Story of the Wayward Wasp” is a musical about healing the wounds that “bullying” can inflict.  The show introduces a male worker wasp named “Kevin” who suffers under the abuse of his peers because of his differences.  The story line demonstrates that differences can be wondrous things.  As the show concludes, the audience learns that diversity must be embraced if there is a desire to evolve and grow as members of a community.  The other wasps learn that they must appreciate the talents and abilities that make us all special no matter how those talents and abilities are packaged. As mentioned above, the message contained in our new children’s musical “Catland” serves as a metaphor for the true meaning of compromise.  Children learn that giving is far better than having and that sharing is at the root of all human experience.
Unique to the Fantasy Weavers’ mission and purpose are adult-themed productions that expose the audience to controversial topics not traditionally explored by live musical performance. By experiencing these topics in the context of musical entertainment, audiences are encouraged to submerge themselves into the sometimes murky reality of the human condition and are provided the opportunity to confront today’s issues with new understanding and deeper insight.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In 2011, two playwrights-- Gahl Pratt Pardes and Emily Talia Sztabzyb-- listened to the stories of women from Calgary, Canada who had survived violence in their relationships with husbands, boyfriends, children, grandchildren, and caretakers. Their stories inspired a play that is at once gritty in its capturing of the frightening reality of abuse (a reality faced by 1 in 3 women in North America), and surreal and captivating as it explores the complex inner lives of the women who leave, and the women who stay. </p>
<p>Gahl and Emily are producing a professional, Equity staged reading of this play, scheduled for <strong>7:00pm</strong> on <strong>June 4, 2012</strong> at the <strong>Cardel Theatre in Calgary</strong>. Ticket sales will go directly to fund Na'amat, which is an organization that aids and empowers women and children. Many of Calgary's most celebrated actors have already participated in development workshops for this play, and have pledged interest in participating in a production. We are trying to raise the funds to pay the actors, a director, a stage manager, a musical composer, and a low-tech designer to produce a polished, well-staged reading for this play.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is our hope that by staging a captivating production of this play, and subsequently giving further life to this project in Calgary and beyond, these difficult and beautiful stories can be told, and that the vital conversation around this issue is ignited. Additionally, along with 100% of the ticket sales, a large portion of the money we are raising will go directly to Na'amat, which runs projects and programs that empower women and children internationally.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $7,000 to adequately pay the actors, director, stage manager, and honourariums for other artists involved. This sum would allow us to produce a show with a week's rehearsal and fairly polished production values.</p>
<p>We need about $1,000 for materials (simple furniture set pieces, lighting and sound equipment).</p>
<p>We are trying to raise an additional $2,000 to go directly to Na'amat, along with 100% of the ticket sales, sponsorships, and program ad sales.</p>
<p>This is a fundraising challenge, and in the event that we do not raise all of the above-mentioned funds, we would be able to produce a bare-bones production, or unstaged reading. We believe the impact of the piece would be much greater, and the message much more accessible to a wider audience if the production were to be well-polished. That's where you come in!</p>
<p>By donating to this endeavour, you help spread the message that domestic violence is a social issue that affects us all, and you help spark interest in the community, while providing vital funds to an organization that helps victims.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether or not you are able to donate ""green energy"" to this campaign, spreading the word is another awesome way you can help! Share this link with your e-mail, Facebook, or blog contacts, and see if you can show 5 people this page. Thank you so much!</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $3,250 to provide 50 full scholarships to our 6th Annual Pasadena Dance Festival for students age 12-18 who wouldn’t otherwise be able to attend due to financial circumstances. Scholarships will be distributed in partnership with Pasadena Unified School District, Pasadena Education Network, local dance studios and community organizations.

<p><strong>What’s the Impact?</strong></p>
<p>Even though “Dancing with the Stars” and ""So You Think You Can Dance"" has brought dance into many homes, the cost of dance instruction and dance attendance is still far out of reach for many.

Students will have the opportunity to experience a wide variety of dance classes from Ballet to African to Bollywood and more. They will also attend various performances from professional dance companies, student groups and emerging choreographers. </p>
<p>Every year, Lineage Dance aggressively pursues opportunities to make the festival as accessible as possible, and for the past four years, Lineage has offered tickets and scholarships at no cost to the community.  The opportunity to experience dance live dance can be a life-changing experience. We have seen the transformative power of this event.  From a few previous scholarship students:</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Hi my name is Edgar Ramos and I enjoyed going to the Pasadena Dance Festival.   It was great and I enjoyed all the dances that I got to see and the ones to try.   I met some really cool people, but what it meant to me, going through a scholarship…well it was ok, I just wish I could have paid for it myself. I’ve also learned that there are all sorts of unique styles of dance &amp; expressions that go as they flow through the body &amp; mind.   They paint a picture in my mind &amp; a story that goes with every dance and emotion.  Overall, it was fantastic to have seen all of that and well thank you for everything and for also making a great event thank you all.</em>  – Edgar Ramos</p>

<p>I'm <a href=""http://www.justinmclachlan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Justin McLachlan</a>, and I'm the creator of Sight. It's based on a short story I wrote <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13297460-red"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Red"">for an anthology</a> by an indie scifi and fantasy publisher I cofounded in DC. The story is called 'Superhero' and it's about a guy who becomes a street-prowling, crime fighting vigilante. Why? Well, he knows when he's going to die—he has a second sight—which means he also knows when he's not going to die. Sight picks up where the short story left off.</p>
<p>In 2012, I received a small grant from the city of DC to write Sight, eight 15-minute episodes in all, and present them as a stage reading with DC actors. We're just wrapping that up as we launch this campaign because, we hope, with your help, we'll actually get to produce the full first season.</p>

<li>While shooting digital means we don't need to buy film or pay for processing, we do need a place to store all our footage. Shooting at film resolution means we're talking totals in the double-digit Terabyte range to store all of Sight's footage through post-production.</li>
<li>Legal costs include script and title reports that some of our insurance carries will require. We have to make sure we have licenses in place for any third-party content that might end up in the show.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we reach our goal, the budget is going to be tight. And what if we don't reach our goal? We'll produce as many episodes of the first season as we can, even if that's just the pilot. </p>

<h2>The Show...</h2>
<p> 'Little Drops of Poison' is a dance-based theater piece, set in the dark world of Tom Waits. The show follows Bud - <span><span class=""fsl""><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJD27y8Q3AhE&amp;h=WAQGplJZH&amp;s=1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>https://www.youtube.com/</span>watch?v=JD27y8Q3AhE</a>  </span></span>as he stumbles his way through Waits' world of dancers, looking for his lost love. </p>
<p>The show will feature some of Boston's finest dancers, as well as actor/musicians from around the country.  </p>
<p><span><span class=""fsl""> </span></span></p>
<h2><strong>How it started...</strong></h2>
<p>The idea for the show came about in September 2012. It started from my discovering blues dancing and exploring Tom Waits’ music at around the same time. To me, if Waits’ voice could dance, I believe it would do so like these dancers, in this style. A subtle, slow-dragging jook joint dance, with deep American roots, and full of improvised feel.. Once I saw it, I was desperately curious to see what these dancers would do if put in Waits’ world.</p>
<p>This idea also came during early autumn in New England, where I live. I remember Waits’ once describing a lot of his music as ‘Halloween music’. We saw the show thriving in that setting, so we chose Waits’ songs of that nature and tone, – some of his darker, scarier, yet fun and theatrical material. Feeling it’s potential as a theater piece, and a story growing, this evolved into the inclusion of Chad Hauge (Chicago based actor) and his clown character ‘Bud’.</p>
<p>6 months later, the show has grow into this wonderfully strange mix of theater, dance, music, clowning and story.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where it's going...</h2>
<p>The show has grown in strange and wonderful ways. We are very excited to debute this idea and share the experience with you! Though this first inception of the show is happening on March 30th, we hope this will just be the beginning. The shows intended setting is Halloween, particularly in New England. Come fall, we will be restaging the show in a range of different spaces and venues, specific to this show and the time of year. We hope to let the show thrive and be enjoyed by those who won't get a chance to see it the first time around.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>How your support will help...</h2>
</div>
<div>Your generosity and financial support will be going directly to three things: The artists, the space and Tom Waits himself</div>
<p>THE ARTISTS: The talent we've been lucky enough to bring together for this show is staggering. renowned dancers, actors, musicians, designers, and the list goes ever on. Their skills are worth paying for. </p>
<p>THE SPACE: We're very excited to be putting on this show at the Julie Ince Thompson Theatre in Cambridge, MA. Not only is the theater ideal for dancers, but it's age and feel give it a wonderful character; perfect for a show exploring the world of Waits.</p>
<p>TOM WAITS: We were again very lucky to be given grand rights approval from Mr. Waits and his record label, to use his material exclusively. This is a rare occurance that an artist will grant this type of permission and we are honored to be able to create and riff off of his genius work. A percentage of the donations and box office will go to him and his co-writer, Kathleen Brennan.</p>

<p>My name
is Terry Hatfield. I have been working as a Butoh artist for 24 years. I
founded the Butoh Co-Op Thailand in 2005. I have produced 8 International Butoh
Festivals in Bangkok, Thailand with the help of B-Floor Theatre, Crescent Moon Theatre, and Democrazy Studio. I am currently seeking support to produce, BUTOH
FEVER: THE 9<sup>th</sup> INTERNATIONAL BUTOH FESTIVAL THAILAND 2014. I have invested my life
savings on producing this annual event. Since 2005, the Festival has grown
beyond my means; therefore, I am seeking other means of funding this project
which is very close to me. Plus with the current coup d’état in Thailand, it
makes it difficult to get local support. Most of our support comes from
tourists. This year’s Festival is sponsored in part by the Bangkok Arts and
Culture Centre (BACC) as part of their Performative Art Festival #3.  BACC has given us space to work, perform, and
exhibit. Your contribution would help to pay for technician fees, equipment
rentals, partial artist fees, and accommodation fees for international artists.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We need
a total of $3,940 to meet our budget items. $1,500 covers technician fees and
equipment rentals. $1,240 covers accommodation fees for international artists,
$800 covers partial artist fees, and $400 covers catering cost during the
rehearsal process.</p>
<p>Anyone who supports will receive their name in the program under different levels of support (see perks for descriptions). Contributors
will receive their name in the program and performance tickets,  Sponsors will receive  VIP passes to all events and their logo will appear in all
publicity, media, and promotion materials connected with the festival and are
permitted a booth at all events to promote their product.</p>
<p>All
funds raised will go directly to the festival. If we do not make our goal, the
festival will continue. Your help and support guarantees expenses will be met.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Past Festivals have included artists from Japan, Thailand, Viet Nam, China, Sweden, United States, Columbia, Canada, Hungary, Finland, Greece, Spain, France, Australia, Israel, Netherlands, Latvia, Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Mexico, Brazil, and Italy. The objectives of the project are to:  1) Educate the public about the Butoh art form in an international format. 2) Showcase works by Thai, Japanese, and International artists. 3) Create an international Butoh community and network of artists. 4) Encourage a cultural exchange relating to Butoh and Butoh influenced work. BUTOH FEVER: THE 9th INTERNATIONAL BUTOH FESTIVAL THAILAND 2014 will provide Butoh dance workshops, Butoh performances, and photo exhibition with installation hosted by B-Floor Theatre and Butoh Co-Op Thailand. B-Floor Theatre and Butoh Co-Op Thailand will host up to six international Butoh artists to collaborate with Thai artists.</p>
<p>BUTOH FEVER: THE 9th INTERNATIONAL BUTOH FESTIVAL THAILAND 2014 will take place in the capital of Thailand, Bangkok, December 4-21, 2014. The featured artists for this year’s event are Takita Takayuki (Japan),  B-Floor Theatre (Thailand), Salome Nieto (Mexico / Canada) of pataSola Dance supported in part by the British Columbia Arts Council, Butoh Co-Op Thailand, Valeria Geremia (Italy) of Sicula Butoh, Valentin Tszin of PoemaTheatre (Russia),  and Paul Ibey (Canada) featuring Butoh performances and workshops. Exhibition and installation by Boaz Zippor (Israel), Tawit Keitprapai (Thailand), and Stephen Funke (Finland). Also featuring
a Butoh symposium, Film Screening: “Rite of Passage” by Juliette Yu-Ming (France/Malaysia) and
Solstice Butoh Jam featuring all artists with guest musicians.</p>
<p>Why Butoh Fever, you may ask. There is a saying in Japanese, ""If you sit on a rock long enough it will get hot."" This is the 9th festival and it is steadily getting hotter. Also, in Japanese culture the word for the number 9 is similar to the sound for the word that  means ""pain"" or ""distress"". Butoh artist and Thailand's Butoh pioneer, Katsura Kan has often likened Butoh as an illness that once infected, people's lives change. In other Asian cultures, the number 9 symbolizes completion of the three realms of existence; Mind, Body, and Spirit. Butoh
is currently being practiced as a healing therapy as well. Butoh Fever may be
your cure or your disease.</p>
<p>Your contribution helps Thai artists get exposure from outside of Thailand. Many Thai artists have gone on to work internationally in the USA, Korea, Japan, Denmark, UK, Germany, and Italy as of a result of connections they made during the Festival. Any support you can offer is a blessing for future events.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>50% of our audience are tourists that just happen upon the exhibition and come back to view the performances. 25% of our audiences are expats living in Thailand and the other 25% of our audience are Thai artists working in the performing arts. Currently Thailand is under a coup d’état and will not have a new government in place until September 2015. Therefore, embassies have been discouraging people from taking their vacations in Thailand. If tourism is down we would potentially lose half of our audience which helps us to cover our expenses. Therefore, I am asking for your help and support. Also, we are applying for a grant from the Japan Foundation in Bangkok and seeking local sponsors. B-Floor Theatre and Ray of Light Productions are main contributors with some in kind donations from Democrazy Studio.

My name
is Terry Hatfield. I have been working as a Butoh artist for 24 years. I
founded the Butoh Co-Op Thailand in 2005. I have produced 8 International Butoh
Festivals in Bangkok, Thailand with the help of B-Floor Theatre, Crescent Moon Theatre, and Democrazy Studio. I am currently seeking support to produce, BUTOH
FEVER: THE 9th INTERNATIONAL BUTOH FESTIVAL THAILAND 2014. I have invested my life
savings on producing this annual event. Since 2005, the Festival has grown
beyond my means; therefore, I am seeking other means of funding this project
which is very close to me. Plus with the current coup d’état in Thailand, it
makes it difficult to get local support. Most of our support comes from
tourists. This year’s Festival is sponsored in part by the Bangkok Arts and
Culture Centre (BACC) as part of their Performative Art Festival #3.  BACC has given us space to work, perform, and
exhibit. Your contribution would help to pay for technician fees, equipment
rentals, partial artist fees, and accommodation fees for international artists.
   What We Need & What You Get 
We need
a total of $3,940 to meet our budget items. $1,500 covers technician fees and
equipment rentals. $1,240 covers accommodation fees for international artists,
$800 covers partial artist fees, and $400 covers catering cost during the
rehearsal process.
Anyone who supports will receive their name in the program under different levels of support (see perks for descriptions). Contributors
will receive their name in the program and performance tickets,  Sponsors will receive  VIP passes to all events and their logo will appear in all
publicity, media, and promotion materials connected with the festival and are
permitted a booth at all events to promote their product.
All
funds raised will go directly to the festival. If we do not make our goal, the
festival will continue. Your help and support guarantees expenses will be met.

is a mixed-media performance created as a composition of moments – snapshots
into the life and thought of French philosopher, activist, and mystic, Simone
Weil (1909 – 1943.)  Two
performers, a man playing an actor preparing to interpret Simone Weil, and a
woman embodying Weil herself as per the actor’s invocation, meet in this
full-length production. Through the actor’s meditations, the piece also
reflects on the mystical and artistic processes, and the indispensable role of
“the other” in the construction of meaning.</span><br/>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>Conceived almost as a live
poem, <i>Prologue</i> draws on a multitude
of languages (historical, biographical, allegorical, philosophical…) and
mediums (theatre, dance, visual arts, video projections, music) to create a
stimulating experience for the audience, both at a sensorial and intellectual
levels.</p>
<p>Simone Weil, described by
Albert Camus as “the only great spirit of our times” and by Susan Sontag as
“one of the most uncompromising and troubling witnesses to the modern travail
of the spirit.”  Weil’s empathy for
the suffering of others, especially for the socially oppressed, would lead her
into an active political life. She marched with the working class, confronted
Trotsky, fought in the Spanish Civil War, participated in the French Resistance,
and, sacrificing her privileged condition, she took a job in a factory in order
to fully understand the reality of the proletariat. But even more unusual for a
leftist intellectual of her time, after having a mystical experience, Weil
increasingly focused her thought on religion and mysticism. Weil died at the
age of 34, in exile in London, of tuberculosis possibly exacerbated by her
refusal to eat more than the rations she thought were available to the people
in occupied France.  </p>
<p>There is room for contradiction
and controversy in Weil’s world, and <i>Prologue</i>
does not try to resolve it; rather, it stays with her words and her laborious
commitment to being, above anything else, attentive. For Weil, the capacity to
pay attention is something very rare - almost a miracle, - and capable of
reawakening the souls of those whom violence has turned into stone.  The piece intends to transpire the
vulnerability and beauty that result from such a state of attentiveness. </p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to check
out our campaign to help fund our production of <b><i>The Whale</i></b> by
<b>Samuel D. Hunter</b>.</p>
<p>We’re <b>Melissa Livingston-Weaver</b>
and <b>Shanon Weaver</b>, Co-Artistic Directors of the Austin, TX-based theatre
company <b><i>a chick &amp; a dude productions</i></b><i>.</i> We’re
celebrating our 11<sup>th</sup> season in Austin with this magnificent story by
one of the hottest young playwrights in America! </p>
<p><b><i>The Whale </i></b>tells the story of Charlie, a
600-pound man in Northern Idaho. Charlie was once married, with a
daughter—Ellie—who he loved very much. But that all changed when Charlie met
Alan. Alan was a Mormon, the son of a Bishop. They couldn’t stand to be apart.
Charlie &amp; Alan fell in love, Charlie left his wife &amp; daughter, and Alan
left the church. Some years later, Alan’s father forced him to go to church
just one last time. Alan agreed, and came back…changed. Alan gave up on life,
and died soon after. Charlie began eating his way to his own grave, with the
enabling assistance of his caretaker, Liz. This week, Charlie wants to mend
fences. He wants to reconnect with his daughter—who is now quite the terror. A
Mormon on his mission, Elder Thomas, arrives in Charlie’s life, and may be able
to shed some light on exactly what happened to Alan at the old Mormon Church
over by the U-Haul. Charlie knows he’s not long for this world, and will use
his last week on earth to make sure he’s done just one thing right with his
life. <i>The Whale</i> is a play about love, empathy, family…and much, much
more. We’re very excited to bring this <b>Off-Broadway</b> smash to Austin for
its <b>Texas premiere</b>!</p>
<p>As you know, funding for the arts is
limited and hard to come by. In reaching our campaign goal, we’ll ensure our
entire design and artistic team are paid what they’re worth for the amazing
talents they provide. We’ve raised about 2/3 of what we need for a successful
run, and we hope you see fit to help us reach our goal!</p>

the following:</p>

Thanks for taking the time to check
out our campaign to help fund our production of The Whale by
Samuel D. Hunter.
We’re Melissa Livingston-Weaver
and Shanon Weaver, Co-Artistic Directors of the Austin, TX-based theatre
company a chick & a dude productions. We’re
celebrating our 11th season in Austin with this magnificent story by
one of the hottest young playwrights in America! 
The Whale tells the story of Charlie, a
600-pound man in Northern Idaho. Charlie was once married, with a
daughter—Ellie—who he loved very much. But that all changed when Charlie met
Alan. Alan was a Mormon, the son of a Bishop. They couldn’t stand to be apart.
Charlie & Alan fell in love, Charlie left his wife & daughter, and Alan
left the church. Some years later, Alan’s father forced him to go to church
just one last time. Alan agreed, and came back…changed. Alan gave up on life,
and died soon after. Charlie began eating his way to his own grave, with the
enabling assistance of his caretaker, Liz. This week, Charlie wants to mend
fences. He wants to reconnect with his daughter—who is now quite the terror. A
Mormon on his mission, Elder Thomas, arrives in Charlie’s life, and may be able
to shed some light on exactly what happened to Alan at the old Mormon Church
over by the U-Haul. Charlie knows he’s not long for this world, and will use
his last week on earth to make sure he’s done just one thing right with his
life. The Whale is a play about love, empathy, family…and much, much
more. We’re very excited to bring this Off-Broadway smash to Austin for
its Texas premiere!
As you know, funding for the arts is
limited and hard to come by. In reaching our campaign goal, we’ll ensure our
entire design and artistic team are paid what they’re worth for the amazing
talents they provide. We’ve raised about 2/3 of what we need for a successful
run, and we hope you see fit to help us reach our goal!
Your donation today helps us pay for
the following:
·  Licensing Rights for The
Whale
·  Actor fee x4
·  Set Designer fee
·  Set Construction costs
·  Lighting Designer fee
·  Lighting equipment rental
·  Master Electrician fee
·  Costume Design fee
·  “Fat Suit” construction
·  Costumes
·  Props
·  Sound Design Fee
·  Sound equipment rental
·  Graphic Designer fee
·  Poster & Program
printing
·  Advertising/Marketing costs
·  Light & Sound Board
Operator
·  Concessions
·  Venue rental costs
The director, production manager,
and actor playing Charlie are all donating their time and receiving no pay, in
order to have more to spread around everyone else.
As you can see, there’s plenty to
pay for! All of this comes out to around $12,000, and we’ve got around
$8,000 so far thanks to the City of Austin, private donors, and previous
fundraising efforts. If we don’t make the goal, we’ll stretch what we do make
as far as we can!
We know times are tight. We know
high-dollar donations aren’t an option for everyone. That’s why we’re setting
our increments rather low! We’re operating under the idea that if we can get a
lot of people to give a little, we’ll reach our goal faster than asking a few
people to give a lot. 
We’ve got some great rewards, too!

I have been dancing since I was three and I can't imagine my life without it. I live with my wonderful parents, who are always there for me and support me in everything I do. I currently dance at the BalletMet Dance Academy. Part of a dancer's development is having the opportunity to learn from new teachers in a fresh and challenging environment. Participating in a summer intensive provides dancers with this opportunity. I've dedicated the past thirteen years of my life to dance and I finally realize that my goal is to become a professional jazz/contemporary dancer and performer. I know that trying to make it in the dance world is difficult and is certainly no small task. That is why I ask for your support in helping my goal become a reality, by attending the Joffrey Jazz and Contemporary Summer Intensive in New York City, this summer, from July 28 through August 15, 2014. I attended a competitive audition in Cincinnati in early January to be considered for the program and found out two weeks later that I was accepted. I was thrilled. Attending this program in the heart of New York City has always been a dream of mine as a dancer. I plan to continue my dance training at BalletMet for my senior year of high school, and then go on to study dance and acting in college in preparation for my career. I look forward to sharing this exciting journey with all of my family, friends and sponsors. I will be sure to update you all frequently as my journey progresses. I would appreciate any donations that you are willing to make to help me get to Joffrey NYC this summer. Thank you for your help and consideration in sending me on my way. </span><br/>

But the art is like no other, and one major art form that is in serious risk of disappearing in this great city is performing arts. Usually dancers have to travel outside of the city, and even the state to showcase their unique talents. And getting paid? Well, that’s rare. We have so much talent right here in our backyard, and we want to expose our community to this treasure, and also give our extremely awesome talent pool a chance to perform and get paid to do it. What’s just as important about this project is that there are droves of children who have a deep, overwhelming passion for performing arts, and they too, need a place and an opportunity to feed their creative abilities and to pursue a life in the arts. So proceeds from every performance and anything remaining after the show is paid for will benefit their new, state-of-the-art dance studio being built in the historic neighborhood of Treme (yes, the neighborhood-turned HBO Show).</p>
<p>New Orleans Dance Collective, founded by Janet Andrews, is a 501(c)3 non-profit youth organization (your support is tax-deductible) that actively links dance with social work and seeks to address the overwhelming need for positive, life-affirming, esteem-building cultural activities for inner-city at-risk youth in post-Katrina New Orleans. As you can imagine, most local resources were completey diminished and depleted following what was probably the worst natural disaster in the last 50 years in America. But, we’re done crying about it. Moving on and rebuilding what was once a hub for every art form imaginable is the goal. The Arts-On Fire focuses on all art forms, in hopes to create spectacular events that give the talent of our great country a place to expose their abilities to a diverse audience. It’s also a way to help them earn a living for what they are good at, their special gifts. This campaign will help these local performing artists, and help to groom the performers of the future, through Mrs. Andrew’s dance studio. The kids will be able to work with a professional choreographer, professional dancers, and more importantly, in front of audiences who care about New Orleans and who are hungry to see a show that combines jazz, ballet, burlesque, lyrical dance, aerial and fire, circus arts and theatre all into one. There’s no better place for a show like this.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who’s interested in this great campaign. As we continue to grow and provide other opportunities for artists and children to flourish in the world of arts, we hope you will grow with us too. Until the next big thing, we cannot say enough how excited we are for your support. From The Arts-On Fire family to yours, thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for stopping by at our fundraising page for <em>STANDBYS</em> by Alex Riad, which will be part of the Thespis Theater Festival in New York on August 13th, 16th, and 18th! We have created this page because... well... we need your help to get this project off the ground (some of the play takes place on a plane, so that's funny). All proceeds from the fundraiser go directly to production costs like stipends for the artists, rehearsal space, sets, etc... Please, be an angel and support indie theatre. It takes the power of many to make a vision come together, and this is what the page is all about. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Open Air Dancers is a group of dancers from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts dedicated to spreading the joy of live dance through improvised performances in public spaces. With our dancing we strive to make modern dance more accessible for everybody, taking the dance out of theaters and integrating it into the parks, colleges, landmarks, and hangouts at which people congregate every day. To make our performances as relevant and interesting for our audiences as possible, we try especially hard to utilize unique aspects of the landscape and sometimes even props to complement our dancing. </p>
<p>The Open Air Dancers will be in Charlotte, NC from May 24 – 31, 2013, sharing our craft wherever we can. Our performances are generally 15 minutes long and include solo and contact improvisation, choreographed solo work, and a short choreographed group section. We intend to photograph and film the majority of our performances. At the end of the summer, we will edit the media into a short film documenting the entire process, from rehearsals to travel to performance and even some dancer interviews. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our main concern is to make sure our dancers and collaborators are well paid for their work. Even though it is our passion to travel and dance for others, dancing in the hot sun for hours a day is hard work and our dancers cannot perform unless they are fed and well rested. Your contributions will go toward giving our dancers their per diem pay, which will cover their food, gas, and lodging expenses during the week of travel. </p>
<p>If we are fortunate enough to surpass our goal, the extra funds will go toward hiring another dancer into our group, as well as upgrading our camera and sound equipment. These will significantly improve the quality of our production, and the additional dancer will offset the risk of injury. We have some fun perks we would love to share with you, so give generously if you can. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As starving college students studying to be starving artists, we understand that not everybody can afford to give money. But there are still other ways you can help us reach our goal! Tell your friends, share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, your blog, or anywhere else you think a generous soul might see it.</p>
<p>We are artists above all and love to collaborate! If you are a Charlotte area artist and would be interested in collaborating with us in any way (trust us, we’re up for a lot), please contact us and let us know. Also, if you are the owner or manager of a site in the Charlotte area where you think site specific dancers would be appreciated, we would love to hear from you.</p>
<h3>More About Us</h3>
<p>The Open Air Dancers is led by Graham Cole and Zoe Warshaw, two students of contemporary dance at the University of North Carolina School of the arts.</p>
<p>A Raleigh, NC native, Graham has been dancing since the age of 6 and has never stopped. Before attending college, Graham trained at North Carolina Dance Theatre in Charlotte, NC, where he was privileged to be a part of NCDT’s Random Acts of Culture outreach program. As a member of this endeavor, funded by the Knight Foundation, Graham gained invaluable experience in improvised public performance. Graham is currently a sophomore at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts, where he has performed in works by Jose Limon, Daniel Gwirtzman, Merce Cunningham, and Brenda Daniels. Graham is also among a select group of UNCSA students who will perform at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. this May as part of a program honoring the accomplishments of Sally Ride. In the rare pockets of time when Graham is not dancing, he enjoys baking, cycling, and listening to stand-up comedy.</p>
<p>Zoe Warshaw was born and raised in New Hampshire. She has had an innate zeal for movement since she was three years old and continues to enjoy all of the opportunities that dance presents. Zoe has trained in ballet, jazz, hip hop, improvisation, acting, and multiple styles of modern dance. Zoe is a high school graduate of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts and a current junior in the school’s Contemporary Dance BFA program. Zoe has had the honor of participating in work’s by Doug Elkins, Jose Limon, Larry Keigwin, Twyla Tharp, and Bill T. Jones. She has also had the privilege of performing in a world premier site specific proformance choreographed by Mark Dendy at the N.C. Museum of Art. Zoe has recently returned from NYC where she and her fellow classmates performed self choreographed solos and a group piece choreographed by Grady Bowman at the Ailey CitiGroup Theater. Zoe is entering her senior year this fall and is extremely excited to delve deep into any possiblities and opportunities that await after graduation.</p>

<h2>HZV: HUMAN TO ZOMBIE VIRUS</h2>
<p>My name is Aaron Anthony Bonilla, the playwright of ""HZV: Human to Zombie Virus"" and this play (not porno) has been a project of passion this last year, but this project is more than just the twisted visions of a playwright connecting the adult industry of the 80's, a love for zombie movies (Romero films are the best) and stories of heart break, broken dreams and egotistical apathy.  This project is a group of collegues and friends that have been giving so much of their time and artistic energy to make this play come to life. Our goal is to open in October of this year, perfect for Halloween. We're not only actors, we're producing HZV as a team.</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCTION TEAM:</strong></p>
<p>Aaron A. Bonilla          Director</p>
<p>Rachel Speth              Stage Manager</p>
<p>Robert Benjamin         Technical Director</p>

<p>Casey Kooyman          Fight chorographer</p>

<p>I would like to give you a little background on me as a performer and explain why this festival is so important.  First of all, I am still fairly new to the burlesque world.  I have only been performing professionally since May 2012.  Since that glorious moment when I first took the stage, I have been invited to perform in five festivals, several large shows in Dallas as well as formed my own bi-monthly show, the Plumb Askew Revue.  These are major accomplishments for someone so new to the community.  To be invited to perform internationally is a dream come true!  Your gift will aid me in fullfilling this dream.</p>
<p>My campaign is simple.  Burlesque dancers do not perform because there is lots of money to be made.  They perform burlesque because they love the art and the joy it brings to their soul.  I am no different.  I do not have a surplus of funds to just throw at this trip.  I can fund some of it and I am hopeful to receive the support of my family, friends and fans to help me with the rest.</p>
<p>Performing in Burlesque Festivals is very important to me.  I am constantly approached after shows by plus size women who confide in me and say how much they wish they could be me and how much they envy my strength and confidence.  I am also proud to say that my performances have inspired several of those same women to embrace their own sexy woman within.  I want to continue doing that!  The more festivals I am able to apply to, get accepted into, and perform in, the more people I can reach and inspire with my art form.   To be able to take this mission overseas is a true gift and I simply cannot wait to motivate the lovely and curvy women of Dublin, Ireland!</p>
<h3>What Your Gift is Funding:</h3>
<p>I am asking for $1375.  This breaks down to:</p>
<p>Round Trip Flight from Dallas to Dublin - $700</p>
<p>Four Nights of Lodging - $315</p>
<p>Five Days of Rental Car - $160</p>
<p>Food and Incidental Allowance - $200</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fees Involved with using this service :</p>
<p>The fees are 4% if goal is met and 9% if goal is not met.  I would like to earn a little over my goal so that the actual money that I end up with is what I need.</p>

theater-influenced approach that makes it a perfect piece to bring to Chicago’s

<p>Adapted
from the beloved fantasy novel <i>Coraline</i>
by Neil Gaiman, this original musical by Stephin Merritt &amp; David Greenspan tells
the story of Coraline Jones, a young girl who has just moved with her parents
into a new flat in an old house. Bored by her colorless surroundings and her
busy parents, she goes exploring and discovers a door unlike any in the house –
a magic door that, when unlocked, reveals<span>

all the grownups have black buttons for eyes. This new world seems to offer all

save her parents and herself. </span></p>
<p>“The
score Stephin Merritt composed is singular,” said <b>Music Director Nick Sula</b>, “It’s composed for three different types

<p>Jeffrey Hall’s background
was as a<span>  dancer, physical theatre
artist, choreographer and exceptionnal athlete who worked with some of Quebecs
most ceative companies including Jean-Pierre Perreault, Carbone 14 and Robert
Lepage, to name but a few. </span></p>
<p>In 2002, a rehearsal
accident changed his life drastically. A 15 ft. fall left him with a severe
back injury. His recovery took several months during which he was often
isolated, alone in his apartment with little to distract him except for the
actvity in his back alley. While watching, he often imagined that the idea and
activities would be an excellent basis for a “Ruelle” inspired show.</p>
<p>With time, Jeff proved the
prognosis of never walking again wrong and, he returned to work as a
Choreographer, Director and occasional performer working with Cirque du Soleil,
Robert Lepage and Siete Communications in South America, amongst many others.
However his dream of creating a RUELLE inspired show never waned.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.jeffhallchoreographer.com/about/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jeffhallchoreographer.com/about/index.html</a></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><u>THE PROJECT</u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally this summer Jeff’s
hope and dream to be able to produce RUELLE will finally be realised. </p>
<p>RUELLE will be presented as
part of the Internationally reknowned Montreal Completement Cirque Festival at
Usine C July 6, 7, 8 and 9th. Supporting Jeff is an extraordinary creative team
with years of experience working on many of the most important productions
coming out of Montreal and Quebec – all of them dedicating their work and time
to the project for free.</p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><span>We have hired
an extraordinary group of </span><span>performers </span><span>who </span><span>are rehearsing, pushing their limits</span> <span>every day; we have the </span><span>basic
scaffolding </span><span>structure of a</span><span> potentially</span><span> impressive set;</span> <span>we
have amazing </span>ideas for <span>acrobatic design that are innovative and unseen</span>; <span>and we have evocative images
created by the 4U2C team</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>But</span> <span>we do not have
the costumes to dress our artists and to show them off
at their full potential; we have the basic set structure but we
need to dress it so that it evokes the setting of a RUELLE; we have a basic acrobatic setup but not the resources to realise all
that the team has imagined; and we will have the images to project but we lack the projectors that will do justice to the images that our designers are creating.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p> The funds raised by this campaign will be used to provide
the “oh so important” missing ingredients for the<span>  production - costumes, set, acrobatic
installations and projectors - necessary to really make Jeff Hall’s vision of a
RUELLE inspired work fully a reality. </span></p>
<p><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Jeffrey Hall est un
danseur, un artiste du théâtre physique, un chorégraphe et un athlète
d’exception qui a travaillé avec les meilleurs créateurs québécois dont
Jean-Pierre Perreault, Carbone 14 et Robert Lepage pour n’en nommer que
quelques-uns. </p>
<p>En 2002, un accident lors
d’une répétition changera la vie de ce créateur prolifique. Une chute de 15
pieds le laisse aux prises avec une blessure sévère au dos.<span>  Sa convalescence dure plusieurs mois et
l’isole dans son appartement ne lui laissant pour toute distraction que
d’observer ce qui se passe dans la ruelle derrière chez lui. C’est pendant
cette période que lui vient l’idée qu’une RUELLE consisterait une excellente
base pour créer un spectacle.</span></p>
<p>Avec le temps, Jeffrey a
fait mentir tous les pronostics qui prédisaient qu’il ne marcherait plus jamais
et il est retourné au travail en tant que chorégraphe, metteur en scène et à
l’occasion comme performer travaillant entre autres avec le Cirque du Soleil,
Robert Lepage et Siete Communication en Amérique du Sud. Toutefois, la création
d’un spectacle inspirée de la vie qui prend place dans une RUELLE ne l’a jamais
laissé.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.jeffhallchoreographer.com/about/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.jeffhallchoreographer.com/about/index.html</span></a></p>
<p><b>LE
PROJET</b></p>
<p>Finalement,
cet été, le rêve de Jeff de lancer la production de RUELLE deviendra réalité.
RUELLE sera présenté les 6, 7, 8 et 9 juillet prochains dans le cadre du
festival de renommée internationale : <b>Montréal
Complètement Cirque. </b>Autour de Jeff s’est réunie une extraordinaire équipe
de créateurs d’expérience qui ont travaillé sur de très nombreux projets parmi
les plus importants à avoir été conçus à Montréal et Québec, et tous ces
créateurs donnent leur temps et leur talent gracieusement à la production de
RUELLE.</p>
<p>Des
interprètes de grands talents sont maintenant en répétition chaque jour; nous
avons les échafaudages qui forment la charpente d’un décor impressionnant; nous
avons les idées pour concevoir des numéros acrobatiques inusités et jamais vus
auparavant;<span>  et nous avons des images
magnifiques et évocatrices crées par l’équipe de 4U2C. </span></p>
<p>Mais
nous n’avons pas encore les costumes qui habilleront nos interprètes et les
mettront en valeur comme ils le méritent; nous avons la structure de la
scénographie mais il nous manque la toile peinte qui évoquera le décor d’une
RUELLE; nous avons la base des installations mais nous n’avons pas les moyens
de réaliser tout ce que l’équipe peut imaginer; nous avons les images mais il
nous manque les projecteurs de qualité qui rendront justice aux images que nos
concepteurs ont créées.</p>
<p>Les
fonds recueillis serviront donc à nous fournir ces éléments si importants à la
production - costumes, décor, installations acrobatiques et projecteurs –
afin que la vision de Jeff Hall d’un spectacle inspiré de l’environnement d’une
RUELLE devienne enfin une réalité.</p><p>

<p></p></div>","INTRODUCTION
Jeffrey Hall’s background
was as a  dancer, physical theatre
artist, choreographer and exceptionnal athlete who worked with some of Quebecs
most ceative companies including Jean-Pierre Perreault, Carbone 14 and Robert
Lepage, to name but a few. 
In 2002, a rehearsal
accident changed his life drastically. A 15 ft. fall left him with a severe
back injury. His recovery took several months during which he was often
isolated, alone in his apartment with little to distract him except for the
actvity in his back alley. While watching, he often imagined that the idea and
activities would be an excellent basis for a “Ruelle” inspired show.
With time, Jeff proved the
prognosis of never walking again wrong and, he returned to work as a
Choreographer, Director and occasional performer working with Cirque du Soleil,
Robert Lepage and Siete Communications in South America, amongst many others.
However his dream of creating a RUELLE inspired show never waned.
http://www.jeffhallchoreographer.com/about/index.html

THE PROJECT

Finally this summer Jeff’s
hope and dream to be able to produce RUELLE will finally be realised. 
RUELLE will be presented as
part of the Internationally reknowned Montreal Completement Cirque Festival at
Usine C July 6, 7, 8 and 9th. Supporting Jeff is an extraordinary creative team
with years of experience working on many of the most important productions
coming out of Montreal and Quebec – all of them dedicating their work and time
to the project for free.

We have hired
an extraordinary group of performers who are rehearsing, pushing their limits every day; we have the basic
scaffolding structure of a potentially impressive set; we
have amazing ideas for acrobatic design that are innovative and unseen; and we have evocative images
created by the 4U2C team

But we do not have
the costumes to dress our artists and to show them off
at their full potential; we have the basic set structure but we
need to dress it so that it evokes the setting of a RUELLE; we have a basic acrobatic setup but not the resources to realise all
that the team has imagined; and we will have the images to project but we lack the projectors that will do justice to the images that our designers are creating.

 The funds raised by this campaign will be used to provide
the “oh so important” missing ingredients for the  production - costumes, set, acrobatic
installations and projectors - necessary to really make Jeff Hall’s vision of a
RUELLE inspired work fully a reality. 
INTRODUCTION

Jeffrey Hall est un
danseur, un artiste du théâtre physique, un chorégraphe et un athlète
d’exception qui a travaillé avec les meilleurs créateurs québécois dont
Jean-Pierre Perreault, Carbone 14 et Robert Lepage pour n’en nommer que
quelques-uns. 
En 2002, un accident lors
d’une répétition changera la vie de ce créateur prolifique. Une chute de 15
pieds le laisse aux prises avec une blessure sévère au dos.  Sa convalescence dure plusieurs mois et
l’isole dans son appartement ne lui laissant pour toute distraction que
d’observer ce qui se passe dans la ruelle derrière chez lui. C’est pendant
cette période que lui vient l’idée qu’une RUELLE consisterait une excellente
base pour créer un spectacle.
Avec le temps, Jeffrey a
fait mentir tous les pronostics qui prédisaient qu’il ne marcherait plus jamais
et il est retourné au travail en tant que chorégraphe, metteur en scène et à
l’occasion comme performer travaillant entre autres avec le Cirque du Soleil,
Robert Lepage et Siete Communication en Amérique du Sud. Toutefois, la création
d’un spectacle inspirée de la vie qui prend place dans une RUELLE ne l’a jamais
laissé.

LE
PROJET
Finalement,
cet été, le rêve de Jeff de lancer la production de RUELLE deviendra réalité.
RUELLE sera présenté les 6, 7, 8 et 9 juillet prochains dans le cadre du
festival de renommée internationale : Montréal
Complètement Cirque. Autour de Jeff s’est réunie une extraordinaire équipe
de créateurs d’expérience qui ont travaillé sur de très nombreux projets parmi
les plus importants à avoir été conçus à Montréal et Québec, et tous ces
créateurs donnent leur temps et leur talent gracieusement à la production de
RUELLE.
Des
interprètes de grands talents sont maintenant en répétition chaque jour; nous
avons les échafaudages qui forment la charpente d’un décor impressionnant; nous
avons les idées pour concevoir des numéros acrobatiques inusités et jamais vus
auparavant;  et nous avons des images
magnifiques et évocatrices crées par l’équipe de 4U2C. 
Mais
nous n’avons pas encore les costumes qui habilleront nos interprètes et les
mettront en valeur comme ils le méritent; nous avons la structure de la
scénographie mais il nous manque la toile peinte qui évoquera le décor d’une
RUELLE; nous avons la base des installations mais nous n’avons pas les moyens
de réaliser tout ce que l’équipe peut imaginer; nous avons les images mais il
nous manque les projecteurs de qualité qui rendront justice aux images que nos
concepteurs ont créées.
Les
fonds recueillis serviront donc à nous fournir ces éléments si importants à la
production - costumes, décor, installations acrobatiques et projecteurs –
afin que la vision de Jeff Hall d’un spectacle inspiré de l’environnement d’une
RUELLE devienne enfin une réalité.

<div>
<p>""Slandered by history. Forgotten as women.""</p>
<p>Rome's final curtain has fallen, yet three women still linger in the wings. Tainted by Emperor Nero's legacy, Agrippina leads the fight against the injustice of history. Forced onto the stage with Octavia and Poppaea, another unwelcome performance is imminent...but scripts can always be rewritten.</p>
<p>Aulos Productions are proud to return to the Buxton and Edinburgh Fringe Festivals 2015. Having had great success with 'First Class' last year, which won the Best New Writing award at the Buxton Fringe, we're very excited to bring 'Women of the Mourning Fields' to you. This time however, we need your help to be able to do that.</p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Last year, we deliberately took our show to the Edinburgh Free Festival as we are an amateur production company with limited financial resources. However, this year spaces were limited and so we were pushed to find a paid venue instead. We're very happy to have signed up with Paradise at the Vault, but this leaves us with extra funds to raise for our budget.</div>
<div>We are looking for:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">£850 to aid us with paying our venue fees</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">£225 to provide our costume manager with good materials for authentic-looking Roman dress</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">£125 to helping us cover a publicity order for both Edinburgh and Buxton.</span></li>
</ul></div> <p>Any additional money raised would go towards helping out the cast and crew with travel and accommodation expenses for our trip to Buxton. In return for your generosity, we can offer you a variety of perks including:</p> <ul> <li>Personalised Latin mottoes (+ crests)</li> <li>Show-branded t-shirts and mugs</li>
<li>Signed copies of the poster and script</li>
<li>Complimentary tickets</li> <li>Our eternal gratitude</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>We are an amateur company and nobody within the cast and crew is getting paid. We do theatre because we love doing it and because of our enthusiasm for the project. However, the costs of Fringe Festivals have soared in recent years and makes participation all the more difficult for independent theatre practitioners.

</div></div>","Short Summary

""Slandered by history. Forgotten as women.""
Rome's final curtain has fallen, yet three women still linger in the wings. Tainted by Emperor Nero's legacy, Agrippina leads the fight against the injustice of history. Forced onto the stage with Octavia and Poppaea, another unwelcome performance is imminent...but scripts can always be rewritten.
Aulos Productions are proud to return to the Buxton and Edinburgh Fringe Festivals 2015. Having had great success with 'First Class' last year, which won the Best New Writing award at the Buxton Fringe, we're very excited to bring 'Women of the Mourning Fields' to you. This time however, we need your help to be able to do that.
   What We Need & What You Get
Last year, we deliberately took our show to the Edinburgh Free Festival as we are an amateur production company with limited financial resources. However, this year spaces were limited and so we were pushed to find a paid venue instead. We're very happy to have signed up with Paradise at the Vault, but this leaves us with extra funds to raise for our budget.
We are looking for:


£850 to aid us with paying our venue fees

£225 to provide our costume manager with good materials for authentic-looking Roman dress
£125 to helping us cover a publicity order for both Edinburgh and Buxton.
 Any additional money raised would go towards helping out the cast and crew with travel and accommodation expenses for our trip to Buxton. In return for your generosity, we can offer you a variety of perks including:  Personalised Latin mottoes (+ crests) Show-branded t-shirts and mugs
Signed copies of the poster and script
Complimentary tickets Our eternal gratitude    The Impact
We are an amateur company and nobody within the cast and crew is getting paid. We do theatre because we love doing it and because of our enthusiasm for the project. However, the costs of Fringe Festivals have soared in recent years and makes participation all the more difficult for independent theatre practitioners. Therefore, even the slightest amount of money donated will soften the personal financial blow that Fringe Festivals often make.
Our recent successes with ""First Class"" (2014) and ""A Winter's Oresteia"" (2015) show the quality of the theatre we can produce if we're enabled to do so. By donating money to WMF, you will be ensuring that the stories of these Roman women are finally heard by the wider world and not left at the sidelines of history once more.

<p>Happy Fall to Everyone!  </p>
<p>This Campaign is geared towards raising funds for the 2016 Philadelphia Youth Dance Fest Master Classes offered to all participating students!  </p>
<p>This upcoming festival will take place at The Arts Bank at the University of the Arts on March 5 &amp; 6, 2016 and will include 15-20 pre-professional dance companies from Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.  Last festival included over 200 participating students!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition to the performances, three Master Classes will be offered to the students held at The University of the Arts.  Each year, different classes are given to culturally enhance and broaden the education of young pre-professional dancers. </p>
<p>For the 2016 festival, each student has the opportunity to take classes in:</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><i>Franklin Method Contemporary</i> <i>Technique </i>with Shannon Murphy</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><i>Eclectifunk</i> with Charles Tyson Jr. </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><i>Flamenco Dance</i> with Elba Hevia y Vaca </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The classes are a great way to build community and interact with peers from other studios! </span></p>
<p>Two of the classes will also offer live musicians!  </p>
<p><b>We are raising funds to pay for these wonderful professional teachers and their musicians to come and teach at our festival.  They will each be teaching three classes each and enhancing the dance knowledge and exposure to approximately 200 students!</b></p>
<p>PYDF hires Philadelphia based teachers, building a relationship with the younger generation of dancers. All of the teachers are connected with a Professional Company and/or College exposing the young dancers to the professional world of PhillyDance. This, in turn, creates support on a professional level and builds a younger generation of audience members for the dance community.<br/></p>
<p>PYDF was founded in 2014 after realizing that there was a surplus of individual pre-professional dance companies, but nothing to unite them all in one place that was not competition oriented. It is stressed that this is not a competition. <br/></p>
<p>The mission of the Philadelphia Youth Dance Fest (PYDF) is to provide young and aspiring dancers an experience that will enrich and inspire their craft through the celebration and performance of dance. It is an occasion that will allow them an opportunity to learn from their peers, unite through dance, and gain a sense of community.  We hope to provide a true feeling of accomplishment that they, in turn, can apply to all their futures in the world of dance and in their lives.  </p>
<p>Please consider giving a donation to provide these wonderful classes for young and aspiring dancers.  Any amount helps and is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Please share this campaign with anyone that you feel would be willing to support this cause.  </p>

Exit</i>?</b></h3>
<p>For those of use who
want to produce ""Capital-G"" Good Art, it is easy to be seduced by pathos. Lee woke up one morning and realized that it had been upwards of 4 years
since she'd done a play that didn't involve the deaths of children,
inappropriate sexual relationships, genocide, or generally an excess
of despair. </p>
<p>It was time for a
Farce. </p>
<p><b>No, really, why <i>No Exit</i>?</b></p>
<p>We realize that Sartre
isn't necessarily the first playwright you go to for a farce and for a project originally pitched to all parties as ""I-need-to-do-a-comedy-please-do-a-comedy-with-me"" <i>No Exit</i> isn't the obvious choice.  </p>
<p>Nor was it the first that was considered. After <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, Stringberg's <i>Dance of Death </i>and <i>Everyman </i>were nixed as ""definitely not comedies,"" it seemed clear this might be the closest we could get. </p>
<p>Maybe we're a
little comedy-challenged. But we are ready to stretch ourselves. We'll make
this play funny or die trying. </p>
<p>Don't think that the
humor is contrived. With 70 years of distance its easier to see the absurdism
in the characters and their predicament. Add some energy and physical comedy --
which let's face it, this play has always needed that -- and presto: comedy! </p>
<p>Our goal is to not to
mock Sartre. His ideas and anxieties haven't become irrelevant. We hope to use farce to breathe a little space into a play that often feels inaccessible and
claustrophobic. </p>
<p><b>Why all women? </b></p>
<p>Why not. </p>
<p>Don't think for a
minute that there isn't a deeply reasoned artist reason for this choice, but you are
just going to have to see the show to find out. Suffice it to say many a
Shakespeare play has been cast with all men on less consideration. Now it's our
turn. </p><h3>What exactly Am I Funding? </h3><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-weight: normal; background-color: initial;"">This project is the very definition of a shoestring operation.

<h3>Dear Family,<br/>UNIVERSES just celebrated 21 years of doing this here thing it is we do, and we've loved every moment of it. We do things the way our people taught us to do, unapologetically, adding some of our own brand of secret sauce along the way; theater, music, movement, politics ... always in the DNA. It's not an easy journey, when you don't always conform to creating American Theater by the rule books; but we keep pushing, believing it can continue to evolve. </h3>

<h3>Camp Str8-N-Arrow Needs YOU!</h3>
<p>Savage Umbrella invites YOU to bring <i>Ex-Gays: Not a Str8 Remount</i> to life. </p>
<p>Set in fictional Camp Str8-N-Arrow, <i>Ex-Gays: Not a Str8 Remount</i> follows Pastor Brian and the rest of the camp staff as they help campers turn off their homosexual feelings and turn on their love of the heterosexual life. Through the lens of satire, Savage Umbrella takes a humorous and thoughtful look at the devastating effects of homophobia and religious zealotry. It's camp. It's satire. It's a camp satire.<br/><br/>Critic Adam Whisner said of the original 2011 production, <i><strong>“The show was wonderful. Hilarious, campy, silly, full of improv and scripted moments, but also packed a punch, revealing the devastating emotional consequences of this kind of thinking and the damage it can do to people who are duped by misguided religious zealotry. It's a solid, well-produced and executed piece of sociopolitical art. I absolutely recommend it.”​</strong></i></p>

<h3>About Savage Umbrella</h3>
<p>Savage Umbrella - a queer-led, Twin Cities-based theater company - creates new works striving to engage artists and audiences in critical conversation. With lust for the uncharted and the unknown; we embrace and dissect the familiar. As we celebrate our 10th anniversary, we've turned our focus even more sharply towards female- and queer-centered stories. We believe that theater is a vehicle for important and complex conversations about who we are, how we are, and how we connect with each other. <strong>Together is better. Get under the umbrella.</strong></p>

<h3>Why We Need EX-GAYS</h3>
<p><i>Ex-Gays: Not a Str8 Remount</i> is a goofy, zany ride that examines some actually very serious, scary, and <strong>real</strong> stuff. Conversion therapy (sometimes known as ""reparative therapy"" or ""pray-the-gay-away"") is not a myth; it is a controversial, pseudoscientific, and <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/realities-of-conversion-therapy_us_582b6cf2e4b01d8a014aea66"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">devastating</a> form of psychotherapy that attempts to change a person's sexual orientation from gay to straight.</p>
<p>The American Psychiatric Association opposes this treatment and considers it harmful and unethical. Yet, in 2011, it came to light that Marcus Bachmann - husband of presidential hopeful Michelle Bachmann - ran a Christian counseling clinic (right here in Minnesota) that <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/michele-bachmanns-husband-my-clinic-does-gay-to-straight-therapy-but-its-not-our-agenda/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">engaged in these misguided practices</a>. Marcus Bachmann even referred to members of the LGBTQ+ community as <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/michele-bachmanns-husband-shares-her-strong-conservative-values/2011/06/21/gIQAyNmvzH_story.html?utm_term=.bd36217a35c1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""barbarians"" that ""need to be educated.""</a> Dr. Robert Spitzer, one of the most prominent advocates for conversion therapy, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/health/dr-robert-l-spitzer-noted-psychiatrist-apologizes-for-study-on-gay-cure.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">actually apologized for his actions and the damage they inflicted in 2012</a>.</p>
<p>Although we have made some incredible strides over the past few years (such as with the Marriage Amendment), rates of suicide are still <a href=""http://www.thetrevorproject.org/pages/facts-about-suicide"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">four times greater</a> for LGBTQ+ youth and nearly 50% of trans people have considered suicide at some point in their lives. Now, in 2017, we are faced with an Administration that is vocally anti-LGTBQ+ (including the recent <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/politics/trump-military-transgender/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">military bans</a> of trans people) and consistently devalues our bodies, contributions, and relationships. Conversion therapy is not fiction, or something that has happened in the past. <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2017/03/21/conversion-therapy-is-torture-lgbt-survivors-are-fighting-to-ban-pray-the-gay-away-camps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">It is happening right now, and it is not okay.</a></p>
<p>Through <i>Ex-Gays: Not a Str8 Remount</i>, Savage Umbrella seeks to shed light on this important conversation by embracing laughter, illuminating absurdity, and celebrating the contributions of LGBTQ+ artists. Plus, we could all just use a laugh every once in a while, right?</p>

For over two decades, PlayGround has been a leading playwright incubator,
providing unique opportunities for the cultivation and development of
early-career local playwrights and partnerships with leading professional
directors, actors, theatres and theatre lovers. Over that time, PlayGround has
developed more than 750 original short plays by 200 Bay Area playwrights and
premiered 134 of these as part of the Best of PlayGround series. PlayGround has also commissioned 61 new full-length plays (many adapted from the Best of PlayGround shorts) and supported the premiere of 20 of these at theatres in the Bay Area and across the country.<br/></p>
<p>Through the development of original
short (and now full-length) plays, PlayGround creates a microcosm of the
greater theatre scene, supporting emerging playwrights' experimentation and
risk-taking, while helping them hone their style and technique.</p>

<h3>Who the heck are we?</h3>
<p>We are Malachi Reid and Jonnie Grant, two recent graduates from Edinburgh Napier University with dreams of working in the theatre industry. Malachi is an actor, singer and the writer/director of the show. Jonnie is a musician and the composer/musical director of the show. We bonded as friends after doing shows together for years and then bonded as creative partners when Malachi realised Jonnie was stupid enough <i>not</i> to run away when he suggested a Tenacious D musical. Speaking of... </p>
<h3>What the heck is The Musical Of Destiny?</h3>
<p>The Musical of Destiny is a passion project started by Malachi back in 2013. He has been a fan of Tenacious D since first hearing Tribute and has always had a passion for musical theatre. So after re-watching the 2006 movie The Pick of Destiny he thought why not combine the two. However after a few stumbling blocks (Including a water damaged notebook and laptop motherboard setting itself on fire) the project was shelved. Then in 2017 Malachi brought the idea up to Jonnie and he said he was in. The show was alive once more!<br/><br/>So the show itself is a reinterpretation of the story of Tenacious D forming as a band, and journeying to become rock legends as they search for the pick of destiny! Using elements from all their current studio albums and the original film. With new characters and live music this is not just a simple retelling, it is a new live theatre addition to the legacy of the D!</p>
<h3>Why the heck are you here?</h3>
<p>We're here on IndieGoGo because this isn't a small project that we want to do just for the concept alone. We want to make this show come to life. We are only able to do this show once and we want to build a show that no one would believe could happen and many might not believe could be possible. But not only that we want to reach out to the fans of Tenacious D and new musical theatre and ask for their help, because we believe that a project like this is made for fans, by fans and can be made even better by fans! And hopefully that's you.</p>
<h2>OUR CAMPAIGN! </h2>
</div><div>
<h3>What the heck we need!</h3>
<p>So, now to the least fun part of new theatre...money.<br/>As we said above, we are recent university graduates so money isn't in a great abundance for us to put on this show. Saying that we are not doing this for profit, that's not why we are asking for money. We are asking for money so that this show can be as good as possible for you the backers and fans! However to do that we need to cover some base costs.<br/><br/>Our goal of £2300 is based on the cost of venue hire and fringe registration fees. Once that is covered then all our money goes straight into the show.<br/><br/>Reaching our goal would mean we could start to upgrade the shows costumes, props, set and any extra things that could help grow the experience for the audience</p>
<p>Saying this our goal is flexible, which means that even if we don't reach or full goal all money will still go to us. This money would <i>still​ </i>go towards helping with venue cost and fringe fees. Our goal is to get this show to the fringe and to you! And we will do that even if we have to do it in minimal costume and with cardboard props!</p>
<h3>What the heck you get!</h3>
<p>So what do you get for contributing to the show?<br/>Well besides our undying love and thanks, plus the satisfaction of helping a plucky young group of musicians. You will get various pieces of show memorabilia and personal connections to the show.</p>
<ul>
<li>With all perks you will receive a personal thank you on our social media page for everyone one to see, but more importantly you well be added to our official backers page when we publish the script. We believe that if you donated, even on the lowest tier, you deserve to be ingrained into the history of this show.</li>
<li>On certain tiers you will receive exclusive show merchandise. This includes show posters, badges and T-shirts. This way you will always have a piece of show to remember us by. Plus it'll be the ultimate talking piece at parties.</li>
<li>We have also included with certain perks a ticket to the show itself at that this years Edinburgh Fringe (2018). If you helped contribute that amount of money then we want you to come to our show so you can see what you helped create! Plus you will get the best seats in the house, reserved especially for our backers</li>
<li>Since this is kind of a ridiculous show we have also included two ridiculous perks. The ""DIO"" tier and the ""BEELZEBOSS"" tier. These are there to one, show that we will go that extra mile to make our contributors feel like the awesome people they are for donating money. And two it's a funny addition to our naming scheme.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why the heck should you care?</h3>
<p>Here's where we get emotional. We understand that there are hundreds of projects out there and even more people that deserve this money more than we do. But by donating to this show you're not just helping us put on a show...</p>
<p>You are helping grow the arts industry. You are helping create jobs for young actors, singers, musicians, stage crew, techies, promoters and more. You are helping show the current art community that new young creators CAN make and produce theatre that people want to see if they just have a lil' financial support. You are helping emerging artist show their talents and skills at one of the biggest arts festivals in the world. You are showing that the musical theatre scene in Scotland is hungry and ready to create some new exciting theatre if you give us the chance...</p>
<p>And on a personal level. You are helping make two young men's dream come true. You are helping them see that they can achieve anything with hard work and some help from good people.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES!</h2>
<h3>What the heck have we got to do?</h3>
<p>So now we're gonna let you peek behind the curtain of what risks and challenges come from a show like this and how we know you can trust us to overcome them!</p>
<ol>
<li>Challenge: Creating a new play is very difficult, and a new musical adds the caveat of well...music. Plus we are only getting one shot at it. No do overs or retakes.<br/>Solution: Malachi graduated with a degree in Acting for Stage and Screen, a course in which he had to write, direct and workshop new writing regularly; and Jonnie graduated with a degree in Music with composition has his main form of study. Making new theatre is their bread and butter! They're use to pulling things off with only one shot.</li>
<li>Challenge: The Fringe is one of the biggest arts festivals in the world with over 53,232 performances of 3,398 shows in 300 venues (stats from 2017). Which means performing isn't the only job. You have to promote and market your show, or it could be left in the dust.<br/>Solution: Both Malachi and Jonnie have been performing at the fringe for the past 6 years. So they know what the Fringe is like from personal experience. Not only that but they have been part of a range of shows with different companies, so they have experience working in various environments. They have also been apart of new writing before, so know what it's like to hit the pavement and sell, sell, SELL a new show. With all this knowledge and experience they will be able to handle anything the fringe can throw at them!</li>
<li>Challenge: Creating a show based on an already established bands music means that you not only have an obligation to make the show good in general, but you have an obligation to the music and the fans.<br/>Solution: WE LOVE MUSIC. Malachi and Jonnie are both huge music fans and have many years of experience in performing music. Not only will they be able to make sure that the original spirit of the music and what made it so engaging for fans before will be upheld. They will be able to boost, highlight and showcase these traits even more!</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarize, we have the ability and drive to win the race. We just need your help to get to the starting line.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP!</h2>
<h3>What the heck else can you do?</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute financially (we totally understand) or wanna help us even more (you rock!) then you can please share our campaign, like us on facebook, follow us on twitter or just tell your friends about us! </p>

<h3>Hi! We're Tiny Box Theater: Sarah, Justin and Joy</h3>
<p>Last century, we became friends in a black box theater at Drew University. Fast forward to 2015 when Joy was spring cleaning and suggested that two mailboxes from a past installation become small stages for a new project. Sarah coined the company’s name. Justin revealed the magic of magnets. We all took out our scissors and glue guns. And <a href=""https://www.tinyboxtheater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tiny Box Theater</a> was born.</p>
<p>(Shout out to fellow Drew alum, Aaron Smith, for designing our logo!)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532270608/sofqjoh6pwygzfrec5dv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>We make theater out of the box inside of a box.</h3>
<p>Tiny Box Theater pieces are for tiny audiences, just one or a few at a time, for just a few minutes each. The boxes are portable, repurposed, and interactive. Original storytelling invites the audience to get close and find themselves part of the piece. </p>
<p><strong><i>The experience for both audience and performer is one that pushes us to reimagine what stories look and sound like, and to find theatricality in small moments.</i></strong></p>
<p>Since 2015, we've annually presented Tiny Box Theater pieces at the Figment Festival on Governors Island to <a href=""https://www.tinyboxtheater.com/gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">joyous audiences</a>...so we decided to go big by going on an international tour!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>4 Cities. 3 Countries.<br/>NYC. Boston. Edinburgh. Toronto.</h3>
<p>This summer, we're performing our two newest pieces, THE CURIOSITY SHOP<i> </i>and SEED MONEY<i> </i>in outdoor public spaces during festivals. We'll perform over ten different days for several continuous hours each day. We've been working with friendly and enthusiastic curators in each city.<br/><br/>We're not paid to perform and all of our performances are free, but we can pass the hat for donations in Edinburgh (and hopefully earn a few pounds for chips and a pint at the end of the night). </p>
<h3>What We Need. How You Can Help.</h3>
<p>We're incredibly grateful for donations of any size. Some amounts come with crafty perks. Please note donations are not tax-deductible.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our $5,000 goal will help us cover the cost of transportation, housing for 2-3 artists per city as well as the materials that go into designing each of the Tiny Box experiences.</li>
<li>Sarah received a Don Quixote Fellowship from the Academy for Teachers, which will help cover her housing and travel in Edinburgh. This means that our $5,000 campaign goal will fully cover all remaining expenses.</li>
<li>While each of us aren't able to perform in every city, we will be joined by guest collaborators. As two people work the boxes, the third works the line.</li>
<li>Once we meet our expenses, any additional funds will go towards developing future projects including a larger, longer work that incorporates 10 boxes.</li>
<li>We currently don't pay ourselves or our contributing artists but this is a goal for the near future.</li>

<p>I am the product of teachers, two parents that loved me unconditionally and instilled the values of education in me early on. And with the good fortune of being raised by such wonderful people, along with the inspiration of too many mentors to mention, it is with the utmost excitement that I have set out to fulfill my lifelong desire to teach, to provide a framework for the development of young people through my experiences in both the performing arts and as a mentor myself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My entire professional life has been leading up to this opportunity. As a professional actor for the past twenty years, I’ve performed in nearly 100 plays, written a dozen more, and enjoyed a relatively busy working life in film, television and commercials. I’ve also been fortunate enough to develop another passion in the form of music, working for the past ten years as a professional musician. I spent a year working as the interim drama instructor at Snipes Academy of Arts and Design and seven years as a Big Buddy. I’ve created numerous original plays for Journey Productions and worked with hundreds of young people, fostering a love for performing in them at an early age. Many have gone on to study acting or writing and a few have burgeoning professional careers of their own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve been blessed with an incredible opportunity by my friend Alisa Harris, thank to her spearheading the construction of a new theater space in downtown Wilmington. Operated as a dinner theater space on weekend evenings, TheatreNOW will also serve as the home for Theatre Network of Wilmington, Inc., the non-profit arm of the organization which I will run as Executive Director. Therefore, our space concerns will be non-existent as we already have a home!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A home for what, you may ask? TNOW, Inc. will be an after-school theater instruction program, where area students can receive a theater education at low or no cost. <strong>For every two students that pay a nominal fee for classes, one student (likely an at-risk, need-based young person) will be provided a scholarship and receive their classes for free.</strong> Also, provided negotiations go as expected with the New Hanover Arts Director, I’ll be providing my services free of charge to area schools that don’t offer theatrical instruction. So if you’re as concerned as I am about the lack of arts education provided by our state and local school systems, here’s your chance to support an artist and a program that’s going to make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Essentially, I’m trying to raise initial start up funds to cover advertising efforts, grant processing, office supplies (laptop, printer, ink, paper, etc.), audio visual equipment (inexpensive cameras, music equipment), costumes, masks, art supplies and other miscellaneous items as well as the initial purchase of snacks and drinks for attendees, among other expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we hope to continue having a strong artistic community, we have to begin with the foundation of that community, our youth, and instill a desire and a passion for performance. I begin this journey as one person determined to make a difference, with goals to grow this organization in to a thriving hub of creativity that flourishes and spills over in to all of the wonderful theater companies that call Wilmington home. So curtain up, dim the lights and let’s get going!</p>

<p>Dancers Over 40, Inc. was created as a not-for-profit organization to provide a community of and a forum for veteran dancers, choreographers and related artists to share common experiences with their peers. The video above features highlights of some of the many panel discussions and performances we have done.  To promote our mission of passing on this cultural legacy to those dancers about to begin their journey, these events are videotaped and archived at the The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. There is no other regional non-profit arts organization that has gone national (via our popular Facebook page: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/dancersover40"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/dancersover40</a>) to promote the community of seasoned dancers in all its forms, styles and techniques. </p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Ron Field: APPLAUSE!</em></strong>  will be presented at the St. Luke's Theater, 308 W 46th Street, New York, NY on Monday, October 21, 2013 and is the most ambitious program Dancers Over 40 has endeavored to produce to date.  Ron Field, one of the underappreciated director/choreographers of the Golden Age of Musical Theater in the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, was a disciple of Jack Cole and danced, choreographed and directed many Broadway shows, television specials and movies.  His breakthrough moment was the original Broadway production of CABARET where he won a Tony Award for choreography.  He also won two Tony Awards for direction and choreography of APPLAUSE! starring Lauren Bacall.  His television specials featured star vehicles for Ben Vereen, Liza Minnelli, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Cheryl Ladd.  The Academy Awards and Tony Awards presentations were both graced by his choreography and he was creative force to be reckoned with until his untimely death in 1989.  Many of the theater’s top performers and DO40 members representing Ron Field’s Broadway productions, television specials and movies will be involved in honoring the man and his impressive body of work. Many, many DO40 members worked for Ron in all of these media and now the world gets to hear about his Life and Legacy directly from the sources. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The hosts for
this event will be Broadway veteran Harvey Evans, Ron Field’s assistant
Marianne Selbert and Ron Field Dancer and DO40 Board Member Lawrence Merritt.
Many of the original cast members of CABARET will be featured in an opening
number staged by Marianne Selbert.  Panelists include Broadway gypsies

Dancers Over 40, Inc. was created as a not-for-profit organization to provide a community of and a forum for veteran dancers, choreographers and related artists to share common experiences with their peers. The video above features highlights of some of the many panel discussions and performances we have done.  To promote our mission of passing on this cultural legacy to those dancers about to begin their journey, these events are videotaped and archived at the The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. There is no other regional non-profit arts organization that has gone national (via our popular Facebook page: www.facebook.com/dancersover40) to promote the community of seasoned dancers in all its forms, styles and techniques. 
The Project
Ron Field: APPLAUSE!  will be presented at the St. Luke's Theater, 308 W 46th Street, New York, NY on Monday, October 21, 2013 and is the most ambitious program Dancers Over 40 has endeavored to produce to date.  Ron Field, one of the underappreciated director/choreographers of the Golden Age of Musical Theater in the 20th Century, was a disciple of Jack Cole and danced, choreographed and directed many Broadway shows, television specials and movies.  His breakthrough moment was the original Broadway production of CABARET where he won a Tony Award for choreography.  He also won two Tony Awards for direction and choreography of APPLAUSE! starring Lauren Bacall.  His television specials featured star vehicles for Ben Vereen, Liza Minnelli, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Cheryl Ladd.  The Academy Awards and Tony Awards presentations were both graced by his choreography and he was creative force to be reckoned with until his untimely death in 1989.  Many of the theater’s top performers and DO40 members representing Ron Field’s Broadway productions, television specials and movies will be involved in honoring the man and his impressive body of work. Many, many DO40 members worked for Ron in all of these media and now the world gets to hear about his Life and Legacy directly from the sources. 

The hosts for
this event will be Broadway veteran Harvey Evans, Ron Field’s assistant
Marianne Selbert and Ron Field Dancer and DO40 Board Member Lawrence Merritt.
Many of the original cast members of CABARET will be featured in an opening
number staged by Marianne Selbert.  Panelists include Broadway gypsies
Rita O’Connor, Carol Hanzel and Lee Roy Reams.  The following performers
have voiced their support and we are hoping that scheduling will allow them to
participate:  Marge Champion, Joel Grey, Sandy Duncan and Don Correia. Ben
Vereen, Debbie Allen and Mikhail Baryshnikov have also been approached to
participate in some way. In addition, there will be video appearances by Harold
Prince and Lauren Bacall.

Where the Money Goes
We are seeking $6,000.00 to fund this event to help cover the costs of transportation, rehearsal space, marketing and publicity materials, stage crew, videographer, equipment, rentals, insurance and other production-associated costs.  To support and continue DO40’s stated mission of preserving the History, Legacy and Lives of our members and to pay it forward to the next generation, our professional videographer will deliver an archival copy of the evening’s event to the Jerome Robbins Dance Collection at the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts.  Past events have honored Bob Fosse, Gower Champion, Jack Cole, Michael Kidd, Peter Gennaro, Agnes de Mille, Gwen Verdon and many more.

Diner tells the story of people dealing with a changing America. Set against the 
backdrop of 1960s Hollywood, the denizens of the L.A. Diner literally 
live and work in the shadow of the 20th Century Fox Studio lot where 
they see some of the day's most famous faces and cater to the crews and 
screenwriters that really make the magic happen. These people; two chefs
 - one black and one white, an aging hostess, a waitress/aspiring 
actress, a gossip reporter, a stand in for a top screen icon, and a 
formerly blacklisted writer - learn who they really are as a result of

Audiences will be transported to Hollywood in 1962 when the world's most famous actress was shooting her final movie!ABOUT THE SHOWHi folks, I'm Ed Mills, writer and executive producer of the exciting new play ""The LA Diner"". Snappy dialogue, fascinating characters and intriguing content with a side of Americana are all served up in this little Diner as Marilyn Monroe is making her final, and ultimately unfinished, film called ""Something's Got to Give"". Please help us bring this show to the stage and receive our heartfelt thanks and some wonderful perks.""I read the play and I love it. Very well written and engaging, and as an actor, really exciting to me. It's beautiful. Tears at the end. I was invested in the characters, especially Em and Evie. Love that it memorializes Marilyn without being another show about Marilyn"" -- Chelsie, Company Manager for Theatre AspenThe L.A. Diner tells the story of people dealing with a changing America. Set against the 
backdrop of 1960s Hollywood, the denizens of the L.A. Diner literally 
live and work in the shadow of the 20th Century Fox Studio lot where 
they see some of the day's most famous faces and cater to the crews and 
screenwriters that really make the magic happen. These people; two chefs
 - one black and one white, an aging hostess, a waitress/aspiring 
actress, a gossip reporter, a stand in for a top screen icon, and a 
formerly blacklisted writer - learn who they really are as a result of 
how they react to the changing culture of Hollywood and America during 
one of the most tumultuous times either has experienced. With original music by Jon Stubbs, Arlene & Russell Kortright and The David Klein Quintet.""I love your CD 'My Marilyn' and know Marilyn would have gotten a big kick out of hearing it (Maybe she still does)."" -- Jane RussellWHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GETOur goal is to raise $3,600 to help with production costs: theater rental at The Dairy Center for the Arts, music, scenic design, lighting design, costumes, set building, marketing/publicity and printing.

Since 1999 we have brought our unique dance-theater to venues, public spaces and alternative sites, and founded a performance salon in our own apartment. 2013 is our 10th Anniversary Season and we are thrilled to be able to share it with you. <br/><br/>We have experimented with alternative spaces since almost our founding. Our very first show, ""Not A Step,"" was created to fit into our friend's Auckland, NZ living room. We have performed in theaters, galleries, up and down Valencia Street, in Golden Gate Park's AIDS Memorial Grove and perched on ruined walls at the Sutro Baths. We have played with the audience-performer relationship by dancing for surveillance cameras over bank machines in the Financial District during the winter holiday rush, and have performed undercover in crowds at art openings. This year's project is the culmination of these ideas about space, place and point of view.<br/><br/>""What Stays"" is a touring home-theater extravaganza that will take place from October 18 through November 9 in three private home-theater venues in the Bay Area. It features the tremendous talents of physical performer John Baumann, musical theaterist and dancer Lisa Claybaugh, dancers Laura Marsh and Jennifer Minore and David Samas, musician and instrument inventor who will play live at the event with guest musicians each weekend. I will be performing with the ensemble and there will also be some brand new songs by composer Dave Rodgers. The show takes the form of a performance installation in which the audience can walk through the house to different rooms, hallways and nooks to discover the different sections of the piece. Our brilliant lighting designer, Allen Willner, has been dreaming up transformations using everyday lamps, strings of lights and flashlights. <br/><br/>This project is especially important not only because it is our tenth season, or because it breaks new ground in how space is used and inhabited by theater and dance, but also for its timely and intriguing theme. The piece interweaves ideas about “home” and “time,” exploring how homes are inhabited and cherished in a region where housing is a complex issue.  According to SFist, average July rents for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco cost $2,800. SFGate wrote that the average home price in San Francisco topped $1 million in June. For many Bay Area people, home, whether it is rented or owned, is a major part of their budget and their lives. Living spaces loom large in our imaginations and realities. This deep well of metaphor is where we now dip our creative ladle. <br/><br/>The three homes that will be hosting “What Stays” are wonderful, warm spaces with lovely hosts who have generously opened their homes to us and our audiences for this event. Each home is in a different region. The first, called The First Avenue Salon, is in Half Moon Bay. Jane and Ed Hanson purchased the land and built their house in such a way as to be close to the ocean that Jane, a lifelong scuba-diver and a registered nurse who helped to rescue seals for much of her adult life, loved so much. The second, Turquoise Yantra Grotto, is in the Diamond Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, the home of David Samas, Grace Renaud and their four children. David’s grandparents built the house in the 1960s. David returned to raise his children and transformed the home into an alternative theater for new music and performance. The final home, Chez 360, is in the Lake Merritt neighborhood of Oakland, the home of Jennifer Minore and John Hayes. They bought the house after many years of living in a tiny junior one bedroom garden apartment in the same neighborhood. <br/><br/>Over the past few months we've rehearsed in all of the amazing venues where we plan to perform. We have mapped each space, danced in its planes and valleys, and sung so that our voices found the nooks between the rafters. We have read the spines of beloved books, walked backwards on treadmills, climbed up to the roof, played with puppies, talked and squawked with pet birds, stayed out of the most private spaces and folded the hand towel after using it. We have discovered places where our character creations can play, figured out where audience members will be most comfortable and other ways to express the terrain that we have explored. <br/><br/>More importantly, we have listened. We met partners, children and grandparents, each of whom carry stories that live in each space. They have shared their tales and dreams in and about their spaces...the loneliness of a house for family that is far away, the multifaceted chaos of many children and the echoes of ancestors, the love of the nearby Pacific Ocean and its seals as a shared dream by two people who love each other. <br/><br/>Our virtual partner in London, Apryl Renee Pipe, has met each host while in her home on another continent, bridging over five thousand miles and shortening the distance to the small span between two sets of eyes and each voice, aided by technology.<br/><br/><b>What we need...</b><br/><br/>What we are attempting is difficult - three entirely different shows that bring alive the metaphorical realities of each space. While we are not renting the venues we are investing deeply in the people who are making this happen, performers, designers, hosts. Think about it...three shows, three weekends, three sites. Three load-ins, three tech rehearsals, three opening nights. All of these require more travel and more child care. These commitments are in addition to our regular studio rehearsals. Last, but not least, Allen Willner will be building a portable light and effects kit that will have to be set up differently for each home-theater space. <br/><br/><b>Here are the details. </b><br/><br/>We have budgeted $800.00 for each of our three regular performers for a total of $2,400.00. Our London collaborator will receive $500.00. <br/>The lighting designer, Allen Willner, will earn $1,750.00.<br/>These salaries, totaling $4,350.00, are due by the first performance on October 18th. <br/><br/><b>Here is what we are proposing.</b><br/><br/><b>Our initial goal is $2,100.00 to first pay our three performers, Lisa Claybaugh, Laura Marsh and Jennifer Minore - beautiful and professional artists all. </b>They have been performing with us for the last decade, attending rehearsals at least once a week for most of the year. Lisa and Laura are both mothers of small children. Lisa is also expecting her second child soon after our show closes. While we are aware that their time and effort cost much more than what we have budgeted, this is what we can do this year. We are so lucky to have them as co-conspirators and would be incredibly thankful to be able to raise the proposed funds to pay them. If we can make our initial goal this year, it will be a first step towards paying them something close to a living wage in years to come. <br/><br/><b>If we can raise $500 more, that will go to Apryl Renee Pipe,</b> who has doggedly attended rehearsals once and sometimes twice a week over video-conferencing from London for the last few months and will be performing with us at 4:00am GMT each weekend in full makeup and costume. Wow. <br/><br/>We are also spending extra on Allen’s lighting work this year because of the unusual circumstances and extra travel on his part while he and his wife juggle the commitments of jobs and their newborn son. <b>Therefore, anything above and beyond the first $2,800.00 will go towards Allen's salary. </b><br/><br/><b>We have some great perks, too.</b> <br/><br/></span></span></span>We're giving away great stuff - VIP tickets (only available through this Indiegogo campaign!), a gluten-free recipe booklet made up of recipes served as snacks at our past home-theater shows, a valuable retrospective photo book and our iconic company tee shirts. So that you can get a better idea, here is a picture of the shirt. It comes in women's or men's fitted medium, large and extra large sizes. We can do kids sizes, too. <br/><br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><ul><li>

It is about the poetics of politics, a revised American Dream, how we live and raise our families.

<p><i><b>History of the plays</b>:</i> </p>
<p>After a very successful debut with sold out houses for both
Ann Morrison and Blake Walton in the 2012 United Solo Theatre festival, winning awards for both plays and being welcomed as members of the Solo Academy, they
were invited back to do encore performances for the 2013 Festival
either repeating the plays they performed in 2012 or introducing new works, which is the
option they chose.</p>
<p>Blake as a playwright had never written a solo play but
had some ideas for an original autobiographical piece stewing in his head over the
course of the past year. Once he opened the floodgates, the words came charging
out until he had a 70 minute narrative monologue. Ann had also been harvesting
ideas for a new play and she too found the words came easily. There was a
parallel in their separate processes in that they thought they were writing
about one thing and the journey took them to a perspective they were not
expecting. </p>
<p>Ann began to discover she was revisiting her mother in a
profound way, as an art student in 1942, a painter, dancer, poet, lyricist,
playwright, and director. Her play was now incorporating dance and poetry at
times to tell the story as well. <b><i>Word Painting: Soliloquies Around An Easel</i></b>
became a loving tribute to her creative role model, her mother as a Renaissance
woman. </p>
<p>Blake thought he was only writing about what it is to be a “real
man” in this society, but as he began filtering his definition through stories
about his father, his own fatherhood and stories of his son, he found a
demonstration of “manhood” through “fatherhood” and his own evolution into an
adult son. His surprise came with the tremendous empowerment he experienced
through the honest telling in <b><i>Leading Men</i></b>, a tale that had not
been voiced before, of the road he has taken with these two most influential
men in his life.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Blake and Ann have a vital working relationship and as they have
in the past, they will each direct the other’s play. There are plans </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to present b</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">oth plays as a

About the plays:



Blake Walton tells the truth in his
poignant and funny evolution to manhood as he and his father find an understanding
and acceptance of, and finally a profound admiration for each other after he
becomes a father himself. “One cannot be what one is naturally, born to be, at
the core, not. It ain’t something that comes and goes. It is in the atoms of
our being, it is something essential.”
2012 United Solo Best Premiere Award Winner. 
Director: Ann Morrison. Company Manager: David
Coyle. 




Inspired by her own experience as a model for art students,
Broadway veteran Ann Morrison takes a profound look at her late mother, an artist
and true ""Renaissance Woman"", through the personalities around an art easel: the
Model, the Student Artist, the Critic and the Art itself, leading her audience
through a poetic, lyrical dance.
2012 United Solo Best Actress Award Winner. 
Director: Blake Walton. Choreography Consultant: Garfield
Lemonius. Artwork Created By: Karle H. Murdock. Company Manager: David Coyle.

<p>We are Launching Part Two of our Season 12 Fundraising Campaign!</p>
<p>Our Original Campaign Goal was $10,000 and in just 21 days we hit half of our goal! Which is amazing and wonderful! We have raised funds to cover the cost of our Fall Repertory Venue, but we still have a long way to go! <br/>But we still need to raise another $5,000 to keep our season going!<br/><br/>3 Productions this fall and 3 more next spring! We have a ambitious goal and know with your help we can make it happen! </p>
<p>This fall Rising Sun Performance Company hits a significant landmark in our history, one that few indie theatre companies in NYC will ever reach. We celebrate 12 years of making our signature raw, evocative, engaging and authentic theatrical experiences.</p>
<p>As we embark on Season 12, we put an emphasis on new works created from within the ensemble, including  The world premiere of Ice Age from resident playwright Mike Aguirre, Original Devised work that we will present as guests at festivals and special events, a return to the work in progress “Henry’s Wives” along with two revivals of published works: Brilliant Traces by Cindy Lou Johnson and the Remount of RSP’s inaugural production Hellcab by Will Kern. <b>The next 4 months promises to be filled with many exciting moments on and off stage </b>featuring the work of our talented ensemble, playwrights, directors  and an immensely talented design and support team.  Our Fall/Winter Season will run from October 30<span>th thru December 20th.  </span></p>
<p>We have existed this long by working in the most cost effective and innovative ways possible. By the grace of donors and grants, donated space, in kind costumes, and with the exceptionally hard work of a 100% volunteer run staff and ensemble we have presented over 55 productions &amp; events.  However, as cost effective as we run our company, we still need a significant amount of funding in order to function as a viable company in NYC. </p>
<p>IN ORDER FOR SEASON 12 TO HAPPEN, <br/>WE MUST RAISE an additional $5,000 WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH</p>
<p><b>What we have in place:</b><br/>Exciting New Works By Talented Playwrights<br/>Killer Innovative Designers<br/>Top Notch Directors<br/>Breathtaking Actors<br/>Stellar Stage Managers<br/>&amp; Wonderful Spaces to Rehearse in </p>
<p><b>Here is the short list of what we need to accomplish our 12th season</b><br/>$5,000 for our fall Rep Venue &lt;&lt;&lt; RAISED! ACCOMPLISHED</p>
<p>We still need this:<br/>$1,200 for our Hellcab Venue<br/>$1,600 for Royalty Rights for Brilliant Traces &amp; Hellcab<br/>$1,950 for Festival Fees for Henry’s Wives, Ice Age &amp; Erik (If accepted into festivals) <br/>$3,500 to pay our 3 Stage Managers, Publicist &amp; Designers<br/>$2,000 for our Set, Props &amp; Costumes<br/>$1,500 for rehearsal space<br/>$700 for Postcards &amp; Posters <br/>$500 for Liability &amp; Event Insurance <br/>$1,000 for sound, lighting &amp; Audio Visual technology<br/><br/><b>Be a part of our collective history and give Season 12 a chance to succeed! Donate today!</b></p>
<p>After the success of last year’s Hotel Suite, we look to return to a non-traditional venue to provide our audiences with an up-close and unforgettable theatrical experience. <br/><br/>So, almost all of the pieces have fallen into place – we have an amazing group of directors, playwrights, actors and collaborators. <b>THIS IS the team to make our season happen, BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP to get there!</b>  We are in negotiations with a great venue, but we need to pay for the space in order to move forward! </p>
<p>Here is where you get to be a part of the show!  Every donation goes a long way to making this season and our future seasons a reality. AND with ongoing updates on this campaign, fun hands on perks including backstage access, walk on roles and meet &amp; greet opportunities, we make sure that you aren’t just in the audience but in on the action.</p>
<p>DONATIONS WILL UNLOCK UPDATES AND CHALLENGES FOR CHANCES TO WIN PRIZES</p>
<p>Help us continue our legacy of bold, exciting and uncompromising theatre just for you.</p>
<p><b><u>See the sidebar for the AWESOME PERKS starting with just a $10 DONATION!</u></b><br/><br/>The most important element besides the cool perks is the impact of having your money support local independent theatre in a very real way. <b>You could be a direct part of an exciting theatrical event and a leader in supporting art on a grassroots level</b>.<br/><br/>Rising Sun Performance Company is a vital part of the Off-Off Broadway landscape; being one of the longest running ensemble companies at our producing level in NYC.  Established in 2001, we are a small but prolific non-profit theatre company, having produced over 55 productions and events both locally and nationally.

<p>If we don’t reach our goal, we will have to postpone our planned productions. </p>

This fall Rising Sun Performance Company hits a significant landmark in our history, one that few indie theatre companies in NYC will ever reach. We celebrate 12 years of making our signature raw, evocative, engaging and authentic theatrical experiences.
As we embark on Season 12, we put an emphasis on new works created from within the ensemble, including  The world premiere of Ice Age from resident playwright Mike Aguirre, Original Devised work that we will present as guests at festivals and special events, a return to the work in progress “Henry’s Wives” along with two revivals of published works: Brilliant Traces by Cindy Lou Johnson and the Remount of RSP’s inaugural production Hellcab by Will Kern. The next 4 months promises to be filled with many exciting moments on and off stage featuring the work of our talented ensemble, playwrights, directors  and an immensely talented design and support team.  Our Fall/Winter Season will run from October 30th thru December 20th.  
We have existed this long by working in the most cost effective and innovative ways possible. By the grace of donors and grants, donated space, in kind costumes, and with the exceptionally hard work of a 100% volunteer run staff and ensemble we have presented over 55 productions & events.  However, as cost effective as we run our company, we still need a significant amount of funding in order to function as a viable company in NYC. 
IN ORDER FOR SEASON 12 TO HAPPEN, WE MUST RAISE an additional $5,000 WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH
What we have in place:Exciting New Works By Talented PlaywrightsKiller Innovative DesignersTop Notch DirectorsBreathtaking ActorsStellar Stage Managers& Wonderful Spaces to Rehearse in 
Here is the short list of what we need to accomplish our 12th season$5,000 for our fall Rep Venue <<< RAISED! ACCOMPLISHED
We still need this:$1,200 for our Hellcab Venue$1,600 for Royalty Rights for Brilliant Traces & Hellcab$1,950 for Festival Fees for Henry’s Wives, Ice Age & Erik (If accepted into festivals) $3,500 to pay our 3 Stage Managers, Publicist & Designers$2,000 for our Set, Props & Costumes$1,500 for rehearsal space$700 for Postcards & Posters $500 for Liability & Event Insurance $1,000 for sound, lighting & Audio Visual technologyBe a part of our collective history and give Season 12 a chance to succeed! Donate today!
After the success of last year’s Hotel Suite, we look to return to a non-traditional venue to provide our audiences with an up-close and unforgettable theatrical experience. So, almost all of the pieces have fallen into place – we have an amazing group of directors, playwrights, actors and collaborators. THIS IS the team to make our season happen, BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP to get there!  We are in negotiations with a great venue, but we need to pay for the space in order to move forward! 
Here is where you get to be a part of the show!  Every donation goes a long way to making this season and our future seasons a reality. AND with ongoing updates on this campaign, fun hands on perks including backstage access, walk on roles and meet & greet opportunities, we make sure that you aren’t just in the audience but in on the action.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><i>Judith: The Other Shakespeare</i> was a dream of my friend and 
colleague, Mr. Kevin Stackhouse and, like many of his dreams, he likes 
to see them become a reality. Judith, however, is very special as 
compared to previous projects such as <i>After Carpathia</i> since it is
 one of Kevin's first full-length, immensely involved, and absolutely 
brilliant MUSICAL complete with more than twenty musical numbers 
spanning two hours. It is a spectacle to see and appreciate!</p>
<p>The 
play is based on the essay by Virginia Woolf, ""A Room of One's Own"" and 
follows the legendary writer through her own thoughts as she paints a 
picture of her life and her stream of consciousness on many layers 
including: who REALLY wrote the plays of William Shakespeare, what 
inspired her to do so, and how this extraordinary tale of love, loss, 
failure, triumph, and the path of an artist directly mirrors Virginia's 
own life. </p>Next to the play itself, the most important part of 
this entire production is the cast. In fact, this cast has been one of 
the greatest I  have ever had to work with in my entire life and, 
following some financial trouble, I do not want to be forced to shut 
this play down and risk the hard work of my beloved cast members. They 
are good at what they do and have given their all this entire time and, 
if we are not able to pay one of the two composers <i>before</i> ticket sales we cannot use his music...If we cannot use his music I cannot show you what these amazing actors and actresses have to offer to you and how they will honor Kevin' work.<p>For
 as generous a donation as you can afford, please help us raise $1000 to
 get this show back on track so that I can sign a worthy paycheck for my
 more-than-worthy actors. </p>
<p>We need your help so that we can 
entertain you and help bring the aspirations of Kevin, the cast, my 
crew, and this wonderful play to life as many of these actors and 
actresses are looking to make headway in the theatre world and this 
could be the beginning of their big break! </p>
<p>Come see us at the 
Rotunda Theater on March 11th and 18th at 7:30 and a possible matinee 
performance on the 18th at 3:00pm and come to my Carnevale Masquerade 
Ball in February for a night of music, dancing, games of chance, and 
unparalleled entertainment (including magic, juggling, comedy and a 
sneak preview of Judith)</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In short, if this campaign does  not occur one of our composers will not allow us to use his FOUR songs and, becasue of that, the show will not go on! All of my actors will have rehearsed in vain, a year's worth of time, effort, love, and dedication will disappear, and Kevin's 2 years of writing will never see light.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you help us the money will go DIRECTLY to the composer so that our show can continue. In addition to this we are holding a bake sale, looking for sponsors and backers, and selling messages for a message board for our actors ALL in an attempt to get these guys a paycheck and get this show on the road. I am not going to lie, we have a lot of expenses to tackle in addition to the composer's but, with your help, we can focus on more applicable goals and use our other fundraisers to achieve them</p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>Pledge $1 or more</h3>

LETTERS TO LAURA
What happens when your entire relationship is based on perception? Have we been honest with each other, or is who we are just a projection of the perfect version of us? In this image that we have created, there are no flaws, no mistakes, and no substance. What happens when you change parts of yourself, just to feel loved? Is it real, or are we lonelier than ever? What is hidden behind the words?In Letters to Laura, we will follow two people in love with each other, as they try to find the answers to the questions everyone is asking. The hard part? They live in two different countries.We now have the wonderful opportunity to not only take this play to the world renowned Edmonton International Fringe Festival in August, but we have recently received some very wonderful news. Letters To Laura has been chosen to be performed in the San Diego Fringe Festival in July! This means our deadline is much closer than anticipated and we have a few more expenses that we weren't planning on. What happens to the money?The funds raised for this project will go to the production costs themselves and the cost of getting the show to San Diego.

So just because we need help getting to San Diego, you will still be able to see where all of your support went, and maybe even get to meet to the Cast and Crew involved.This is my first International performance therefore I really want it to be the best it can be.

Sweetie Maude is the lesbian version of Sweeney Todd set in  Chicago. Sweetie Maude is a woman scorned. When Sweetie was young she was forced to leave Chicago because of her forbidden love with a closeted pregnant lesbian madame. Local magistrate, Judge Turpin, saw the love Sweetie had for the Madame and was jealous, for he too loved the Madame, and could not bear to see the two woman raise the madame's bastard child, Savannah. The judge sent Sweetie away, drove the madame to certain death and is now planning on marrying his the now orphaned daughter, Savannah.Twenty years later, Sweetie has come back to exact her revenge.

Sweetie Maude is the all-female, lesbian version of Sweeney Todd. Set in Chicago in a timeless age, Sweetie Maude is the story of jealousy, cruelty and ultimately, of revenge.  Although this musical is a pastiche (a work of art that closely and lovingly imitates the original work) of Sweeney Todd, Sweetie Maude finds it’s own voice. Maude resonates as an all-female story: manipulation, jealousy and revenge find their home in our anti-hero Sweetie, but we also see strength, and power. 
When Sabrina got the idea for Maude, she brought in her very best friend, fellow improviser Margaret Hicks. Margaret had her own passion for Sondheim and together, the two of them fully realized the idea of Sweetie Maude. 
 
The cast is culled from people the two have worked with at Second City, The Annoyance and The Playground for the past 15 years. Sweetie will run at Studio Be starting September 26, 2013 and will run through October 31, ending with a Halloween finale the likes of which have never been seen before!
 
Sabrina and Margaret are looking for help to produce the show. The biggest expense of course, is the theater. We also will need help with sets, costumes, etc.
 
AND NOW THE CAST!!
 
Please welcome new cast members Denise Swindell and Amy Thompson!!! Denise  will be angry and sarcastic playing the part of BEAVER. Amy will be rolling around on skates and singing sweet tunes as the role of TOOTIE!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><img align=""right"" alt=""Gordon's Parents"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lilrayofsunshine.com/catoncenterstage/images/gordons_parents.jpg"" hspace=""12"" src="""" style=""""/>I grew up in the swamplands of south Louisiana. Both of my parents (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">pictured, right</span>), in fact my entire family, are the hardest workers I've ever known. My father is the definition of a ""blue-collar"" worker, someone who has worked with his hands his whole life, almost entirely under the scorching Louisiana sun. My mother and father both worked hard at two jobs to send me to Louisiana State University, and it was there that I first saw <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</span>. It was set in a southern culture, where football heroes ruled the day and the facade of southern grace and manners hid much darker themes of truth. I grew up in that culture and knew it well, and the play's writing has stayed with me since then, for nearly 20 years.</p>
<p><br/>I was home visiting my family while working on a scene from the play for an acting class. My father saw the play in my hands and said ""'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof?' That's the play about 'mendacity,' isn't it?"" I was an athlete in high school, initially studied journalism at LSU, and was headed for a career in sports broadcasting. That was until I took an acting class, and every other color faded but that one. My father and I had never shared a conversation about a play until that moment. We talked about the play and its characters, Big Daddy and Brick, and of course, Maggie the Cat. And I knew that one day I would have to speak Williams' lines on stage, in honor of that moment and my own roots.</p>
<p><br/>So that's why I decided to produce this show and do just that - play Brick - to honor the brilliant work of Tennessee Williams, and to honor how the written word and theater itself can create moments that truly do bring two people together in unexpected ways.<br/></p>
<h3>Depending <span style=""font-style: italic;"">on the kindness of strangers</span>, friends and family</h3>
<p>To make this dream a reality, we're going to need your help, or it simply won't happen. With the rights unavailable in the Los Angeles area, we're taking the show up the coast to beautiful Santa Barbara. That also means the added expenses of housing the cast and crew, and so many more costs that come with producing a show.</p>
<p><br/>Your donation to us will be the difference. If you can't join us for our performances on July 14-17, then perhaps you can help us in another way. We've created what we feel are fun tokens of our appreciation to you for your donations to us. Any amount helps, as I am not producing this show with an already existing theater company, but rather doing it on my own financially. We are asking you, our supporters, to help us raise the funds to cover a portion of the overall costs of doing a play out of town, since those involved in the production live in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p><br/>This is truly a passion project, and if you have ever had a dream of your own, one that needed the help of others to see it through, then I hope you will be able to do the same for us. As Williams himself once wrote in another one of his classics, ""I have always depended on the kindness of strangers."" Now we depend on that kindness from you, our friends, families, and supporters, to help us realize this dream. Thank you.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There is a reason <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</span> is as popular today as ever. The themes that Williams wrote about (family, truth, greed, sexuality, alcoholism, deception) are just as vivid and present in people's everyday lives in one form or another as they were in 1955. Every audience member can see some part of their own lives or their own families onstage while watching this play, and most have only seen the film version, which had to edit much of the story Williams wanted to tell due to Motion Picture Association codes that were in place at the time. We have a chance to show new audiences a play that perhaps they know of, but have never actually seen.</p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>These are just a few of the ways in which your donations will help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Housing in Santa Barbara for our cast/crew for 6 nights: $1750</li>

<li>Materials to build our set and truck rentals: $500</li>
</ul><p><br/>There are many more costs that we're not listing here (theater rental, posters, postcards, website costs, royalty fees), but covering this $2,500 of the show's costs will do so much to help us get the production through.</p>

Our Story
I grew up in the swamplands of south Louisiana. Both of my parents (pictured, right), in fact my entire family, are the hardest workers I've ever known. My father is the definition of a ""blue-collar"" worker, someone who has worked with his hands his whole life, almost entirely under the scorching Louisiana sun. My mother and father both worked hard at two jobs to send me to Louisiana State University, and it was there that I first saw Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. It was set in a southern culture, where football heroes ruled the day and the facade of southern grace and manners hid much darker themes of truth. I grew up in that culture and knew it well, and the play's writing has stayed with me since then, for nearly 20 years.
I was home visiting my family while working on a scene from the play for an acting class. My father saw the play in my hands and said ""'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof?' That's the play about 'mendacity,' isn't it?"" I was an athlete in high school, initially studied journalism at LSU, and was headed for a career in sports broadcasting. That was until I took an acting class, and every other color faded but that one. My father and I had never shared a conversation about a play until that moment. We talked about the play and its characters, Big Daddy and Brick, and of course, Maggie the Cat. And I knew that one day I would have to speak Williams' lines on stage, in honor of that moment and my own roots.
So that's why I decided to produce this show and do just that - play Brick - to honor the brilliant work of Tennessee Williams, and to honor how the written word and theater itself can create moments that truly do bring two people together in unexpected ways.

<p>Since the summer of 2008, Playlab NYC has wanted to produce an energetic and fun show created out of derivative works relating to pop culture.  In 2010, we invited the team from Coffee Black Productions to a table reading of a variety of short plays, and last year they offered the opportunity for us to pool our resources perform at their favorite venue, Bar 82.  </p>
<p><strong>Of <em>Intellectual Property</em>, Playlab NYC Artistic Director, Kevin P.

<p><strong>Coffee Black Productions</strong> was founded in 2009 by Artistic Director Michael Bloom and Managing Director/Resident Playwright Carrie Boehm in order to perform plays simply, focusing on the playwright’s intentions without directorial embellishments that distort the playwright’s work. In the past two and half years, they have produced 18 evenings of performances ranging from full lengths to series of monologues and collections on one-acts. Throughout all of this, they have collected a core of dedicated playwrights, directors, and actors who keep coming back for more.

<h3>A King of Infinite Beginnings</h3>
<p>So, when I was 9 my father passed away in November. By January, there was a new man in the house and to say that it shook me was an understatement. A year later, I was introduced to Hamlet. Now, I didn't understand the language fully but understood the fear and the rage in Hamlet's heart. And, in my pre-adolescent mind, I plotted ways to kill my stepfather. Needless to say, Hamlet was my all time favorite play.</p>
<p>During college, I was offered a job in Austin, TX. I was on my way to the first day of training from San Antonio. Along the way, I ran into a lot of traffic just outside of San Marcos. I pulled over and asked a guy what was going on. He said that Pearl Jam was playing. I said, ""Fuck it. How much for a ticket?"" I ended up one row from the stage and it was my first ever concert. I fell in love with Eddie Vedder and from then on, Pearl Jam was my all time favorite band.</p>
<p>Thank God, Freedome and Jerry agreed to try and meld the two into a project that would later come to be A King of Infinite Space. After our weekends in the Bronx, we will be offered an opportunity to run for a week at Here Art Center. In order to run the production, we need funding which brings us to you.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>WHEN</strong> </p>
<p>Gonne hits the New Theatre Stage Dublin May 28th - June 8th</p>

<h3>the impact of this project</h3>
<p>Our last go of this project: ""ANIMA MUNDI"" premiered at The Experimental Theatre Wing of NYU's Tisch School of The Arts. In that production each member of the cast felt a new connection to the nonhuman animal they performed as and to the earth's ecology as a whole.</p>
<p>This show brings the environmental into the personal and reveals how personal our ecology is.</p>
<p>In this production, we intend to use Movement Generation's ""Just Transition"", their framework for a fair shift to an economy that is ecologically sustainable, as a guide to how environmental theatre and environmental justice can be relevant to all our lives' complexities.</p>

Well, this is one of those examples, one that’s taken 11 years to happen. And it’s happening in one of the most magical places on Earth at one of the most prestigious international arts festival of them all, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.</p><p>The friends in question are our Creative Director, Amin and Producer, Shai who’ve been friends for years and embarked on their dance and theatre journeys respectively at about the same time about 12 years ago. Since then, they’ve talked about working together but this has never happened until the fateful day Amin informed him that he would be in London (where Shai was at the time in December 2015) soon and this was the spark that started this journey to make bhumi a reality. It wasn’t long after when the pieces fell into place and a solid team of artists was assembled. When we started on the project, we had 3 clear objectives in mind:</p><p><strong>1. Subverting existing perceptions about Malay dance by marrying it with western contemporary  dance</strong></p><p>When one pictures Malay dance, the image conjured is one that is filled with colourful costumes and headgear, exotic-looking traditional props and stories about life in the yesteryears, living in a kampong (village). Plus, the form itself is instructional and structured and we wanted to challenge what we understand Malay dance to be. We decided to pair it with contemporary dance, which is more abstract and fluid and see what each can form can learn from and give to each other. Of the 6 dancers, only 2 have had any background in Malay dance.</p><p><strong>2. Creating a platform for emerging Singaporean &amp; British artists based in the UK to showcase their practice</strong></p><p>We wanted to provide a platform for practicing Singaporean &amp; British artists pursuing their postgraduate and undergraduate studies in the UK to expand on their work and practice in an overseas market while also providing a platform for emerging  artists pursuing their undergraduate studies to have opportunities to develop their practice outside of the school context.</p><p><strong>3. Cultural exchange</strong></p><p>We wanted to introduce, showcase and exchange the Malay arts with collaborators and audiences who may be less familiar with the Malay arts or the unique cultural offering from Singapore or the region. This would be an opportunity for non-Malays and/or non-Singaporeans to learn a new dance form and gain cultural insight into the Malay culture and at the same time, being at the Edinburgh Fringe means we get to present something we love to an international audience.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469932058/nrccoimczwsvpwbzrtb4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Photography by Stanley Lin</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH6r4mynvRg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>Our producer, Shai spoke about the show at the launch of the Anglo-Asiatic Arts &amp; Heritage Alliance (AAAHA) at SOAS, University of London recently.</p><p>The members of our multicultural and multinational team come from some of the best schools in the United Kingdom.</p><p><strong>London Contemporary Dance School</strong><br/>Zunnur Zhafirah Binte Sazali<br/>Venetia Lim<br/>Heather Birley<br/>Jimmy Adams<br/>Onyx Hinds</p><p><strong>Royal Central School of Speech and Drama</strong><br/>Mohamad Shaifulbahri (Shai)<br/>Grace Khoo<br/>Stella Cheung<br/>Nicholas Tee</p><p><strong>Royal College of Music</strong><br/>Nabillah Jalal</p><p><strong>University of Roehampton/CHOREOMUNDUS</strong><br/>Soultari Amin Farid</p><p><strong>Look Ma, We're in the Papers!</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468668373/uusvplpuh7m5jl3unual.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Straits Times, Singapore, 31st May 2016</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469324278/wvrcjljqt9cvaug2nslk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Berita Harian, Singapore, 24th July 2016</p><p><strong>The Truth</strong></p><p>If you think this sounds like an ambitious undertaking, the truth is, it is.

<p>We’re so excited to bring you All’s Faire this 2016-2017 season at Action/Adventure Theatre! All’s Faire is a passion project, a story written and created by us about the ridiculous misadventures of the quirky staff at ""Medieval Fun Park Portland"", a corporate Renaissance Faire. It follows the Action/Adventure signature format of serialized comedies; a “theatre for TV people” format with an overarching story told over the course of 4 episodes, with a different episode performed every weekend. </p>
<p>Initially conceived as a workshop piece on improvised theatre during Isinglass' summer theatre leadership education program, the play quickly took on a life of its own. It was submitted to and then selected for performance in Action/Adventure's 2016 Pilot Season. After a full production of the first episode, and a sold-out Pilot Season run, All’s Faire was selected by audience votes to be renewed for a full season!</p>
<p>The show is full of slap-stick humor, sword-based innuendos, magic, madness, young love, old love, middle of the road love, wizards, magic cups, sorceresses, jousts, and a mysteriously insightful goat. </p>
<p>Since our first writing process this story has grown into something large and exciting, bringing in a variety of collaborators beyond our team of students, including our marvelous cast, crew and writers. This show has been a joy to work on, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to get it out to you!</p>
</div><p>This is our first professional theatrical endeavor as a group of creators and we’re so excited to be working on this project, but as a small group of practitioners we don’t have the same resources that a more established group might. To that end, we are trying to raise $2,000 to help offset the cost of tickets, pay for critical elements like costumes and set pieces, and MOST critically - to compensate our delightful cast, who have already invested huge amounts of their time to bring this show to fruition. Any amount will help us with our goal to create better, more interesting theatre for you- the audience member!</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>The All's Faire team</p></div>","We’re so excited to bring you All’s Faire this 2016-2017 season at Action/Adventure Theatre!

Since our first writing process this story has grown into something large and exciting, bringing in a variety of collaborators beyond our team of students, including our marvelous cast, crew and writers. This show has been a joy to work on, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to get it out to you!
This is our first professional theatrical endeavor as a group of creators and we’re so excited to be working on this project, but as a small group of practitioners we don’t have the same resources that a more established group might. To that end, we are trying to raise $2,000 to help offset the cost of tickets, pay for critical elements like costumes and set pieces, and MOST critically - to compensate our delightful cast, who have already invested huge amounts of their time to bring this show to fruition. Any amount will help us with our goal to create better, more interesting theatre for you- the audience member!Thanks!The All's Faire team",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Well Hello!</h2>
<p>We are the 2016 Williamstown Theatre Festival Non-Equity Company, and we're having a showcase. </p>
<h3><strong>Tell me more about the WTF Non-Eq company.</strong></h3>
<p>Here's what the WTF website says:</p>
<p>""The Non-Equity Company is a nationally recognized, highly competitive group of young actors who have committed themselves to a career as professional actors. This company is drawn in large part from the top graduate programs in the country, and also through our extensive submission and audition process in NYC each spring.  [...] Members of the Non-Equity Company (or, “Non-Eqs”) supplement the Equity Company in Main Stage and Nikos Stage productions, and play principal roles in the Community Engagement and Fellowship productions.""</p>
<h3><b>Okay great! So what's a showcase and why are you having one?</b></h3>
<p>A showcase is an hour-long show when members of the Non Equity Company will perform for industry professionals. Each Non-Eq is in two scenes with another Non-Eq, showing off what they do best. It's an opportunity for us to show off the hard work we did this summer and make important business connections that can take us to the next step in our careers. </p>
<h3>What's the money going towards? </h3>
<p>WTF graciously covers half the cost of showcase, and the other half comes from the Non-Eqs personally. We are fundraising to help defray those costs. As we've mentioned, we're early career actors, and there are only so many cater-waitering shifts in a week. Your donation will go towards: </p>
<p>The rental cost of the theatre for our performance space<br/>Publicity materials and invitations for the Showcase (postcards, stamps, mailing labels, etc.)<br/>Headshot and Resume printing <br/>IndieGoGo’s Support Fee</p>
<p>Any donation you can make - no matter how large or small - will make a big difference. </p>
<h3>What's in it for me?</h3>
<p>We're sending everyone who donates a handwritten thank you card. Also, Ryan Haddad has promised to thank each and every one of you in his 2021 Best Actor Oscar Speech.**</p>
<p>**Ryan has promised to do no such thing. That's a joke. However, we feel pretty good about the odds of him winning an Oscar in 2021.</p>
<h3>If I can't donate, how else can I support the 2016 Non Eq showcase?</h3>
<p>Post about us on social media! Facebook, twitter, snapchat, myspace, friendster--whatever you're on, share our campaign and spread the love. </p>
<h3>THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP!</h3>

<p>There are many shows that celebrate the holiday season in New York's theatre district, but NONE with the unique perspective and, well, soul of SOUL NATIVITY.  We're aiming to raise funds to bring the show back, BIGGER AND BETTER than ever for the 2013 Holiday Season and need <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">YOU</span> to help us do it.  With your support, we know that this show that has already touched so many hearts with its inspired celebration, dance and music, will go on to be an annual event that moves audiences this year and for years to come. </p>
<p>We are seeking to raise a total of $90,000.00 through this campaign, and will use the money as follows:</p>
<p>-$40,000 dollars will pay half of the salary for the entire run of the show for our actors, dancers and musicians, a hard-working company of 18 who pour their hearts into the show every night</p>
<p>-$20,000 will create all of the costumes and scenery for our production</p>
<p>-$15,000 puts a deposit on the rental of our theatre and guarantees SOUL NATIVITY a place in the theatre district during the holiday season</p>
<p>-$10,000 will provide mics and sound equipment </p>
<p>-$5,000 will allow us to conduct an extensive grassroots outreach program to local churches, schools and community groups to make them a part of our performance event, audience and extended family</p>
<p>When you join Soul Nativity you become a part of our production family, no matter at what level you join,  You will receive our production updates, casting announcements and press releases.  Those joining us at hgher levels will become part of our audience and team of producers, duly credited in our program and production materials.  Best of all everyone who supports Soul Nativity becomes an original angel behind the creation of a show unique to the New York holiday scene and destined to become an annual treasure.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>New York during the holiday season is a frenetic and exciting place, particularly in the Times Square area.  Tourists from all over the world, shoppers, theatre lovers and people hustling their day jobs create one of the most intense scenes anywhere in the city of New York and beyond.  And although New York features a number of attractions geared toward family and fun, there is not currently a show of SOUL NATIVITY's profile celebrating the holidays from an African American standpoint.</p>
<p>Featuring music and dance rooted in the black church, incorporating great American music &amp; dance forms including but not limited too blues, jazz, rock and gospel, Soul Nativity sets itself apart from all the rest. </p>
<p>SOUL NATIVITY aims at nothing less than becoming a signiture annual event, like the tree lighting and Radio City Music Hall Spectacular, a family show for all people, every year.</p>

Nit Thèâtre is creating an exciting new project: a political flash-mob
performance entitled “Coup d’Eclat Xalée Yi.” The project is designed to
protest and raise awareness for the conditions of many Talibé children in Senegal. This
is a grave and pernicious problem: thousands of children, removed from their families
and support structures, are exploited daily and reduced to begging in the
streets of Dakar. </p>

Notre association, en collaboration avec l'organisation Collectif des Structures d’Appui aux Enfants et Jeunes en Difficulté (COSAED) travaille sur un  projet innovant : une performance ‘flash-mob’ qui s’appelle « Coup d’Eclat Xalée Yi. » Le projet est né d’un besoin de donner coup d’alerte fort aux gouvernants, décideurs, et le grand public sur la situation des enfants de la rue en Afrique, et particulièrement au Sénégal. Cette situation est très grave : il y a beaucoup d’enfants, qui sont exploités et qui mendient tout les jours dans les rues de Dakar.



Notre objectif est de rassembler le maximum des personnes  INDIGNÈES (au moins 750 personnes) à la Place de la Nation (Place de l’Obélisque) le 20 Novembre 2015, la Journée Internationale de la Convention Internationale des Droits de l’Enfant, à 18:30h.
 Avec votre participation, nous allons:



Reproduire la forme d’une grande toile d’araignée, en apposant des bandes fluorescentes sur les bras des participants pour obtenir l’image d’une toile d’araignée en éclat après le coucher du soleil.


Créer à l’entrée de la place,  une installation de bonhommes (en pots de tomates et pots de lait vides) pris en piège dans une toile d’araignée- labyrinthe. 

Projeter des vidéos de témoignages, plaidoyers et déclarations sur 6 écrans géants positionnés en arc autour cette toile.


La toile d’araignée est une représentation visuelle de la situation des enfants de la rue (talibés): piégés dans un système qui continue de grandir de jour en jour.




« Coup d’Eclat Xalée Yi » est un projet important pour les enfants du pays et pour le développement du Sénégal. Nous comptons rassembler le maximum de participants pour envoyer un message fort.

Pour le succès
de « Coup d’Eclat Xalèe Yi, » nous avons besoin de récolter $2500 (1,527,400 CFA) afin de couvrir les dépenses liées à la logistique.
Votre soutien
est tres important pour la réalisation de ce projet innovant. Participez
autant que possible, et parlez du « Coup d’Eclat Xalèe Yi » avec vos
amis.
Ce projet a un
grand potentiel, et son impact n’est pas seulement
locale ; nous avons tous la responsabilité de trouver une solution sur le
problème des enfants de la rue.
