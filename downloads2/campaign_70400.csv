<h3>The Campaign and the Impact</h3>
<p>India is moving towards social transformation and the
importance of women equality is rising. There is a growing need to educate
women especially the younger generation that is about to enter the working
environment. We all know the famous adage if we empower a woman, the whole
village is empowered.</p>
<p>The main challenge that women face, particularly those in
semi-rural and rural regions, include:</p>

I’m Kim Roxburgh, founder of Hope Rises−a nonprofit organization assisting women coming out of prison and jail. For the last two years I've been on an exciting journey with a team of determined, compassionate people to see how Hope Rises can best fill a massive gap in services for women transitioning back into our downtown Little Rock community. This journey has taken us into the county jail, prison, halfway houses, and numerous meetings with community members, nonprofit leaders, and local and state government officials. In the beginning, our organization offered only day-program services to recently released women in the Pulaski County Detention Facility and at local halfway houses. However, it became clear that the need for safe housing that provided treatment and structure was desperately needed. Unfortunately, halfway houses have experienced a number of problems that indicate the industry is in need of systemic improvements. </span></h3>
<h2><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>A house is shelter and a basic need. Providing treatment and support in addition to safe housing is exactly what research tells us is needed to reduce the risk of re-incarceration.</b></span></h2>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">And so, the Hope
Rises Wellness and Recovery House idea was formed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our correctional
system offers very little in terms of rehabilitation. For this reason, women
need more than “halfway” in terms of housing and treatment when returning to
the community.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The first six
months to one year following the release from incarceration is a critical time
for women. It can be difficult to not resort back to the “old way of life” when
faced with, what seems like, insurmountable obstacles of gaining full-time
employment, housing, dealing with untreated physical and mental health issues,
reuniting with family, and maintaining sobriety. Often the women we serve do
not have the money to pay for accommodations up front. Hope Rises will give them a ""working grace
period"" while they obtain full-time employment, receive treatment services, and obtain necessary documents. This grace period will keep them out of the shelters and off the streets.</span></p>

Hello! I’m Kim Roxburgh, founder of Hope Rises−a nonprofit organization assisting women coming out of prison and jail. For the last two years I've been on an exciting journey with a team of determined, compassionate people to see how Hope Rises can best fill a massive gap in services for women transitioning back into our downtown Little Rock community. This journey has taken us into the county jail, prison, halfway houses, and numerous meetings with community members, nonprofit leaders, and local and state government officials. In the beginning, our organization offered only day-program services to recently released women in the Pulaski County Detention Facility and at local halfway houses. However, it became clear that the need for safe housing that provided treatment and structure was desperately needed. Unfortunately, halfway houses have experienced a number of problems that indicate the industry is in need of systemic improvements. 
A house is shelter and a basic need. Providing treatment and support in addition to safe housing is exactly what research tells us is needed to reduce the risk of re-incarceration.
And so, the Hope
Rises Wellness and Recovery House idea was formed.
Our correctional
system offers very little in terms of rehabilitation. For this reason, women
need more than “halfway” in terms of housing and treatment when returning to
the community.
The first six
months to one year following the release from incarceration is a critical time
for women. It can be difficult to not resort back to the “old way of life” when
faced with, what seems like, insurmountable obstacles of gaining full-time
employment, housing, dealing with untreated physical and mental health issues,
reuniting with family, and maintaining sobriety. Often the women we serve do
not have the money to pay for accommodations up front. Hope Rises will give them a ""working grace
period"" while they obtain full-time employment, receive treatment services, and obtain necessary documents. This grace period will keep them out of the shelters and off the streets.

We support each
woman in her own unique journey toward transformation. The Hope Rises Wellness
and Recovery House will be""more than halfway"" by providing:

Our 6-month
program is designed to guide women through numerous obstacles and empower them
to take action on their own behalf to meet their physical, spiritual and
emotional needs. This empowerment process allows them to move forward to the
future and remove the stigma of their past identities. Our team and partners
provide the necessary tools, direction, structure, guidance, and support so
that every woman that walks through our door is given the opportunity to
succeed. 
Our goal is to help each woman break the cycle of self-destructive behavior; be accountable; take responsibility for her progress; and, learn to solve problems thus avoiding any future contact with the criminal justice system.
Our approach:

Case Management: Provide support and guidance to clients with
individualized case plans and targeted goals based on a gender-responsive
risk/need/strength assessment.


Substance Abuse Support: Facilitate in-house individual and group
interventions and off-campus meetings for recovery and relapse prevention.


Personal Empowerment and Spiritual Support: Facilitate programming in trauma recovery,
self-esteem building, stress management, decision-making, healthy
relationships, parenting, relationship power, and sexual health. Our
programming offers support groups and guidance in empowerment and spiritual
growth with daily devotionals and meditation.


Economic Empowerment and Social Enterprises: Conduct entrepreneurship training,
mentorship, social enterprise opportunities, and work readiness training. We've
created a small social enterprise opportunity to fulfill our mission, generate
revenue, and create social and economic opportunities for our program
participants.

Health and Wellness: Conduct individualized health assessments
plus preventive education addressing negative health behaviors and chronic
diseases. Our programming includes instruction on healthy eating, cooking
healthy on a budget, and urban gardening skills.


Physical Activity:  Teach
individual and organized physical activity such as yoga, running, walking,
cycling, high-intensity/short duration workouts, and more.



Hope Rises is a
501(c)3 nonprofit founded in 2013 in Little Rock, Arkansas. 
Our mission is to provide holistic services to incarcerated and previously incarcerated women to improve their health and wellbeing and provide opportunities for personal growth and empowerment.
We currently offer
programming to women incarcerated in the Pulaski County Detention Facility. The
Hope Rises team is comprised of public health practitioners, a social worker, a
health and wellness physician, entrepreneurs, financial manager, and nurses.
 The funds raised
from this campaign will be used to finance the opening of our wellness and
recovery house. Our goal for the next 60 days is to raise $5,000. This will
allow us to pay the initial leasing fees for the facility, make necessary
modifications, and purchase the equipment and supplies needed. No donation is
too small and there are several ways to give:


Make a donation on this site and receive a donation ""perk""
Visit our website at hoperises.org and set up a recurring monthly donation. Recurring donations are a great way to give. Even a donation as small a $10/month can make an impact.

form of perks, the donation in excess of the perk value could be
tax-deductible. If we don't reach our $5,000 goal, the ""Flexible

<p>This fundraising campaign's purpose is to raise the money to finish the interior part of the greenhouse build.  An additional $20,000 is needed to finish the project.  This project is very important to me not only so I can support my household, but also because it's something I love and believe in. This method of farming brings an awareness of chemical free, sustainable farming to the community and beyond.  I plan to provide tours of the farm for the local schools and colleges to spread the word.  <br/></p>
<p>Only with your help will I be able to realize my dream of sustainable farming.  As we all know, traditional ways of farming are not as efficient as they could be.   I am trying to do my part in progressive farming practices, as I believe it is the best way we can all live with nature on our little planet!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> There is much to be done to get the farm up and running.  The first task after completion of the fundraising campaign would be to order and build the remaining equipment needed to run the operation.  The equipment needed is vast, such as a temperature controlled venting system for green house (GH), retractable shade cloth for the GH, both the main and the backup water pumps for the ""deep water system"" and ""media beds"", secondary water pumps for the ""vertical towers"" and the ""nutrient film technology(NFT) systems, air pumps (for oxygenation), 1500 gal. food grade fish tank, a 500 gal. and a 250 gal. filter tank, degassing tank, the materials to build the deep water troughs, media beds, vertical towers, and NFT system (wood, liners, insulation, hardware, epoxy's, etc.) nursery (for starting young seeds/plants), walk-in refrigerated cooler, electrical, plumbing, and aeration materials.  As you can see the list is long and costly and that is why I need your help to get to the finish line.</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>You can learn more details about the perks of being a contributor over in the perks section, where I'm offering apparel such as shirts, a hat, and merchandise like water bottles, totes, charging cables, and insulated lunch bags.  For higher levels of contribution, I'm even willing to name the greenhouse after you, or put your name on a special plaque that I'll hang in the greenhouse, honoring you as a supporter of sustainable farming!  It will be a highlight of my farm tours!</span></div><div>

<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Problems and hurdles come with the territory when it comes to running a farming operation, and those issues will be overcome.  The support that is out there for me to take full advantage of gives me strong confidence in my success.  I completed a commercial aquaponic farming training course and have the support and backing from the course's instructors and organization.  There also exists a coalition of Aquaponic Farmers in the North Carolina region that I will join and utilize as another powerful resource.  I have gardened my whole life, growing, canning, and freezing my produce.  This has allowed me to feed my family (and some friends!), some of the highest quality vegetables and fruits.  I am ready for the challenges that await!</p>

The Impact We believe this project is very valuable, not only in creating a new business in the community, but also changing the way America and the World farms.  The system is a ""closed"" system that does not create any type of pollutants (it cleans itself using natures natural life cycles).  This method of farming is being implemented in arid countries around the world, due to the way water is conserved (water is not wasted through percolation or evaporation).  Aquaponic farming typically uses between 5 and 10 percent of the water needed in traditional farming.

    Risks & Challenges Problems and hurdles come with the territory when it comes to running a farming operation, and those issues will be overcome.  The support that is out there for me to take full advantage of gives me strong confidence in my success.  I completed a commercial aquaponic farming training course and have the support and backing from the course's instructors and organization.  There also exists a coalition of Aquaponic Farmers in the North Carolina region that I will join and utilize as another powerful resource.  I have gardened my whole life, growing, canning, and freezing my produce.  This has allowed me to feed my family (and some friends!), some of the highest quality vegetables and fruits.  I am ready for the challenges that await!
   Other Ways You Can Help I know there are some of you that just can't afford to help out with a donation.  You still can be a huge help.  If you believe this is a viable and worthwhile en devour, PLEASE get the word out to others that may!  There are social media sharing links/button here on this Indiegogo campaign page that you can use to spread the word via Facebook, Twitter, Google+, email and more, at the click of a button. Using those tools will help me out a whole lot, too, so thank you for any voice you can lend to the effort.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<i>The Passion and Intention</i><br/>
</h3>
<p>Mary Paulson and Surinder Goode's personal missions are to begin a
new journey within  San Diego community's craft breweries, wineries and ciders,
to become one of the leading cider-makers, and utilizing their status as an
advocate and volunteer for dog rescues, primarily with Labradors and Friends Dog
Rescue Group by donating a 10% portion of profits from hard ciders to animal rescue charities.</p>

<p>Mary's business and life philosophy
stems from a core belief in possibilities, and in believing that
whatever you set your heart and mind out to do in life, you will accomplish
your goals. She has proven this to be true by following her passions. First, as
a touring and recording artist with two
albums, then as a fire fighter retiring after 26 years of service, and as a LPGA Class A Golf Professional,  she has accomplished all
of her past career goals.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Knowing that when one journey ends,
another begins with new goals, new dreams, and new possibilities waiting to be
challenged and fulfilled. In 2015, Mary found her life transitioning towards
focusing on cider-making and volunteer work.
Now her passion is to create great tasting hard cider, volunteer to foster
rescue Labrador mixed dogs, and to become an active participant in her community in
the North Park district of San Diego, CA.</p>

<p>At the age of 50, all of Mary's past hard work took a toll,  her past injuries caught up to her, and health issues became a priority. It was
time to take a time out and care for herself for a bit. Mary found herself in physical therapy for 11 months working on all her injuries and starting a new hobby making hard cider.<span> She shared and tested each new recipe and flavor with her PT doctor and massage therapist until each flavor was perfect!   Now her focus has
become fostering Labradors, rehabilitating from her injuries, and making hard ciders subsequently naming it, Poochie's Hooch!</span><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465582122/IMG_20150815_091112647_u1ehbe.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 374.46px;height: 211px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span>
<p><span></span>Poochie's Hooch is named after a foster Labrador mix dog named
Poochie. She came to the rescue group as half of a senior bonded pair. Today, sadly, her mate, Spot, has passed on and Poochie is now 11 years old, alone, and most likely will
never be adopted. She will be considered a ""Foster Failure"".  Mary
and her business partner, Surinder, plan to give 10% net profits to Labradors &amp; Friends Dog Rescue each year
as a business charity, specifically to aid special funding for medical aid, medications, food and bedding for senior dogs.                                                                                                                             </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463957858/Canelo_2_sx5eat.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 142.39px;height: 222px;""/>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465582265/Branding_logo_3in_cvrvox.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 182.41px;height: 181px;""/>        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464118762/Girls_hanging_outside_toogether_exyzs1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 207.05px;height: 220px;""/><br/></p>
<b><br/>This will be a contribution that will continue to give help to those in need.</b><br/>
<p>These two hard working women guarantee that the money funded to aid in start- up costs
for Poochie's Hooch Urban Cidery will be used tenfold for years to come in paying forward
and giving to charities for animal rights, and specifically caring for senior
dogs who are dumped in shelters by their ""families"" because they are
too old or sick; moving away without them, or just don't want to be responsible for their pet any
more. Rescue groups, like Labradors and Friends, pull these dogs out of High
Kill Shelters and give them help, dignity, and hopefully, new loving families
and homes every day. In 2015, LAFDR rescued 401 dogs in need.  But in the cases like Poochie, which are many, they are held in
boarding facilities, or hopefully a loving foster home until they are adopted, or sadly cross over the rainbow bridge in loving arms. <br/></p>

<p>Surinder Goode has spent her entire career in the food
and beverage industry. </p>
<p>In 1988 Surinder joined Harlequin Leisure Group as a
manager of a chain of Indian restaurants in Scotland. From menu planning, décor, to hiring and training
employees Surinder’s job encompassed all aspects of the restaurant industry.  In 1991, Surinder moved to the Middle East operating on
board private flights for His Royal Highness. Traveling the world and expanding
her knowledge of food and wines, she became involved in catering to an elite
clientele. </p>
<p>After moving to San Diego, despite reaching corporate goals, in 2002,
Surinder challenged herself by opening her first coffee kiosk to a demographic
of disciplined, hardworking, patriotic individuals ... the U.S.
Military ... a demographic that had not been catered to.</p>
<p>“After several months of operating,
one of my dearest customers paid me a tremendous business compliment by saying,
“Your coffee cart is known as the ‘water cooler’ on base”.  The “Water Cooler”
became the model for business.<br/></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><i><b><br/></b></i></p>
<p><i><b>LOSE THE POOCH, DRINK SOME HOOCH</b></i></p>
<i><b></b></i><p><i><b>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463957485/Bumper_Sticker_sifchm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 300.41px;height: 86px;""/> </b></i></p>
<p>Mary created a healthy formula for her hard cider only
containing 8 grams of carbohydrates and 8 grams of sugar with 280 cal in 16oz servings at 7.35% abv. To say she was pleased with these laboratory results would be an understatement, since most commercial hard ciders on the market today contain 19-26 grams of sugar in 12 oz. servings!  Poochie's Hooch is easy on the tummy and oh so yummy, because sugar-minded people are able to drink several servings without feeling any after-affects the next morning!<br/></p>
<span>Using only natural and
organic ingredients, it quickly became clear that this cider was special! The
light, crisp, low sugar beverage was becoming a favorite at social events,
parties, and get-togethers with friends and neighbors. The perfect alcoholic beverage at a Renaissance themed wedding.... Spiced Apple and Jaded Apple!<br/></span>     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463374853/Promodrinks_cbjdvg.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 498.4px;height: 243px;""/><br/>
<p>With 20 different flavored hard ciders, the feedback Mary continued to receive
about her hooch from friends, neighbors, strangers, professional wine
tasters and brew masters all told her to take her product to the commercial
level with no reservations.<span>  Open a cider
house. Thus creating The Cider House, LLC    DBA Poochie's Hooch Urban Cidery.<br/></span></p>
<p><span> ""The Apple Mojito is amazing! Perfect to sip on a hot summer day or evening."" <br/></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Quoting <a href=""http://www.seattletimes.com/pacific-nw-magazine/washington-winemaker-blazes-new-trails-in-craft-distilling/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rusty Figgins</a>, ""Keep the Pumpkin Spice on tap year round. They will come back for this cider.""<br/></span></p>
<p><span>That was enough for Mary to follow yet another journey towards yet
another soon to be successful goal... Poochie's Hooch Urban Cidery. <br/></span></p>
<p><span>The cidery will be located within the North Park District in San Diego, known as the Craft Brewery Mecca in the United States. Poochie's Hooch Urban Cidery will be the first cider house, not only among the high density craft breweries in North Park, but also in the entire city of San Diego. Those looking for something different other than beer while touring North Park establishments will now have Poochie's Hooch hard cider to enjoy!  This business is set up for success! Great product, Great location, Great successful business owners, and great passion for charity and community!<br/></span></p>
<p>To
quote Mary's past golf coaches and anyone who has worked with her on any
project, ""Action"" is the one word to describe Mary Paulson. She does
what she says she's going to do. She walks the walk, and talks the talk. With
all of her high goals and aspirations, she has never given up and always saw
each project to the end of every journey successfully meeting her goals. Poochie's Hooch will be yet another successful journey for decades to come.</p>
<i><b><br/>What We Need &amp; What We Are Asking</b></i>
</div><div>Mary and her business partner, Surinder, who has over 15 years owning and operating her current beverage business, are currently asking aid for $75,000 to help attain a location lease and order the fermenting equipment, in order to begin the Application process for Licenses and Permits, and ultimately,  to open a hard cider manufacturing business.  With the initial intent to start selling through a tasting room and manufacturing 520 barrels annually, then using annual profits to expand and open two more Tap rooms across southern California.  Opening an alcoholic manufacturing business comes with more red tape and paperwork at the Federal, State, and Local governmental levels than most new small businesses. Costs for legal fees and hiring Attorneys who specialize in the Wine/Cider/Craft brewery will cost $10-20k. Taxes, Insurance, Licensing and permits, and professional fees will cost $50k.  $100k will be spent on purchasing manufacturing equipment and supplies for a 20 Barrel fermenting system, building a customized cooling system, shipping and installing the system with professional  training by the manufacturing company; and  preparing the Cidery building itself for the fermenting tanks to meet regulations IE: Floor drains, cement weight-load platforms, electrical, plumbing, and Installing walk-in coolers and a freezer, will estimate a cost $30k. Our total Start up/Capital needs will be $200,000. But your help will keep the movement towards opening scheduled by March 2017, if not sooner.<br/><br/>In summary, The funding we are asking for will be utilized to get the actual Cidery up and running and producing, along with furnishing the tasting room and setting up a tap system for 10 flavors of cider available at one time year round. Because of the red tape in receiving licenses and permits from Fed/State/local governments, the most expensive cost will be Property lease and utilities. It will take at least 6 months from the time of the Federal TTB application process has started, 3 months for the fermenting equipment to be manufactured, 2-3 months for State ABC winegrowers permits to be approved, and a month and a day to make a batch of hooch until we can open for business. Yet another reason why many home cider-makers do not commercialize. You must have an address and location in the TTB application for wine manufacturing, as well as, show paperwork that the fermenting equipment is on order. This alone will cost approximately $100k for paying 6 months lease with a deposit and ordering equipment..<br/><br/><b>So what do we get out of it?</b> $200k to show the Realtor, equipment manufacturer, and government entities we have enough funds in the bank to lease the property location we know we want within the craft brewery district of North Park, and to show TTB we are prepared to move forward to manufacture hard ciders. This will allow us to move forward with the rest of the business preparations by hiring contractors and professionals for building construction, permits, legal aid, etc. And to begin creating jobs in our community by hiring workers for the tasting room and Assistant cider makers.<br/> <p></p>

<p>Reaching our goal would be tremendous. But even if we only receive half of our needs, that still allows us to get the ball rolling. We can get into our building, get our applications sent in, get our manufacturing equipment ordered, and that will give us 6 months to find more funds to hire attorneys for unforeseen issues, And get the tasting room constructed and ready for a grand opening.<br/></p>

I know I can do a lot of good for others who help needy animals every day. I got lucky and began making an incredible hard cider! The cidery alone will be a success because there are NO cider houses among the craft breweries in the North Park brewery district. There will be zero competition. A No-Brainer for this location and market.  Your money will help us to make hard cider, so that we can pay it forward and help the non-profit charities who help those tossed and dumped beautiful animals, and hopefully connect them with new loving families.  Thank you for allowing me to share Poochie's story, and explain why I'm so passionate about opening our urban cidery in San Diego.<br/>Mary~<br/><ul></ul> </div><p><br/></p><br/></div>","Help Us Support Dog Rescue Groups Today

Senior Bonded-Pair Spot and Poochie:  Picture taken just after being dropped off by their family at a High Kill Shelter in Los Angeles ages 8 and 10.by Fusaro Photography


                
At the age of 50, all of Mary's past hard work took a toll,  her past injuries caught up to her, and health issues became a priority. It was
time to take a time out and care for herself for a bit. Mary found herself in physical therapy for 11 months working on all her injuries and starting a new hobby making hard cider. She shared and tested each new recipe and flavor with her PT doctor and massage therapist until each flavor was perfect!   Now her focus has
become fostering Labradors, rehabilitating from her injuries, and making hard ciders subsequently naming it, Poochie's Hooch!

                          


Poochie's Hooch is named after a foster Labrador mix dog named
Poochie. She came to the rescue group as half of a senior bonded pair. Today, sadly, her mate, Spot, has passed on and Poochie is now 11 years old, alone, and most likely will
never be adopted. She will be considered a ""Foster Failure"".  Mary
and her business partner, Surinder, plan to give 10% net profits to Labradors & Friends Dog Rescue each year
as a business charity, specifically to aid special funding for medical aid, medications, food and bedding for senior dogs.                                                                                                                             
              
This will be a contribution that will continue to give help to those in need.
These two hard working women guarantee that the money funded to aid in start- up costs
for Poochie's Hooch Urban Cidery will be used tenfold for years to come in paying forward
and giving to charities for animal rights, and specifically caring for senior
dogs who are dumped in shelters by their ""families"" because they are
too old or sick; moving away without them, or just don't want to be responsible for their pet any
more. Rescue groups, like Labradors and Friends, pull these dogs out of High
Kill Shelters and give them help, dignity, and hopefully, new loving families
and homes every day. In 2015, LAFDR rescued 401 dogs in need.  But in the cases like Poochie, which are many, they are held in
boarding facilities, or hopefully a loving foster home until they are adopted, or sadly cross over the rainbow bridge in loving arms. 

                               



Surinder Goode has spent her entire career in the food
and beverage industry. 
In 1988 Surinder joined Harlequin Leisure Group as a
manager of a chain of Indian restaurants in Scotland. From menu planning, décor, to hiring and training
employees Surinder’s job encompassed all aspects of the restaurant industry.  In 1991, Surinder moved to the Middle East operating on
board private flights for His Royal Highness. Traveling the world and expanding
her knowledge of food and wines, she became involved in catering to an elite
clientele. 
After moving to San Diego, despite reaching corporate goals, in 2002,
Surinder challenged herself by opening her first coffee kiosk to a demographic
of disciplined, hardworking, patriotic individuals ... the U.S.
Military ... a demographic that had not been catered to.
“After several months of operating,
one of my dearest customers paid me a tremendous business compliment by saying,
“Your coffee cart is known as the ‘water cooler’ on base”.  The “Water Cooler”
became the model for business.


LOSE THE POOCH, DRINK SOME HOOCH
     
Mary created a healthy formula for her hard cider only
containing 8 grams of carbohydrates and 8 grams of sugar with 280 cal in 16oz servings at 7.35% abv. To say she was pleased with these laboratory results would be an understatement, since most commercial hard ciders on the market today contain 19-26 grams of sugar in 12 oz. servings!  Poochie's Hooch is easy on the tummy and oh so yummy, because sugar-minded people are able to drink several servings without feeling any after-affects the next morning!
Using only natural and
organic ingredients, it quickly became clear that this cider was special! The
light, crisp, low sugar beverage was becoming a favorite at social events,
parties, and get-togethers with friends and neighbors. The perfect alcoholic beverage at a Renaissance themed wedding.... Spiced Apple and Jaded Apple!     
With 20 different flavored hard ciders, the feedback Mary continued to receive
about her hooch from friends, neighbors, strangers, professional wine
tasters and brew masters all told her to take her product to the commercial
level with no reservations.  Open a cider
house. Thus creating The Cider House, LLC    DBA Poochie's Hooch Urban Cidery.
 ""The Apple Mojito is amazing! Perfect to sip on a hot summer day or evening."" 
Quoting Rusty Figgins, ""Keep the Pumpkin Spice on tap year round. They will come back for this cider.""
That was enough for Mary to follow yet another journey towards yet
another soon to be successful goal... Poochie's Hooch Urban Cidery. 
The cidery will be located within the North Park District in San Diego, known as the Craft Brewery Mecca in the United States. Poochie's Hooch Urban Cidery will be the first cider house, not only among the high density craft breweries in North Park, but also in the entire city of San Diego. Those looking for something different other than beer while touring North Park establishments will now have Poochie's Hooch hard cider to enjoy!  This business is set up for success! Great product, Great location, Great successful business owners, and great passion for charity and community!
To
quote Mary's past golf coaches and anyone who has worked with her on any
project, ""Action"" is the one word to describe Mary Paulson. She does
what she says she's going to do. She walks the walk, and talks the talk. With
all of her high goals and aspirations, she has never given up and always saw
each project to the end of every journey successfully meeting her goals. Poochie's Hooch will be yet another successful journey for decades to come.
What We Need & What We Are Asking
Mary and her business partner, Surinder, who has over 15 years owning and operating her current beverage business, are currently asking aid for $75,000 to help attain a location lease and order the fermenting equipment, in order to begin the Application process for Licenses and Permits, and ultimately,  to open a hard cider manufacturing business.  With the initial intent to start selling through a tasting room and manufacturing 520 barrels annually, then using annual profits to expand and open two more Tap rooms across southern California.  Opening an alcoholic manufacturing business comes with more red tape and paperwork at the Federal, State, and Local governmental levels than most new small businesses. Costs for legal fees and hiring Attorneys who specialize in the Wine/Cider/Craft brewery will cost $10-20k. Taxes, Insurance, Licensing and permits, and professional fees will cost $50k.  $100k will be spent on purchasing manufacturing equipment and supplies for a 20 Barrel fermenting system, building a customized cooling system, shipping and installing the system with professional  training by the manufacturing company; and  preparing the Cidery building itself for the fermenting tanks to meet regulations IE: Floor drains, cement weight-load platforms, electrical, plumbing, and Installing walk-in coolers and a freezer, will estimate a cost $30k. Our total Start up/Capital needs will be $200,000. But your help will keep the movement towards opening scheduled by March 2017, if not sooner.In summary, The funding we are asking for will be utilized to get the actual Cidery up and running and producing, along with furnishing the tasting room and setting up a tap system for 10 flavors of cider available at one time year round. Because of the red tape in receiving licenses and permits from Fed/State/local governments, the most expensive cost will be Property lease and utilities. It will take at least 6 months from the time of the Federal TTB application process has started, 3 months for the fermenting equipment to be manufactured, 2-3 months for State ABC winegrowers permits to be approved, and a month and a day to make a batch of hooch until we can open for business. Yet another reason why many home cider-makers do not commercialize. You must have an address and location in the TTB application for wine manufacturing, as well as, show paperwork that the fermenting equipment is on order. This alone will cost approximately $100k for paying 6 months lease with a deposit and ordering equipment..So what do we get out of it? $200k to show the Realtor, equipment manufacturer, and government entities we have enough funds in the bank to lease the property location we know we want within the craft brewery district of North Park, and to show TTB we are prepared to move forward to manufacture hard ciders. This will allow us to move forward with the rest of the business preparations by hiring contractors and professionals for building construction, permits, legal aid, etc. And to begin creating jobs in our community by hiring workers for the tasting room and Assistant cider makers. 
                        
What do you get out of it? Aside from the perks we will offer for smaller contributions, we are also in a position to negotiate with donors offering $50k+. This will be discussed privately, and those seriously interested in higher propositions may contact us for the Secret Perks and will be sent to you. We are truly looking for a win-win-win situation. We want the rescued and non-rescued dogs to win, we obviously want our new Urban Cidery to win, and for believing in our cause, our passion, Mary's great natural pallet and cider making skills, and our sense of adventure we want you, the donors, to win too!  Whether it be a logo cap or branded flight board with glasses; a CD of Mary Paulson or a Private Professional Golf lesson;         A Private Personal Training session with  Surinder.  A Private Tasting Party with your friends, or having your name recognized on the ""Poochie"" wall as a contributor for Dog Rescues; a good karma sticker, or just a heart-felt and grateful Thank You, knowing your contribution will be a gift that will continue to give and grow.  We want you to feel as much passion as we do to serve our community and help animal rights.               
Reaching our goal would be tremendous. But even if we only receive half of our needs, that still allows us to get the ball rolling. We can get into our building, get our applications sent in, get our manufacturing equipment ordered, and that will give us 6 months to find more funds to hire attorneys for unforeseen issues, And get the tasting room constructed and ready for a grand opening.

   
                   CHEERS!   
 Note from Mary:As a retired firefighter, I have been looking to reinvent myself; to feel needed and a part of the community again. I want to help. I know I can do a lot of good for others who help needy animals every day. I got lucky and began making an incredible hard cider! The cidery alone will be a success because there are NO cider houses among the craft breweries in the North Park brewery district. There will be zero competition. A No-Brainer for this location and market.  Your money will help us to make hard cider, so that we can pay it forward and help the non-profit charities who help those tossed and dumped beautiful animals, and hopefully connect them with new loving families.  Thank you for allowing me to share Poochie's story, and explain why I'm so passionate about opening our urban cidery in San Diego.Mary~",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi! I’m Belen, I'm Argentinian, but I live in Arequipa (Peru) since 6 years ago. I am married and we have three children, Máximo, Francisco and Clara, and I’m proofreader.</p>
<h2>I have a dream</h2>
<p>Open a Bookstore coffee shop and cultural meeting place. But before going into details, I tell you that Arequipa is surrounded by 3 volcanoes; it has a spring weather for 9 consecutive months in the year; it is a city with an estimated population of 1 million; big, right? But it still has a detail, in this city so populated there is not even a single bookstore-coffee. This means that there is no one place where you can choose a book and drink a coffee, where you can relax and have a good time, and where can also fill you with other things that enrich your soul.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>I want people to not only have the possibility of buying a book, but also that this place were a cultural site that contribute to the society, Peruvians and the large number of foreigners who visit the city throughout the year. Here there will be story-telling, book presentations, live relaxing music, comic books workshops, reading clubs. It will be a place for practicing book crossing. At the same time, those people who do not have enough money, can take second hand books at very low cost or join book crossing. In this bookstore, readers will be able to recommend books to others in a specific site for it.</p>
<p>It will be a great place where we will all be enriched!</p>
<h2><strong>You can take part!</strong></h2>
<p>Now, to achieve this I need your help. These are the expenses that I must to cover in order to avoid getting into debt so much at the beginning:</p>
<ul>
<li>$18,200 to cover the rent of the premises for a time.</li>
<li>$5,000 to condition the premises and make it as beautiful as posible.</li>
<li>$6,000 for furniture and decoration.</li>
<li>$30,000 for books.</li>
<li>$40,800 to cover extra expenses: shelves and booksellers; tableware and initial supplies; municipal licenses; signs; professional services; Indiegogo (8% of funds raised —including platform and credit card charges— + 30 cents per contribution); cost of perks + shipping (included in the perk cost).</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus I need $100,000. I know it's a lot of money but I'm sure you'll love the project, and when you visit this beautiful city, you will can see it came true!</p>
<h2><strong>Perks</strong></h2>
<p>Now, if you help me, you will receive in return:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>For contributions of $10</strong>: Special thanks by email + an eternal gratitude.</li>
<li>
<strong>For contributions of $25</strong>: A postcard of Arequipa city + an eternal gratitude.</li>
<li>
<strong>For contributions of $50</strong>: A watercolor painting of some landscape of the city made by a Peruvian artist (5,90’’ x 2,36’’ approx.) + an eternal gratitude.</li>
<li>
<strong>For the contributions of $75</strong>: The two previous perks + an eternal gratitude.</li>
<li>
<strong>For contributions of $100</strong>: A watercolor painting of some city landscape made by a Peruvian artist (5,11’’ x 7,08’’ approx.) + an eternal gratitude.</li>
<li>
<strong>For the contributions of $250</strong>: A book of the Nobel Prize Mario Vargas Llosa + an eternal gratitude.</li>
<li>

</ul>

Instantly, the two families became inseparable until this past May when Kathy’s husband Marcus unexpectantly passed away due to the onset of a brain aneurysm.Soon after his passing, Kathy and the girls moved to Ohio to live closer to Marcus’s family.

<h3>The Story.</h3>
<p>Neil Gaiman says in his book <i>American Gods:</i><strong> “…</strong>a town isn’t a town without a bookstore. It may call itself a town, but unless it’s got a bookstore, it knows it’s not foolin’ a soul.” This is absolutely true – bookstores offer joy and knowledge, nurture imaginations and creativity, and bring people and ideas together. They build community.</p>
<p>And there was a good chance that Vallejo was going to lose its only one.</p>
<p>But when the owner of the Vallejo Bookstore contacted me and told me she wanted to sell and asked if I would be interested in buying it, my first reaction was, “Yes!” Ever since I was a teenager it has been my dream to own my own bookstore, especially after working in the book business for nearly 30 years, first as a bookseller, and for the past 15 years in sales for Lonely Planet and Chronicle Books. But because of that experience, I did think long and hard about it. I’ve watched the book industry change, from independents to chain stores to superstores to internet to the “death of the book” to “books are making a comeback” to everything in between. But one thing has stayed consistent: me. I love books, I love reading, I love talking about books, I love recommending books, I love selling books, I love independent bookstores. Even after all that thinking and weighing it all out, I still said, “Yes!” This is what I’ve always wanted to do, and what I believe in.</p>
<p>I also believe in Vallejo, California, which is about 30 miles north of San Francisco and the 10th most populated city in The Bay Area. It declared bankruptcy in 2008, but has been on the upswing and continues to see positive changes. Buying the bookstore is an opportunity to keep a business downtown. And like Neil Gaiman said, a town isn’t a town without a bookstore, and I don’t want Vallejo to lose ours; I want Vallejo to continue to have a bookstore to serve our community as a thriving business with events, readings, story times for kids, and, of course, books! Mostly I want it to be a place for people to meet, to share, and be welcoming for all. I think Alibi Bookshop will be a terrific asset for Vallejo, especially downtown, and I think I am the right person to do this and make a positive impact for our city.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>My goal to get going is $30,000, which sounds like a lot (and it is!) but it is actually quite conservative. There are many things to consider and it will be used for the following: start-up costs (business license, DBA, resale certificate paperwork processing; LLC and ABA membership fees; insurance; utilities; deposits) POS upgrade, signage, fixtures (bookshelves; tables; display items; furniture; office desk), marketing (materials and online), floor and window repair, supplies, and most of all, inventory and merchandise. Though it will continue to be primarily used books, I do want to bring in popular new titles, requested favorites, gifts and sidelines, and need to establish credit with distributors and publishers.</p>
<p>Since I’ve been in the book business for all these years, I’m not exactly wealthy so I need financial assistance. Believe me, it’s not easy for me to do this, but I am such a strong believer in independent bookstores, my town, and fellow readers, that I’m swallowing my pride and asking for your help. It’s going to be a lot of work and will take a village, but I know the end result is going to be rewarding for all of us. And the perks will be especially rewarding for you -- check them out! Click on the sidebar to the right to see what each of them include.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks, Challenges, and Impact</h3>
<p>I know in this day and age of Amazon and big box stores, buying a small business – especially a brick and mortar bookstore – is risky. But print book sales are up and independent bookstores have been thriving for the past few years – there are now over 2300 in the US. (Take a look at all these articles: <a href=""https://www.bookweb.org/for-the-record"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.bookweb.org/for-the-record</a> …and look what’s anchoring downtowns! <a href=""https://commonwealthmagazine.org/economy/guess-whats-anchoring-many-small-downtowns/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://commonwealthmagazine.org/economy/guess-whats-anchoring-many-small-downtowns/</a>) And as someone who has been working in publishing for the past 16 years, I have seen firsthand the power, enthusiasm, and success of these independent bookstores and their dedicated owners and staff, and I’m thrilled to be joining their ranks. Also, the Shop Local movement is gaining more and more momentum -- people are starting to understand that the money that is spent in local stores gives back to the community. Shopping online isn’t going to help your town as much as shopping in your local businesses does. And we give people what online retailers can’t: real human connection, thoughtful recommendations instead of algorithms, and experience. They may discount deeply, but what we offer is priceless.</p>
<p>Downtown Vallejo is another risk, but I think it won’t be for long. As of now, there are empty storefronts, and not a lot of regular foot traffic. However, there is The Vallejo Artwalk on the 2nd Friday evening of the month, and every Saturday there is a popular and fantastic farmer’s market, and more businesses are starting to move in. The beautiful Empress Theater is around the corner, as is Provisions, one of the most delicious restaurants in The Bay Area. Across the street is Spruce, what started as a pop-up shop on the holidays, and has been so successful that they signed a lease! I also want to open on Sundays so that the store is a destination for events and shopping. I feel that by keeping the bookstore in business will help inspire more businesses to continue moving in, too, and it will continue to help our economy. Vallejo residents have a fierce pride in their city, and want downtown to thrive. By keeping the bookstore open, we can do just that.</p>
<p>So it may be risky to buy a small bookstore, but I know what I will be giving back to Vallejo and the Bay Area will mitigate those risks and be a success. We’re definitely in for a lot of hard work. (No sitting around reading with a cat on my lap!) I will be keeping my job and working at the store on weekends, and finding staff for the rest of the week. My husband (who is in 1000%!) will be helping out, too, and doing the accounting. There’s a lot of set-up and buying and planning and marketing and brainstorming and hosting and selling to do, and I CANNOT WAIT. The amount of support I’ve received since announcing my plan has been overwhelmingly positive, and I know I’m doing the right thing to make this happen – right by Vallejo and its people, and right in making my bookstore dream come true. As my friend of 30 years said when I told her, “You were born to do this.” I was!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>About Us... And the Store</h3>
<p>I’ve lived in The Bay Area for nearly my whole life, and moved to Vallejo a few years ago. My first job was in a bookstore; my last job will be, too. Since that first job I’ve also worked in Publishing (and at a vintage clothing store, where I learned a lot about small business), and have an MFA in Creative Writing. I have more books than I will ever read, and like it that way. I’ve been married to my husband, Jon, for 6 years (together for 15) – he’s an accountant who loves records as much as I love books. I have two lovely stepchildren of whom I am so proud, and two tiny dogs named Dorothy Parker and Dino Martina who have more Instagram followers than I do.</p>
<p>The Vallejo Bookstore was originally started in 2014 by Dave Tilton and Dariece Warren who purchased it from Rar Farmer, and then sold it to Shannon Moore-Hartlep in 2017. Shannon has done an amazing job – she moved it to the space it’s in now, and has built a regular base of customers who will miss her so much. But Shannon is moving on to pursue her dreams, and giving me the chance to fulfill mine.</p>
<p>Shannon and I agreed that changing the name was a good idea and symbolic for a new start. I struggled coming up with something – what could be better than “Vallejo Bookstore”? – but a friend pointed me to this article: <a href=""https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-alibi-clock-vallejo-california"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-alibi-c...</a> and I knew that was it. The Alibi Clock, which I love, is just around the corner from the store on Georgia Street. It has a fascinating history, and is a nod to Vallejo. It’s perfect!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t donate financially, I understand! But if you have any books that no longer spark joy for you (but will for someone else) and are in resalable condition – no broken spines, discarded library books, writing, rips, or tears – I will happily take them. Eventually I hope to start a Buy/Sell/Trade program, but have to get going first.</p>
<p>Other ways to help – please share this far and wide! Tell your friends! Follow Alibi Bookshop on Facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/alibibookshop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/alibibookshop</a> and Instagram <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/alibibookshop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/alibibookshop/</a> and most of all, come in and shop – often! And if you need a book, contact us and we can order it for you.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all your support. I truly appreciate it. Looking forward to seeing you at Alibi Bookshop!</p>

<h3>Welcome to What Entertainment was Meant to Be!</h3>
<p>When my wife and I moved to Northern Arizona in 2013, we were struck by the sheer lack of entertainment options. With 80,000 residents and nearly 3 million tourists annually, the Verde Valley is in great need of family friendly options for evening entertainment. Given our community, one of the things I considered soon went from thought to dream: a classic drive-in theater experience!</p>
<p>The Verde Drive-In's vision is to recapture what entertainment was meant to be. The Verde Drive-In will develop to a multi-screen drive-in theater that capitalizes on our beautiful landscape. The temperate climate allows for more than 9 months of outdoor operation. During our first few years of operation, we will show classic and family films. We will build up capital reserves in order purchase the equipment that can show New Releases. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573496882/ewknhccnuivglo5tyejf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To prepare the local market, the Verde Drive-In will operate as a pop-up and mobile theater as a minimum viable product. We will partner with local establishments to secure space and will offer food trucks with high quality and traditional fare. The pop-up will allow the Verde Drive-In to gain local support while keeping expenses low allowing us to grow and stabilize while continuing to secure funding for the next phase. </p>
<div>
<h3>What Sets Us Apart</h3>
<p>Verde Drive-In has a distinct competitive edge in that it is the only movie theater within 20 miles of our target location and the only Drive-In throughout Northern Arizona. Other community organizations with outdoor movies do not pose a threat because they have a limited run, target a specific audience, and moviegoers do not sit in their vehicles which exposes them to the weather and insects. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573497558/md8tto2tmjd66zsizpis.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Competition for movie theaters comes in a number of different forms. In general you could describe the indirect competition as any entertainment alternative in the local area, however all local entertainment other than movie theaters will be seen as an ally in creating a family friendly entertainment destination here in the Verde Valley.</p>
<p>Verde Drive-In will differentiate itself from its competitors by creating a family friendly entertainment experience. Research of Drive-Ins across the country have shown that implementing theme nights or limited-run series, as well as photo booths, food trucks, and additional entertainment options have proven successful in creating a quality entertainment experience.</p>
<p>Our advantage is also the beneficial climate which results in an extended season. The weather in the Verde Valley allows for at least 9 months of operation. This will ensure that the Drive-In experience remains attractive and enjoyable to customers.</p>
<p>Drive-In theaters are opening across the country as 'Retro' is coming back. We will capitalize on the nostalgia the Baby Boomer generation has towards Drive-In theaters. To aid in the Classic / Retro experience, we will show classics and 2nd run films at the Verde Pop-Up.</p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Verde Pop-Up will attract traditional movie-going customers and those that enjoy classics from the 1940’s to 1990’s. We will operate in a portable pop-up model greatly reducing start-up costs. This will create a more sustainable model because our mobile equipment will keep initial operating expenses low and allows us to test out new locations at minimal cost while building market penetration.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish this pop-up model, we are seeking funding for the following initial investments:</p>
<ul>
<li>$25,000 - Equipment purchase:  inflatable screen, mobile projector, speakers, FM transmitter, and more</li>
<li>$10,000 - Infrastructure: enclosed trailer and concession space</li>
<li>$15,000 - Start-up Capital: utilities, payroll, rent, and other expenses in initial months of operation</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573497434/vugrz3hwxrycxhf8nlue.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We look forward to your partnership in this venture and can't wait to create a local entertainment destination! Each and every contribution will bring us one step closer to our dream. In addition to knowing that you’re helping us make history in our town, we’ve set up a series of awesome perks as a just one more gesture of gratitude! THANK YOU for your contributions!</p>

We will partner with local establishments to secure space and will offer food trucks with high quality and traditional fare. The pop-up will allow the Verde Drive-In to gain local support while keeping expenses low allowing us to grow and stabilize while continuing to secure funding for the next phase. 

What Sets Us Apart
Verde Drive-In has a distinct competitive edge in that it is the only movie theater within 20 miles of our target location and the only Drive-In throughout Northern Arizona. Other community organizations with outdoor movies do not pose a threat because they have a limited run, target a specific audience, and moviegoers do not sit in their vehicles which exposes them to the weather and insects. 

Competition for movie theaters comes in a number of different forms. In general you could describe the indirect competition as any entertainment alternative in the local area, however all local entertainment other than movie theaters will be seen as an ally in creating a family friendly entertainment destination here in the Verde Valley.
Verde Drive-In will differentiate itself from its competitors by creating a family friendly entertainment experience. Research of Drive-Ins across the country have shown that implementing theme nights or limited-run series, as well as photo booths, food trucks, and additional entertainment options have proven successful in creating a quality entertainment experience.
Our advantage is also the beneficial climate which results in an extended season. The weather in the Verde Valley allows for at least 9 months of operation. This will ensure that the Drive-In experience remains attractive and enjoyable to customers.
Drive-In theaters are opening across the country as 'Retro' is coming back. We will capitalize on the nostalgia the Baby Boomer generation has towards Drive-In theaters. To aid in the Classic / Retro experience, we will show classics and 2nd run films at the Verde Pop-Up.


What We Need & What You Get
The Verde Pop-Up will attract traditional movie-going customers and those that enjoy classics from the 1940’s to 1990’s. We will operate in a portable pop-up model greatly reducing start-up costs. This will create a more sustainable model because our mobile equipment will keep initial operating expenses low and allows us to test out new locations at minimal cost while building market penetration.
In order to accomplish this pop-up model, we are seeking funding for the following initial investments:

$25,000 - Equipment purchase:  inflatable screen, mobile projector, speakers, FM transmitter, and more
$10,000 - Infrastructure: enclosed trailer and concession space
$15,000 - Start-up Capital: utilities, payroll, rent, and other expenses in initial months of operation


We look forward to your partnership in this venture and can't wait to create a local entertainment destination! Each and every contribution will bring us one step closer to our dream. In addition to knowing that you’re helping us make history in our town, we’ve set up a series of awesome perks as a just one more gesture of gratitude! THANK YOU for your contributions!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Come Forage With Us</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">My name is Hazzel.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I went to college for fashion design. Back then, my dream was to learn manufacturing and share my creations with the world. But after a few eye-opening years, I learned about how wasteful the industry was, and was determined to not be a part of the problem. Forager is the culmination of what I've learned, my childhood inspirations, and beyond. It combines my love of vintage clothes, entrepreneurial spirit, and hope to be a part of the solution to a wasteful industry.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A brick-and-mortar shop in my hometown of Beaverton, Forager will sell casual vintage clothing, accessories, homewares, as well as other small goods that contribute to an eclectic and mindful lifestyle. It will also stock art and accessories from local makers. Forager will bring a mindful, eclectic shopping experience that shares a beautiful selection of clothes and gifts, and drives traffic to Portland's up-and-coming neighbor. It will be a cozy and welcoming shop with photo-worthy displays that you will be excited to share. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Forager will be opening in February or March 2020, in downtown Beaverton.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What we Need and Why</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our funding goal is $9.000. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I know we probably won't make this, but if we do that will be a dream come true. <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">This will help us pay for initial renovations and and supplies so we can get the doors open!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In the beginning, I'm planning to keep the business afloat with loans and credit cards, but some extra funding from you guys will help keep risk down, and give me some extra leverage to start off on the right foot!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I'm turning to IndieGoGo because I want to make my dream a reality. I do not qualify for a low interest loan because of my student loan debts and lack of collateral. I do not have family with the capital to lend me. I have been saving all that I have been able to, and investing straight into my business. Other business owners have advised that now is the best time to get in and open shop in Beaverton. I didn't want to miss my chance!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The nitty gritty: Our <u>total</u> financial goal is $48,000, to comfortably keep our cash in the positive for the first year. This goal would allow Forager yo have three months of operating expenses at our lowest point, and allow us comfortable room for error. Forager has also qualified for a P2P loan of $30,000. We plan to also open an SBA Line of Credit with Columbia Bank, along with a business credit card, to spread out debts to the terms with the lowest interest rates.</p>
</div><div><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3></div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Downtown Beaverton has very few shopping options; a list of small shops that you can count on one hand, and a dozen big box retailers that have not been doing amazingly over the years. Local residents and commuters passing through have been asking for more unique options.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Although not world-changing, this boutique will be a great asset for a growing neighborhood. Forager will excitedly get involved with city events, with a dream to be a staple of the downtown center. Along with bringing a beautiful shop to downtown Beaverton, funding this project means  bringing my dream of a vintage boutique to reality. Not only will this create a lifetime job for me, it will hopefully open up the door to many others as the shop expands, bringing more possibilities into Beaverton as a whole.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Although it will need a bit to take off, I am projecting that Forager will be profitable by its first Holiday season, and only growing afterwards.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Fortunately, I have experience in managing a retail shop, ordering supplies and inventory, marketing, design, and more. I am very confident in my abilities to run a shop as the sole owner, and finding talented stylists to cover the sales side of things. However, even with my experience, there are always risks.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The biggest risk to our business would be the <strong>unpredictability of initial sales</strong>, as one of the very few retail shops in downtown Beaverton. While we can't know for sure what our sales will be, to mitigate this as much as possible we will work closely with Impact Beaverton and financial experts to develop sales forecasts that make sense for the area. Once we are open, we will be adaptable and pivot our offerings quickly to fulfill what our customers are buying.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Another risk will be <strong>incomplete funding</strong>. If we lost any of our expected sources of funding, we may be able to get the doors open, but we may not be able to sustain our business expenses throughout the first year. Even if we decreases expenses, our rent expense will be non-negotiable. To mitigate this, we will shop around to make our funding options as thorough as possible, including loans, credit lines, and crowdfunding from friends &amp; family. We will aim to reach our funding goal in cash and loans, but additional credit options will provide a safety cushion.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">A smaller but very real risk is <strong>sudden injury or illness</strong>. Since Forager will be a Sole Proprietor LLC and the owner will be running most of the store operations, the business could fail if anything happens to the owner, even for a short time. To mitigate this, we will work with a business attorney to acquire recommended insurance policies early on. We will also aim to hire a team of reliable stylists as early as financially possible and train them on the backend operations of the shop, so that if anything terrible happens the shop can stay open.</p>

To thank you for your contribution we have prepared many nice perks just for you. Grazie!  About us The Cameli family has been managing the Vecchio Convento restaurant and hotel in Portico di Romagna and the Academy Olmo school of Italian language and cuisine for four generations.A family of chefs and restaurateurs who believed in the development of the social and economic fabric of the Tuscan-Romagna Apennines and still believes in the revitalization of the area today by developing food and wine tourism and small local businesses.Today the family business is run by the Massimiliano and Matteo brothers, two chefs who have always worked in the best kitchens in the world, especially in Northern Europe. Invited by internationally acclaimed chefs to play a leading role in theme nights, cooking shows, fairs, festivals, wine tastings and events, Massimiliano and Matteo never forget the origins and traditions of their homeland, Romagna-Tuscany.
 What is the ""Social Restaurant"" Project?And why is it ""social""?The ""Social Restaurant""; project arises from the personal experiences of Massimiliano and Matteo who found firsthand, while visiting the Nordic countries, that ""classic Italian"" cuisine really is one of the most appreciated in the world, but at the same time the experience and professionalism necessary to produce it are not as widespread. The question arose spontaneously for Massimiliano: ""Why not bring a little Italian style to Northern Europe?"" Our plan is to export the most authentic Tuscan-Romagna culinary tradition to Denmark and to import business and know-how to Portico di Romagna and the surrounding area with the help of those who believe in this idea."" The business challenge is to create new lasting jobs and bring new investments into our area and other areas of the Tuscan-Romagna Apennines, as they are subject to a critical decrease in the population and consequent lack of economic sustainability of many projects.We will therefore combine the artisan heart of the Romagnolo people with the typical business knowledge of Nordic countries, exploiting the passion for Italian cuisine and respect for nature and tradition as a link. Social stands, above all, for ""social sector"", as a large part of the fundings from the Project will be used to support and (re)finance social and ethical projects and cultural schemes in Portico di Romagna and the surrounding area.Massimiliano and Matteo have already successfully completed several social projects with a method they invented called ""Cooking for Joy"", which combines cooking with yoga and storytelling to ""restore the soul of the most fragile people"". For example:
the Cooking School in Prison in Forlì, both for women and men
the Cooking School in the Village of Joy of the ""Papa Giovanni XXIII"" Association of Forlì dedicated to people with social problems

Cooking Courses for non-EU people for the purposes of helping them to find employment.
But social stands also - and obviously - for ""social networks"" ... because we need your help to spread the project to all your friends and acquaintances, Italian and non-Italian, inviting them to participate in crowdfunding.   TargetsThe ""Social Restaurant"" is a complex project that consists of several steps, each with a specific objective/purpose, which we will only be able to achieve if adequate funding levels are reached.The goals are ambitious, but not unattainable. We will find part of the fundings with direct investments by private individuals, business people and local companies that believe in the rebirth of the Tuscan-Romagna Apennines ... but we also need your crowdfunding contribution! Step 1: Osteria and Pizzeria in Odder (Denmark)On reaching the first € 150,000 we will open an Osteria and Gourmet Pizzeria in Odder, Denmark, with an adjoining wine shop and retail and wholesale of typical products of Romagna. The culinary proposal will be ""classic Italian"" (from Romagna) and we will only use top quality ingredients from our area.To help Massimiliano and Matteo in this great project, an international team of first-rate professionals (managers, chefs, bakers, and so on) from all over the world was set up. Step 2: Bakery and Pastry in Portico di Romagna (Italy)On reaching € 250,000, we will open a bakery and pastry shop in Portico di Romagna with a short supply chain of grain. Under the supervision of the Mulino Pransani company, we will plant ancient organic grains in collaboration with local farmers, to produce our flour and create income and new jobs in the Apennines (we estimate at least 10 jobs). We will also dedicate a large space to pastry, where, as master pastry chefs, we will develop new recipes and new combinations starting from local products and raw materials.
Step 3: Restoration of the 17th century water mill in Portico di Romagna (Italy) On reaching € 350,000, together with co-financing by the Emilia Romagna Region, we will be able to participate in the restoration of a 17th century water mill of great historical and cultural value.This mill will enable us to produce flour in an artisanal way and particularly from ancient grains, creating new jobs and a greater fixed income for local farmers (we estimate at least 8 jobs).  ConsultantsFor the planning and implementation of this project we made use of an international team of professionals, from Italy and Denmark:

Invitati da chef di caratura internazionale a partecipare come protagonisti in serate a tema, cooking show, fiere, festival, wine tasting ed eventi, Massimiliano e Matteo non dimenticano mai le origini e le tradizioni della loro terra: la Romagna-Toscana. Cos’è il Progetto “Social Restaurant”?E perché è “social”?Il progetto “Social Restaurant” nasce dalle esperienze personali di Massimiliano e Matteo, che visitando i paesi nordici hanno constatato in prima persona che la cucina “classica italiana” è, per davvero, una delle più apprezzate del mondo, ma che allo stesso tempo l’esperienza e la professionalità per realizzarla non sono altrettanto diffuse.A Massimiliano la domanda è sorta spontanea: “Perché non portare un po’ di italianità nel Nord Europa?”.“Proviamo a esportare in Danimarca la tradizione culinaria tosco-romagnola più verace e a importare business e know-how a Portico di Romagna e dintorni, con l’aiuto di chi crede in questa idea.” La sfida imprenditoriale è quella di creare nuovi posti di lavoro duraturi e portare nuovi investimenti nella nostra area e nelle altre aree dell’Appennino Tosco-Romagnolo, in quanto soggette a una decrescita critica della popolazione e conseguente insostenibilità economica di molti progetti.Uniremo quindi il cuore artigiano dei Romagnoli alla conoscenza del business tipica dei paesi del nord, sfruttando come legante la passione per la cucina italiana e il rispetto della natura e della tradizione.Social sta, soprattutto, per “sociale”, in quanto gran parte dei ricavati del Progetto sarà utilizzata per supportare e (ri)finanziare progetti sociali ed etici, iniziative culturali nell’area di Portico di Romagna e dintorni. Massimiliano e Matteo hanno già portato a termine con successo diverse iniziative sociali con un metodo da loro inventato chiamato ""Cooking for Joy"", che unisce la cucina allo yoga e allo storytelling per ""restaurare l'animo delle persone più fragili"".

We want to keep it running - with your help.</h3><p>-----</p><p>Freedom Lanes, a 16-lane bowling center, is a staple in Mountain Home, Idaho – Elmore County’s capital city. The center serves all the surrounding towns (about 28,000 people) and offers recreational opportunities to seniors, active duty military and veterans, students of all ages and the general public.  Some of the bowling center’s current senior league members started in that very house when they were juniors.  The center hosts Special Olympics events, charity and junior tournaments, and city competitions in addition to weekly leagues, and it was scheduled to host the 2021 State Championships before COVID came in and devastated communities and businesses alike. </p><p> </p><p>The current owner has talked about selling the center in the past, but things were running smoothly and business was consistent, so he decided to hold onto it.  The business took a distressing hit to the budget, however, when COVID first limited its capacity and then forced the doors closed in late March of 2020, and the owner struggled through several months of uncertainty until he was able to reopen.  Sadly, when the doors opened, some of his customers didn’t return and his league membership dropped – along with his employee roster.  He is now only open four days per week for roughly four hours at a time.  He counts on the winter revenue to carry him through the summer months, when he has little to no business due to the excellent outdoor activities in our beautiful state.  Sixteen hours of business per week isn’t going to give him what he needs to pay the bills.  Now he’s ready to sell.  If he doesn’t sell, the center may eventually close for good.  We don't know when, but we want to keep that from happening.</p><p> </p><p>We want to continue to provide the people with somewhere to go where we can be together, listen to some music, laugh a little (or a lot), eat, bowl, catch up, and lean on each other.  The center gives the bowlers a sense of community, of belonging.  Despite the growth of Mountain Home and the increasing property values, the movie theater in town has already closed. The closest opportunity for indoor recreation and entertainment for all ages, aside from the military base which isn’t open to everyone, is nearly an hour away in each direction.  Unfortunately, with the vaccine just now being distributed and the future of COVID uncertain, banks are not anxious to lend money to businesses – especially entertainment businesses – right now.  And that’s where YOU come in.  We are trying some creative community-based financing to keep the center’s doors open.</p><p> </p><ul>

We want to keep it running - with your help.-----Freedom Lanes, a 16-lane bowling center, is a staple in Mountain Home, Idaho – Elmore County’s capital city. The center serves all the surrounding towns (about 28,000 people) and offers recreational opportunities to seniors, active duty military and veterans, students of all ages and the general public.  Some of the bowling center’s current senior league members started in that very house when they were juniors.  The center hosts Special Olympics events, charity and junior tournaments, and city competitions in addition to weekly leagues, and it was scheduled to host the 2021 State Championships before COVID came in and devastated communities and businesses alike.  The current owner has talked about selling the center in the past, but things were running smoothly and business was consistent, so he decided to hold onto it.  The business took a distressing hit to the budget, however, when COVID first limited its capacity and then forced the doors closed in late March of 2020, and the owner struggled through several months of uncertainty until he was able to reopen.  Sadly, when the doors opened, some of his customers didn’t return and his league membership dropped – along with his employee roster.  He is now only open four days per week for roughly four hours at a time.  He counts on the winter revenue to carry him through the summer months, when he has little to no business due to the excellent outdoor activities in our beautiful state.  Sixteen hours of business per week isn’t going to give him what he needs to pay the bills.  Now he’s ready to sell.  If he doesn’t sell, the center may eventually close for good.  We don't know when, but we want to keep that from happening. We want to continue to provide the people with somewhere to go where we can be together, listen to some music, laugh a little (or a lot), eat, bowl, catch up, and lean on each other.  The center gives the bowlers a sense of community, of belonging.  Despite the growth of Mountain Home and the increasing property values, the movie theater in town has already closed. The closest opportunity for indoor recreation and entertainment for all ages, aside from the military base which isn’t open to everyone, is nearly an hour away in each direction.  Unfortunately, with the vaccine just now being distributed and the future of COVID uncertain, banks are not anxious to lend money to businesses – especially entertainment businesses – right now.  And that’s where YOU come in.  We are trying some creative community-based financing to keep the center’s doors open. 

For up to a $49 donation, you will have our eternal thanks and a shout-out on our website.

Between $50 and $149, you will have our eternal thanks, a website shout-out – and a window sticker to show your support.

For a $150-$249 donation, you’ll have all of the above, and your name on a permanent “Thank You” plaque in the bowling center.

Between $250 and $499, add free open bowling for a month to everything listed above.

For $500 to $999, we’ll include an entry into our first Pro Am tournament (TBD).

For donations of $1,000 or more, we’ll have to figure something out.

<p>Aniin (Hello!) my name is Tara Everett and I'm and Anishinaabe Innovator, Motivator and Entrepreneur and proud Founder and CEO of Canoe Coworking Inc.</p>
<p>A passionate helper my path started in Business Administration, Career Development and Program Coordination. When I lost my job suddenly I missed having a community in which to do good work - a home office wasn't cutting it anymore and like many freelancers my mental health was taking a toll. When I looked for a space that reflected my cultural and traditional values and didn't find one I was gifted with the idea for Canoe Coworking Inc.</p>
<p>What started as a desire for a place to gather to do work blossomed into an International movement to empower Indigenous peoples in business to collaborate and help each other grow. The approach to Canoe we are taking is holistic and includes making spiritual, cultural and health a core focus to our success as business owners and original stewards of the land.</p>
<p>Winnipeg, Manitoba has one of the highest concentrations of Urban Indigenous people in Canada but our businesses are scattered and programs are a patchwork quilt to access. Canoe intends to provide the space, members so we can partner with experts to help our community grow to new heights. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Combining a life long love of coffee and the talent to make it well, Chloe So Hyun No and James Anderson first began planning a coffee business at our English language school in Seoul, South Korea.  It has been a shared dream of ours to own and work in our own coffee operation for years, and this campaign marks the final step towards actualizing this dream.</p>
<p>Though I have worked for years as an English teacher in South Korea, a job I loved dearly, making coffee drinks has always been among my greatest passions in life.  Equal parts science and intuition, there is a certain zen to creating drinks that is difficult for me to find in other activities.  Nothing makes me happier than handing someone their drink and watching them share an inward smile before they take a sip.</p>
<p>My partner, Chloe So Hyun No, is a fellow coffee aficionado and a consummate and unapologetic fan of the creation and consumption of snacks.  A talented baker and cook, she practices her craft every weekend, seeking out instruction from the best that Seoul has to offer to hone her skills and make connections.  She has a keen mind for business and self-improvement and is the ""feet on the ground"" to my ""head in the clouds.""</p>
<p>We are creating this business because we have faith in our abilities and believe in our vision.  We are almost there, and now we are endlessly thankful that we have people to help us across the finish line. </p>
<p>Your contribution means everything to us.  It could help provide for part of our new espresso machine or coffee pot, upfit and design on our van, or even something small but vital like cup sleeves or napkins.</p>
<p>We have made something really neat here.  We hope that you are as excited as we are to be a part of it.</p>

This area of Southeast Baltimore, though home to nearly fifty thousand residents, has been without a bookstore. In fact, there are no bookstores OR comic shops in the entire 21224 region, with the nearest comic shop a 45-minute bus ride away!</p><p>Like many folks, Dreamers &amp; Make-Believers owner Miranda Nordell turned to books during the pandemic. But, with the library closed and no bookstores within easy reach, this proved more difficult than expected. After a year of difficulty accessing new books, and discovering that even without a pandemic, things like middle-grade graphic novels were hard to come by in Baltimore, Miranda decided this just wouldn’t do! If you can’t find what you’re looking for, it might be time to build it yourself.</p><p>This wasn’t a sudden dream, however, as, prior to relocating to Baltimore, Miranda managed a set of world-renowned comic book stores on the west coast. As the general manager for two comic book stores in Northern California, Miranda became deeply enmeshed in the world of comics and graphic novels. Not only did Miranda hone her skills of recommending the perfect read, but she also developed programs for the community, partnered with local teachers and librarians, and built relationships with comic creators around the world! Since 2017, Miranda has also run the social media account “Femme Power Comix”, which promotes feminist stories in comics, literature, pop culture and beyond.</p><p>On a more personal note, Miranda’s deep love of comics comes from discovering the medium at a unique and important time. After a traumatic incident, Miranda found herself watching Netflix’s Jessica Jones, and was surprised to see similarities between the fictional character’s expressions of trauma and her own. Though Miranda had never read a comic book before, she felt drawn to her local shop in hopes of discovering more information on this flawed hero. What she found was a world of them! Comic books like Jessica Jones and She-Hulk were more than stories, they were the beginning of a fictional support group full of similarly flawed women also trying to crawl up from a dark place. MIranda never expected the medium of comics to have such a profound impact, or to serve as a catalyst for empowerment and growth, but since that time, Miranda has dreamed of helping others know comic books and graphic novels in that same way.</p><p>When a Brewers Hill doctor’s office that had been vacant for nearly a decade became available for lease, it only took one visit before Miranda knew it would be the perfect place to house her dream of a neighborhood bookstore. A place that spent decades helping Southeast Baltimore heal will continue that tradition, only now through the transformative (and healing) power of books!</p><p>Miranda’s plan is to create a warm &amp; welcoming place where the community can go for reading recommendations, and where the curious, casual newcomer and veteran comic book aficionado alike will feel confident that the shop will reflect and meet their literary needs. Unfortunately, comic book spaces are notorious for making customers feel as though a high-barrier of knowledge is required for entry; Miranda rejects the notion of “gate-keeping”, and is incredibly committed to creating a place that feels approachable and user-friendly for everyone.</p><p>Dreamers &amp; Make-Believers will offer a diverse array of books, but will specialize in graphic novels, with a particular focus on stories written and illustrated by women, members of the queer community, and BIPOC. The shelves will be stocked with books and comics for the Dreamer of every age- from board &amp; picture books to young adult and adult stories. Dreamers &amp; Make-Believers will also have thousands of periodical comic books for sale, as well as fun gifts and goodies like enamel pins, t-shirts, and even tarot cards!</p><p> </p><h2><strong><u>How You Can Help:</u></strong></h2><p>Miranda is so excited to breathe new life into this long vacant neighborhood doctor’s office! She and her husband knew as soon as they walked into this space, that it was a place where people came to be helped and to feel better, but turning exam rooms into a bookstore will require some creative renovations. Between permit fees, contractors, tool rentals, and demolition (to tear down walls, replace the floors and lighting, and install heating and cooling), they will need <strong>$20,000</strong>. They have carefully calculated these costs and added a small cushion for any associated surprises that often come with construction projects.</p><p>To fit out the store, they will need bookshelves, displays, a sales counter, and comfy seating for reading. There is a budget of <strong>$6,000</strong> for these fixtures.</p><p>With a planned 54 shelves in the store for middle grade, young adult, and adult books, they will need funding to purchase at least 2,200 titles. When adding in the children’s book displays and back stock, they will need to purchase approximately 4,000 books, plus associated fun merchandise goodies, bringing the total to <strong>$28,000</strong> for full inventory.</p><p>They will also have business-related costs, including a register and point of sale system, store signage, and a security system, with a budget of <strong>$6,000</strong>.</p><p>Recognizing that it often takes time to launch a new business, any additional funds will help them to set aside a nest egg for rent, utilities, future stock purchases, events, and marketing costs.</p><p><strong>All in all, Miranda is hoping this amazing community can help her to raise at least $60,000.</strong></p><p> </p><h2><u>Challenges &amp; Goals:</u></h2><p>Miranda realizes that the past year has been extremely challenging, particularly for small businesses.  And, yet, if there is one thing that we learned from this past year it’s how important the independent store owner is to the overall wellbeing of our community.  We also learned how important it is to be there for one another, whether on the other end of the phone, other side of a computer screen, or in the pages of a book. A good book can provide a safe place for you to both lose yourself and find yourself, and to imagine that there is more to life than you can actually <i>see</i>.

Have you ever truly wondered how Moms and Dads travel with 1 Baby, 2, 3, or even 4?  They struggle to drag luggage and Baby Gear like Car Seats, Strollers or Pack and Plays without losing their patience and their minds.  When you travel with a baby or toddler, traveling light is but a distant dream. Lugging Double Strollers, Pack and Plays, Toys, Car Seats and more will not only slow you down but weigh you down and now-a-days cost you significantly more with the exuberant airport fees for carry-ons and checked baggage.  We understand these struggles all to well, we were that family!  As a result of this, we decided to launch Coast 2 Coast Babies , the perfect solution for this problem.  Mom! Dad!  You can tuck away your troubles.

<p>Yang Market has been the cornerstone of Eckington for over 70 years. Located at the corner of Summit &amp; U Streets NE, the store opened in the 1940s as one of many District Grocery Stores (DGS) operating throughout the region. Yang Market has stood witness to the evolution of our neighborhood and city ever since.<br/> <br/>Yang Market's closing last December was a blow to the neighborhood because it was more than a convenience store, but an integral part of Eckington's history. We saw the need to restore this cornerstone as the place you can get your morning coffee and bagel, satisfy your sweet tooth, and we'll even be there when you run out of dog food.<br/> <br/>Although it has only been closed for seven months, a great deal of elbow grease was required to bring Yang Market back to life. From the removal of the bulletproof glass, installing a new floor, freshly painted walls, to a double deep cleaning - This restoration has been a family labor of love. Our combined backgrounds include graphic &amp; interior design, home &amp; business organization, hospitality, and marketing. Not only do we see owning Yang Market as a great way to put all our skills to use, but we also want to provide a space for all of Eckington to enjoy.</p>
<p>We've taken care of the heavy lifting and now reaching out to our friends and neighbors for help stocking Yang Market with your favorite things. We look forward to reopening the doors of this Eckington treasure! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ritual Island is a movement, wellness and community studio, co-created by Dr. Emily Bennett ND and movement entrepreneur, Robin Lamarr in 2017, in Hamilton Ontario. Together we’re interested in building self-awareness and community by creating accessible and inclusive experiences through decolonized wellness platforms.<br/><br/>Currently, we are a studio without walls, collaborating with various venues to host movement classes, workshops, and our one-of-a-kind teacher training. Our complementary health services (naturopathic medicine, community acupuncture, massage, counselling, +) operates under Ritual Island's former incarnation, Inland Island, founded by Emily, on King and Locke.<br/><br/>We came together, wanting to collaborate on a bigger vision of how whole body health can reach more people, bringing our joint offerings and radical dreams under one roof. Our services are/will be community considerate and socially engaged. What does this mean? It means every one is welcome, no one is priced out and we are ACTIVELY creating reform in how for-profit-businesses can serve all communities. It means our services are offered on sliding scale. It means we want to create exclusive and safer spaces for marginalized folks. It means we want to use Ritual Island as a launching pad for projects outside of what is typically found at wellness studios.<br/> <br/>We keep being challenged with the ask, ""How badly do you want to build this Ritual Island home? At what cost?"". Lucky for Hamilton, we are committed. We believe opening up this home is something we need to do because its benefits go way beyond our career ambition. It's truly for the collective. It's for community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Originally hoping to be open before December, we have faced another delay and won't be able to open until the spring. We've already begun paying rent on this 4000sqft space and have begun renovations. We are IN IT. We don't have the funds to pay rent without operating in the space. So we need to appeal to YOU. Our community. Who we're building this space for. Will you help us?</p>
<p>As a thank you for your support, there are various gifts that you can choose from that range from services at our future studio, to services and sweet goods from our small business friends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are often fundraising and donating our time to various social justice initiatives. This year (our first year in existence!) we raised $1050 for RAICES Texas (benefitting the Mexican family migrant crisis), $707.50 for Interval House (a women's shelter in Hamilton), our teacher training is THE FIRST program to offer scholarships to people of colour, and we have just launched the Root to Bloom tote for a Six Nations immersion school. We treat our work as a way to spread a message of active compassion and to empower community.</p>
<p>Our community studio will allow us to share more of our services. At least 25% of our services will be offered on sliding scale. We will have multiple pay-what-you-can movement classes offered throughout the week. The pay-what-you-can proceeds will benefit community causes like local women’s shelters and indigenous health centres. We will create exclusive programming for marginalized folks, ex: BIPOC (black, indigenous, people of colour) and Queer and Trans movement workshops. We will be able to offer more community acupuncture hours, giving our practitioners more work, but also expanding on a financially considerate health service for more people to access.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jason Dean Holness and I am the Founder of the Black Owned Businesses and Entrepreneurship (BOBE) Group. As a Social Entrepreneur, Activist and Afro-futurist; I have always been keen to use my ideas to create solutions to social problems and provide tools for the sustainable development of marginalized communities.</p>
<p>Consequently,  lack of job opportunities, high unemployment rates, social exclusion and lack of structural support are some of the issues affecting Africa and African diaspora peoples all over Scandinavia. Reports published by the Länsstyrelsen Stockholm, 2018, shows that nowadays anti-black racism and discrimination in the labor market is on the rise. There exists  a clear connection between a person's income and access to the labor market and the color of a person's skin, despite the possession of equivalent qualifications.</p>
<p>As a result of this many people from the African diaspora, including myself, have been forced to create businesses in order to offset the barriers and challenges presented to us by structural and symbolic racism. Unfortunately, though African and African diaspora peoples are starting businesses at greater rates, they are also failing at greater rates. Many new African and African diaspora businesses never get off the ground and for those that do actually start, they are not growing as quickly or as big as white-owned companies.</p>
<p><strong>African and African diaspora people are very entrepreneurial oriented, yet they are failing at very high rates, this is a clear indication that something in the process is causing that. </strong><strong>According to Black business owners and analysts this can be attributed to a lack of proper planning, poor capital structure and stigmas.</strong></p>
<p>The Black Owned Business and Entrepreneurship (BOBE) Group started with the purpose of positively impacting Swedish and by large Scandinavian society, by using business and entrepreneurship as a means to create a space for African and African diaspora peoples to succeed and to prosper in spite of the challenges they face in the labor market. We  aim to promote a positive image of African and African diaspora peoples as entrepreneurial , innovative and successful business owners.</p>
<p>The Black Owned Business and Entrepreneurship (BOBE) Summit is among the BOBE group of activities and will be hosted for the first time on May 4, 2019 in Copenhagen , and we aim for it to be the largest Summit for African and African diasporic businesses, entrepreneurs and business professionals in Scandinavia. We invite current business owners, entrepreneurs, business professionals and participants in the public discourse to our Summit to be party to keynote speeches, seminars and discussions around our event theme <strong><i>“Elevating the narrative and creating a culture among black owned businesses and entrepreneurs”. </i></strong></p>
<p>We aim to create value by providing the array of diverse entrepreneurs in attendance with networking, partnership, financing, and other business-building opportunities.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The BOBE Summit is so vital to African and African diaspora entrepreneurs and business owners on a local and national level: “Our Summit is addressing the greatest issue facing black businesses. I argue that the biggest challenge to our companies isn’t just the lack of access to capital. It’s scale and the knowledge of how to do so.</p>
<p>Currently, 95% of Afrian and African diaspora businesses are sole proprietorships, which means that most African and African Diaspora entrepreneurs are employing themselves. We are using this event to help them build capacity so that they do business with large corporations and as a result, employ large numbers of African and African diaspora peoples and impact on our communities.</p>
<p>The BOBE Summit 2019 will address issues confronting today’s business owners, including how to handle daunting competitive obstacles, leverage technology to achieve greater efficiency and profitability, and learn to pivot in an increasingly fast-paced, chaotic environment.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Jason Dean Holness and I am the Founder of the Black Owned Businesses and Entrepreneurship (BOBE) Group. As a Social Entrepreneur, Activist and Afro-futurist; I have always been keen to use my ideas to create solutions to social problems and provide tools for the sustainable development of marginalized communities.
Consequently,  lack of job opportunities, high unemployment rates, social exclusion and lack of structural support are some of the issues affecting Africa and African diaspora peoples all over Scandinavia. Reports published by the Länsstyrelsen Stockholm, 2018, shows that nowadays anti-black racism and discrimination in the labor market is on the rise. There exists  a clear connection between a person's income and access to the labor market and the color of a person's skin, despite the possession of equivalent qualifications.
As a result of this many people from the African diaspora, including myself, have been forced to create businesses in order to offset the barriers and challenges presented to us by structural and symbolic racism. Unfortunately, though African and African diaspora peoples are starting businesses at greater rates, they are also failing at greater rates. Many new African and African diaspora businesses never get off the ground and for those that do actually start, they are not growing as quickly or as big as white-owned companies.
African and African diaspora people are very entrepreneurial oriented, yet they are failing at very high rates, this is a clear indication that something in the process is causing that. According to Black business owners and analysts this can be attributed to a lack of proper planning, poor capital structure and stigmas.
The Black Owned Business and Entrepreneurship (BOBE) Group started with the purpose of positively impacting Swedish and by large Scandinavian society, by using business and entrepreneurship as a means to create a space for African and African diaspora peoples to succeed and to prosper in spite of the challenges they face in the labor market. We  aim to promote a positive image of African and African diaspora peoples as entrepreneurial , innovative and successful business owners.
The Black Owned Business and Entrepreneurship (BOBE) Summit is among the BOBE group of activities and will be hosted for the first time on May 4, 2019 in Copenhagen , and we aim for it to be the largest Summit for African and African diasporic businesses, entrepreneurs and business professionals in Scandinavia. We invite current business owners, entrepreneurs, business professionals and participants in the public discourse to our Summit to be party to keynote speeches, seminars and discussions around our event theme “Elevating the narrative and creating a culture among black owned businesses and entrepreneurs”. 
We aim to create value by providing the array of diverse entrepreneurs in attendance with networking, partnership, financing, and other business-building opportunities.

That’s what we care about the most at Accent Artisan. We believe that we talk before we write and we listen before we read. Whether you want to move to the US and pursue your American dream, or you’re a teacher, a call center crusader or just an enthusiast, you’re always talking to people. Nobody can see inside your head and that’s why being heard and understood plays such a critical role in our lives.

There are many reasons why they think it’s impossible to sound like a native, or why it’s not that important. Unfortunately, these beliefs are often shared with language teachers and even accent coaches.</p><p>It can be a challenge to show people they can do something they’re not sure they can do.

In the vast job market open to English speakers, not all of the 1 billion plus non-native speakers are considered equal.</p><p>Studies consistently show that your accent plays a massive role in how you are perceived, how you understand native speakers and how they understand you. English is a stress-based language. That means a great deal of meaning is conveyed through pauses, emphasis, intonation. It's not enough to spell things out.</p><p>We know that it is absolutely possible to learn a language to the same degree as a native speaker. To learn to speak with a native speaker's accent, you don’t have to be raised in a particular country or have been exposed to the language at home from an early age, as many people still believe. Accent Artisan aims to tear down those myths.</p><p>For this reason Accent Artisan is primarily intended for non-native English speakers.

That’s what we care about the most at Accent Artisan. We believe that we talk before we write and we listen before we read. Whether you want to move to the US and pursue your American dream, or you’re a teacher, a call center crusader or just an enthusiast, you’re always talking to people. Nobody can see inside your head and that’s why being heard and understood plays such a critical role in our lives. By contributing to this campaign you could help people to get better jobs, grow in their careers, get access to better education or make it big in Hollywood ;-).People have all kinds of limiting beliefs when it comes to language acquisition. There are many reasons why they think it’s impossible to sound like a native, or why it’s not that important. Unfortunately, these beliefs are often shared with language teachers and even accent coaches.It can be a challenge to show people they can do something they’re not sure they can do. Accent Artisan is different because Adam went through that process. We not only know it’s possible, but we also know what it takes to get there.People spend a lot of money and time on studying English. Today at least 1.5 billion people speak English of which only about 375 million are native speakers. Some manage to move to an English-speaking country and yet after 20 years of living there they still sound like they just got off the boat. In the vast job market open to English speakers, not all of the 1 billion plus non-native speakers are considered equal.Studies consistently show that your accent plays a massive role in how you are perceived, how you understand native speakers and how they understand you. English is a stress-based language. That means a great deal of meaning is conveyed through pauses, emphasis, intonation. It's not enough to spell things out.We know that it is absolutely possible to learn a language to the same degree as a native speaker. To learn to speak with a native speaker's accent, you don’t have to be raised in a particular country or have been exposed to the language at home from an early age, as many people still believe. Accent Artisan aims to tear down those myths.For this reason Accent Artisan is primarily intended for non-native English speakers. With this campaign our goal is to create the first section of a comprehensive self-guided platform for the Accent Artisan method. This section is dedicated to showing you how to master the basic pronunciation patterns of the English language.This is where your contributions come in.The bulk of the funds we need will go to the Accent Artisan iPhone app. Why an iPhone app? Because you get an awesome easy-to-use product that you can take anywhere you go.Quality is number 1 for us - in teaching and in presentation. We understand that part of great functionality is a great design. All of us are happier using something that’s pretty AND functional.We would like to work with the very well experienced team at Cleevio. These are the guys that have made apps like Snippit, Youradio, Spendee, Taasky and more.

<p>
</p><p>In the near future,
Taiwan will become one of the most ageing population country in the world.
There are many wheelchair users who never know about accessible transport, for
lack of information or couldn’t afford the fare of accessible service which
result in miserableevent. More
vitality and support will advanced us to expand our service to those in need,
to relieve their stress from being disabled. </p>
<p>We welcome you, your family and friends to join
our exceptional travel routes in Taiwan. With your perspective, we would make
progress in our service, and to make Taiwan as an accessible paradise in Asia. </p>
<p>If you would like to
support our goal of promoting accessible service, you can plan an accessible
trip to Taiwan with your friends and family or purchase one of our trips from the
U.S. and give it as a gift, for example to an elderly couple in a host family that
you stayed with when you were an international student in Asia. The purchaser of
the plan doesn’t have to necessarily be one of the travelers. Join one of our

<p><br/></p><br/><br/><br/><br/></div>","Let us imagine wheelchair users enjoy a tourist attraction in an open, barrier free environment.
It's not easy for people in wheelchairs to go through a 2 cm-high bump, a steep slope, or a wheelchair inaccessible vehicle while some with abilities take the conveniences for granted.We should be aware that a wheelchair user
generally has the limits of sight within 100
cm.Inaccessible
environment and disabled-unfriendly attitude more or less may
lead disabled people to figure the
possibilities of burdening their friends and family and so outdoor activities seem unreachable because anxiety goes
before their dreams.Duofu Care & Service
The founder of Duofu, Jeff Hsu, had no idea about accessible service in his twelve-year mass media
working life. One day, Jeff’s ninety years
old grandmother got injured, ill, couldn't
move by herself, and needed a wheelchair; those unexpectable changes in Jeff's mind kindled the
light of a better accessible setting for wheelchair users. In order to fulfill the ultimate concern to
accessible service, Jeff
was committed to the very first independent
accessible transport company in Taiwan.Duofu is now at Taipei in Taiwan, a beautiful
island lying off the coast of China in the Pacific Ocean. Since May 15, 2009, it
has been pioneering as a 24/7 accessible
transport supplier. Wheelchair users can harmonize their mobility simply with a phone call.Established
six years ago and, despite a variety of
unfavorable circumstances, Duofu keeps its gentle and steady influence in schools,
hotels, movie theaters, and other places, holding
a passionate and
respectful heart to share the necessity
of a wheelchair accessible environment. Duofu Believes…A
developed society always provides comprehensive
care.No
one is physically challenged, only environment.
Over the past six years,
we have gone a long way, allaying down and nurturing seeds of possibility.
However,
We will not be easily
satisfied. We will not rest.
Over the next six years,
we will be devoted to converting Taiwan into an accessible environment.To reach this goal, both
increased interaction and vitality will be necessary. 

Enjoy accessibility in Taiwan – Your supportive
purchase will make our dreams come true. A sustainable and accessible tour with
comfort and care for travelers is our appreciation of your help.

Why Taiwan?
Natural + BreathtakingAn
impressive mountainous island, Taiwan, reaches
an elevation of 4,000 ft. in some spots. The total
shoreline has more than 1,200 km. In 2014, National Geography Traveler recommended Taiwan one of the 20 Best Trip Destinations. Magnificent
nature and friendly approach will be the main
themes on tour. Taiwanese cuisine 
is another key feature that invites the
discerning tongues to the essence of Chinese culture, e.g., Din Tai Fung dumplings, street snacks – deep-fried
stinky tofu, bubble tea, and mango smoothie.    Access
All WaysDuofu
will be there for your flight arrival at the
airport. Pick-up service on an accessible shuttle bus will assist to check-in at hotel and go direct
to a tourist attraction. Each route has been
comprehensively surveyed and designed by our experienced travel planner, including how to get to wheelchair accessible bathroom. Portable equipment
and tools are available for desired yet less
accessible scenic spots.   Customize
TripIn contrast to a standard package tour, a
hassle-free itinerary will offer quality time for
wheelchair users and their family. You may
join the following travel plans as a gift or share with your loved ones.   
Support Our Goal OfPromoting Accessible Service

In the near future,
Taiwan will become one of the most ageing population country in the world.
There are many wheelchair users who never know about accessible transport, for
lack of information or couldn’t afford the fare of accessible service which
result in miserableevent. More
vitality and support will advanced us to expand our service to those in need,
to relieve their stress from being disabled. 
We welcome you, your family and friends to join
our exceptional travel routes in Taiwan. With your perspective, we would make
progress in our service, and to make Taiwan as an accessible paradise in Asia. 
If you would like to
support our goal of promoting accessible service, you can plan an accessible
trip to Taiwan with your friends and family or purchase one of our trips from the
U.S. and give it as a gift, for example to an elderly couple in a host family that
you stayed with when you were an international student in Asia. The purchaser of
the plan doesn’t have to necessarily be one of the travelers. Join one of our
accessible trips or help our funding to help us serve more physically
challenged.

</h3>
<p><b>Essential oils</b> are concentrates of the natural aromatic components of plants. In addition to attracting beneficial organisms, these aromatic compounds make up a substantial share of the plant's natural defense system against disease and pests. Therefore, many essential oils have anti-bacterial and/or anti-fungal properties.</p>
<p>Essential oils are widely used in aromatherapy and the natural healing world, in baths/soaks, in diffusers for aroma, as well as in the fragrance, body/skin care and flavoring industries. Are our essential oils ""therapeutic"" or ""clinical"" grade? Yes. They are 100% pure, unadulterated, all-natural essential oils. As such, they are highly concentrated and should be used with care.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Essential oils and hydrosols are fantastic natural alternatives to plug-in and other synthetic home-freshening options. For those that are new to this world, a single drop of essential oil on a light bulb will produce a beautiful room-filling aroma for hours.

<p>A secondary product of the distillation process is called <b>hydrosol</b> (or floral water).

</div></div>","Update: Last Day of the CampaignSo here it is, the last day of the campaign! We have thrown out the $25k goal (see table of funding levels below) and replaced it with a (very possible) $5,000 goal. Thank you to our awesome contributors for getting us this far!To reduce startup costs, we have adapted our strategy in these ways: 1) Build a smaller, more affordable distillation unit; heated with propane rather than electricity (going with propane saves us over $500 in build costs). 2) Pushed back greenhouse planting until May when heating will not be necessary; seeds will be started in mid to late April. 3) Initial planting will be around half of the greenhouse; costs will be saved by reducing upfront growing medium and organic fertilizer needs. 4) Early sales will be increased by adding a limited retail element to our sales mix.
The Company

Blue Ridge Aromatics is a craft essential oil distillery in the beautiful Appalachian mountains of Western North Carolina. This business has been in development since 2010 and we're ready to hit the ground running!
Our pilot grow space is a formerly vacant 6,000 square foot greenhouse on 4 acres in a fertile valley about 15 minutes north of downtown Asheville; home to over 170 businesses that practice aromatherapy and 7+ schools of natural healing. 
Our greenhouse is certified-organic with an innovative vertical hydroponic growing system. This design multiplies the grow space and represents a harvest potential of up to 2,000 lbs of plants per month. The rotating harvest is then steam-distilled in a custom-built stainless steel distillation unit using ancient techniques. 


Our initial production capacity is up to 10 liters of essential oil (the equivalent of 650 15ml bottles) per month. At this volume, Blue Ridge Aromatics will hire more employees and expand our cultivation outdoors in 2016 (outdoor planting opens up new species/product possibilities that are not well-suited for hydroponics). The TeamThe Blue Ridge Aromatics team is comprised of me (Ian Montgomery) and a few select advisors. This business is the natural outcome of my life's story. I have always tried to spend more time outside than in. Thus, I have worked with my hands in many trades over the years but my favorite (by far) has been horticulture. I have held management positions in nursery building and propagation, hydroponic greenhouse production and golf course maintenance.However, my passion for learning is unceasing so I also found myself studying Cultural Anthropology in Asheville, NC, Ecotourism development in Honduras and earning a Master's of Business Administration - Sustainable Enterprise in San Rafael, CA. Since 2010, I have extensively researched essential oil distillation; directly consulting with distillers, still builders, practitioners, essential oil analysts and seasoned industry experts. Finally, in January, 2015 I decided that it was time to leave my day job and completely devote my effort to the launch of Blue Ridge Aromatics!Our Need and Your Perks
Update: Perks are now priced lower! Since we cannot edit perks, existing contributors' shipments will match new contributors' perks.With our $25,000 goal, we will have the funds needed to:

Build a large food-grade stainless steel steam-distillation unit
Prepare the greenhouse for production
Purchase supplies, tools and laboratory instruments
Operate for 3 months
Build-out a stunning website where customers can check product batch numbers to learn growing conditions, chemical analyses and other info
Produce the oil and hydrosol for your Indiegogo perks (and more to sample and sell locally)

Our campaign perks are pre-orders for our essential oils and hydrosols. Plant species to be determined by the level of funding raised and contributors' feedback. We want local practitioners to have first dibs on our essential oils so national sales are not currently being planned, however out of town supporters of this campaign will have the exclusive option to purchase from us again!
Effects of different fundraising levels:



$8,000 - We can build our still. Greenhouse opening will be delayed until May when heating expenses are lower. First cultivated products available in August. Wild-harvested perks shipped July 2015. 1 part-time employee initially, switching to full-time when momentum builds.

$15,000 - We can build our still and begin greenhouse production in April. Wild-harvested perks shipped July 2015. 1 full-time employee in 2015.

$25,000 (goal) - All the capital we need to meet our budget. Greenhouse planted in late March. Perks sent June 2015. 1 full-time and 1 part-time employee in 2015.

$30,000 - Build a second still on a trailer, facilitating mobile essential oil distillation services for regional growers. Greenhouse planted in March. Prepare our 4-acre plot for planting in fall 2015. 2+ full-time employees in 2015. Perks and early product offerings will be more diverse. Perks ship June 2015.

$40,000 -  Build 2 stills (one mobile). Greenhouse planted in March. Immediately plant our 4-acre plot with aromatic crops for fall 2015 distillations. 3+ full-time employees for 2015. Perks and early product offerings will be more diverse. Perks ship June 2015.


We understand what it's like to be strapped for cash! So we have priced our perks as low as $15 (with a $5 donation level as well). We want to be clear that perk fulfillment will take priority over a rapid startup time frame. After all, without you, this initiative goes nowhere. As long as funding exceeds $4,000 we can build our still and can thus distill wild-harvested species in order to fulfill your perks. In this scenario, additional distillations and sales will be needed before we will have the capital to purchase supplies to plant the greenhouse. In the unlikely event that we do not meet this minimum funding level, worry not, we will build a smaller still and perks will be fulfilled over a longer period.Since the campaign's success relies on social sharing, any Facebook, Linkedin, Google+ and Twitter sharing you do makes a huge difference and we would appreciate the heck out of you for doing so! Indiegogo makes this easy with their sharing buttons at the top of the page. If you blog, writing a quick story about us would be monumentally helpful.

We encourage contributors to indicate a species preference. This will help shape our first few crops.

Some organic species we are considering for our first crops: Peppermint, Spearmint, Thyme, Geranium, Oregano, German Chamomile, Roman Chamomile.
That said, we have all kinds of great ideas! Here is a teaser:

Outdoor cultivated plants such as Lavender, Clary Sage, Rosemary and Hops.
Wild-harvested native species like Spruce, Hemlock, Fir and Cedar.
Local exotic invasives such as Rosa multiflora (wild-climbing rose).
Non-local exotic invasives like a Tea Tree variety in FL.
Discarded Christmas trees and trimmings (a major local agricultural industry).
The use of essential oils and hydrosols in beer and spirits production (we are Beer City USA after all).
Risks and Challenges

Any startup business faces risks. The following conditions are all working together to substantially reduce these planning and operations risks: 
Extensive horticultural experience. 
Advanced business and sustainability education and experience.
Exhaustive research, planning and consultation with essential oil (and natural healing) industry leaders.
An enthusiastic and supportive local market.
An amazing regional climate that resembles the southern French highlands (BIG leader in worldwide essential oil production). 

Our support network of advisors and regional economic initiatives. 


Limited product selection compared to traditional essential oil distributors may have a negative effect on sales. This is particularly relevant for our first year and pertaining to oils derived from tropical trees. In contrast, Blue Ridge Aromatics can offer some local selections that are difficult to source from traditional distributors as well as fulfill custom product requests where feasible.

Our goal is to entirely heat the greenhouse and preheat our distillation water with a combination of solar water heating panels and a centralized high-efficiency wood boiler.

</p><p>Hello, my name is Ashley McIver,</p>
<p>I am the owner of Get Wet Marine.</p>
<p>I have been running a marine maintenance and service business for 12 years.
I am the head Marine Fitter and have trained some of the best Marine
mechanics around.</p>
<p>I started my career in 1993 as an apprentice Fitter and Turner
completing 2 years before deciding to join the Australian Army as a
Fitter Armament which completed my Fitter and Turner apprenticeship
and so much more. I went on to complete Tank, APC and AusLav Armament
Maintenance Course's.  Then I went onto Marine Equipment Maintenance Course's.
Served overseas on deployment, and was working very closely with the Australian
Special Forces whilst deployed. My skill level at my job was extremely good and
still is.</p>
<p>I started Get Wet Marine straight out of the Australian Army in my back yard,
I quickly required a factory to move too. Then I had an idea for boat storage
and relocated to another larger factory, but my name got around quicker than I
had anticipated and the factory fast filled with boats to be serviced or
repaired.</p>
<p>I now have had to relocate to another location due to the lease being up and
building owners requiring to do maintenance to their factory. So it's time to
revisit my idea of having a large factory that anyone can have their dream boat
stored and cared for at one location. But this requires a lot of funding to
lease a suitable large location, and install a security camera system.
As well as expanding an area to 24 hour access for boat owners who go in
and out at all times of the day and
night.</p>
<p>The new factory will be located in the western suburbs of Melbourne, between
Maidstone and Altona Nth.</p>
<p>I am offering a few boat storage lots at a heavily discounted rate.</p>
<p>They are as follows; these are all up to a 25 foot boats. Anyone with a boat
larger than this, please add 10% to the following prices. All prices include
GST.</p>
<p>40 boat dry storage bays for 3 months @ $60 a week for $780.00 each</p>
<p>40 boat dry storage bays for 6 months @ $55 a week for $1430.00 each.</p>
<p>40 boat dry storage bays for 12 months @ $50 a week for $2600.00
each.</p>

</div>","GET WET MARINE- DRY STORAGE FOR BOATS.
Hello, my name is Ashley McIver,
I am the owner of Get Wet Marine.
I have been running a marine maintenance and service business for 12 years.
I am the head Marine Fitter and have trained some of the best Marine
mechanics around.
I started my career in 1993 as an apprentice Fitter and Turner
completing 2 years before deciding to join the Australian Army as a
Fitter Armament which completed my Fitter and Turner apprenticeship
and so much more. I went on to complete Tank, APC and AusLav Armament
Maintenance Course's.  Then I went onto Marine Equipment Maintenance Course's.
Served overseas on deployment, and was working very closely with the Australian
Special Forces whilst deployed. My skill level at my job was extremely good and
still is.
I started Get Wet Marine straight out of the Australian Army in my back yard,
I quickly required a factory to move too. Then I had an idea for boat storage
and relocated to another larger factory, but my name got around quicker than I
had anticipated and the factory fast filled with boats to be serviced or
repaired.
I now have had to relocate to another location due to the lease being up and
building owners requiring to do maintenance to their factory. So it's time to
revisit my idea of having a large factory that anyone can have their dream boat
stored and cared for at one location. But this requires a lot of funding to
lease a suitable large location, and install a security camera system.
As well as expanding an area to 24 hour access for boat owners who go in
and out at all times of the day and
night.
The new factory will be located in the western suburbs of Melbourne, between
Maidstone and Altona Nth.
I am offering a few boat storage lots at a heavily discounted rate.
They are as follows; these are all up to a 25 foot boats. Anyone with a boat
larger than this, please add 10% to the following prices. All prices include
GST.
40 boat dry storage bays for 3 months @ $60 a week for $780.00 each
40 boat dry storage bays for 6 months @ $55 a week for $1430.00 each.
40 boat dry storage bays for 12 months @ $50 a week for $2600.00
each.
20 boat dry storage bays for 24 months @ $45 a week for $4680.00 each.
These storage bays will be only accessible between our hours of
operation with options for after hours pick up and drop off at an extra cost.
10 boat dry storage bays for 60 months @ $50 a week for $13000.00 each.
Only these 10 areas will be given automatic free upgrade to 24 hour access
bays when they become available in approx. 12 month’s time.
All money raised will be used to create a safe and secure area for your
pride and joy.
So you will be able to have the boat you want, not the boat that can only
fit in your drive way or out the front yard for anyone to take or damage.
By taking this opportunity you will be saving anywhere from 25% - 50% in
storage fees. Money you can put into improving your boat or getting the boat
you really want.
If you don't have a boat, I'm sure you have a friend who does. So let them
know. If you see a large boat outside someone's house that clearly needs a
storage bay. Let them know about this great offer. You never known they may
just take you out for a fishing trip just to say thank you for passing on the
info that they may have never known about.
If you are interested in making any kind of donation to help me make my
dream business a possibility, Please don't hesitate to donate anything you can
please.

Dad - Buy A Mom is a community-based action group working towards eliminating
the practice of imprisoning parents over Child Support issues.    </p>
<p>Shackled
criminals streaming into courtrooms throughout the United States is a common
sight. Witnessing parents shackled at the waist for falling behind on
Child Support is compelling.  Our funds will lead us directly into the
courtrooms of Family Courts to buy back the freedom of moms and dads serving
time for Child Support issues.</p>
<p>Your
participation will not only buy back the freedom of our citizens; your
participation will also raise awareness through legislative halls and assist in
providing genuine information and support.   Our objective is to free
indebted parents and to provide solutions to tens of thousands of parents
BEFORE they are sent to our debtor prisons.</p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy A Dad - Buy A Mom needs your financial/technical/research
     support to ensure we are successful in each phase of our campaign.</li>
<li>Reaching our goal will maximize the number of
     incarcerated parents released.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Understanding the Cycle and Impact</b></p>
<p>Here's a very basic illustration of
 the systemic problem in the Child Support cycle:</p>
<p>Problems
at Home (Financial Stress) --&gt; Divorce --&gt; Employment

Child Support Payments Accrue --&gt; Released From Jail --&gt; Increased Child
Support Debt --&gt; Prison Record --&gt; More Difficult to Find Work
 --&gt; Missed Child Support Payment --&gt; Repeat Cycle.  </p>
<p>This
system neither helps keep parents current on Child Support nor gets children
the Child Support they need.  Further, this cycle is damaging to all
parties involved (parents and children), and actually costs taxpayers more
money throughout the process of prosecuting and then incarcerating parents for
up to 180 days.</p>
<p>Some of the greatest impacts of our
campaign may never be directly experienced by us:  an awkward meeting of
the parent with child, silent contemplation of a renewed chance in life, facing
the fear of failure, discovering hope and a new direction.</p>
<p>Here's what you will experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our attorneys review upcoming cases and prioritize to insure non-violent, high impact cases are attended.</li>
<li>Immediate release of parents in Child Support cases.</li>
<li>Immediate funds directed to Child Support. </li>
<li>Legislative action brought to the forefront.</li>
<li>Building of a solution-oriented website for parents.</li>
<li>Development of a community-based outreach model that
     can be duplicated in communities across the country.</li>
<li>Ongoing case and point evaluations of our efforts.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We will not have enough funds to
free everyone.  We cannot be assured that each parent will be responsive,
or even appreciate our efforts.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Prices of each case will vary, but we are initiating
     our range at: $200-$1,000.  These

<li>The more funds we raise, the greater number of releases
     we can achieve and the more lives in which we can make a positive impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are seeking change--not

improve each of our communities' condition.

I have been in this field off and on for over 15yrs. I have raised three girls mostly on my own since the age of 17,  they are ages 32, 27 and 17.  During the  last 6yrs, providing daycare it has become a full time job as my marriage of 15yrs was dissolved I became a single parent needing a full time income. Life happens ;)  During that time, I developed a business idea and the business Idea I had planned while I first separated it but it stayed with throughout this period of time. Looking back on the grand scheme of things everything happens for a reason. One thing that has remained constant throughout this time is my desire to pursue this business idea, since I was a teenager myself and have had many people tell me what a great idea it is. I am very passionate about this model for business which stems from my belief that  I whole heartedly believe that these teens are our future and that they deserve a great place to have fun and discover themselves and their talents in a supervised social environment.

As a non-alcoholic club, Parents wouldn't  have to worry about stranded teens, as Club Rayne shuttle would provide a safe alternative free of charge with a ride home. A full time sub contracted security team will consist of personnel that have prior teen venue experience. A small group of off duty police officers are already in place, volunteering some off  duty time to make this a safe venue so parents can have peace of mind while teens are in the club. This will give bored teenagers a safe place to interact and build real relationships through a face to face environment and just through a not through a social media or gaming platform.

<h2>Why we are running our campaign</h2>
<p>More
and more people around the world are joining terrorist groups such as Islamic
State, killing innocent people, promoting hatred and adding to the misery of
the Syrian people.</p>
<p>They
have been drawn to do this a result of being radicalised. Islamist extremist
organisations promote a hateful worldview which seeks to destroy freedom,
democracy, human rights, and the belief that communities should coexist
peacefully. In their destructive path to boost recruitment, they radicalise
vulnerable people all around the world by perverting the religion of Islam for
their own gain. When they target individuals, they exploit identity crisis,
heartfelt grievances and other societal problems, offering “solutions” which
only serve to exacerbate all of these.</p><span>Together as a society, with people from all
backgrounds, religious denominations and political leanings, we can fight back
against this hatred. Three things are important to this:<br/><br/></span>
<p><span><b>1)</b><span><b> </b> </span></span>Building resilience to prevent
vulnerable people from falling prey to extremism. We can do this by addressing
all the things that extremists exploit and demonstrating what makes living and
engaging in a pluralist and democratic society so great.</p>
<p><span><b>2)</b><span><b> </b> </span></span>Raising awareness of
radicalisation and the actions of extremist groups that want to curb your
freedoms. We can do this by analysing extremist organisations, cutting through
their propaganda to see the truth, and understanding how they came about.</p>
<p><span><b>3)</b><span>  </span></span>Promoting the best ways to
tackle extremism in an effective, responsible and proportionate way, free of
racism and anti-Muslim hatred, sensationalism and apologia. We can do this by
learning from previous successful and unsuccessful efforts to tackle extremism,
here in the UK and all around the world.</p>
<h2>The campaign</h2>
<p>We need
your help to raise £25,000 to help us address extremism through the medium of
film, for two main reasons. Firstly, it is clear that extremist organisations
are increasingly adept at using technology and producing professional video
content to achieve their aims of radicalisation and recruitment. Secondly, one of our main beliefs is that effectively countering extremism requires
a civil society approach - financial support from global citizens united in the
fight against extremism is a great way that our supporters can take ownership
of this with positive action.</p>
<p>Your
generous donations and support will help fight back against extremism by
funding the production of three counter-narrative videos, targeted at the three
areas listed above: <b>building resilience,
raising awareness, and promoting best practice. </b>In addition, we will also
be able to produce an educational animated video explaining <b>Quilliam’s approach to counter-extremism</b></p>
<p>The
creation of counter-narrative videos will help towards our day-to-day work to
do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Challenging Islamist ideology</i></b>: The videos will help create effective counter-narratives which
     challenge the foundations of the hateful ideology which seeks to corrupt
     individuals to cause harm. Tackling the cause of extremism as a society,
     the ideology which underpins terrorist actions, will help ensure a safer
     environment for us all in the long-term.</li>
<li>
<b><i>Increasing education and awareness</i></b>: Through encouraging civil society to actively engage in the
     creation and promotion of counter-extremism videos we can help increase
     awareness of the difference between Islamist ideology and Islam as
     spiritual faith practised by over a billion Muslims around the world
     today.</li>
<li>
<b><i>Tackling the rise of anti-politics sentiment</i></b>:  By coming together and actively challenging these views by
     donating, sharing videos through Twitter, Facebook, YouTube as well as
     other social media platforms, we can work together to promote democratic
     ways of achieving real change and persuade others that joining extremist
     groups won’t help.</li>
<li>
<b><i>Addressing grievances</i></b>: Many people justifiably oppose political decisions, find
     injustice reprehensible, or have experienced prejudice first hand. We
     stand in solidarity with those people and want to help everyone find
     peaceful, democratic and productive ways of addressing these issues,
     without resorting to myopic extremist narratives that paint all such
     grievances as evidence of a targeted conspiracy against Muslims.</li>
<li>
<b><i>Engaging communities</i></b>: To effectively counter extremism, we need a civil society
     approach. Vital to the success of this approach is the co-operation of
     Muslim communities, who are often the first victims of terrorism, have had
     their religion manipulated by the few violent extremists among them, and
     live with the negative consequences of their actions. We want to promote
     the active involvement of Muslims in this generational struggle.</li>
<li>
<b><i>Promoting pluralism</i></b>: Extremists love to target vulnerable people who aren’t sure of
     their place in society or of their identity. While it is completely normal
     to experience an identity crisis and to be unsure of the compatibility
     between nationality, religion, ethnicity and sexuality, extremists claim
     that you can overcome this feeling by following Islamism. Instead,
     pluralism is the only way that people can feel truly comfortable.</li>
<li>
<b><i>Countering extremism</i></b><i> <b>of all kinds</b>:</i> Extremism breeds extremism,
     and it is unacceptable to approach Islamism through a far-right lens,
     blaming all Muslims for the actions of several extremists, or by stooping
     to the low level of ignorant bigotry. It is important that we show
     consistent, responsible, proportionate ways of challenging all extremisms
     in our society that can make real change for the better.</li>
</ul><ul>

involved</h2>
<p>We
don’t want to be the only ones making counter-narrative videos. If you are
between the ages of 16-24, you can enter our #OpenYourEyes video competition.
Create a short video addressing one of the following issues:</p>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Why religion mustn’t be abused to promote violence</b>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Talk someone out of expressing themselves through violence against
themselves or others</b></li></ul>
<ul><li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Why a multi-faith environment is positive</b>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><b>Can the internet take over your life?</b></li></ul>

<p>Quilliam
is the world’s first counter-extremism think tank set up to address the
challenges of citizenship, identity, and belonging in a globalised world.
Quilliam stands for religious freedom, equality, human rights and democracy. We
engage in innovative research, training and public messaging to do the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge extremist ideology to expose the
     intellectual bankruptcy of the extremist worldview</li>
<li>Promote pluralism as an antidote to Islamism</li>
<li>Inspire positive change so that Muslims and
     others live harmoniously as citizens, not as separatist communities</li>
</ul>
<p>Quilliam has consistently been at the forefront of
countering extremism in the UK, since we were established in 2008. Some of our
senior members of staff were formerly Islamist extremists themselves and this
personal insight into extremist organisations shapes our analysis of how to
counter the phenomenon of radicalisation. The experience of being involved in
counter-extremism and shaping policy on the issue in the last 7 years, coupled
with the academic expertise of some staff members means Quilliam continues to
be intrinsic to the debate. Our work and approach remain vitally important,
especially as the threat from extremism and terrorism to the UK and Europe is
now greater than at any point since 9/11.</p>
<p></p></div>","Why we are running our campaign
More
and more people around the world are joining terrorist groups such as Islamic
State, killing innocent people, promoting hatred and adding to the misery of
the Syrian people.
They
have been drawn to do this a result of being radicalised. Islamist extremist
organisations promote a hateful worldview which seeks to destroy freedom,
democracy, human rights, and the belief that communities should coexist
peacefully. In their destructive path to boost recruitment, they radicalise
vulnerable people all around the world by perverting the religion of Islam for
their own gain. When they target individuals, they exploit identity crisis,
heartfelt grievances and other societal problems, offering “solutions” which
only serve to exacerbate all of these.Together as a society, with people from all
backgrounds, religious denominations and political leanings, we can fight back
against this hatred. Three things are important to this:
1)  Building resilience to prevent
vulnerable people from falling prey to extremism. We can do this by addressing
all the things that extremists exploit and demonstrating what makes living and
engaging in a pluralist and democratic society so great.
2)  Raising awareness of
radicalisation and the actions of extremist groups that want to curb your
freedoms. We can do this by analysing extremist organisations, cutting through
their propaganda to see the truth, and understanding how they came about.
3)  Promoting the best ways to
tackle extremism in an effective, responsible and proportionate way, free of
racism and anti-Muslim hatred, sensationalism and apologia. We can do this by
learning from previous successful and unsuccessful efforts to tackle extremism,
here in the UK and all around the world.
The campaign
We need
your help to raise £25,000 to help us address extremism through the medium of
film, for two main reasons. Firstly, it is clear that extremist organisations
are increasingly adept at using technology and producing professional video
content to achieve their aims of radicalisation and recruitment. Secondly, one of our main beliefs is that effectively countering extremism requires
a civil society approach - financial support from global citizens united in the
fight against extremism is a great way that our supporters can take ownership
of this with positive action.
Your
generous donations and support will help fight back against extremism by
funding the production of three counter-narrative videos, targeted at the three
areas listed above: building resilience,
raising awareness, and promoting best practice. In addition, we will also
be able to produce an educational animated video explaining Quilliam’s approach to counter-extremism
The
creation of counter-narrative videos will help towards our day-to-day work to
do the following:


Challenging Islamist ideology: The videos will help create effective counter-narratives which
     challenge the foundations of the hateful ideology which seeks to corrupt
     individuals to cause harm. Tackling the cause of extremism as a society,
     the ideology which underpins terrorist actions, will help ensure a safer
     environment for us all in the long-term.

Increasing education and awareness: Through encouraging civil society to actively engage in the
     creation and promotion of counter-extremism videos we can help increase
     awareness of the difference between Islamist ideology and Islam as
     spiritual faith practised by over a billion Muslims around the world
     today.

Tackling the rise of anti-politics sentiment:  By coming together and actively challenging these views by
     donating, sharing videos through Twitter, Facebook, YouTube as well as
     other social media platforms, we can work together to promote democratic
     ways of achieving real change and persuade others that joining extremist
     groups won’t help.

Addressing grievances: Many people justifiably oppose political decisions, find
     injustice reprehensible, or have experienced prejudice first hand. We
     stand in solidarity with those people and want to help everyone find
     peaceful, democratic and productive ways of addressing these issues,
     without resorting to myopic extremist narratives that paint all such
     grievances as evidence of a targeted conspiracy against Muslims.

Engaging communities: To effectively counter extremism, we need a civil society
     approach. Vital to the success of this approach is the co-operation of
     Muslim communities, who are often the first victims of terrorism, have had
     their religion manipulated by the few violent extremists among them, and
     live with the negative consequences of their actions. We want to promote
     the active involvement of Muslims in this generational struggle.

Promoting pluralism: Extremists love to target vulnerable people who aren’t sure of
     their place in society or of their identity. While it is completely normal
     to experience an identity crisis and to be unsure of the compatibility
     between nationality, religion, ethnicity and sexuality, extremists claim
     that you can overcome this feeling by following Islamism. Instead,
     pluralism is the only way that people can feel truly comfortable.

Countering extremism of all kinds: Extremism breeds extremism,
     and it is unacceptable to approach Islamism through a far-right lens,
     blaming all Muslims for the actions of several extremists, or by stooping
     to the low level of ignorant bigotry. It is important that we show
     consistent, responsible, proportionate ways of challenging all extremisms
     in our society that can make real change for the better.

BS Grillin’ Company is
a woman-owned enterprise based in Virginia, U.S.A. 

Celebrity Chef AJ, owner, and BBQ Pit-master Steve, husband to owner Rosa, took their
love for great BBQ sauce and smoked meats to new heights when creating the BS
Grillin’ Company - developing deep, rich BBQ sauce flavors with the subtlety of
a sophisticated aged whiskey. BS Grillin’ Company’s sauces and relishes are made with fresh
ingredients and taste delicious with chips, veggies, meats, sea food, and vegetarian/vegan options.


Why are we BETTER?
First, we are BETTER because we offer versatile healthy condiments for today's
health-conscious consumers. No other BBQ sauce or relish has as many uses as our products. Our products are interchangeable and will satisfy your taste buds, heat or sweet cravings. 
- Our relishes replace pickle relish in any recipe such egg and tuna salad, deviled eggs, potato salad, pinto beans, homemade tartar sauce, over a soften block of cream cheese, and more!



- We use the freshest fruits and veggies  along with real Bourbon and Brandy in our BBQ sauces.
 - Our BBQ Sauces replace salsa, ketchup, cocktail sauce, steak sauce, marinade, crock-pot sauce, and BBQ sauce just to name a few. Look how much money we just saved you - wow!
Our
healthy condiments have
a homemade look with a gourmet taste, just like from grandma's kitchen from the upper East side. We are currently manufacturing Kickin’ Pineapple with Honey Bourbon and Smokin’ Chipotle with Apricot Brandy BBQ Sauce.





So Why Do We Need Your HELP???Good question!  Our customers are now requesting our relishes in stores and online after falling in love with our BBQ sauces. 
We have Sweet Zucchini, Green Apple, Sweet Bell, Medium and Blazing Peppers, Autumn, and Green Tomato ready
for manufacturing. 
Secondly, we have received multiple requests for our BBQ sauces and relishes, packaged in 1.5 oz jars, in a  variety gift pack for specialty shops.
Clean great tasting condiments......“And that’s no BS!”

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b></b></h2><p></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Meet Hypeist</b></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Welcome to Hypeist’s Indiegogo page! We set this up to move forward in achieving our dream of making advertising suck less.</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b></b></p><p></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Over the past four years while studying Advertising at Syracuse University, we’ve seen technology completely reshape the way brands and consumers interact. Brands are struggling to engage with consumers who have been growing intolerant of disruptive ads in their digital lives. We see an opportunity to make brand experiences more engaging, more user-centric, and more immersive. We've realized that consumers are actually excited to engage with brands when they're being rewarded for their fandom.</p><p></p><p><b>What we do:</b></p><p><b>
</b></p><p>This inspired us to create Hypeist, a platform for users to earn exclusive products, experiences, and content from their favorite brands. Our first avenue to achieving this vision is through beacon-powered scavenger hunts in New York City where users can hunt for hidden products like backstage passes or limited edition sneakers.</p>
<p>Last semester, we ran hunts on-campus at Syracuse University for Red Bull, Amazon, Chipotle, and some other brands through social media. We were also awarded with 1st place in the Raymond von Dran technology startup competition. Right now, we're part of a Student Accelerator, where we are currently building our mobile product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After our demo day on June 26th, we’re planning to move to New York City where we will continue development and launch our product.</p><p></p>

<p></p></div>","Meet HypeistWelcome to Hypeist’s Indiegogo page! We set this up to move forward in achieving our dream of making advertising suck less.


Over the past four years while studying Advertising at Syracuse University, we’ve seen technology completely reshape the way brands and consumers interact. Brands are struggling to engage with consumers who have been growing intolerant of disruptive ads in their digital lives. We see an opportunity to make brand experiences more engaging, more user-centric, and more immersive. We've realized that consumers are actually excited to engage with brands when they're being rewarded for their fandom.What we do:
This inspired us to create Hypeist, a platform for users to earn exclusive products, experiences, and content from their favorite brands. Our first avenue to achieving this vision is through beacon-powered scavenger hunts in New York City where users can hunt for hidden products like backstage passes or limited edition sneakers.
Last semester, we ran hunts on-campus at Syracuse University for Red Bull, Amazon, Chipotle, and some other brands through social media. We were also awarded with 1st place in the Raymond von Dran technology startup competition. Right now, we're part of a Student Accelerator, where we are currently building our mobile product.

After our demo day on June 26th, we’re planning to move to New York City where we will continue development and launch our product.
But to get there, we need a little help...
Your generous contributions will enable us to begin operations in New York City and get us through our beta testing phase. This will help us power forward to the next stage, where we will be ready to seek investment.
   Any and every donation helps, and we appreciate your generosity!  The Perks:Thank you!The Hypeist Team                    Check us out online @ Hypeist.com and on Twitter @Hypeist.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are a Not for Profit organisation of fifty local crafts people who support and promote crafts handmade in Limerick. We walked into an empty building last July and together we transformed
it into the bright, busy space that you see today. Our exclusive high
calibre craft outlet has a gallery space at the rear. We also have three fully
operational craft studios which are open to the public. Kate Ramsey
operates out of the felt making studio with her two hard working assistants
Tess and Gareth. Fergus is our resident silver smith in the jewellery studio, and
Aoife Slattery, Mary Conroy and Clare Jordan make gorgeous ceramics in the
ceramics studio. They also fire their pieces here in our small kiln. We want to invite more people to use the kiln with us! We are expanding, growing and once again need your help to do this. We are a Legacy Project from Limerick City of Culture 2014. We want to continue the excitement and new burst of life that Limerick City of Culture brought to the people of Limerick. We provided a space for the public to knit a giant scarf for Granny when she visited Limerick. Our thriving Community Craft Corner grew out of that giant event. Come and knit with us every Monday and Friday morning for charities and for fun! We also run craft workshops for everyone on a regular basis. Fingers crossed with your help we can continue to grow and thrive and provide a much needed resource for crafts, crafts people and the local community. <p>

<li>Cold Storage- for short &amp; long term food holding</li>
<li>Commercial Kitchen- for farms creating value added product such as chili, tea, honey, syrup, jams, jellies...</li>
<li>Rooms- for agricultural classes &amp; farmer meetings</li>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>With an estimated 680 family-run farms in Alaska we grow a generous amount of food, but <b>95% of Alaskan food is being imported</b>.  As the state struggles with a $3.5 billion deficit, the Alaska Division of Agriculture and its supporting programs are facing massive budget cuts, including cuts to our state seed potato programs, farm to school program, agricultural inspections and a number of other agricultural supporting programs.</p>
<p>Not only does all of this damage our local family farms, all of that food being imported is bad news for FOOD SECURITY.  </p>
<p>Globalization and modern transportation- rather than making it more secure has left Alaska extremely vulnerable.  And what about all those buzz words these days like <b>organic</b>, <b>sustainability</b>, <b>community supported agriculture</b>, the <b>value of fresh picked</b> and the elusive goal of <b>food security</b>? </p>
<p>Alaska agriculture may be small in comparison to other states because the farms and ranches of Alaska are all mom and pop operations…no corporate farms here.  </p>
<p>Turning the tide from <b>importing </b>to <b>local grown</b> the <i>Alaskan peony industry</i> has paved the way to start this agricultural movement. One of the fastest growing industries in Alaska, Alaskan peonies have been shipped to every state in the U.S.A. and they are now starting to travel WORLDWIDE. For the first time <b>Alaska is exporting something besides oil and fish</b>.  Now that we have shown how overwhelmingly successful our Alaskan agricultural can be it is time to apply this success to other facets of Alaskan agriculture! </p>
<p><b>But we realize that awareness doesn’t grow food— that takes doing.  </b></p>

 Our Alaskan agriculture community needs a multi-use agricultural processing  facility for small family farms, that can provide services such as:  
Cold Storage- for short & long term food holding
Commercial Kitchen- for farms creating value added product such as chili, tea, honey, syrup, jams, jellies...
Rooms- for agricultural classes & farmer meetings
Agricultural Processing Space- that a single family farm cannot afford
Retail Space- for farms products & creations to be sold in a central location

        Help create a healthy and sustainable Alaskan agriculture through community support!



With an estimated 680 family-run farms in Alaska we grow a generous amount of food, but 95% of Alaskan food is being imported.  As the state struggles with a $3.5 billion deficit, the Alaska Division of Agriculture and its supporting programs are facing massive budget cuts, including cuts to our state seed potato programs, farm to school program, agricultural inspections and a number of other agricultural supporting programs.
Not only does all of this damage our local family farms, all of that food being imported is bad news for FOOD SECURITY.  
Globalization and modern transportation- rather than making it more secure has left Alaska extremely vulnerable.  And what about all those buzz words these days like organic, sustainability, community supported agriculture, the value of fresh picked and the elusive goal of food security? 
Alaska agriculture may be small in comparison to other states because the farms and ranches of Alaska are all mom and pop operations…no corporate farms here.  
Turning the tide from importing to local grown the Alaskan peony industry has paved the way to start this agricultural movement. One of the fastest growing industries in Alaska, Alaskan peonies have been shipped to every state in the U.S.A. and they are now starting to travel WORLDWIDE. For the first time Alaska is exporting something besides oil and fish.  Now that we have shown how overwhelmingly successful our Alaskan agricultural can be it is time to apply this success to other facets of Alaskan agriculture! 
But we realize that awareness doesn’t grow food— that takes doing.  
Here’s where you come in…

   Challenges & Benefits   
Our area’s need for a multi-agricultural processing center is not a new concept or development.  Our local and state government has
acknowledged the need and shortfall, and over many years has made multiple attempts to examine the
issue and create a facility.  However, bureaucracy
and budgets have prevented anything from ever being built. Small farms can't wait any longer, its time to move away from the bureaucracy and build it ourselves!
Food security and locally fresh food are imperative issues in today’s environment.  Cost inefficiencies of importing food are well know, along with the health and economic growth shown in supporting locally grown food.  As our local agriculture grows so does the health and well-being of our community.  Not only does developing local agriculture create jobs, it increase income in many other local supporting companies such as insurance, refrigeration, local trucking, supply stores, grocery stores, etc. 
If we could get just 10% more of our food from local grown sources then we would have $250 million going back to Alaska.  
Please help us build this facility.  You will be helping potentially hundreds of local farmers, improve their operations and livelihoods, start a movement to diversify our state economy, and support a movement towards a healthier and more secure food source for many Alaskans.
Alaska farmers need your help!     Other Ways You Can Help Please spread awareness of our project!  Share our posts on your social media and ask your friends and family to repost.  The more support we get the greater an agricultural facility we can create!

			eco-procurement for charities &amp; pay-raises for everyone!</h2><p><br/></p><p>The International Joint Strategic Procurement
Group is a platform which organizes the cost-effective
purchase of goods &amp; services for charities and NGOs. <b>By
pooling the market- power of more than 50 Austrian organizations, we
achieve savings between 30 and 70 percent on things like green
electricity, fair-trade coffee, re-use computers, printer-paper and much more. </b>Now
we want to scale-up and thus become a social enterprise, needing financial
assistance in various areas: funding- &amp; legal fees, public relations, travel costs and last but not least: the
internationalization of our model. Help us spread the word!</p>
<p><br/></p><p></p><h3>From an idea to a lighthouse project in
			two years
		</h3>
<p>Printing paper, electricity, gas, cellphones,
insurances, computers, coffee... Just like any company, non-profit
organizations have to cover day-to-day expenses. This may sound
casual – <b>but in fact, charities and NGOs spend around 20 percent
of their budget on these overhead costs. In Austria they sum up to at
least 50-100 million Euros a year!</b> That's a lot of money that does
not go to the cause that it was originally donated for – and is now saved if the organizations purchase in a joint action.</p>
<p>That's exactly what we are doing, the
<b>International Joint Strategic Procurement Group for non-profit
organizations</b>. We gather NGOs and charities, negotiate with
retailers of goods and services and <b>reach conditions which are
usually only granted to big corporations</b>. At the same time <b><i>we
only choose products that are green and ethically responsible</i></b> – not
least because non-profit organizations want to be inspiring examples
for society.</p>
<p><b>Is that working? You can bet! Here are only a
few of the savings we already achieved:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Eco-friendly printer paper: -64%</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Fair-trade coffee: -65%</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Cellphone charges: -40%</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Green electricity: -30%</b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Re-use computers: up to 70%</b></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>We guarantee that these prices go directly to
our member organizations – without any hidden payments or
commission to the IJSPG. </b>Joining
us is basically free, but we are happy to accept voluntary
contributions from the non-profit organizations who can afford it.
<b>And because this model is convincing, more than 50 organizations
have already joined us in Austria</b>. Among them are well-known
international charities and NGOs like the WWF, Greenpeace, Amnesty
International, Ashoka, SOS Children's Villages or the Red Noses
Clowndoctors.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Premium Memberships: up to four-figure
			eco-pay-raises for our member organizations
		</h3>
<p>Now we enter a critical stage: After running the
IJSPG as a voluntary project for two years, it should become a viable
social entrepreneurship. <b>Covering funding fees, hiring our first
employees, upgrading our website, globalizing our efforts, developing
a how-to manual, setting up a decent conference – all this needs to
be paid during a time when we actually want to lift off!</b> Right
now we have means of our first membership fees and what is left of a
12,000-Euro loan. Each additional Euro would enable us to grow

			eco-procurement for charities & pay-raises for everyone!The International Joint Strategic Procurement
Group is a platform which organizes the cost-effective
purchase of goods & services for charities and NGOs. By
pooling the market- power of more than 50 Austrian organizations, we
achieve savings between 30 and 70 percent on things like green
electricity, fair-trade coffee, re-use computers, printer-paper and much more. Now
we want to scale-up and thus become a social enterprise, needing financial
assistance in various areas: funding- & legal fees, public relations, travel costs and last but not least: the
internationalization of our model. Help us spread the word!
From an idea to a lighthouse project in
			two years
		
Printing paper, electricity, gas, cellphones,
insurances, computers, coffee... Just like any company, non-profit
organizations have to cover day-to-day expenses. This may sound
casual – but in fact, charities and NGOs spend around 20 percent
of their budget on these overhead costs. In Austria they sum up to at
least 50-100 million Euros a year! That's a lot of money that does
not go to the cause that it was originally donated for – and is now saved if the organizations purchase in a joint action.
That's exactly what we are doing, the
International Joint Strategic Procurement Group for non-profit
organizations. We gather NGOs and charities, negotiate with
retailers of goods and services and reach conditions which are
usually only granted to big corporations. At the same time we
only choose products that are green and ethically responsible – not
least because non-profit organizations want to be inspiring examples
for society.
Is that working? You can bet! Here are only a
few of the savings we already achieved:


Eco-friendly printer paper: -64%


Fair-trade coffee: -65%


Cellphone charges: -40%


Green electricity: -30%


Re-use computers: up to 70%



We guarantee that these prices go directly to
our member organizations – without any hidden payments or
commission to the IJSPG. Joining
us is basically free, but we are happy to accept voluntary
contributions from the non-profit organizations who can afford it.
And because this model is convincing, more than 50 organizations
have already joined us in Austria. Among them are well-known
international charities and NGOs like the WWF, Greenpeace, Amnesty
International, Ashoka, SOS Children's Villages or the Red Noses
Clowndoctors.Premium Memberships: up to four-figure
			eco-pay-raises for our member organizations
		
Now we enter a critical stage: After running the
IJSPG as a voluntary project for two years, it should become a viable
social entrepreneurship. Covering funding fees, hiring our first
employees, upgrading our website, globalizing our efforts, developing
a how-to manual, setting up a decent conference – all this needs to
be paid during a time when we actually want to lift off! Right
now we have means of our first membership fees and what is left of a
12,000-Euro loan. Each additional Euro would enable us to grow
organically and to grand more green savings to non-profit
organizations – world wide!
And not only them: in a next step we would like
to relieve the employees of our member organizations by offering them
our special tariffs for private consumption. In a job sector
which is prone to severe underpayment this means a three- to
four-figure pay-raise per year and capita – by accessing cheap
green electricity, car-sharing, organic food, yoga courses, free giro
accounts and much more!
Also companies
which are true to their corporate social responsibility will be
invited to buy a premium membership for their employees. We will ask
them to pay an increased annual fee, so we can allow non-profit
organizations a decreased one. The large ones pay more, the small
ones less – the IJSPG is reversing the conditions of the market, so

the more members will join the IJSPG, the bigger its

the Red Noses Clowndoctors, an organic pepper seed package from Arche

</div><p>Hello, my name is Melvin and I am here to tell you about Northern Virginia Cryotherapy (a sister veteran owned company of Spirit Massage and Bodywork LLC) offering innovative holistic solutions for the Northern Virginia and Washington metropolitan area.  You may have heard of Cryotherapy in the news. It looks likes a futuristic vessels which reaches a cool -264 degrees.  Freezing temperatures send the body into a ""survival mode,"" which causes blood supply to flow to the most vital organs to relay more oxygen and nutrients. Once you leave the cold environment, the enriched and less-toxic blood is flushed back into the rest of the body.</p>
<p>Northern Virginia Cryotherapy offers whole body cryotherapy and in order to open we are launching this campaign called “Cryotherapy: Live Longer and Heal Pain?!” We developed this second location in order to provide our clients with Sports compression treatments, and a wide variety therapeutic and treatment plans to improve your overall health and wellness an upgraded.  We think it will help people in need of a solution for your body’s aches and pains, environmental effects on the body and even sleep and stress issues.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about ways you could get better sleep?</p>
<p>Do you want to feel invigorated and full of energy but don’t know how?</p>
<p>Are you interested in finding relief from muscle and joint pain but don’t know where to turn?</p>
<p>If you answered, “Yes” to any of these questions, you may want to keep reading…</p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>Dressed in nothing but socks, clogs and mittens, the user will step into the capsule-like machine. Liquid nitrogen is used to cool down the sauna, and, after two to three minutes, skin temperature drops to 32 degrees and one can exit the polar chamber.</p>
<p>Whole-body and localized cryotherapy treatment has become very popular in European and numerous other countries in spas, clinics, medical institutions, and training centers. Beyond the clinical benefits of cold therapy, users generally report the experience as invigorating with improvement in a variety of conditions such as psychological stress, increased energy, improved sleep, and relief from muscle and joint pain. Athletes using the treatments report substantial decreased time for muscle stress recovery. The immediate effect lasts for minutes to hours, and the release of endorphins can have a lasting effect.</p>
<p><b>The best part: as long as people don’t have an underlying condition that precludes them from exposure to such cold, it has no known side effects.</b></p>
<p><b>More about the Project</b></p>
<p>Did you know? The world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, used a mobile cryosauna at the 2012 London Olympics for relief from a back injury and actor Daniel Craig used whole body cryotherapy to prepare for and maintain his physique for his role in the latest James Bond film, Skyfall and finally Olympic coach and marathon champion Alberto Salazar employed whole body crytherapy when coaching Olympic medalists Galen Ruup and Mo Farah at Nike's Oregon training facility.– This fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution.  This is where we started to envision “Northern Virginia Cryotherapy” and all the possible benefits we could bring to people:</p>
<p>Reduces inflammation </p>
<p>Increases energy </p>
<p>Lessens muscle soreness and tension </p>
<p>Relieves pain from injuries or joint disorders </p>
<p>Boosts metabolism and contributes to weight loss </p>
<p>Increases collagen production, reducing cellulite and signs of aging </p>
<p>Improves mood via a rise in endorphins </p>
<p>Has an anti-oxide effect, which can slow aging and help prevent osteoporosis </p>
<p>Has also been used to help elevate testosterone levels in men </p>
<p>Supports the treatment of multiple sclerosis </p>
<p>Helps solve insomnia, migraines, gout and asthma </p>
<p>When reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us that this is a second location and service that needs to be created. We feel if executed properly we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier way to live.  Our features will make us incredibly qualified to succeed in the industry.  This paired with attention to detail and quality service will make us a key player if not leader in the industry. Our mission is to take care of every funder, supporter and customer with the upmost respect and care.  We feel this will be the key to our growth.</p>
<p><b>About Us</b></p>
<p>This project really hits home for me because as a cancer survivor and veteran who has dedicated his life in the pursuit to help others. I have researched many traditional and unconventional therapies. Most therapies have no scientific merit. Everyone is familiar with ICY HOT in the pursuit to achieve temporary relief from pain. I experienced 1st hand in Dallas at CryoUSA the potential of WBC. I became a massage therapist for all of the above reasons.</p>
<p>I'm originally from Beaumont, TX. Southern raised veteran who served in Afghanistan who still believes this world would be a better place if everyone took the time to help one another.  And that is really why I am opening this location.  During 2013, I was diagnosed with Non Hodgkins' lymphoma. </p>
<p>I received my remission last November after about 8 months of aggressive chemotherapy. During and after my treatments, I discovered a bad side effect from one of the drugs, Oncospar. It causes peripheral neuropathy at the bottom of your feet and palms of the hands. I began to research with Google searches over the scientific websites like NIH for any known cures. They were none listed. If someone looses too much sensation from their nerve endings, it can drastically cause a loss of motor functions to your hands and feet. For example, you won't be able to even button your shirt. Well, I thought about it and I figured that I could either be a victim or do something about it. I tried playing the guitar and it worked for my hands for a while but nothing but Reflexology worked temporarily on my feet, so I did some more homework and found out about Whole Body Cryotherapy assisting folks with neurological damage. I figured since I was traveling to TX to visit family I would give it a test run in Dallas. I was a bit skeptical until 48 hours out the chamber. I started gaining more sensation in my feet. Prior to my 2 treatments, my feet felt like 4 pair of socks.</p>
<p>As you can see from my story, this location is not only opening as a business venture but out of necessity.  I even have friends who suffer from skin conditions and diabetes who I know could benefit from these treatments. My company is nested in the neighborhood for a reason, My motto is a veteran owned company serving the community. I don't want crowdfunding to just purchase new equipment. I'm on a mission to aid the local communities medical and military alike.</p>
<p><b>How You Can Help</b></p>

The world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, used a mobile cryosauna at the 2012 London Olympics for relief from a back injury and actor Daniel Craig used whole body cryotherapy to prepare for and maintain his physique for his role in the latest James Bond film, Skyfall and finally Olympic coach and marathon champion Alberto Salazar employed whole body crytherapy when coaching Olympic medalists Galen Ruup and Mo Farah at Nike's Oregon training facility.– This fact prompted us to dig deeper into a solution.  This is where we started to envision “Northern Virginia Cryotherapy” and all the possible benefits we could bring to people:
Reduces inflammation 
Increases energy 
Lessens muscle soreness and tension 
Relieves pain from injuries or joint disorders 
Boosts metabolism and contributes to weight loss 
Increases collagen production, reducing cellulite and signs of aging 
Improves mood via a rise in endorphins 
Has an anti-oxide effect, which can slow aging and help prevent osteoporosis 
Has also been used to help elevate testosterone levels in men 
Supports the treatment of multiple sclerosis 
Helps solve insomnia, migraines, gout and asthma 
When reviewing these benefits, features and much more, it inspired and assured us that this is a second location and service that needs to be created. We feel if executed properly we can reach a large market of people in need of an easier way to live.  Our features will make us incredibly qualified to succeed in the industry.  This paired with attention to detail and quality service will make us a key player if not leader in the industry. Our mission is to take care of every funder, supporter and customer with the upmost respect and care.  We feel this will be the key to our growth.
About Us
This project really hits home for me because as a cancer survivor and veteran who has dedicated his life in the pursuit to help others. I have researched many traditional and unconventional therapies. Most therapies have no scientific merit. Everyone is familiar with ICY HOT in the pursuit to achieve temporary relief from pain. I experienced 1st hand in Dallas at CryoUSA the potential of WBC. I became a massage therapist for all of the above reasons.
I'm originally from Beaumont, TX. Southern raised veteran who served in Afghanistan who still believes this world would be a better place if everyone took the time to help one another.  And that is really why I am opening this location.  During 2013, I was diagnosed with Non Hodgkins' lymphoma. 
I received my remission last November after about 8 months of aggressive chemotherapy. During and after my treatments, I discovered a bad side effect from one of the drugs, Oncospar. It causes peripheral neuropathy at the bottom of your feet and palms of the hands. I began to research with Google searches over the scientific websites like NIH for any known cures. They were none listed. If someone looses too much sensation from their nerve endings, it can drastically cause a loss of motor functions to your hands and feet. For example, you won't be able to even button your shirt. Well, I thought about it and I figured that I could either be a victim or do something about it. I tried playing the guitar and it worked for my hands for a while but nothing but Reflexology worked temporarily on my feet, so I did some more homework and found out about Whole Body Cryotherapy assisting folks with neurological damage. I figured since I was traveling to TX to visit family I would give it a test run in Dallas. I was a bit skeptical until 48 hours out the chamber. I started gaining more sensation in my feet. Prior to my 2 treatments, my feet felt like 4 pair of socks.
As you can see from my story, this location is not only opening as a business venture but out of necessity.  I even have friends who suffer from skin conditions and diabetes who I know could benefit from these treatments. My company is nested in the neighborhood for a reason, My motto is a veteran owned company serving the community. I don't want crowdfunding to just purchase new equipment. I'm on a mission to aid the local communities medical and military alike.

<p>Seattle Children’s PlayGarden is a public garden and play space designed for children with special needs. Covering an acre of land in south central Seattle, the PlayGarden was created in 2002 as an outdoor, inclusive place for <i>all</i> kids  to play their way – kids on two feet, kids with walkers, kids in wheelchairs and kids who communicate differently.  It’s a place where children of all abilities are free to follow their imaginations, wherever they may lead, and engage in the most important work of childhood:  Play.  From the top of our Mt. Jordan to the natural wonderland of the Wild Zone, the PlayGarden is a place where <b>magic happens daily</b></p>

is a tremendous resource for the immediate community, who frequently come here
to play, enjoy the garden, and meet their neighbors. Conveniently located near
I-90 and I-5, families of all shapes, sizes, and abilities come from all over

<p>We built Skybeam™ because we were frustrated with constantly managing temporary solutions for getting web content on TV’s.

All you need is a credit card and a email address.  We don't think businesses should be left out of the amazing community of forward thinkers here on Indiegogo.  Business supporting business just makes sense!</p><h3><b>Q: Is Skybeam™ just for businesses?</b></h3><p>A: Why of course not!  Just because Skybeam™ is a business class product does not mean that individuals can’t take advantage of putting their data (or even family memories) on the big screen. Skybeam™ is built with business services in mind and our current integrations are business focused. That being said, since Skybeam™ can display anything the web can throw at it, the possibilities are almost endless as to what you can display with Skybeam™.</p><h3><b>Q: Why is Skybeam™ more expensive than consumer streaming devices?  </b></h3><p>A: In order to ensure that our product was truly business class and capable of displaying all of the web, we needed to choose high-performance hardware that holds-up to the rigor of 24/7 use and will seamlessly display the high-demand content you will throw at it. This means that our hardware is more expensive than typical consumer grade devices. </p><h3><b>Q: Why is there a monthly service cost?</b></h3><p>A: The Skybeam™  Receiver is tightly integrated with the Skybeam™ web service which is a requirement for operation.  Your Skybeam™ Receiver is constantly connected to the Skybeam™ web service which allows us to provide the growing number of platform features in real-time.  This level of service is part of why Skybeam™ is a business class device.  Running this service costs money and the developers that are working to constantly improve and ensure the reliability of the platform like to eat too. This monthly service cost enables us to provide you with a world class product and meet the demands of your business today and in the future.</p><h3><b>Q: What is the cost of the Skybeam™ service?</b></h3><p>A: The Skybeam™ Receiver requires a service plan for operation.  Our standard service plan will be $12/mo per Receiver at launch with discounts for purchasing 6-month or 1-year plans.  Each Indiegogo supporter will be provided 6 months of free Standard Service with their Skybeam™ Receiver Reward. </p><h3><b>Q: What does “Lifetime Service” mean?</b></h3><p>A: If you back us at a level where “Lifetime Service” is one of the rewards, you will receive a Lifetime service plan for the devices you receive as your reward. This lifetime service plan is an Indiegogo exclusive, we will never offer this deep of a discount after the completion of the Indiegogo campaign. Lifetime service will provide the Standard Skybeam™ Service Plan for the lifetime of the device or product offering, whichever is less. The retail price for Standard Lifetime Service will be $500 after the Indiegogo Campaign.<b> </b></p><div><b>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Q: How does my Skybeam™ Receiver connect to the internet?</span><br/>
</b></div><div>
<p>A: Your Skybeam™ Receiver connects to the internet through your local network using one of two methods. You can either utilize the included ethernet adapter and use a wired connection (suggested) OR you can connect you Skybeam™ Receiver to your network via WiFi.</p>
</div><h3><b>Q: How fast should my internet connection be to run Skybeam™?</b></h3><p>A: Skybeam™ responds to the web the same way that your browser does on your computer.  If you can confidently display your web content on your computer, Skybeam™ will perform similarly.  Bandwidth requirements will be dependent on the type of content you are displaying. Static images and simple web pages will have small bandwidth footprints, while real-time tickers and streaming video content will require much greater bandwidth. </p><h3><b>Q: Can I use a cellular data service with Skybeam™?</b></h3><p>A: Direct cellular data support is on the product roadmap for Q1 2016.  Today Skybeam™ works with any cellular hotspot or modem that can connect to the Skybeam™ over WiFi or Ethernet. Please see the note on “What type of internet connection do I need to run Skybeam™?”  about bandwidth requirements as these are more of a concern over cellular connections. </p><h3><b>Q: How secure is Skybeam™?</b></h3><p>A: Skybeam™ utilizes the same security measures that the leading banking institutions use to secure your financial transactions. We strive to keep your business and personal data as safe as possible by following industry standards. You should keep in mind that Skybeam™ is a method for getting your data on big screens over the internet and we have no influence on the security of your original data sources or the location in which you display that data. We will do our best to work with 3rd party data providers to encourage them to follow best practices as well.</p><h3><b>Q: Can I request multiple Mugs or T-Shirts?</b></h3><p>A: Absolutely!  Just add multiples of $30 for mugs or $50 for T-Shirts to your pledge amount. You will receive a survey at the end of the campaign where you can specify quantities and sizes.</p><h3><b>Q: Can Skybeam™ display locally hosted content?</b></h3><p>A: Yes. Skybeam™ can display any web content that can be accessed from the network it is connected to. This may require some more advanced setup and working with your IT department or network specialist is encouraged.</p><b><br/></b><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges:</h3><p>Our team has been involved in businesses providing B2B hardware products for the last 10 years, managing the full product cycle from product development to manufacturing and fulfillment. We have considerable experience working with contract manufacturers in the US and abroad to deliver products that meet and exceed customer expectation. That being said, there is always uncertainty when it comes to manufacturing and electronics, component availability, pricing and yield are always concerns. Fortunately we are working with industry veterans who have provided products reliably for years. We will do everything in our power to deliver on the goals of this Indiegogo campaign. There is always the chance that we may have to make component substitutions, but we will never sacrifice performance or user experience. We will keep all of our backers updated throughout the process and they will be the first to be informed of any challenges that may arise. You supported us and we will support you.

Why Skybeam™?
We built Skybeam™ because we were frustrated with constantly managing temporary solutions for getting web content on TV’s. Consumer streaming devices like Chromecast or Apple TV are not designed to continuously display a single source, they get knocked off-line or go idle when the smartphone or computer leaves the office. Using a dedicated PC requires constant maintenance and carries with it hundreds to thousands of dollars in hidden maintenance and management costs annually.

Skybeam™ breaks this mold by providing a truly turn-key, zero maintenance solution. Set it up once and our technology will disappear into the background allowing your web content to take center stage. The Skybeam™ Receiver functions like an appliance, just add power and the internet and your content will be consistently available. It is the first always-on, always-ready internet appliance designed to display web content 24/7.Watch our original campaign video to learn more:

That being said, since Skybeam™ can display anything the web can throw at it, the possibilities are almost endless as to what you can display with Skybeam™.Q: Why is Skybeam™ more expensive than consumer streaming devices?  A: In order to ensure that our product was truly business class and capable of displaying all of the web, we needed to choose high-performance hardware that holds-up to the rigor of 24/7 use and will seamlessly display the high-demand content you will throw at it. This means that our hardware is more expensive than typical consumer grade devices. Q: Why is there a monthly service cost?A: The Skybeam™  Receiver is tightly integrated with the Skybeam™ web service which is a requirement for operation.  Your Skybeam™ Receiver is constantly connected to the Skybeam™ web service which allows us to provide the growing number of platform features in real-time.  This level of service is part of why Skybeam™ is a business class device.  Running this service costs money and the developers that are working to constantly improve and ensure the reliability of the platform like to eat too. This monthly service cost enables us to provide you with a world class product and meet the demands of your business today and in the future.Q: What is the cost of the Skybeam™ service?A: The Skybeam™ Receiver requires a service plan for operation.  Our standard service plan will be $12/mo per Receiver at launch with discounts for purchasing 6-month or 1-year plans.  Each Indiegogo supporter will be provided 6 months of free Standard Service with their Skybeam™ Receiver Reward. Q: What does “Lifetime Service” mean?A: If you back us at a level where “Lifetime Service” is one of the rewards, you will receive a Lifetime service plan for the devices you receive as your reward. This lifetime service plan is an Indiegogo exclusive, we will never offer this deep of a discount after the completion of the Indiegogo campaign. Lifetime service will provide the Standard Skybeam™ Service Plan for the lifetime of the device or product offering, whichever is less. The retail price for Standard Lifetime Service will be $500 after the Indiegogo Campaign. 
Q: How does my Skybeam™ Receiver connect to the internet?

A: Your Skybeam™ Receiver connects to the internet through your local network using one of two methods. You can either utilize the included ethernet adapter and use a wired connection (suggested) OR you can connect you Skybeam™ Receiver to your network via WiFi.
Q: How fast should my internet connection be to run Skybeam™?A: Skybeam™ responds to the web the same way that your browser does on your computer.  If you can confidently display your web content on your computer, Skybeam™ will perform similarly.  Bandwidth requirements will be dependent on the type of content you are displaying. Static images and simple web pages will have small bandwidth footprints, while real-time tickers and streaming video content will require much greater bandwidth. Q: Can I use a cellular data service with Skybeam™?A: Direct cellular data support is on the product roadmap for Q1 2016.  Today Skybeam™ works with any cellular hotspot or modem that can connect to the Skybeam™ over WiFi or Ethernet. Please see the note on “What type of internet connection do I need to run Skybeam™?”  about bandwidth requirements as these are more of a concern over cellular connections. Q: How secure is Skybeam™?A: Skybeam™ utilizes the same security measures that the leading banking institutions use to secure your financial transactions. We strive to keep your business and personal data as safe as possible by following industry standards. You should keep in mind that Skybeam™ is a method for getting your data on big screens over the internet and we have no influence on the security of your original data sources or the location in which you display that data. We will do our best to work with 3rd party data providers to encourage them to follow best practices as well.Q: Can I request multiple Mugs or T-Shirts?A: Absolutely!  Just add multiples of $30 for mugs or $50 for T-Shirts to your pledge amount. You will receive a survey at the end of the campaign where you can specify quantities and sizes.Q: Can Skybeam™ display locally hosted content?A: Yes. Skybeam™ can display any web content that can be accessed from the network it is connected to. This may require some more advanced setup and working with your IT department or network specialist is encouraged.Risks and challenges:Our team has been involved in businesses providing B2B hardware products for the last 10 years, managing the full product cycle from product development to manufacturing and fulfillment. We have considerable experience working with contract manufacturers in the US and abroad to deliver products that meet and exceed customer expectation. That being said, there is always uncertainty when it comes to manufacturing and electronics, component availability, pricing and yield are always concerns. Fortunately we are working with industry veterans who have provided products reliably for years. We will do everything in our power to deliver on the goals of this Indiegogo campaign. There is always the chance that we may have to make component substitutions, but we will never sacrifice performance or user experience. We will keep all of our backers updated throughout the process and they will be the first to be informed of any challenges that may arise. You supported us and we will support you.

<p>Publishing
suffers from a major diversity problem. Statistics show that the vast majority
of books published are by white authors and about white characters. Part of the
problem is that the majority of the staff behind the scenes, including publishers’
employees and reviewers, is also white. When almost all of the gatekeepers and
decision-makers are white, it is no wonder that on average only 10% of
children’s books published each year are by or about people of color.</p>
<p>For
decades there has been overwhelming agreement in the industry that there should
be more diversity at all levels in the book world, but the problem never seems
to go away. Where do we even start? </p>
<p>If
we are serious about trying to address the lack of diversity in the publishing world,
creating <b>Ubuntu Press</b> is but one
first step we need to take. Sharing our numbers as an industry will not only
clue us in to important patterns that we may be missing, it will also show that
we are committed to change.</p>
<p>In
the past, publishers have usually put the responsibility on readers for the
lack of diverse representation in books. The extremely dated adage that
“diverse books do not sell” has become a belief that has reached mythical
proportions. While it’s important for readers to support diverse books with
their dollars and voices, it’s equally important for publishers to self-reflect
on how they can do better on their end. We must acknowledge that one factor
contributing to the lack of diverse books is the lack of diversity among the
people who edit, market, review, and sell the books. </p>
<p>The
goal of <b>Ubuntu Press</b> is to serve as editor,
marketer, reviewer, and seller of books from often marginalized communities
which is inclusive of genre, gender, race/ethnicity,
sexual
orientation, disability. To facilitate writer,
poets, and artist who would like to pursue self-publishing their work. Ultimately,
<b>Ubuntu Press</b> aims to increase
diverse books in the children’s and adult book world.</p>
<p>Through
your support and participation in this campaign we can work together to put in
place sustainable programs that will increase diversity among publishing staffs
in the long-term. Together, we can create a more inclusive book publishing
industry.</p>
<p>“Ubuntu [...] speaks of the very essence of
being human. [We] say [...] ""Hey, so-and-so has <b>ubuntu</b>."" Then you are generous, you are hospitable, you are
friendly and caring and compassionate. You share what you have. It is to say,
""My humanity is caught up, is inextricably bound up, in yours."" We
belong in a bundle of life. We say, ""A person is a person through other
persons.""</p>
<p>[...] A person with <b>ubuntu</b> is open and available to others, affirming of others, does
not feel threatened that others are able and good, for he or she has a proper
self-assurance that comes from knowing that he or she belongs in a greater
whole and is diminished when others are humiliated or diminished, when others
are tortured or oppressed, or treated as if they were less than who they are.”</p>

Creating a small business which is Ubuntu Press was the answer. Yours
support will allow Ubuntu Press to
seek the voices and stories of those under- represented in publishing. Together
will be allow the stories and history of our collective community to be told. 
The impact of Ubuntu Press will be creating and building community through
publishing where, “A person is a person through other people' strikes an
affirmation of one’s humanity through recognition of an ‘other’ in his or her
uniqueness and difference. It is a demand for a creative inter-subjective
formation in which the ‘other’ becomes a mirror (but only a mirror) for my

<p><a href=""http://newskid.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NEWSKID</a> is a transmedia project that wants to engage children in current affairs using Augmented Reality over three fun interactive platforms: a website, a prop and a newspaper. These are combined to create a very immersive story world that makes the news accessible for children. Right now we have the prototype almost ready and we want you to be the first one to try it. If you get any of the perks you will be helping us to keep going.</p>We have created a character from another planet, Nushu, whose mission is to report back to its people about what is happening on Earth. It enlists the help of young readers to help it create its reports, prompting children to learn about international current affairs in a fun way and to participate in news reporting.<p><br/></p>

<h3><span>MORE ADVANTAGES FOR YOU</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Moreover, if NEWSKID keeps going with your help and we can offer service to individuals at any moment next year, you will receive special treatment. We will give you free access to content. We can’t be more precise because the future is uncertain and there are things we don’t know yet. We will keep working every day to make NEWSKID a long lasting project. We will keep you informed. We want you to be part of it.</span></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3><span>WHAT WE COULD ACHIEVE WITH YOUR HELP </span></h3>
<p>The prototype is successful amongst children. Right now we need to adjust technology, improve user experience, make new reports and let people know about NEWSKID. We also want to incorporate new platforms, such as Virtual Reality, and produce an audiovisual for television.</p>
<p>Even though we have worked a lot, we have to keep walking. Our goal is to make NEWSKID become an international source for kids to know what happens in the world in a fun way.</p>
<p>We need your help in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Upgrade our 3D character, Nushu -</b> We are making it more fun, more dynamic, with more movements.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Improve the technology -</b>  We are making Nushu more realistic, improving the app and creating an iphone version of our prototype.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Creating first short Nushu’ stories so everybody knows about it  -</b> We will increase Nushu’s profile through a Youtube channel with short videos.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Creating a public website</b> about Nushu so that family, schools and media interested can reach us.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Partner with media organisations -</b> We intend to distribute NEWSKID as a print supplement to newspapers and as a TV show for broadcasters.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Spread the word -</b> Tell anyone that you think could be interested in Nushu. Share this campaign on social networks. Tell schools and media you know about to contact us!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is how we are distributing the resources of the campaign:</p>

<h3><span>OUR STORY</span></h3>
<p>The project is the brainchild of <b>Eva Domínguez</b>, a multimedia journalist with 25 years’ experience of making the news more engaging through the use of strong storytelling techniques combined with emerging technologies.  </p>
<blockquote>“We use different platforms. Each of them has a role in the storytelling. We combine also physical objects with digital screens. Augmented Reality is incorporated into the physical prop and newspaper giving news coverage an almost game-like feel motivating children to do their own research and report back on the important issues of the day in order to help Nushu complete its mission.”</blockquote>
<p>NEWSKID has been showcased at different global events this past summer with great impact. Now we are facing the challenge of launching the service.</p>This was achieved through personal investment from founder Eva Domínguez and an European grant (under the CreatiFi program) of 50,000€. <br/>

<p>Aunque hemos hecho un largo camino, todavía nos queda mucho por recorrer. Nuestro objetivo es hacer de NEWSKID un recurso internacional para que los niños puedan acceder fácilmente y de forma entretenida a las noticias.</p>
<p>Con los beneficios de la venta del prototipo a través de esta campaña de micromecenazgo podremos:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Crear los primeros vídeos de Nushu para que todo el mundo lo conozca:</b> Crearemos un canal de Youtube que periódicamente se actualizará con pequeñas aventuras del extraterrestre.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Crear una web pública:</b> De este modo, los niños, familias, y escuelas interesados podrán encontrarnos.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Mejorar a Nushu:</b> Lo queremos hacer más divertido y más dinámico.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Afinar la tecnología:</b> Necesitamos pulir la aplicación para Android y crear una para móviles y tabletas de Apple.</p></li>

<h3><span>NUESTRA HISTORIA</span></h3>
<p>El proyecto es una idea de <b>Eva Domínguez</b>, una periodista multimedia con 25 años de experiencia, especializada en narrativas emergentes y en nuevas tecnologías aplicadas al periodismo.</p>
<blockquote>“Utilizamos varias plataformas, y cada una tiene su función en la narrativa. Combinamos objetos físicos con pantallas digitales. La realidad aumentada convierte las noticias en una experiencia lúdica y motiva a los niños a investigar por su cuenta sobre los temas de actualidad. También fomenta su papel activo, ya que pueden explicar a Nushu lo que han descubierto, ayudándole a completar su misión"".</blockquote>
<p>NEWSKID participó con éxito en varios encuentros internacionales el verano pasado. Ahora estamos ante el reto de lanzar el servicio comercialmente.</p>
<p>Hemos trabajado en NEWSKID durante un año. Este prototipo se ha conseguido gracias a la inversión personal de la fundadora, Eva Domínguez, y a una ayuda europea (dentro del programa CreatiFi) de 50.000€.</p>

Help us make a difference to the way kids engage with current affairs. Through special news reports incorporating Augmented Reality we can make the news engaging and meaningful to children.





NEWSKID is a transmedia project that wants to engage children in current affairs using Augmented Reality over three fun interactive platforms: a website, a prop and a newspaper. These are combined to create a very immersive story world that makes the news accessible for children. Right now we have the prototype almost ready and we want you to be the first one to try it. If you get any of the perks you will be helping us to keep going.We have created a character from another planet, Nushu, whose mission is to report back to its people about what is happening on Earth. It enlists the help of young readers to help it create its reports, prompting children to learn about international current affairs in a fun way and to participate in news reporting.


When using our Android app, Nushu appears in 3D on top of the front page.
The print cube becomes an interactive prop with Augmented Reality. In the interactive website children play the role of Nushu exploring the news.


WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?

It stimulates an interest in current affairs -  Kids are easily motivated to understanding what’s going on in the world thanks to our engaging storytelling.
It encourages critical thinking - NEWSKID aims to stimulate children’s minds in order to train them to be free thinkers now and in their future.
Children become active participants in the news coverage  - We want children to be an active part of NEWSKID and bring them on board of the writing and producing of news broadcasts in a playful way.
It uses the latest technologies  - NEWSKID is one of the first companies to bring Augmented Reality to the areas of news and education taking them to the next level.
Children have fun with it!  - And that’s crucial for us. We believe that fun is the path to a happier and and aware future citizen.







WHAT ARE THE PERKS?
Help us by choosing one of our perks (they use an Android app).

In the postcard, Nushu makes a short introduction about himself through Augmented Reality (1 AR interaction).
With the print issue (an A4 newspaper frontpage) you’ll explore Nushu’s findings on its first mission: understanding what ebola is about (3 AR interactions).
With the interactive cube, children can play with Nushu (6 AR interactions).
You may also shape how NEWSKID will develop in the future by making suggestions to the NEWSKID team.
We’ll be also excited to have a videocall to talk about NEWSKID and how can we engage children in current affairs.



MORE ADVANTAGES FOR YOU


Moreover, if NEWSKID keeps going with your help and we can offer service to individuals at any moment next year, you will receive special treatment. We will give you free access to content. We can’t be more precise because the future is uncertain and there are things we don’t know yet. We will keep working every day to make NEWSKID a long lasting project. We will keep you informed. We want you to be part of it.



WHAT WE COULD ACHIEVE WITH YOUR HELP 
The prototype is successful amongst children. Right now we need to adjust technology, improve user experience, make new reports and let people know about NEWSKID. We also want to incorporate new platforms, such as Virtual Reality, and produce an audiovisual for television.
Even though we have worked a lot, we have to keep walking. Our goal is to make NEWSKID become an international source for kids to know what happens in the world in a fun way.
We need your help in order to:

Upgrade our 3D character, Nushu - We are making it more fun, more dynamic, with more movements.
Improve the technology -  We are making Nushu more realistic, improving the app and creating an iphone version of our prototype.
Creating first short Nushu’ stories so everybody knows about it  - We will increase Nushu’s profile through a Youtube channel with short videos.
Creating a public website about Nushu so that family, schools and media interested can reach us.
Partner with media organisations - We intend to distribute NEWSKID as a print supplement to newspapers and as a TV show for broadcasters.
Spread the word - Tell anyone that you think could be interested in Nushu. Share this campaign on social networks. Tell schools and media you know about to contact us!

This is how we are distributing the resources of the campaign:

OUR STORY
The project is the brainchild of Eva Domínguez, a multimedia journalist with 25 years’ experience of making the news more engaging through the use of strong storytelling techniques combined with emerging technologies.  
“We use different platforms. Each of them has a role in the storytelling. We combine also physical objects with digital screens. Augmented Reality is incorporated into the physical prop and newspaper giving news coverage an almost game-like feel motivating children to do their own research and report back on the important issues of the day in order to help Nushu complete its mission.”
NEWSKID has been showcased at different global events this past summer with great impact. Now we are facing the challenge of launching the service.This was achieved through personal investment from founder Eva Domínguez and an European grant (under the CreatiFi program) of 50,000€. 



CHILDREN LOVE IT!

“The game on the cube was really cool!” - Anna

“Having a small alien explain the news through games, exercises and by asking questions is so much more convenient and fun than just watching someone on television speaking into a microphone” - Cristina 

“I like NEWSKID because it has pictures and vocabulary that I can understand” - Alexandra

THE TEAM

From left to right: Nushu, Eva Domínguez, Océane Apffel, Laia Ros and Maria Villuendas. Visit our profiles to know more about us. 

TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE IT!
However we look at it, to invest in children’s education is to invest in our common future: The world of tomorrow will inherit the children of today. Whether nations grow and prosper will depend heavily on the education of their citizens.Help us reach our goal and help engage the next generation of global citizens.

ESPAÑOL


Ayúdanos a cambiar cómo los niños se relacionan con las noticias. A través de unos reportajes con realidad aumentada podemos hacer que encuentren el sentido de la actualidad informativa y se diviertan.


NEWSKID es un proyecto transmedia que quiere acercar la actualidad informativa a los niños de forma entretenida e innovadora. Se desarrolla en tres plataformas: un diario, un objeto físico y una web. Las tres plataformas se combinan para explicar los temas internacionales con realidad aumentada. Ahora tenemos el prototipo casi acabado y queremos que seas el primero en probarlo. Si adquieres alguna de las recompensas nos ayudarás a seguir adelante con este proyecto.
Hemos creado Nushu, un extraterrestre cuya misión es explicar a su especie lo que pasa en la Tierra. Para ello, pide la ayuda a los niños, que  aprenden sobre asuntos internacionales de forma divertida a la vez que descubren el proceso de elaboración de las noticias. 

Al utilizar la aplicación de Android, Nushu aparece en 3D sobre la portada. El cubo se convierte en un objeto interactivo con realidad aumentada. 

En la web interactiva, los niños asumen el rol de Nushu en su misión. 

¿CUÁLES SON SUS VENTAJAS? 
Estimula el interés por las noticias  -  Los niños se sienten motivados para entender lo que pasa en el mundo gracias al relato de aventuras. 
Promueve el pensamiento crítico  - NEWSKID pretende incentivar a los niños para que puedan desarrollar un criterio propio ahora y en el futuro. 
Los niños participan en la cobertura informativa - Queremos que sean parte activa de NEWSKID invitándoles a crear sus propias piezas informativas. 
Utiliza las últimas tecnologías  - NEWSKID es una de las primeras empresas en aplicar la realidad aumentada en el sector de las noticias y la educación.
Los niños se divierten - Esto es sumamente importante, porque un niño que se divierte será un niño feliz y un ciudadano más responsable. 




¿CUÁLES SON LAS RECOMPENSAS?
Ayúdanos eligiendo una de estas recompensas (la app funciona para Android): 

En la postal, Nushu se presenta a través de la realidad aumentada  (una interacción con RA).
En el papel (una portada en tamaño A4) podrás conocer los descubrimientos de Nushu en su primera misión: entender qué es el ébola (3 interacciones con RA).
Con el cubo interactivo, los niños pueden jugar con Nushu (6 interacciones con RA).
También puedes ser parte del desarrollo futuro de NEWSKID con tus sugerencias.
Estaremos encantadas de realizar una videoconferencia para hablar de cómo NEWSKID puede involucrar a los niños en las noticias. 






MÁS VENTAJAS PARA TI
Además, si NEWSKID sigue adelante con tu ayuda y podemos ofrecer un servicio a particulares en algún momento del año que viene, tendrás un trato especial por habernos apoyado. Te daremos acceso gratis a contenidos. No podemos ser mucho más precisos porque el futuro es incierto y hay aspectos que aún no sabemos. Seguimos trabajando día a día para que NEWSKID tenga un largo recorrido. Te iremos informando de todo lo que hagamos. Queremos que tú formes parte de él.  


QUÉ PODRÍAMOS HACER CON VUESTRA AYUDA 
El prototipo tiene éxito entre los niños. Ahora necesitamos ajustar la tecnología, mejorar la experiencia de usuario, elaborar nuevos reportajes y dar a conocer NEWSKID. También queremos incorporar nuevas plataformas, como la realidad virtual y un audiovisual para televisión.
Aunque hemos hecho un largo camino, todavía nos queda mucho por recorrer. Nuestro objetivo es hacer de NEWSKID un recurso internacional para que los niños puedan acceder fácilmente y de forma entretenida a las noticias.
Con los beneficios de la venta del prototipo a través de esta campaña de micromecenazgo podremos:

Crear los primeros vídeos de Nushu para que todo el mundo lo conozca: Crearemos un canal de Youtube que periódicamente se actualizará con pequeñas aventuras del extraterrestre.
Crear una web pública: De este modo, los niños, familias, y escuelas interesados podrán encontrarnos.
Mejorar a Nushu: Lo queremos hacer más divertido y más dinámico.
Afinar la tecnología: Necesitamos pulir la aplicación para Android y crear una para móviles y tabletas de Apple.
Llegar a acuerdos con medios de comunicación: Queremos distribuir NEWSKID como un suplemento de papel para diarios y como un programa para cadenas de televisión.
Difundir el proyecto: Da a conocer NEWSKID a quien creas que le puede interesar. Comparte la campaña en las redes sociales. Enseña el producto a escuelas y medios de comunicación que conozcas para que se pongan en contacto con nosotros.

Así distribuiremos los ingresos de la campaña:


NUESTRA HISTORIA
El proyecto es una idea de Eva Domínguez, una periodista multimedia con 25 años de experiencia, especializada en narrativas emergentes y en nuevas tecnologías aplicadas al periodismo.
“Utilizamos varias plataformas, y cada una tiene su función en la narrativa. Combinamos objetos físicos con pantallas digitales. La realidad aumentada convierte las noticias en una experiencia lúdica y motiva a los niños a investigar por su cuenta sobre los temas de actualidad. También fomenta su papel activo, ya que pueden explicar a Nushu lo que han descubierto, ayudándole a completar su misión"".
NEWSKID participó con éxito en varios encuentros internacionales el verano pasado. Ahora estamos ante el reto de lanzar el servicio comercialmente.
Hemos trabajado en NEWSKID durante un año. Este prototipo se ha conseguido gracias a la inversión personal de la fundadora, Eva Domínguez, y a una ayuda europea (dentro del programa CreatiFi) de 50.000€.

¡A LOS NIÑOS LES ENCANTA!

“El juego que aparece en el cubo mola” - Anna


“Que un extraterrestre explique las noticias a través de juegos, ejercicios y preguntando cosas es mejor que ver a alguien de la tele hablando con un micro”- Cristina

CATALÀ
Ajuda'ns a canviar la relació que tenen els nens amb les notícies. A través d'uns reportatges amb realitat augmentada podem fer que trobin sentit en l'actualitat informativa i es diverteixin.
NEWSKID és un projecte transmèdia que vol acostar l'actualitat informativa als nens de forma entretinguda i innovadora. Hi ha tres plataformes: un diari, un objecte físic i una web. Les tres plataformes es combinen per explicar els temes internacionals amb realitat augmentada. Tenim el prototip gairebé llest i volem que siguis el primer a provar-lo. Si compres alguna de les recompenses ens ajudaràs a seguir endavant amb el projecte.
Hem creat al Nushu, un extraterrestre la missió del qual és explicar a la seva espècie què passa a la Terra. Per fer-ho, demana ajuda als nens, que aprenen sobre assumptes internacionals de forma divertida, a la vegada que descobreixen el procés de creació de les notícies.


En utilitzar l'aplicació d'Android, en Nushu apareix en 3D a sobre de la portada.
El cub es converteix en un objecte interactiu amb realitat augmentada. 
A la web interactiva, els nens agafen el rol d'en Nushu per portar a terme la seva missió.


QUINS SÓN ELS SEUS AVANTATGES?


Estimula l'interès per les notícies - Els nens se senten motivats per entendre allò que passa al món gràcies a les aventures d'en Nushu.

Promou el pensament crític - NEWSKID pretén incentivar als nens per tal que puguin desenvolupar un criteri propi ara i en el futur.

Els nens participen en la cobertura informativa - Volem que siguin part activa de NEWSKID, ja que els convidem a crear les seves pròpies peces informatives.


Utilitza les tecnologies més avançades - NEWSKID és una de les primeres empreses que apliquen la realitat augmentada dintre dels sectors de la informació i de l'educació.
Els nens es diverteixen - Això és importantíssim, ja que un nen que es diverteixi serà una persona més feliç i un ciutadà més responsable.




QUINES SÓN LES RECOMPENSES?
Ajuda'ns i tria una d'aquestes recompenses (l’app funciona per Android):


A la postal, en Nushu es presenta a través de la realitat augmentada (una interacció amb RA).
Al paper (una portada a mida A4), podràs conèixer els descobriments que ha fet en Nushu durant la seva primera missió: entendre què és l'Ebola (3 interaccions amb RA)

Amb el cub interactiu, els nens poden jugar amb en Nushu (6 interaccions amb RA).


També podràs ajudar a dissenyar el futur desenvolupament de NEWSKID amb els teus suggeriments.

Estarem encantades de realitzar una videoconferència per parlar de com NEWSKID pot involucrar els nens amb les notícies.





MÉS AVANTATGES PER A TU
A més a més, si NEWSKID va endavant gràcies a la teva ajuda i podem oferir un servei a particulars a partir de l'any que ve, rebràs un tracte especial per haver-nos donat suport. Et donarem accés gratis a continguts. Ara mateix no podem ser més precises perquè el futur és incert i hi ha aspectes que encara no sabem. Continuem treballant dia a dia per tal que NEWSKID tingui un llarg recorregut, i t'anirem informant de tot allò que fem. Volem que en formis part.
QUÈ PODREM FER AMB LA VOSTRA AJUDA
Als nens els hi encanta el prototip, però encara necessitem ajustar la tecnologia, millorar l'experiència d'usuari, elaborar nous reportatges i donar a conèixer NEWSKID. També volem incorporar noves plataformes, com la realitat virtual i un audiovisual per a la televisió.
Encara que hem fet un camí molt llarg, encara ens queda molt per fer. El nostre objectiu és que NEWSKID es converteixi en un recurs internacional per tal que els nens i nenes de tot el món puguin accedir a les notícies de forma fàcil i entretinguda.
Amb els beneficis obtinguts per la venta del prototip a través d'aquesta campanya, podrem:


Crear els primers vídeos d'en Nushu per tal que tothom el conegui: Farem un canal de Youtube que s'actualitzarà periòdicament amb petites aventures de l'extraterrestre.

Crear una web pública: D'aquesta manera, els nens, les famílies i les escoles interessades ens podran trobar més fàcilment. 


Millorar a en Nushu: Volem fer-lo més divertit i més dinàmic.

Afinar la tecnologia: Necessitem polir l'aplicació per a Android i crear-ne una per a mòbils i tabletes de Apple.
Arribar a acords amb mitjans de comunicació: Volem distribuir NEWSKID com un suplement per a diaris i com a programa per a cadenes de televisió.

We acknowledge and appreciate good food. We love to cook and we know that the right combination of patience, passion and good ingredients are necessary to create a great meal, a delicious condiment, a real ketchup. We cook our ketchup for people who recognise the contradiction between high quality and low price, people who buy their vegetables from the farmer, not the discounter, people who don’t follow trends but create them.</p><p><i><b>Curtice Brothers - Established in 1868</b></i></p><p>Our project began with the rudimentary of questions: what is Ketchup?</p><p>Wikipedia delivered a brief elaboration on the terminology and a small picture of a Ketchup advertisement by the Curtice Brothers from 1868. Without any particular intention, we followed this nostalgic reference and found that this brand had been abandoned years ago. We decided to continue their story and became the new Curtice Brothers. This is what we stand for:</p><p></p><ol>
<li><i>Our ketchup is hand-made.</i></li>
<li><i>We use organic ingredients from Tuscany – “La Dolce Vita” in a bottle.</i></li>
<li><i>The flavours vary just like the weather and the seasons.</i></li>
<li><i>We approach love and cooking with the same reckless abandon.</i></li>
<li><i>Natural ingredients define the flavor.</i></li>
<li><i>No Compromises.</i></li>
</ol>Our recipe prescribes the use of fresh organic produce from local farmers and certified suppliers of herbs and spices - opposed to concentrated tomato paste and pulverised flavourings that are commonly used in the production of 'Ketchup'. In late summer 2014 we visited organic agricultural cooperations in northern Italy to learn more about farming in Tuscany, an area close to the open sea with sandy, mineral-rich, sub-alkaline soil which generates a great balance of sugar and acidity in their tomatoes. We met vegetable growers face to face and selected local partners who guarantee to supply the ingredients for our Ketchup in organic quality and harvested under fair labor standards.<p></p><i><b>Meet the Curtice Brothers</b></i><br/><br/><b>Mario</b> - Modern nomad - never settles for compromises<br/><br/>I grew up in a restaurant and I could not imagine any better subject to focus on than the creation of something as vital as good food.<br/><br/>When I was served the leading brand for breakfast in some hotel in remote Oman, I asked myself why people all over the world were compromising on quality over availability.With less than 21% tomatoes inside that bottle of ketchup I was convinced of a desire for a healthier and better tasting alternative. This alternative, of course, would not be aproduct to please the masses - our ketchup is intended for people who acknowledge and appreciate good food. We don't want our ketchup to end up on some dull BigMac buton a freshly prepared burger or a good steak; our ketchup comes with food you eat with pleasure, not on the run<br/><br/><b>Christoph</b> - German lunatic who believes that obstinacy is a virtue<br/><br/>In life only two things matter: Love and Food; how could we better express our love for food than through the creation of our own condiment?<br/><br/>Approximately two years ago Mario asked me to come to Vienna on an urgent matter, but he did not want to tell me what for. A few days later we met in a smoky shisha lounge where he told me what all this excitement was about: he wanted to cook ketchup!<br/><br/>Having worked with Mario on several ventures over the past decade, we both got used to patiently listen to even the craziest ideas, but this one sounded wicked.

The end result is something unique and delicious!”<br/></div>","In life only two things matter: Love and Food.Two years ago we began to experiment with the wildest recipes, tasted the worst and the best outcomes, drank too much wine, danced around the kitchen, learned how to cook Ketchup. We invited friends and family to blind tastings with an overwhelmingly positive feedback that encouraged us to continue on our quest to create a ketchup. We don't want our ketchup to end up on some dull Big Mac but on a freshly prepared burger or a great steak; our ketchup comes with food that you eat for fun, not on the run.We are hedonists. We acknowledge and appreciate good food. We love to cook and we know that the right combination of patience, passion and good ingredients are necessary to create a great meal, a delicious condiment, a real ketchup. We cook our ketchup for people who recognise the contradiction between high quality and low price, people who buy their vegetables from the farmer, not the discounter, people who don’t follow trends but create them.Curtice Brothers - Established in 1868Our project began with the rudimentary of questions: what is Ketchup?Wikipedia delivered a brief elaboration on the terminology and a small picture of a Ketchup advertisement by the Curtice Brothers from 1868. Without any particular intention, we followed this nostalgic reference and found that this brand had been abandoned years ago. We decided to continue their story and became the new Curtice Brothers. This is what we stand for:
Our ketchup is hand-made.
We use organic ingredients from Tuscany – “La Dolce Vita” in a bottle.
The flavours vary just like the weather and the seasons.
We approach love and cooking with the same reckless abandon.
Natural ingredients define the flavor.
No Compromises.
Our recipe prescribes the use of fresh organic produce from local farmers and certified suppliers of herbs and spices - opposed to concentrated tomato paste and pulverised flavourings that are commonly used in the production of 'Ketchup'. In late summer 2014 we visited organic agricultural cooperations in northern Italy to learn more about farming in Tuscany, an area close to the open sea with sandy, mineral-rich, sub-alkaline soil which generates a great balance of sugar and acidity in their tomatoes. We met vegetable growers face to face and selected local partners who guarantee to supply the ingredients for our Ketchup in organic quality and harvested under fair labor standards.Meet the Curtice BrothersMario - Modern nomad - never settles for compromisesI grew up in a restaurant and I could not imagine any better subject to focus on than the creation of something as vital as good food.When I was served the leading brand for breakfast in some hotel in remote Oman, I asked myself why people all over the world were compromising on quality over availability.With less than 21% tomatoes inside that bottle of ketchup I was convinced of a desire for a healthier and better tasting alternative. This alternative, of course, would not be aproduct to please the masses - our ketchup is intended for people who acknowledge and appreciate good food. We don't want our ketchup to end up on some dull BigMac buton a freshly prepared burger or a good steak; our ketchup comes with food you eat with pleasure, not on the runChristoph - German lunatic who believes that obstinacy is a virtueIn life only two things matter: Love and Food; how could we better express our love for food than through the creation of our own condiment?Approximately two years ago Mario asked me to come to Vienna on an urgent matter, but he did not want to tell me what for. A few days later we met in a smoky shisha lounge where he told me what all this excitement was about: he wanted to cook ketchup!Having worked with Mario on several ventures over the past decade, we both got used to patiently listen to even the craziest ideas, but this one sounded wicked. A fewshishas and a bottle of wine later we had reached a point from which there was no turning back; we decided to do it.Andreas - Swedish & living in London .. who loves a sneaky burger with a good tomato sauce.“It was easy saying yes to join my fellow brothers on the journey of bringing the Curtice Brothers ketchup back to life.

</div><h3>Welcome to Star Ridge</h3>
<p>  Hi!
We’re Star Ridge Retreat—a first of its kind sustainable Glamping adventure located
in Northern California Wine Country. But we are so much more than that. Sure,
you’ll be able to sleep in the lap of luxury in a yurt or a canvas wall tent,
and, sure, we will be able to help you find your perfect adventure for the day,
whether that adventure is a tandem skydive, zip lining through the redwood canopy,
tasting the legendary wines of Sonoma County, or simply relaxing at a spa. Do you
like watersports? Check! Hiking, biking, cycling? Check!  Sonoma
 County has all that and
more. Great restaurants, art galleries, live theatre; heck, we even have casinos
located just minutes away. But what if your sense of adventure takes you off
the beaten path just a little more? What if you are part of a group of
like-minded individuals all after the same kinds of adventures? Suppose you’ve
always wanted to learn how to keep bees? Or lead a more sustainable lifestyle?
What if you could find all of that in one place? </p>
<p>  We are working to
create just that—a place where people can be outside and feel inside. We want
to fill a small void here in Sonoma
 County. Our plan is to
make Star Ridge a destination for anyone who is tired of the same old, same
old.  This area doesn’t have enough
decent, affordable lodging to accommodate everyone who wants to come to wine
country. A recent study acknowledged that if Sonoma County
were to add 1,000 rooms to its inventory, there would still be enough demand to accommodate
them.  We want to help fill that void, just a
little: thirty-eight people at a time. At the same time, we want to demonstrate
that vacation travel doesn’t have to be wasteful. It doesn’t have to have a
detrimental impact on the environment. In fact, we want to ensure that people
who stay with us have the opportunity to learn how they can reduce their own
impact, and live a life designed to tread lightly in the world.  We plan to offer hands-on sustainable
practice classes for anyone interested. We want to introduce our Glampers to the
outside world; its wonders and its charms, its strengths and where it is weakest,
and how we, as the world's people, can help by becoming responsible stewards for the earth.</p>
<p><b>Welcome to Star Ridge
Retreat where the Inside Meets the Outside!</b></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>  We have been working with civil engineers
and an environmental scientist to create a special place where we can support nature,
clean up past damage, and restore habitat for fish and wildlife in order to be
able to come together in small groups and create a synergy that restores and
revitalizes not only us, but Mother Nature as well.  We’ve already invested tens of thousands of
dollars and countless hours to clean up the land, restore a more natural
habitat, and in planning and preliminary permitting, but our next step is to
install infrastructure. Partly because of the drought here in California, we
need an on-site water source and, in addition, plan to install a gray water
reclamation and catchment system that supports landscaping, wildlife habitat,
and contributes to water conservation. This system will be the first of its
kind in Sonoma County. Our hope is that this will not
be our last sustainable innovation—in other words, we hope to continue that
legacy of working with the county to see that even more sustainable practices
are adopted by the county and therefore approved for subsequent implementers down
the road.  </p>
<p>  This is Phase One of our endeavor. We need
your help to drill a well and get the basic infrastructure in place and to get
the gray water treatment and catchment system designed and approved by the
county.  Though we have preliminary
approval from the county to build such a system, they will still need to
approve the actual plans.  At this point,
it looks like the basic well drilling will cost about $15,000 without adding
plumbing and connections for later use which may cost another $12,000 to
install. The gray water system designs alone will cost about $10,000 with an
additional $13,000 paid to the county for the cost of the permits.  </p>
<p>  We also want to install our star-gazing
platform.  Near the top of our 25 acres,
we have a plateau perfectly suited for watching the sunset and sunrise, and for
star-gazing.  We have already started the
process of inviting a local astronomy group to come on a regular basis to guide
our Glampers through the heavens. Add another $10,000. </p>
<p>  We also want to erect our first tent site.
Depending on the funds we receive, we’d like that first site to have a Yurt. But it

what it takes to build the platform, erect the tent and install infrastructure. There's another $10,000.</p>
<p>We know that part of what drives this

donate, which means we have to inflate our goal in order to meet the demands of
our perc offerings.  Don’t get me wrong—we
will be offering some fabulous percs—skydiving, ziplining, wine tasting, etc, but mostly, we
want to offer percs that demonstrate sustainability and don’t ding the bottom

<p><b>So what’s in it for
you?</b></p>
<p>  Well, if you visit wine country, then the
obvious is the chance to take advantage of what we will be offering sometime in the
next 12 -16 months. Our overnight rates for exactly what a hotel offers: a double bed, heat and electricity—as
well as all of the other adjuncts I mentioned—will be highly competitive.  Our Yurts will go for less than
$200/night.  Also, you will be able to express
your inner altruistic self; contributing to an endeavor designed to be as
sustainable on its own as possible and to take the sustainability message to as
many people as will listen.  </p>
<p>  Our next phases will raise funds for
actually installing the gray water system, buying tents and Yurts, installing
electrical and other infrastructure, building a central pavilion where Glampers
can meet. We will have a full A/V array in that pavilion so that groups can make
powerpoint presentations or simply watch movies.  We will have walking trails and gather spots all over
the property where individuals, couples or small groups can take advantage of the scenery.  The property already boasts a
small lake and a smaller pond.  In the
future, we plan on converting the small pond into a swimming area where the
water is naturally filtered by plants and sunlight, and to install a complete

  Hi!
We’re Star Ridge Retreat—a first of its kind sustainable Glamping adventure located
in Northern California Wine Country. But we are so much more than that. Sure,
you’ll be able to sleep in the lap of luxury in a yurt or a canvas wall tent,
and, sure, we will be able to help you find your perfect adventure for the day,
whether that adventure is a tandem skydive, zip lining through the redwood canopy,
tasting the legendary wines of Sonoma County, or simply relaxing at a spa. Do you
like watersports? Check! Hiking, biking, cycling? Check!  Sonoma
 County has all that and
more. Great restaurants, art galleries, live theatre; heck, we even have casinos
located just minutes away. But what if your sense of adventure takes you off
the beaten path just a little more? What if you are part of a group of
like-minded individuals all after the same kinds of adventures? Suppose you’ve
always wanted to learn how to keep bees? Or lead a more sustainable lifestyle?
What if you could find all of that in one place? 
  We are working to
create just that—a place where people can be outside and feel inside. We want
to fill a small void here in Sonoma
 County. Our plan is to
make Star Ridge a destination for anyone who is tired of the same old, same
old.  This area doesn’t have enough
decent, affordable lodging to accommodate everyone who wants to come to wine
country. A recent study acknowledged that if Sonoma County
were to add 1,000 rooms to its inventory, there would still be enough demand to accommodate
them.  We want to help fill that void, just a
little: thirty-eight people at a time. At the same time, we want to demonstrate
that vacation travel doesn’t have to be wasteful. It doesn’t have to have a
detrimental impact on the environment. In fact, we want to ensure that people
who stay with us have the opportunity to learn how they can reduce their own
impact, and live a life designed to tread lightly in the world.  We plan to offer hands-on sustainable
practice classes for anyone interested. We want to introduce our Glampers to the
outside world; its wonders and its charms, its strengths and where it is weakest,
and how we, as the world's people, can help by becoming responsible stewards for the earth.
Welcome to Star Ridge
Retreat where the Inside Meets the Outside!
What We Need & What You Get
  We have been working with civil engineers
and an environmental scientist to create a special place where we can support nature,
clean up past damage, and restore habitat for fish and wildlife in order to be
able to come together in small groups and create a synergy that restores and
revitalizes not only us, but Mother Nature as well.  We’ve already invested tens of thousands of
dollars and countless hours to clean up the land, restore a more natural
habitat, and in planning and preliminary permitting, but our next step is to
install infrastructure. Partly because of the drought here in California, we
need an on-site water source and, in addition, plan to install a gray water
reclamation and catchment system that supports landscaping, wildlife habitat,
and contributes to water conservation. This system will be the first of its
kind in Sonoma County. Our hope is that this will not
be our last sustainable innovation—in other words, we hope to continue that
legacy of working with the county to see that even more sustainable practices
are adopted by the county and therefore approved for subsequent implementers down
the road.  
  This is Phase One of our endeavor. We need
your help to drill a well and get the basic infrastructure in place and to get
the gray water treatment and catchment system designed and approved by the
county.  Though we have preliminary
approval from the county to build such a system, they will still need to
approve the actual plans.  At this point,
it looks like the basic well drilling will cost about $15,000 without adding
plumbing and connections for later use which may cost another $12,000 to
install. The gray water system designs alone will cost about $10,000 with an
additional $13,000 paid to the county for the cost of the permits.  
  We also want to install our star-gazing
platform.  Near the top of our 25 acres,
we have a plateau perfectly suited for watching the sunset and sunrise, and for
star-gazing.  We have already started the
process of inviting a local astronomy group to come on a regular basis to guide
our Glampers through the heavens. Add another $10,000. 
  We also want to erect our first tent site.
Depending on the funds we receive, we’d like that first site to have a Yurt. But it
may end up being a wall tent. Either way, we will get first-hand experience on
what it takes to build the platform, erect the tent and install infrastructure. There's another $10,000.
We know that part of what drives this
crowd sourcing effort is the percs involved. 
Yet, every perc we offer takes a bit of our bottom line out from under

<p>This is a story about friendship, family and doing what we believe is right for the future generations, not just of Echo Park or LA or California, but of the Earth and all of its citizens  - both human and non-human. </p>
<p>Mollie Engelhart and I have been friends for over ten years and our first venture, Kindkreme, began when I had my daughter Bowie. It was about family, it was about women creating something and owning something together that could be passed on to the children - first Bowie and now Rio (Mollie’s son) too. Something that was a positive contribution to the kind of  world in which we want our children to grow up.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443041654/tqgg8tae1p1kq2hcfa7u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And as it expanded,  it became the place where we served hundreds of thousands of people the kind of food we believe in, many of whom have become friends, many of whom have become family.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A couple of years after opening Kindkreme, Mollie and I found ourselves wholly in charge and calling the shots of Sage Vegan Bistro, a real organic vegan restaurant located in my favorite neighborhood in Los Angeles, Echo Park. Being part of the burgeoning food landscape in this </span>neighborhood and <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">offering a few more options was an honor that we did not take lightly. </span><br/></p>
<p>Mollie's culinary pedigree goes far beyond icekreme and dessert making. As a vegan since birth who comes from a long line of resourceful cooks (ever heard of Cafe Gratitude??) she had already been feeding people delicious humane food  since long before we met. The time between her thinking of her next dish and then executing it consisted solely of her getting to a kitchen and getting the right ingredients. And like some sort of prodigy of flavor, she always got it right. On the first try. Even if it was some meat dish that she had never even tasted in her entire life. Perfect. First try.</p>
<p>And what we hadn’t learned yet about running a full restaurant kitchen, we were graciously taught over time by our kitchen manager and  Mollie’s future husband  Elias Sosa, who is also something of a prodigy himself - self-taught and whip smart, with a healthy dash of humor and irreverence to make it fun. </p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Nice Story (kinda long) why should you care?</h3>
<p>And best of all, the very best part about Sage Vegan Bistro in Echo Park was YOU. Our customers. It so corny that I’m embarrassed to say that it bring tears to my eyes when I think of our customers over the years, the regulars who have rotated in and out, the regulars who have stayed, the newbies, the lunch crowd, the people who always come when they are in town.   People who don’t know this neighborhood are always surprised when I tell them stories about you guys - the generosity, the forgiveness of mistakes, the graciousness. You, the people who live here and the people who come to eat here and the way you have welcomed us from the beginning, the way you keep coming back and the way you forgive all the little idiosyncrasies of the old building and our small kitchen and sometimes spotty service. </p>
<p>We are so grateful for you. <b>We f-ing love you.</b> And we want to create place where you don’t have to overlook those idiosyncrasies, where you don't have to wait 25 minutes to get a table for four or five and where you can <b>ORDER A BEER</b>! And a <b>VEGAN PRETZEL</b>!  And <b>PIZZA</b>! Where you can have a celebration with 15 people if you want or maybe just sit at the bar if you’re alone and people watch. We want to give more to the people who have given us so much over the years. </p>

<p>So what EXACTLY do we want to do???</p>
<p>Expand, my friends! We've been trying to do this for years in various ways and the perfect opportunity came up when the pawn shop next door decided to move to a different location. We will be doing as much work as possible in the space next door while Sage Vegan Echo Park stays open and then hopefully close for a very very short period and join the two spaces in a glorious moment that is the realization of everything we've ever wanted for this beautiful restaurant.

<p>Well, because this is gonna be expensive! And believe it or not, we’re actually only asking for less than a  THIRD of what we actually need from you guys and applying for loans for the rest. Some of the things we will be spending your hard earned money on are: </p>

<p>2) The architecture/design firm that will help us design the new place (we're expanding next door) and integrate it with our existing space and also facilitate and expedite all the permits we need from the city </p>

<p>4)  The contractors and electricians and plumbers and day laborers that will build everything out. </p>
<p>5) All of the new equipment needed from refrigeration to the brewpub equipment to glycol lines for the beer on tap … Yay! </p>
<p>What else?  A thousand other little things - this is our <b>4th time</b>  (whew!) either constructing a space from scratch or building out an existing space and its not cheap. Especially not in LA. And we've learned ALOT since 2009 -  our first 600 sq foot spot in Studio City that took us a year to figure out how to get open. </p>
<p>And especially, like I said, we appreciate your patience with all the funkiness of our space in the historic Jensen Recreation Center, but lately we’ve notice the restaurant has gotten ... a little too funky. Sage Echo Park is due for and deserves a little shine - so new, better tables and maybe chairs, and paint for everything and new outdoor tables and chairs, umbrellas that don't tip over, heat lamps… who knows? Upgrades!!!! Love!!</p>
<h3>What's In it For Youuuuu?</h3>
<div>Well, aside from all of the aforementioned coolness that an expanded Sage Echo park will offer: we've got some fun limited edition swag like stickers and beer koozies and tote bags, we've got t-shirts and hoodies, engraved growlers with a voucher for a free fill up of your favorite beer or kombucha .... and for you higher rollers, like $1000 and up, we've got discounts for LIFE ( the life of the business that is, which we hope is a very, very long time)</div>

<p><br/></p>
<p>and I have a dream. Like many. But it just so happens that I have 2 governmental organizations that believes and are interested in my project ( AMAAAZING ). They are both willing to finance me but I'm short on one little thing. "" Seed money"" indeed I do have most of what I need but still not enough. For me it's a big amount but to many it's only a couple of dollars.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So basically I'm just an ordinary girl living in Rosemont, Montreal who always had in interest in business and entrepreneur. A year ago,  all I was missing was "" the idea"".. but let's not get ahead.. <br/></p>
<p>Everything reeeally started almost 2 years ago. To be specific, on January 3    2014. On that very day, I had now found a new passion and that passion is called CROSSFIT. Indeed, on that day ..I didn't realize it... but this thing was gonna change my life ! For what it's worth ... this type of training is amazing.. Among other things, it's all about health, performances, mental fortitude, sense of accomplishment and making yourself better everyday. I truly never knew what I was made of until then.  BUT WHY ?? well .. in order to really focus on my performances I started to look on ways of eating so.. diets. Then, one day I stumbled across the PALEO diet.</p>
<p> Fair enough.. all good.. Used by many top athletes in crossfit OR to others more like a guideline....humm.... "" guideline"" very interesting... SO basically I had just then forevermore combined my long love for food and my new found ( couple of months into it ) love for CROSSFIT.

</div></div>","Hello my name is Julie

and I have a dream. Like many. But it just so happens that I have 2 governmental organizations that believes and are interested in my project ( AMAAAZING ). They are both willing to finance me but I'm short on one little thing. "" Seed money"" indeed I do have most of what I need but still not enough. For me it's a big amount but to many it's only a couple of dollars.

So basically I'm just an ordinary girl living in Rosemont, Montreal who always had in interest in business and entrepreneur. A year ago,  all I was missing was "" the idea"".. but let's not get ahead.. 
Everything reeeally started almost 2 years ago. To be specific, on January 3    2014. On that very day, I had now found a new passion and that passion is called CROSSFIT. Indeed, on that day ..I didn't realize it... but this thing was gonna change my life ! For what it's worth ... this type of training is amazing.. Among other things, it's all about health, performances, mental fortitude, sense of accomplishment and making yourself better everyday. I truly never knew what I was made of until then.  BUT WHY ?? well .. in order to really focus on my performances I started to look on ways of eating so.. diets. Then, one day I stumbled across the PALEO diet.
 Fair enough.. all good.. Used by many top athletes in crossfit OR to others more like a guideline....humm.... "" guideline"" very interesting... SO basically I had just then forevermore combined my long love for food and my new found ( couple of months into it ) love for CROSSFIT. ( Music from heaven ) :) Then on is was "" cake"" .. not literately .. (NO CAKE FOR ME ) and so on.. cooking.....pinterest recipes... food and health documentary.. this really is a passion.. can't stop learning and won't stop... Not to forget my best friend .. INSTAGRAM ...so yes.. meals pictures with #PALEOISH and #eattoperform, #foodismyreligion and #crossfitadd...yeah ... look me up on INSTAGRAM if you want ...j0ulie18 :)
Moving on..
Here I am.. a year or so later.. with a complete and functional business plan that caught the interest of many in the making and on an everyday basis is so close of making it happen !!
Because the ""paleo"" diet is not a super known way of eating. When the subject comes.. I have found myself to be a true advocate of the Paleo diet and not to forget crossfit.. yeah yeah.. Of course I need to talk about it !!.. it's my everyday reality and the very core of my business plan.. after all.. it all started in the gym.  #betteryourself :)
 Details... 
So.. Nowadays, with all that publicity with obesity crisis and unhealthy habits of the general population, I, want to make a difference by introducing this type of restaurant where anyone with a concern for what they eat will not be a problem and where healthy doesn't rime with vegetarian food ( no offense ). Indeed, for those who doesn't know ...the paleo diet is basically eating what is ""ready to eat"" or what they like to call...the ""cavemen diet"" ...so we are talking about meats, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds. Don't worry it doesn't have to be raw.. BUT it is better to eat raw veggies to keep most of the nutrients.. but you probably knew that already.. GOOD.
That type  of diet is also known to be one of the best to improve sports performances, lose extra weight and it's also known to help with inflammatory diseases like arthritis and asthma... and more. So to eat PALEO you eliminate refined sugars, grains, legumes, dairy and any process food.

<h3>Review - Breve Rese</h3> <p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Martín is a 6 years old Colombian boy, passionate about car racing and karting. He has been practicing this
discipline for a year and a half where his performance has been outstanding, proving a lot of passion and
dedication as he must travel long distances every month by car, in order to practice and race, since the nearest
track is in the city of Bogotá 400 Km away.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<div><div><div>
<p>Martín es un pequeño COLOMBIANO de 6 años de edad, apasionado del automovilismo y el kartismo. Lleva
un año y medio practicando esta disciplina donde se ha destacado, demostrando mucha pasión y entrega, ya
que tiene que viajar largas jornadas por mes vía terrestre para poder practicar y correr, pues la pista más
cercana está a 400 km, en Bogotá.
</p>
<p>Since he met karting, he became a very happy child. He discovered his passion. Nowadays he is racing the 3 existing karting
championships in Colombia: ROTAX MAX CHALLENGE, EASYTK and ROK CUP, in the BABY division.
Martín dreams about one day, racing in the FORMULA 1 championship. His biggest idols in car racing are:
Ayrton Senna, Juan Pablo Montoya and Fernando Alonso. He says: “I’ll be better than them when I grow up,
right daddy?”
</p>
<p>Desde que conoció el karting, se ha convertido en un niño mucho más feliz. Descubrió su pasión. Actualmente corre los 3 campeonatos
que existen en Colombia: ROTAX MAX CHALLENGE, EASYTK y ROK CUP, en la categoría BABY.
Martín sueña con correr algún día en la F1. Sus mayores ídolos en el automovilismo son: Ayrton Senna, Juan
Pablo Montoya y Fernando Alonso. Y dice: ""Cuando sea grande voy a ser mejor que ellos ¿Verdad papi?""
</p>
<p>With this campaign we want to get an economic boost to be able to cover the expenses of Martín’s sports
project, and be able to race in the EASYKART WORLD KARTING CHAMPIONSHIP to be held in Lignano
Sabbiadoro, ITALY.
</p>
<p>Con esta campaña queremos lograr un impulso económico para poder solventar el proyecto deportivo de
Martín y poder correr el MUNDIAL DE KARTISMO EASYKART que se celebrará en Lignano Sabbiadoro,
ITALIA.
</p>
<p>With your help, we will be able to take our son to the old continent and represent his country, Colombia.
Carrying the flag of Colombian Karting in his hands.
</p>
<p>Con tu ayuda, podremos lograr que nuestro pequeñín viaje al viejo continente y represente a su país,
Colombia. Llevando en sus manos las banderas del kartismo colombiano.

Martín is a 6 years old Colombian boy, passionate about car racing and karting. He has been practicing this
discipline for a year and a half where his performance has been outstanding, proving a lot of passion and
dedication as he must travel long distances every month by car, in order to practice and race, since the nearest
track is in the city of Bogotá 400 Km away.


Martín es un pequeño COLOMBIANO de 6 años de edad, apasionado del automovilismo y el kartismo. Lleva
un año y medio practicando esta disciplina donde se ha destacado, demostrando mucha pasión y entrega, ya
que tiene que viajar largas jornadas por mes vía terrestre para poder practicar y correr, pues la pista más
cercana está a 400 km, en Bogotá.

Since he met karting, he became a very happy child. He discovered his passion. Nowadays he is racing the 3 existing karting
championships in Colombia: ROTAX MAX CHALLENGE, EASYTK and ROK CUP, in the BABY division.
Martín dreams about one day, racing in the FORMULA 1 championship. His biggest idols in car racing are:
Ayrton Senna, Juan Pablo Montoya and Fernando Alonso. He says: “I’ll be better than them when I grow up,
right daddy?”

Desde que conoció el karting, se ha convertido en un niño mucho más feliz. Descubrió su pasión. Actualmente corre los 3 campeonatos
que existen en Colombia: ROTAX MAX CHALLENGE, EASYTK y ROK CUP, en la categoría BABY.
Martín sueña con correr algún día en la F1. Sus mayores ídolos en el automovilismo son: Ayrton Senna, Juan
Pablo Montoya y Fernando Alonso. Y dice: ""Cuando sea grande voy a ser mejor que ellos ¿Verdad papi?""

With this campaign we want to get an economic boost to be able to cover the expenses of Martín’s sports
project, and be able to race in the EASYKART WORLD KARTING CHAMPIONSHIP to be held in Lignano
Sabbiadoro, ITALY.

Con esta campaña queremos lograr un impulso económico para poder solventar el proyecto deportivo de
Martín y poder correr el MUNDIAL DE KARTISMO EASYKART que se celebrará en Lignano Sabbiadoro,

With your help, we will be able to take our son to the old continent and represent his country, Colombia.
Carrying the flag of Colombian Karting in his hands.

Colombia. Llevando en sus manos las banderas del kartismo colombiano.

within the industry, and I want to use the wisdom and education I gained over
the years to help other people reach their greatest potential. My music
blog will document my journey in pursuing my music dream, lessons
learned, and feature independent artists and their music. I am open to all
genres of music, since the music language is universal and multicultural. Artists that are
featured on the blog will be guests on the radio show. I will also utilize my
event planning skills to plan and promote any events the artists would like to
have locally, with the potential to grow globally. I want to help people by providing support, a listening ear, and advice to help them pursue their dreams. If I can help one person, then everything I have endured was not in vain. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I have received some criticism from some people because I have a daughter that is college bond (she is in the 11th grade), student loans, and I am the sole financial provider. I overcame abuse, rejection, severe depression, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and homelessness. I have lost everything and had to start over. I have become a stronger woman, mother, sister, daughter, educator, and friend. I am scared about moving to the next level in my destiny, but I don't have fear about the future anymore (there is a difference). When I allowed fear to take over, I was stuck and did not move at all. Once I moved past the fear, I became scared about the future. Even though I am scared, I am still pushing through adversities and issues to move to the next level. I do not know what the future holds, but I am definitely enjoying the journey. </p>

  The Impact
I am starting to make some solid connections
within the industry, and I want to use the wisdom and education I gained over
the years to help other people reach their greatest potential. My music
blog will document my journey in pursuing my music dream, lessons
learned, and feature independent artists and their music. I am open to all
genres of music, since the music language is universal and multicultural. Artists that are
featured on the blog will be guests on the radio show. I will also utilize my
event planning skills to plan and promote any events the artists would like to
have locally, with the potential to grow globally. I want to help people by providing support, a listening ear, and advice to help them pursue their dreams. If I can help one person, then everything I have endured was not in vain. 


Risks & Challenges I have received some criticism from some people because I have a daughter that is college bond (she is in the 11th grade), student loans, and I am the sole financial provider. I overcame abuse, rejection, severe depression, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and homelessness. I have lost everything and had to start over. I have become a stronger woman, mother, sister, daughter, educator, and friend. I am scared about moving to the next level in my destiny, but I don't have fear about the future anymore (there is a difference). When I allowed fear to take over, I was stuck and did not move at all. Once I moved past the fear, I became scared about the future. Even though I am scared, I am still pushing through adversities and issues to move to the next level. I do not know what the future holds, but I am definitely enjoying the journey.

<div><br/></div> <p>In January of 2010 after finding myself out of work in my field as a Horticulturist, I saw that I had to find another means of supporting myself and I'd had every kind of job one could do. From retail sales, food management, medical records and data entry and I hated going to them, every day. I looked at where I was in my life and living in my best friends garage with my things in storage after an unsuccessful move to San Francisco, I watched a PBS documentary on small business. </p>
<p>This woman's story was touching. She had been left with several children by her husband and found herself unemployed with no job experience or job history and no professed job skills. She was in crisis trying to keep the family home and support herself and her family and she was determined to do SOMETHING . She could bake. Everyone loved her cookies and told her she should open a business but she was skeptical. She gave it a whirl and at the end of the documentary she introduced herself  and said: ""My name is Mrs. Fields"" and stated if she could do what she had done anyone could. </p>
<p>I was captivated and motivated and I opened my small online business selling T-shirts. I don't know where the idea came from but after months of researching how to open a small business, resources, suppliers, how to build a website and where to go to get the paperwork needed and filed to do so I launched the online store. I then started attending local events, fairs, festivals and flea markets and I experienced enough success to support myself and my family. </p>
<p>Almost 6 years later I have found myself in the position with the opportunity to have a retail location, but my funds have run dry. I had no capital or cash flow to open the business. I began with an unemployment check and threw my profits back into the business taking big risks the whole way.  I have gone from my small beginning to where I am now on my work ethic and support of family, friends and the community and my determination to make it work. Now, I simply need help to cover expenses and the costs of growth into my retail shoes and I am so close.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The funds of 7500 will allow me to catch up with what I am behind and give me what I need to be able to open the retail store here and continue my dream. If I can manege, with your help, all additional funds will go toward buying a DTG (Direct to Garment ) printer which will be revolutionary to my business and allow me to truly compete in this  market. The initial cost of $10,000 - $20,000 will pay for itself the first year to maybe two years at most. I am offering certain ""perks"" small as they may be to contributors and also with each contribution I hope you will follow my journey and share, as I intend to share and help and encourage others in this arena. I believe everyone can and does make a difference and I hope to be able to offer classes at some point in screen printing for fun at home for anyone that is interested and to be a spokesperson for other artists and entrepreneurs. I hope to grow my small business resources site where I collect information, links and tools for small business ownees. I believe I can make it with your help and I am humbly asking you for your support. </p>

<div>With your support I will be able to keep the retail space I have come into and update my equipment to make a transition as this industry moves in time with the digital age and moves away from traditional screen printing. I can overcome this obstacle and with funding to grow and update my equipment I can compete in a larger market with Direct To Garment printing as screen printing is becoming a lost art and is expensive compared to DTG printing.. The equipment to make this transition is expensive outright but will pay for itself in short order as my costs will lower over 60%  per garment and it opens up the ability to do truly custom orders, even single ones  ON DEMAND, MADE TO ORDER! This is huge!!</div>

<p>As many of you know, our soap shop has been put on hold as Carissa focused on the costume business earlier this year.

<p>The reception we had to starting our business last year was phenomenal. We raised enough funds to not only buy more equipment and test out a bunch of recipes, but also to procure many of the basics needed to launch a successful shop. We hired a graphic designer to create a stunning logo for us, acquired business cards and signage for booths and market stalls, packaging, and even custom stamps with our logo.

<p>All funds raised through this campaign will be used to purchase the following: <br/>- Essential oils that will help us craft the perfect seasonal scents for both Fall and Winter, including some more exotic scents;<br/>- Base oils used in the production of soaps, such as organic coconut oil, sweet almond oil, grapeseed oil, castor oil and others;<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">- Natural butters such as cocoa butter and shea butter for their moisturizing properties;<br/>- Herbs, spices, produce, and other mix-in ingredients to accentuate texture or influence the scents of our products, such as pumpkin, apple, and flax. </span></p>

<h3>The Results</h3> <p>The more assistance we get with this fundraising campaign, the more variety we will be able to produce for this year's holiday season.

<p><b>WHO WE ARE</b></p>
<p>We are Laurie Winston and Rich Latronica, Atwater Village residents 
who love to ride our bikes to places with tasty food and drinks, fun and
 interesting people, and beautiful sights and sounds.  This is our labor
 of love, our commitment to our ideals and ideas, and our attempt at 
creating something new and amazing in this city we all call home, the 
city that has everything.  Except it doesn't have this.  </p>
<p><b>A little more about us</b></p>
<p>Laurie</p>
<p>laurie@spokebicyclecafe.com</p>
<p>I
 enjoy traveling, learning new skills, walking and biking around Los 
Angeles, and making/eating delicious food.  I come from a family of 
restaurant owners, caterers, and bakers, and have worked in the food 
service or hospitality industry for most of my life.  I specialize in 
vegetarian food and love menu planning.  This is my first restaurant 
venture on my own. My educational background is in Environmental Education as well 
as Environmental Policy and Planning and am currently pursuing a new 
interest in Psychology.  Sustainability and working with our local 
environment are important aspects in the development of this project for
 me.  I like gardening, my dogs, hiking, yoga, dancing, and listening to
 live music. I love exploring new places and believe you can't really 
get to know a place until you experience it on foot, by bike, or at a 
slower pace than an automobile.  I love meeting new people and am 
excited to have the opportunity to help create this awesome space for 
you all.  I prefer light roast Aeropress coffee and almond cappuccinos. 
 I'm a newly trained bicycle mechanic and teaching other women to become
 more self-sufficient with their bikes is a passion of mine.  I'm 
currently riding a flat bar commuter hybrid, an older model Specialized 
Sirrus Comp.</p>
<p><br/>Rich</p>
<p>rich@spokebicyclecafe.com</p>
<p>I
 am a coffee geek who loves new technology. My education is in Information Systems Technology.  I currently roast my own beans on a 
Hot Top and explore new and different roasting techniques all the time. 
 I plan on taking my roasting to a larger scale as Spoke progresses.  I 
am on a constant quest for innovation and efficiency and.  I love 
finding new products and methods of doing things and introducing them to
 people.  I'm an information junkie.  My drink of choice is the 
deceptively simple Americano.  I like playing, listening to, and 
producing music, taking photos, and brewing beer.  I plan to eventually 
serve my own beer at Spoke, which will be brewed onsite in an open 
location where people can really see how the process works. Sourcing 
local, well-made products and ingredients is very important to me.  I 
enjoy fixing things and solving complicated problems.  I spend a lot of 
time walking and biking in LA.  Inattentive drivers are my foes.  I'm 
currently rocking a Trek 7.2FX and am mainly a commuter.  <br/><br/><b>Our Mission:</b>
</p>
<p>We believe in quality work and quality products made by local people. 
 We strive to keep improving the community and involving locals in our 
plans. 
 We will build an inclusive place where people feel welcome and 
comfortable.  We are designing a beautiful space that 
enhances the natural environment. 

We will support and include other local businesses as much as 
possible.  We enjoy producing and serving creative, 
tasty beverages.  We source 
delicious food that tastes as good as it is good for you.  We love bicycling, encouraging people to travel by bicycle, and helping people learn about and improve their bikes.  We create new concepts, innovative ideas, 
and adapt to the changing world.  </p>
<h3>What is Spoke Bicycle Cafe? </h3>
<p>Located
 in Elysian Valley/Frogtown at the end of a dead end street in an 
industrial and residential area, we share a large border with the LA 
River bike and pedestrian path.  There are very few convenient services 
for the neighborhood and we would like to provide both neighborhood 
residents and path users with food and drinks. a gathering space, 
bicycle repair services and rentals, as well as music and art events.  <br/></p>
<p>We want to create a place that people are proud to have in their neighborhood and a place people are excited to come visit.  We want more people to discover the river.  There aren't very many places for the
people of LA to go so close to home where they can forget about the traffic,
the hustle and bustle, and chaos of everyday life. The river is one of these
places. We don't hear traffic here. We hear birds, see wildlife, see native
river plants. We don't have to hurry here. We want to help people experience
this valuable and life-enriching area. <br/></p>
<p>
We are
following the principles behind the adaptive reuse building philosophy, where
we are using what we have, but making it better. We are renovating existing
buildings, not tearing them down and putting in something that clashes with the
look and culture of the area. We have chosen to work with the industrial/nature
dichotomy of the site and will enhance the area, not detract from it. 
<br/></p>
<p>The bike shop is open now.  We repair bikes, sell accessories, and recently began renting bicycles as well.  We are improving the bike shop every week, so come in and see what we've added lately.  We have a shaded area with free water, restrooms, and great company for people to relax on hot days.  We currently sell a variety of healthy snacks and cold drinks, along with T shirts and an ever changing selection of our famous five dollar records.  We have live music on the weekends and have events like tie dye parties, art shows, and bicycle repair clinics.  We will continue all of this as we expand and  continue to promote non-motorized forms of transportation.  <br/></p></strong>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our first 
project is to build a full kitchen in order to offer freshly made breakfast items, sandwiches, salads, bowls and other tasty foods.  We will also be 
expanding our coffee offerings and introducing new, exciting beverage 
choices like smoothies, tonics, and juices.  We plan to serve healthy and delicious California-style food, craft beer
 and wine with an emphasis on local breweries and wineries. Phase two of our project will involve brewing our own beer.  Our emphasis will be on delicious food that makes people feel good and comes from as close by as we can get it.  There will be food options for all types of diets, including vegetarian, gluten free, paleo, and french fry lovers.  <strong><strong> </strong></strong><br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have the plans ready and all the sign offs from the city, but we need some help with the funds to actually build the kitchen.</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  We have come up with a lot of cool ways you can contribute and get some amazing perks!</span> </p>
<ul> <li>This first phase we are asking for $25,000.00 </li> <li>Check out the our unique offerings that include Coffee for a year, an invite to our big party, bike tune-ups for a lifetime, and opportunities to have your name  on our living wall or on one of the rental bikes. </li> <li>All funds are going directly to building of our full service kitchen.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
We
want to provide needed and desired services for the people who already live in
the neighborhood as well as the many city residents who use the path for
exercise, recreation, and rejuvenation. We have received a lot of positive
feedback from neighbors and local residents who want a place where they can
have a beer or a glass of wine along with a meal in their community; a place
with enough space to bring the kids, the family dog, their bicycles (without
having to worry about them getting stolen). We want to provide that space. We
get so many people who come in every day and say, ""what a great space, so
much potential."" We want to realize that potential and give the people what they want!
Your contribution will allow us to serve the bike and river community and offer a destination for the many LA River and Frogtown visitors. We strive to make the space better and involve the community by using the many artists and manufacturers from Frogtown to build and stock our restaurant.  <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will be creating a gathering space
and meeting place in an area that has no neighborhood center or street or much
of anything for people to do to get to know one another. We've already seen
this in action. People who live on the same street have met for the first time
at Spoke. We've seen this happen multiple times and the immediate results are
heartwarming, but the long-term results will be even better. This is how you
create healthy communities who really care about each other and the well being
of their neighbors, streets, sidewalks, and culture. When people have a place
to get to know each other, positive things happen. </p>
We have the opportunity to create something incredible and your support can really make a difference.  Thank you so much.  We can't wait to meet you all! <br/> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
</div></div>","Spoke Bicycle Cafe is a new destination on the LA River Bike 
Path in Frogtown/Elysian Valley in Los Angeles. We are in a state of 
transition right now, but our passions include bikes, coffee, delicious 
& healthy food and drinks, art, and music. We plan to bring all of 
this to our space on the river and we hope you will join us as our 
project evolves. 
We are trying to create something new
that will put LA on the map for being forward thinking, innovative and community-minded.

For over 4 years I have been traveling the U.S. sharing my healing gifts, teaching classes, volunteering my time to various love and service based organizations in order to assist people in remembering how to love themselves more.

<p>I am Ron Edwards, Owner and Baker of Heartsong’s
Caribbean Crunchies (my own recipe) I am a Service-Disabled Veteran (USMC) and also a
successful business owner of Focus Advertising Specialties, having just entered
our 11 year!<span>  <strong>It has always been my desire
to provide an inviting environment where I can introduce people to deliciously
healthy foods.</strong> </span></p><p><span>Being diagnosed and living with Multiple Sclerosis, and having recovered
from a Traumatic Brain Injury, taught me <strong>how incredibly important food is in
the healing process and for sustaining health.</strong> 
I got really serious about eating organic foods and it has made a life affirming difference in my
recovery.  That is why I am so passionate about introducing this to my community
and beyond, as a way of life, health and joy.</span></p>
<p><strong>We need to
raise $15,000 to upgrade to a commercial kitchen in our newly rented retail space in the heart of Crested Butte,
CO so we can open Heartsong's Caribbean Bakery and Café.</strong><span>  For the past 11 months we have
been renting commercial kitchens and have had limited time and/or space to bake
in.  Having our own commercial kitchen and retail bakery/cafe in 1 location, so we can bake and sell my Organic Crunchies and healthy food, is incredibly important to us moving
forward. This opportunity, combined with overwhelming
community support and excitement is astounding!! </span></p>
<p>My initial foray into this market began at
the Crested Butte Farmers Market in Colorado last year.  From the
beginning I sold out within 2 hours every Sunday and had to triple the amount I
produced to meet the weekly demand over the 19 weeks of the Farmers Market (June
through October).  </p>
<p>Retail
locations up and down the Gunnison Valley carry my Crunchies and
most notably, the Crested Butte Community School (K through 12) Cafeteria
routinely purchases about $400.00 worth every month!!   <strong>The children (and parents) love
the 2 oz. Crunchie Energy Bars!!</strong>  </p>
<p>With Flexible Funding - we get to keep
whatever is raised!! This will help us immensely to <strong>purchase the equipment
we need to upgrade our space to a commercial kitchen</strong>, such as; a Bakers
Pride commercial Convection oven, 2 door display refrigerator, a display
counter, a commercial freezer, Hobart mixer, hand sink and prep sink (and plumbing
installation) stainless steel work tables &amp; shelves, and create a “Colorful
Caribbean Environment”.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430680925/o5cv0tctvpzfyhz4g7ud.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 144.79px; height: 183px;""/>                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430682026/cssxxsdyqxyckkxvlavl.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 133.5px; height: 199px;""/>                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430688549/jb4v9xgdhwnhir7ve8r5.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 189px; height: 189px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430684743/dob2ghvgutrbsltzrpcu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>By cooperatively and holistically walking alongside trauma survived youth, we strive to offer comprehensive opportunity of personal mastery that may lead to the discovery of human potential and actualization. With commitment to lifelong wellness, we collaborate with community based supports, honoring the strength, suffering, and resilience of each individual culturally, spiritually, emotionally, mentally, and physically; providing mentor-supported collective care beyond the safety of the six month trauma recovery stay.</p>
<p>We offer eclectic opportunity for healing and growth within the four directions of the participant, enabling them to identify and build upon areas of strength.

<p>We are looking for donations, or individuals to buy into the cooperative, to make this a reality. As a co-operative member, you would have the opportunity to participate as a board member, planning committees, interested community member, and voting rights on upcoming decisions. </p>

The growing rates of involvement into gang culture and lateral violence  reflects the increasing need for intensive, safe, flexible and sustainable helping resources for this particular vulnerable population. </p>
<p>FDCCTR offers a safe and comfortable environment to begin trauma based healing, using sustainable means within one's body, mind, emotions, and spirit. With a team of supports surrounding the individual within and beyond the centre, participants may have opportunity to best utilize an extension of care by adopting sustainable healing and coping techniques, discover untapped skills and develop unique human capacity. </p>
<p>We have the ability to change the course of an individuals life, to better our communities, and provide opportunities not otherwise provided.

<p>In today's fast-paced world, we are all surrounded by
negativity and stress. We spend our days rushing from appointment to
appointment, never stopping completely long enough to fully enjoy the world
that is outside our bubble. It seems that most of our issues stem from
negativity thoughts, feelings and experiences, and they are the roots of all
our troubles. While negative thoughts tend to lead to negative actions,
positivity begets positivity, and there simply cannot be enough positive
thought or action in the world. Along this philosophy, we created 'Occasional
Muse' as an Instagram account with the <b>aim of spreading positivity</b> via a series
of daily inspirational quotes.</p>

Crowdfunding is an amazing way to include all our supporters and 
like-minded individuals to our cause. Not only do we want our community 
to feel being part of this process, we invite you to give us feedback 
and ideas and help us perfect our concept. A business requires a 
significant amount of start-up capital, so we definitely need all the 
financial help we can get as well. Also, the more people get behind the 
project, the easier it’ll be for us to put together a self-sufficient 
business and start our humanitarian projects sooner. We want to do this 
together with all of YOU, our amazing and loving supporters who identify
 with us and share our vision!<br/><br/>However, if you can't donate at 
this time, there are still many ways to help us fund our project! Please

very best to answer them all as soon as possible, so we hope for your 
patience and understanding. <strong></strong>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p>We’ll try our best to answer all enquiries within 24 hours.
<br/><br/></p>
<strong><p><strong>I HAVE PURCHASED A T-SHIRT REWARD. HOW CAN I TELL YOU WHICH SIZE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE?</strong><br/><br/></p></strong><p>We'll contact everyone after the campaign and ask which size(s) and 
colour(s) you would like to receive. Our size chart will also be emailed
 to everyone.

<strong><strong><p><br/><strong>IF THE PROJECT DOESN'T REACH IT'S FUNDING GOAL, DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?</strong></p></strong></strong>No, because we are doing a so-called Flexible Campaign, which means 
that even if we don’t reach our goal, we'll still receive all the funds 
raised. All the money is going towards making Occasional Muse a reality 
and production of the perks. Every dollar helps the cause we are doing

very best to answer them all as soon as possible, so we hope for your 
patience and understanding. 

We’ll try our best to answer all enquiries within 24 hours.

I HAVE PURCHASED A T-SHIRT REWARD. HOW CAN I TELL YOU WHICH SIZE I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE?We'll contact everyone after the campaign and ask which size(s) and 
colour(s) you would like to receive. Our size chart will also be emailed
 to everyone.


I'D LIKE TO SEND THE PERKS TO MY FAMILY & FRIENDS! CAN THE PERKS BE SHIPPED TO AN ADDRESS THAT ISN'T OUR BILLING ADDRESS?No problem! We'll send your perks wherever you'll want them to be 
shipped when they're ready to go. It doesn’t have to be the same 
address. 
IF THE PROJECT DOESN'T REACH IT'S FUNDING GOAL, DO I GET MY MONEY BACK?No, because we are doing a so-called Flexible Campaign, which means 
that even if we don’t reach our goal, we'll still receive all the funds 
raised. All the money is going towards making Occasional Muse a reality 
and production of the perks. Every dollar helps the cause we are doing 
this for.

Consumer-oriented brain-computer interface technology (cBCI) holds great personal, commercial, and medical potential. We've already seen inspiring applications of the technology.


However, the present and near-future proliferation of cBCI in the absence of 1) common safety and privacy standards, 2) consumer understanding of the capabilities of the technology, and 3) public awareness of its potential downstream consequences constitutes a set of concerns that must be proactively addressed.


CeReB is being formed as a excellence and thought leadership for the exploration and development of ethical standards and best practices in cBCI. CeReB will foster and support research and dialogue on these issues with the goal of developing clear, meaningful, and achievable standards for ensuring the efficacy of brainwave technology and the agency, privacy, and safety of its users. CeReB will also act as a source for reliable information concerning cBCI and encourage the development of cBCI in a manner that defends consumer rights.
Board members include Brian Behlendorf from Electronic Frontier Foundation, Anne Cavoukian former Privacy Commissioner of Ontario and pioneer of Privacy by Design, Ariel Garten CEO of InteraXon, Luca Pisterzi privacy and data analytics at Ontario Brain Institute, Dirk Rodenburg Semaphore Institute, and Nita Farahany who was appointed to Obama's commission for bioethics. CeReB is a not for profit, and in order to exist and remain an open and transparent body for all, requires your help.

<p><b>The Inspiration</b></p>
<p>“Running on Hope” is my response to people asking, “how can God exist if
there are so many starving kids in the third-world?” I read in the Bible that
people are not born in the conditions they have due to something they have done
but so the works of God could be displayed (John 9). There are so many
different reasons for why someone or even full nations are suffering, but it is
our duty to try and make a difference. With this project, we may not have the
power to change the world but we have a great opportunity to make an
everlasting impact on the lives of starving men, women, and children in Burkina
Faso. </p>
<p><b>Short
Summary</b></p>
<p>Last June, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/running-on-hope/edit/www.teebo.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Teebo</a> launched
a pilot agricultural program to end Burkina Faso's annual Starving Season in
one village, Goumsin. Farmers who were part of the program harvested more
than seven times the normal amount of crops. And they doubled their yields
which is equal to 8-10 months of food for a family of five. This effort truly
has ended the starving season for the hard working farmers in our program for
the first year. The organization wants to continue to empower a second group of
farmers in Goumsin and for the first time in the village of Goennega with
fertilizer, simple plows, and to help them farm more land with oxen. This
program is built with sustainability in mind. Farmers who participate once will
pay part of their profits to participate again. In this way, Teebo can fund
program growth and reach more villages. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We are looking to
raise $10,000 in two consecutive fundraisers of $5,000 to provide 55 plows and
60 bags of fertilizers to the farmers. For every dollar raised, Joey and the
other members will run one meter ($1 = 1meter).</p>
<p> 100% of all
donations will go to the program and is tax-deductible.</p>
<p>Campaign rewards are
beautiful traditional hands made gifts by the people of Burkina Faso, a jersey
with Teebo's logo and a running on hope t-shirt.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Burkina Faso is a landlocked country in West Africa with
more than 18 million people. 80% of the population lives by subsistence farming
with 90% involved in farming. Farmers work very hard to plant peanuts, beans,
corn, and millet, but drought and poor soil make good harvests almost
impossible. After a successful pilot program last year with the people of
Goumsin, Teebo has seen the impacts. With their animal-drawn plows,
farmers can now work 2.5 acres of land in two days vs. four weeks. Furrows
dug by animal plows are also deeper, providing greater stability for the
plants.</p>
<p>Your
support to #EndStarvingSeason in Goumsin and Goennega will bless the community
as whole and the country of Burkina Faso at long run. Why? By equipping farmers
and empowering them, we lead them to fight against starving season and gain
more food during harvest. In addition, part of the harvest profit can be sold
to cover their kids’ school tuition, provide emergency needs to the family and
cover basic needs.</p>

En 2001, empezamos nuestra <b>ONG, Fundación Casa Victoria,</b> inscrita bajo el
Ministerio de Bienestar Social del Ecuador, en Nov. 21, 2001, Acuerdo

En 2001 , un grupo entusiasta de amigos y yo decidimos comprar esta antigua casa, con la idea de ponerla al servicio de la comunidad en algún momento. Después de 5 años de cuidadosa restauración, <b>desde 2007,</b> ha sido un lugar de cuidado, de amor y servicio a los niños de familias de bajos 

ingresos de esta área.<br/>

<p>Uno de los servicios que ofrecemos
en esta hermosa casa es <b>un programa único de Apoyo Escolar después de la escuela
para los niños del barrio. </b>Muchos padres de familia de bajos recursos economicos, procedentes en su mayoría de zonas rurales de Ecuador, ponen
largas horas como vendedores de verduras y frutas en el mercado local de San Roque.  <b>Sin Casa Victoria</b> , sus hijos no tendrían dónde ir después de la escuela y se verían obligados a pasar su tiempo en la
calle, <b>expuestos al robo, la prostitución y consumo de droga.</b></p>

</p>
Durante los últimos 8 años , hemos <b>servido a más de 400 niños,</b> gracias a las <b>aportaciones mensuales de generosos patrocinadores</b> que han creído en nosotros en Casa Victoria.

</p>
Sin embargo, consideramos que es hora que nosotros seamos más auto sustentables y depender menos de las contribuciones externas. Para llegar a una solución financiera que mantendría Casa Victoria en ejecución, decidimos empezar un pequeño negocio que genere un ingreso estable.

A PIZZA-CAFÉ for CASA VICTORIA
 
Hello!  My name is Alicia Duran-Ballen, dreamer and founder of a place of love and beauty for children at risk in Old Town Quito, Ecuador.
 A place we call


Part of the dream was to create a Pizza-Café for Casa Victoria so that the income generated from this small business could help us continue to provide a safe, loving and fun environment at Casa Victoria for these children of low income families. Here they are able to truly enjoy their childhood years instead of roaming the streets aimlessly.
But this is how it all started...

A long time ago, I fell in love with a dilapidated historic mansion, located in a ""bad"" section of Old Town Quito, Ecuador.


In 2001, an enthusiastic group of friends and I started our Non Profit Organization, Fundación Casa Victoria, registered under the Ministry of Social Welfare of Ecuador, on Nov. 21, 2001,  by Decree # 2288.  We bought this grand old
house, and spent five years lovingly restoring it to make it available to the
community.


In 2007, we opened Casa Victoria as a place of care, love and service for children of low-income families.One of the services we provide in this
beautiful house is a daily unique after-school program for these neighborhood
children  whose parents are mostly produce vendors
in the local market.  Many of them are
unschooled and poor, coming from rural areas of Ecuador.  Living in rented two-room spaces, they
usually do not have extended families with them in the city.  Without Casa Victoria, their children
would have nowhere to go after school and would be forced to spend their
time on the street, exposed
to thieving, prostitution, and drug use.






Our Casa Victoria team: Dana W., (back row);Alex, and his wife, Eve; Irene O. 

Every afternoon, we offer an alternative: we welcome 60 children to our Casa to help them with homework, to read with them in our little library, to teach them Biblical Principles, computer skills, arts and crafts, and to play soccer. We also provide them with a hot, home-cooked meal. 
For the last 8 years, we have
served over 400 children, thanks to monthly contributions from generous
sponsors who have believed in us at Casa Victoria. 
We feel, however, it´s time for us to be more self-sustainable,  to rely less on outside contributions, and to come up with a financial solution which would keep Casa Victoria running.  We decided to start a small business that will generate some steady income.
We are excited to share with you the opportunity to join us in our campaign to start                                                      Pizza-Café
Casa Victoria! 
Since we already have the perfect space in our Casa for it, there is no need to search for one to rent.  







Our marvelous cellar of
Casa Victoria, which,
with your help, we will turn into a lovely Pizza-Café

Thanks to a generous initial contribution some months ago, we bought a pizza oven and have been making tasty pizzas for delivery. They have been received very well by the community and are already in high demand.



                      Casa Victoria´s  volunteers  preparing PIZZAS TO GO!




We have been
successful because our ingredients are home-made: our own
Italian-style thin crust; our tomato and herbs sauce with our home-grown oregano,
thyme, and basil--which our Casa Victoria children are learning to plant and tend  in our little vegetable garden. 

Before planting...


Planting....

Tending....
""Danielito"" G. helping out the children in the vegetable garden
Also, we buy the freshest, ripest,  juiciest tomatoes, zucchini, onions, garlic, and mushrooms from some of the parents of the children of Casa Victoria who work as vendors at Mercado San
Roque, the produce and fruit market only three blocks  away from
us! 






Jorge and Mamalicia buying fresh, ripe tomatoes  




 Choosing aromatic spices and herbs at San Roque Market




But
we want more than just Pizza Delivery!  We want a full-fledged
Pizza-Café. Why? Because 1) we want a place where we will give
our adolescent alumni a job opportunity where they can learn valuable
skills by teaching them hands-on excellence in customer
service, food preparation, and managing a small business; and 2) generate income to  keep Casa Victoria running.





With
your tax deductible contribution we will be able to turn the cellar of Casa Victoria into a
beautiful Pizza-Café without altering its historical identity and charm, while, at the
same time, giving it all the modern conveniences such as WIFI, large tables for
students to gather, a modern washroom, and a functional commercial kitchen
area.

                 Please join us in creating our Pizza-Café Casa Victoria!  

Remember that the income generated from this small business will help Casa Victoria to continue  its free service to the children of this underserved area.

Creative Interiors--Isabel María  Diez, Interior Designer


A lovely young designer and mother of two toddlers who has a passion for making places beautiful ""My role in this project is to do and oversee the entire interior design proposal of  Pizza-Café Casa Victoria.  I fell in love with this project not only for the challenge to transform their unique cellar  into a space that invites patrons to enjoy themselves here and return often, but also because the


funds generated, will allow
Casa Victoria to continue providing a safe-haven for     at-risk
children--which I have seen them do with such love and dedication.”

 Lauseker Coffee
Experts----Pablo and Erick Velasco



A father and son team who have quickly become well-versed in the coffee advising sector 
  





          ""We will provide Casa Victoria´s  Pizza-Café  with our high quality coffee, our fine coffee maker machine and professional grinder, plus give a workshop to Baristas so they will be equipped to prepare and serve coffee with excellence and care. Additionally, we will conduct regular quality control visits to  make sure it is consistent and tasty as the first cup.  We know this will be a first-rate coffee shop 
plus with an admirable purpose!""



********************







The Impact 
Our Pizza/Café project will greatly impact the neighborhood where we serve, not only because we will have a quality Café with excellent service and food, but because we will be the first in Plaza Victoria to provide such a service.  Neighbors will follow and also improve their own little shops and businesses along the Plaza when they see that tourists and nearby college students will be our daily clients.  


We will offer free WIFI, a modern restroom, excellent service, and never-before-heard-of- in this part of town:  satisfaction guaranteed in all our products to all our clients. 
                                                    ************************
OUR TRACK RECORD IN TRUST AND CREDIBILITY...

Because of Casa Victoria´s hard-earned trust during the past 14 years, we were awarded grants from CRISFE, FONSAL, INNOVAR. These are prestigious Ecuadorian institutions who backed us up financially because of their belief  in our integrity and the good works we do for the children at Casa Victoria:

2003-2004- 
Funds for Rebuilding the whole roof and several wooden floors.
2006--2007-INNOVAR--    
Funds
for Library and Computer Stations equipping, plus training our librarian.
2011-- 2013 FUNDACION CRISFE     
Funds for fixing the wooden floors of two stations; funds for the children´s meals  for two years; coordinators salaries during the 2-year support.    
2008-2012-   
FUNDACION ECUADOR MI PAIS
Funds for 20 scholarships per year, during 4 years.


**********

This year,  we´ve had an added blessing during all of 2015;  a person from a very well known supermarket, gives us a monthly quota to buy groceries to prepare daily meals for the children. 
Many individuals have also contributed personally for several renovation works and equipping we have done throughout the years. 
Because there are no organizations in Ecuador that provide grants to start a small business to support an NGO such as Casa Victoria, we have turned to crowdfunding Indiegogo as the perfect means to raise the funds we need to make this small business  a success!   




                                Please
join us in making this happen!  
                                            ***********************


Risks & Challenges






·  The
main challenge is that, although our beautiful house sits right on Plaza
Victoria, it is located in a poor section of Old Town Quito which is not
yet a tourist spot. 


·  Our
street and plaza are budgeted by City Hall to be part of the urban regeneration
plan for 2016, we hope this is a reality so it becomes a destination
worth visiting.


· 
If we don´t meet our 28K goal, we would still use whatever
amount to start restoring enough to make it functional. We would purchase part
of the furniture, pay all the legal fees for operation, and serve pizzas only.
 Maybe wait a bit for the coffee machine, etc. and the ""coffee
side"" of the Café...


    But, we have faith that the good Lord will provide what is needed through wonderful friends and friends of friends...and even, strangers!  Gracias to all!!

ESPAÑOL 


             PIZZERÍA-CAFÉ PARA 
                CASA VICTORIA


Hola! Me llamo Alicia Duran-Ballen, soñadora y fundadora de un lugar de belleza y amor para los niños y niñas en riesgo en el Centro Histórico de Quito, Ecuador.                                                    Un lugar que llamamos


 Parte del sueño es la creación de Pizzería-Café Casa Victoria cuyos ingresos generados por esta pequeña empresa, ayuden a continuar ofreciendo un sitio seguro, de cuidado y cariño que es Casa Victoria para estos niños que proceden de familias de escasos recursos.                      
Pero, permítanme contarles cómo comenzó todo...


Hace muchos años, me enamoré de una mansión histórica totalmente 
deteriorada, situada en un sector ""malo"" del Centro Histórico de Quito, Ecuador. 


En 2001, empezamos nuestra ONG, Fundación Casa Victoria, inscrita bajo el
Ministerio de Bienestar Social del Ecuador, en Nov. 21, 2001, Acuerdo
Ministerial    # 2288.


En 2001 , un grupo entusiasta de amigos y yo decidimos comprar esta antigua casa, con la idea de ponerla al servicio de la comunidad en algún momento. Después de 5 años de cuidadosa restauración, desde 2007, ha sido un lugar de cuidado, de amor y servicio a los niños de familias de bajos 

ingresos de esta área.



Uno de los servicios que ofrecemos
en esta hermosa casa es un programa único de Apoyo Escolar después de la escuela
para los niños del barrio. Muchos padres de familia de bajos recursos economicos, procedentes en su mayoría de zonas rurales de Ecuador, ponen
largas horas como vendedores de verduras y frutas en el mercado local de San Roque.  Sin Casa Victoria , sus hijos no tendrían dónde ir después de la escuela y se verían obligados a pasar su tiempo en la
calle, expuestos al robo, la prostitución y consumo de droga.

Nuestro equipo de Casa Victoria: Dana W (fila de atrás) ;  Alex, y su esposa, Eve; Irene O. Todas las tardes , ofrecemos una alternativa : damos la bienvenida a 60 niños para ayudarlos con las tareas, leer en nuestra pequeña biblioteca, aprender valores y principios Bíblicos, conocimientos de informática, manualidades, juego de fútbol, y disfrutar de una comida caliente hecha en casa.

Durante los últimos 8 años , hemos servido a más de 400 niños, gracias a las aportaciones mensuales de generosos patrocinadores que han creído en nosotros en Casa Victoria. 


Sin embargo, consideramos que es hora que nosotros seamos más auto sustentables y depender menos de las contribuciones externas. Para llegar a una solución financiera que mantendría Casa Victoria en ejecución, decidimos empezar un pequeño negocio que genere un ingreso estable.



Estamos muy contentos de compartir con ustedes la oportunidad de unirse a  nuestra campaña para comenzar Pizzería-Café Casa Victoria!


Como ya tenemos el espacio perfecto para esta Pizzería/Café no necesitamos salir en busca de uno para arrendar! 



Tenemos el maravilloso sótano de Casa Victoria que, con su gentil apoyo, vamos a convertir en una encantadora Pizzería-Café! 


Gracias a la colaboración de un donante hace unos meses, se pagó la mitad del costo de los equipos de pizza, y hemos podido hacer pizzas sabrosas para entrega y así, empezar a hacernos conocer en la comunidad.  Hemos tenido muy buena acogida y han habido muchos 
pedidos!


Voluntarios preparando PIZZAS PARA LLEVAR! 



Hemos tenido éxito porque nuestros ingredientes
son de elaboración casera : nuestra propia masa delgada estilo italiano ,
nuestra salsa de tomate y hierbas tales como orégano, tomillo y albahaca,
cosechados en nuestro propio huerto que nuestros niños y niñas de Casa
Victoria aprenden a plantar y cuidar.

Pero queremos más que ""Pizzas para Entregar"" ! Queremos una Pizzería-Café de verdad. ¿Por qué? 1) Porque queremos un lugar donde daremos a nuestros  ex alumnos, ahora adolescentes, la oportunidad de un trabajo donde puedan aprender valiosas habilidades, enseñándoles excelencia en el servicio al cliente, preparación de alimentos, gerencia de una pequeña empresa; todo esto,  con alta ética de trabajo y de integridad; 2) generar ingresos estables para mantener Casa Victoria.


Con tu apoyo podremos convertir el sótano de Casa Victoria en una hermosa Pizzería-Café sin alterar la identidad histórica de la casona,  y al mismo tiempo, ofreciendo todas las comodidades modernas, como Wi-Fi, mesas grandes para grupos de estudiantes; un baño decente y cómodo; una área de cocina moderna y funcional.

""Mi papel en este proyecto es de hacer y supervisar toda la propuesta de diseño de interiores de Pizzería/Café Casa Victoria . Me enamoré de este proyecto, no sólo por el reto de transformar su sótano en un espacio que invite a los clientes  a que se diviertan aquí y vuelvan a menudo, sino también porque los fondos generados, permitirán a Casa Victoria continuar proporcionando un refugio seguro para los niños en riesgo-- que he visto que ellos lo hacen con tanto amor y dedicación "".

""Proporcionaremos a Pizzería/Café Casa Victoria nuestro café de alta calidad, nuestra máquina de café fino y molinillo profesional, además de dar un taller para Baristas por lo que estarán entrenados para preparar y servir café con la excelencia y la atención necesarias. Además, llevaremos a cabo visitas periódicas de control de calidad para asegurar se mantenga igual de sabroso como la primera taza.  Sabemos que esto será un Café de primera calidad, además con un propósito admirable! ""



                                   ******************************
 Impacto en la Comunidad 


Nuestro proyecto de Pizzería-Café será de gran impacto en el barrio donde estamos, no sólo porque vamos a tener un Café de calidad con excelente servicio y comida, sino porque será el primero en la Plaza Victoria en proporcionar un servicio de este tipo. Los vecinos seguirán el ejemplo y también mejorarán sus propias pequeñas tiendas y negocios al rededor de la Plaza cuando vean que los turistas y estudiantes universitarios serán nuestros clientes diarios. Vamos a ofrecer WIFI gratuito , un baño moderno, excelente servicio, y algo nunca antes escuchado en esta parte de la ciudad : Satisfacción garantizada en todos nuestros productos a todos nuestros clientes!


NUESTRA TRAYECTORIA EN CONFIANZA Y CREDIBILIDAD...  
Debido a la confianza duramente ganada durante los últimos 14 años, Casa de
Victoria ha alcanzado, se nos otorgó apoyo económico en tres ocasiones por CRISFE, FONSAL, INNOVAR, instituciones ecuatorianas de prestigio que nos han respaldado financieramente:

2003-2004- 
Fondos para restauración total de  la cubierta de la Casa: reparación de algunos pisos de madera.                                                                                
   2006--2007-INNOVAR--  
Fondos para la Biblioteca y Computación; entrenamiento de bibliotecaria.        

2008-2012-  FUNDACION ECUADOR MI PAIS--
Fondos para 20 becas por año.
2011--2013- FUNDACION CRISFE     
Fondos para reparar varios pisos de madera adicionales; fondos para elaboración de comida  para los niños/as durante dos años; salarios de coordinadores durante los dos años de apoyo.       

Este año, hemos tenido una bendición adicional durante todo el 2015: una persona de un supermercado muy conocido, nos da una cuota
mensual para comprar alimentos para preparar comidas diarias para los niños. 
Muchas personas también han contribuido individualmente durante varios trabajos
de renovación y equipamiento que hemos realizado a lo largo de los años.


Porque no hay organizaciones en Ecuador que ofrecen subvenciones para iniciar un pequeño negocio para apoyar a una ONG como Casa Victoria, hemos recurrido a crowdfunding Indiegogo como el medio perfecto para recaudar los fondos que necesitamos para hacer que este pequeño negocio sea un éxito. 
                                   Todos juntos, podremos lograrlo!

 Riesgos & Desafíos




El principal desafío es que, a pesar de que nuestra hermosa casa se encuentra justo en la Plaza Victoria, se encuentra en un barrio pobre de la ciudad vieja de Quito , que aún no es un lugar turístico. 


 Nuestra calle y la plaza están dentro del presupuesto del Municipio de Quito para ser parte del plan de regeneración urbana para 2016, por lo que esperamos que el área mejore pronto y sea un destino digno de visitar. 


Si no  alcanzamos nuestra meta de $28,000 ,  utilizaríamos la cantidad recaudada para iniciar la restauración suficiente para que sea funcional. Compraríamos parte de los muebles, pagaríamos todos los honorarios legales para la operación, y sólo sirviríamos pizzas. Esperaríamos tal vez un poco para  la compra de la máquina de café , etc., y lo relacionado con el ""lado de café "" de la Cafetería.  



Pero tenemos fe en que nuestro buen Dios proveerá lo necesario a través de maravillosos amigos, y amigos de amigos ...e incluso, desconocidos!  
                                                  Gracias a todos !!
