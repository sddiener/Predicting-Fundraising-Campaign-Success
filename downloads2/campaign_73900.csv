<h3>What is behind ÜBER und Walz?</h3>
<p>I am an 18 years old boy of Chile. Everyday in went to different shopping centers in Santiago, I saw stores that sold products that we consume a lot in Chile, but, premium. Chocolates, Tee, Wines, everything that we eat in a massive way were sold in an exclusive way, made for people who were looking for that special taste that supermarket products can not give them. But, something was missing. One of the favorite <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">liqueurs of chilean people, the beer. That is how we decided to create ÜBER und WALZ-Premium Beerhouse, a place where beer-lovers can find the perfect beer for them. In this store we will sell uncommon but Premium beers and other products from all over the world that will turn your experience while drinking a beer into something </span><font>unforgettable.</font></p>

<p><font>ÜBER und WALZ is the response to a selected group of people in Chile that looks for Premium Beers and a Premium service. We plan to have an ""everything for the client"" system, where we will do whatever it takes to satisfy you in our store. To reach that goal we want to have different services, like a rewards system, home deliveries, special offers for frequent customers, supplies for special events or restaurants, among others.</font></p>
<p><font>All the information, products, services and contact would be in our website, that will also allow online payments.</font></p>
<p><font>If you help us, apart from the reward you will receive as soon as the store opens, you could be funding a future stores chain, but never forget, our main purpose is to make the client leave our store happy and that he wants to, so we need you to complete that objective.</font></p>

<h3>What we need and what you get!</h3>
<p>We need you. To open a store of this size in a zone where we can find people that can afford these beers, is not easy. We estimate that the total cost to open this store will be USD 60000. But we want you to trust us, so here we present you were are these 60000 thousand going:</p>
<p>1) We can´t work in a garage. To build this store in order to make it look as a first class shop, we will need approximately USD 35000.</p>
<p>2) A beer store needs beers. The total stock for our store will cost us 10 thousand dollars. </p>
<p>3) Who is going to work? To hire, train and pay 4 employees monthly, we will need USD 5000.</p>
<p>4) Other expenses, like traveling to make deals with beer companies, paying a rent every month, buying uniforms for the employees, paper work and others, will cost 10 thousand more.</p>

<p>Of course, we won´t forget you if you support our dream. There are many fantastic rewards that we are able to offer you, from a simple ThankYou! Card to a ForeverMember Card that will give you 60% discount on your shops in the store or in internet, forever. In case that is to much beer for you we can give you an other option, like beers and other products that you will receive a soon as the store opens. What we are trying to say, is that we want you to be part of this project and not only someone who is giving money, because you are more than that for us.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is always a chance we do not reach our goal. In case the money we collect is too far from the USD 60000, you will get your money back!. Guaranteed.</p>
</div><div> <h3>Is this worth it?</h3>
<p>Why is this project important for you? Fantastic question. The first impression you could receive is that this is a risky bet, because I am just an 18 years old boy from Chile, and you are right. I am a risky bet, but if this risky bet succeed, you could have helped me to start a store, that in the future could be worldwide, and you could have helped to reproduce that experience that we want to have in Chile, in the whole world. The best projects have started from someone unknown, do not forget Facebook. And every great project once started with someone that had a dream and someone who supported it.</p>
<p>And if you think deeply, this bet is not so risky. I am a very organized person that has been the leader of many projects, such as the import of about 150 Chinese products which included chargers, earphones and cases in Chile. I sold them all.</p>

<p>I also have been the President of the class twice, so I know how to administrate something important and specially when there is money involved.</p>
<p>But the most important for me is, that the say you receive your reward for supporting us, you can feel that somewhere in Chile, a dream came true and that you where part of it.</p>
</div><div> <h3>Risks and challenges.</h3>
<p>Is everything in this project perfect? Of course not, it is impossible. </p>
<p>Perhaps we are wrong, and we do not receive as much public as we thought. But we know that with our effort, we will be known in the whole city. But you can not just believe in my effort. You must see concrete actions. That is why we plan to have an advertising campaign, that will make us known, so we reduce the chance of failing.</p>
<p>Also, our first option is to be in a shopping center. Why? Because it brings much more public, than just being in a street. Most of the successful stores in Santiago are in shopping centers. That is the best way to have success.</p>
<p>In case you still unsecure, we have other plans, like free tasting outside the store, opening offers, and others.</p>
<p>That is our plan to avoid risks.</p>

John, I should point out, did not have a drone, and didn’t get power back for quite some time after I did {Insert winky face emoji here}! We began to brainstorm about how we could design a system to quickly organize volunteer drone owners to respond to similar incidents in the future.</p><p>Other team members quickly pitched in, and within hours we’d found no fewer than twenty news stories of amateur drone operators who had done much more than help restore electricity to a neighborhood – they had saved lives! We were inspired, and by Monday morning, DART was an official entity.</p><p>Over the next two weeks, I met with anyone who would talk to me, desperate for someone–anyone!–to tell me why this wouldn’t work. I met with the FAA, TSA, FEMA, Homeland Security, local authorities, state authorities, and federal officials from every agency you can think of… including a few I’d never heard of!</p><p><strong>Seemingly overnight it went from me asking agencies “Could this make a difference? Are there reasons why it wouldn’t work?” to those same organizations making daily phone calls to my office, asking me how quickly DART would be operational.</strong></p><p>Since then, our team has worked tirelessly, designing the core application that will push public alerts to the mobile applications our volunteers will use in the field.</p><p>To date, the project has been entirely self-funded. However, the hugely positive response we have received has meant that we have had to re-engineer our system to be much more robust. We’ve added improved geolocation capabilities and much more sophisticated event monitoring, evaluation, and notification. We have enhanced our focus on privacy and compliance and implemented training, exercise, and volunteer feedback channels.</p><p>We are very proud of what our team has accomplished so far, but these improvements come at a cost, and the enhanced system will require ongoing support fees higher than we anticipated.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We are passionately committed to launching this product.

 What We NeedOur team has put our heart and soul into this project and will continue to do so.  There are no plans for full-time staff and all funds raised will be used solely for platform development, outside technical services, legal compliance support, marketing, ongoing administrative costs, and other expenses any new venture encounters.Your financial assistance will accelerate implementation of the DART platform.  Furthermore, we have been asked, and sincerely want to expand DART services to more countries.  How many countries we will be able to support, and when, is largely dependent on your support.While our team will continue to volunteer countless hours, we are seeking $85K to ensure DART is operationally funded through initial launch.  Once launched, we will be working aggressively on multiple contract and grant opportunities to support ongoing operations.  We have already identified those potential sources and are confident they will be secured quickly after launch.  Of course, funds raised beyond $85K will extend the available operational period and the number of countries we can support.
 What If we don’t reach $85K?This project is personal to us.  It’s now in our DNA.  We will successfully launch after the first of the year.  We believe in the mission.  We believe in the product.  We owe it to the pilots and communities whom we have promised delivery.  It may be more challenging, but we’ll get there.  Hopefully, with your help, it’s a moot point.The Amazing DART Team
 The ImpactIn our video, we highlighted just a few stories of how truistic drone owners positively impacted a few lives.  There are certainly more.  But each of those had one thing in common, luck that a drone owner just “happened” to be nearby and aware.  We know that if thousands of like-minded pilots can be made aware of similar events, the impact to society will be miraculous.  It is that knowledge that drives our teams.  It is that knowledge that we hope will motivate you to help.
 Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word! Tell your friends, post on Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, whatever you use.Facebook: FlyWithDartTwitter: @flywithdartInstagram: @flywithdartPlease share with your drone enthusiast friends.  We are signing up pilots now and recruiting pilot beta testers for new platform evaluation.https://www.flywithdart.com",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

and offered associated merchandise, photo opportunities, and promotional
opportunities to the general public. </b></p>
<p><b>Autovia was able to establish and developed a
relationship with Chrysler Motors Lamborghini Division, securing rights to use
the then-new Lamborghini logo and badge  on retail items.  Autovia received support for this endeavor from the Chrysler Lamborghini division
vice-president, upon learning of Autovia's business plan exclaimed, “What a
great idea!”  Through the generosity and encouragement of Lamborghini,
Autovia became the first retailer in the world to be given access and rights to
the current Lamborghini logo.</b></p>

with and sanctioned by the Colorado Highway Patrol.  The poster, titled
“Your Worst Nightmare,” was one of the top five most popular posters sold in

Estes Park, Colorado, one of America's premier tourists destinations.  Located at the East entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park, this
is where the concept proved so successful in 1988. The AutoExotica drive through some of America's
most scenic regions on smooth winding mountain roads
is exhilarating and forever memorable.







                                 

Through the phenomenon of crowd funding, you can become
CONCEPTUAL OWNER of one of the most extraordinary automobiles on the
planet...the car of your dreams and the dreams of millions of others.   If you are over 18, live anywhere in the contiguous USA or Canada, you can be owner
of one of the most beautifully designed exotic cars in the world...a Lamborghini.  
Now, when you ask for a Lamborghini for Christmas or for
your birthday, you can actually get the real thing...conceptual ownership of a real Lamborghini!  No more plastic, toy
Lamborghini in your stocking...we are talking the real deal!  And, this is
a extraordinary and unique gift for multiple occasions: Christmas, birthday, anniversary, Valentine's Day, Hanukkah,
bar mitzvah, graduation...any occasion where something unique and
different is indicated and would be truly appreciated. 

WARNING:  If you win the Great AutoExotica Give Away beware: Lamborghini ownership is not for the timid.  Be prepared to be the center of attention where ever you take your car. 

As a matter of fact, buy an ownership for ALL
your friends, kids or grandchildren!  Talk about the ULTIMATE GIFT!  Imagine saying, ""I got a Lamborghini for my birthday""!

The Great AutoExotica
Give Away!
We at AutoExotica decided that once
we have concluded commercial use of our Lamborghini, rather than trade
in the vehicle for a replacement for our exotic ""stable"" inventory,
we will give the cars away to one of our crowdfunding contributors as our
rather extraordinary gift and ""thank you"" for supporting us at our inception.  
For
every $100 contributed in the conceptual ownership, the purchaser receives one
entry in the Great AutoExotica Give Away drawing to be help in 2018.  Your name will be placed in a random selection process for the opportunity to own free and clear title to this exotic automobile.  AutoExotic is giving away to one fortunate contributor FULL TITLE OWNERSHIP of this exotic automobile (certain taxes and licensing fees may apply and will be the responsibility of the winner).  Your conceptually owned exotic car could become your car with free and clear title, if your name is drawn.  The drawing will be held at a time and place to be determined by AutoExotica, but not more than two years from the Estes Park opening date.  The car will be delivered to the winner at AutoExotica's Estes Park location, and winner will be responsible to transport the car from that location.
is only for the car to which crowd funding participants supported in the
initial campaign. The car is offered to the Great AutoExotica Give Away for
this purpose in ""as is"" condition and “where is” location.  Winner must be 18 years or older.  Of course, taxes may apply and the winner is responsible to pay all taxes,
licensing and other government mandated fees. The winner is advised to consult
their tax advisor in this regard, and make a decision to accept
the vehicle based on such advice.  The Great AutoExotica Give
Away is not intended to be a ""lottery"" or ""raffle"" and
rules governing such should not apply, however, laws in your state of residence
may apply.  If the this Indeigogo campaign does not reach its full goal of $800,000 no drawing or ""give away"" will occur.

CONCEPTUAL
OWNER means for this purpose you may claim ownership of the exotic car of your
choice as one of multiple owners.  You will not have any legal responsibilities
of ownership, financial or otherwise, and for obvious reasons will have no
actual control or influence over the vehicle in any way.  You have no
exposure to liability associated with the automobile, financial or otherwise.
You will have use of your vehicle based on your specific contracted ownership
agreement, with no use implied beyond that permitted in that agreement. 
By payment of your ownership fee, you agree to the terms of the Conceptual
Ownership Agreement, and AutoExotica Ltd. reserves the right to periodically
and without prior notification, make changes to that agreement that will become
legally binding.  AutoExotica Ltd. retains rights to full use and control
of your conceptually-owned vehicle without first obtaining your permission, either
individually or as a group of collective Conceptual owners.

Our History of Success
This is a business concept that has already been
successfully tested and proven.  Conceived of and developed in 1988, and
launched under the name Autovia, Ltd., the business sold rides in exotic cars,
and offered associated merchandise, photo opportunities, and promotional
opportunities to the general public. 
Autovia was able to establish and developed a
relationship with Chrysler Motors Lamborghini Division, securing rights to use
the then-new Lamborghini logo and badge  on retail items.  Autovia received support for this endeavor from the Chrysler Lamborghini division
vice-president, upon learning of Autovia's business plan exclaimed, “What a
great idea!”  Through the generosity and encouragement of Lamborghini,
Autovia became the first retailer in the world to be given access and rights to
the current Lamborghini logo.
Autovia created a first-of-its-kind poster in conjunction
with and sanctioned by the Colorado Highway Patrol.  The poster, titled
“Your Worst Nightmare,” was one of the top five most popular posters sold in
the USA in 1988.



© 1988
Autovia, Ltd and Bert Bergland

 

Autovia, located in Estes Park, Colorado, an
internationally renowned mountain resort and hometown for Rocky Mountain
National Park, was selling an average of 40 rides a day to a wide ranging
demographic group. The business proved so instantly successful that it became
apparent within two weeks of opening it was necessary to purchase a third
Lamborghini.
The attraction of these exotics and the appeal to such a
wide demographics was truly remarkable.  What was originally expected to
be a business concept appealing to males between ages 7 and 27, actually prove
appealing to both genders and even to  adults in their 80s!  Customers quite literally drove thousands of miles for a Lamborghini Autovia experience.
The Autovia idea remains as viable and exciting a business
prospect now as it was 25 years ago.  The excitement, the appeal, the
interest, the curiosity and the thrill surrounding exotic cars has never
subsided, and an entirely new generation of exotic auto enthusiasts is now on
the scene.   In fact, after 27 years, people still remember with excitement their Lamborghini
ride in Estes Park; it is truly the ride of a lifetime!
Become an integral and important part of creating
this unique business, and make your own and others' dream come
true.  Who knows, perhaps you'll be the one who eventually drives home the AutoExotica Lamborghini!  And, give this remarkable gift to someone you care about.",7.0,2,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Summary of Celata Aircraft's Crowd Funding Campaign</p>
<p>• Introduction<br/>
My name is Richard Celata and I am president of Celata Aircraft (formerly
Celata Engineering). We have been machining aircraft parts since 1979, making
parts for G.E. jet engines, Boeing, and McDonald Douglas Aircraft as well as
N.A.S.A.’s land rover. We have also manufactured parts for several
non-aerospace companies such as Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution’s
A.L.V.I.N. submarine (the mechanical arm which retrieved items from the Titanic), Polaroid, Sylvania, Sturm &amp; Ruger, and others.</p><p>• Our Campaign<br/></p>While taking my Private Pilots training, I was required to do a cross-country
flight. I was lucky enough to be able to talk my instructor into combining my
certification flight with my need to deliver some parts to a customer in Texas.
We flew a Cessna 172 from Dillon, Montana to Houston, Texas. Fourteen hours and
5 fuel stops later, we arrived. (Then we had to come back.) <br/><br/>I had already begun
building a plane that had the same flight performance as the 172, but after
that trip I realized that I needed something faster. Here is where my search
for a 240+ MPH DIY Home Build aircraft started. The only DIY Home Build
aircraft with the characteristics I required was a “plans-only build”. This
means you get a set of plans and you make every part, and 4,000+ hours later
you have a 240 MPH plane.<br/><br/><p>Our goal is to build Ready To Fly (RTF) aircraft and kits at a reasonable
price for the General Aviation market by developing new and faster
manufacturing processes. These processes will include improving traditional
construction methods, as well as utilizing new materials, manufacturing and
construction methods.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444164883/ivhfceypw2fsrurpd5lb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                      Rib Jigs for the GP-4.<br/><br/>
<p>This “plans-only build” aircraft we decided on is a superb airframe,
designed in the mid 80’s, and listed as a 4,000-hour build (average is actually 6,500 hours) is
unacceptable to us, and to most builders. The fact is, most ""Home-builders"" start their build as ""empty nesters"" (between 50 and 60 years of age) and with an average build time of 6,500 hours, that translates into 10 to 13 years. There is a high number of builders that pass away, or can no long pass their medical to fly before finishing the aircraft. <br/></p><p>                     Their unfinished airframe is sold for pennies on the dollar. <br/></p><p></p><p>               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444165029/a3wmbyhuihgc5nrafyto.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444195938/bpgcmijllgmaaootrmfk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>We have set out to solve this problem. After purchasing the GP-4 plans and studying
them for a month, I realized I could manufacture a kit; faster, cheaper, and a
higher quality than could be built from the original plans.<br/><br/> We also intend to build a 60 size Radio Controlled model of the GP-4.<br/><br/>
<p>This is our goal: to make kits that can be built by the home builder in
about 1,000 hours (in 500 hours at our shop). We have already achieved
building the tail feathers in a weekend from the kit we will sell. </p>
<p>Further, our kits will be easy to assemble. If you have ever built a Radio
Controlled model airplane, you will be able to build our kit with complete confidence
that you will have a safe FAA approved airframe. With our “Stage II” campaign
goal, we will have a new 20,000 sq ft facility with a “Builder Assist” program.
(You can receive a BA from Celata Aircraft.) Our BA program will allow the
builder to come to our State-of-the-Art facility, and build their aircraft.</p><p>
Our “Stage III” campaign will be R&amp;D for new aircraft.</p>
<p>• What You as a Contributor Will Help Us Achieve.</p><p>
With your help, we can fund the necessary tooling, CAD/CAM programming and
purchase the remaining materials. Without your help, it will take years longer
to achieve. We are a debt free company, we do not take interest bearing loans,
and everything we own is paid for. Doing business in this manner makes capital
purchases slower and much more time-consuming, but also makes our company
stable.</p>
<p>• What We Need and What You Get</p>
<p>We are looking to raise; Stage I: $500,000, up to 2 million total for Stage II
and Stage III. This is broken down into CF fees 5%, Taxes 33+%, and 62% for
labor, materials, and perks.</p>• If We Do Not Reach our Funding Goal.<br/><br/>
<p>Where do the funds go if we are not fully funded? Back to you, of course. We
will not start this project unless we are fully funded. We have no desire to
start and not finish; we like to succeed, not fail. This is also why we decided
back in the early 1980s to maintain our debt free status.</p>
<p>•The Impact of Our Campaign </p>
<p>Stage one: $500,000: Our first Ready-To-Fly plane will be dedicated to my brother,
Stephen Celata, who passed away in June 2015 while waiting for a heart
transplant. Stephen (AKA: Andy Blacksmith) was a beloved morning radio
personality on WHEB 100.3 in New Hampshire.</p><p></p><p>                                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444165581/lqykddliraydzven9vot.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>                                                     Andy in his prime.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444165596/wjyin2hjxhqwinsjnxbh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>                  Telling listeners about how important it is to be an organ donor.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444165604/ckkugzj6ypkd14stsnu5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                         Waiting for a heart.<br/><br/>
<p>Once we are fully funded (Stage I) we will produce the first Ready-To-Fly aircraft
(the Blacksmith.) Then we will tour New England, ending in Oshkosh, Wisconsin,
and raffle off the “Blacksmith” with all the proceeds going to “Donate Life New
England” to help promote organ donation.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444165847/h235mrlsmnlx8boy8yjn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><a href=""http://donatelifenewengland.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">                                                  Donate Life New England</a><br/><br/>
<p>Our goal with the ""Blacksmith"" is to bring awareness of how many people die for lack of donors. <br/></p><p>Stage two: and additional $1,000,000: We will build a new 20,000 sq ft facility at the
airport (site already secured) where we can build, assemble, paint, employ
up to 25 full time workers, and start our Builders Assist Program.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444166462/pemde4fsxfxhgf5lyvsb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                  Our conceptual buildings.<br/><br/>
<p>Stage three: $500,000: Take our GP-4 into the age of Carbon Fiber (CF)
construction, and R&amp;D for new aircraft. CF is stronger, lighter, and requires less
maintenance (corrosion). Our total goal for all three stages is $2
million.</p>
<p>If we reach our $2 million goal, we will make a donation on every sale to Donate Life New England.</p>
<p>We are already manufacturing GP-4 parts for those who have started their GP-4
“plans-only build”, and would like to bring this to the next step, kits and RTFs. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444166693/bxsvmzljdjiw25uuugpg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>                                                             GP-4 Ruder hinges <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444166740/xpf9cscm1kjxjra1hhxj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                         GP-4 Engine mount.<br/><br/>
<p>We have always done “design engineering from prototype to final assembly”. I
hold one U.S. patent. We have successfully designed, manufactured, and marketed
the world famous B52 fly Cutter, a cutting tool for machine shops. Harley
Davidson requires all their repair shops to have B52 fly cutters for machining
their engine blocks and cylinder heads. Also, the Big 3 (Chevy, Ford, Chrysler)
all use our B52s.</p><p></p><p></p><p>                                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444194012/oapyjx8ewreuodovr8mq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>                                                          The B52 Fly Cutters.<br/><br/>
<p>• Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>One of the challenges we have already overcome was that the
“build-only” plans were incomplete. We have spent 3 months, painstakingly converting the 1980s hand drawn blue prints to
CAD, which pointed out where all the parts did not fit exactly. Thus we were
able to avoid making the parts wrong, and then having to make them over to fit
properly (one of the reasons for the 6,500 hour build time), saving time and money. Like any “machine building” process, there
will be revisions, and we have accounted for this. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444197975/udrjmznyhyqoajyy4uhw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p> The designer of the aircraft is also working with us if the need arises.</p>
<p>With 36 years of experience in not only parts manufacturing, but full machine
design, manufacturing, and assembly (over half of which having been machines
where failure could result in personal injury or death), we fully understand
our responsibility to provide a safe and superior aircraft.</p><p></p><p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444166845/mrq6betzkh4tpce5gqcg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>                                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444235149/wkg9ysh8mfkamzim3haw.png"" src="""" style=""width: 235.364px; height: 339px;""/></p><br/>

We are looking to raise; Stage I: $500,000, up to 2 million total for Stage II
and Stage III. This is broken down into CF fees 5%, Taxes 33+%, and 62% for
labor, materials, and perks.• If We Do Not Reach our Funding Goal.
Where do the funds go if we are not fully funded? Back to you, of course. We
will not start this project unless we are fully funded. We have no desire to
start and not finish; we like to succeed, not fail. This is also why we decided
back in the early 1980s to maintain our debt free status.
•The Impact of Our Campaign 
Stage one: $500,000: Our first Ready-To-Fly plane will be dedicated to my brother,
Stephen Celata, who passed away in June 2015 while waiting for a heart
transplant. Stephen (AKA: Andy Blacksmith) was a beloved morning radio
personality on WHEB 100.3 in New Hampshire.                                                                                     Andy in his prime.                  Telling listeners about how important it is to be an organ donor.                                                         Waiting for a heart.
Once we are fully funded (Stage I) we will produce the first Ready-To-Fly aircraft
(the Blacksmith.) Then we will tour New England, ending in Oshkosh, Wisconsin,
and raffle off the “Blacksmith” with all the proceeds going to “Donate Life New
England” to help promote organ donation.                                                  Donate Life New England
Our goal with the ""Blacksmith"" is to bring awareness of how many people die for lack of donors. Stage two: and additional $1,000,000: We will build a new 20,000 sq ft facility at the
airport (site already secured) where we can build, assemble, paint, employ
up to 25 full time workers, and start our Builders Assist Program.                                                  Our conceptual buildings.
Stage three: $500,000: Take our GP-4 into the age of Carbon Fiber (CF)
construction, and R&D for new aircraft. CF is stronger, lighter, and requires less
maintenance (corrosion). Our total goal for all three stages is $2
million.
If we reach our $2 million goal, we will make a donation on every sale to Donate Life New England.
We are already manufacturing GP-4 parts for those who have started their GP-4
“plans-only build”, and would like to bring this to the next step, kits and RTFs.                                                              GP-4 Ruder hinges                                                          GP-4 Engine mount.
We have always done “design engineering from prototype to final assembly”. I
hold one U.S. patent. We have successfully designed, manufactured, and marketed
the world famous B52 fly Cutter, a cutting tool for machine shops. Harley
Davidson requires all their repair shops to have B52 fly cutters for machining
their engine blocks and cylinder heads. Also, the Big 3 (Chevy, Ford, Chrysler)
all use our B52s.                                                                                                    The B52 Fly Cutters.
• Risks & Challenges
One of the challenges we have already overcome was that the
“build-only” plans were incomplete. We have spent 3 months, painstakingly converting the 1980s hand drawn blue prints to
CAD, which pointed out where all the parts did not fit exactly. Thus we were
able to avoid making the parts wrong, and then having to make them over to fit
properly (one of the reasons for the 6,500 hour build time), saving time and money. Like any “machine building” process, there
will be revisions, and we have accounted for this. 
 The designer of the aircraft is also working with us if the need arises.
With 36 years of experience in not only parts manufacturing, but full machine
design, manufacturing, and assembly (over half of which having been machines
where failure could result in personal injury or death), we fully understand
our responsibility to provide a safe and superior aircraft.

</div><blockquote>Note: Besides the detox powder, all other products will be delivered in digital format in order to save trees.</blockquote><h2>Have You Been A Victim Of Toxic Supplements?</h2><div>
</div><p>With 80,000 new chemicals
introduced into the world each year the question becomes less about whether or
not you should detox and more about how you need to go about detoxing.
Environmental toxins have become a global problem with countries like China
Leading the way in overall toxicity and the sickness and pain that comes along
with it (more on this later). </p><div>
</div><p>The question “how do I detox?” is
a hard question to answer. In fact, if you search “detox Supplements” Google
comes up with over 2.5 million results.<span> 
The sad thing about the vast majority of these supplements is that they
are not built on sound science. Supplement company owners often cut corners in
order to increase profits and cut costs. Contaminated Chinese herbs and toxic
“detox” supplements are not uncommon, ironic right? By producing cheap
ineffective products these companies are not only increasing the amount of
confusion in the world in regards to health and supplementation but they are also
using people’s emotions and illnesses against them, not cool. </span></p><div>
</div><p>Our Detox Box will contain what
we (and many others) believe to be the world’s most effective detoxing
ingredients. On top of that we also give you the most up to date info on how to
completely detox your life. We show you what natural cleaners are best, we
explain the difference between organic and non-organic food, we teach you about
GMO’s, pesticides, water purification and so much more. You will notice a
dramatic increase in your overall health and energy levels. This is, according
to our knowledge and research, the healthiest, easiest, best-tasting, most
effective detox ever created.<span>  On top of
all that it is certified Organic and packed in environmentally friendly
packaging. By applying what you learn from your Detox Box you will feel
significantly better and help clean up our contaminated yet beautiful world. </span></p><div>
</div><h2>So, what makes this ""Detox Powder"" so powerful anyway?</h2><div>
</div><p><b>Ingredient:</b>
10 grams organic non-denatured whey protein.</p><div>
</div><p><b>What it will do for you: </b>There are over 10,000 different proteins in your body.
Protein is vital for your overall health. Many cleanses on the market today
have you go without protein during your cleanse to increase detoxification.
This idea is outdated and has been proven ineffective. In fact, your body needs
various amino acids in order to help support healthy detoxification of the
liver. Without protein your body can only complete about half of the detoxification
process which leaves you feeling sick and allows toxins to float around in your
blood and get reabsorbed.</p><div>
</div><p><b>Ingredient:</b>
3 g MCT oil from organic coconuts</p><div>
</div><p><b>What it will do for you:</b> MCT’s are a healthy form of fats that are processed
differently in the body. Your body uses MCT’s to flow through your lymphatic
system which is one of your body’s major detox pathways. Organic MCT’s from
coconut oil are antiviral and help to support the detoxification of the lymph
which is very important these days since most people have a backed up lymphatic
system. MCT’s are also a preferred source of energy in the body and will help
reteach your body to burn fat instead of store it. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Ingredient:</b>
Organic plant sourced vitamins and cofactors</p><div>
</div><p><b>What it will do for you: </b>The vitamins in our Detox Box are incredible to say the
least. They are 100% organic and come from water based extracts complete with
all naturally occurring co-factors and co-nutrients. This means your body can
better absorb our vitamins and put them to work. Most supplement companies get
their synthetic vitamins from one of the worlds most polluted countries, China,
and then they sell them for a high cost on the shelves of our health food
stores. I don’t know about you but that just doesn’t seem right to me.</p><div>
</div><p><b>Ingredient:</b>
Organic Plant sourced Minerals</p><div>
</div><p><b>What it will do for you: </b>Minerals benefit your body in many ways. You may notice improved brain health (mental clarity), a reduction
in muscle pain, improved sexual health, healthier skin, nails, and hair, and an
improved memory. Most of the mineral products on the market are processed with
toxic processing aids which can negate many of the benefits of the mineral
itself. We use organic, all natural processing aids that are actually good for
you. </p><div>
</div><p><b>Ingredient:</b>
Nature’s most effective organic detox herbs</p><div>
</div><p><b>What it will do for you: </b>Now that your body’s natural detox pathways are up and
running at top speed we use the power of organic detoxification herbs to help
send toxins through your elimination pathways. When you’re cleaner on the
inside it shows on the outside. You’ll feel much more energetic!</p><div>
</div><p><b>Ingredient:</b>
Nature’s most effective anti-cancer and detox Fruits and Vegetables</p><div>
</div><p><b>What it will do for you: </b>Cancer rates are skyrocketing in America. This is largely
due to the fact that we don’t eat enough high quality, organic vegetables and
fruits and we eat way too much sugar and chemically laden “frankenfood.”Many
experts believe that over 95% of cancer can be avoided by changing how we live
and eat. Our organic fruits and veggies help you take a step in the right
direction.</p><div>
</div><p>As you may have noticed from the
list above, detoxing is not always a simple process. Before our world became so
contaminated, our bodies could easily keep up with the toxic exposure normal to
everyday life. As our environment becomes increasingly toxic it becomes more
and more important to help your body clean itself out in the most effective way
possible.</p><div>
</div><p>Instead of forcing your body to
detox by using harsh laxatives or crazy liver purging techniques we support
your body’s natural biochemical detox pathways. Not only is our approach far
more effective than the aforementioned techniques but it will leave you feeling
exponentially more energetic, vibrant, and alive. You can expect to lose weight
and feel 10 years younger.</p><div>
</div><p>In order for the body to truly
detox itself it needs adequate amounts of conjugating substances. Most of these
substances come from amino acids. To properly support this process vitamins and
minerals must come with their accompanying cofactors. These cofactors are not
part of the synthetic vitamins that make up the majority of dietary supplements
found on the market today which is another reason why other supplements are far
less effective and potentially dangerous. </p><div>
</div><p>Anyway, I could talk about
supplements and health forever but let’s move on to what we need and what you
get. If you have any questions that are not answered in the campaign please

products"" of the reaction—water vapor and heat. Some of the water vapor
gets recycled for use in water tank. This cycle proceeds continuously as long
while there is a decomposition of water.</p>

fuel cell delivers a low voltage. The more layers, the higher the voltage.

How our batteries work.



Working principle of our batteries

A battery is an electrochemical device in which electrical energy is
converted and stored in chemical form for storage.
Two electrodes (positive and negative, of the two chemically different
materials) are separated proton exchange membrane.
The alloy (positive electrode) serves as a sponge, saturated hydrogen.
Proton exchange membrane (PEM) provide high power density and the
advantages of low weight and volume compared to other types of battery’s.
This special membrane is porous to protons but not electrons.
The protons and electrons are separated by the action of a platinum
catalyst in the electrodes.
The protons can diffuse directly through the membrane but the electrons
have to make their way through an external circuit to reach the other side,
providing power.

We're Steph and Seth and we're so glad you stopped by to check out our IndieGoGo campaign ""Grand Lancaster Adventure Kayak Tours"".What is it?We've spent the last four years wandering around Lancaster County with our family and sharing what we find on Seth's blog at amishroadshow.com. One thing we've discovered is our favorite way to get out and explore. We love hopping on our kayaks and spending a few hours navigating the waterways around the area.Ever since we've started sharing photos and videos out on the kayaks we received a ton of interest in joining us for the fun. So we started taking a look at what it would take to offer tours down the Conestoga River. It's didn't take us long to say ""LETS DO THIS"".What will the tour be like? AWESOME!! No seriously, it's going to be a lot of fun. We've selected a portion of the Conestoga River that has easy access to many of the main routes coming into Lancaster. It's not far from a number of tourist attractions, as well as Downtown. Whether you're a local or a wanderer, this will be a nice ride. 


The section we've chosen comes out to about 3.5 miles. So until you add in the drive time and every it's ... yeah, it's a 3 hour tour. Not to worry though, this section is mild enough to keep you entertained while allowing a more diverse group of people be able to come along and join the fun.


Parts of the tour will be heavily wooded with large cliffs along the side. While other sections are much more open and offer spectacular countryside views you've probably never seen before. There will also be a variety animals like cows, horses, birds, turtles, ground hogs, and other wildlife.


view our 360 pano of the bridge here!!

Another advantage to this location is that we will be passing under two covered bridges, We'll pick you up at the endpoint and give you a ride to the where we'll begin. On the road we will be crossing over both covered bridges. I will also be pointing out a few favorite photos spots of mine. As the campaign rages on I will be sharing more info of what to expect on my blog at http://arslanc.com.
Why IndieGoGo?To help see this plan through we need to pick up a few things like kayaks, paddles, life jackets, insurance, first aid supplies, and few other critical items. We are very excited to be able to reach out to our family, friends, and fans to get this project off the ground! Because you are willing to contribute to help us secure the equipment, we are willing to contribute our time to ensuring you have a great experience.That's where you come in, when you sign up to contribute you get a perk in return. In this case we're pre-selling tickets to the tour itself! This seemed like a great way to fund the project rather than seeking out investors or applying for loans. We’re going grassroots crowdfunding DYI on this one, and proud of it!The PerksThere are three perks to choose from The first perk is the 2015 Solo Tour. Since we’re already into the summer we have a limited number of seats available. As soon as the project is funded we will reach out to these contributors to book your tour. The second perk is the 2015/2016 Open Ticket. This means you get first selection for next year, or we can fit you in after the 2015 Solo Tour ticket holders book their tours.The third option is for land lovers who support our goal and would like to contribute. You get the opportunity to impact a young person when we start our Jr. ExplorARS Program next year.Due to the limited nature of the “2015 Solo Tour” you have to submit a separate contribution for each rider. It can be on the same Indiegog account, but it has to be individual contributions. Sorry for the inconvenience, it’ll be worth it ;)It should also be noted that we currently have a weight restriction of 275 lbs, riders must be physically capable with a certain level of dexterity to participate safely, and the age limit is 16 with a parent or guardian. We would for everyone to enjoy the fun, but safety will always be a top priority for us. Regardless which perk you choose we have a lot of love for your support. All campaign contributors will be members of our Contributors Club and receive lifetime discounts on future tours. Your name will also go on our ""Wall of Fame"" on the site to show you've been a supporter from the beginning.Potential PitfallsWe've set this campaign at a fixed amount.

A Company of Enthusiasts<br/></b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Hydra was born from the desire of Ivan Marsilii to create
enthusiast grade computer hardware shaped by enthusiasts themselves. In his
vision, the best way to do this was to gather projects developed by the
community, and unite them under one banner, Hydra.</span></p><p><br/>
<b>A Collective Effort</b><br/>

Two heads are better than one, and a community is better than both. All of
our products are developed with the invaluable help of community feedback,
involving forums, groups and modders in every design step, creating a product
that matches the needs and desires of the enthusiast crowd; they tell us what they desire, and we shape our products around that.<br/><br/><b>Attention to Detail</b><br/>Being PC enthusiasts ourselves, we understand the inherit value of a well-made, easy to customize product that can be modded without frustration or useless complications.  All of our products undergo a rigorous design and prototyping phase, where we work out any and all bug we can find, to deliver you the best possible product. <br/><br/>
<b>An Open Company</b><br/>
Since the very beginning, Hydra has accepted feedback and projects for the

</div></div>","IMPORTANT for USA contributors - please select the appropriate perk from the list for the shipping of your case/desk. You will notice they are divided in 3 categories by ""shipping distance"", so that you can choose the relevant one without paying extra for shipping.Our GoalOur dream is the creation of a hardware company where enthusiasts and modders can have their say, suggest changes and products, developing everything with the help and around the community, giving anyone the change to bring their idea to life.
A Company of EnthusiastsHydra was born from the desire of Ivan Marsilii to create
enthusiast grade computer hardware shaped by enthusiasts themselves. In his
vision, the best way to do this was to gather projects developed by the
community, and unite them under one banner, Hydra.
A Collective Effort

Two heads are better than one, and a community is better than both. All of
our products are developed with the invaluable help of community feedback,
involving forums, groups and modders in every design step, creating a product
that matches the needs and desires of the enthusiast crowd; they tell us what they desire, and we shape our products around that.Attention to DetailBeing PC enthusiasts ourselves, we understand the inherit value of a well-made, easy to customize product that can be modded without frustration or useless complications.  All of our products undergo a rigorous design and prototyping phase, where we work out any and all bug we can find, to deliver you the best possible product. 
An Open Company
Since the very beginning, Hydra has accepted feedback and projects for the
community, that’s how our first projects were born and developed; that is why
we allow anyone to submit their ideas for how we should improve upon our products. We then evaluate the feasibility of the idea, run it by the
community and if it meets success, we then start the implementation processThe Hydra Desk (feedback and ideas from Toms Hardware forums, Italian fb groups )The Hydra Desk is a spacious Desk Case designed for those who want compromise-free building and modding capabilities. With it's 1.5mm thick, powered coated aluminum structure, 8mm thick tempered glass surface resting on rubber seal, space for 5 x 360mm radiators and an additional 480mm, along with dedicated cable management and routing space, the Hydra Desk aims to set a new standard in Deks Case design.""Virus"" mod by Yuri Gabrielli inside one of your final prototypes.""Virus"" mod by Yuri Gabrielli inside one of your final prototypes.Quick Specs: - Dimensions (WxDxH): 1509 x 713 x 755- Supports up to 5 x 360mm radiators + 1 x 480mm rad - Motherboard support from E-ATX to mini-ITX - Native support for up to 12 x 3.5"" drives or 16 x 2.5"" Drives - 2 ATX PSUs of any size - A total of 6 x 5.25"" slots (2 double ones and 2 single ones) - 16mm green LED momentary power button included - CNC machined feet with antislide oring and adjustable height - Ample sitting space (h 615 x w 827 x d 710mm) - 8 mm thick tempered glass surface - Structure in 1.5mm thick, powder coated aluminum - Hollow leg structure for additional components/moddingNOTICE -  when choosing the Hydra Desk, please leave us a message on whether you want the standard feet or the extra-high ones (+5cm)  Defcon OneDesigned with feedback from Tom's Hardware article comments, Italian fb groups, LinusTechTips Forum and Indiegogo feedback )The Defcon One is an mATX case with a unique visual and thermal design that allows to place the GPUs on the opposite side of the motherboard and lets them always draw fresh air from outside. This configuration allows for exceptional thermal performance for air cooled GPUs while allowing us to keep the frame compact, and allowing the user to place the case on either side of the monitor without loosing component visibility.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Perks Information
As you can see we have more than one version per perk. This is because we got many requests for unpainted versions that could be customized or people who wanted to use their own.Same goes for the risers in the Defcon One and Hydra Crystal - you can either get our riser guaranteed by the manufacturer, or use your own.We therefore made multiple versions of the perk, so be sure to check properly which one you are getting! IMPORTANT for USA contributors - please select the appropriate perk from the list for the shipping of your case/desk.You will notice they are divided in 3 categories by ""shipping distance"", so that you can choose the relevant one without paying extra for shipping.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ChallangesWe have worked on the Hydra Desk and Defcon One for over a year, changing and adapting their features to community feedback to deliver you the best possible product. The Defcon One already passed a successful crowdfundign campaign on indiegogo, which changed it quite a bit and morphed it into what we have today.As we worked on these projects, we also developed a number of concepts; two of these, the NR-01 and the Crystal made it to prototyping.Based on popular demand, we've added them to the crowdfunding.They are in the final prototype stages, and we'll finish the final version by the end of the campaign, so that we're ready to start on your perks.Our team is comprised of industrial experts, mechanical engineering and design students, each operating in synergy to streamline manufacturing and delivery process as much as possible.Who talked about us

<h3>UPDATE 8 hours before campaign was over:</h3>
<p>BipCoin, alive and well. But Dot-Bip decentralized DNS is not happening. I refunded everyone's money. Did it now before campaign is over. From what Indiegogo told me, it seems like it's easier now than after campaign is over.</p>
<p>=-=-=-</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Web Censorship is a Growing Problem</h3>
<p>Many nations censor websites. And even the USA, long proud of its free speech, just elected a president who has threatened to stop journalists from criticizing him.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to skip ahead</strong> <strong>and read our whitepaper, it's here</strong>: <a href=""https://bipcoin.org/ASSETS/WP/Dot-Bip_whitepaper.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480106037/hbymgeiv8t9bmsmwvn0p.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Michael Dean and Dot-Bip team member Derrick Slopey did the FeenPhone campaigns on Indiegogo and  delivered on the promises of the campaigns. You can download that software and use it right now from <a href=""http://www.feenphone.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.feenphone.com </a>
</li>
<li>We have an existing cryptocurrency, BipCoin. It was released August 20, 2016. You can mine it and trade it right now. It's on an exchange and people are mining and using it. It's at <a href=""https://bipcoin.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://bipcoin.org/</a>
</li>
<li>Our plan is to add decentralized DNS to BipCoin. Like what Namecoin promised, but never delivered in a usable way that got adoption.</li>
<li>Domain squatting was a huge problem for Namecoin. We will prevent that by auto-updating the price of auto-registering a domain to what is currently 8 dollars US.</li>
<li>This is expensive enough to prevent domain squatting, but cheap enough that anyone who can afford a web host can afford an uncensorable domain.</li>
<li>We will do this by auto-pegging the amount of BipCoin to register a domain to the current price of gold. We can do this through API integration and through basically having the program do a web search and intelligently seeing which of the results are current gold prices, then averaging them.</li>
<li>It will cost half as much for the first year, to encourage adoption.</li>
<li>There will be no third-party domain registrar, and thus no single point of failure.</li>
<li>We will provide ease of use by including a system-wide Dot-Bip domain resolver right in the BipCoin wallet. No third-party plugins will be required. Namecoin has been around five years and still isn't easy to use.</li>
<li>Other corporate blockchains that promise distributed DNS-like features are actually censorable, by the board of directors, and by pressure from governments.</li>
<li>Our software is always no-cost to download and use, and the source code is available on GitHub for inspection and creating derivations.</li>
<li>Our goal is to make us, the team, unneeded within three years of release of the first proof-of-concept working version of Dot-Bip.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480107157/daihsfeywikmigt6jhrt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to hire two more top-notch C++ programmers who have blockchain experience (especially with CryptoNote). We have a team, but all the programmers have day jobs and families. The one non-programmer on the team (who came up with the concept, name and most of the whitepaper), can work full time overseeing and guiding this. So we need some hardcore full-time programmer folks to come in and kick butt full time for a little while to make this work, NOW.</li>

BipCoin, alive and well. But Dot-Bip decentralized DNS is not happening. I refunded everyone's money. Did it now before campaign is over. From what Indiegogo told me, it seems like it's easier now than after campaign is over.
=-=-=-
 
Web Censorship is a Growing Problem
Many nations censor websites. And even the USA, long proud of its free speech, just elected a president who has threatened to stop journalists from criticizing him.
If you want to skip ahead and read our whitepaper, it's here: 

Michael Dean and Dot-Bip team member Derrick Slopey did the FeenPhone campaigns on Indiegogo and  delivered on the promises of the campaigns. You can download that software and use it right now from www.feenphone.com 

We have an existing cryptocurrency, BipCoin. It was released August 20, 2016. You can mine it and trade it right now. It's on an exchange and people are mining and using it. It's at https://bipcoin.org/

Our plan is to add decentralized DNS to BipCoin. Like what Namecoin promised, but never delivered in a usable way that got adoption.
Domain squatting was a huge problem for Namecoin. We will prevent that by auto-updating the price of auto-registering a domain to what is currently 8 dollars US.
This is expensive enough to prevent domain squatting, but cheap enough that anyone who can afford a web host can afford an uncensorable domain.
We will do this by auto-pegging the amount of BipCoin to register a domain to the current price of gold. We can do this through API integration and through basically having the program do a web search and intelligently seeing which of the results are current gold prices, then averaging them.
It will cost half as much for the first year, to encourage adoption.
There will be no third-party domain registrar, and thus no single point of failure.
We will provide ease of use by including a system-wide Dot-Bip domain resolver right in the BipCoin wallet. No third-party plugins will be required. Namecoin has been around five years and still isn't easy to use.
Other corporate blockchains that promise distributed DNS-like features are actually censorable, by the board of directors, and by pressure from governments.
Our software is always no-cost to download and use, and the source code is available on GitHub for inspection and creating derivations.
Our goal is to make us, the team, unneeded within three years of release of the first proof-of-concept working version of Dot-Bip.



What We Need & What You Get

We need to hire two more top-notch C++ programmers who have blockchain experience (especially with CryptoNote). We have a team, but all the programmers have day jobs and families. The one non-programmer on the team (who came up with the concept, name and most of the whitepaper), can work full time overseeing and guiding this. So we need some hardcore full-time programmer folks to come in and kick butt full time for a little while to make this work, NOW.
We won't need repeated fundraisers. 80% of the BipCoin that people use to self-register domains will go to ongoing Dot-Bip and BipCoin ecosystem development.
The other 20% will go to four charities committed to freedom. (Free Ross, Anti-war.com, Restore the Fourth / Reinst8, and FIJA.org) Someone at each org has already agreed to this.
We'll also be providing these charities with free lifelong Dot-Bit domains and helping them configure everything.
We'll be spending some of the money on perks. Michael Dean has a 100% completion record with delivering all perks as described and on time in his 4 previous Indiegogo campaigns.
We're not charging extra money for shipping the perks. That's weak. People hate that. We'll be paying it out of our take.
We'll also be spending money on more servers, maybe some better web design, and misc. expenses. So far this has all been out of pocket, but we need your help to take it forward.
We'd love to make enough to set a little aside for any unforeseen contingencies. Including if we need to hire an attorney at any point. Trying to protect free speech is not free.
What you get: much more freedom in the world, lots of tyrants having a bad day because they can no longer ""SHUT DOWN EVERYTHING! that's said bad about them. + Some cool perks.
Even without donating, once we go live, people will be able to help, and receive a share of the domain registration fees, by running a Gold Node.

Risks & Challenges  There are limited risks to this adventure, which of course, we'll minimize as much as possible going forward.  However after looking at the books of the previous owner, we have a hard time seeing how we wouldn't make a small boutique hotel successful!  We may need to hire a full time employee for a time (as a grant requirement) and we've never had to do that... so I guess that could be a challenge!  This industry of course relies on bookings.  In crunching numbers and considering a conservative occupancy rate, we're confident we can easily continue to pay the bills. If one of us dies, that's what life insurance is for! Now if the economy really tanks and we were to be extremely slow and had low numbers of guests all year long, which I can't imagine, then we do have our current business income to rely on.  Our living quarters are attached to the motel, so the nice thing is we have no separate mortgage payment! There are virtually no other cinematic videographers in the area, so there is an untapped market for my work and I'm already in discussions with some local parties!  We also intend to operate Christi's vintage shop on site, so that is additional income we don't lose!
We also need to work with the city to ensure some of our vision, such as neon, a dock in the lake, and perhaps even a liquor license might be attainable. *Perks where a complimentary drink is mentioned should be no issue if you are personal guests to our home, which is onsite... but we'll get some clarity on that!    Other Ways You Can Help We understand you may never make it up our way to the OTHER coast... the North Coast... but you can still help tremendously if you believe in our goals!  We are currently on Facebook as TheAtomicMotelWI and  Twitter and Instagram as TheAtomicMotel. Follow us there!  Share our posts!  Talk us up in groups you're active in or to those you know come to our area. All through the remodeling process we'll be active on social media posting photos and videos so we'd love for you to follow along and share what you think is cool!
 And don't forget, you can use the Indiegogo share tools to make thinks easy for friends and family to find out what we're doing!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

GLOBAL BLUE (OCEAN) ECONOMY AFFECT US ALL</p>
<p>Two thirds of the world is water that moves over 90%
of world trade.  This global Blue Economy is fraught with multiple risks
and threats - whether you sail the seas, are a maritime enthusiast, care about
the ocean environment, or are worried about the supply chain we can provide you
with sophisticated maritime threat analysis.  </p>
<p>Hi! I am Captain Jatin Bains who
has been associated with the Blue (Ocean) Economy for 35+ years first as a ship
captain and subsequently in ship management and most recently in maritime
security. I am also the creator of the CATE (Computer Assisted Threat
Evaluation) System which can help users find the proverbial “needle in the
haystack” with regard to risks in the maritime domain.  Unfortunately,
since 9/11, maritime security has actually declined worldwide with a
significant rise in piracy, oil thefts, illegal fishing, environmental
accidents, human and arms smuggling, incursions into Exclusive Economic Zones
(EEZs), supply chain delays due to enhanced maritime security, bank liens,
arrests, negligence, and the list goes on and on. The shipping industry as a
whole operates on razor thin margins and is struggling with financial losses
leading to consolidation and bankruptcies; economies of scale are not there,
the new mega-ships are being laid-up instead of operating half empty; new regulations
like container weights and carbon emissions are cost prohibitive to the ship
operator, and there is little transparency on governance and compliance. Global
maritime safety and security enforcement is declining and current trends
indicate that 2017 will see more risk. My team and I have built over the last
15 years the CATE™ System that addresses risks and threats to the Blue
Economy.  CATE™ has been successfully deployed and used operationally in
Asia for 10 years.</p>
<p>We believe there is now an insatiable
appetite for a cost effective analysis platform that identifies these potential
maritime risks and threats. CATE™ currently develops threat analysis using 50+ data
sources and we are now in the process of adding satellite imagery data to
perform the risk evaluation. Satellite imagery is proving to be another key
data layer we are deploying and wish to ingest more on a global scale.  We
are seeking funding now to scale the CATE™ System to include more satellite
data and deploy it as a Software as a Service (SaaS) model to bring the price
point down. To do this we need to raise $5 Million to buy additional satellite
data, scale CATE™ and to build an effective marketing campaign. I have built
and enhanced the CATE™ platform with a bootstrap budget over 15 years and we
have been good stewards of public funds.</p>
<p>I am now able to share the analysis we
perform as “Perks” with you and feel it is of interest to boaters, maritime
enthusiasts, supply chain logisticians, environmentalists, security and safety
professionals, etc. The Blue Economy affects all of us and ‘knowledge is
power.’ I want to be able to offer our military grade technology to ordinary
users at an affordable price. This is possible with cloud computing and a SaaS
delivery model using a simple browser.</p>
<p>As an example, over $20 Billion of fish is
stolen illegally from African waters every year. We can give anyone
interested in helping the African governments secure their fishing rights by
using CATE™.  The impact to African economies could be a game
changer.  As CATE™ risk modeling capability become available to more people
around the world the global community can help Africa enhance its coastal
awareness and give them a tool to go after the poachers. Help us counter the
growing risks of operating in the Blue Economy and make a contribution to
building a safer world for us and the next generation.</p><p></p><p> <a href=""https://www.catetech.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Blue Economy Risk Portal is in Beta Testing with live data.</a></p><p><i>Please help us scale and thanks in advance for your consideration.</i></p></div>","RISKS AND THREATS IN THE

<p>Pokreće nas to da <i>ono što obično nedostaje nisu nove ideje, nego volja da se one realizuju. </i><br/>Mnogi mladi umjetnici ,fotografi, dizajneri, filmmakeri,...  - kreatori općenito, i čak starije kolege imaju potrebu za prostorom u kojem mogu udobno boraviti, družiti se, upoznavati nove ljude, prezentovati svoj rad, održati radionicu, prisustvovati radionici, naučiti nove stvari i ostvarivati saradnje.</p>
<p><strong>We're driven by our collective will to create, to realize an idea, have it come to life, not just to have one. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A plethora of young artists, photographers, designers, and generally creative people, no matter their age, need such a space where they can feel comfortable, feel welcome so that they can meet new people, socialize, share ideas, host workshops, presentations. They need a chance for a fresh perspective, a fresh set of eyes on their creations, and a place where they can learn new things and a chance for new opportunities.</strong></p>
<p><br/><i>Prostor je najneuhvatljivija stvar</i> je rečenica američkog YouTubera Caseyja Neistata čijim konceptom 368<strong> </strong>smo u velikoj mjeri inspirisani.</p>
<p><strong>We're inspired by Casey Neistat's 368 concept, where he says: <i>The space is the most elusive thing.</i></strong><br/><br/>Ideja je jednostavna: pronaći veliki prostor, nabaviti gomilu opreme za kreativce, napraviti dio opreme koji im treba i pozvati ih da dođu. Ali, sve to i nije baš toliko jednostavno. <br/>Tad se odlučujemo za crowdfunding<strong> </strong>kampanju.</p>
<p><strong>The idea is quite simple: Find a big space, get a ton of equipment, and get creative people inside! Well, it sounds simple, but it's not.</strong></p>
<p><strong>That's why we've decided to create this crowdfunding campaign. </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562873624/b4cepy0nfzfqpjfkrlsg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Vjerujemo da crowdfunding ima puno veći smisao od <i>prikupljanja sredstava.</i> Vjerujemo da je rad zajednice najefikasniji za pozitivnu promjenu u društvu.<br/>Creative Space Sarajevo je projekat namijenjen zajednici. Vizija je da svaki pojedinac ostavi trag u kreiranju pozitivne promjene u gradu Sarajevu, a i životima kreativaca - jer će im zasigurno ponuditi dosta toga vrijednog za njihov napredak.</p>
<p><strong>We went with crowdfunding because we believe that the work of the community is the most effective and natural way of making a positive change in our society. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Our whole dream, our passion, our idea for Creative Space Sarajevo revolves around the community. Our vision revolves around giving every individual creator a chance to create their piece of positive change for Sarajevo, and of course, their professional careers as well. A project like this coming to life will surely go a long way for everyone making progress in their professional growth.</strong><br/><br/>Konceptualno je Space samoodrživi projekat (više informacija ispod), te je iz tog razloga vrijedan podrške uz misiju za otvaranje novih radnih mjesta, ali isto tako i doprinos kreatorima da uz neke mogućnosti koje ćemo pružati proširuju svoja znanja i samim tim postaju uspješniji u svojim poslovima.<br/>Pored toga, svjesni situacije u kojoj se naše društvo nalazi, smo željeli na ovaj način pokazati kolika je zapravo potreba za Creative Spaceom u Sarajevu, u nadi da ćemo tokom našeg puta naići i na razumijevanje lokalne uprave.</p>
<p><strong>Conceptually, this is a self-sustaining project (more info below), and that's also part of the reason why it's worth supporting it. Besides giving every creator a real chance to learn new things and progress in their work, our mission is also to create new jobs. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We're also using this opportunity to show just how much a project like this is needed in Sarajevo, and we hope that we'll find support from the local government along the way.</strong></p>
<p><br/>I na kraju, vjerujemo da je ideja  (koju je zajednica u manje od 24 sata nakon što je objavljen naš Instagram profil <strong>@creativespacesarajevo </strong>podržala u ogromnoj količini - na stotine poruka podrške, prijedloga, savjeta i partnerstava je ostvareno) zrela za ovakvu vrstu kampanje.<br/><br/>Mi kreativci stalno sharujemo radove jedni drugih, podržavamo se i zbog toga će slogan Creative Spacea biti: WE RISE BY LIFTING OTHERS.</p>
<p><strong>We genuinely believe that this idea is more than deserving for this type of campaign. The community vouched for that themselves; we've received a massive amount of comments, shares, and all kinds of support 24hrs after sharing our idea on creativespacesarajevo's Instagram profile.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creative people always support each other by helping promote and share our work, and hence, our slogan will be:</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Creative Space Sarajevo je zamišljen kao samoodrživi community centar<br/>koji se nalazi unutar višenamjenskog prostora osmišljenog <i>od kreatora za kreatore</i>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Creative Space Sarajevo was designed as a self-sustaining community center located inside a multipurpose space, designed by creators, for creators.</strong></p>
<p>Svi su dobrodošli, namijenjen je svima i moguće je da apsolutno svi koriste sadržaje.<br/>Sve vrste kreatora, u bilo kojoj branši poslovanja, onih koji tek počinju, oni koji već imaju uspješne karijere, oni koji su u posjeti Sarajevu - pa im treba prostor za montažu, upload, ili bilo šta drugo.</p>
<p><strong>We want to make this for everyone, and all will be welcome to use all of the center's content. All types of creators, no matter the industry, skill level, experience, successful entrepreneurs, or amateurs. Even those merely visiting Sarajevo and need a place to edit a clip or upload a file, when we say everyone – we mean it!</strong></p>
<p>Pošto je cijeli projekat osmišljen tako da bi bio samoodrživ unutar Creative Spacea će u lounge zoni postojati coffee shop, food corner, itd. Pored toga radićemo na redovnim sedmičnim i mjesečnim eventima, radionicama, konferencijama, festivalima, promocijama i slično. I takodjer, ćemo imati i coworking prostor - gdje ćete moći putem članarine imati svoj radni sto i ormarić kojem samo vi pristupate kada ste u Creative Spaceu.</p>
<p><strong>Creative Space Sarajevo will be designed into multiple areas. We'll have a place where we'll meet for weekly, monthly events, workshops, festivals, promos, etc. Then we'll have a coworking space where everyone will be able to get their very own work desk and cabinet on a membership plan. We'll also have a lounge area (of course) with things like a food corner and a coffee shop. </strong></p>

<p>Lounge Space je zamišljen kao prostor u kojem mogu boraviti svi posjetioci Creative Spacea.<br/>Funkcionisao bi u self-service principu: dakle, na šanku preuzmete svoje piće i sjednete gdje god vam odgovara.<br/><br/>Ono što smatramo da je važno napomenuti jeste da planiramo da budu dostupni isključivo #387 proizvodi. Pored toga, nećemo u posluživanju koristiti single-use plastiku. <br/><br/>Ispod je par primjera kako bi mi voljeli da to izgleda. Updateovat ćemo fotografije, kada kompletiramo dizajn interijera.</p>
<p><strong>We've imagined the Lounge Space as an area where everyone can come sit down, grab a cup of coffee from the bar and relax. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We're also very excited to use this opportunity to offer only #387 products; no single-use plastic will be used!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Free Space is one of the areas that's meant for workshops, promos, presentations, etc. In other words, we'll be able to quickly transform this area into anything that we need at that time.

<p>Coworking space je prostor u koji svakodnevno možeš odlaziti, sjediti za stolom ili ""zavaljen"" u lazy bag, biti okružen ljudima sličnih ambicija i raditi. Istina je da podsjeća na rad kod kuće, ali rad u coworking prostoru efikasniji, stvara strukturu u vašem životu, unaprijedjuje networking, i daje druge efekte.<br/><br/>Coworking zona unutar Creative Spacea Sarajevo će biti jedan od njegovih komercijalnih strana. Ono što svakako možemo garantovati je da će biti pristupačan svima.</p>

<p><strong>Coworking Space is an area where you can come and go daily, sit down at a desk, or throw yourself in one of the lazy bags. This is where you can surround yourself with creative, ambitious people and work. It's something like working from home, but since it's not home – coming here will help you get a sense of structure in your life, you'll be able to network, be more efficient, and otherwise improve. </strong></p>
<p><strong>This is one of the commercial areas of Creative Space, but we guarantee it'll be more than affordable to absolutely everyone!</strong></p>

<p>Studijski prostor je bila pokretačka misija cijelog projekta. <br/>Zamišljeno je da u prvobitnoj fazi postoji fotografski studio, sa nekoliko fotografskih pozadina i opremljen rasvjetom, te podcast studio sa nekoliko snimača zvuka i gluhom sobom.<br/><br/>S obzirom na fazu u kojoj se sad nalazimo, vjerujemo da ćemo moći proširiti to i na green key i white cikloramu, product photography studio, pa čak i streaming rooms, te kuhinja za food bloggere.</p>
<p>Studio Space je radni prostor. Dostupan svima, uz najave i rezervacije hourly-based termina. Prednost će, radi našeg poslovanja, morati imati korisnici coworking spacea, odnosno postojat će dnevni termini koji su dostupni svima, kao i termini za korisnike coworking spacea.</p>
<p>Uz potencijalne partnere će biti omogućen i GEAR LOCKER - ormarić sa opremom dostupnom za korištenje unutar Creative Spacea.</p>
<p><strong>Studio Space was the original idea behind the whole project. In its initial stage, we see it as a photography studio with a few backgrounds, lightning, and as a podcast studio with a couple of sound recorders and a deaf room.</strong></p>
<p><strong>But that's just the beginning. After getting here, we'll want to expand and offer things like green key, white cyclorama, product photography, and even streaming rooms and a kitchen-room for food bloggers!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Studio Space is a work area. Available to everyone through reservations on an hourly basis. Coworking Space users will have to have an advantage due to our business and progress; there'll be daily schedules that are available for everyone, as well as a schedule for Coworking Space users. </strong></p>
<p><strong>With potential partners, we'll be able to offer GEAR LOCKERS, a cabinet with equipment for use inside Creative Space.</strong></p>

</div></div>","For the English, look at the BOLD.

Pokreće nas to da ono što obično nedostaje nisu nove ideje, nego volja da se one realizuju. Mnogi mladi umjetnici ,fotografi, dizajneri, filmmakeri,...  - kreatori općenito, i čak starije kolege imaju potrebu za prostorom u kojem mogu udobno boraviti, družiti se, upoznavati nove ljude, prezentovati svoj rad, održati radionicu, prisustvovati radionici, naučiti nove stvari i ostvarivati saradnje.
We're driven by our collective will to create, to realize an idea, have it come to life, not just to have one. 
A plethora of young artists, photographers, designers, and generally creative people, no matter their age, need such a space where they can feel comfortable, feel welcome so that they can meet new people, socialize, share ideas, host workshops, presentations. They need a chance for a fresh perspective, a fresh set of eyes on their creations, and a place where they can learn new things and a chance for new opportunities.
Prostor je najneuhvatljivija stvar je rečenica američkog YouTubera Caseyja Neistata čijim konceptom 368 smo u velikoj mjeri inspirisani.
We're inspired by Casey Neistat's 368 concept, where he says: The space is the most elusive thing.Ideja je jednostavna: pronaći veliki prostor, nabaviti gomilu opreme za kreativce, napraviti dio opreme koji im treba i pozvati ih da dođu. Ali, sve to i nije baš toliko jednostavno. Tad se odlučujemo za crowdfunding kampanju.
The idea is quite simple: Find a big space, get a ton of equipment, and get creative people inside! Well, it sounds simple, but it's not.
That's why we've decided to create this crowdfunding campaign. 

Vjerujemo da crowdfunding ima puno veći smisao od prikupljanja sredstava. Vjerujemo da je rad zajednice najefikasniji za pozitivnu promjenu u društvu.Creative Space Sarajevo je projekat namijenjen zajednici. Vizija je da svaki pojedinac ostavi trag u kreiranju pozitivne promjene u gradu Sarajevu, a i životima kreativaca - jer će im zasigurno ponuditi dosta toga vrijednog za njihov napredak.
We went with crowdfunding because we believe that the work of the community is the most effective and natural way of making a positive change in our society. 
Our whole dream, our passion, our idea for Creative Space Sarajevo revolves around the community. Our vision revolves around giving every individual creator a chance to create their piece of positive change for Sarajevo, and of course, their professional careers as well. A project like this coming to life will surely go a long way for everyone making progress in their professional growth.Konceptualno je Space samoodrživi projekat (više informacija ispod), te je iz tog razloga vrijedan podrške uz misiju za otvaranje novih radnih mjesta, ali isto tako i doprinos kreatorima da uz neke mogućnosti koje ćemo pružati proširuju svoja znanja i samim tim postaju uspješniji u svojim poslovima.Pored toga, svjesni situacije u kojoj se naše društvo nalazi, smo željeli na ovaj način pokazati kolika je zapravo potreba za Creative Spaceom u Sarajevu, u nadi da ćemo tokom našeg puta naići i na razumijevanje lokalne uprave.
Conceptually, this is a self-sustaining project (more info below), and that's also part of the reason why it's worth supporting it. Besides giving every creator a real chance to learn new things and progress in their work, our mission is also to create new jobs. 
We're also using this opportunity to show just how much a project like this is needed in Sarajevo, and we hope that we'll find support from the local government along the way.
I na kraju, vjerujemo da je ideja  (koju je zajednica u manje od 24 sata nakon što je objavljen naš Instagram profil @creativespacesarajevo podržala u ogromnoj količini - na stotine poruka podrške, prijedloga, savjeta i partnerstava je ostvareno) zrela za ovakvu vrstu kampanje.Mi kreativci stalno sharujemo radove jedni drugih, podržavamo se i zbog toga će slogan Creative Spacea biti: WE RISE BY LIFTING OTHERS.
We genuinely believe that this idea is more than deserving for this type of campaign. The community vouched for that themselves; we've received a massive amount of comments, shares, and all kinds of support 24hrs after sharing our idea on creativespacesarajevo's Instagram profile.
Creative people always support each other by helping promote and share our work, and hence, our slogan will be:


Creative Space Sarajevo je zamišljen kao samoodrživi community centarkoji se nalazi unutar višenamjenskog prostora osmišljenog od kreatora za kreatore.
Creative Space Sarajevo was designed as a self-sustaining community center located inside a multipurpose space, designed by creators, for creators.
Svi su dobrodošli, namijenjen je svima i moguće je da apsolutno svi koriste sadržaje.Sve vrste kreatora, u bilo kojoj branši poslovanja, onih koji tek počinju, oni koji već imaju uspješne karijere, oni koji su u posjeti Sarajevu - pa im treba prostor za montažu, upload, ili bilo šta drugo.
We want to make this for everyone, and all will be welcome to use all of the center's content. All types of creators, no matter the industry, skill level, experience, successful entrepreneurs, or amateurs. Even those merely visiting Sarajevo and need a place to edit a clip or upload a file, when we say everyone – we mean it!
Pošto je cijeli projekat osmišljen tako da bi bio samoodrživ unutar Creative Spacea će u lounge zoni postojati coffee shop, food corner, itd. Pored toga radićemo na redovnim sedmičnim i mjesečnim eventima, radionicama, konferencijama, festivalima, promocijama i slično. I takodjer, ćemo imati i coworking prostor - gdje ćete moći putem članarine imati svoj radni sto i ormarić kojem samo vi pristupate kada ste u Creative Spaceu.
Creative Space Sarajevo will be designed into multiple areas. We'll have a place where we'll meet for weekly, monthly events, workshops, festivals, promos, etc. Then we'll have a coworking space where everyone will be able to get their very own work desk and cabinet on a membership plan. We'll also have a lounge area (of course) with things like a food corner and a coffee shop. 

Lounge Space je zamišljen kao prostor u kojem mogu boraviti svi posjetioci Creative Spacea.Funkcionisao bi u self-service principu: dakle, na šanku preuzmete svoje piće i sjednete gdje god vam odgovara.Ono što smatramo da je važno napomenuti jeste da planiramo da budu dostupni isključivo #387 proizvodi. Pored toga, nećemo u posluživanju koristiti single-use plastiku. Ispod je par primjera kako bi mi voljeli da to izgleda. Updateovat ćemo fotografije, kada kompletiramo dizajn interijera.
We've imagined the Lounge Space as an area where everyone can come sit down, grab a cup of coffee from the bar and relax. 
We're also very excited to use this opportunity to offer only #387 products; no single-use plastic will be used!
Take a look at some of our concept ideas below; we'll update the images once we complete our interior design.




 

Free Space je slobodni prostor namijenjen radionicama, promocijama, projekcijama, prezentacijama i slično. Dakle prostor koji će biti moguće transformisati u bilo koju navedenu svrhu u veoma kratkom roku. I ukoliko bude potrebno širenje njegovih kapaciteta u kontekstu broja osoba, uvijek će biti dostupno korištenje i dijelova lounge spacea.Naša zamisao je da izgleda ovako.
Free Space is one of the areas that's meant for workshops, promos, presentations, etc. In other words, we'll be able to quickly transform this area into anything that we need at that time. Even if we need to expand its capacity, our design will allow for a part of the Lounge Space to be used instead.
This is how we see it.



 

Coworking space je prostor u koji svakodnevno možeš odlaziti, sjediti za stolom ili ""zavaljen"" u lazy bag, biti okružen ljudima sličnih ambicija i raditi. Istina je da podsjeća na rad kod kuće, ali rad u coworking prostoru efikasniji, stvara strukturu u vašem životu, unaprijedjuje networking, i daje druge efekte.Coworking zona unutar Creative Spacea Sarajevo će biti jedan od njegovih komercijalnih strana. Ono što svakako možemo garantovati je da će biti pristupačan svima.
On bi trebao izgledati ovako.
Coworking Space is an area where you can come and go daily, sit down at a desk, or throw yourself in one of the lazy bags. This is where you can surround yourself with creative, ambitious people and work. It's something like working from home, but since it's not home – coming here will help you get a sense of structure in your life, you'll be able to network, be more efficient, and otherwise improve. 
This is one of the commercial areas of Creative Space, but we guarantee it'll be more than affordable to absolutely everyone!
This is how we see it.


 

Studijski prostor je bila pokretačka misija cijelog projekta. Zamišljeno je da u prvobitnoj fazi postoji fotografski studio, sa nekoliko fotografskih pozadina i opremljen rasvjetom, te podcast studio sa nekoliko snimača zvuka i gluhom sobom.S obzirom na fazu u kojoj se sad nalazimo, vjerujemo da ćemo moći proširiti to i na green key i white cikloramu, product photography studio, pa čak i streaming rooms, te kuhinja za food bloggere.
Studio Space je radni prostor. Dostupan svima, uz najave i rezervacije hourly-based termina. Prednost će, radi našeg poslovanja, morati imati korisnici coworking spacea, odnosno postojat će dnevni termini koji su dostupni svima, kao i termini za korisnike coworking spacea.
Uz potencijalne partnere će biti omogućen i GEAR LOCKER - ormarić sa opremom dostupnom za korištenje unutar Creative Spacea.
Studio Space was the original idea behind the whole project. In its initial stage, we see it as a photography studio with a few backgrounds, lightning, and as a podcast studio with a couple of sound recorders and a deaf room.
But that's just the beginning. After getting here, we'll want to expand and offer things like green key, white cyclorama, product photography, and even streaming rooms and a kitchen-room for food bloggers!
Studio Space is a work area. Available to everyone through reservations on an hourly basis. Coworking Space users will have to have an advantage due to our business and progress; there'll be daily schedules that are available for everyone, as well as a schedule for Coworking Space users. 
With potential partners, we'll be able to offer GEAR LOCKERS, a cabinet with equipment for use inside Creative Space.

<p><u><strong>Who we are:</strong></u></p>
<p>  Hello, Bonjour, مرحبا. We are Soulef (from Tunisia) and Meggie (from China), we want to build a nursery school for children from 5 to 10 years old in a community of Tunis, the capital city of Tunisia. Nowadays, more and more Tunisian parents have been occupied with their work and even don’t have time to accompany and take care of their children. We try to establish this small but cozy nursery school to take care and tutor kids to ensure that they are growing up healthily and happily.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Why we aim to do that:</strong></u></p>
<p>  On the one hand, we want to help those Tunisian children to receive responsible and suitable growing-up guidance and assist in reducing the burdens on children’s parents. The community in Tunis urgently needs a trustworthy and professional nursery school.</p>
<p>  On the other hand, we want to buy a cozy apartment for Soulef’s two sons after years’ of good operation. Soulef Hadj Brahim, a single mom, wants to spare no efforts to buy a cozy apartment for her two kids one day to stop keeping renting and moving house. Soulef has been an excellent Arabic teacher for more than thirteen years, whose students range from small kids to old people. What’s more, she is proficient in Arabic, French, and English.</p>
<p>  Every children deserves to have a cozy home, in which there are families, hot water, clean bed, and table, in which they don’t have to worry about one day they have to pick up their luggage and move their house again, in which they can plant flowers with their mom freely, in which they can invite their friends to come and play together. Children’s dream is mom’s dream, and also dreams for all of us.</p>
<p>     </p>
<p><u><strong>What we do:</strong></u></p>
<p>  For the school daycare:</p>
<ul>
<li>We take care of primary pupils between 5 and 10 years</li>
<li>Children can receive super daycare and supervision after school</li>
<li>Children can get extra tutorial guidance</li>
<li>Children have chances to go to clubs: theaters, art museums, culture activities</li>
<li>Children ‘s interest and schedules will be tracked and followed as they are with their parents</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need <strong>$9999</strong> to launch our project, the money we raise from the platform we go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first three months renting fee for the nursery</li>
<li>Layout and renovation fee (including safety facilities)</li>
<li>Children’s products procurement: toys, textbooks, tableware</li>
<li>Teacher’s salary for the first month</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We promise we will invest all the money we raise into this project, during the preparation time, you can see our expenditure details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently, we are starting our project from finding a good location. Come and join us to witness our progress! Starting a new business is risky and exhausting, but every moment when we think about children’s big smile, we forget all the pain and keep moving forward.</p>
<p>We thank you for your support and prepare some small perks for you</p>
<p><strong>Can't donate? You can still help!</strong></p>
<p>Please share this campaign! You can use the Indiegogo share tools to share it to others. One of the best things you can do is help connect us with others, and we'd be so grateful if you<strong> share this on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, email, or wherever else you reach people</strong>! <strong>Thank you in advance!</strong></p>

<h3>Our story</h3>
<p>My name is Clever Mukori and i'm the Founder of Learn Or Teach. I am an immigrant from Zimbabwe and I came to the United States in 2012. In 2017, I graduated from Concordia College in Moorhead, MN and went on to start Learn Or Teach the following year. </p>
<p>Learn Or Teach is a corporate learning company that specializes in custom course creation and hosting services. We provide a learning management system on which organizations can create and host online courses, for employee, partner, and even customer training.</p>
<p>Given the disruption wreaked by the Corona virus in the past few weeks, demand for our services has skyrocketed as organizations of all shapes and sizes resort to remote work to maintain productivity. While current solutions on the market are fragmented, we eliminate the need to hire an instructional designer, a graphic designer, a videographer, a content editor, and learning management system services separately. We are a one stop solution that thereby lowers the barrier to entry for small and mid-sized businesses</p>
<p>We need your help expanding our course creation equipment to address the sudden spike in demand for custom online course creation. Previously we had been renting equipment and it is proving to be too expensive to do and not a sensible alternative given the demand we are facing at present.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Here Is A Sample Of Our Work To Date</h3>
<p>This customer had a construction safety training company. We created online courses for them from print material and recorded in person training sessions that were converted into online video learning content.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Analysts estimate that total losses due to the corona virus will eclipse 4 trillion dollars in revenue, which translates to nearly<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> 80 million jobs in the US economy being at high or moderate risk, as per Moody's Analytics. That's more than half of the 153 million jobs in the economy overall.</span></p>
<p>While all these jobs may not necessarily be lost, it's probable that as many as 10 million of those workers could see some impact to their paychecks -- either layoffs, furloughs, fewer hours or wage cuts.</p>
<p>Your support will enable us to provide small and mid-sized business across the nation with a low cost alternative for digitizing their training to either utilize this downtime to upskill their workforce or transition their employees to working remotely.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is a probability that we may not reach our intended fundraising goal. If that is the case, we will buy the equipment we can with the amount raised, and continue to supplement it with our internal funds as we go. Your support would enable us to serve more customers more quickly.</p>
<p>As the restrictions continue, the demand could even increase further, in which case we would use the funds raised from other work to purchase more equipment.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>First, we would like you help spread the word to other small businesses that you think could benefit from our services. Second, we would like you to support and share our campaign via email and with your followers on social media, perhaps they would know someone in need. Thank you for helping up support small and mid-sized businesses redefine how they learn.</p>

We are striving to open a hookah lounge in River Market. River Market is a densely packed neighborhood with old historic buildings and the charm and character that comes with it, it is less than a quarter of a square mile and anchored by the largest farmers market in KC and the Steamboat Arabia Museum. We see this neighborhood as a vital part of the KC experience, and we want to be a part of this. Currently we have the light rail scheduled to go live in summer of 2016 which runs a 2 mile course, starting at one end at Union Station, then Crossroads, Downtown, and finally ending in the heart of River Market. River Market is going to be greatly benefited by this light rail as there will be a diaspora of residents from other neighborhoods able to travel to this neighborhood without having to get in their car and drive, plus residents in this neighborhood will benefit from an increase in walkability in the general area as more and more businesses have opened due to the light rail. This neighborhood is becoming more of the livable neighborhood that residents need and want... there is a plethora of restaurants and shopping, as well as service retailers at the fingertips of residents but we found that there are few entertainment destinations and no hookah lounges in this neighborhood. People need places to unwind, socialize, and just have a good time. We aim to provide customers with the highest quality hookah experience possible and fill a need and want in this neighborhood. Our concept consists of the following:</p><p>*We are going to be half coffee shop, half hookah lounge. We plan to locally source our coffee blends from The Roasterie, a Kansas City icon. Our teas are going to be flavorful whole leaf, organic in flavors such as Jasmine, Green Tea, and Chai. We will have a large array of high quality food products and drink products for every palate.</p><p>*Our hookahs will be top of the line glass and stainless steel hookahs which eliminate a chemical taste and offer the purest and smoothest smoke possible. With our glass hookahs we will offer fruit infusions that offer a visual display that complements the flavor of the tobacco. Everything from the natural coals, premium shisha, top of the line hookahs, the way we expertly prepare your hookah is done to ensure you have the highest quality smoking experience. </p><p>*We will offer a large variety of flavors from a number of premium tobacco companies such as Fumari, Starbuzz, and Hookafina, there will be a flavor for everyone. </p><p>*Free WiFi and a casual and comfortable interior with soothing qualities will make our customers feel like they can unwind and let the worries of their day melt away.</p><p>*Hookah has been a social activity for hundreds of years and we want to stay true to that tradition, we will makes sure our music is chill yet compelling, and never too loud or the kind you would dance to at a club. Monthly events will offer chances to network, make new friends, and enjoy new flavors.</p><p>*Excellent customer service is another very important pillar of our concept. There is nothing like entering a place that truly cares about what you want. Whether our customers use our spot to study, socialize, or network, we will be there to make sure that they are happy with their experience. A friendly smile, attentive staff, a willingness to go the extra mile and keep up with what our customers wants is the cornerstone to our customer service. When you leave our lounge we want you to see us as the best and only option for hookah in KC!</p></div>","Kansas City has seen incredible growth in the last several years, especially in historical neighborhoods like the Crossroads, River Market, and Downtown.

<h2>4. Current Situation</h2>
<p>Because we are students, we did not have enough funds to be rented Kanji House by a main street. Currently Kanji House is situated by a side road which is not easy to be found by passersby.  </p>
<p>Nor we are not able to afford for advertising costs. Currently we only rely on Tripadviser. Unfortunately, the average visitors are around three people a day. Either we find someone on main streets nearby or people who found us by Tripadvisor visited Kanji House. </p>
<p>It is hard to keep Kanji House with only three visitors a day. With this situation, it is difficult to not only expand but also even continue to open Kanji House. One day we will graduate our university. Under this tough situation, we will not be able to become full time workers as Kanji House does not make any profit at this stage. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<div>
<h2>5. Why we need your help and support</h2>
<p>We need your support to keep our Kanji House open. Our main purpose of this fundraising is for Kanji House advertising and our website service to increase visitors and customers.</p>
<p>Although Kanji House got the number one ranking of Asakusa area of TripAdviser, daily visitors are only three as we said. We would like to more people to know and visit Kanji House to feel traditional Japanese world. Please read comments from TripAdviser so that you can find our passion.</p>

1. Who we are
We are a university student group in Japan. Members who share the same view set up Kanji House to introduce Japanese traditional culture to people from all over the world. 2.  Our vision
We aim to introduce Japanese traditional culture widely.
We aim to reduce conflicts between people from other culture or background by communication with and understanding.
We aim to establish network all over the world by using Kanji House as a hub.

3.  Our Activities  -What is Kanji House?
Kanji House is a place to achieve our vision. Currently you can have an experience to enjoy traditional Japan. 
Kanji House is situated in Asakusa, Tokyo, Japan. Asakusa is well known as an area which retains Japanese tradition and culture as well as a sightseeing area that 40,000,000 people visit every year. 
At Kanji House we will create your Kanji name based on what you tell us such as your personality. Then we will write your Kanji name in Japanese calligraphy. 
Kanji House staff wearing Kimono, Japanese traditional costume will welcome you in a room decorated in Japanese traditional style. Our specially trained concierge will translate your name into Kanji name, then write it in Shodo (Japanese calligraphy), for you to take home!




a). Our unique method how to create Kanji name.
You will tell us about yourself such as your personality, hobbies etc. We will create your Kanji name based on what you tell us. Kanji (Chinese characters) have a lots of meanings. 




For example  Michael, whose name is pronounced ""maikl,"" likes dancing will give us an image that “he is living with bright and glamorous world.  He has a free spirit,” and as an extra information, “he is living near the river.” So we created his Kanji name as below.  


b). Shodo calligrapher Kanji Artist 
What is the Shodo? Please see this.c).Hand in Kanji name we create for you
We will give you a piece of paper that explains meaning about Kanji characters used for your name.








Kakejiku (Hanging scroll)   SmallKakejiku (Hanging scroll)  Larged). Picture frames and Furoshiki to purchase at Kanji House.
Furoshiki is Japanese traditional clothes for wrapping. You can use Furoshiki as many as you like not like wrapping paper. Furoshiki is eco-friendly culture that Japan can be proud of. You can wrap any kind of shape object by Furoshiki.

e). Kompeito for a souvenir at Kanji House!
Kompeito is one of the most popular souvenirs in Asakusa. Kompeito is Japanese traditional candies which you can purchase only in Japan. They are very beautiful and looks elegant because of their colorful looks. 
You can eat or put a pinch of it into champagne or sparkling wine. Kompeito into the drinks is perfectly matched and the taste is slightly sweet, so it's very tasty. We promise you will be popular if you bring Kompeito to a party.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Our biggest risk at hand is not having enough football teams to participate.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Summary</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We are Cool Cup Smoothies!</h3>
<p>I’m the owner/operator born and raised in Indianapolis, IN known as the crossroads of America. I’ve spent my life in some form or fashion in service to others. In retail, customer service, or in the corporate sector for almost 20 years I’ve honed my business skills. As a company we’re committed to increasing opportunities for all people especially those in under served low income areas to have access to healthy food options which has always been a dream of mine.</p>
<p>This is where I need your support!</p>
<p>Through Indiegogo, we hope to raise all of our startup costs to ensure we have a solid foundation and the tools we need to begin a successful operation. We plan on working hard and just as importantly, being smart about how we use our time.

<p>Our location will be located on the eastern part of Indianapolis which is a hot bed for unhealthy eating establishments. The next closest true competitor is over 10 miles away. I don’t believe a person with low income should have to travel miles and miles away to enjoy healthy food. Even grocers such as Whole Foods, Fresh Thyme, or Trader Joe;s are nowhere to be found.  This area is home to over 135,000 people just within a 5 mile radius with shopping centers, movie theaters, and countless businesses that see daily traffic.

</div></div>","Summary
We are Cool Cup Smoothies!
I’m the owner/operator born and raised in Indianapolis, IN known as the crossroads of America. I’ve spent my life in some form or fashion in service to others. In retail, customer service, or in the corporate sector for almost 20 years I’ve honed my business skills. As a company we’re committed to increasing opportunities for all people especially those in under served low income areas to have access to healthy food options which has always been a dream of mine.
This is where I need your support!
Through Indiegogo, we hope to raise all of our startup costs to ensure we have a solid foundation and the tools we need to begin a successful operation. We plan on working hard and just as importantly, being smart about how we use our time. Many of our startup costs are tools that will make our work more efficient, including a Blend Tec blenders, refrigeration and freezing equipment, store construction, supplies, and product. We also have costs in order to grow the business with a marketing campaign. Our goal is $50,000 which will help us meet our financial needs. Below is a complete breakdown of where your financial support will go to.

What We Need & What You Get

Note. Not a single dollar of your contributions will go towards wages or any personal financial support. We strongly believe in the product and our business model will provide the necessary revenue to support the staffing costs.
We have some great perks available to thank you for your contribution to our campaign. Everyone who donates $25 or more will receive a pair of Cool Cup Smoothies shades just like ""SMOOVE"" our mascot wears and a social media thank you. Additional perks and chance at creating and naming a new menu item, t-shirts, having a cool cup character created in your likeness, and a collectible blending cup with our logo, and some top shelf type perks as well. Supporting our campaign also gives you bragging rights forever - the chance to say “you were there when they got started.”  And most importantly, your contribution is a chance to feel great about the fact that you are making a real difference in the lives of many people and helping the American dream come true.
In the event that we do not meet our goal we can assure you that the funds will still be used to pursue the business.

We'll continue to make sure our suppliers and wholesalers provide us with quality products at the best rate.

We'll definitely be getting our hands dirty with building and painting ourselves along with the help of volunteers.  None of your contributions will used in vain and every dollar counts. 
So what's the plan?

<p><b>Our History</b></p>
<p>Hello, we are two sisters, Dellyr and Johana, when we finished the university, we wanted to be entrepreneurs and to serve the society, we wanted to create something big, that would move the world, that makes people happy in a fun and mindful direction.</p>
<p>We started differents kind of businesses. The first one was to sell yogurths, the second was  a hairdressing saloon, the third was a supermarket, the fourth was to sell clothes, but didn't go successful, we lost money, but we learned a lot.</p>
<p>After all, three years ago, we started to rent an apartment in airbnb, the business was great, but we wanted to create a model business with focus on wellness, so, we decided to start a wellness hotel in Cartagena. We used the canvas model and we did the business plan, next, we got the money (savings and loans), and, after several months, the Hotel was ready to operate (June of 2018) , it has been amazing. Dellyr is the manager's Hotel and Johana helps with networks and marketing.</p>
<p>And so, here we are today, working from our Hotel day after day. We've hired an amazing staff that we consider one family. We're ready to grow and to the next level.</p>
<p><strong>The hotel</strong></p>
<p>Our Hotel has a basic equipment and we hope to have a wellness Hotel with all what is required, so, we want to have a swimmingpool, improve our rooms, have new rooms and above all, we want to have a beautiful, equipped, comfortable and nice spa. It is very important for us because Múcura Hotel &amp; Spa is the expression of the things that we want to do, to make people happy and to contribute with a better world.</p>
<p><strong>Funding goals</strong></p>
<p>$20,000 we celebrate because the most beautiful place in the Hotel will be the Spa, at last, we  will have a swimmingpool  (that is very important for a Hotel in Cartagena) and we would equip the current rooms in the best possible way.</p>
<p>More of $20.000 will be amazing  an update on what all your generosity will mean for the growth of Múcura Hotel &amp; Spa.</p>
<p>Less of $20.000 is an enormous opportunity to organize our Spa and to improve some of our current rooms.</p>
<p>We hope you join our story and collect on some of our awesome rewards!</p>

</div></div>","Our History
Hello, we are two sisters, Dellyr and Johana, when we finished the university, we wanted to be entrepreneurs and to serve the society, we wanted to create something big, that would move the world, that makes people happy in a fun and mindful direction.
We started differents kind of businesses. The first one was to sell yogurths, the second was  a hairdressing saloon, the third was a supermarket, the fourth was to sell clothes, but didn't go successful, we lost money, but we learned a lot.
After all, three years ago, we started to rent an apartment in airbnb, the business was great, but we wanted to create a model business with focus on wellness, so, we decided to start a wellness hotel in Cartagena. We used the canvas model and we did the business plan, next, we got the money (savings and loans), and, after several months, the Hotel was ready to operate (June of 2018) , it has been amazing. Dellyr is the manager's Hotel and Johana helps with networks and marketing.
And so, here we are today, working from our Hotel day after day. We've hired an amazing staff that we consider one family. We're ready to grow and to the next level.
The hotel
Our Hotel has a basic equipment and we hope to have a wellness Hotel with all what is required, so, we want to have a swimmingpool, improve our rooms, have new rooms and above all, we want to have a beautiful, equipped, comfortable and nice spa. It is very important for us because Múcura Hotel & Spa is the expression of the things that we want to do, to make people happy and to contribute with a better world.
Funding goals
$20,000 we celebrate because the most beautiful place in the Hotel will be the Spa, at last, we  will have a swimmingpool  (that is very important for a Hotel in Cartagena) and we would equip the current rooms in the best possible way.
More of $20.000 will be amazing  an update on what all your generosity will mean for the growth of Múcura Hotel & Spa.
Less of $20.000 is an enormous opportunity to organize our Spa and to improve some of our current rooms.
We hope you join our story and collect on some of our awesome rewards!
The impact
To have a place where people could be happy, healthy and quiet is our gift to the world,  specially on these days, when life runs fast and escapes from us.
The business model of Múcura is focused on harmony, sustainability and equilibrium. It is so hard to achieve those goals, but, it is our proposal, we are working every day to our visitors finding peace, love, and care the live in all its expressions. 
Risk and challenges

We are optimistic and we hope everything that is dreamt becomes reality, but of course, unexpected delays are a possibility.

<p>Hi, my name is Kevin Burgess and I am opening Laureate
Brewing Company in Iowa City where our self-proclaimed “Brewer Laureate” will
produce Distinguished Craft Beer served at our taproom, for carry-out or for
consumption at select bars and restaurants in the Iowa City area.</p>
<p>Our brewery aims to be unique in that its goal is to not
only produce high quality craft beer but also to create a sense of community
through craft beer.</p>
<p>You can expect the highest level of customer service at our brewery taproom.  We will be there to answer all
your questions and provide details on the ingredients used for the beer you are
consuming or thinking of trying next.  </p>
<p>We will be hosting beer education classes where those interested can learn more about craft beer - like how to
best serve craft beer for your private dining engagements or learn about the
subtle (or not so subtle) differences in taste and character when the brewer
chooses to use different yeasts, grain and hops! We will elevate the discussion
about beer.</p>
<p>Laureate Brewing will occupy a 2000 sq. ft. warehouse just
off of Gilbert St and Southgate Ave adjacent to the Iowa River bicycle trail
just south of downtown. </p>
<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>I’m running the IndieGoGo campaign to raise awareness that
we are opening this Fall/Winter but also I want to serve our beer right
away once we get our brewer's license.</p>
<p>I need help with some start-up costs to get things set:
legal fees, merchandise and the purchase of the taproom beer dispensing equipment...all to help speed
up the opening date and be able to serve our beer as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>To help guarantee our success, we will have multiple
community oriented funding and engagement opportunities to help with startup
and to grow the brewery, and those participants or “Founders” will receive
rewards from the brewery and also if interested, provide input in the beer we
produce and serve. We plan to brew many different types of craft beer from ""beginner"" to advanced ""beer geek"" and have at least 10 beers available at the
taproom as often as we can.</p>
<p>All our reward items will have the brewery logo, and are
made of high quality material. We have reward levels for everyone... There are
stickers, bottle opener key chains, can koozies, t-shirts, a hoodie, a trucker hat and a winter ski
cap. Also, we have the ""Iowa City Founder"" level which will entitle you to a Laureate Brewing pint glass and 15 fills at the taproom through 2016. The ""Hawkeye Founder"" level (amended slightly due to a typo on my part, see notes below) will entitle you to a Laureate Brewing stainless steel growler and growler fills through 2016 (15 fills). A very nice deal.  The brewery will open early on Hawkeye game days! Below are some of the perks available from Laureate Brewing -  more perk pics added soon!<br/></p>

<p>Help us spread the word that a new brewery is coming to Iowa
City. And if one of the rewards doesn’t fit, don’t worry, there will be lots of
future opportunities to help out once we’re open. For those who are really
motivated to help, please contact me directly, we have many opportunities
available for those wanting to help build and sustain a locally owned craft
brewery in Iowa City. </p>

It is important that this project will get support. It will be very handy for people like me and its sad that no solutions have been created for such problems before. But that is why I'm here doing this. I hope everyone will find their way of helping me help others. Thank you so much for reading and helping. Much appreciation.For any question message / email me.Donations would be accepted via PayPal as well: paypal.me/dankocohenI will update on every donation coming in on the updates section.

</h3>You want to know why you should contribute to our campaign or else you wouldn't be here now would you? Cool. We got this. Check it out.<br/><br/>Because Pita Jungle rocks! You know it! We know it! Sooo...We're getting the band back together!<br/><br/>And we want to bring you back so we can play all the classic hits for you whenever your generous, gorgeous little heart's desire!<br/><br/>$1.75 million dollars?! Are you kidding me? <br/><br/>This is a crazy idea! A crazy plan, isn't it? It's too grand to actually work, don't you think? <br/><br/>It's okay if you think that! We think so too! That's why we have to try!<br/> <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Appetizer<br/>
</h3>
<ul><li>Why $1.75 Million?</li></ul>
<p>Here's the deal. We have to, and we mean we HAVE TO have $1 million dollars in liquid capital in order to even be considered for the franchise. You're thinking that's a lot of (pita) bread! Yeah, we know!</p>
<ul><li>Where's the other $750,000 going?</li></ul>
<p>We're glad you asked. There's a lot going on, so let's hit the highlights.</p>
<p>First off, we're going to give all the employees who were laid off as a result of the closing, an invitation to return to work. Then we're going to give each of them a $2500 ""severance stipend"" because, losing a job sucks, this campaign is 60 days long, it's a long shot that this will actually work, there are no guarantees that any of us will land another job immediately, and we all have bills to pay. Besides, after getting only a 10 day notice, it's the right thing to do.<br/></p>
<p>It's going to cost around $650,000 for the franchise fees, the start-up costs, and the build-out of the new restaurant. This is from ground zero all the way to opening day. <br/></p>
<p>(We ain't goin' back to the same spot and having to deal with the same landlord that kicked us out because he wanted to practically double the rent! Sorry, not sorry!)<br/></p>
<p>This is a fixed funding campaign. That means that if we don't reach our goal, we get nothing. <br/></p>
<p>Why did we choose that? Good question, glad you asked. <br/></p>
<p>Here's the answer: <br/></p>
<p>Because we have no desire to take a lesser amount of money, because the facts are, this just won't work with anything less than $1.75 million. So we're not here to grab a few bucks and run off. We are seriously committed to making this a viable, wonderful addition to our community. We want the whole thing or nothing at all. We're all in.</p>
<p>Besides, this protects you, our community. If we don't raise the entire amount, you don't lose a single penny of your hard earned cash!<br/></p>
<p>Not convinced yet? Then let us show you the Main Course.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Entree<br/>
</h3>We have goals and dreams, just like you do. So we're going to implement some of those into what we think will make a better business, especially as it pertains to restaurants. This is a community, and through our existence as a business, we intend to make the community better as a whole, because you and everyone else knows that we're all in this together. Check this out!<br/><br/><ul><li>A better living wage!</li></ul>We are going to lead the way and be ahead of the curve of minimum wage by giving our employees something they can actually live on: $10/hour to start - before it's mandated by the state of California. Then we're going to increase that hourly rate, again, making sure that we're ahead of the curve set by the state! People deserve to make a decent wage, and we want to be at the forefront of that movement!<br/><br/><ul><li>Profit sharing for our employees!</li></ul>A better wage is great, but to us, that's not enough! We're also going to set up the restaurant so that we have a profit-sharing component for our employees. <br/><br/><p>Why? You really ask the best questions. Here's why:<br/></p>
<p>Have you ever been to a restaurant and had a bad server? Or maybe a moody one? Did it color your experience one way or another? Of course it did! <br/></p>
<p>We've been doing this a long time, and we know that <b><i>especially </i></b>in restaurants, our employees are the single most important factor as the face of the business. Our belief is simple. <br/></p>
<p>The more we share in the profits, the more our employees will care. The more the employees care, the better they will take care of you, our loyal customers. The better they take care of you and yours, the more you're going to want to support a place that feels like an extension of your own home. And that, friends, makes everybody happy, healthy and wise. It's just good business for everyone.<br/></p>
<ul><li>It's all GREEN!</li></ul>It's our intention to be the greenest restaurant in Pasadena! Whatever we can do, we'll do it. We are going to explore every possible avenue to be sure that we are doing everything we can to be kind to our community. That means being aware of and extremely careful with water consumption and waste, as we are in a severe drought state. That means leaving the smallest possible carbon footprint. <br/><br/>We want to partner with local farms for as much of our menu as we possibly can. So if you know one, or are one, and you want to have a conversation, then hit us up! But this whole endeavor, for us, is about sustainability. <br/><br/><p>We have no desire to take, take, take in the way that too many big businesses do. We want to foster, preserve and protect our community in the most sustainable way possible. It has to start somewhere, and it has to start with someone! We want to be the where and we want to be the someones. Is that a word? It doesn't matter, you get the point. <br/></p>
<p>Here's the bottom line: We want to give you the highest quality product, at the best price, while we stay conscientious about our environment and your health. What's good for one of us, can and should be good for all of us!<br/></p>
<ul><li>Food donations! <br/>
</li></ul>Do you have any idea how much food restaurants waste on a daily basis? We won't keep you in suspense: it's tons! Quite literally when you combine the myriad establishments in existence right now. <br/><br/>We say no more food waste! We will donate anything and everything we can to local charities. Food is too precious to waste, and there are far too many people who go hungry, and that's just not okay when we, as a country, throw so much of it in the garbage.<br/><br/>Who knows? Maybe we'll even start a new movement in Old Town Pasadena and change the whole landscape of how restaurants operate! Wouldn't that be awesome?<br/><br/><ul><li>What do I get?</li></ul>Okay, okay, easy tiger! We got you!<br/><br/>Our offer couldn't be any more simple. Ready? Here we go:<br/><br/>Every $1 given towards our campaign is worth $2 towards your favorite items on our delectable and beloved menu. So you double your spending power right off the bat! <br/><br/>We know times are tough, especially working that 9 to 5, hustling the kids to and from school, and sometimes, money is just a bit tight. Right? We know! That's why this campaign is being run so that you know we have YOU in mind too!<br/><br/>How it will work: <br/><br/>You give us money. We'll call that ""Step 1"".<br/><br/>We'll send you a voucher reflecting your contribution. That's ""Step 2"".<br/><br/>You bring that voucher in when we open the doors, and we'll give you a gift card worth DOUBLE what you gave us to get this thing up and running! ""Step 3"".<br/><br/>Got it? Cool! Get ya some!<br/><br/>What's the catch? <br/><br/>Only this: There will be a fair and reasonable daily cap per customer, and a separate, yet also fair and reasonable cap per catering order. <br/><br/>Why the cap? <br/><br/>Look, we're trying to be sustainable for the long-term. You and we, would both hate to see us have to close the doors because we were fiscally irresponsible! Seriously, it's not like we're going to let MC Hammer run the joint!<br/><br/>Here's a promise: the per customer cap will be more than enough for you to have lunch or dinner, and honestly, considering our price point, it will probably be enough for you and a date. Cool?<br/><br/>And as for the catering, you're still going to have plenty of food to feed the office at half the price! So your colleagues are still going to fight over who gets the last of the Jalapeno/Cilantro hummus. Breaking up office fights will still be on you though! We can't be getting involved in that nonsense!<br/><br/>In imposing a cap, it's our desire to encourage many donors in the community, and we want many of you to be able to take advantage of this awesome offer and not just leave it to a few. And also because we're sincerely focused on being both a community and a family friendly place, and we want to be here long term.<br/><br/>Speaking of family friendly, how this for something new?<br/><br/>Kids 12 and under eat free on Tuesdays! Yes we can do that! Why the heck not?<br/><br/>We're serious about integrating ourselves into the community in an positive way that gives back to those around us, because without you, we know we wouldn't survive. Like we said before, we know we're all in this together, and we intend to act accordingly! <br/><br/>Speaking of giving back!<br/><br/>Many of you know that we gave a 10% discount to local workers. Well, we're bringing that back too! But in an improved way! Ready for this?<br/><br/>Anyone will be able to sign up for our new loyalty program. Anyone! For every $10 you spend at the restaurant, we'll give you a buck back! That's a 10% reward program for anyone and everyone who wants to eat at our remarkable restaurant!<br/><br/>So get loyal! Get fed! Get some of that hard earned cash back! That's what community is all about!<br/><br/>

We think it's pretty damn cool what we're trying to do here too. <br/><br/>What if you don't live in Southern California? What if you'll never make it to Pasadena to try one of our amazing, perhaps life-changing, delicious Pita Sandwiches? What if you'll never be able to take advantage of this incredible offer to double your spending power?<br/><br/>Don't fret, friend! You can get still your warm and fuzzies on if you want to contribute!<br/><br/>Every month, until we pay it in full, we will cheerfully donate whatever dollar amount you contribute, in the form of food, to local charity should you not be able to claim that awesomeness for yourself. <br/><br/>And honestly, we really feel that that would be too bad for you, but you can still help! <br/><br/>You can help us to not only reach our goal, but you'll be helping by giving a meal to someone who really, really, really needs it. And we think that's pretty damn cool too! <br/><br/>That's it! That's our spiel! Welcome to the struggle, ya'll! Give us your money, then come git yer belly full! We'll see you when we open the doors!<br/>

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<div>-Entertainment and Theatre Publicity, Workshops and Events, Corporate Entertainment Production and more!-</div>
<h4>Our Purpose:</h4>
<div><ul>
<li>to support, promote and advance the arts in South Africa</li>

<li>to create awareness and increased coverage of the arts with the ultimate aim of expanding audiences</li>
<li>to increase and promote public conversation and engagement of the arts across all digital and traditional platforms</li>
</ul></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <ul> <li>We are looking to raise about R10 000 to help us with various marketing material (banners and a banner wall), a Facebook marketing allowance, to get our website designed and developed and up and running, to purchase basic office equipment that we've been living without (a good printer), and to have some Graphic Design work done for some upcoming events.</li>
<li>If we manage to raise more than our set out goal, this will go to more *wishlist* expenses and would be worked out as a longer term plan.

Onwards and Upwards.</li>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul> <li>We'd love it if you shared our campaign far and wide! On Facebook, other social media platforms, email, whatever! Share it with whoever might find value in our cause.</li> <li>If you have anything you or your company would like to donate or sponsor in particular (e.g. branded banner wall, or pull up banner, printing services, videography or animation services, promotional gifts etc) we would be happy to place your company's logo on sponsored items as well as marketing material.</li>
<li>If you or anyone you know would prefer to sponsor merchandise for an event (e.g. some Wine or refreshments for an event, or even prizes for events) We'd be happy to have your branding on show too.</li> </ul> </div> <p> If anyone has any questions or queries, please don't hesitate to contact us on info@foxindustriessa.co.za</p><p>:-)</p></div>","Fox Industries is an exciting new Entertainment Sector Company specialising in Workshops for Entertainment Industry Professionals, Corporate Entertainment Production, and small scale Theatre Publicity.

We are currently reaching out to friends, family and supporters of Fox Industries to help us reach our goals before our Official Launch at the end of June! The funds we are aiming to raise will make an immense difference in the successful running and launching of our company, as well as take a bit of the 'bootstrap' burden off trying to get a successful company off the ground.

Who We Are
-Entertainment and Theatre Publicity, Workshops and Events, Corporate Entertainment Production and more!-
Our Purpose:

to support, promote and advance the arts in South Africa
to upskill professionals in the Performing Arts and Entertainment Industry
to elevate standards and professionalism in the industry as a whole
to create awareness and increased coverage of the arts with the ultimate aim of expanding audiences
to increase and promote public conversation and engagement of the arts across all digital and traditional platforms
   What We Need   We are looking to raise about R10 000 to help us with various marketing material (banners and a banner wall), a Facebook marketing allowance, to get our website designed and developed and up and running, to purchase basic office equipment that we've been living without (a good printer), and to have some Graphic Design work done for some upcoming events.
If we manage to raise more than our set out goal, this will go to more *wishlist* expenses and would be worked out as a longer term plan. These include subscriptions to Powtoon, a Newclip Media Monitoring Redbook, investment into future events, and a possible launch. We have added a couple of perks for donating too, so please go check them out! If we do not reach our entire goal, the funds will be used for the higher priority things, like branding.    The Impact Any physical and monetary contributions would help Fox Industries get to the next level- out of the rut that often comes with bootstrapping a business.  It would allow us to increase the amount of Workshops on offer, increasing revenue. It would help us to increase social engagement around our brand, ultimately gaining more supporters and followers and therefore more clients. It would take an immense amount of stress off me and allow us to fully focus on building a brand and a company we believe in and are incredibly proud of. Onwards and Upwards.


    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  We'd love it if you shared our campaign far and wide! On Facebook, other social media platforms, email, whatever! Share it with whoever might find value in our cause. If you have anything you or your company would like to donate or sponsor in particular (e.g. branded banner wall, or pull up banner, printing services, videography or animation services, promotional gifts etc) we would be happy to place your company's logo on sponsored items as well as marketing material.
If you or anyone you know would prefer to sponsor merchandise for an event (e.g. some Wine or refreshments for an event, or even prizes for events) We'd be happy to have your branding on show too.    If anyone has any questions or queries, please don't hesitate to contact us on info@foxindustriessa.co.za:-)",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>I have spent my whole life around animals, horses in particular and during times of stress and anxiety ""The Yard"" is my happy place where I can forget my worries and immerse myself in the care and wellbeing of the animals. I passionately believe there are countless children and adults who could also benefit enormously from ""yard life"" and improve their lives by building self belief, confidence and reducing stress and anxiety. As well as horses we also have several alpacas and are hoping to create a furry friends area where visitors can meet guinea pigs, chinchillas, chipmunks, budgies, micropigs, pygmy goats and more!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li> <strong>Background history of founder</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Joshua Woods is the founder and  creative director of The Olfactive, a scent project that began 3 years ago. As a way to explore the fragrance industry, he has spent many years in the fragrance sales, distribution and marketing.</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Why the </strong><strong>campaign is important.</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The campaign aims to help get the basics of the marketplace running. Also, to fund a few collaborations with international brands. We believe its very important to help introduce and to display the works of these artists with the world.</p>
<ul><li><strong>What contributors will help achieve.</strong></li></ul>
<p>Contributors will be helping to create a  fragrance market on a international scale. Contributors also are helping to support these brands by helping to expand their market. $25,000 total needed for the upgrade to the market and all funds collected will be used in the following ways.</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Supplies</li>
<li>A creation of a small collection of fragrances</li>
</ul>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Perks range between a custom scent, and a fragrance from our collection.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, the remaining funds will be used to complete the market and marketing.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>One risk is that orders, distribution and shipping don't operate as planned.</li>
<li>One challenge is to connect the brands from different time zones, languages and consumers from all over the world to function as planned.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div></div>","Summary
 
 Background history of founder

Joshua Woods is the founder and  creative director of The Olfactive, a scent project that began 3 years ago. As a way to explore the fragrance industry, he has spent many years in the fragrance sales, distribution and marketing.

Why the campaign is important.

The campaign aims to help get the basics of the marketplace running. Also, to fund a few collaborations with international brands. We believe its very important to help introduce and to display the works of these artists with the world.
What contributors will help achieve.
Contributors will be helping to create a  fragrance market on a international scale. Contributors also are helping to support these brands by helping to expand their market. $25,000 total needed for the upgrade to the market and all funds collected will be used in the following ways.


Supplies
A creation of a small collection of fragrances

Perks

Perks range between a custom scent, and a fragrance from our collection.
If we don't reach our goal, the remaining funds will be used to complete the market and marketing.


Risks & Challenges

One risk is that orders, distribution and shipping don't operate as planned.
One challenge is to connect the brands from different time zones, languages and consumers from all over the world to function as planned.


Other Ways You Can Help

Originally I bought it to help me produce models for a University course, but I quickly realised that I could make a little money doing prints for other people as well, I have been test trading for just over a year now, learning what works and what doesn't and I am now at the point where I want to move to the next level.formwurx 3D print café, studio and learning zone is about creating a space where professionals, hobbyists and absolute beginners can purchase prints at various price points, have an item designed/scanned and printed, learn about the technology and process' involved or simply have a chat with like minded individuals over a good cup of coffee.3d printing is bringing about a democratization of the design and manufacturing process whereby anyone with a bit of knowledge of the 3d design process can become a designer and have their creations prototyped (or even put into short and medium sized production runs) at a far lower cost than was previously possible. 3d printing & scanning technology is becoming cheaper, more accurate, and more accessible to the general public and formwurx want’s to be the first business to bring it to the High Street in Newcastle.The following case studies show some real world applications of 3d printing & scanning and how it could benefit you or your business.Case Study 1: Producing Components that are no longer in productionCase Study 2: High Resolution Wax printing for Jewellery casting Case Study 3: Full Colour Architectural ModelsCase Study 4: Manufacturing Injection Moulds and Sample PartsCase Study 5: Custom Prosthetic Design and ProductionCase Study 6: Medical Printing for Education, Surgical Planning and Patient CommunicationFor more case studies, go here.The case studies above give a glimpse of how 3d printing & scanning can be applied to everyday requirements, for many, however, 3d printing is still a mystery; people want to engage with it, on a professional and/or personal level but don’t know where to start, formwurx wants to change that.With a successful campaign, formwurx intends to open a high street operation in Newcastle upon Tyne (a city rich in technological firsts and creativity, both historically and present day) whereby we intend to provide a wide variety of services to both the individual and the business community, as well as reaching out to local educational organizations.Should the campaign reach tier 4, our intention is to provide the following:
an accessible print and scan bureau service aimed at all budgets; from the hobbyist, to the SME
a retail outlet to purchase 3d printing supplies and consumables for your own 3d printer at home (or even a 3d printer if you have yet to make the plunge), such as filament and resin.
a small café where beginners and hardened makers alike can meet and discuss ideas over a coffee and a bun (maybe even a retro 80’s arcade cabinet, what’s not to like?)
a friendly and knowledgeable team who can advise and assist you in all things 3d printing
regular open events (times to be arranged) where you can come along and learn about 3d printing, see how a 3d model is designed in a computer and then printed
build your own printer classes – we won’t just sell you a printer, we want to be your companion on your first foray into 3d printing so come along with your newly purchased kit and get some top quality advice and assistance in assembling it



To get the idea off the ground formwurx needs to raise a minimum of £50,000, ideally we need to raise closer to £200,000 in order to fit out the studio/café space, purchase the various printers, scanners and other relevant hardware and software. To make things a little clearer, the campaign will have different Tiers depending on the amount of funding we can raise, all rewards are based on reaching Tier 1, if we go higher, the rewards increase too!This is how the space could look:Artists view of the space.Tier 1Total funds raised £50,000This will enable us to purchase the following hardware (or similar items):
Fuel 3D Scanify hand held scanner – provides a mid-range colour scanning facility
1 x Kudo 3D Titan 1 – produces high quality resin models
1 x Solidator – produces high quality resin models but with a larger volume than the Kudo3D
1 x 3DSystems Projet 1200 – produces small but high quality models in a variety of materials including wax
1 x 3DSystems Cubejet (due for release this summer) – full colour 3d models
2 x Ultimaker 2 extended – high quality desktop printers using PLA and ABS plastics
1 x Robo3D Rmega OR Extreme Builder 1000 – for VERY large models, again using PLA and ABS plastics.
If the campaign reaches Tier 1, formwurx will be able to offer a variety of printing and scanning services, but it is unlikely to be a highstreet site, more likely a business unit located out of town.Tier 2Total funds raised £100,000This will enable us to purchase the following hardware (or similar items):
an Artec Eva & Spyder hand held scanners – produces high quality colour scans, including extremely small engineered items.
1 x 3DSystems 3500HD – high resolution printer suitable for a variety of roles (prototypes, engineering, medical, etc…) due to a large material library

2 x Ultimaker 2 extended – high quality desktop printers using PLA and ABS plastics
1 x Robo3D Rmega OR Extreme Builder 1000 – for VERY large models, again using PLA and ABS plastics.
At Tier 2 the café/learning zone should be part of the business, but not necessarily in the town centre.All donations will receive an extra 5% to the discount fund (so if you donated £100 your discount fund will increase by 20% instead of 15%), or for donations below £50, 10% added to your purchase discount.Tier 3Total funds raised £150,000This will enable us to purchase the following hardware (or similar items):

</p><p><b>The back story…</b></p>
<p>Our home has been a
center for music and art play, gatherings for the Oscars and for election
nights. We celebrated the Mayan end of civilization with an Armageddon party.
We put out art supplies and musical instruments and things just happen. People
leave our home saying, “Can’t we just do this every day?” or “Can we just hang
out here forever?”</p>
<p>We decided, in this
autumn of our lives, to answer all those people: “Yes.”<span>  We’re taking all that madness, art and music
and we’re putting it in a social club for grownups.</span></p>
<p>Judy is an
artist.<span>  I’m a musician.  Amateurs.  We love to play—usually with friends.
Professionally we’ve done okay. Restaurants, stores, radio shows, real estate,
newspaper publishing, ministry, teaching, counseling…like most people we’ve
done a lot of things to make a living and pay the bills while dallying in art and music.  But it’s been our play and our friends that’s
kept us sane.</span></p>
<p>We’ve done our
homework.<span>  We’ve calculated the costs and
run the business plan.  It’s what we want
to do with our lives.  Create a third
space: not home, not work or school, but a comfortable, laid-back place where
members can be, watch or listen to creative people.</span></p>
<p>Portland will be the
home of Artlandish, the first creative social club dedicated not to skills, not
to teaching or instruction, not to organizing but to play.<span>  Yes, just play. This campaign isn’t just to
raise some of the capital to seed the business, but to invite early memberships
at fabulous discounts. We hope you’ll support this outlandish Portland
experiment!</span></p><span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1430810/files/20150430184851-ArtlandishLogo.png?1430444931"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span>
<p><b>How it started</b></p>
<p>Over the years a fun
little art and music party blossomed into an important full-blown event. We put
out all our art supplies and musical instruments and invited people to just
play.<span>  Easels, paints, brushes and
canvases, clay, stone and sculpting tools, pastels, pads and pencils were
scattered on tables and at chairs around our home and decks.  Guitars, mandolins, keyboards, harmonicas,
drums and other percussion instruments leaned against chairs and railings,
begging to be picked up and played.</span></p>
<p>We got to be excellent
scavengers of art supplies and musical instruments. Garage sales, thrift
stores, cast offs from artists and musicians…we became rescuers and recyclers
of Portland’s cast off creative toys.</p>
<p>Artlandish will have
all of that and more available to members all the time.<span>  We’ll also have a small store inside the club
to offer new or special art and music supplies. There will be places to store
your projects and supplies.</span></p>
<p>We’ll have some sewing
machines, fabrics and notions for experimenting with design and fashion.<span>  Writers will find laptops and typewriters
available as well as cool spots to relax and create.</span></p><p>For musicians and
singers, there will be a large screen to display chords and lyrics, along with
instruments hanging around waiting for you to try them.</p>
<p>Our funding on this
campaign is to secure the space and prepare it for members including
furnishings, paint, storage and design. We’ll also seed the little store and
fill in items we haven’t yet scavenged from the city. We’re aiming for a beer
and wine license. We’ll need to have some food and noshies, too, along with
coffee and tea.</p>
<p><b>So, then, I need to be an artist or musician…</b></p>
<p>No. This is a play
space.<span>  It’s not an artist community.
It’s a playground for grownups.  We won’t
have private break-out spaces.  Almost
everything is in one big, giant, rustic space. You can simply come in every day
and watch people do art and play music. 
Sometimes what you see and hear will be incredible. Sometimes it might
not.</span></p>
<p>If, in hanging out and
watching and listening, you want to pick up a brush and canvas or some clay and
see what happens, you will have made Artlandish a smashing success!</p>
<p>We hope you’ll bring
your friends in to do some group stuff.<span> 
Music, art, performance…?</span></p>
<p>Besides the daily
space and supplies, Artlandish will have a variety of events. A very special
Valentine’s Day evening, debate and election gatherings, some workshops and
seminars on subjects members are interested. Fashion shows.<span>  Art shows and sales.  Concerts. 
Writer’s readings.  We’d love to
host the Portland Poetry Slam and things like that.</span></p>
<p><b>And what if I am an artist or musician?</b></p>
<p>Excellent!<span>  Besides
providing you with a space to play with your skills and talent, we also offer a
Master’s program. Pros who choose to be Master’s (after some vetting…) can put
on a Master’s badge in the club.  If
you’re wearing that badge, you’re making yourself available to other members.
They can ask you for critique, for advice, for help and encouragement. Masters
can take their badges off if, or whenever, they want to become “just” members.</span></p>
<p>There will be some special perks for our Masters. But we hope
that just sharing your muse with curious, brave people gets your blood running
hot.</p>
<p>“And what if I just come in every day and use up all the
supplies for my art?”<span>  Well, you could do
that.  Most canvases will be used and re-gessoed.
Old brushes.  Half-filled tubes of
paint.  Stuff like that.  We’re actually thinking you might bring some
of your own used up supplies into the club to share!</span></p>
<p>There will be a recording studio and radio station. The
recording studio will be rented by the hour at a pretty ridiculous rate to
members only.<span>  The radio station will
train and accept regular radio hosts to do their own shows in ½ hour
increments.  No experience
necessary.  Relax.  It’s a micro broadcast. But real.</span></p>
<p><b>Challenges and Opportunities</b></p>
<p>People might not join. It’s a weird, slightly ridiculous concept.
Can we take our years of experience in hosting creative events at our home and
our support for Portland’s art community and turn it into a club?<span>  Yes. We can.</span></p>
<p>As Portland’s population density soars, condo and apartment
towers grow like forests. Ensconced in smaller spaces, bordered on two or three
sides within inches of neighbors, the opportunity to have and play instruments
or the room to dedicate to any kind of art is mostly a dream.</p>
<p>But, as a member of Artlandish, you have access to a perfect
creative space with everything you need already sitting there for you to
play.<span>  One of our challenges is to design
a process where members can keep their works-in-progress at the club, with their
tools.  We’ve done it. Canvas and container
racks will hold your stuff.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps our major challenge is to create a flexible space that
can be changed in minutes to accommodate a concert, a poetry slam, a workshop,
a dance, a debate…who knows what can happen?<span> 
We’re only going to set up a couple dedicated spaces: reception,
storage, recording and radio studio. Probably sewing.</span></p>
<p>Everything else will be movable so that we can pick things up
and re-assemble the giant space to fit whatever we need.</p>
<p>Why no kids? First, Portland is a city RIFE with businesses and
places for children. (There’s even more for dogs!) While there will always be a
desire for more, it’s not something Portland is crying out for.</p>
<p>We want to create a space that doesn’t need close supervision. A
space that may not be exactly quiet, but is conducive to conversation and
creativity. And we certainly don’t want to inhibit the art or music of our
members by requiring it to be rated G.<span>  And,
did we mention, we’ll have beer and wine?</span></p>
<p><b>Why invest in Artlandish?</b></p>
<p>We work hard. Life, even in Portlandia, moves quickly. There’s a
million things to do. Somewhere in the din of our Itty Bitty Shitty Committee,
all the voices telling us what we need to do, how to do and be what everyone
needs, how much money and time we don’t have, hurry up, get better, improve…somewhere
in there should be a voice that says, “Come on in.<span>  Breathe. 
Play.  Everything will still be
out there when you leave.”</span></p>
<p>William Stafford use to say two things to the poets and writers
he mentored.<br/>
<i>“Strive to be adequate.”</i><span>  And, <i>“When
you’re stuck, lower your standards.” </i>There is our inspiration and mission
statement!</span></p>
<p>We have lots of spiffs for investors at any level.<span>  Just supporting Artlandish with a smaller
contribution gives hope to the real possibility of creating something new and
powerful. It doesn’t just support the arts. 
It supports play, freedom, laughter and experimentation.</span></p>
<p>At campaign membership levels you secure one of a very limited number, at
fabulous founding member pricing.<span>  When fully
sold, memberships will revert to what we think will be about $600 a year.  Still a decent deal. As a founding member,
though, you can get in for as little as $100 for a 6-month membership--available only during this campaign!</span></p>
<p>Invest in yourself.<span> 
Invest in play and creativity. 
Invest in meeting new people, hearing new ideas, experiencing new
challenges.  Invest in the space to chill
in comfort and without hurry.</span></p>
<p>Be Artlandish.</p>
<p><b>What happens if the campaign doesn’t make its goal?</b></p>
<p>Well, we tried, didn’t we? Starting a new business, especially
one that has no model to copy or emulate, requires some fearlessness (and
perhaps a little foolishness).<span>  We hope
you’ll get us over our goal.</span></p>
<p>And if we exceed our goal?<span> 
Ah, security!  More and better
furnishings. A better launch party.  More
music and art supplies—both new and used. 
And our grateful hearts.</span></p>

From the aircraft to the crews, it all adds up. The good news is that we have found investors who are willing to support Lakeshore Express' return to service by matching our funding goal, which will help us return with the most reliable model possible. So here's an opportunity to help us relaunch Lakeshore Express by Memorial Day Weekend 2015.
What We Need & What You GetOur funding goal of $500,000 will help relaunch service and offset all costs associated with operating flights between Metro Detroit and Chicago, and Chicago and northern Michigan (Pellston). Summer schedules are listed below (Summer being Memorial Day Weekend thru Labor Day Weekend). Depending on your contribution amount, you'll receive one of the various ""perks"" listed to the right (if you are viewing on your mobile device click on the ""Contribute Now"" button above to view), ranging from the best one-way flight money can buy to a private charter for you and up to 29 of your closest friends and family! To be clear. We are NOT simply asking for money. Said ""perks"" are for tickets that you will be able to use once we restart operations (you are welcome to make a separate or added monetary contribution, should you just want to back our mission: To change the way people fly).The Lakeshore Express DifferenceWe'd compare our service to another airline but there is no comparison. Outside of owning your own plane, there's simply not a better way to fly. Why? Because we offer a VIP flight experience for less than commercial airline prices. Think about that. Private terminals, free parking, free baggage handling, free cocktails and snacks. Arrive 20 minutes before your flight, avoiding the chaos and congestion of typical security lines. It really is that easy!
And compared to traditional forms of transportation, including car, train and bus? Well, it all comes down to a matter of time and convenience. We turn a six, seven, eight hour drive into a one hour flight. We give you the freedom of taking a weekend vacation without spending a full day of it commuting. We help you catch an important business meeting and get you back home that evening. We eliminate the stresses of traveling and put time back on your side.    In conclusion, your contribution is making a difference because you're helping to change an entire industry and creating a new standard for the consumer air traveler experience.
Flights Between Chicago and Pellston
No sense in spending your vacation stuck in traffic. Get out of the jam and fly Lakeshore Express. Our convenient, one-hour flights take off after work (arriving before the weekend's first sunset) and return before you're do in on Monday morning. So you never have to take a day off (if you don't want to). Those headed to Chicago can enjoy a long weekend in the city while flying above the ""crowds"".Flights Between Metro Detroit and ChicagoWhether for business or leisure, it's time to say NO MORE to I-94. Maximize your time visiting family and friends in Chicago or Detroit, or take advantage of our new flight schedule (7 day service), making business trips efficient and stress free.

<p><b>Synopsis (short version): </b></p>
<p>“Two men with very diverse backgrounds share one thing, a name.” </p>
<p><b>Location Details: </b></p>
<p>Calgary, LA, and Chattanooga,  have been scouted. We will be paying rate for the job because of the size and specialty of the crews. Time is of essence with this project.</p>
<p>Calgary, AB is becoming a center point in the worlds eye. Alberta offers many grants and incentives the support the filming of any film project.</p>
<p>Chattanooga, TN is within 100 miles of Atlanta, Georgia which is one of the biggest film centers in North America. </p>
<p><b>When?</b></p>
<p>Because of the potential copycat projects we are looking to shoot ASAP. February is “Black Month History” in both Canada and USA. March 17th is St. Patrick Day’s and would be another ideal time to film. Releasing date could have an impact on the presidential race.</p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>Generalizations is a common tool used in hate speech. We hope to break down barriers of labeling. Showing that every individual has the power to change the world, by two very honorable examples some would call a hero.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Story &amp; Synopsis (long version):</b></p>
<p>Patrick Hampton: The Power of a Name, the name Patrick was derived from latin meaning “nobleman”. This documentary is the meeting of two minds with two very diverse backgrounds and opposite political views who honor their namesake. </p>
<p>These last few years Patrick J. and Patrick D. have been battling for the #1 spot on search google. Over a bragging Facebook post, Patrick D. Hampton rubbing in with over 8,000 Facebook likes he had finally took the number one stop. During the thread on of Patrick D.’s friend comment on how Patrick J. should make a movie about him. Needless to say under mutual agreement the men decided to meet and film the experience.</p>
<p>We will follow Patrick D. (Patrick) and Patrick J. (Paddy) into their daily lives. Showing that even though they come from different philosophies, they are spiritual leaders in their respected communities.

<p><b>PHASE III</b></p>
<p>The third phase of our plan is recovering the financing is distribution. Youtube offer’s an amazing platform to monetize and promote the project. We will create a fund to sponsor more events like this and a mentorship foundation to connect students with mentors.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
<p>The market appeal makes Patrick Hampton: The Power of a Name, an automatic winner from a pop-culture and economic stand point. Both Patrick’s have built respectable brands creating real heroes as mentors of the younger generation. This collaboration will promote both of their independent careers creating a movement with the potential of world-wide ramifications.

Having the same name we will travel back through the Hampton roots and how they came to America, as we research origins of a name with the potentially resent genetic ancestors.
A general meet-up will be arranged either in Chattanooga, Los Angeles, or online between Patrick’s of political hot-topic question ranging from absence, medical marijuana, family values, and culture apparitions. We will film the initial round table discussion of minds.
Paddy will travel to Tennessee to spend time with Patrick during daily his life. They we go through Patrick’s social work and community activities, volunteering while gathering good exposure of the facility.

Paddy is ready to offer Patrick a role in his new project, “The Rise of Kings” being filmed in Calgary, AB.

<br/><div>What happens when three brothers, separated by 6,000 miles, come together over a shared love of music and rhythm? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are brothers, musicians, artists, family and our heritage spans two continents. Kris and I grew up in Wales, in an area of outstanding natural beauty. A land of folk tales, castles and poetry (and Tom Jones!).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div> And our cousin Thum grew up in Thailand, an ancient sub-tropical kingdom with its own rich history of music, great warriors and spirituality. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Last summer Kris visited our cousin Thum in Thailand for the first time since they had played together as children. Although they didn't share a language; with art, music and blood between them they found that, though they had been separated by 6000 miles, they had grown into young men with similar passions, ideas, hopes and dreams.<span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Thum makes Binghi Drums and plays music whenever he can find the time, while working full time on a farm to support his  young family. As a parting gift he made Kris and I a Binghi Drum to take back to Wales so we could carry on jamming half the world away. </span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>When Kris got home and we used the Binghi to jam - lightening struck! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>With Thum's artistic skill and our business knowledge we could bring these beautiful, musical pieces of art to the world! Kris and I were amazed at how easily we incorporated the Binghi into our music, how accessible it would be to everyone, not just skilled musicians. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>... and Thaibinghi was born. </div>

<p>At the moment material costs are high because Thum has to walk miles to get the materials... One day we’d like to buy Thum a vehicle because at the moment he can only get materials for one Binghi, per walk…!

</div></div>","Help a Small Business Grow, and Help a Community(Thum's Son, Thum, Kris & cousin Fun)
What happens when three brothers, separated by 6,000 miles, come together over a shared love of music and rhythm? 

We are brothers, musicians, artists, family and our heritage spans two continents. Kris and I grew up in Wales, in an area of outstanding natural beauty. A land of folk tales, castles and poetry (and Tom Jones!).

 And our cousin Thum grew up in Thailand, an ancient sub-tropical kingdom with its own rich history of music, great warriors and spirituality. 

Last summer Kris visited our cousin Thum in Thailand for the first time since they had played together as children. Although they didn't share a language; with art, music and blood between them they found that, though they had been separated by 6000 miles, they had grown into young men with similar passions, ideas, hopes and dreams. 


Donate now!


Thum makes Binghi Drums and plays music whenever he can find the time, while working full time on a farm to support his  young family. As a parting gift he made Kris and I a Binghi Drum to take back to Wales so we could carry on jamming half the world away. 


When Kris got home and we used the Binghi to jam - lightening struck! 

With Thum's artistic skill and our business knowledge we could bring these beautiful, musical pieces of art to the world! Kris and I were amazed at how easily we incorporated the Binghi into our music, how accessible it would be to everyone, not just skilled musicians. 

... and Thaibinghi was born. 





Please, support our dream. 
We want to bring these Thai-style, handmade, Nyabinghi drums to the world! 

We're currently in the very early stages of planning and building the business into an online entity, to distribute these beautiful handmade Binghi Drums all around the globe wherever there are jams and good vibes. 

We can see ThaiBinghi's in:

schools
with religious groups

professional and amateur musicians

used in meditation/therapy
as show pieces in every home!


But it won't stop there!

We want to create a community in Thailand, where Thum can train more Artisan Drum Makers, where they can earn a good living from being artists and musicians, from doing what they love! 



But we need your help.

£2,500 will pay for a few Thaibinghi drums to be made and to mature the business. Your help will enable us to:


Pay Thum a fair wage so that he can concentrate on developing his craft
Test Market the Binghi's
Explore more Thaibinghi designs
Develop the web platform for our online business
Lay the foundations and grow the dream
We are currently receiving invaluable business mentorship from The Princes Trust, your donations will enable us to take the first few steps in growing into a small, ethical and sustainable business. 

Working with Thum and local suppliers means there is no middleman to pay. The biggest challenge in this stage is streamlining and perfecting the production process, supporting Thum so that he can concentrate on developing our line of handmade drums and building the business so that we're ready to bring Thaibinghi to the world. 






Our hopes for the future of Thaibinghi


Workshop 

One day we hope to have a workshop and design studio in Thailand, where we can build a community of skilled artisan drum makers, pay fair wages and make art into a good living for local Thai people. 

At the moment material costs are high because Thum has to walk miles to get the materials... One day we’d like to buy Thum a vehicle because at the moment he can only get materials for one Binghi, per walk…! 





Sustainability

Part of our ethos is sustainability, doing great things in the right way. We would seek to utilise the most sustainable routes in our production, building of the workshop and in business.

Part of the vision is to one day have a Thaibinghi ethical clothing range… you could help us realise this dream! ...and get some cool threads!

Community

We want to build a community where art and creativity is celebrated and where our artisan drum makers can make a living from their art. In this way we hope to support the local people and the local environment by putting back into the Thai economy, paying fair wages and locally sourcing all our materials from sustainable origins. 

The ThaiBinghi community we’d like to create would celebrate art and creativity as a valuable trade. We’d seek to grow this community,  providing opportunities for  more than Thum and his son, we want to train local people who share in this passion for music and creativity. 

Quality

Quality handmade musical instruments with soul, that don’t cost the earth. 
Our Binghi Drums are not only instruments but beautiful pieces of art. They are made from:


Sustainable and locally sourced Momosa Wood
Quality hand-worked metal
Free range goat hide


     




Get drumming into the mainstream

Drumming is unique and accessible by anyone. 

Rhythm is an ancient therapy and a way to connect with the moment and the people around us. We feel that everyone can benefit from this practice, drumming is already going through a revival and we want to add to this momentum by creating, not only practical and quality Binghis, but beautiful drums that don't cost the earth.

<p>The REVOcaster uses molds filled with liquid resins to make its parts, and the rotating nature of the machine pushes all the liquid to the edges of the mold to make the cast hollow. As the machine spins, the resin solidifies, and after 10-15 minutes your part is ready.</p>

<p>A really interesting thing with the epoxy resins is you can use dyes and powders to change the coloring of the finishes, or give the final product a metallic / bronze look.

<p>To create an open-minded and tranquil healing retreat space for all cultures and belief systems.  Shanti Toya is a place where people can come together and heal their bodies, minds, and spirits.  They can find connection through sharing their experiences and wisdom with one another, while immersing themselves into the local Balinese culture.  It is our hope that guests will be forever touched by the deep sense of joy and fulfillment that often comes while living in simplicity and harmony with others and the natural environment, and realize the need for a more sustainable existence.  </p>

<h2>The Land</h2>
<p>Shanti Toya ashram is a magical place, with a special energy felt by all who step foot on the land.  It’s set among the hillside in a jungle ravine, and abundant with water and wildlife.  The small rural village of Penarungan borders the property, as well as beautiful rice paddies and farmland, offering a truly authentic taste of Bali.   Even with such a peaceful and remote location, Shanti Toya is still located only 20 minutes SW from the internationally-known hub of Ubud, commonly referred to as the mecca of yoga by the international yoga community.  This is one of the many reasons that make Shanti Toya a perfect destination for healing and sharing. Since first finding the land in 2014, and through much hard work and dedication, a beautifully tranquil sanctuary and retreat center is nearing completion!</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are:


This story is about
a small and very compassionate group of dynamic leaders, from very diverse
backgrounds, bound by their commitment to the project and vision of Shanti Toya, and their common thread interests in: 
·  yoga, meditation, & healing through the mind-body-spirit connection
· 
human rights and equality
·  the sharing and preservation of traditional customs and wisdom
· 
environmental conservation, permaculture,
& sustainable building
· 
eco-conscious and mindful travel and
awareness
· empowering communities to reduce
the exploitation of our environment,   including its people, cultures, resources,
and animals; not only globally, but specifically on the small and densely
populated island of Bali, Indonesia.   





Shanti Toya 

We are a newly built yoga and wellness retreat center set in a rural farming village just outside of Ubud; the heart of Bali.  Bali is regarded as the “Island of The Gods”, rich with spiritual traditions that draw in seekers from far and wide as well as being world-renowned by surfers seeking their best wave.  As Bali’s tourism industry has exponentially grown over the last decades, so has the urgent need for environmental awareness and education and the implementation of sustainable practices. 

What makes our team at Shanti Toya special is our collective desire to make the world a better place. 

Our Vision
To create an open-minded and tranquil healing retreat space for all cultures and belief systems.  Shanti Toya is a place where people can come together and heal their bodies, minds, and spirits.  They can find connection through sharing their experiences and wisdom with one another, while immersing themselves into the local Balinese culture.  It is our hope that guests will be forever touched by the deep sense of joy and fulfillment that often comes while living in simplicity and harmony with others and the natural environment, and realize the need for a more sustainable existence.  


Shanti Toya will also serve as a platform for outreach programs in environmental education and community engagement whereby awareness and sustainable practices are increased; first starting small and eventually expanding our sphere of influence and outreach as we grow and become self-sustaining. 





The Land
Shanti Toya ashram is a magical place, with a special energy felt by all who step foot on the land.  It’s set among the hillside in a jungle ravine, and abundant with water and wildlife.  The small rural village of Penarungan borders the property, as well as beautiful rice paddies and farmland, offering a truly authentic taste of Bali.   Even with such a peaceful and remote location, Shanti Toya is still located only 20 minutes SW from the internationally-known hub of Ubud, commonly referred to as the mecca of yoga by the international yoga community.  This is one of the many reasons that make Shanti Toya a perfect destination for healing and sharing. Since first finding the land in 2014, and through much hard work and dedication, a beautifully tranquil sanctuary and retreat center is nearing completion!




Lets Make A Difference!



In addition to the negative impacts
of tourism on Bali due to the lack of infrastructure and foresight on how to manage such a shift, there is also a lack of
awareness on how to rectify these issues; like the water crisis and the mis-management of
plastics and trash. The possible solutions that we would like to start with
require a strong community foundation and source of income to implement and sustain
the programs.  
With your support we will
be able to make life changing impacts in our community in the following ways: 


Implementing
water catchment tanks and filtration systems in the smaller villages without city water, also reducing
the amount of water taken from an already depleted resource.

Fair
trade work for local families to include but not limited to: yoga props, construction,
gardening, and cooking.


Permaculture
practices utilized and taught to local community members


Building
an Infrastructure within Shanti Toya that can be a leading example to
volunteers, guests, and local community


Housing
and food for our volunteers (safe, friendly, open environment)


Spa
facilities as a source of revenue to become self-sustaining


Identify,
implement, and teach practices that improve waste management; reducing single-use plastics and water consumption


Community
outreach programs such as; trash clean up, recycle bin delivery, language
classes, donation based yoga classes, etc.

*The potential for positive change in the way we
travel in Bali is limitless. The goal here is not to stop traveling, but to travel
consciously.  We can be a great example through
spreading awareness and being sensitive to not only the Balinese culture but
also the beautiful environment. Being integrated with the culture we can build
a bridge to better understanding and respecting each other and our ways of
living.

<p>We black people,  have been victim of the police's terroristic behaviour for centuries now.

This time, we will not protest,  we will not march and we will not stay indifferent to the attacks! <strong>WE WILL TAKE ACTION...WITH OUR DOLLARS</strong>!!!</p>

<p>Hello... I have been a small business owner for many years. I owned an in home daycare for several years but unfortunately, I had to close that business due to COVID 19. I also have an online business that carries handmade items such as; essential oil bracelets, earrings, autograph stuffed animals, dog bandanas, hair bows, cloth napkins, and many other items. I have been successful selling online but I also have been to many vendor shows and find the experience exciting and fun. Vendor shows also seem to be the most successful and profitable way to sell my items.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Philomath Crafts and Supplies is a small Winnipeg based business that has been providing retail and wholesale distribution of craft supplies through the Etsy Marketplace ecommerce platform since September 2017. We are currently looking at expansion to a physical commercial location.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a Retail and Wholesale distribution center that is large enough to offer the supplies and tools necessary for any type of craft. Our store will be locally owned and operated, and designed from the ground up with the Manitoba Handmade Community in mind. We want to make it easy, affordable, and profitable for you to produce your crafts and share your art with the world.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Manitoba is home to a diverse community of artists and crafters offering an amazing assortment of handmade products for sale at local craft sales and fairs, farmer's markets, and similar events year round. Sadly, Winnipeg is home to very few craft supply stores, with the retail market for craft supplies being dominated by Michaels Arts and Crafts.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, finding the supplies and tools necessary to make and sell crafts often involves online ordering, driving to several different small specialty supply stores, or paying huge mark ups, making it difficult to create and sell crafts at a living wage or reasonable profit.</p>
<p>By helping to fund our campaign, you are making a huge positive impact on the local economy. Once Philomath Crafts is able to open our Craft Supplies distribution center, we will be able to directly help the local economy by creating new jobs, paying taxes, and offering a space for the sale of locally produced tools and supplies. In addition, by providing easy and affordable access to crafting tools and supplies, we will be encouraging the growth of the local handmade market, making it easier and more profitable for Manitoban Artists to create and sell. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Fast Facts</h3>
<ul>
<li>In 2016 a Statistics Canada Genera Social study reported that 5.2 million Canadians over the age of 15 practice crafts</li>
<li>During the 2008 global economic recession, the cultural and craft sector saw less employment reduction across Canada than other industry sectors. </li>
<li>The United Nations Development Programme stated that the cultural sector is the fastest growing sector for job creation, income earning, and export opportunities and recommended that any country focusing on strengthening their economy should invest in their cultural and handmade goods. </li>
<li>According to the Canadian Crafts Federation, the percentage of persons self employed in the crafts sector is 26%, which is more than twice that in the overall economy (12%), and from 1993 to 2003 small business accounted for 80% of net job creation.</li>
<li>In 2016, the sale of handmade goods had an economic impact of 2.5% on the Manitoban economy ($1.6B of the Manitoban GDP)</li>
<li>In 2018 Retail Craft Supplies Industry sales revenues was an estimated $675M across Canada, with an estimated $18.9M spent by small business crafters and artists.</li>
<li>A 2016 federal study claimed that some of the greatest challenges artists face are low profit margins, lack of time, and limited resources.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>To fund expansion to a physical location in Winnipeg, Philomath Crafts and Supplies will be applying for government grants and business loans in the year 2020. As part of the requirement for these applications, we need to have raised a minimum of 30% capital prior to application of financing. We are currently raising funds ourselves through ecommerce sales and seeking private investors and/or business loans, but we need your help to reach our capital goal. </p>
<p>When we reach our $30 000 fundraising goal, funds will go towards the business as follows (estimates rounded to the nearest $100):</p>
<ol>
<li>$1 500 estimated platform fees to Indiegogo for crowdfunding campaign</li>
<li>$500 estimated payment processing fees for crowdfunding campaign</li>
<li>$2 000 legal fees for expansion</li>
<li>$1 000 point of sale and barcode hardware and inventory control costs</li>
<li>$2 500 retail display shelving </li>
<li>$1 500 payroll / human resources system costs</li>
<li>$1 000 marketing / advertising costs for location launch</li>
<li>$20 000 purchase of inventory</li>
</ol>
<p>If the initial fundraising goal is not reached, funds will be distributed in order as listed above until full amount raised is invested.</p>
<p>If we exceed our initial crowdfunding goal, excess funds will go towards the business as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepayment towards lease and renovation of a commercial space</li>
<li>Employee wages once location has been opened</li>
<li>Purchase of additional inventory to expand available product lines</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Further perks will be offered as the campaign progresses.</li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any business expansion faces a number of risks and challenges and Philomath Crafts and Supplies is not immune to this fact. But by being aware and prepared, we can reduce the risks and overcome any challenges we will face.</p>
<ol>
<li> Financing is always and issue: Our campaign goal is only 30% of the start up funds we'll need to open our retail and wholesale distribution center. While there are several government grants and business loans available to help us raise the other 70%, they are not guaranteed sources. To increase our chances of securing the additional funds, we are putting together a stellar business plan and researching all possible avenues. We have obtained business training and coaching through SEED Winnipeg in 2019 to ensure that we are prepared to rise above this challenge.</li>
<li> Market demand is incredibly high: Once Philomath Crafts is able to open our retail and wholesale distribution center there is a good chance that we will not have the immediate capacity to deal with local demand. Based on our current numbers for investment we estimate that we will be able to fulfill approximately 2% of the market for craft supplies purchased by small business crafters and artists. This means that for the first few months our product line will not be as expansive and we would like it to be and we run the risk of running out of high demand products. We are going to mitigate this risk by closely monitoring sales and current inventory, ensuring that most if not all of our products are sourced from suppliers with short lead times, and being prepared to reorder inventory and expand our product line immediately and significantly if necessary.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone is able to contribute financially, but that's okay. You can still help in lots of ways:</p>
<ol>
<li> Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word about our campaign online so you can help us to connect with others that are interested in helping.</li>
<li>Talk about Philomath Crafts and Supplies with your friends, family, and coworkers. Remember, we're planning to open our retail and wholesale distribution center in 2020 so the local community will want to keep updated on how close we are to reaching our goal.</li>
<li>Provide us feedback and suggestions for how we can make Philomath Crafts and Supplies the best place to purchase crafting tools and supplies in Manitoba. What area of Winnipeg should we be located in? What types of products should we carry? What special perks and services can we offer to keep our customers happy? We need to know!</li>

 Market demand is incredibly high: Once Philomath Crafts is able to open our retail and wholesale distribution center there is a good chance that we will not have the immediate capacity to deal with local demand. Based on our current numbers for investment we estimate that we will be able to fulfill approximately 2% of the market for craft supplies purchased by small business crafters and artists. This means that for the first few months our product line will not be as expansive and we would like it to be and we run the risk of running out of high demand products. We are going to mitigate this risk by closely monitoring sales and current inventory, ensuring that most if not all of our products are sourced from suppliers with short lead times, and being prepared to reorder inventory and expand our product line immediately and significantly if necessary.

 

Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone is able to contribute financially, but that's okay. You can still help in lots of ways:

 Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word about our campaign online so you can help us to connect with others that are interested in helping.
Talk about Philomath Crafts and Supplies with your friends, family, and coworkers. Remember, we're planning to open our retail and wholesale distribution center in 2020 so the local community will want to keep updated on how close we are to reaching our goal.
Provide us feedback and suggestions for how we can make Philomath Crafts and Supplies the best place to purchase crafting tools and supplies in Manitoba. What area of Winnipeg should we be located in? What types of products should we carry? What special perks and services can we offer to keep our customers happy? We need to know!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>NUESTRA HISTORIA</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Junto a un equipo de profesionales del sector empresarial, Técnicos en Administración de Empresas y Gestión Administrativa, sentimos que era el momento de dar este paso y tomar la decisión de seguir impulsando a Producciones Del Prado.</p>
<p>El Deporte y en concreto el fútbol jugó un papel  preponderante en mi vida y en la de mi familia, asociado nuestro apellido a los hitos más altos del balompié y atletismo Uruguayo.</p>
<p>En un momento dado y luego de dejar el fútbol, y a sabiendas de que nos apasiona el deporte, de una forma u otra volveríamos a él, pero antes y por algún tiempo, viajé, me capacité y trabajé en sectores totalmente diferentes,  que nos dio la experiencia y las herramientas necesarias para emprender y seguir el sueño de tener nuestro propio negocio.</p>
<p>En el año 1995 creé la marca Producciones Del Prado, ligado este nombre a la gran historia del fútbol Uruguayo. Fue allí en la pintoresca zona Del Prado de Montevideo, donde los jugadores de la Selección Nacional Uruguaya, campeones de 1930, concentraron en un hotel de su época previo a la final del primer campeonato del mundo. Rodeados estos de un entorno natural, que al día de hoy se sigue manteniendo y refleja el espíritu y sello de nuestra firma comercial.</p>
<p>Producciones Del Prado no es sólo una marca comercial, es:  “Emociones En Movimiento”.</p>
<p>Con una historia y un legado atrás.</p>
<p>En el año 2003 decidimos trasladarnos a España, es aquí, donde comenzamos una nueva etapa, donde se abre una nueva ventana en nuestras vidas, que nos lleva a tener una nueva actitud y esto nos obliga a dar un nuevo giro a nuestro negocio, hacer un nuevo enfoque, aplicar un nuevo modelo de negocio, llevando nuestra marca comercial a la era digital.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>DIFERENCIAS E INNOVACIÓN</strong></h2>

<p>Llevaremos nuestros productos y servicios hacia donde tú estés en el medio local, regional o nacional. Queremos conocerte y saber en qué podemos ayudarte. Y si estás lejos, no te preocupes, vía Skype te podemos atender y escuchar. Nos dices el día, la hora y te agendamos.</p>

<p>Nuestra garantía es: “Si no estás satisfecho te devolvemos el dinero”.</p>

<p>En un constante crecimiento, invertiremos siempre en  innovación y desarrollo de nuevos productos, como pueden ser: nuevos soportes publicitarios, diseños de packing o nuevas prendas deportivas con textura y diseños vanguardistas para vestir a Equipos deportivos y/o amantes del deporte.</p>

<p>Nuestro proyecto anterior, en soportes publicitarios para estadios de fútbol, para favorecer las marcas de sponsors y patrocinadores, demuestran nuestra capacidad en la mejora de nuevos soportes publicitarios.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RIESGOS Y DESAFIOS</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nuestra marca comercial es sinónimo de experiencia, seguridad y confianza. Sólo necesitamos que nos pongan a prueba.</p>
<p>No se puede iniciar un negocio ni hacerlo crecer sin asumir riesgos, pero eso no significa que, para gestionar un negocio deban asumirse demasiados riesgos. Desde el primer momento, queremos establecer una cultura de minimización de riesgos y de costes.</p>
<p>Como filosofía, desde el inicio, trabajaremos con rigor en el control de los costes y sobretodo moderando y restringiendo sistemáticamente el crecimiento de nuestros gastos fijos, aspecto esencial para afrontar cualquier imprevisto a medio y largo plazo.</p>
<p>El mercado está en constante cambio como así también hay cambio de ciclos económicos.  Por ello, día a día debemos estar preparados para anticiparnos y enfrentar esos cambios, ya sean políticos, sociales o económicos.</p>
<p>Adaptarnos rápidamente a esos cambios con una previa planificación, es la respuesta que nosotros tenemos en caso de llegar a producirse.</p>
<p>Es por ello, que prevemos siempre  tener en puerta, a más de un proveedor de servicios y contar con socios estratégicos en distintos mercados. Realizaremos acuerdos comerciales con fabricantes  y plataformas proveedoras de servicios deportivos.</p>
<p>Nuestro negocio es sostenible, escalable. Por lo tanto, uno de los desafíos, pasa por crear una infraestructura que respalde la explosión que estamos anticipando.</p>
<p>El crecimiento implica responsabilidad y  con tu aportación estarás ayudando a crear puestos de trabajos, incorporando también personas con diversidad funcional.</p>
<p>La motivación nos lleva a que deseamos ser líderes en ventas de productos y servicios deportivos.</p>

</h2><p> </p><p><strong>Gabriel Arispe Franco:</strong></p><p>Practiqué Fútbol, deporte hermoso para mí, desde los 7 años hasta los 18 años. Al mismo tiempo compaginé estudios y deporte, pasando por distintos clubes en Montevideo (Uruguay), hasta llegar a militar en el Club Sudamérica y obtener el título de Liga del Campeonato Uruguayo de la Segunda Divisional Profesional.</p><p>La Institución Atlética Sudamérica (IASA) realizó una excelente campaña en el año 1986/87 subiendo a Primera División. Me citan a los entrenamientos el 02/01/1988 para integrar y ganarme un lugar en la plantilla de Primera División de la siguiente temporada.</p><p>Luego de dejar el fútbol y terminados mis estudios, me gradúo como Técnico en Gestión Administrativa (Título homologado en España).</p><p>Trabajé en el área de la Comunicación en distintas Agencias de Publicidad, Medios de Prensa y empresas de Diseño Gráfico, desempeñándome como ejecutivo de grandes cuentas.</p><p>La pasión por el Deporte me llevó a continuar y volcar toda mi experiencia  en  el  desarrollo de Producciones Del Prado.

NUESTRA HISTORIA
 
 
Junto a un equipo de profesionales del sector empresarial, Técnicos en Administración de Empresas y Gestión Administrativa, sentimos que era el momento de dar este paso y tomar la decisión de seguir impulsando a Producciones Del Prado.
El Deporte y en concreto el fútbol jugó un papel  preponderante en mi vida y en la de mi familia, asociado nuestro apellido a los hitos más altos del balompié y atletismo Uruguayo.
En un momento dado y luego de dejar el fútbol, y a sabiendas de que nos apasiona el deporte, de una forma u otra volveríamos a él, pero antes y por algún tiempo, viajé, me capacité y trabajé en sectores totalmente diferentes,  que nos dio la experiencia y las herramientas necesarias para emprender y seguir el sueño de tener nuestro propio negocio.
En el año 1995 creé la marca Producciones Del Prado, ligado este nombre a la gran historia del fútbol Uruguayo. Fue allí en la pintoresca zona Del Prado de Montevideo, donde los jugadores de la Selección Nacional Uruguaya, campeones de 1930, concentraron en un hotel de su época previo a la final del primer campeonato del mundo. Rodeados estos de un entorno natural, que al día de hoy se sigue manteniendo y refleja el espíritu y sello de nuestra firma comercial.
Producciones Del Prado no es sólo una marca comercial, es:  “Emociones En Movimiento”.
Con una historia y un legado atrás.
En el año 2003 decidimos trasladarnos a España, es aquí, donde comenzamos una nueva etapa, donde se abre una nueva ventana en nuestras vidas, que nos lleva a tener una nueva actitud y esto nos obliga a dar un nuevo giro a nuestro negocio, hacer un nuevo enfoque, aplicar un nuevo modelo de negocio, llevando nuestra marca comercial a la era digital.

RIESGOS Y DESAFIOS
 
 
Nuestra marca comercial es sinónimo de experiencia, seguridad y confianza. Sólo necesitamos que nos pongan a prueba.
No se puede iniciar un negocio ni hacerlo crecer sin asumir riesgos, pero eso no significa que, para gestionar un negocio deban asumirse demasiados riesgos. Desde el primer momento, queremos establecer una cultura de minimización de riesgos y de costes.
Como filosofía, desde el inicio, trabajaremos con rigor en el control de los costes y sobretodo moderando y restringiendo sistemáticamente el crecimiento de nuestros gastos fijos, aspecto esencial para afrontar cualquier imprevisto a medio y largo plazo.
El mercado está en constante cambio como así también hay cambio de ciclos económicos.  Por ello, día a día debemos estar preparados para anticiparnos y enfrentar esos cambios, ya sean políticos, sociales o económicos.
Adaptarnos rápidamente a esos cambios con una previa planificación, es la respuesta que nosotros tenemos en caso de llegar a producirse.
Es por ello, que prevemos siempre  tener en puerta, a más de un proveedor de servicios y contar con socios estratégicos en distintos mercados. Realizaremos acuerdos comerciales con fabricantes  y plataformas proveedoras de servicios deportivos.
Nuestro negocio es sostenible, escalable. Por lo tanto, uno de los desafíos, pasa por crear una infraestructura que respalde la explosión que estamos anticipando.
El crecimiento implica responsabilidad y  con tu aportación estarás ayudando a crear puestos de trabajos, incorporando también personas con diversidad funcional.
La motivación nos lleva a que deseamos ser líderes en ventas de productos y servicios deportivos.

 Gabriel Arispe Franco:Practiqué Fútbol, deporte hermoso para mí, desde los 7 años hasta los 18 años. Al mismo tiempo compaginé estudios y deporte, pasando por distintos clubes en Montevideo (Uruguay), hasta llegar a militar en el Club Sudamérica y obtener el título de Liga del Campeonato Uruguayo de la Segunda Divisional Profesional.La Institución Atlética Sudamérica (IASA) realizó una excelente campaña en el año 1986/87 subiendo a Primera División. Me citan a los entrenamientos el 02/01/1988 para integrar y ganarme un lugar en la plantilla de Primera División de la siguiente temporada.Luego de dejar el fútbol y terminados mis estudios, me gradúo como Técnico en Gestión Administrativa (Título homologado en España).Trabajé en el área de la Comunicación en distintas Agencias de Publicidad, Medios de Prensa y empresas de Diseño Gráfico, desempeñándome como ejecutivo de grandes cuentas.La pasión por el Deporte me llevó a continuar y volcar toda mi experiencia  en  el  desarrollo de Producciones Del Prado. Siempre y cada día, aprendo y me adapto a las distintas situaciones que exige el impulso de nuestro emprendimiento. Graciela Fraga Tagliabúe:En mis comienzos, me he desempeñado en el Sector Público, en la Gerencia de Hacienda y Tesorería de  U.T.E. (Administración Nacional de Usinas Eléctricas) Montevideo-Uruguay, en el área Financiero-Contable. He adquirido la capacitación y manejo de aplicaciones informáticas con el Grupo Unión Fenosa España.Me encanta viajar!  Fui muy afortunada al poder conocer países de diferentes Continentes. Su gente, sus costumbres, su historia, las diferentes culturas, han forjado en mí, una riqueza que sólo se guarda en la mente y corazón. En el transcurrir de los años, me dedico al Turismo, trabajando en Agencias de Viajes en Uruguay y en España, siempre con el afán de volcar a los demás, mis experiencias de vida, adquiridas en mis viajes.En mis primeros años de residencia en España, he escrito varios artículos para el Periódico Vida Nueva de Los Ángeles-California (EEUU) en calidad de Corresponsal para la Comunidad Valenciana en el sector turístico.Luego, por intermedio del Turismo, descubro como calidad de vida: el Deporte.  El bienestar físico, emocional, espiritual, que implica la práctica del Deporte, en cualquiera de sus disciplinas, es sencillamente indescriptible.  Por ello, me uno a Producciones Del Prado, desde donde se quiere transmitir la toma de consciencia y la importancia de la práctica del Deporte, entre otros temas; llegar a todas las personas, a todas: las que les gusta, las que no les gusta, pero…puede que sí. Personas con diversidad funcional, personas con enfermedades raras que contagian la alegría de vivir y son un ejemplo a seguir.  CONTACTO           gabrielarispefranco@produccionesdelprado.com       gracielafraga@produccionesdelprado.com            Móvil :    +34 659 316 728    MUCHAS GRACIAS!",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>East Coast Gymnastics was a staple business in Merritt Island for nearly 30 years.  Their owners, Fred Maffeo and his wife and 9 children, were known for being friendly and generous.  Even though the business closed, Cole Maffeo never lost his passion for coaching.  He has joined forces with Tanaya Williams, a gym manager with 25 years of experience and a National Instructor for USA Gymnastics, to relaunch East Coast Gymnastics!  </p>

<h3>Fort Elsewhere: We're Building the Getaway Campground of Your Dreams! </h3>
<p>Fort Elsewhere is a beautiful slice of heaven secluded in Vernon County, Missouri, just a short drive from the crossroads at Nevada. With easy access from Kansas City, Springfield, Joplin, and Witchita, Fort Elsewhere is a perfect location for gatherings, weddings, events, and more!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570989807/ocarotlesfnvzgniqirh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fort Elsewhere already offers primitive camping, canoeing, hunting, fishing, and nature walks around our 124-acre campus. But this is just the start of our plan. Now we setting a singular stage for your wedding, reunion, re-enactment, star gazing, or event of every other description. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570990239/juzmdf8b4oub8yyyld3j.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This is where you come in! </strong>With your help, we can fast track the first phase of the property's development. Become an early sponsor and put your mark on the property so that our guests will see your generosity for generations to come, or claim a priority time for your church, family, community, or corporate event as soon as the venue is open!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Master Plan</h3>
<p>Fort Elsewhere will be developed in 5 phases: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Phase 1 - Medieval Fortress Town</strong></li>
<li>Phase 2 - Viking Village</li>
<li>Phase 3 - Frontier Main Street</li>
<li>Phase 4 - Themed Cabins</li>
<li>Phase 5 - Outdoor Event Space, themed gardens, and hiking trails</li>
</ul>
<p><i>All of these phases will be really cool, but this fundraiser is about Phase 1. Look for future fundraisers to put your mark on the remaining phases!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570993767/ae1gyiph6xleu524gf1u.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>Phase 1 - Medieval Fortress Town</h3>
<p>This phase is the creation of a medieval-inspired event space in three terraces: Low Town, Market Square, and High Town. </p>
<ul>
<li>Low Town will feature small primitive cabins in the style of medieval huts, providing comfortable overnight housing for large groups and youth camps. </li>
<li>Market Square will recreate the bustling atmosphere of the heart of a medieval town. Here, visitors can try their hand at a variety of period trades and crafts. The Square will be anchored on one end by a functioning Tavern, and on the other with a medieval style Inn that has all the modern amenities.</li>
<li>The street leading up to the gates of the Fortress will be lined with charming, climate-controlled, year-round cottages, forming High Town, perfect for your VIPs, staff, or family gatherings.  Each cottage will have its own bathroom and kitchenette. </li>
</ul>
<p>Fort Elsewhere itself will be a stylized recreation of a 13th century Motte featuring a great hall  designed to accomodate up to 200 guests with all the supporting facilities. The Lord and Lady suites atop the hall and the chambers below offer luxury unheard of in the middle ages to wedding parties and overnight events. </p>
<p>Phase 1 is already underway.  Our next steps are graveling the drive way, running a power line, and building the Inn and Tavern. Here are details on each part:</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 - finish the driveway and run a power line: $18,000</strong></p>
<p>Sitting 3/4 of a mile back from the main road, cutting a driveway out of what has been field and bog has not been easy, especially given the historically rainy year we've had! These funds will be used to gravel the driveway and install a power line. </p>
<p><strong><i>Stretch Goal! </i>Part 2 - The Inn and Tavern: $60,000</strong></p>
<p>The Medieval Fortress Town will have a market square, high town, low town, Fortress and fort walls.  The anchors of the market square are the Inn and Tavern, and we are planning to build these two buildings first. Using hay bale construction, we plan to make affordable and durable buildings that evoke a medieval feeling while being comfortable year-round.  These funds will be used to construct these two primary buildings.</p>
<p>After Part 2 is done, Fort Elsewhere will be ready to host your event, with overnight accomodations for 30 people. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570995076/vrxasu04v4y3p7m8qlmd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>Stretch Goal! </i>Part 3 - High Town: $15,000</strong></p>
<p>The upper class deserve the finer things in life, and that means they get cabins away from the riff-raff.  In this phase we will build 4 individual cabins, each capable of sleeping 5-10 people.  Each cabin will be two stories with seperate living and sleeping spaces and have its own bathroom and kitchenette. </p>
<p><strong><i>Stretch Goal! </i>Part 4 - The Fort and Walls: $??,???</strong></p>
<p>We can't be Fort Elsewhere without a Fort! In this phase we will raise money to build a stone fort at the entrance of the Medieval village, and a wall encompassing the village.

<li>Priority Booking</li>
<li>Discounts for the group or event of your choice</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are more details about these great rewards! </p>
<p><strong>Group Discounts</strong></p>
<p>Every contribution made to Fort Elsewhere will earn a group or event of your choice a credit towards their site fees. <strong> Every $1.00 contributed equals $1.50 credit</strong>, so let us know the group or event that you wish to give your credit to when you make your contribution! </p>
<p><strong>Recognition and Storage: The Inn, Tavern, and Cemetary</strong></p>
<p>Every contribution counts towards meeting our goal, and some contributions leave an impression that will be visable for the world to see! There are three areas of the Medieval Fortress Town where you can leave your mark: the Inn, the Tavern, and the Cemetary! </p>
<p>In <strong>the Inn </strong>you have the option of customizing a  12""x12"" section of tapestry that will be custom made to decorate the walls, or the option to customize the door to a cubby or cupboard that you then have exclusive access to for a 5 year period!

<p><strong>The Tavern </strong>will also have tapestries for customization and storage as well, but the storage will have a themed twist! In the Tavern the storage will be camoflauged in the form of wine racks and wine barrels!  </p>
<p>Since no medieval village would be complete without someplace to put the victims of maurading bandits, famine, or the black plauge, the <i>final </i>place to leave your mark will be the mock <strong>cemetary</strong>.  Add a name to our pauper's grave wall, customize a wooden grave marker and leave buried treasure behind for curious explorers to find, or choose to have a masoleum built, with a door that you can customize, and spacious storage inside that you have exclusive access to! We are also offering a limited number of deluxe masoleums, with special features that are secret to everyone but those who grab them first!  This fun and spooky way to create ambiance in the village is one you can't pass up! </p>

</div></div>","Fort Elsewhere: We're Building the Getaway Campground of Your Dreams! 
Fort Elsewhere is a beautiful slice of heaven secluded in Vernon County, Missouri, just a short drive from the crossroads at Nevada. With easy access from Kansas City, Springfield, Joplin, and Witchita, Fort Elsewhere is a perfect location for gatherings, weddings, events, and more!

 
Fort Elsewhere already offers primitive camping, canoeing, hunting, fishing, and nature walks around our 124-acre campus. But this is just the start of our plan. Now we setting a singular stage for your wedding, reunion, re-enactment, star gazing, or event of every other description. 

 
This is where you come in! With your help, we can fast track the first phase of the property's development. Become an early sponsor and put your mark on the property so that our guests will see your generosity for generations to come, or claim a priority time for your church, family, community, or corporate event as soon as the venue is open!

 
The Master Plan
Fort Elsewhere will be developed in 5 phases: 

Phase 1 - Medieval Fortress Town
Phase 2 - Viking Village
Phase 3 - Frontier Main Street
Phase 4 - Themed Cabins
Phase 5 - Outdoor Event Space, themed gardens, and hiking trails

All of these phases will be really cool, but this fundraiser is about Phase 1. Look for future fundraisers to put your mark on the remaining phases!
 

Phase 1 - Medieval Fortress Town
This phase is the creation of a medieval-inspired event space in three terraces: Low Town, Market Square, and High Town. 

Low Town will feature small primitive cabins in the style of medieval huts, providing comfortable overnight housing for large groups and youth camps. 
Market Square will recreate the bustling atmosphere of the heart of a medieval town. Here, visitors can try their hand at a variety of period trades and crafts. The Square will be anchored on one end by a functioning Tavern, and on the other with a medieval style Inn that has all the modern amenities.
The street leading up to the gates of the Fortress will be lined with charming, climate-controlled, year-round cottages, forming High Town, perfect for your VIPs, staff, or family gatherings.  Each cottage will have its own bathroom and kitchenette. 

Fort Elsewhere itself will be a stylized recreation of a 13th century Motte featuring a great hall  designed to accomodate up to 200 guests with all the supporting facilities. The Lord and Lady suites atop the hall and the chambers below offer luxury unheard of in the middle ages to wedding parties and overnight events. 
Phase 1 is already underway.  Our next steps are graveling the drive way, running a power line, and building the Inn and Tavern. Here are details on each part:
Part 1 - finish the driveway and run a power line: $18,000
Sitting 3/4 of a mile back from the main road, cutting a driveway out of what has been field and bog has not been easy, especially given the historically rainy year we've had! These funds will be used to gravel the driveway and install a power line. 
Stretch Goal! Part 2 - The Inn and Tavern: $60,000
The Medieval Fortress Town will have a market square, high town, low town, Fortress and fort walls.  The anchors of the market square are the Inn and Tavern, and we are planning to build these two buildings first. Using hay bale construction, we plan to make affordable and durable buildings that evoke a medieval feeling while being comfortable year-round.  These funds will be used to construct these two primary buildings.
After Part 2 is done, Fort Elsewhere will be ready to host your event, with overnight accomodations for 30 people. 

Stretch Goal! Part 3 - High Town: $15,000
The upper class deserve the finer things in life, and that means they get cabins away from the riff-raff.  In this phase we will build 4 individual cabins, each capable of sleeping 5-10 people.  Each cabin will be two stories with seperate living and sleeping spaces and have its own bathroom and kitchenette. 
Stretch Goal! Part 4 - The Fort and Walls: $??,???
We can't be Fort Elsewhere without a Fort! In this phase we will raise money to build a stone fort at the entrance of the Medieval village, and a wall encompassing the village. Featuring multiple stories and a beautiful entry way, this will be an incredible location to hold your wedding, feast, or house the royalty traveling with you on your adventure!  Everything we raise after our first goals are reached will be allocated toward building the Fort itself.

<h3>Who Are We? </h3>
<p>Founded by a pair of dog-loving architects, artists, and designers, Wearable Love is on a mission to design stylish designer wearables that is affordable for everyone. We believe that what you wear is an expression of who you are, and we want you to wear your values in style.</p>
<p>In our startup, we’re blending our passion for chic artwork with our compassion for dogs, and navigating the intersection of work and pleasure, timeless and wearable, style and affordability.</p>
<p>Our latest project was inspired by a familiar source of uninhibited joy. Our two little fluffers are rescue dogs who enjoy a good belly rub as much as we enjoy making a difference to our customers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Challenges Are We Facing?</h3>
<p>Clothing is a highly saturated market. Even with bold design and a careful business plan, making money selling wearables is hard. In order to be profitable, we simply have to order in bulk. Once we raise $4,187, we will be able to place our first bulk order from the factory. The more we raise, the more we will be able to do.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How Does Your Support Save Lives?</h3>
<p>During this special time of global pandemic, <strong>we will be donating <u>50%</u> of our profits</strong> to rescue groups that are doing incredible work to save lives. These groups are working hard even today as the COVID-19 pandemic makes that difficult, and they’re committed to moving towards a world where no healthy animal has to be put down. You see, the majority of medium and large commercial no-kill shelters have a dirty secret. They may not kill animals on-site, but when they are at full capacity and see a new “high-quality” animal they’d like to take in, they ship another one off to a kill shelter to make room. Although we salute the good work that all shelter workers do, it’s necessary to recognize that many no-kill shelters are contributing in to the same cruel and backwards system that kills thousands of healthy animals daily in the USA. That is why we are going to great lengths to identify groups that we will donate to. Those groups 1) have a track record of excellence, 2) are not profit-driven, and 3) are in action even today under the coronavirus outbreak to find homes for small animals in need. </p>

<p>Not all dogs are lucky.</p>
<p>Animal shelters often run at or over full capacity, especially in springtime when litters of puppies and kittens are born. When shelters are over capacity, healthy, loving animals get put down in large numbers. Although the situation has improved somewhat, about 1.5 million dogs and cats are put down every year in the United States.</p>

Coronavirus is forcing animal shelters and rescue groups to close, cancel adoption and fundraising events, and to run at minimum staff or shut down completely. This means that capacity is at a particularly low point and very few animals will be adopted out. To make matters even worse, many shelters expect another surge of incoming animals when people who are sick or have been laid off and can no longer afford to take care of their dogs are forced to give up their pets, like what happened during the 2008 recession.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's Next For Our Start-up?</h3>
<p>If this campaign is successful and the business proves to be viable, we hope to offer a line of clothing, home decor, and accessories with chic, stylish art featuring your favorite dog breed. Starting with our chihuahua design, our dream is to build a database of dozens and eventually hundreds of designs.</p>
<p>Therefore, as we are running this campaign, we’re also recruiting furry mascots! If you’d like like a custom artistic shirt or perk with your pal on it, send us a few photographs (clear image of animal with white background) and we’ll send you the merchandise (large orders will be discounted). If we love the look, we may ask your dog or cat to be the next superstar that features his/her breed!</p>

<p>The founders, Envick and Rodriguez, have secured a space in Warehouse 5 right along the banks of Alazan Creek.

<h3>Futuristic, ecological, healthy, ethical and sustainable</h3>
<p>My name is Maida. People say I'm a very first vegan in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but there's no proof. However, I was an animal rights leader in my country. The number of new vegans and vegetarians is constantly increasing, and as well there is a first official vegan society in BiH. Last summer, together we fought against amending Bosnian Animal protection and welfare law, in order to stop deleting fur-farming ban, and we won!</p>
<p>I can't be a full-time activist, but also I can't stay passive. So, I decided to do something for myself and the rest of the planet - Vegan club and restaurant in downtown of Sarajevo.</p>Its design is going to be all in natural mode, with plants all over the place. I also tend to rent a huge place and to hire 3 cooks, 4 waiters, 2 deliverers and an accountant <p> </p>
<p>The menu is going to be diverse:</p>
<ul>
<li>classic vegan fast food (burgers, falafels, pizza, tofu steak, hummus, grilled mushrooms and vegetables)</li>
<li>specialities (including vegan ćevapi)</li>
<li>finger foods</li>
<li>snacks</li>
<li>cakes, pancakes and ice cream</li>
<li>lunch packets </li>
<li>special breakfasts</li>
<li>raw food specialities and drinks</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I need 26.000 $?</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Because I want to ensure my employees will be paid for their work.</li>
<li>Because I need to pay rent in advance.</li>
<li>Because I need to redesign a place I take.</li>
<li>And because it has to be sustainable before it gets to gain some money. </li>

So, I decided to do something for myself and the rest of the planet - Vegan club and restaurant in downtown of Sarajevo.Its design is going to be all in natural mode, with plants all over the place. I also tend to rent a huge place and to hire 3 cooks, 4 waiters, 2 deliverers and an accountant  
The menu is going to be diverse:

classic vegan fast food (burgers, falafels, pizza, tofu steak, hummus, grilled mushrooms and vegetables)
specialities (including vegan ćevapi)
finger foods
snacks
cakes, pancakes and ice cream
lunch packets 
special breakfasts
raw food specialities and drinks

 

Why I need 26.000 $?
 

Because I want to ensure my employees will be paid for their work.
Because I need to pay rent in advance.
Because I need to redesign a place I take.
And because it has to be sustainable before it gets to gain some money.

<h2><strong><i>BACK STORY</i></strong></h2>
<p>Embarcadero Brewing Company and Supplies was founded by four fans of the beer making process.  But mostly, we are fans of drinking delicious ales.  Jorge, Gustavo, Arturo and Marco all got together one night and realized that we all shared one dream; owning and operating a brewery in our town.  </p>
<p>Jorge, native of National City has been home brewing for over a decade.  All in the meanwhile, passing along all that sweet knowledge to his younger brother Gustavo. Both mastered the arts of creating ales in their garage.  Marco quickly became a fan and recruited his brother Arturo to join in and create the mighty Embarcadero Brewing Co. LLC.   With the knowledge we learned serving our country and community, we opened the south San Diego's first homebrew shop.</p>

<p>Cape Verde is a small archipelago, on the West African Coast, of stunning beauty. But what makes Cape Verde special is its people and its Morabeza, the way people welcome those visiting the country. This oasis in the middle of the Atlantic has attracted, in the last 10 years, great investments (large resorts), implementing the all-inclusive model.<br/>Although these large investments are an asset to Cape Verde, it is questioned whether the model has any impact on the lives of the Cape Verdean producers and the communities where the investments were made.<br/>We knew that something should be done. We came up with this idea, a Cape Verdean Sustainable Tourism project. Therefore, a few years ago, we started the Sustainable Tourism project in Cape Verde on social networks, first on Facebook and later, on Instagram.<br/>Our strategy is to take Cape Verde to the world. We want to promote a different type of tourism, focused on direct contact with Cape Verdean population and culture. With this objective, we have worked, free of charge, as an online tour operator, giving assistance to thousands of tourists who want to spend their holidays in Cape Verde. We have been using GetitSocial's resources to fund this initiative.<br/>We want more for Cape Verde. We want more for Cape Verdeans.<br/>To achieve our goals, we have decided to tackle one of the greatest local economic development problems: It is a small market.<br/>We have created an online platform where Cape Verdean producers and artisans can sell their product to millions of Cape Verdeans around the world and to people that love Cape Verde. Imagine anyone, anywhere in the world, being able to buy products made in Cape Verde directly from the producer's hands.<br/>""Do you want an old grog?""

The cost of shipping products through the Cape Verdean Post. The shipping can be up to four times the price of the product itself. There is no assured time framework for the product to get to its destination.<br/>We could not put this burden on the consumers. Our hope was on the only private parcel delivery in the country, the international DHL. DHL would solve our shipping security problem and would ensure that the product would reach the customer's door, anywhere in the world, in the maximum two weeks’ time. Otherwise, the money would be refunded. That sounded like a great idea. However, DHL is expensive as well. Even more expensive than the Cape Verdean Post. The only advantage is the scheduled time to package delivery.<br/>After a lot of negotiation, we reached an agreement with the company, that made us a 70% discount on the shipping price in exchange of our Internet marketing services. A win-win situation. Nonetheless, we still have a problem. DHL offers excellent services and gives us all the guarantees that the product would arrive safely and on time. Unfortunately, even with the 70% off, the cost of shipping is still three times the price of the product itself. This situation only left us with two options: either we would ask the clients to pay for the parcel shipment or we would pay for the shipment ourselves. We have decided for the second option. <br/>Our decision brought as here today. We need your help to finance the shipment. You, all the people that love Cape Verde, around the world, join us and help as you can. We are asking for help o fund the shipping for two years.

<h3><b>And
one bar to rule them all</b></h3>
<p>Greetings,
programs! I'm James Kenna. Along with my hospitality team, I hope to open NYC's
first dedicated geek tavern.  With the explosion of comic books, video
games, anime, and various other forms of geekdom, I realized what a glaring
hole we have in the Manhattan hospitality market. We will offer amazing food
and drink in an atmosphere that everyone's inner nerd can enjoy. Waypoint is
going to be a staple in the community–with classic sci-fi fantasy movie nights,
book signings, Rock Band karaoke, nerdy burlesque, trivia, gaming tournaments,
geek singles events, and so much more.  We have already spent nearly a
year developing the business plan and artistic team behind this project,
heavily investing personal time and money. With all systems go, this endeavor is ready to launch. We're ready to get our game on. Are
you with us, NYC?</p>
<h3><b>The
gorram deal</b></h3>
<p>In
NYC there's a pub or sports bar on every block, but finding a place to geek
out can be quite the challenge.  Opening near the L-train in the East
Village district of Manhattan, Waypoint will be only a hop, skip, and a jump
away from our friendly neighborhood geeks. Waypoint will be a tavern that opens its heart to comic book lovers,
tabletop gamers, classic sci-fi fans, and every other fellow nerd. We're going top off this amazing experience with a dynamic duo of food from our celebrity chef ""The Blade"", and drinks from an amazing
mixologist ""The Muddler""<br/></p>
<h3><b>With
great donations come great responsibility</b></h3>
<p>Opening
a tavern in New York City is not cheap. With an anticipated total cost of
$600,000, we need another $300,000 to hit our goal.  This campaign will
allow us to finish raising the rest, while moving forward with our
groundbreaking, so that we're ready to open in August of 2016.  We are
asking for a considerable amount of money, but we know that the unique experience we're offering will be worth every penny. In turn, we at Waypoint believe that hospitality goes beyond the doors of the establishment and plan
to pay your kindness forward; we have planned quarterly events to fund some of
our favorite charities, including Charity: Water,  Chive Charities,
Milk+Bookies, and the Robin Hood Foundation.</p>
<h3><b>Try
not. Do or do not. There is no try.</b></h3>
<p>Opening a Tavern in
NYC comes with many challenges, but most failures come from lack of experience
and vision. Fortunately, these are two things  that Waypoint has in spades.  We have
over 30 years of combined hospitality management experience and have collaborated
with multiple consultants to create this exemplary concept.  Therefore, regardless of meeting our goal,
we will still pursue opening our venue by August 2016.  </p>
<h3><b>Guys,
before I go, I just want to tell you: you were fantastic. Absolutely fantastic.
And you know what? So was I. </b></h3>
<p>Do you know what makes you S.P.E.C.I.A.L.?  Largesse! I
may be remembering that wrong, but with a little luck, we can still make this
happen. Even if you can't afford to help out, please support Waypoint by
getting the word out!  Tell your friends about the shining new icon coming
to the geek community (that also serves up delicious bites).  In our
growing nerd market, we need a place to congregate and mingle – help Waypoint
become that place.   Viva la geek revolution!<br/>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Short Summary</b></h1>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Firstly, i want to tell you a little something about myself... </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">My name is Sam, i am 19 and i have been an entrepreneur from a very young age. I started back in school by buying sweets from a Wholesale Company, then going Home and making sweet bags to then take in to School the next Day and sell to my friends. I would have people flocking around me as i walked through the gates which was a great feeling as i could see that i had made people happy by giving them something to make their day a little bit better as well as a bit of money in my Pocket so it was a WIN WIN situation and that's what i liked... </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I then moved on to buying and selling on eBay from Wristbands to Clothes and onto other Crazes as time went on. Recently, i started to learn Web Design and have built a few for myself, family and friends and have learnt an awful lot. Since i can remember, I have wanted to have my own website and i have always been a bit of a Gadget Geek as well as having expensive taste meaning i have always wanted the latest Tech.  I have been teaching myself Website Design for nearly 2 years and have learnt an awful lot and wanted to build a Shop as practise (which i did). So i thought, ""Why not put all the passions together and create a Gents Accessories Website?"" so thats what i have done and my Website is called GENTSGEAR!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Customer Service has always been a priority to me and that is one of the reasons i feel that my Website is like no other, along with other reasons such as:</p>
<p>
</p>
<b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Simple Website to navigate</span><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">High Quality Products</span><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Support Indiegogo Inventors by backing and selling their products</span><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Affordable Prices</span><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Make worldwide products more accessible in the UK</span><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Impecible customer service</span></b><br/><ul>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">So what i need from you is a contribution as small or large as you wish to help fund the Stock so it is ready to deliver when the Shop opens. The Website is ready and waiting. The only issue is the monies to order all of the Stock so that it is ready for you. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Once the Campaign ends, the stock will be ordered and the Website will be updated with the new products all in time for November so you could save your voucher for Christmas Shopping if you wanted to.</p>

Short Summary
Firstly, i want to tell you a little something about myself... 
My name is Sam, i am 19 and i have been an entrepreneur from a very young age. I started back in school by buying sweets from a Wholesale Company, then going Home and making sweet bags to then take in to School the next Day and sell to my friends. I would have people flocking around me as i walked through the gates which was a great feeling as i could see that i had made people happy by giving them something to make their day a little bit better as well as a bit of money in my Pocket so it was a WIN WIN situation and that's what i liked... 
I then moved on to buying and selling on eBay from Wristbands to Clothes and onto other Crazes as time went on. Recently, i started to learn Web Design and have built a few for myself, family and friends and have learnt an awful lot. Since i can remember, I have wanted to have my own website and i have always been a bit of a Gadget Geek as well as having expensive taste meaning i have always wanted the latest Tech.  I have been teaching myself Website Design for nearly 2 years and have learnt an awful lot and wanted to build a Shop as practise (which i did). So i thought, ""Why not put all the passions together and create a Gents Accessories Website?"" so thats what i have done and my Website is called GENTSGEAR!
Customer Service has always been a priority to me and that is one of the reasons i feel that my Website is like no other, along with other reasons such as:


Simple Website to navigateHigh Quality ProductsSupport Indiegogo Inventors by backing and selling their productsAffordable PricesMake worldwide products more accessible in the UKImpecible customer service

So what i need from you is a contribution as small or large as you wish to help fund the Stock so it is ready to deliver when the Shop opens. The Website is ready and waiting. The only issue is the monies to order all of the Stock so that it is ready for you. 
Once the Campaign ends, the stock will be ordered and the Website will be updated with the new products all in time for November so you could save your voucher for Christmas Shopping if you wanted to.
Check out the Website now to see what's available. 
*Please note that you cannot order until the campaign has ended*

<p></p>
<p>In exchange for an app or service, we have to trust a
business or government to protect and treat our personal data responsibly. It's the deal.</p>
<p>But they collect more data and correlate it with yet
more data, then profit from it in ways we never knew. <i>Our private information is the ore for new revenues</i>. <b>We’re raw material</b>. <i>And for it, we get almost nothing.</i></p>
<p>That invasive profile is supposed to be safe and
secure so we’re at least not putting ourselves in danger. But it's not; and we
are. <i>Every day another data breach proves
that behind closed doors our most valuable secrets are ripe to be exposed</i>. <b>Then it's our problem.</b></p>
<p>Risk without reward <i>or</i> control?</p>
<h3>It’s Unreasonable. Irresponsible. Unfair.</h3>
<p><b><i>Digital Liberty</i></b> changes that. We need transparency. Except the digital world is <i>not</i> transparent today. So we have to decide how to protect our own data
and how much it's worth. We need to hold onto it and let it be used how we choose.</p>
<p>Slick and convenient user experience masks failing
security and data protection. That threatens our safety. And the effects will
last a lifetime.</p>
<p><b>We're putting control back into our hands. We're promoting practices and tools that will make the web work for all, not just businesses. <i>We speak for digital individuals' interests.</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<h3>Take the Lead</h3>
<p>I created <b><i>Digital Liberty </i></b>and need your help. <b><i>Subscribe!</i></b> If you believe and have the skills and interest to make an impact; <b><i>join us</i></b>.</p>
<p><b>IF YOU BELIEVE, join! </b><i>The worst thing you can do is know what to do and still do nothing</i>. Don’t let what’s coming just happen. Somebody has to do something: that somebody is us. It’s you.</p>
<p><b><i>Digital Liberty</i></b> is a counterbalance for a fair, reasonable,
and responsible web.</p>

<h3>Founders get more than a good feeling</h3>
<p><b>We need your help</b> to make Digital Liberty a force. As a Founder,
you’ll support action and help give a meaningful voice to <i>people</i> online. That’s important. It’ll be something to brag about later. (“I was there back in ’15… We started this…”)</p>

<h3>We love the web, but we’re concerned…</h3>
<p>When a business that's supposed to be all about privacy (Ashley Madison) <i>charges money to delete personal information</i> <b><i>and then doesn't</i></b>, how can you ever NOT be SCARED of what's going on behind the computer screen?</p>
<p>With hacks and invasions by government, it’s no wonder 7 in 10 people are troubled about corporations violating their privacy and 50% are concerned about governments.</p>
<p>When businesses gather our data to use apps with unreadable usage and protection terms, then use the data in ways we never knew about or expected (or got paid for!), how can you not be ANGRY?</p>
<p>Still, <b>there is no unified voice for all of us</b>  <i>people</i> overwhelmingly concerned about the state of the web—which we all love and need.</p>
<p><i>Why?</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">… because it’s not for people; it’s for business.</h3>
<p>Maybe because while the web seems like it’s for <i>people</i>, it’s really a platform for business. It has evolved to satisfy business’s not people’s needs.</p>
<p>Maybe because nobody’s asks <i>people</i> about the web and digital life that’s changing us—and whether we’re good with that. Nobody’s asked whether you want to have, or offered you the chance to voice concern about your long-term digital future.</p>
<p>Maybe nobody thinks your data is your property and you’re owed something for it.</p>
<p>Maybe because businesses like Avid Life (Ashley Madison) think you'll never find out they're not doing what they say.</p>
<p>Maybe because we’re not <i>people</i> any more; we’re just “users” and “consumers.”</p>
<p>There's nobody to watch that everyone's digitally doing what they say they’ll do and paying for what they use. <b><i>So who’s protecting and advancing the interests of digital individuals?</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<h3>Make the web work for all…</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">…especially <i>People</i>.</h3>
<p>That’s what this campaign is about. About individuals. About the power of a large group. About making the web a respectful and fair place for everyone. It’s about having a meaningful, global standing with the businesses and governments redefining the web.</p>
<p>To do that, I created <b><i>Digital Liberty</i></b>. It’s all of us, representing all of us: the people that use the web, who know it's a basic right. <b><i>Digital Liberty </i></b>will be your eyes, your ears, and your voice.</p>
<p>The web is for everybody, so <b><i>Digital Liberty </i></b>will get us to the table to tell and keep telling businesses and governments what <i>people</i> want and need from a digital life.</p>
<h4>Together, we're a force</h4>
<p>A force needs money and people. Size matters. In the future we'll be funded through member subscriptions, sponsorships, and sales of approved privacy and security tools (discounted for members).</p>
<p><b><i>Right now, today, it needs a little money to get going.</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<h3>The <i>Digital Liberty Association</i> is ESSENTIAL…</h3>
<p>The world needs <b><i>Digital Liberty.</i></b> Especially now. Large organizations do things that others without their access to skills and resource can’t do. They tilt the field to their advantage. And right now, we <i>people</i> on this field are stuck.</p>
<p>That’s capitalism. That’s good. Creating advantages with special knowledge or resources is business bedrock. Businesses aren’t malicious. They’re doing what they do. AND they <i>are</i> giving you things you say you want.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">…so everyone gets a fair deal.</h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Notice how fast the reaction to corporate and government information breaches have been compared to when it’s just people’s information records?</span><br/></p>
<p>When businesses profit by exploiting our data, why aren’t we <i>at least</i>
asked and compensated?</p>
<p>Why hasn’t more been done to prevent your new car from being hacked through the web and taken over <i>while you’re driving</i>?</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Consumer commerce needs a counterbalance.</h3>
<p>Capitalism and what businesses do, innovating to create wealth and progress, is awesome. The <b><i>Digital Liberty </i></b>has no intention of preventing that.</p>
<p>But sometimes, new counterbalances are needed for new times. Like when Ralph Nader revealed in his 1965 book, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsafe_at_Any_Speed"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Unsafe at Any Speed</a>, that the automobile industry was not making cars safe for the consumers (""<i>people</i>"") who “wanted” them. Sound familiar? The car companies before the late 1960s and digital businesses today don’t have incentive to change. They need a nudge. That’s what Nader did. <b>That’s what the <i>Digital Liberty </i>will do</b>.</p>
<p>Remember, without consumer push-back in the 1960s, tooling around in your car would be even more dangerous than it is today.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440008888/jhaci7ur7hfcpwlufjv4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In 50 years, we need to be able to look back and say we’re safe and fairly treated in our digital lives because in 2015 we pushed back.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Be a Founder: Subscribe!</h3>
<p><b><i>We need you to take a Founder’s subscription during this campaign.</i></b></p>
<p>It’s not a lot: <i>about $20 </i>for a one-year subscription and the perks of being a Founder. With that money, we’ll move ahead.</p>
<h4><i>“Get Started” Level</i></h4>
<p>With about 10,000 Founders, providing money and skilled help, we’ll make the website and information aggregator rock; we’ll develop communications, outreach, and development programs for members, Founders, and sympathetic organizations; we’ll kick off a social media program.</p>
<h4><i>“Let’s Go” threshold</i></h4>
<p>At about 20,000 Founders, we’ll add staff to start the advocacy programs; push farther with communications/outreach; create a research program; develop educational videos, events, and resources; and implement self-sustaining revenue to be fully operational by year-end.</p>
<h4><i>“Giddy-up, We’re Serious!” Level</i></h4>
<p>If lots of people believe this campaign is as important as we do, so there are 50,000 Founders or more, everything will be faster and more effective. We'll put
specialists in place and build stronger credibility and standing in newsrooms and boardrooms around the world. We’ll source new tools and processes to take control of our digital lives.</p>
<h4><i>We need you.</i></h4>

<p>I’ve been involved in information and web technology, digital identity, privacy and cyber-security for a long time. <b><i>The situation is out of balance</i></b>. I tilted my small parts of the table.Now <b><i>I want to correct that imbalance</i></b>.</p>
<p>I’m tired of having to second-guess what’s going to happen when I do something online. I can’t understand why I get no choice but to give up all my information blindly for now and forever. And I really don’t like that my property—my data—gets used to make money and I get nothing for it.</p>
<p>I’ve written and spoken about this in every form imaginable. Blog, Twitter, non-fiction and a novel, essays, podcasts, conferences… We all know fundamentally, <b>you have to trust the environment and those in it</b>. Right now, digitally, we do (sort of) but probably shouldn’t. Together we can change that.</p>
<p>There are processes that will make it fair. There are tools that will put control back into the hands of the data’s owners. There are changes that could be made that would make the web work for all of us. We need to make them part of the system.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Challenges to come</h3>
<p>I’m not naïve. There will be resistance from the organizations whose style might be cramped. This could include the companies and brands at the center of the web and mobile world: device makers, app makers, security companies, internet service providers, governments and businesses offering online services, and so on.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>Balance and fairness have a cost</i></b><b>.</b></p>
<p>They’ll try to ignore and dismiss us. They’ll try to misdirect by refocusing these concerns as something else; by sidestepping these real issues with talk of user experience and convenience; by trying to discredit us. They will try to be louder. (It’s happened before.)</p>
<p>What will overcome that? Three things.</p>
<ol>
<li>We all stand <i>together</i> and stand <i>firm</i> for what we believe, need, and want.</li>

In exchange for an app or service, we have to trust a
business or government to protect and treat our personal data responsibly. It's the deal.
But they collect more data and correlate it with yet
more data, then profit from it in ways we never knew. Our private information is the ore for new revenues. We’re raw material. And for it, we get almost nothing.
That invasive profile is supposed to be safe and
secure so we’re at least not putting ourselves in danger. But it's not; and we
are. Every day another data breach proves
that behind closed doors our most valuable secrets are ripe to be exposed. Then it's our problem.
Risk without reward or control?
It’s Unreasonable. Irresponsible. Unfair.
Digital Liberty changes that. We need transparency. Except the digital world is not transparent today. So we have to decide how to protect our own data
and how much it's worth. We need to hold onto it and let it be used how we choose.
Slick and convenient user experience masks failing
security and data protection. That threatens our safety. And the effects will
last a lifetime.
We're putting control back into our hands. We're promoting practices and tools that will make the web work for all, not just businesses. We speak for digital individuals' interests.
Take the Lead
I created Digital Liberty and need your help. Subscribe! If you believe and have the skills and interest to make an impact; join us.
IF YOU BELIEVE, join! The worst thing you can do is know what to do and still do nothing. Don’t let what’s coming just happen. Somebody has to do something: that somebody is us. It’s you.
Digital Liberty is a counterbalance for a fair, reasonable,
and responsible web.
Digital Liberty makes the web work for all
Founders get more than a good feeling
We need your help to make Digital Liberty a force. As a Founder,
you’ll support action and help give a meaningful voice to people online. That’s important. It’ll be something to brag about later. (“I was there back in ’15… We started this…”)
And your money gets you something of immediate, real value. The small Founder premium will fuel the organization until it runs on its own.
Here’s what you get as a Founder.


We need lots of people to be a force. Bring your skills to the team.

a major role in the discrimination against women and girls. Your contribution
will go a long way in helping uplift the lives of women

We have successfully since the beginning of 2015 brought
women together to create bonding and friendship, to build a culture of trust and
promote collaboration. We seek to build upon that foundation to introduce healing
and empowerment programs.

You will be recognised among the visionaries who have
realised that empowering women positively impacts the world and brings harmony
to our earth.

      Other Ways You Can Help 

If you feel called to assist but cannot financially
contribute, then we will still appreciate your help in getting the word out and
linking us with the right people. Any technical assistance would also be
useful. We still honour the visionary in you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hey everyone, my name is Ray Parga and I own
del Valle Gunsmithing, I’ve owned the business since 2004 when I bought it from
Jaime del Valle, whom I apprenticed under. Originally based in Carmel Valley CA
and there for 22 years, I realized that I was going to have to change location
to be more centralized on the Monterey Peninsula. Moving into Marina in 2009 I
quickly saw the potential for expansion and did so again in 2014. Since
then, more and more customers ask if I have a range and if I did, how great it
would be. Well now, it is time for the next evolution of del Valle Gunsmithing.
As much as I’d prefer to make this happen on my own, logistically and fiscally
it’s just not possible so I turn to donors to help make it happen. Our goal in this
drive is to raise the funds to cover the price for a parcel of property that we can
build on, permits and the like. From there we will get a construction loan and
start the building process. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If we do not reach our goal in the allotted time then
     all funds will be returned in full to each donor. This is an important aspect to this drive that I specifically was looking for.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We established some great perks for anyone who is kind enough to help us accomplish this dream, and help us establish a great range in the heart of the Monterey Peninsula.

<p>Are you tired of wasting time and money looking for a place to park? We sure are! We want to help as many people as possible with one of their everyday problems. So we came up with a plan to solve the parking problems, many of us face every day. </p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that the challenge is this: We need to know with certainty if a spot is empty or not. This can only be achieved with sensors and only if they are installed both in paid and free parking spots. For that to happen, at a quick pace, we will offer the sensors installed to the cities <b><i>for free</i></b>.</p>
<p>Drivers will pay a small fee in the order of 50 cents to one dollar, every time they use the sensor information to locate a parking spot. The entire system will be funded by the users. Just imagine how much time and money you spend driving around, looking for a spot. Compare this to a fee of 50 cents to a dollar and you get the idea.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make the system self-sufficient in power by utilising battery power for the sensors and a mix of battery and solar power to drive the network itself. The system will be a stand alone system, so the cities won't have to do anything to integrate it. They can manage everything from an iPad.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To pull this off, we are contracting with the team at Chaotic Moon Studios of Austin Texas (check them out at </span><a href=""http://www.chaoticmoon.com).These"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">www.chaoticmoon.com</a>). <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">These guys are experts, not only in app development, but also in the art of software-hardware integration.

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Funding</b><br/></p>
<p>Why the 2 million as target? That amount is the bare minimum, we need to produce the software and two batches of sensors which we will install in the EU and the US at the same time. Besides Indiegogo fee, travel expenses and general lunch money, that is the only thing the funding will be spent on. No crazy salaries or things of that nature. Extra funding will go directly into extra sensors.</p>
<p>In case we don't reach our goal, the funding will be returned to you guys.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Perks</b></p>
<p>Sorry guys.....no cups or t-shirts. What you do get though is your money back in form of free use of our parking system, in the same amount that you pledged. So, if you pledged 10$, you will gain free use of the system 10-20 times depending of the initial fee. But lets be realistic, if you don't live in one of the two launch cities, this may take a while. But please continue reading.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The target of this campaign is to determine if our approach will be accepted by you, the drivers. Establish procedures for installation and deployment, but those are targets..... If this works, the <i><b>impact</b> </i>will be huge. We will have a parking business model ready to be rolled out to any city, anywhere. After all, this is no fun if the campaign only pays for two smaller cities being equipped with sensors. We need the sensors deployed everywhere in a rapid self fuelled expansion.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Risks and challenges</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We foresee five different axes of challenges in this particular project.</p>
<p>1.  Hardware challenges. The sensors we plan to install will have to contain electronics capable of operating under extreme conditions like temperatures and pressure. On top of that it must be able to sense and communicate using an absolute minimum amount of power in order to conserve the on board battery power. These factors are in themselves obstacles. But we are pretty certain, we can overcome them. Why?...because it has been done before by a number of companies. If they can do it, so can we. </p>
<p>2.  The cities. Our customers are, of course, you guys parking your cars. But the streets, you park in are mostly owned by the city, and we need their permission to install our hardware. We need to convince the cities of the fact that our solution is the future. Two things working for us here. First, there are thousands of cities, so if one doesn't like the idea, or is hesitant, it is on to the next one. Second. We will install everything at no cost to the city. It will be installed for free. We are pretty sure this will be a big motivator.</p>
<p>3.  Software. If you ever operated an app on a smart phone, you know that a flawlessly working app is a bliss. Bliss however is hard. We need to make the interface as simple as humanly possible. To achieve this, we are contracting with the techies at Chaotic Moon. Judging from their previous work, we are certain they are the best to get the job done.</p>
<p>4.  Finance. What we are pledging for will cover software and hardware for a limited batch of sensors. This batch will serve as seed for a hopefully successful business model. However, if the public adaptation of the system does not accelerate at the same pace as production of new batches of sensors, we may have to seek capital from seed investors. Of course, all this is dependent of exactly how much is pledged in the initial Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>5.  You guys are our last challenge. As of writing, we really have no idea if you, the customer, will like the project. We are talking about changing peoples habits in how they park their cars. And that is a very tough challenge. But let's put it this way. If you will fund it, this means we at the very least have your attention, and by that a good indication of whether or not you are willing to change your parking habits.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The stuff in fine print</b></p>
<p>Look, we are not going to blow sunshine up your most elevated body part when you are picking strawberries. This project, like any other, will face headwinds. Over the years various, startups have tried and failed on a number of crowdfunding sites. This campaign, like all the others, have a high risk of failing. It's just the nature of startups. I would hate for anyone contributing to this campaign, not to understand this fact. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And on that little happy note, that's really all there is to it. Any support will be hugely appreciated. If you are not ready to support financially, please help us create a buzz around this campaign and share using the Indiegogo share tools.</span></p>

And on that little happy note, that's really all there is to it. Any support will be hugely appreciated. If you are not ready to support financially, please help us create a buzz around this campaign and share using the Indiegogo share tools.
Thank you for your time.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>My name is Heather, I am 33 years old and I am the owner of The Little Cheesecake Company in the town of Simcoe, Ontario.<br/></p>
<p>With the help of my super generous and flexible fiance, Myles, I operate a food truck every weekend year round- yes, even in the snow! <br/></p>
<p>We currently offer over 70 flavours of individually sized cheesecakes both sweet and savoury. From Coconut Cream to Chipotle &amp; Blue Cheese. You can check out photos of some of our flavours on our website <a href=""http://www.littlecheesecakecompany.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.littlecheesecakecompany.com</a></p>

<p><i>(Hors D'oeuvres size Chocolate Explosion Cheesecakes)</i><br/></p>The Little Cheesecake Company began in 2010 with lots of passion, excitement, and very little budget. This meant lots of firsts and adventures. From buying a 20 year old former military vehicle on e-bay in California and spending the next week on the road trip of our lives - squealing through each curve of the Rocky Mountains, a detour to the Grand Canyon of course, and missing the 4 corners monument operating hours by a matter of minutes, to having the truck exported, then imported all in the same night, one that ended with a border agent, who was, hand-to-God, named ""Reamer"" helping us finally accomplish our goal.<br/><p>I'm here today with another goal. One that I need your help with. If a sufficiently scary man named Reamer, in Detroit, can help me, I'm hopeful that you can too.</p>
<p>People tell me nearly every day that I <i>""have to  go on The Dragon's Den""</i>, or try crowdfunding to get new locations open.... since I cannot stomach the idea of Kevin O'Leary owning a 51% share of my company, I come to you...</p>
<p>If everyone who shares our link, or clicks through contributed just $1, we would be more than halfway to our goal after only 3 days!<br/></p>
<h3>I Need a Kitchen. </h3>
<p>Since the cre<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>ation of The Little Cheesecake Company, I have been renting a kitchen on a day to day basis from a local charitable group. This creates an incredible lack of efficiency due to the need to haul all bake ware, ingredients, completed product, etc... in and out of the location with each visit, and limiting my hours to match those of the organization. Having a dedicated kitchen space to work in, at any hour, would provide me with extra time to focus on product development and expanding our market. <br/></p>
<p>The impact a dedicated kitchen would have is huge. Imagine that every day when you got up to go to work, you  had to empty out your entire closet and refrigerator, bring it all with you, decide what to wear, prepare your meals for the day, then haul it all back at the end of the day, without a wrinkle or speck on it all while observing health and safety standards, not spoiling any food or spilling a drop. <br/></p>
<p>Not fun or practical.<br/></p>
<p>With your help, I can achieve the goal of moving into a 
permanent location. Because of our connections in the industry, we have 
been able to acquire a lot of the commercial equipment that we will need
 to outfit our own kitchen space. Our long term goal is to build a 
kitchen space complete with a cafe in our present truck location, and free up the 
truck to be on-the-road more frequently. <br/></p>
<p>If our campaign allows it, we 
will do it now. If not, we will happily install a shipping container 
kitchen on the property and grind it out until we can achieve our goal.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, we had an unpleasant experience with our ""paint guy"" - of one month overdue and double the estimate sort. This left us with neither time, nor budget to complete the vehicle wrap before our grand opening. To this day, our dark blue former military vehicle lacks all promotional material or branding other than a simple VistaPrint banner that reads ""The Little Cheesecake Co."" affixed with heavy duty magnets. During the winter of 2013 this banner blew away for a couple of months and mysteriously found it's way home in the spring (we bought better magnets). It became a subject of local pride if you knew what that ""big blue wagon by the funeral home"" was for. Location, location, location! <br/></p>
<p>So, yes, signage that can't blow away would be incredibly helpful.</p>

<p>What we would like to offer you in exchange for your support - cheesecakes of course! It's what we do best. Our Cheesecakes have won every dessert and food competition we've ever entered.

From single cakes, to full wedding dessert service, to the Platinum Ticket for Cheesecake for Life, cheesecake Thank-You's will abound!<br/></p>

obtaining permits and inspections, with plenty of obstacles and mistakes

adapt. In the place of our now absent power plant, solar and wind farms 
have popped up. Where tobacco once grew, we now see wineries and 
lavender farms, and small business owners, like me, who have dug in 
their heels for the long haul. We have an amazing local community that 
knows the value of a homegrown mom and pop shop. We strive to continue 
to be one of the many success stories, and aim to pump jobs back into 
our local community.<br/></p>

<p><strong>Meet the Team </strong></p>
<p>Geoff Coderre &amp;  Veronika MacDonald – Geoff and Veronika bring their love and passion of community, customer service, and travel to the Halifax region. Together, they have traveled to over 34 countries while visiting different Nordic spas along with way. Geoff and Veronika had an elaborate wedding planned in Toronto, but cancelled their wedding and decided to elope and sell their house in order to put up the initial investment for Nova Nordique. Geoff Coderre is a partial owner of family-based AKME Appraisals INC and has started several successful companies.  Veronika MacDonald has several years experience serving and in the banking industry as well.</p>
<p>John Mayo and Leanne Wiese share their commitment to the fitness industry.  They practice and are proponents of yoga, meditation, movement, and hot/cold therapy.  John Mayo is the founder of Mayo Bros Calisthenics, he grew their Instagram following to above 53,000 followers and converted this into a successful online coaching platform.  Leanne Wiese is the founder Wiese Moves, whereby she successfully offers in-home personal training and coaching to  clients throughout Halifax.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sales &amp; Marketing:  Social Media, Luxury Magazines, Direct Mail &amp; Print, Influencers, Travel Agencies</strong></p>
<p>Social media including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and Linked In. Check us out @novanordique</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will begin our sales and marketing efforts online using social media ad campaigns targeting local regions in Canada and the US.  After successful regional roll-outs, we will market to all of Canada and the US Northeast.  During this time we plan to build funnels between our Nova Nordique website, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube to acquire a strong brand affinity in the Halifax market area.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to social platforms, we plan to partner with a marketing and public relations firm to create visibility and awareness of the luxury Nova Nordique Facility in Halifax Regional Municipality.  We will have articles in business, travel, and lifestyle magazines featuring Nova Nordique as a premium spa, wellness, and hospitality facility. Due to the specific branding of Nova Nordique, we feel that outsourcing this task will be the most effective means of leveraging our branding identity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Local Marketing consists of direct mail, advertisements, ads in social media, and networking.  We believe in the community and look forward to positively contributing the local economy. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We plan to allocate a large portion of the marketing funds to social ad campaigns beginning locally, then expanding nationwide.  Also, we are partnering with social media influencers to showcase their experience with their online following through Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.  We feel this is a high impact with a low-cost method that will create excitement about Nova Nordique. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We plan to allocate a large portion of the marketing funds to social ad campaigns beginning locally and expanding internationally within the first six months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly, we plan to partner with Travel Agencies, Cruise Ship Companies, and Airlines for layovers.  We will be offering these agencies a percentage commission.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Organizational Plan</strong></p>

Sales & Marketing:  Social Media, Luxury Magazines, Direct Mail & Print, Influencers, Travel Agencies
Social media including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and Linked In. Check us out @novanordique
 
We will begin our sales and marketing efforts online using social media ad campaigns targeting local regions in Canada and the US.  After successful regional roll-outs, we will market to all of Canada and the US Northeast.  During this time we plan to build funnels between our Nova Nordique website, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube to acquire a strong brand affinity in the Halifax market area.
 
In addition to social platforms, we plan to partner with a marketing and public relations firm to create visibility and awareness of the luxury Nova Nordique Facility in Halifax Regional Municipality.  We will have articles in business, travel, and lifestyle magazines featuring Nova Nordique as a premium spa, wellness, and hospitality facility. Due to the specific branding of Nova Nordique, we feel that outsourcing this task will be the most effective means of leveraging our branding identity.
 
Local Marketing consists of direct mail, advertisements, ads in social media, and networking.  We believe in the community and look forward to positively contributing the local economy. 
 
We plan to allocate a large portion of the marketing funds to social ad campaigns beginning locally, then expanding nationwide.  Also, we are partnering with social media influencers to showcase their experience with their online following through Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.  We feel this is a high impact with a low-cost method that will create excitement about Nova Nordique. 
 
We plan to allocate a large portion of the marketing funds to social ad campaigns beginning locally and expanding internationally within the first six months.
 
Lastly, we plan to partner with Travel Agencies, Cruise Ship Companies, and Airlines for layovers.  We will be offering these agencies a percentage commission.
 
Organizational Plan
Senior Management  (We are fun, creative, and determined.);
Center Manager (Organized beyond belief and fabulous with People.);
Administrative Manager (Organized, detail-oriented, and always smiling!);
Customer Service Staff (Upbeat, fun, and friendly.);
Facility Maintenance Staff (Gregarious, detail-oriented, and committed.);
Restaurant/Bar Staff (Customer Service like you have NEVER seen!);
Accountant (Yep, you guessed it…total numbers guru and detail-oriented.);
Administrative Staff (friendly, team players, and committed.). 
Legal and Marketing Staff:  We will outsource our marketing and legal departments with firms specializing in the luxury spa, wellness, and hospitality facilities space.

Such videos made by Red Bull or GoPro are really breathtaking. One day we decided we had to get our own video: of ourselves and of the landscapes we see in our trips. We were planning a trip to the mountains and thought it would be great to return home with a nice video of our travel. We chose to go to a mountain region about 3600 m high. We knew that in the mountains we will face wind and even snow. That’s why we wanted to find a fully autonomous drone, compact enough to be packed in a bag and easily portable, but, at the same time, to be able to work at high altitudes in conditions of low temperatures and strong wind, moving at a speed up to 90 km/h. We were unable to find such a drone and… set out to build a copter meeting all our requirements. Model-makers know too well that at low temperatures batteries either fail immediately or run down very quickly. At the height of 4000 m the atmospheric density is 40% lower that at the sea level. All the above made our goal an engineering challenge. Having vast experience in designing aerospace apparatuses, we chose the way similar to building big planes. After some research we got the target weight of the structure. In order to provide the required weight and durability of the drone we decided to use carbon fabric as the strongest and the lightest material. We built two prototypes. The first one was used to test and choose the necessary equipment; the second one was intended for testing software and flight modes. Simultaneously, we were building our first Atlas ERIDA Gen.A copter. The copter’s design was not just aesthetic, it also helped to reduce air pressure. The camera mounted on the stabilized platform allows to get a video closely approximated to a professional footage. The wind may cause failures of the height sensor, that is why we installed a LIDAR thus enhancing the copter’s movement precision and safety which is vital when shooting in crowded places. To further improve the copter’s safety one can upload maps enabling it to avoid dangerous areas and recognize the location of buildings and other structures. When the tests and trials were successfully completed we packed our creation and took it to the mountains with us. After our trip we realized that we had created a truly worthy apparatus and considered it our duty to share our achievement with others. We slightly changed the design, solved the problems which came out during the usage of the first version and also made some general improvements. We did our best to enable any person, even without any piloting experience, to shoot with ease and get a beautiful footage of his/her activities.</span><br/></p>

The ERIDA drone constantly tracks where you are and follows you automatically keeping the camera on you and captures your every move.


We set out to create the best aerial photography experience you ever imagined. This means the creation of a powerful drone to provide smooth, stable flight dynamics from the moment it takes off. Our drone is also a smart one: it manages the flight in a way that you can retake creative control and focus on getting great videos. People really want great shots and they wish to take them without professional tools. ERIDA enables them to get fabulous videos easily without the need to spend years getting trained as a professional drone pilot.The ERIDA drone has a wide range of features, from manual flight and camera telemetric controls to fully automatic takeoff, flight and landing. Enjoy filming with ERIDA!
