<p><b>Trade Ins:</b></p>
<p>Trade ins have been offered on the web for a while now. You can sell phones, books, and more. But you always see sites offering you less money than you would get if you sold it in online auction. But you don't want to deal with the hassle of online auction.</p>
<p>We decided to bridge the gap by removing the hassle and getting users more bang for your buck. Through our trade in system, users ship directly to us, and they get more than they would on other sites because we don't have to deal with the fees involving cash payouts to users. We just pay our users through AshCash!</p>
<p><b>Refer others:</b></p>
<p>Users can pick up a referral link on their profile page. Rather than have the simple 100 point per referral system, we decided on an exciting new referral system: percentage referrals. Users refer others using their link, and if a user signs up, then every time the new users earns, the user that referred gets a randomly generated 1 - 15% of the AshCash amount the new user earned. This happens on every positive transaction the new user has FOR LIFE.</p>
<p><b>Watch Videos:</b></p>
<p>Users can watch videos to earn marginal AshCash. Our video selection is small, but growing. And our video section is part of one of our stretch goals.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________</p>
<h1>Spend AshCash through...</h1>
<ul>
<li>Our rewards store. Currently has gift cards which allows users to receive rewards quick and easy. Our systems allows us to send gift cards automatically without someone having to send all the codes manually through email. We will be adding more products to our store, some virtual and some physical. AshCash is not simply a tool to get gift cards!</li>
<li>Our lotteries and giveaways. Spend AshCash on our Pick 'em lottery system, which lets users win even more AshCash. Or spend AshCash to enter in giveaways. Giveaway prizes could be as small as gift cards to as large as TVs and even the occasional cruise!</li>
</ul>

<h1>We Need You....</h1>
<p>Our site is currently running locally, and sometimes we have it open on the web. We'll be able to share our URL with you shortly.</p>
<p>We have our SSL certificate already as well as our domain, so all transactions with AshCash are encrypted.</p>
<p>We need to move to a faster, dedicated server. We are currently running on shared hosting for development and testing and it frustrates us sometimes how slow the server is. Sometimes our database is so overloaded that our site is inaccessible. We definitely cannot launch on this hosting. As soon as we reach our goal, we are moving servers and will have the website live for everyone to see the homepage (sign up will still be disabled).</p>
<p>We need to get partners with us because currently the company is two people, me and my mom. And my mom doesn't even do anything. I need a designer because my Photoshop skills are very basic. A fellow PHP and/or HTML5/CSS coder is also necessary.</p>
<p>We have other ideas that will allow users to earn more ""lucratively"", but they require certain assets that we do not have.</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Rewards: New accounts on our site are automatically awarded 100 ASH. If you pledge at least $20, we will make you an account with your desired username. The account will be credited with the amount list in the reward description.</p>
<p>On top of the account, we want to offer inclusive rewards. For example, say you make a $100 pledge. </p>
<p>The rewards you receive are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributor Listing</li>
<li>Be a Beta Tester</li>
<li>Verified Account Status</li>
<li>Account with 42,500 ASH</li>
</ul>
<p>We feel this is the best way to add a lot of value to your contribution. Let us know if you have any further questions regarding rewards, or anything else.</p>
</div><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>First of all, we will have a small budget for advertising even after all of your contributions. Marketing our website and spreading the word will be hard. But we have a strategy in place, and we hope that you guys can help us out on social media to help spread the word.</p><p>None of our services can be patented, which means these methods can (and have been) replicated. We know there are other sites out there with similar services. But at AshNetwork we feel we have the greatest collection of services, and the best ideas for new services that will allow our users to earn.</p><p>Ashwin Rajgopal, the majority owner, is still in high school (class of 2016). He has certain priorities that come before the business, such as college admissions (hopefully you understand). That is one reason why we are trying to bring in more people. The admissions process for Ashwin could be done as early as January, which in that case Ashwin will be back to the business almost full time.</p><p><b>Other Notes to Consider:</b></p><p></p><p>The basic process on AshNetwork:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1354593/files/20150404073421-proc.png?1428158061"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>AshNetwork is the place to earn rewards while surfing the internet. We're working hard to bring you many different ways to earn so you no longer have to deal with annoying internet quirks without being compensated for your troubles. And best of all, AshNetwork provides a 256 bit encryption so your account is safe. AND WE NEVER ASK FOR OR STORE CREDIT CARD NUMBERS ON OUR SITE.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1353317/files/20150403154043-nocc.png?1428100843"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>We are also NOT competitors with your favorite miles-earning credit card or cash back credit card. Use those in tandem with our shopping section!</p><p>We have many ideas on how to expand the business. We don't want to share these ideas, since they may be stolen, but they could very likely be stretch goals. Fund us to let AshNetwork reach its true potential.</p><p>Many current rewards program users deal with expiring points, small selections of rewards, and points dispersed over various accounts. It is unfair to those users who earn so many points to be ill-treated by companies they are buying goods and services from. </p><p>AshNetwork will bring the fairness back to rewards programs by never expiring points, continually adding rewards, and keeping users' hard-earned points in one spot. AshNetwork is always working to bring the next big way for its users to earn, so we are always expanding our market so more consumers can benefit.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1353322/files/20150403154437-expired.png?1428101077"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><i>Note about AshCash: AshCash is a virtual currency created by us.

Users refer others using their link, and if a user signs up, then every time the new users earns, the user that referred gets a randomly generated 1 - 15% of the AshCash amount the new user earned. This happens on every positive transaction the new user has FOR LIFE.
Watch Videos:
Users can watch videos to earn marginal AshCash. Our video selection is small, but growing. And our video section is part of one of our stretch goals.
_________________________________________________________________
Spend AshCash through...

Our rewards store. Currently has gift cards which allows users to receive rewards quick and easy. Our systems allows us to send gift cards automatically without someone having to send all the codes manually through email. We will be adding more products to our store, some virtual and some physical. AshCash is not simply a tool to get gift cards!
Our lotteries and giveaways. Spend AshCash on our Pick 'em lottery system, which lets users win even more AshCash. Or spend AshCash to enter in giveaways. Giveaway prizes could be as small as gift cards to as large as TVs and even the occasional cruise!


Some of our rewards
_________________________________________________________________
We Need You....
Our site is currently running locally, and sometimes we have it open on the web. We'll be able to share our URL with you shortly.
We have our SSL certificate already as well as our domain, so all transactions with AshCash are encrypted.
We need to move to a faster, dedicated server. We are currently running on shared hosting for development and testing and it frustrates us sometimes how slow the server is. Sometimes our database is so overloaded that our site is inaccessible. We definitely cannot launch on this hosting. As soon as we reach our goal, we are moving servers and will have the website live for everyone to see the homepage (sign up will still be disabled).
We need to get partners with us because currently the company is two people, me and my mom. And my mom doesn't even do anything. I need a designer because my Photoshop skills are very basic. A fellow PHP and/or HTML5/CSS coder is also necessary.
We have other ideas that will allow users to earn more ""lucratively"", but they require certain assets that we do not have.
_________________________________________________________________
Rewards: New accounts on our site are automatically awarded 100 ASH. If you pledge at least $20, we will make you an account with your desired username. The account will be credited with the amount list in the reward description.
On top of the account, we want to offer inclusive rewards. For example, say you make a $100 pledge. 
The rewards you receive are:

Contributor Listing
Be a Beta Tester
Verified Account Status
Account with 42,500 ASH

We feel this is the best way to add a lot of value to your contribution. Let us know if you have any further questions regarding rewards, or anything else.
Risks and challengesFirst of all, we will have a small budget for advertising even after all of your contributions. Marketing our website and spreading the word will be hard. But we have a strategy in place, and we hope that you guys can help us out on social media to help spread the word.None of our services can be patented, which means these methods can (and have been) replicated. We know there are other sites out there with similar services. But at AshNetwork we feel we have the greatest collection of services, and the best ideas for new services that will allow our users to earn.Ashwin Rajgopal, the majority owner, is still in high school (class of 2016). He has certain priorities that come before the business, such as college admissions (hopefully you understand). That is one reason why we are trying to bring in more people. The admissions process for Ashwin could be done as early as January, which in that case Ashwin will be back to the business almost full time.Other Notes to Consider:The basic process on AshNetwork:AshNetwork is the place to earn rewards while surfing the internet. We're working hard to bring you many different ways to earn so you no longer have to deal with annoying internet quirks without being compensated for your troubles. And best of all, AshNetwork provides a 256 bit encryption so your account is safe. AND WE NEVER ASK FOR OR STORE CREDIT CARD NUMBERS ON OUR SITE.We are also NOT competitors with your favorite miles-earning credit card or cash back credit card. Use those in tandem with our shopping section!We have many ideas on how to expand the business. We don't want to share these ideas, since they may be stolen, but they could very likely be stretch goals. Fund us to let AshNetwork reach its true potential.Many current rewards program users deal with expiring points, small selections of rewards, and points dispersed over various accounts. It is unfair to those users who earn so many points to be ill-treated by companies they are buying goods and services from. AshNetwork will bring the fairness back to rewards programs by never expiring points, continually adding rewards, and keeping users' hard-earned points in one spot. AshNetwork is always working to bring the next big way for its users to earn, so we are always expanding our market so more consumers can benefit.Note about AshCash: AshCash is a virtual currency created by us. AshCash has no monetary value and cannot currently be exchanged for any real currency (USD, GBP, CAN, etc.) legally. The exchange rate between AshCash and USD is recalculated consistently using a formula we created based on the laws of supply and demand. We're giving you AshCash as a reward, and since gift cards cannot be rewards on Indiegogo, we'll also have some limited edition AshNetwork merchandise and other famous Indiegogo products for backers to redeem with their starter AshCash.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, my name is Joe, and I'd like to thank you for taking a moment to dream with me...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  From an early age I have always dreamed of having my own business. Many times that dream changed, but it always circled back around to what I feel my calling is....a Motel owner. But not just any Motel owner. I have always had an extreme love of the unknown, the unexplained, basically all things that go “bump” in the night. This has pretty much made me the Griswalds of Halloween, and this is where you can help. ￼ </p>
<p>   I crossed off a haunting item on my bucket list in May, 2017 when I stayed at the Clown Motel. I enjoyed it, but must admit, it needs some updating. I hear my calling getting louder, my time is now &amp; I need your help. The infamously mysterious landmark, The Clown Motel has become available. Funds are needed to not only purchase the property, but also do an overhaul to bring it up to date with a bit more wonder around each corner that you won't want to miss.</p>
<p>  However I need to move fast, before my dream turns into a nightmare. If I don't move and act now, there's the chance a big corporate chain could buy it, and dissolve all of it's luster. Let's not allow this iconic haunting landmark slip into the hands of a huge corporation and be turned into a bland, white walled, ordinary Motel 6, Holiday Inn or Best Western. Help me preserve this uniquely haunting hotel for generations to come.</p>
<p> Where will your support go you ask? Updates and renovations would include creating a website to allow online booking &amp; let you know about all haunting events to come. New carpeting, beds, linens, and upgrading to a new key card system. Major sponsor's will receive a haunting surprise!</p>
<p>￼    If you are unable to contribute monetarily, you can still help out by getting the word out there. Share this campaign with all of your friends and family on your Social Media pages using the Indiegogo sharing options and tools. </p>
<p>   Supporting my dream you get to be part of a haunting history and ensuring that the Clown Motel is around for years to come. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart, I truly hope WE can make this dream a reality. Hope to see you soon at The Clown Motel￼!</p>

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>The New York Musician's Center (NYMC) was launched with the fundamental goal of providing kids with a place to develop their love of music, and grow as both musicians and leaders within their community.  We teach private music lessons to over 500 kids each week but want to spread the music to deserving kids who simply lack the finances and resources. That's where our Keys for Kids Program and <strong><u>you</u></strong> can help!</p>
<ul>
<li>This campaign is to provide 100 at-risk kids with private music instruction, instruments, and performance opportunities.</li>
<li>Having as many contributions as possible will help us teach 100 or more kids within the tri-state area of New York and provide them with the resources to learn, play and thrive in their community! </li>
</ul>
<p>The Keys for Kids project is a challenge to the lack of access to music education that children around the United States face everyday.  100 kids will be accepted into the program based on demonstration of financial need, or recommendation from their school or church.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds will be used in 3 ways:<br/><br/>1) BRING MUSIC INSTRUCTION TO 100 AT-RISK CHILDREN<br/><br/>$54k would be used to pay instructional staff for a total of 4,800 lessons taught throughout the year. We hope to enroll 100 students in the New York Musician’s Center's Keys 4 Kids program so that kids from around New York's tri-state area can take lessons at our studio or through online instruction. Students who live outside of our area will be able to take weekly lessons and even participate in our performance experiences through online streaming!</p>
<p>2) PROVIDE INSTRUMENTS <br/><br/>$13,000 will be dedicated to providing instruments to all participants.  We plan to use the funds to put instruments in the hands of each of these at-risk children who are taking lessons so that they may use it during their lesson and to practice on their own.  Instruments that we will be providing include guitars, keyboards, violins, violas, cellos and drum pads.<br/><br/>3) PROVIDE  RECITAL EXPERIENCES<br/> <br/>$2,000 of your funds would provide these kids with at least 2 recital opportunities in New York during 2019.  Students who are unable to travel will be provided with technology to perform via live streaming. Many kids these days never experience the incredible feeling of walking onto a stage or the courage that is needed to perform in front of hundreds of people. It's experiences like this that teach our children how to cope with anxiety, overcome fear, and see how their dedication pays off.  </p>

<p><strong>The Wild Roast Cafe</strong></p>
<p><strong>A great coffee shop is integral to any community.</strong> My family is bringing one to the Bluff Park neighborhood in Hoover, Alabama. We invite you to become part of this journey.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We have worked in Hoover/Bluff Park for the past seven years and fell in love with it so much that we moved here.</strong> But we have also been frustrated by the lack of options close to home when we want to go somewhere and read a book, work remotely, or visit with friends.</li>
<li>
<strong>While this will be our family business, this is YOUR community.</strong> So help us make it special.</li>
<li>
<strong>We are moving out of the first phase of launching our coffee shop.</strong> We have started an LLC, developed a business plan, worked with an architect, identified our contractors, selected our equipment, created our house blend, and submitted plans for approval by the city and county. We are now moving into the build-out phase. We have an incredible space and location. But it was not designed for this purpose. That means we are adding new electrical and plumbing to support the use of power and water that are necessary for a coffee shop. Because we want this place to reflect our community, your sponsorship will give us wider options as we select the final flooring, paint, tile, counter tops, etc. Plus, our coffee shop will have a very intentional focus on art and music. Your sponsorship will help us quickly move to incorporate these elements into your experience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We're not a big corporate chain opening a franchise.</strong> We are a family who loves coffee and loves this community. Our children go to school around the corner. We live less than two miles away. Our focus won't be on the stock portfolio of someone across the country who has never even heard of Bluff Park. Our focus will be on the quality of coffee in your cup, the comfort of the chair you choose to sit in, paying our neighbor who provides the art on the wall, and promoting the middle-class musician who includes us on her tour. When you love your experience or when you have a suggestion for making it better, you will be talking to the owners: US! Since we don't have a big corporate structure behind us, creating our business must come from our own finances...and from our community.</li>
<li>
<strong>Your sponsorship comes with some cool perks.</strong> You can earn free cups of coffee (all the way from one on up to a year's supply!), stickers for your vehicle, mugs, shirts, and even a night with the cafe all to yourself so you can throw a party for your friends.</li>
<li>
<strong>Any level of support will be appreciated and useful.</strong> So if we don't reach our goal, we will prioritize some of the pieces we were hoping to add and make some tough choices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Here's what this will mean to our family:</strong> Opening our business means that we will be able to spend more time together. I know that sounds crazy, right? But with careers in corporate retail and camping/student ministry, our schedules have almost never matched up. There are very few days out of the year when all five of us are together. We will be able to work side by side and have our children walk over and do homework after school. And that's something that you just can't put a dollar amount on. No one will work harder to make sure you have a great coffee shop because we will be investing so much of ourselves into it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Here's what this will mean to you:</strong> You gain a great local, independent coffee shop! Bluff Park is widely regarded as one of the best neighborhoods in the Birmingham area. And while we have some phenomenal small businesses and local restaurants, what we don't have is a place with enough seating to spread out and sit for a while. We want you to pick up a cup on your way to the office or chat with a friend after dropping off your kids at school. Use our free wifi to work remotely or meet with a client. After school, we will have a kids-friendly area with activities and enough square footage for you to sit somewhere else and have a conversation. On the weekend, ride your bike over or stop by after a run along Park Avenue or a hike in Moss Rock. Swing by to pick up a unique and meaningful gift for a loved one. Take a cup outside and watch the sunset over the Bluff. This is YOUR neighborhood coffee shop.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>So where does the money raised through crowdfunding go?</strong> So much has already been accomplished but there is a lot left to do. Our plumber will be drilling through concrete to create new drains for the additional sinks and and machines. The electrician will be making sure we have enough power to run all of the equipment at peak hours. Through all of this, we are adding in wall paint, flooring, lighting, and furniture that are comfortable and maintain a great sound quality for your conversations and also for live entertainment. Each of these pieces has a value...and a cost. We know the pieces that we can put off, if necessary. But our goal is to have everything 100% just the way that we want it, and the way that you deserve it, on opening day.</li>
<li>
<strong>So why trust us to make it happen?</strong> First, we love coffee. Second, we love the community. But third, we have a track record of making big things happen. Our backgrounds include managing a summer camping program of 1,500 campers, running an 18,000 sq ft retail store with $4.5 million in sales and much, much more - all with a focus on exceptional customer experience. To help us along the way, we are being advised by the Small Business Development Center of Alabama and have been receiving coaching from two of Birmingham's best coffee shops.</li>

<strong>Let other folks know about our coffee shop.</strong> Email us any leads to bart@wildroastcafe.com and encourage friends and family who grew up here but have moved away to contribute. We will be here when they visit and y'all want to meet and catch up!</li>

<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
<p>We're launching the next generation of the Vermont Liberty Tea Company! This past summer the shop closed its doors when John McConnell retired after nearly two decades in business serving the Waterbury, VT community. Now we're trying to launch the next generation of the shop, and we're not settling until we build something everyone can be proud of. <strong>Here's what that means:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We've already moved Heaven and Earth to <strong><a href=""http://www.vtlibertyteacompany.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">relaunch the website</a></strong>
</li>
<li>We're taking a digital-first approach until we can open a new retail location in the coming months</li>
<li>We're depending on you to keep the dream of a small tea shop serving the Vermont community alive. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><b>Here's where your donation goes:</b></span></span></p>
<p><font>You enable us to do a ton when you donate that directly impacts the tea you buy! </font>The $25,000 goal isn't arbitrary. It's where we've landed on making sure we can provide the best possible level of service to the community.</p>
<p>The biggest goal of the Vermont Liberty Tea Company’s crowdfunding campaign is to re-establish the company in a long-lasting, meaningful way. An enormous part of that means getting an infusion of capital from the real investors – <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p>Tea lovers and enthusiasts turn to Vermont Liberty for its history of providing an incredible value and service. <strong>That isn’t built overnight</strong>, and we don’t want to take a single step backward.</p>
<p>A successful crowdfunding campaign will allow us to increase the word-of-mouth about the store and to build marketing efforts, get seen by a wider audience, and be able to make a more thorough transition in the next generation of the business. The snowball effect is enormous and measurable.</p>
<p><strong>Things get more cost-efficient</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much everyone knows that buying in bulk is far, far more cost efficient than the alternative. A big part of running a tea business is being able to make bulk purchases of tea all at once instead of more expensive 1-off orders. <strong>The economics are simple:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1: 2 pounds of tea can cost $50 or $60 to purchase.</li>
<li>Option 2: 35 pounds of the same tea can cost $250 - $275 to purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a business, this breaks down as... </p>
<ul>
<li>Option 1 means Vermont Liberty pays $25 - $30 per pound of tea</li>
<li>Option 2 means Vermont Liberty pays $7 - $8 per pound of tea</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see how we benefit by getting an infusion like this. Buying in bulk and providing a cost efficient tea to our customers means we keep costs down, and <strong><i><u>YOU</u></i></strong> pay less. A lot less. Seriously, less.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>A small business grows, grows, and grows</strong></p>
<p>Small businesses make the world turn. Or at least, they make Vermont thrive.  Firms with less than 20 workers make up the vast majority of businesses (<a href=""http://sbecouncil.org/about-us/facts-and-data/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SBE Council, 2014</a>). Depending on who you ask, small businesses make up 45%-50% of the US economy's GDP. <strong>In Vermont it's a different story. </strong>96% of businesses are small businesses and it makes up 60% of the economy (<a href=""https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/vt12.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VT SBA</a>). <strong>These numbers are AWESOME</strong> and we want to do our part to make sure we can play a role in that. Does that make us a statistic? Yeah, but it's a statistic that helps beat back the influence of massive corporations that extract money from local communities. This is a business for the community.</p>
<p><strong>Crowdfunding allows us to avoid expensive bank loans</strong></p>
<p>Getting a loans offer short-term fixes with long-term interest. While it would benefit any business right off the bat, Vermont Liberty and its customers would be better served avoiding having to raise prices to pay back the loan, the interest, and the associated interest.</p>
<p><strong>Crowdfunding allows us to grow</strong></p>
<p>This funding route may not be the only one available, but it allows us to visibly grow. While the Vermont Liberty Tea Company could continue with its status quo without a strong showing on Indiegogo, it allows us to get so much done without the need to bootstrap the future or go into debt. <strong>We have no intention of drowning. We have every intention of catching fire.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Communities love small businesses. People love small businesses. Small businesses fail, and fail often. We mentioned earlier that we could bootstrap this business without a great need for more capital, but there's an incredible difference between the ""haves"" and the ""have-nots"" -- these differences drive people, businesses, families, and communities into the ground. </p>
<p>We feel confident that given time and enthusiasm, we could bootstrap this business without any outside help. The cost of that would most certainly harm our ability to serve tea and to serve a community that loves our product.</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to ask for your contribution and to give back in the process. We have a few high-dollar perks, but we want this campaign to be accessible to everyone. $10 for a custom tea is our lowest ""perk"", but we're flexible on everything. If you can only give a dollar, that dollar means the world to us.</li>
<li>Making tea itself accessible to everyone in bulk is something we've spent a great deal of time thinking about, but don't have the resources to pull off. If you want to talk more about making tea a more accessible beverage option in poor households and communities, get in touch, because it's a challenge with solutions that don't <i>need</i> to be a burden.</li>
<li>Change is hard. We're asking people to make a financial contribution to a business. Transparency in this case means we're out to make a buck (okay, a lot of bucks), but transparency in this case means we want your to benefit. <strong>Your donation of $5, $25, $50, or whatever you can afford to give will make sure we have the cushion we need to kick this off right.</strong>

We're launching the next generation of the Vermont Liberty Tea Company! This past summer the shop closed its doors when John McConnell retired after nearly two decades in business serving the Waterbury, VT community. Now we're trying to launch the next generation of the shop, and we're not settling until we build something everyone can be proud of. Here's what that means:

We've already moved Heaven and Earth to relaunch the website

We're taking a digital-first approach until we can open a new retail location in the coming months
We're depending on you to keep the dream of a small tea shop serving the Vermont community alive. 

Here's where your donation goes:
You enable us to do a ton when you donate that directly impacts the tea you buy! The $25,000 goal isn't arbitrary. It's where we've landed on making sure we can provide the best possible level of service to the community.
The biggest goal of the Vermont Liberty Tea Company’s crowdfunding campaign is to re-establish the company in a long-lasting, meaningful way. An enormous part of that means getting an infusion of capital from the real investors – you.
Tea lovers and enthusiasts turn to Vermont Liberty for its history of providing an incredible value and service. That isn’t built overnight, and we don’t want to take a single step backward.
A successful crowdfunding campaign will allow us to increase the word-of-mouth about the store and to build marketing efforts, get seen by a wider audience, and be able to make a more thorough transition in the next generation of the business. The snowball effect is enormous and measurable.
Things get more cost-efficient
Pretty much everyone knows that buying in bulk is far, far more cost efficient than the alternative. A big part of running a tea business is being able to make bulk purchases of tea all at once instead of more expensive 1-off orders. The economics are simple:

Option 1: 2 pounds of tea can cost $50 or $60 to purchase.
Option 2: 35 pounds of the same tea can cost $250 - $275 to purchase.

For a business, this breaks down as... 

Option 1 means Vermont Liberty pays $25 - $30 per pound of tea
Option 2 means Vermont Liberty pays $7 - $8 per pound of tea

You can see how we benefit by getting an infusion like this. Buying in bulk and providing a cost efficient tea to our customers means we keep costs down, and YOU pay less. A lot less. Seriously, less.

It's my wish to merge all these passions together to make sure that hikers will have the same 800+ mile Arizona Trail for decades to come, a future that's not yet guaranteed.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452055276/mdgst8rfzxnyuybwargy.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/><br style=""background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p>Currently, portions of the Arizona Trail are in potential danger of being altered for mining and other potential uses that would devastate and harm the landscape. My goal is to use my photography to document the incredible beauty found along the trail and highlight the dramatic scenery found throughout its duration. Working with the <a href=""http://www.aztrail.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arizona Trail Association (ATA)</a>, I'll capture the scenic diversity and resources that line the 800+ miles of the trail to hopefully preserve its scenic resources for good. The ATA will also have full access to the photos taken so that they can use them to their advantage to promote the scenic resources against such threats.</p>
<p>Hiking this trail has been a dream of mine since I first heard about it in 2007 while living in Arizona, and now feels like the perfect time for it all to come together to finally make this dream come true. I'd like your help to that happen and to make sure everyone else with a similar dream gets to hike the same trail. After all, the less the ATA has to work to protect the trail, the more they can focus on maintaining it (like the stretch in the Mazatzals, for example).</p> </div> <div> <h2>The <i>Actual</i> Amount Needed</h2> <p>To complete the trail, I'm predicting I'll need about $3000 total, with about $2300 of that for food and any other trail expenses based on past experience and research from others' information who have successfully completed it. In addition to that, I'll use what is needed to get to Arizona, hike the trail, and then get home once I've completed the hike. Any remaining difference will be donated back to the Arizona Trail Association to help further their efforts.</p>
<p><b>The Breakdown</b></p>
<p>$2380: Trail expenses:<br/>- mailing food/resupplies<br/>- new shoes/clothes after wearing out originals<br/>- occasional bed/shower<br/>- more food/resupplies<br/>- zero days (a day of relaxing)<br/>- national park permits<br/>- shuttles<br/>- real meals when opportunity strikes</p>

<h2>What's At Risk?</h2>
<div>The Center for Biological Diversity  just released what is <a href=""http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/news/press_releases/2016/jaguar-02-03-2016.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the only footage of the ONE known jaguar</a> in the entire United States. The AZT passes right through its habitat where a Canadian company is trying to completely destroy by setting up an open-pit copper mine full of toxic chemicals. The impact to the trail and this jaguar's habitat would be catastrophic. This is just one example why the ATA desperately needs good photos to protect these areas.</div>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Many of you may notice that I have already attempted the Arizona Trail last year, but only completed 164 miles before leaving prematurely. There were some incredibly valuable lessons learned last year and mistakes I would be foolish to repeat. In the end, I already feel much more prepared and ready to get on the trail than I was last year, however if you'd like me to elaborate, please get in touch (Mike@FreeRoamingPhotography.com) and I'll answer any questions you have.</p>
<p>At no point during the hike was there anything more than an expected amount of physical stress. Blisters and a bit of soreness were the only physical impairments I suffered, and I expect my body to carry me the entire length, as it has wonderfully in all my epic hiking adventures. Physical health was the least of my problems last year, and I'm the type of person to see something through to the end if I start it. ...even if it takes a year.</p>
<p>(Note: I will be starting from the beginning again.)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452055409/ck0t9eli4ecfzlmn7ffb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<h2>More Ways to Help</h2>
<p>Want to help but don't have money? I can always use food! Food can either be mailed ahead while I'm on the trail, or if you're nearby the trail, water is precious and I will happily accept any and all cached water wherever possible!</p>
<p>I'll appreciate any food thrown my way, but what I could use the most of are organic pop-tarts, Chapul cricket bars, Kate's Real Food bars, Clif bars, and Justin's (chocolate) nut butters, as well as anything else similar that could break up that pattern. I won't be bringing a stove so that I can save on weight and water, so please nothing that requires cooking.</p>
<p>If you're not able to help out financially or with food or water, spread this around to people you think might enjoy it! Thank you!</p>
<h2>Why the Arizona Trail?</h2>
<div>I lived in Arizona from 2004-2008. It was during that time that the natural beauty of the state helped me grow from an indoor video game addict to a passionate nature enthusiast, among other ways. I want to help return the favor by documenting the Arizona Trail properly through photos that do the landscapes justice. Ideally, this will allow the surrounding areas to bring the same joy and amazement they've brought to me.</div>
<div>Most of the existing photos used to promote and protect the trail were taken either from cell phones or point and shoot cameras, and so few, if any, have the professional quality needed to give the trail its broader reach and inspiration. This makes conserving the scenic resources along the trail extra challenging. By hiking the trail in its entirety and donating the photos to the Arizona Trail Association, I'll be able to change that so that the trail is preserved as is for generations to come.</div>

</div></div>","The Story My name is Mike Cavaroc, an award-winning nature photographer with a passion for hiking and preservation of the natural world. It's my wish to merge all these passions together to make sure that hikers will have the same 800+ mile Arizona Trail for decades to come, a future that's not yet guaranteed.
Currently, portions of the Arizona Trail are in potential danger of being altered for mining and other potential uses that would devastate and harm the landscape. My goal is to use my photography to document the incredible beauty found along the trail and highlight the dramatic scenery found throughout its duration. Working with the Arizona Trail Association (ATA), I'll capture the scenic diversity and resources that line the 800+ miles of the trail to hopefully preserve its scenic resources for good. The ATA will also have full access to the photos taken so that they can use them to their advantage to promote the scenic resources against such threats.
Hiking this trail has been a dream of mine since I first heard about it in 2007 while living in Arizona, and now feels like the perfect time for it all to come together to finally make this dream come true. I'd like your help to that happen and to make sure everyone else with a similar dream gets to hike the same trail. After all, the less the ATA has to work to protect the trail, the more they can focus on maintaining it (like the stretch in the Mazatzals, for example).   The Actual Amount Needed To complete the trail, I'm predicting I'll need about $3000 total, with about $2300 of that for food and any other trail expenses based on past experience and research from others' information who have successfully completed it. In addition to that, I'll use what is needed to get to Arizona, hike the trail, and then get home once I've completed the hike. Any remaining difference will be donated back to the Arizona Trail Association to help further their efforts.
The Breakdown
$2380: Trail expenses:- mailing food/resupplies- new shoes/clothes after wearing out originals- occasional bed/shower- more food/resupplies- zero days (a day of relaxing)- national park permits- shuttles- real meals when opportunity strikes

$350: Perk fulfillment$270: Indiegogo fees
After the campaign started, I was able to arrange it so that rent will not be necessary. The total can now be cut in half as reflected in The Breakdown above!



What's At Risk?
The Center for Biological Diversity  just released what is the only footage of the ONE known jaguar in the entire United States. The AZT passes right through its habitat where a Canadian company is trying to completely destroy by setting up an open-pit copper mine full of toxic chemicals. The impact to the trail and this jaguar's habitat would be catastrophic. This is just one example why the ATA desperately needs good photos to protect these areas.
Risks & Challenges
Many of you may notice that I have already attempted the Arizona Trail last year, but only completed 164 miles before leaving prematurely. There were some incredibly valuable lessons learned last year and mistakes I would be foolish to repeat. In the end, I already feel much more prepared and ready to get on the trail than I was last year, however if you'd like me to elaborate, please get in touch (Mike@FreeRoamingPhotography.com) and I'll answer any questions you have.
At no point during the hike was there anything more than an expected amount of physical stress. Blisters and a bit of soreness were the only physical impairments I suffered, and I expect my body to carry me the entire length, as it has wonderfully in all my epic hiking adventures. Physical health was the least of my problems last year, and I'm the type of person to see something through to the end if I start it. ...even if it takes a year.
(Note: I will be starting from the beginning again.)

More Ways to Help
Want to help but don't have money? I can always use food! Food can either be mailed ahead while I'm on the trail, or if you're nearby the trail, water is precious and I will happily accept any and all cached water wherever possible!
I'll appreciate any food thrown my way, but what I could use the most of are organic pop-tarts, Chapul cricket bars, Kate's Real Food bars, Clif bars, and Justin's (chocolate) nut butters, as well as anything else similar that could break up that pattern. I won't be bringing a stove so that I can save on weight and water, so please nothing that requires cooking.
If you're not able to help out financially or with food or water, spread this around to people you think might enjoy it! Thank you!
Why the Arizona Trail?
I lived in Arizona from 2004-2008. It was during that time that the natural beauty of the state helped me grow from an indoor video game addict to a passionate nature enthusiast, among other ways. I want to help return the favor by documenting the Arizona Trail properly through photos that do the landscapes justice. Ideally, this will allow the surrounding areas to bring the same joy and amazement they've brought to me.
Most of the existing photos used to promote and protect the trail were taken either from cell phones or point and shoot cameras, and so few, if any, have the professional quality needed to give the trail its broader reach and inspiration. This makes conserving the scenic resources along the trail extra challenging. By hiking the trail in its entirety and donating the photos to the Arizona Trail Association, I'll be able to change that so that the trail is preserved as is for generations to come.

This is my honest story of despair, hopelessness, self-loathing, guilt, shame and finally an awakening, a realization that my life could no longer continue on its current path and if I could make it through I would dedicate myself to giving back to those that are still in recovery.   <br/><br/> I was lost in the proverbial bottle.  My world no longer revolved around the daily activities that other “normal” people enjoyed; quality time with family and friends, walking your dog, exercising, gardening, painting or any other hobby that people look to for peace, relaxation and joy.  I was indeed a joyless soul.  All my interests were thrown to the wayside and replaced with a small airplane bottle of distilled spirits.  I was a shell of the person I once was and the worst part was…I knew it. <br/><br/>I battled alcoholism for most of my twenties when finally realizing, at the age of 27 that I needed help.  That help came from family, friends, medical professionals, perfect strangers I met on soberrecovery.com and finally from my books and cycling.  I have always loved to read but during my early recovery I often looked to them for inspiration, education, hope, empathy and most importantly to occupy my mind.  An idle mind early on in ones sobriety is very dangerous and through reading I passed those difficult days without issue.  Another important aspect of my sober life is the sport of cycling.  I do it religiously every day with the help of a great coach who has become a close friend and continues to support me and my sobriety to this day.   Without my family, books and cycling I wouldn't be where I am today.<br/><br/>I began selling books in 2014 after almost 1.5 years of sobriety.  My motivation was never higher, everyday was a gift; filling each one with positive thoughts and lots of hard work.  I have now gotten to the point where I can now give back and fulfill that promise I made to myself all those years ago.  </p><p>The initial idea was not clear to me but I knew I wanted to make a difference in some way and as I grew my book business I knew it would be a major part of it.  Only very recently did it occur to me what I wanted to do. Literally within the past few days, I had a fateful interaction with someone I was able to help through my book business, who was currently recovering and looking for help finding a job.  I thought to myself, ""I have a ton of books on interviewing and finding the perfect job"", so I sent this person, who I knew nothing about really, other than their post on a forum, 3 books for free.  He was so grateful and appreciative but the feeling I had was just as profound; it got me thinking.  </p><p>What if I could provide free books to those currently in alcohol recovery?  Perhaps they love to read but can't afford them, perhaps they dont know how to read and want to learn, perhaps those books will get them through those difficult times like they did for me?  Those in recovery are often depressed, guilt ridden, and feel like the world is against them, but through giving I can offer a small glimmer of hope to those currently suffering.  </p><p>I am looking to partner with recovery facilities around the country but like anything one has to start small and grow from there, just like I did with the book business.  I will begin with my home state of NJ and expand from there.  I want Wares of The Coast to be apart of a patients entrance into a facility.  Just as they are required to fill out entrance forms, they should also be given the option to select a free book for them to read during their time in treatment.  In order to do this I will need more inventory, more shipping supplies and at some point staff to manage this all.<br/><br/>The monetary goal will allow me to purchase more inventory, shipping supplies i.e. mailers, shipping labels  and to allocate a dedicated space to store all the books for this project.  They will need to be segregated from my main inventory and tagged with a barcode so I can locate them without the aid of amazons packing slips.  I plan on sending the treatment facilities a book list which they can give the newcomers, so they can select a book for their stay in treatment.  The books will be given unique seller sku that will also be tagged on the back of the book with a sticky.  This will allow me to locate them in inventory quickly. The cost of monthly storage is about $250 a month for a 10x20 foot space, not including the industrial racks I need to buy that will hold the books. This entire process will also take away from my money producing side of the business which is crucial to keep everything running smoothly.  The donations will pay for the storage fees, and inventory until I can get a steady flow of donations to the project.</p><p>If you, a friend or a family member has struggled with alcoholism and is now sober or if you know someone close to you who lost their battle with alcohol, you have the opportunity to give back, and help someone who wants to live a fulfilling joyous life. Give them hope through books!   Every little bit helps as well.  When the monetary goal is reached we will begin sourcing the inventory and making arrangements for storage.  In the mean time I will be working through the contact process with the facilities.  I will be updating frequently as things develop and also plan on adding a video  as well as additional monetary perks.  Any contributions prior to the perks being posted will be given  those benefits retroactively.  </p><p><br/></p><p>Website Link:  <a href=""http://booksforrecovery.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://booksforrecovery.org/</a></p><p>Here is a link to the Amazon store<a href=""http://amzn.to/1PU1xm6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://amzn.to/1PU1xm6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://amzn.to/1PU1xm6</a> and  positive feedback -&gt;<a href=""http://amzn.to/20ER3c1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://amzn.to/20ER3c1</a></p><p><br/><br/><br/>Best Wishes and Thank You!<br/><br/><br/>Matthew<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Some feedback from my Amazon account-</p><p><br/></p><p>""Beyond professional.

This is my honest story of despair, hopelessness, self-loathing, guilt, shame and finally an awakening, a realization that my life could no longer continue on its current path and if I could make it through I would dedicate myself to giving back to those that are still in recovery.    I was lost in the proverbial bottle.  My world no longer revolved around the daily activities that other “normal” people enjoyed; quality time with family and friends, walking your dog, exercising, gardening, painting or any other hobby that people look to for peace, relaxation and joy.  I was indeed a joyless soul.  All my interests were thrown to the wayside and replaced with a small airplane bottle of distilled spirits.  I was a shell of the person I once was and the worst part was…I knew it. I battled alcoholism for most of my twenties when finally realizing, at the age of 27 that I needed help.  That help came from family, friends, medical professionals, perfect strangers I met on soberrecovery.com and finally from my books and cycling.  I have always loved to read but during my early recovery I often looked to them for inspiration, education, hope, empathy and most importantly to occupy my mind.  An idle mind early on in ones sobriety is very dangerous and through reading I passed those difficult days without issue.  Another important aspect of my sober life is the sport of cycling.  I do it religiously every day with the help of a great coach who has become a close friend and continues to support me and my sobriety to this day.   Without my family, books and cycling I wouldn't be where I am today.I began selling books in 2014 after almost 1.5 years of sobriety.  My motivation was never higher, everyday was a gift; filling each one with positive thoughts and lots of hard work.  I have now gotten to the point where I can now give back and fulfill that promise I made to myself all those years ago.  The initial idea was not clear to me but I knew I wanted to make a difference in some way and as I grew my book business I knew it would be a major part of it.  Only very recently did it occur to me what I wanted to do. Literally within the past few days, I had a fateful interaction with someone I was able to help through my book business, who was currently recovering and looking for help finding a job.  I thought to myself, ""I have a ton of books on interviewing and finding the perfect job"", so I sent this person, who I knew nothing about really, other than their post on a forum, 3 books for free.  He was so grateful and appreciative but the feeling I had was just as profound; it got me thinking.  What if I could provide free books to those currently in alcohol recovery?  Perhaps they love to read but can't afford them, perhaps they dont know how to read and want to learn, perhaps those books will get them through those difficult times like they did for me?  Those in recovery are often depressed, guilt ridden, and feel like the world is against them, but through giving I can offer a small glimmer of hope to those currently suffering.  I am looking to partner with recovery facilities around the country but like anything one has to start small and grow from there, just like I did with the book business.  I will begin with my home state of NJ and expand from there.  I want Wares of The Coast to be apart of a patients entrance into a facility.  Just as they are required to fill out entrance forms, they should also be given the option to select a free book for them to read during their time in treatment.  In order to do this I will need more inventory, more shipping supplies and at some point staff to manage this all.The monetary goal will allow me to purchase more inventory, shipping supplies i.e. mailers, shipping labels  and to allocate a dedicated space to store all the books for this project.  They will need to be segregated from my main inventory and tagged with a barcode so I can locate them without the aid of amazons packing slips.  I plan on sending the treatment facilities a book list which they can give the newcomers, so they can select a book for their stay in treatment.  The books will be given unique seller sku that will also be tagged on the back of the book with a sticky.  This will allow me to locate them in inventory quickly. The cost of monthly storage is about $250 a month for a 10x20 foot space, not including the industrial racks I need to buy that will hold the books. This entire process will also take away from my money producing side of the business which is crucial to keep everything running smoothly.  The donations will pay for the storage fees, and inventory until I can get a steady flow of donations to the project.If you, a friend or a family member has struggled with alcoholism and is now sober or if you know someone close to you who lost their battle with alcohol, you have the opportunity to give back, and help someone who wants to live a fulfilling joyous life. Give them hope through books!   Every little bit helps as well.  When the monetary goal is reached we will begin sourcing the inventory and making arrangements for storage.  In the mean time I will be working through the contact process with the facilities.  I will be updating frequently as things develop and also plan on adding a video  as well as additional monetary perks.  Any contributions prior to the perks being posted will be given  those benefits retroactively.  Website Link:  http://booksforrecovery.org/Here is a link to the Amazon storehttp://amzn.to/1PU1xm6 and  positive feedback ->http://amzn.to/20ER3c1Best Wishes and Thank You!MatthewSome feedback from my Amazon account-""Beyond professional.

Animo Verb, Latin, Pronounced ah-ni-moh - I inspire/animate


We believe that the main focus of business should extend beyond mere profit.  There are millions of responsible brands and retailers across the globe and in your own backyard that you never knew did so many great things.  From lowering their environmental impact, to providing exceptional benefits, wages and perks, to volunteering and donating significant portions of their time and profits, these good businesses deserve our support.  


When we decide to Purchase with Purpose, we can be sure that our everyday purchases will help bring about social and environmental change, and will play a part in reshaping how business in done for the better.  


The Animo Platform

Think of Animo as a Yelp for responsible businesses, but instead of rating food and atmosphere, we look at how businesses treat their employees, the community and environment.  We also decided to take things a step further.  With Animo, we want customers to be able to engage with businesses on a deeper level by actually seeing how these businesses are helping our world.  
Story telling through video, pictures, and written pieces will play a big role in every user's experience.  We believe that knowing why a business does the good things it does is just as important as the what and how.  
Social media integration will also give businesses the opportunity to post relevant content on their profiles that users can like, follow, and share just like many other popular social media platforms.  


Lastly, Animo is completely focused on featuring the positive things in life.  There's seldom a moment that goes by where you don't run into some sort of negative or depressing story.  We understand that bad things happen, but would rather highlight the good things in an attempt to inspire others to take action and do good themselves.  Animo literally means ""I inspire.""  Let's inspire positive change together!

How We Got Here
Several years ago, my wife and I made a commitment to purchase from businesses that supported a cause, were sustainable, or helped an underserved population.  We realized that with the exception of your really popular cause based brands like TOMS shoes, Warby Parker eyewear, and Full Circle Exchange, it was difficult and sometimes time consuming to identify what other businesses were out there doing good things.  
After a great deal of research we realized that there wasn't a consumer centric platform that allowed potential customers to easily identify and locate good businesses locally and nationally.  Thats when we decided to make one.  
A Little About the Founders

<b><h3>Zing Airlines is the bold idea of connecting Canada in a point-to-point fashion with the small and nimble Bombardier CSeries.  </h3>
<br/>Problem</b><div>
<br/>Until recently, flying small numbers of people (100±20) over long distances was an uneconomical proposition. Smaller planes either lacked the range or comfort while larger planes were simply too large or heavy for the mission. <br/><br/>Canada is an extremely challenging market defined by small population centres separated by vast distances. As a result, travellers between secondary cities within Canada currently face multiple connecting flights and long travel times.     <div>
<br/><div>Long travel times have kept many Canadian cities and families isolated and separated from each other for far too long and <i>this issue needed to be fixed.</i>
</div>
<div><i><br/></i></div>
<div>
<b>Solution</b><br/><br/>What is needed is a small and nimble plane capable of travelling vast distances economically and comfortably, that plane is the Canadian built Bombardier CS100.<br/><br/>The CS100 flies further than any regional jet while operating profitably on routes that Boeing and Airbus aircraft are simply too heavy or large for the mission.</div>
<div>Opening up new routes will significantly slashing travel times across Canada. </div>
<div>For an example, Click <a href=""https://www.google.ca/flights/#search;f=YQM;t=YVR;d=2016-01-02;r=2016-01-12;q=moncton+vancouver+flights"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to see how painful it is currently. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445447797/mu47j8ulfuxfjx3qooon.png"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/>

<br/>The CS100 has the potential to open up new routes, increase frequencies and also turn seasonal flights into all year long flights.  <br/><br/>Both major Canadian airlines have invested in foreign made planes that fulfil an outdated vision.

<br/><b>FAQ
</b>
</div>
<div>
<b>
</b><p><b>Why social media and crowd funding? </b></p>
<p>Social media educates the public on what is possible. It highlights an
issue and solution that many Canadians have faced and had trouble articulating. </p>
<p>An educated public will be able to support this venture via crowd
funding.</p>
<p><b><i>An educated public will never be satisfied with the current set up of air travel now that they know what is possible.</i></b></p>
<p>By having this idea go viral, we will get the attention of
politicians, potential investors and other key players necessary to make this
happen.</p>
<p><i><b>Successful crowd funding here is a vote for connecting Canadian communities, protecting Canadian jobs and reuniting friends and families.</b></i></p>
<p><b>What will the funds be used for?</b></p>
<p>Funds raised here will be used to pay for the initial and
non-recurring cost of setting up an airline. The costs are mainly business
development and passing all legal requirements and certification.  </p>
<p>Once this milestone are accomplished, Zing Airlines will be in a
position to raise funds on the capital market for our 2<sup>nd</sup> and last
round of funding. This final round of funding shall give us the means to start
our airline by the 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter of 2017.</p>
<p><b>What if your goal is not reached?</b></p>
<p>The idea of Zing Airlines challenges the sheer amount of time it takes to travel within Canada. In the unlikely event that our goals are not reached, the funds raised will be used to pressure the Federal government on its stance on Airports to tackle the high costs associated with air travel.</p>
<p>Canadian airports are treated as toll booths instead of economic growth engines, a short sighted stance that has resulted in Canadians priced out of domestic travel unlike Europeans, Americans and far east Asia that recognizes the benefits of affordable aviation.</p>
<p>The funds will be invested in social media initiatives that educate Canadians on how tourism, industry and every facet of our economy will benefit from affordable aviation. We aim to spread awareness and use the frustration we create to force Ottawa to change its attitude towards airports.</p>
<p>We believe that a Canada where middle class families can afford to travel within Canada is a stronger Canada.</p>
<p>See our <a href=""https://goo.gl/kdtKI4%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">open letter </a>to PM Justin Trudeau. (PS Congratulations)</p>
<p><i>The business plan does not depend on the government changing its stance, however both initiatives succeeding will do a world of good for millions of Canadians.</i></p>

<b>Select Quotes:</b><br/><br/>“We aren’t the same low-cost airline that we were in 1996. Our costs have gone up quite a bit and that happens when an airline matures… So a brand-new ULCC would have costs that would be below us, and we always said that he with the lowest costs wins. But there’s a question of whether or not you need to be the absolute lowest cost or whether you just need to be lower cost than another main competitor of yours, so we’re in a comfortable spot because we’ve got a domestic competitor that’s got costs that are quite a bit higher than ours. Nevertheless, a new ULCC would probably create some havoc.” <br/><b><br/>- Gregg Saretksy, WestJet CEO </b><b>Oct 2nd 2015 Financial Post</b><br/><br/>""The Zing vision is what Canadians have been waiting for since the earliest days of aviation in Canada.

Threats and Challenges:We forecast a major upset of the current system as major airlines respond with force to crush this idea but ultimately fail to combat the CSeries with their fleet of misfit planes and band aid solutions.

At a minimum this venture will force the industry to adopt a more point-to-point system of travel realizing the vision of Zing Airlines’ founders.  

At its maximum, we envision dethroning WestJet as Canada’s #2 carrier; it is our opinion that their fleet is a mismatch for the skies of Canada given the advent of the CSeries. Their over dependence on the foreign made 737 was their greatest strength and we intend on making it their greatest weakness.  
FAQ




Why social media and crowd funding? 
Social media educates the public on what is possible. It highlights an
issue and solution that many Canadians have faced and had trouble articulating. 
An educated public will be able to support this venture via crowd
funding.
An educated public will never be satisfied with the current set up of air travel now that they know what is possible.
By having this idea go viral, we will get the attention of
politicians, potential investors and other key players necessary to make this
happen.
Successful crowd funding here is a vote for connecting Canadian communities, protecting Canadian jobs and reuniting friends and families.
What will the funds be used for?
Funds raised here will be used to pay for the initial and
non-recurring cost of setting up an airline. The costs are mainly business
development and passing all legal requirements and certification.  
Once this milestone are accomplished, Zing Airlines will be in a
position to raise funds on the capital market for our 2nd and last
round of funding. This final round of funding shall give us the means to start
our airline by the 2nd quarter of 2017.
What if your goal is not reached?
The idea of Zing Airlines challenges the sheer amount of time it takes to travel within Canada. In the unlikely event that our goals are not reached, the funds raised will be used to pressure the Federal government on its stance on Airports to tackle the high costs associated with air travel.
Canadian airports are treated as toll booths instead of economic growth engines, a short sighted stance that has resulted in Canadians priced out of domestic travel unlike Europeans, Americans and far east Asia that recognizes the benefits of affordable aviation.
The funds will be invested in social media initiatives that educate Canadians on how tourism, industry and every facet of our economy will benefit from affordable aviation. We aim to spread awareness and use the frustration we create to force Ottawa to change its attitude towards airports.
We believe that a Canada where middle class families can afford to travel within Canada is a stronger Canada.
See our open letter to PM Justin Trudeau. (PS Congratulations)
The business plan does not depend on the government changing its stance, however both initiatives succeeding will do a world of good for millions of Canadians.

Why is there only one perk?


New perks will be issued during the duration of the campaign.

Select Quotes:“We aren’t the same low-cost airline that we were in 1996. Our costs have gone up quite a bit and that happens when an airline matures… So a brand-new ULCC would have costs that would be below us, and we always said that he with the lowest costs wins. But there’s a question of whether or not you need to be the absolute lowest cost or whether you just need to be lower cost than another main competitor of yours, so we’re in a comfortable spot because we’ve got a domestic competitor that’s got costs that are quite a bit higher than ours. Nevertheless, a new ULCC would probably create some havoc.” - Gregg Saretksy, WestJet CEO Oct 2nd 2015 Financial Post""The Zing vision is what Canadians have been waiting for since the earliest days of aviation in Canada. We finally have the right plane to connect our country the way it ought to be connected. It would be a national tragedy to let this chance slip through our hands. I invite the nation to back this project and be part of the most exciting and daring venture in Canadian aviation."" -Wayne Fernandes, Founder of Zing Airlines""It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things. For the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order.""  - Machiavelli",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>My Story</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <p>I have taken a very crooked path to get to this fellowship, but I believe every step was worth it. After finishing high school I chose not to go to university and worked retail sales and customer service. While in customer service, I realised my job wasn't fulfilling and decided to study something that would enable me to ""help people"" I chose sociology with the intention of joining the non-profit sector when I graduated. After university, while working various jobs I realised that the non-profit model left a lot to be desired. We were at the mercy of funders and projects that need to happen at times wouldn't, simply because of money. My search for a better solution lead me to social enterprise.</p>
<p>At
my last job, I even did up a proposal for a social enterprise to help women in
Bomba (video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8nq4zlFCCQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). That project got me into the Project Inspire 2014 grand
finals where I got a chance to meet some awesome change makers and social
entrepreneurs. My project didn't win, but the experience impacted the way I
did  things when I got home and helped me
improve the project plan. Besides the work I've done, I truly believe that social enterprise is the solution to development in emerging markets and see the IDEX Global Fellowship as an opportunity to learn as much as I can. I aim to bring that knowledge back home and share it with as many people will listen (maybe even a few who won't)</p>

My Story

   I have taken a very crooked path to get to this fellowship, but I believe every step was worth it. After finishing high school I chose not to go to university and worked retail sales and customer service. While in customer service, I realised my job wasn't fulfilling and decided to study something that would enable me to ""help people"" I chose sociology with the intention of joining the non-profit sector when I graduated. After university, while working various jobs I realised that the non-profit model left a lot to be desired. We were at the mercy of funders and projects that need to happen at times wouldn't, simply because of money. My search for a better solution lead me to social enterprise.
At
my last job, I even did up a proposal for a social enterprise to help women in
Bomba (video here). That project got me into the Project Inspire 2014 grand
finals where I got a chance to meet some awesome change makers and social
entrepreneurs. My project didn't win, but the experience impacted the way I
did  things when I got home and helped me
improve the project plan. Besides the work I've done, I truly believe that social enterprise is the solution to development in emerging markets and see the IDEX Global Fellowship as an opportunity to learn as much as I can. I aim to bring that knowledge back home and share it with as many people will listen (maybe even a few who won't)
    How YOU Can Help I am fortunate and have been given a partial scholarship to cover the tuition portion of my fellowship, but still
have additional costs to cover. That's where YOU come in. I need your help to be able to cater for the items I am personally responsible for funding.The fellowship will provide me with a small stipend, but I am still responsible for the cost of my airfare, visa application, medical aid (health insurance) and living expenses.That's where YOU come in. I need your help to be able to cater for the items I am personally responsible for funding.

<h1>Video Sales Work!</h1>
<h3>Your chance to utilize one of the newest marketing trends at a heavily discounted price.<br/>
</h3>
<p>YouTube Video marketing is the new wave of internet marketing. The New York Times recently reported that even major toy makers and toy sellers are making a bigger effort to promote their wares through YouTube videos. <br/></p>
<p>Until now finding a video creation specialist that can make a nice customized video for your business was often an expensive proposition. And then you needed to find a SEO (Search Engine Optimization) specialist to get your video found by your potential customers.<br/></p>
<p>We don't just make you a nice video, customized for your business, we install it for you in your own YouTube channel. Then we optimize both on page and off page search engine optimization so your new video is found by your new potential customers, <b>often on the top of the first page of Google search</b>. Check out our <a href=""http://videosaleswork.com/testimonials/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">testimonial</a> page as we rank videos for small businesses across the country.<br/></p>
<p>You can also share your video on social media and embed it on your website if you have one. If you do not have a website, we can use YouTube annotations to send your customers to your phone by clicking on the video.</p>
<p>At the bottom of this page find your business type and click on the button to see a sample video that we would customize for you. If your business is not there, email or call me and maybe we have a video for your business we have not yet listed.</p>
<p>Check out the screen shots at the bottom of the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hot-new-trend-video-marketing-for-your-business/x/8417921#/gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gallery</a> page. How much more business would you get with a video that ranks at the top of google search?<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The short version:</p> <ul>
<li>My team and I are looking for work and to make 100 happy customers. </li>
<li>(Keeping the staff busy and making a little dough to make sure they get paid is always good.)<br/>
</li>
<li>In exchange you will get a really cool spokesperson video customized for your business that is ranked high in Google search  for your key word search terms. And for a <b>REALLY LOW PRICE! </b><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>Frequently Asked Questions.</h3>
<p><b>Q.</b> Do I need a website to use video marketing?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> No, you do not need a website. We can use a YouTube annotation and send the viewer directly to your phone number.</p>
<p><b>Q. </b>Will high ranking YouTube videos help the ranking of my website?<b>  <br/></b></p>
<p><b><b>A.</b> </b>We have seen that one high ranking YouTube video will improve the ranking of other videos in the channel, the channel itself and often the linked website. </p>
<p><b><b>Q. </b></b>If I order the website, how do I get a website name (URL) and hosting?<b><b><br/></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b>A.</b></b> </b>I contacted my representative at Godaddy.Com and he said the website name (URL) and hosting would cost about $60. Just call them at: 480-505-8877<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Q. </b>I have heard about ""Black Hat"" SEO and I do not want any of that.<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b><b>A.</b> </b>The vast majority of links built, views made, likes clicked and shares shared are made by real human beings. Nothing ""Black Hat"" involved in humans watching, clicking and sharing.<b> </b>That is also the reason we are a little more expensive for our SEO services.<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Q. </b>What if Google changes it's mind and decides to penalize videos optimized the way you do it?<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b><b>A.</b> </b>Probably will not happen, but if it does, just delete the video from your channel and reload it. The URL will change and any linking, etc. will stay with the old URL and your video is considered ""new"".<b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Q. </b>When will I get my videos, website and hat delivered and ranked in Google search? <b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>A. </b>We will start on a ""first come, first served"" basis. We have the 100 business categories of spokesperson videos ready and we will make your YouTube channel and put up your spokesperson video right away. We will also be shipping the first hats within two weeks of the first purchases.</p>
<p>Anyone that orders a second video or a website that is not listed in the 20 business we have listed may have a several week delay as we locate or create a template for your business.</p>
<p><b>Q.</b> What if I want to start with one video and upgrade before the end of the Indiegogo campaign or add additional SEO services?</p>
<p><b>A.</b> I believe that Indiegogo will allow me to add perks as long as they do not conflict with the existing perks. Email me and I will see if I can add that to this campaign.<br/></p>
<p><b>Have more questions? email me at </b><i>doug at pillid dot com</i><b> or call me at 1-224-856-7764</b><br/></p>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3>Why this project and Indiegogo campaign?</h3>
<p>The longer version of the story:
</p>
<p>As an aside to my website development work I have been 
following the phenomenon of video marketing on YouTube for the past 
year. I learned how to produce videos and get them to show up in the top
 of Google search. 
</p>
<p>Being totally fascinated by this new trend, I began to attend every 
webinar and buy every program I could find about producing and ranking 
YouTube videos. For nearly a year I have learned everything I could 
learn and bought nearly all the ""stock"" videos I could find. Hundreds of
 them!

</p>
<p>When I started this project a couple months ago our intention was to 
have about 20 different business types available with at least two stock
 videos for each. In doing my market research I found many potential 
customers that did not fall into the 20 different businesses but most 
were in the 100 businesses we had spokesperson videos for.  
</p>
<p>Consequently our project has suffered from ""mission creep"" and we 
have expanded to 100+ business types with at least two videos and a 
website template for each. This delayed our launch date by about 45 - 60
 days.</p>
<p>We do have over 100 ""spokesperson"" type videos ready to go and could 
have one of these videos ranking in Google video or YouTube search for 
you in a matter of days after you order it.</p>
<br/><h3>Risks, Challenges &amp; Solutions<br/>
</h3> <ul>
<li>In my opinion as an ""old guy"" who has been around the block a few times, this is a fairly low risk undertaking and has every potential to satisfy every customer.</li>
<li>I have been a recruiter and manager all my life, often hiring, training and managing dozens or even hundreds of employees for ""project work"". I am confident I can scale this campaign to whatever the sales are.<br/>
</li>
<li>Our greatest challenge could be meeting deadlines if we cannot sell our receivable from Indiegogo/Paypal. (We do have someone tentatively lined up to help with this)<br/>
</li>
<li>All and all, I have high expectations for both our crowdfunding campaign and the website.</li>
</ul> <p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If this offer is not for you or you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help:</p> <ul>
<li>If you know someone with a small business that needs more clients, let them know this could be one of the best advertising offers they might find this year.</li>
<li>Like us and Share us on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc.<br/>
</li>
<li>Also remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>And you could always just buy the <i>Gold Angel Investor</i> hat!<br/>
</li>

</div></div>","Video Sales Work!
Your chance to utilize one of the newest marketing trends at a heavily discounted price.

YouTube Video marketing is the new wave of internet marketing. The New York Times recently reported that even major toy makers and toy sellers are making a bigger effort to promote their wares through YouTube videos. 
Until now finding a video creation specialist that can make a nice customized video for your business was often an expensive proposition. And then you needed to find a SEO (Search Engine Optimization) specialist to get your video found by your potential customers.
We don't just make you a nice video, customized for your business, we install it for you in your own YouTube channel. Then we optimize both on page and off page search engine optimization so your new video is found by your new potential customers, often on the top of the first page of Google search. Check out our testimonial page as we rank videos for small businesses across the country.
You can also share your video on social media and embed it on your website if you have one. If you do not have a website, we can use YouTube annotations to send your customers to your phone by clicking on the video.
At the bottom of this page find your business type and click on the button to see a sample video that we would customize for you. If your business is not there, email or call me and maybe we have a video for your business we have not yet listed.
Check out the screen shots at the bottom of the gallery page. How much more business would you get with a video that ranks at the top of google search?


What We Need & What You Get The short version: 
My team and I are looking for work and to make 100 happy customers. 
(Keeping the staff busy and making a little dough to make sure they get paid is always good.)

In exchange you will get a really cool spokesperson video customized for your business that is ranked high in Google search  for your key word search terms. And for a REALLY LOW PRICE! 


Frequently Asked Questions.
Q. Do I need a website to use video marketing?
A. No, you do not need a website. We can use a YouTube annotation and send the viewer directly to your phone number.
Q. Will high ranking YouTube videos help the ranking of my website?  
A. We have seen that one high ranking YouTube video will improve the ranking of other videos in the channel, the channel itself and often the linked website. 
Q. If I order the website, how do I get a website name (URL) and hosting?
A. I contacted my representative at Godaddy.Com and he said the website name (URL) and hosting would cost about $60. Just call them at: 480-505-8877
Q. I have heard about ""Black Hat"" SEO and I do not want any of that.
A. The vast majority of links built, views made, likes clicked and shares shared are made by real human beings. Nothing ""Black Hat"" involved in humans watching, clicking and sharing. That is also the reason we are a little more expensive for our SEO services.
Q. What if Google changes it's mind and decides to penalize videos optimized the way you do it?
A. Probably will not happen, but if it does, just delete the video from your channel and reload it. The URL will change and any linking, etc. will stay with the old URL and your video is considered ""new"".
Q. When will I get my videos, website and hat delivered and ranked in Google search? 
A. We will start on a ""first come, first served"" basis. We have the 100 business categories of spokesperson videos ready and we will make your YouTube channel and put up your spokesperson video right away. We will also be shipping the first hats within two weeks of the first purchases.
Anyone that orders a second video or a website that is not listed in the 20 business we have listed may have a several week delay as we locate or create a template for your business.
Q. What if I want to start with one video and upgrade before the end of the Indiegogo campaign or add additional SEO services?
A. I believe that Indiegogo will allow me to add perks as long as they do not conflict with the existing perks. Email me and I will see if I can add that to this campaign.
Have more questions? email me at doug at pillid dot com or call me at 1-224-856-7764


Why this project and Indiegogo campaign?
The longer version of the story:

As an aside to my website development work I have been 
following the phenomenon of video marketing on YouTube for the past 
year. I learned how to produce videos and get them to show up in the top
 of Google search. 

Being totally fascinated by this new trend, I began to attend every 
webinar and buy every program I could find about producing and ranking 
YouTube videos. For nearly a year I have learned everything I could 
learn and bought nearly all the ""stock"" videos I could find. Hundreds of
 them!


When I started this project a couple months ago our intention was to 
have about 20 different business types available with at least two stock
 videos for each. In doing my market research I found many potential 
customers that did not fall into the 20 different businesses but most 
were in the 100 businesses we had spokesperson videos for.  

Consequently our project has suffered from ""mission creep"" and we 
have expanded to 100+ business types with at least two videos and a 
website template for each. This delayed our launch date by about 45 - 60
 days.
We do have over 100 ""spokesperson"" type videos ready to go and could 
have one of these videos ranking in Google video or YouTube search for 
you in a matter of days after you order it.
Risks, Challenges & Solutions
 
In my opinion as an ""old guy"" who has been around the block a few times, this is a fairly low risk undertaking and has every potential to satisfy every customer.
I have been a recruiter and manager all my life, often hiring, training and managing dozens or even hundreds of employees for ""project work"". I am confident I can scale this campaign to whatever the sales are.

Our greatest challenge could be meeting deadlines if we cannot sell our receivable from Indiegogo/Paypal. (We do have someone tentatively lined up to help with this)

All and all, I have high expectations for both our crowdfunding campaign and the website.
   
Other Ways You Can Help If this offer is not for you or you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help: 
If you know someone with a small business that needs more clients, let them know this could be one of the best advertising offers they might find this year.
Like us and Share us on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc.

Also remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!
And you could always just buy the Gold Angel Investor hat!

  And that is about all. Visit us and watch our progress at the new website Video Sales Work.

My name is April Trueblood. I’m an artist, musician, and gallery owner living on Hatteras Island, just off the coast of North Carolina. I own a little shop called The Swell Art Gallery. </p><p>In 2014, I purchased a gallery called Indian Town Gallery from my then boss who wished to move away. By the end of 2017, I had to accept that this business could barely afford its own rent, but absolutely would never be able to pay me a salary. Some of our vendors often (and very kindly) waited longer than normal for us to get their invoices paid as well. So, it became apparent that we needed to close up shop or find a more affordable spot.</p><p>Fortune smiled upon us and the perfect place fell into our laps. A space with a lease that will cost half as much as our original location and in a bustling part of Buxton - home of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse - became available. We committed to rent it immediately. However, after years of sitting empty, it would need some work. The new owner of that space, a commercial contractor from Pennsylvania, agreed to do the work to get us in there.</p><p>Below is the old Falcon Motel - the place we've had our hearts set on. These are a couple of photos of it in two of its earlier incarnations. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620685957/cxyoaayxxkhiikhcy8sb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>I love this place. It’s one of those retro roadside motel kind of buildings. Built in 1962 by the Jennette family, it’s a landmark cherished by many local residents as well as the thousands of guests who have stayed there over the years.</p><p>The Falcon fell into disrepair, was partially gutted, and had been foreclosed upon. Once the foreclosing bank put the property on the market, one offer came from a development company who planned to tear it down and build condos. For that reason, the bank chose instead to sell it to the current owners who proposed restoring/renovating it, citing that it would be better for the community to preserve it. The front block of motel rooms closest to Highway 12 is the building that had been gutted. The owner decided it would make a nice retail space, so that’s the part of the motel we've worked hard to occupy.</p><p>Along with the family who now owns it, I'm thrilled about the prospect of breathing new life into this wonderful property. The location is so great. It’s right in the busiest part of Buxton, just north of the Cape Hatteras lighthouse. Our original location was farther south and on a path less traveled. Between the busier location and the cutting in half of the rent, it seems apparent that if a quirky little art shop can survive anywhere on this island, this must be the place.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620687353/w1haj34m7v7r3uqvzor0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong><i>Above: Negan from The Walking Dead (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) stops by to shop from time to time. He's just a regular person. Who would've guessed?</i></strong></p><p>In early 2018, we moved out of our original home and waited for the renovations to commence. However, between missteps and issues with the county government and COVID-19, the owner wasn’t able to get the work done. We waited. And waited. And waited. During that time, we rebranded. We were no longer in the Indiantown Shores area of Frisco, so the old name had to go. We became The Swell Art Gallery.</p><p>By mid-2020, it was obvious that if we were ever to move into the Falcon, I’d have to hire a contractor. </p><p>With the offer of a loan from a family friend in my pocket, Ty Vayette and Tom Hardee of SeaQuest Construction looked at the project with a sympathetic eye. Having known me for many years, Mr. Vayette decided to trust that if SeaQuest did the work, I would figure out how to pay them. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627275538/jwtkgkemic6qcpbhmfhl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620686250/ddkm65oc8wgdxzkg8iyo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627272071/rr3dpoas7ato5cd50qug.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Three years later, the work is complete and the loan never materialized. In addition to the usual way that construction projects go over budget, the pandemic-related significant rise in costs of materials in 2020 caused the price tag of the project to soar. I’ve been making little payments along the way from a small EIDL loan I'd taken out in early 2020, plus small loans from my family. But I’m very far behind and it’s well past time for me to pay off the contractor. This is where I could really use some help.</p><p>If you came to one of our craft shows, painted a TINY canvas or used our scholarship for school, enjoyed a gallery event, found the perfect gift at the shop, saw something that made you laugh or think or consider taking up art yourself, would you consider helping us out with this if you can?</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620686535/zspcyawfoqfy0mnf2yjp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We’ve been working on a cool perks package that has offerings from some of our artists and other local businesses as well.

We love being part of the Outer Banks' rich and dedicated creative community, a local home for Hatteras Island’s artistic talent, and a place where visitors and local residents alike can can be inspired by the fine art, clever design, and sweet gifts that we have to offer. Your support will help us to finally get our footing in a location where we can thrive, and keep us around longer to establish more scholarships (so far we’ve got one!), re-instate our feral kitten adoption program (yes - we used to find homes for feral kittens until we gave a permanent home to two rescues) and continue our involvement in community arts programs that bring people together.</p><p>In this gallery, I’ve finally found something to do with my life that has given me fulfillment. I’ve seriously never had that before. Building this joyful, creative, innovative yet nostalgic space is the most satisfying thing I've ever done. For almost 7 years now, I’ve been wholly engaged with this project and taken every opportunity to learn how to be a better artist, business person, and community member. And I'm just getting started.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620686602/hbhqrkznzb5u9iwfsb5s.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We are grateful for anything we get.

I’m an artist, musician, and gallery owner living on Hatteras Island, just off the coast of North Carolina. I own a little shop called The Swell Art Gallery. In 2014, I purchased a gallery called Indian Town Gallery from my then boss who wished to move away. By the end of 2017, I had to accept that this business could barely afford its own rent, but absolutely would never be able to pay me a salary. Some of our vendors often (and very kindly) waited longer than normal for us to get their invoices paid as well. So, it became apparent that we needed to close up shop or find a more affordable spot.Fortune smiled upon us and the perfect place fell into our laps. A space with a lease that will cost half as much as our original location and in a bustling part of Buxton - home of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse - became available. We committed to rent it immediately. However, after years of sitting empty, it would need some work. The new owner of that space, a commercial contractor from Pennsylvania, agreed to do the work to get us in there.Below is the old Falcon Motel - the place we've had our hearts set on. These are a couple of photos of it in two of its earlier incarnations. I love this place. It’s one of those retro roadside motel kind of buildings. Built in 1962 by the Jennette family, it’s a landmark cherished by many local residents as well as the thousands of guests who have stayed there over the years.The Falcon fell into disrepair, was partially gutted, and had been foreclosed upon. Once the foreclosing bank put the property on the market, one offer came from a development company who planned to tear it down and build condos. For that reason, the bank chose instead to sell it to the current owners who proposed restoring/renovating it, citing that it would be better for the community to preserve it. The front block of motel rooms closest to Highway 12 is the building that had been gutted. The owner decided it would make a nice retail space, so that’s the part of the motel we've worked hard to occupy.Along with the family who now owns it, I'm thrilled about the prospect of breathing new life into this wonderful property. The location is so great. It’s right in the busiest part of Buxton, just north of the Cape Hatteras lighthouse. Our original location was farther south and on a path less traveled. Between the busier location and the cutting in half of the rent, it seems apparent that if a quirky little art shop can survive anywhere on this island, this must be the place.Above: Negan from The Walking Dead (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) stops by to shop from time to time. He's just a regular person. Who would've guessed?In early 2018, we moved out of our original home and waited for the renovations to commence. However, between missteps and issues with the county government and COVID-19, the owner wasn’t able to get the work done. We waited. And waited. And waited. During that time, we rebranded. We were no longer in the Indiantown Shores area of Frisco, so the old name had to go. We became The Swell Art Gallery.By mid-2020, it was obvious that if we were ever to move into the Falcon, I’d have to hire a contractor. With the offer of a loan from a family friend in my pocket, Ty Vayette and Tom Hardee of SeaQuest Construction looked at the project with a sympathetic eye. Having known me for many years, Mr. Vayette decided to trust that if SeaQuest did the work, I would figure out how to pay them. Three years later, the work is complete and the loan never materialized. In addition to the usual way that construction projects go over budget, the pandemic-related significant rise in costs of materials in 2020 caused the price tag of the project to soar. I’ve been making little payments along the way from a small EIDL loan I'd taken out in early 2020, plus small loans from my family. But I’m very far behind and it’s well past time for me to pay off the contractor. This is where I could really use some help.If you came to one of our craft shows, painted a TINY canvas or used our scholarship for school, enjoyed a gallery event, found the perfect gift at the shop, saw something that made you laugh or think or consider taking up art yourself, would you consider helping us out with this if you can?We’ve been working on a cool perks package that has offerings from some of our artists and other local businesses as well. Take a look! There are lots of fun perks up for grabs!We support a number of local artists, potters, jewelry makers, and photographers in our gallery and seek out handmade arts and crafts from American artists as much as possible. We love being part of the Outer Banks' rich and dedicated creative community, a local home for Hatteras Island’s artistic talent, and a place where visitors and local residents alike can can be inspired by the fine art, clever design, and sweet gifts that we have to offer. Your support will help us to finally get our footing in a location where we can thrive, and keep us around longer to establish more scholarships (so far we’ve got one!), re-instate our feral kitten adoption program (yes - we used to find homes for feral kittens until we gave a permanent home to two rescues) and continue our involvement in community arts programs that bring people together.In this gallery, I’ve finally found something to do with my life that has given me fulfillment. I’ve seriously never had that before. Building this joyful, creative, innovative yet nostalgic space is the most satisfying thing I've ever done. For almost 7 years now, I’ve been wholly engaged with this project and taken every opportunity to learn how to be a better artist, business person, and community member. And I'm just getting started.We are grateful for anything we get. And we don't expect that everyone who would like to chip in to this campaign has the funds to do so. Please don't stress about that! You can help us out by sharing this on your social media or by telling any of your friends who may be interested in this project about it. You can also stop by and see the new place when you're next in town. And if you're fans of Sam and Honeybun, our shop cats, please come by and give them some love.

<h3>La campagne</h3>
<p>C'est important pour nous d'inclure le plus de monde possible dans cette aventure parce qu'on la construit aussi pour vous. Vos contributions vont avoir un impact direct sur notre projet et l'amour qu'on partage tous pour la moto et sa communauté. C'est avec beaucoup d'émotions qu'on imagine déjà vous voir débarquer au <strong>Idle </strong>et profiter des stations, des outils spécialisés, de notre équipe mécanique, de notre café et d'un accueil chaleureux de notre staff. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Notre objectif</h3>
<p>On vise 25,000$. Avec votre aide, on va pouvoir améliorer notre site web pour faciliter les réservations et offrir aux membres des formations mécaniques, mieux équiper le coin DIY et upgrader nos outils spécialisés qui seront offerts en libre-service. </p>
<h3>Le concept DIY </h3>
<p>Nos stations DIY sont spécialement conçues pour vos projets moto et sont disponibles en location à un tarif horaire abordable et peuvent être réservées à l'avance. Une station comprend un ensemble complet d'outils métriques et impériaux, un lift à moto et suffisamment d'espace pour travailler. Nous inclurons même tout le nécessaire, tels que des gants en caoutchouc, des linges de travail, du dégraissant et des produits de nettoyage. Il y aura sur place des outils spécialisés pour changer et balancer vos pneus etc. On proposera aussi des formations mécaniques 101 afin que vous puissiez améliorer vos compétences dans un environnement relax. Les membres auront accès à un tarif réduit sur les location DIY, les formations mensuelles et un tas d’autres avantages.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>La situation actuelle rend difficile le financement d'un tel projet, mais ça ne nous arrête pas pour autant. On travaille jour et nuit pour rénover le grand local en plein coeur de Villeray sur la rue Jean-Talon, avec notre terrasse, notre parking à moto, et nos deux portes de garages qui donnent sur la rue. Un de nos challenges fut de trouver une compagnie d'assurance pour ce projet ambitieux, et nous avons eu la chance de tomber sur un courtier qui nous a trouvé le partenaire idéal pour le garage, le café et les espaces DIY. On est conscient que nous allons rencontrer plusieurs défis, nous croyons en notre rêve et à voir l'amour qu'on reçoit depuis le début, vous aussi. Avec nos backgrounds et expériences, on forme une équipe soudée et compétentes qui se relève les manches depuis de nombreux mois, pis on fait juste commencer. On est aussi accompagné par une experte en droit des affaires, <a href=""https://www.vigiquebec.com/equipes/me-sylvie-bougie/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sylvie Bougie</a> et une solide équipe de comptables. </p>
<p>On est tout prêt de l'autoroute 40, de la rue Saint-Hubert et du Marché Jean-Talon, accessible à tous. On ouvre le <strong>1er Mai</strong> pis on vous veut dans l'aventure!</p>

David Lechasseur, copropriétaire du Savvy Barbershop, directeur du marketing et partenariat. Il vient aussi retrouver le même rôle qu’il occupe déjà au Savvy. En résumé, deux gars qui savent comment faire rouler (oh le jeu de mots) une entreprise avec succès. 
Charle-Élie Dumontier: propriétaire accompli du garage Sheriff à Bolton Est, il rejoint le projet comme directeur mécanique et amène sa grande expertise en maintenance, réparation et modification customs. Un de ses premier build fut figuré sur un des sites motos les plus consultés en Amérique du Nord. Il offrira aussi des formations mensuelles et des accompagnements privés pour démocratiser la mécanique moto.
Raphaël Gaspard: entrepreneur en série et membre de la cohorte 2015 de l’émission Dans l’Oeil du Dragon ou il a reçu les éloges unanimes des juges, il apporte son expertise en technologie et en restauration. Il occupe le rôle de gestionnaire aux opérations et sera aussi responsable du comptoir café et des stations DIY. 

La campagne
C'est important pour nous d'inclure le plus de monde possible dans cette aventure parce qu'on la construit aussi pour vous. Vos contributions vont avoir un impact direct sur notre projet et l'amour qu'on partage tous pour la moto et sa communauté. C'est avec beaucoup d'émotions qu'on imagine déjà vous voir débarquer au Idle et profiter des stations, des outils spécialisés, de notre équipe mécanique, de notre café et d'un accueil chaleureux de notre staff. 

Notre objectif
On vise 25,000$. Avec votre aide, on va pouvoir améliorer notre site web pour faciliter les réservations et offrir aux membres des formations mécaniques, mieux équiper le coin DIY et upgrader nos outils spécialisés qui seront offerts en libre-service. 
Le concept DIY 
Nos stations DIY sont spécialement conçues pour vos projets moto et sont disponibles en location à un tarif horaire abordable et peuvent être réservées à l'avance. Une station comprend un ensemble complet d'outils métriques et impériaux, un lift à moto et suffisamment d'espace pour travailler. Nous inclurons même tout le nécessaire, tels que des gants en caoutchouc, des linges de travail, du dégraissant et des produits de nettoyage. Il y aura sur place des outils spécialisés pour changer et balancer vos pneus etc. On proposera aussi des formations mécaniques 101 afin que vous puissiez améliorer vos compétences dans un environnement relax. Les membres auront accès à un tarif réduit sur les location DIY, les formations mensuelles et un tas d’autres avantages.

Challenges
La situation actuelle rend difficile le financement d'un tel projet, mais ça ne nous arrête pas pour autant. On travaille jour et nuit pour rénover le grand local en plein coeur de Villeray sur la rue Jean-Talon, avec notre terrasse, notre parking à moto, et nos deux portes de garages qui donnent sur la rue. Un de nos challenges fut de trouver une compagnie d'assurance pour ce projet ambitieux, et nous avons eu la chance de tomber sur un courtier qui nous a trouvé le partenaire idéal pour le garage, le café et les espaces DIY. On est conscient que nous allons rencontrer plusieurs défis, nous croyons en notre rêve et à voir l'amour qu'on reçoit depuis le début, vous aussi. Avec nos backgrounds et expériences, on forme une équipe soudée et compétentes qui se relève les manches depuis de nombreux mois, pis on fait juste commencer. On est aussi accompagné par une experte en droit des affaires, Sylvie Bougie et une solide équipe de comptables. 
On est tout prêt de l'autoroute 40, de la rue Saint-Hubert et du Marché Jean-Talon, accessible à tous. On ouvre le 1er Mai pis on vous veut dans l'aventure!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>Our Story:</h1>
<p>The concept of contemporary outdoor furniture was designed by myself, Ed Gollob, a 30-year veteran of the plastics industry. Easy Living LLC is a division of GO Plastics LLC, a manufacturer of rotationally molded polyethylene products since 1986. We built all our furniture sets using the same concept as our outdoor polyethylene free publication racks, advertising benches and waste containers, seen throughout every state in the United States. This process makes Easy Living outdoor furniture stronger and more durable than any other competitors.</p>
<p>After conducting a thorough research of outdoor furniture, we became obsessed with creating the very best in long-lasting outdoor polyethylene furniture in the industry and perhaps worldwide! Why should consumers only have to select from dull, expensive, bulky, hard to assemble outdoor furniture?  Working together with my son, Neal Gollob, who is the General Manager and Head of Product Design, we created the finest outdoor furniture that will allow mix and match options. <br/></p>

<div><b>EDUCATION</b></div>
<div>We are currently giving to our partners, MCDF in Zimbabwe, Africa to provide education to children there. Our goal is to sponsor at least 17 children by the end the year, if we could, it would be great to sponsor as many as 51 children this year! The children that we sponsor attend school for three terms each year. For every $40 you give to our Spondor a <span>Child fund, we can sponsor a child's education for one of their three terms. For every $120 you give, we can sponsor one child for their entire school year. </span>
</div>
<div><b>FOOD &amp; WATER  - GIVE 51 CENTS CREW</b></div>
<div>Since, our partners MCDF in Zimbabwe, Africa are also experiencing food shortages due to the El Nino effect, we are specifically raising funds to get food to their children. For every 51 people that give $.51 cents to our GIVE 51 CENTS CREW food fund, we will be able to feed 100 children! Our goal is to feed at least 5100 children by the end of the year.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Also, we are giving to provide water to a village in Uganda, Africa through our partners Action in Africa. For every 51 people that give $.51 cents to our GIVE 51 CENTS CREW water fund, we will be able to provide over 100 gallons of water a month to their village!</span></div>
<div><b>SHELTER &amp; CLOTHING</b></div>
<div>We have several other partners that help out in these areas, such as A Child's Place &amp; CF Housing, so if you are passionate about providing to these areas, give to our Shelter &amp; Clothing funds respectively.</div>

<h3><b>OUR STORY </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our story's inspirational beginning can be traced back to over a decade ago. It started with overseas orphans, it began with a 10 year old homeless child in the U.S., &amp; it continues through a nautically inspired, generous, adventurous, bold brand culture. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448779464/ovlh0jbnnfrpuwpjvvsh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In December of 2011, Alexander Greer started mentoring at a Charlotte based mentoring program. Several weeks later, he discovered that the 10 year old child he was mentoring was homeless and that he was helping take care of his other younger homeless siblings. This realization grabbed Alex’s heart with compassion and inspired him to start a movement to help impoverished children in Charlotte and beyond. So, Alex joined with his friend, Jonathan Jones to form GIVE FIFTY ONE (GFO) to help children in need. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448780246/a9qw1grunctzertlvygw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b>Alexander with some of the children he mentored.</b><br/><p>Soon after discovering the homeless child, they began to research child homelessness and learned that at that time, over 1.6 million children in the United States and tens of millions of children worldwide were without homes. Jonathan and Alex soon became aware that in their own community of Charlotte alone the number of homeless children had risen from 1,038 in 2004 to 4,711 in 2011. </p>
<p>Additionally, Alex’s mission trip to Africa in the Summer of 2011, and Jonathan’s mission trip to the Dominican Republic in the Spring of 1999 exposed them both to impoverished children which planted within them a passion to one day help children in need. So after their direct encounter with child homelessness through the Charlotte mentoring program, they took action by purchasing 12 t-shirts to sell to friends so that they could use the profit to help children. After selling t-shirts, they started selling watches to bring more awareness to helping children. As of 2015, Alex and Jonathan transformed GIVE FIFTY ONE into a nonprofit brand. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448280445/jouyv6tzqg2v0y0go5gh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                 <b>Alexander in Zimbabwe in 2011 <b><b>(standing center).</b></b></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448280154/uwckbaggdtxeeukbazuc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                           <b>Jonathan in the Dominican Republic in 1999 (far right).</b><p>Now, we continue to help children locally, through partnering with organizations that help children in need &amp; helps children internationally, through child sponsorships.

<h3>THE IMPACT: PROBLEM, SOLUTION &amp; BEYOND</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449203563/pfuybjot5akbhjdgfz49.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>       <b>Thank you to each volunteer &amp; supporter for helping create this impact!</b></p>
<p>As our Co-Founder Alex stated, there is a <b>problem </b>when there are tens of millions of children in need throughout the world. To counter that problem, we see a <b>solution</b>, through offering watches that provide funds to meet these needs. So, this campaign &amp; your contribution both have value extending beyond this generation. </p>
<p>The value of your contribution lies not only within the GFO watch you will receive as a perk in return, but also within the life change of children that is generated from your giving. <b>When considering which level you will back us on, remember Normally, pictured below</b>. According to her village's reports, many sponsored children like her, have either graduated and are pursuing higher education or they have careers. So likewise, Normally's life can be made greater through your contribution!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458285360/pxiofjg6cycmruqra5kl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>WHY THIS CAMPAIGN </h3>
<div>
<b>First Campaign Launch Reason</b>We are launching this campaign for several reasons. As stated above, we are raising funds to meet our 2016 goals. We are also using this campaign to help share our New Coast is Clear Watch with our friends, families, &amp; beyond!<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448786775/nmmscxv0ocdqikollqep.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The <b>Coast is Clear</b> is a classic timepiece that is both stylish and comfortable to wear. In creating it, we kept it clean, with no hour marks, so that the message is <i>clear</i>: <b>It's not about time, it's about a story. </b>The story of how when you get a watch, we will give a watch &amp; 51 keys of greatness to a child in need!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449013799/g2tf9jx2dk7onzomdu5b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Also, when you purchase and wear a <b>Coast is Clear</b> watch, you are able to be a voice for children in need &amp; share with your friends and family how you are contributing to our GIVE FIFTY ONE story, so that they are able to help also.</p>
<p>The <b>Coast is Clear</b> is great for almost any occasion. Whether you are sailing, at work or hanging out with friends, it will fit right in. And remember, when you wear a Coast is Clear, you are not just wearing another ordinary watch, you are wearing a watch with purpose.</p>

<p><b>Other Campaign Reasons</b></p>
<p>Additionally, we are launching this campaign so that we can meet our other goals for this upcoming year, such as doubling our child sponsorships, covering administration &amp; improving customer experience, among other things.</p>
<div>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET </h3>
<p>With this campaign, we are seeking to raise $4,435 for this 2nd quarter. We are seeking to raise this amount so that we can feed 5100 children, provide over 1200 gallons of water to a village, sponsor at least 17 children's education, &amp; give to provide shelter &amp; clothing to children in need.</p>
<p>Additionally, this amount will help us accomplish each of our goals in an excellent, efficient &amp; effective manner &amp; hopefully raise more funds beyond our goal to help us grow as a organization!</p>
<p>Aside from this amount we are raising, we plan to be able to use our post-campaign watch sales from the rest of the 2016 year &amp; beyond to be able more direct giving to help children in need.</p>
<p>In return for your contribution, you  get a perk, one or more of our watches. Also, when you contribute, you are both becoming part of Our 2015 Launch Team &amp; additionally, helping us reach our goal! </p>
<h3>OUR PLAN</h3>
<div>1. Launch Go To Give 2nd Quarter Campaign on March 19th, 2016.<p></p>
<p>2. End Campaign within 60 days of start, by May 16, 2016.</p>
<p>3. Send your perks to you within 60 days after Campaign, by July 15, 2016.</p>
<p>4. Sponsor 17 or more children in need by year end 2016.</p>
<p>5. Feed at least 5100 children by year end 2016.</p>
<p>6. Provide over 1200 gallons of water by year end 2016.</p>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>The risk that we foresee are as follows: </p>
<p>The timeline risk of fulfilling your perks after our campaign  completion is a 2 month duration. As stated above,we are estimating that your watches will be shipped out within 2 months after completion of our campaign, which ends on May 16, 2016. So, your watch(es) should be sent out by July 15, 2016. Sometimes manufacturing &amp; shipping delays can occur, if they do, we can keep you posted on any delays, if necessary.</p>
<p>We do not believe the timeline risk is an obstacle we can't overcome. Our team is dedicated to getting your perks to you in a timely fashion. </p>
<p>We have set our campaign to flexible funding so that the risk of not reaching our goal is outweighed by the benefit of keeping all the money we do raise. We plan to use the money raised according to our budget &amp; priorities. If we do not raise the entire amount, we will adjust our budget, so that we meet our priorities first<b>.</b></p>

We are currently giving to our partners, MCDF in Zimbabwe, Africa to provide education to children there. Our goal is to sponsor at least 17 children by the end the year, if we could, it would be great to sponsor as many as 51 children this year! The children that we sponsor attend school for three terms each year. For every $40 you give to our Spondor a Child fund, we can sponsor a child's education for one of their three terms. For every $120 you give, we can sponsor one child for their entire school year. 

FOOD & WATER  - GIVE 51 CENTS CREW
Since, our partners MCDF in Zimbabwe, Africa are also experiencing food shortages due to the El Nino effect, we are specifically raising funds to get food to their children. For every 51 people that give $.51 cents to our GIVE 51 CENTS CREW food fund, we will be able to feed 100 children! Our goal is to feed at least 5100 children by the end of the year.
Also, we are giving to provide water to a village in Uganda, Africa through our partners Action in Africa. For every 51 people that give $.51 cents to our GIVE 51 CENTS CREW water fund, we will be able to provide over 100 gallons of water a month to their village!
SHELTER & CLOTHING
We have several other partners that help out in these areas, such as A Child's Place & CF Housing, so if you are passionate about providing to these areas, give to our Shelter & Clothing funds respectively.

OUR CAMPAIGN: THROUGHOUT THE YEARThis is specific campaign is our 2nd Quarter Get to Give Campaign. Our Get to Give Campaign is continuing through out this year, & is set up in quarterly goals that will help us raise funds each quarter to meet our overall 2016 goals to help children in need. Thank you for your continued support as we proceed throughout this year!

OUR STORY 

Our story's inspirational beginning can be traced back to over a decade ago. It started with overseas orphans, it began with a 10 year old homeless child in the U.S., & it continues through a nautically inspired, generous, adventurous, bold brand culture. 

In December of 2011, Alexander Greer started mentoring at a Charlotte based mentoring program. Several weeks later, he discovered that the 10 year old child he was mentoring was homeless and that he was helping take care of his other younger homeless siblings. This realization grabbed Alex’s heart with compassion and inspired him to start a movement to help impoverished children in Charlotte and beyond. So, Alex joined with his friend, Jonathan Jones to form GIVE FIFTY ONE (GFO) to help children in need. 

Alexander with some of the children he mentored.Soon after discovering the homeless child, they began to research child homelessness and learned that at that time, over 1.6 million children in the United States and tens of millions of children worldwide were without homes. Jonathan and Alex soon became aware that in their own community of Charlotte alone the number of homeless children had risen from 1,038 in 2004 to 4,711 in 2011. 
Additionally, Alex’s mission trip to Africa in the Summer of 2011, and Jonathan’s mission trip to the Dominican Republic in the Spring of 1999 exposed them both to impoverished children which planted within them a passion to one day help children in need. So after their direct encounter with child homelessness through the Charlotte mentoring program, they took action by purchasing 12 t-shirts to sell to friends so that they could use the profit to help children. After selling t-shirts, they started selling watches to bring more awareness to helping children. As of 2015, Alex and Jonathan transformed GIVE FIFTY ONE into a nonprofit brand. 
                                 Alexander in Zimbabwe in 2011 (standing center).                           Jonathan in the Dominican Republic in 1999 (far right).Now, we continue to help children locally, through partnering with organizations that help children in need & helps children internationally, through child sponsorships. We currently sponsor 7 children in Zimbabwe & 1 child in the Dominican Republic.
     
THE IMPACT: PROBLEM, SOLUTION & BEYOND
       Thank you to each volunteer & supporter for helping create this impact!
As our Co-Founder Alex stated, there is a problem when there are tens of millions of children in need throughout the world. To counter that problem, we see a solution, through offering watches that provide funds to meet these needs. So, this campaign & your contribution both have value extending beyond this generation. 
The value of your contribution lies not only within the GFO watch you will receive as a perk in return, but also within the life change of children that is generated from your giving. When considering which level you will back us on, remember Normally, pictured below. According to her village's reports, many sponsored children like her, have either graduated and are pursuing higher education or they have careers. So likewise, Normally's life can be made greater through your contribution!




WHY THIS CAMPAIGN 

First Campaign Launch ReasonWe are launching this campaign for several reasons. As stated above, we are raising funds to meet our 2016 goals. We are also using this campaign to help share our New Coast is Clear Watch with our friends, families, & beyond!

The Coast is Clear is a classic timepiece that is both stylish and comfortable to wear. In creating it, we kept it clean, with no hour marks, so that the message is clear: It's not about time, it's about a story. The story of how when you get a watch, we will give a watch & 51 keys of greatness to a child in need!

Also, when you purchase and wear a Coast is Clear watch, you are able to be a voice for children in need & share with your friends and family how you are contributing to our GIVE FIFTY ONE story, so that they are able to help also.
The Coast is Clear is great for almost any occasion. Whether you are sailing, at work or hanging out with friends, it will fit right in. And remember, when you wear a Coast is Clear, you are not just wearing another ordinary watch, you are wearing a watch with purpose.

Other Campaign Reasons
Additionally, we are launching this campaign so that we can meet our other goals for this upcoming year, such as doubling our child sponsorships, covering administration & improving customer experience, among other things.

WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET 
With this campaign, we are seeking to raise $4,435 for this 2nd quarter. We are seeking to raise this amount so that we can feed 5100 children, provide over 1200 gallons of water to a village, sponsor at least 17 children's education, & give to provide shelter & clothing to children in need.
Additionally, this amount will help us accomplish each of our goals in an excellent, efficient & effective manner & hopefully raise more funds beyond our goal to help us grow as a organization!
Aside from this amount we are raising, we plan to be able to use our post-campaign watch sales from the rest of the 2016 year & beyond to be able more direct giving to help children in need.
In return for your contribution, you  get a perk, one or more of our watches. Also, when you contribute, you are both becoming part of Our 2015 Launch Team & additionally, helping us reach our goal! 
OUR PLAN
1. Launch Go To Give 2nd Quarter Campaign on March 19th, 2016.
2. End Campaign within 60 days of start, by May 16, 2016.
3. Send your perks to you within 60 days after Campaign, by July 15, 2016.
4. Sponsor 17 or more children in need by year end 2016.
5. Feed at least 5100 children by year end 2016.
6. Provide over 1200 gallons of water by year end 2016.
RISKS & CHALLENGES
The risk that we foresee are as follows: 
The timeline risk of fulfilling your perks after our campaign  completion is a 2 month duration. As stated above,we are estimating that your watches will be shipped out within 2 months after completion of our campaign, which ends on May 16, 2016. So, your watch(es) should be sent out by July 15, 2016. Sometimes manufacturing & shipping delays can occur, if they do, we can keep you posted on any delays, if necessary.
We do not believe the timeline risk is an obstacle we can't overcome. Our team is dedicated to getting your perks to you in a timely fashion. 
We have set our campaign to flexible funding so that the risk of not reaching our goal is outweighed by the benefit of keeping all the money we do raise. We plan to use the money raised according to our budget & priorities. If we do not raise the entire amount, we will adjust our budget, so that we meet our priorities first.

My name is David Lanzendörfer and I'm Swiss.
<br/>
I studied electrical engineering for 6 years in ETHZ (3 years) and ZHAW (another 3 years) and then I decided to move to China in order to build cool gadgets.
<br/>
I'm right now living in Hong Kong and I'm designing a 100% free and open source micro controller.
<br/>
Although Hong Kong is inexpensive to live at in general, I need however at least a minimum income in order to buy food while I'm working full time on this micro processor.
<h2>The thing I'll gonna build</h2>
Since no one will pay me money for just saying ""I'll gonna build a 100% FOSS MCU"" here is a also a description of what I wanna make in detail
<br/>
<h3>Properties</h3>
The micro controller I wanna create will just be the first in a long row of release.
<br/>
The first one will basically be a 100% free and open 
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATmega328"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">ATMega</a> clone which means:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>It contains a RISC-V (32 bit) CPU core</li>
<li>It can replace the recent <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATmega328"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">ATMega</a> chip within the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">Arduino</a> boards</li>
<li>pin compatible to <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/devices/atmega32.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">ATMega32</a>
</li>
<li>TTL compatible (5V IO)</li>
<li>can drive an LED (or alike) on each pin</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features</h3>
This baby will contain the full spectrum of peripherals you would expect from a general purpose MCU:
<ul>
<li>ADC</li>
<li>DAC</li>
<li>PWM</li>
<li>I2C</li>
<li>SPI</li>
<li>UART</li>
<li>JTAG</li>
</ul>
<h2>Impact</h2>
The chip will redefine the standards of Chinese industry by setting totally new quality requirements in the future.<div>Hopefully it will sooner or later eliminate these many different CPU instruction sets and will lead all manufacturers to just use RISC-V as the instruction set for their CPU.  <h2>Risks</h2>
Of course Atmel or Infineon might come and make trouble because our chip ""looks too much like theirs"", but there is no patent or alike backing such claims.
We're less expensive and more open. Short: We are <b>better</b>

intercultural trainer and coach, now in a learning process in the Therapist
Training at Humaniversity, in the Netherlands. In my work, I´m busy with the
development of interpersonal and social skills: communication, goal setting, managing
changes, raising effectiveness of working together in an international
environment, and so on. In my private life, I am busy with my own (as well as
other people’s) personal growth. I´m also very much into travelling and
exploring different cultures.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I joined a
session at the Humaniversity in the Netherlands – a therapeutic community,
where people with different backgrounds come together to heal and relax, and to
experience their own “blind spots”. And I see that this is the way for me to
become a better trainer, a better therapist and a better human being.  I started with the Personal Education Course,
joined the Therapist Training after that, and I keep on going...</p>
<p>Now it´s time for me to
go one step further – I want to fully commit myself to the community and stay
in the house for <span>ONE WHOLE AND INTENSIVE YEAR.
</span></p>
<p>I´m about to start my
third year now. And as I always do: <b>I
want to experience it all!</b>  To do so,
I've decided to join the One Year Intensive Program in the Humaniversity, where
every weekend is filled with workshops of emotional work, every morning with
dynamic meditation. It’s about being present in the community every day of the
week.

exploring different cultures.
Two years ago, I joined a
session at the Humaniversity in the Netherlands – a therapeutic community,
where people with different backgrounds come together to heal and relax, and to
experience their own “blind spots”. And I see that this is the way for me to
become a better trainer, a better therapist and a better human being.  I started with the Personal Education Course,
joined the Therapist Training after that, and I keep on going...
Now it´s time for me to
go one step further – I want to fully commit myself to the community and stay
in the house for ONE WHOLE AND INTENSIVE YEAR.

I´m about to start my
third year now. And as I always do: I
want to experience it all!  To do so,
I've decided to join the One Year Intensive Program in the Humaniversity, where
every weekend is filled with workshops of emotional work, every morning with
dynamic meditation. It’s about being present in the community every day of the
week. No place to hide, no place to escape.What does it mean for me?

It means to find out all the benefits from being and
living in a therapeutic community, and to share them with you.


It means to stop working as a trainer and coach
outside as much as I did until now. Instead of this, I´ll be working in and for
the community.


Instead of traveling around the world, it is now all
about traveling inside to discover who I really am as a person and a therapist.


It means to challenge myself and the others being 24/7
together.


It means to be responsible and to give a picture of
how we all can benefit from being in a community.


It means to share my passion and beliefs with the
whole world without being afraid what that may cause…


It means to share my daily life experiences, as well
as the condition of my mind, body and soul with you. Together we will go through
the most beautiful and most tough times.


It means I do this for a simple reason: to encourage
the whole world to live together, to share, to express. To encounter. To make
friendships. And to love.


What does
it mean for you?


It means you will have access to a short video of the
community’s life, which I will record every week. Through that, I´ll share the
most important moments with you. I expect lots of feelings, ideas and thoughts
which you can use in your daily life and work.


It means you meet the community people and their
personal stories. You´ll see them, you´ll get to know them, and maybe you´ll
get inspired by them.


It means you will see how we work day by day, as well
how we work in a therapeutic session.


You will have the opportunity to see and talk to me
regularly, to check how life is going on, what I've learned and what I can
share with YOU and the world.


It means you will be a part of a pioneering, unique
project that´s based in a therapeutic community.


What does
it mean for the world?


It means a creation of a documentary about how living and working in the therapeutic commune
looks like.


It means real scenarios to get inspired - people’s
stories, which show that in order to feel fulfilled and loved people do belong
together, that they need each other and that THEY ARE LOVEABLE.


It means a unique opportunity to get involved with the
methods of therapeutic work according to the Humaniversity.

To get a taste of all
the different possibilities available for personal and communal growth.

How can you
support the project?



I´m happy for every contribution you're willing to
make to help bring this project to life! You can buy one or more of the
“products” I've prepared. They are rich and fully packed, so you can benefit
the most from it!


You can make a
contribution to make this campaign visible. Share it with your friends, people
you know, with whom you can, with everybody, so that this project becomes a
reality!



What is
the money for?


38.000 Euro are needed to cover the COSTS of the ONE
YEAR INTENSIVE PROGRAM for the whole year and to make the documentary a real project. I truly hope we can do it together - it
will be a unique project that will encourage people to join communities all
over the world to stay connected to one another and to become more fulfilled
and loving - just perfect human beings!

What
happens if…


If I do not reach my goal of 38.000 Euros, I´ll use
the raised money to complete my education as a Humaniversity therapist without
continuing on with the One Year Intensive Program. This will also allow me to
continue working with people as Therapist and Trainer, so I can share my experience and give it back to
the world.

I´m grateful for your contribution! And I´m looking forward to you! You can check me out by visiting my website: www.barbarabartczak.com or my travel blog www.barbarabartczak.wordpress.com

<p><b> MY CAMPAIGN AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT</b></p>
<p>While still studying, I tried to think much on what to do after my studies. So I decided to start my small tourist company through which I can assist  tourists who visit Tanzania with its National parks and the highest mountain in Africa, Mount Kilimanjaro. Commencing a tourist company is very expensive as the things necessary needed to start the company include having enough vehicles to carry tourists, Insurance, workers, and a license. I have created a website (<a href=""http://steppedogsadventures.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://steppedogsadventures.com/</a>) with some information about Tanzania’s tourism business. All I require now now is to advertise my company, registration for my company, buying some vehicles which I am required to have  to be considered qualified for registration,  which itself is very expensive. What I can ask from you is your support. sponsorship and assistance in making my business prosper and my dream come true.</p>

<br/><h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>It’s a shocking fact that three out of every four Sub-Saharan African communities do not have access to electricity. This means in Southern Africa about 650 million people have no safe access to
energy to light and power their homes, clinics, schools and businesses. In
rural areas that means about 80% of the population!</p>
<p>Our campaign wants to change this one village at a time.</p>
<p>We're starting with Xaxa, ( Location 19.8831° S, 21.0788° E) a village in the parish of Qangwa, roughly 300 miles away from the nearest tarmac road. From the money raised we will install the appropriate number of solar powered street lights to light the main road, clinic, school and marketplace.</p>
<p>The community has a population of approximately 1000. Community’s facilities include a small primary school, clinic, social welfare office, veterinary clinic and tribal community office.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary 

It’s a shocking fact that three out of every four Sub-Saharan African communities do not have access to electricity. This means in Southern Africa about 650 million people have no safe access to
energy to light and power their homes, clinics, schools and businesses. In
rural areas that means about 80% of the population!
Our campaign wants to change this one village at a time.
We're starting with Xaxa, ( Location 19.8831° S, 21.0788° E) a village in the parish of Qangwa, roughly 300 miles away from the nearest tarmac road. From the money raised we will install the appropriate number of solar powered street lights to light the main road, clinic, school and marketplace.
The community has a population of approximately 1000. Community’s facilities include a small primary school, clinic, social welfare office, veterinary clinic and tribal community office.


Most villages have no streetlights which means many people do not feel safe going outside at night due to the possibility of assault, robbery, rape and even the threat of being attacked by wild animals.
Local clinics close at sundown or are lit by paraffin lamps or candles and school children have to leave school when the sun goes down.
After dark most children cannot do their homework, many have to rely on kerosene, paraffin or candles. But these are inefficient, produce polluting fumes and carbon emissions and are costly to run. They also the cause thousands of accidents each year, with damage to people, homes and communities.

Local markets have to close at sundown. Which reduces the amount of productive hours which traders can work to help take their families out of poverty.


This is why we’re asking you to support our March for Lights campaign to make a real difference to lives of those in Xaxa, located in the parish of Qangwa.




   What We Need & What You Get 
Our initial target is £7,500 ($10,000) – Your donations will provide the latest generation of solar streetlights to transform the village at night.
  We’ll focus on the main street, the local clinic, school and marketplace, each light being addressed by our partners What3Words (https://what3words.com) making each light easily found and accessible in a remote part of the world. 


The Impact 
We are here to make a difference which is why we are asking for your support. There is new generation of solar powered  lighting and equipment  for homes, schools and clinics which are reliable, quick to install, free to run and easy and cheap to maintain. 
They have the power to totally transform the lives of some of the poorest people in the world. 
We already know the impact solar can make, last year we installed solar home packs and solar streetlights in Sizanani, South Africa.

<p>It is my passion to introduce African culinary culture into the international arena. My country of origin was the Congo and I came here to the U.S. 20 years ago as a refugee. Because I was raised in three different continents, being Africa, Europe and America, I picked up many cultural backgrounds of flavor including my study of interior and fashion design in Belgium. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">My inspiration came from my mom as she lovingly taught me an appreciation for the cooking arts, new flavors, techniques and the presentation of the food in a way that uses my gifts and love for food.  I also noticed in coming to America the lack of the showcase of African food and it's healing value to body, mind and spirit. I also noticed how much Americans love to eat and I wanted introduce all the recipes my mother taught me to the people around me and fill both needs.</span></p>
<p>It is my dream is to have my mama's recipes known and loved around the world. In order to fulfill this dream I reach out to those who love international flavors and want to see more culinary diversity in the world to join with me in support of this endeavor by investing in my dream.</p>
<p>In order to make this dream happen, I need the professional equipment to fill my unique gifts of African packaged flavor to the world, such as, Pili-Pili Sauce and Ginger Punch. This high tech equipment will give me the capacity to mass produce the product and have it shipped all over the world where there is a high demand for that already. Products such as ginger and the ingredients in my Pili-Pili Sauce are well known for health and have been used from Asia to Africa for centuries and have proved themselves to be of numerous benefits health wise.  </p>
<p>Having this professional equipment would allow me to open the door to the international food lovers without them having to fly to Africa to test and discover these flavors, by bringing Africa to them. It will also support us as a small business in the U.S. as well as supporting the Utah community by being able to export these products all over the world.

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The funding will go toward the purchase of the needed filling equipment which is $50,000.

<p>Any funding received for this cause of purchasing the filling equipment will be kept in an account for that specific purpose only, until we reach the desired amount to purchase it.  I will continue to make my unique products and share my recipes and my vision for the future, but I will not give up on my dream.</p>

<p>In a world of ever-increasing demand for products and services, the internet has brought us an exceptional avenue of which we (the consumer) can shop. Although bricks and mortar are still widely embraced in the United States, Ecommerce and delivery of such goods has become even more widely accepted from us… and expected. Through all the industries and new opportunities Ecommerce has brought, one’s imagination could only be the barrier to what is possible in the world today. For us, we imagine a time where any consumer could open their electronic device and have access to the hundred thousand + products each local grocer has to offer. And not only that, but to be able to order a delivery on those products any time of the day, hassle free, and at an affordable rate for everyone. Unfortunately, for the average consumer in the United States that time has not yet happened and we’ve seen a few players burn some early adopters where it has. Fortunately however, we have an opportunity to learn from those mistakes and pursue a future in on-demand delivery; a future that is almost certain to happen in all industries of services.</p>
<p>I started this company because I have personally witnessed many times, a perfect scenario for this type of service, and unfortunately it was not available. I feel most people would agree with that and probably have experienced the same. We are not only making grocery shopping hassle-free, but we are offering consumers the chance to free up their schedule and open opportunities of which may not have happened otherwise.  We truly believe that a large amount of families could benefit from a service like this... and that is why we will make it happen. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>For us to get this service up and running, we need to develop a website and an app. Since these platforms will be advanced, they will cost more money than my team and I had anticipated. We need $10,000 to be able to develop the website and get started.  After using the $10,000 we will work in getting the service up by the summer time of this year!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Along with a delivery service for your groceries, we will offer awesome promotions for each week. Depending on the time of the year will depend on what types of deals we have going, but rest assured... they will be awesome!</li> <li>Even if my team and I don't reach our goal for the funding, we will use every dime of it towards developing the website... and then we will search for more capital till we can get it done. That is our barrier we need to overcome to get the business started. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The impact this type of service could bring to the US is larger than we thought. We currently have a few competitors and the significance they have brought to people is extraordinary. The thing however, is they charge prices that most people (including myself) could not afford. I don't really appreciate that, and because of that I would like to make it a reality for everyone. When anybody and everybody can get their groceries at the click of a few buttons, you know the world is moving in an awesome direction :) </p> <ul> <li> We think this is really awesome because it makes life so much easier. Taking out the necessity of grocery shopping (yourself) can truly benefit every individual in their own way. For me, it relieves stress knowing that i don't have to worry about heading to the grocery store after work or on the weekends. </li>
<li>We are making this for you, not for us. We believe people deserve a service of this caliber and will continue to work for it until it's a reality. The impact could be so large that it affects millions of lives in the United States each year. </li>
</ul>
</div><div> <p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>As a company entering the market 3 years after the first player, we have both strengths of our own, and that we can draw upon from their mistakes, but also weaknesses from entering later, and some that we may never foresee coming until operating. With that being said, we understand there will be risks involved. Most notably, is the management of this project. The mere concept is an idea that everyone has dreamed of and thought about, so there is nothing completely unique about it. However... the management of the process, the pricing of the service, and the wages we pay our couriers for their customer service challenges is what will ultimately determine whether customers will like the business or not. We understand that we already have competitors, but if anyone were to read about how they treat their courier staff, how they charge you a large markup fee on the goods, and how they continue to increases prices and cut staff for increasing their bottom line... they would understand there needs to be significant improvements in the services out there. We (ShopLyft) are the ones who want to do it.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We aren't just looking for some money to get started... we are looking for awesome friends to support us and the word!

We are open to all ideas and look forward to what you can come up with! And please share the idea with other friends of yours. We are nothing without your support.

In a world of ever-increasing demand for products and services, the internet has brought us an exceptional avenue of which we (the consumer) can shop. Although bricks and mortar are still widely embraced in the United States, Ecommerce and delivery of such goods has become even more widely accepted from us… and expected. Through all the industries and new opportunities Ecommerce has brought, one’s imagination could only be the barrier to what is possible in the world today. For us, we imagine a time where any consumer could open their electronic device and have access to the hundred thousand + products each local grocer has to offer. And not only that, but to be able to order a delivery on those products any time of the day, hassle free, and at an affordable rate for everyone. Unfortunately, for the average consumer in the United States that time has not yet happened and we’ve seen a few players burn some early adopters where it has. Fortunately however, we have an opportunity to learn from those mistakes and pursue a future in on-demand delivery; a future that is almost certain to happen in all industries of services.
I started this company because I have personally witnessed many times, a perfect scenario for this type of service, and unfortunately it was not available. I feel most people would agree with that and probably have experienced the same. We are not only making grocery shopping hassle-free, but we are offering consumers the chance to free up their schedule and open opportunities of which may not have happened otherwise.  We truly believe that a large amount of families could benefit from a service like this... and that is why we will make it happen.    What We Need & What You Get  For us to get this service up and running, we need to develop a website and an app. Since these platforms will be advanced, they will cost more money than my team and I had anticipated. We need $10,000 to be able to develop the website and get started.  After using the $10,000 we will work in getting the service up by the summer time of this year!


Along with a delivery service for your groceries, we will offer awesome promotions for each week. Depending on the time of the year will depend on what types of deals we have going, but rest assured... they will be awesome! Even if my team and I don't reach our goal for the funding, we will use every dime of it towards developing the website... and then we will search for more capital till we can get it done. That is our barrier we need to overcome to get the business started.     The Impact The impact this type of service could bring to the US is larger than we thought. We currently have a few competitors and the significance they have brought to people is extraordinary. The thing however, is they charge prices that most people (including myself) could not afford. I don't really appreciate that, and because of that I would like to make it a reality for everyone. When anybody and everybody can get their groceries at the click of a few buttons, you know the world is moving in an awesome direction :)    We think this is really awesome because it makes life so much easier. Taking out the necessity of grocery shopping (yourself) can truly benefit every individual in their own way. For me, it relieves stress knowing that i don't have to worry about heading to the grocery store after work or on the weekends. 
We are making this for you, not for us. We believe people deserve a service of this caliber and will continue to work for it until it's a reality. The impact could be so large that it affects millions of lives in the United States each year.

<p>My name is Kyle Harrop and I'm the owner of Horus Aged Ales. I have been homebrewing for the past ten years, where I have received dozens of awards. I have tasted nearly 18,000 different beers in the past decade. I have written reviews in various online beer and food publications. I have an Instagram account, floydster_horus, that shows my brewing endeavors, all the different great beers I have come across recently, and the craft beer events I have been fortunate enough to be a part of. Along with my wife, Laurel and daughter, Willow, we are embarking on the journey of opening a craft beer blendery/brewery.</p>
<p>What does Horus mean? Horus is the legendary falcon-headed god of Egypt. The name is an ode to my father, Bob, who is a falconer in California. I grew up around various species of birds of prey and considered them my feathered siblings. I credit my dad for getting me into craft beer as he was an enthusiast as soon as Stone Brewing Company became a fixture in the 1990s. All of the beer offerings from Horus Aged Ales will be named after a different bird of prey! </p>
<p>Why barrel aged beer? Barrel aged beer has intrigued me since the day I tasted my very first one. The mix of oak and wine or spirits with a delicious base beer offers such a unique drinking experience because of its complexity and exclusivity. Even with the same beer and same type of barrel, the beer in each one will have subtle differences and truly be one of a kind. The possibilities of flavors are unlimited and the craft beer world has just began to scratch the surface in my opinion. Horus will set out to provide combinations of flavors that have not been done before using local ingredients from local and regional farmers such as aronia berries, prickly pear, mulberries, rhubarb, black walnuts, and many more. Some of my most successful homebrew offerings will be replicated and will include a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with Wisconsin maple syrup, wildflower honey, and Madagascar Vanilla Bean, as well as wild ales using peaches, nectarines, dragonfruit, and passionfruit.</p>
<p>I fell in love with barrel aged beer in 2006 after trying Lost Abbey Angel's Share in San Marcos, California for the first time. The days of drinking mass produced lagers were gone and I became a craft beer geek at that very moment. I started trading for different barrel aged beers across the United States and tried to get my hands on every different one I could find. What I noticed about most barrel aged beers was that they were simply a brewery's imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels. This flavor profile slowly became repetitive to me and I wondered why more breweries were not adding things like coffee, chocolate, vanilla, fruit, and spices to barrels to make these barrel aged offerings even more complex. So, I started making these kinds of beers on my own at home. They were very well received by friends and family, at local homebrew festivals, and even among professional brewers in the craft beer industry. Hence, the idea of Horus Aged Ales came to fruition. While there has been a small push for some to do these types of beers in the past few years, the market is still in need of unique barrel aged beers.</p>
<p>Our goal is to create a small blendery/brewery that focuses on small batch barrel aged beers using as many locally sourced ingredients as possible. We want to make unique beers that we are excited to drink ourselves and share them with the rest of you. We want to bring the farm-to-table restaurant experience to you through a bottle of unique barrel aged beer instead by using fruits directly from farmers. We are reaching out to possible contributors to make our dreams come true and get Horus Aged Ales up and running.</p>
<p>We are looking for $40,000 that will go towards rare oak barrels consisting of previously used bourbon barrels including Pappy Van Winkle, French Bordeaux wine barrels, Cognac barrels, puncheons, and a foeder. These unique barrels will make our recipes even more complex because of the amazing character from the spirit or wine that was used in them before. If we exceed the goal for crowdfunding, the money will go towards even more barrels, therefore we will be making more beer. The initial plan is to start with 100 different barrels, but that number can grow dramatically with your help.</p>
<p>The craft beer market is growing and our products will be a great addition to the portfolio. Vermont has Hill Farmstead, Oregon has De Garde, Wisconsin has Funk Factory, and Missouri has Side Project. Please help fund our dream of opening Horus Aged Ales!</p>

<h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
<p>Roads Less Traveled - Africa is all about family, we are Gus, Ri, Caela and Loki. As avid travelers we have decided to embark on setting up our own travel business to share some of the magical places and moments we’ve had along our road!</p>
<p>Our real focus is making sure that families have a truly unique African experience that is still affordable; unlike the many large tour operators we want to custom make all our tours with added extras to ensure each family’s trip is theirs and theirs alone. We don’t want quantity we really would like to make it all about the quality!</p>
<p>Gus grew up in Africa and has traveled to most of Southern and East Africa over the years and has spent much of his time in the African bush. Risette set out from the Netherlands in 2010 to experience and learn more of what Africa had to offer, she still hasn’t gone home yet! Caela, at 20 months old has lived in the African bush, traveled to Mozambique and lived at the mouth of the mighty Limpopo River, visited Swaziland and much of South Africa and is now living in the awesome province of KwaZulu Natal. Loki as our faithful companion is never far away and loyally by our side on as many trips as possible!</p>

<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>After 3 months of setup and investment from our savings, we have completed the start-up company basics – vision, area of focus, registration and a solid foundation, we need to move to the next and very critical level.</p>
<p>This next level includes expanding on the small amount of marketing done thus far. With the $13,000 we will be able push our brand and product to travel agents and most importantly, the general public. It is essential that we improve our exposure in order to compete with the many larger operators out there.</p>
<p>Another key area of our product and who we are, is ensuring that all the places we offer to our guests are unique and have that “little something” extra. Therefore, we need to expand our search for these “hidden gems”. Your contributions will allow us to reach more places to ensure our guests have magical experiences!</p>
<p>In short, branding, marketing and exposure along with contacting potential partners is what we feel is required to kick us off completely!</p>
<p>You can help us realise our dream by purchasing one of our fantastic and unique perks, like our branded travel mug, custom travel journals or a fantastic African goodie pack. Always wanted to come to South Africa? This is your chance to help us and get the trip you've always dreamed of! Please contact us if you have any questions about the trips. </p>

As a kid growing up my father, my brothers (Kenneth Thorns, Brandon Washington, Danny Gorrer and Ivy Brown), and I had many favorite past times but one of the countless greats was the backyard barbeques that we use to do together. Most people only barbequed on special holidays but anytime my dad desired to get the boys together he would have a backyard barbeque. These childhood and adolescent experiences cultivated a desire within me to become a pit master.<br/>   The more I smoked, however, the more I recognized the pleasure I obtained from seeing people truly appreciate the food I had prepared. This feeling turned into the fuel that pushed me to start perfecting my skill; as well as investing into my hobby at this time.

As a kid growing up my father, my brothers (Kenneth Thorns, Brandon Washington, Danny Gorrer and Ivy Brown), and I had many favorite past times but one of the countless greats was the backyard barbeques that we use to do together. Most people only barbequed on special holidays but anytime my dad desired to get the boys together he would have a backyard barbeque. These childhood and adolescent experiences cultivated a desire within me to become a pit master.   The more I smoked, however, the more I recognized the pleasure I obtained from seeing people truly appreciate the food I had prepared. This feeling turned into the fuel that pushed me to start perfecting my skill; as well as investing into my hobby at this time. Furthermore, four years ago I began barbequing on a more professional level by catering for events. My passion for perfection continued to grow and this passion caused me to begin creating my own: seasoning, links, and sauces.    I moved to Tulsa to attend Oral Roberts University for college and I thought that this passion would have to die because I had to start over.

<p><strong>Self introduction and  background.</strong></p>
<p>UDWA was established and registered in 1986 purposely to address the impediments to progress in the locality. They constitute among others; unsustainable resource use,high deforestation, poor environmental management, malnutrition among pregnant women with disabilities and children, low tree planting response, conflicts between the community people and National Environment Management Authority (NEMA) ,gaps in provision of clean water , community health , Sanitation and Hygiene services.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of the campaign</strong></p>
<p>    The campaign aims to support beekeeping for livelihood improvement and food security through beekeeping and tree planting among marginalized youths and people with disabilities in Mukono district, by supporting 100 households by the end of the project, and to promote environmental conservation through awareness campaigns and advocacy in Mukono district.</p>
<p>This campaign is important in that it will benefit the community and their house holds by improving their socio-economic status and food security .All the farmers in the project area will benefit from pollination of crops by bees .Bee keeping will increase crop yields and improve house hold incomes and diet, Increase on school attendance where disabled parents will now have the ability and capacity to take their children to school because the project will teach them how to become self reliant and engage in gainful and environmental friendly employment</p>
<p><br/><strong> The magnitude of what contributors will help us achieve.</strong></p>
<p>contributors will assist to the extent of providing support in the procurement of some inputs like timber, apiary specialized equipment including uniform, smokers, extraction equipment as well as sourcing any other inputs which we cannot get or improvise in-kind.

<ul>
<li>The project targets, particularly marginalized people with disabilities, parents of people with disabilities as well as vulnerable community people in dire need for intervention. These people are susceptible to suffering, brought about by lack of contingencies to enable them overcome challenges of life. Their state warrants the emergence of the project for their own good. People of all ranges are considered to participate, with respect to gender. We all realize the impact of environmental degradation and its global effects that do not discriminate perpetrators from innocent others. So by this action the whole global community stands to benefit from a good environment and more food production as well as a settled population that do not look at migration as a solution.</li>
<li> On record we are proud to mention that in the past 30 years of the organization's existence, projects related to community livelihood support incorporated with environmental protection and sustainability have been successfully implemented by our organization.

<p>For 15 years, I've traveled the world as a professional dancer and instructor. I've been on stage with artists including Missy Elliott and J.Lo, on screen for productions such as American's Best Dance Crew and the VMAs with Fanny Pak, toured with World Of Dance, choreographed for high-profile brands like BMW and Infiniti, founded Maker Empire, and have taught at dozens of studios around the world. And I currently direct the non-profit dance company Culture Shock Los Angeles!</p>
<p>Knowing first hand how important the studio space is, I've made it my personal mission to create an environment <strong>made</strong><i><strong> by </strong></i><strong>artists</strong><i><strong>, for </strong></i><strong>artists</strong><i><strong>. </strong></i></p>

<p>I've spent the past 12 years cultivating dancers and dance programs from the ground up – and now I'm ready to plant new seeds. My previous studio's staff and I grew the roster from 100 to over 400 students, producing 10 recitals, 6 in-house adult dance showcases, numerous workshops and intensives, and co-producing Maxt Out Dance Competition for 4 seasons. I am currently in my second term as the Downtown Alhambra Business Association President.</p>
<p>With all these experiences, I'm confident that I will be able to create even more opportunities for artists of all ages at Elements Dance Space.<br/><br/><strong>Maybe it's the Mommy in me...</strong></p>
<p>With 2 sons, it's really showing that I love fostering the growth of others – both in a personal and professional context. </p>

I'm Beau.

For 15 years, I've traveled the world as a professional dancer and instructor. I've been on stage with artists including Missy Elliott and J.Lo, on screen for productions such as American's Best Dance Crew and the VMAs with Fanny Pak, toured with World Of Dance, choreographed for high-profile brands like BMW and Infiniti, founded Maker Empire, and have taught at dozens of studios around the world. And I currently direct the non-profit dance company Culture Shock Los Angeles!
Knowing first hand how important the studio space is, I've made it my personal mission to create an environment made by artists, for artists. 
Because I know... Being an artist is hard enough.
Elements Dance Space will cater to us. 
Hi! I'm Tu. 

I've spent the past 12 years cultivating dancers and dance programs from the ground up – and now I'm ready to plant new seeds. My previous studio's staff and I grew the roster from 100 to over 400 students, producing 10 recitals, 6 in-house adult dance showcases, numerous workshops and intensives, and co-producing Maxt Out Dance Competition for 4 seasons. I am currently in my second term as the Downtown Alhambra Business Association President.
With all these experiences, I'm confident that I will be able to create even more opportunities for artists of all ages at Elements Dance Space.Maybe it's the Mommy in me...
With 2 sons, it's really showing that I love fostering the growth of others – both in a personal and professional context. 
 
Beau + Tu = The Synergy of Passion and Action
Together, we want to create Elements Dance Space, where dancers and artists in the Greater Los Angeles / Southern California area can find everything they want and need.
 

What We Need & What You Get

We have a 10,000 sq ft. space 
We need $100,000 to turn that into Elements Dance Space

Will provide regular dance classes and programs, both for youth and adults

<h3>Who We Are and How We Got Here:</h3>
<p>Mira's Homemade was founded in 2012 with the idea that snack foods could and should be simple and healthy. Mira has always loved preparing food for family and friends and has spent years experimenting to make dishes that are optimally nutritious, ethically conscious, and fantastically delicious. Frustrated by the complicated ingredient lists and dubious nutrition of most commercially available snack foods, Mira developed a simple, crowd-pleasing granola and started making it available to her community. Almost before we knew it, Mira's Homemade was proudly sitting on the aisle of natural grocers all over the Mid-Adlantic region. The reaction to our granola has been inspiring and encouraging, and we have had an amazing four years of learning and discovery. Now we hope to adapt to what we've learned and lay a strong foundation for future expansion so that we can continue to make healthy snacks our friends and global neighbors can feel good about eating. </p>
<h3>Obstacles You Can Help Us Overcome:</h3>
<p>We are a small, family-run company and, true to our name, Mira herself still makes and packages everything by hand. While this is rewarding, it doesn't leave a lot of time or resources for the other demands of the business. Right now, we can just keep up with the contracts we have, but we lack the resources to take things much further. That's where your contribution can really make a difference! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How We're Going to Do It:</h3>
<p>We love hearing from our customers and we consider their feedback very closely. One thing we've learned is that people really enjoy the versatility of our product and they connect to it as a snack food more than as a granola. We've also had requests for smaller-portioned packaging and encouraging interest in an expanded product line. These are great ideas, and we believe that they will be beneficial to our long-term success. In order to take our company to the next level, we are hoping to raise twenty-five thousand dollars for new packaging, new equipment to accommodate the smaller bags, and payroll for an employee to help meet increased demand. This injection of capital will boost us to a level that is more sustainable by streamlining our production process and reducing costs. Once we achieve this goal, we hope to distribute our granola on a national (or even global) scale, expand our product line, and continue our mission to create snacks that do 'the least amount of harm to, and the most amount of good for, animals, humans, and the natural resources on our precious planet.'</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Support Vegan, Organic, etc.?</h3>
<p>Many people are searching for more sustainable, ethical, or healthier dietary options. Some people are required to eat certain kinds of food due to a medical condition. Regardless of why people choose or need to eat these foods, the fact is that these options are becoming more popular.</p>
<p><a href=""http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=8659&amp;catId=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=8659...</a></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/Organic/marketincrease73001.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/O...</a></p>
<p>We believe our snackable granola will appeal to a wide audience and grow into a major player in the health food industry.</p>

Once we achieve this goal, we hope to distribute our granola on a national (or even global) scale, expand our product line, and continue our mission to create snacks that do 'the least amount of harm to, and the most amount of good for, animals, humans, and the natural resources on our precious planet.'


Why Support Vegan, Organic, etc.?
Many people are searching for more sustainable, ethical, or healthier dietary options. Some people are required to eat certain kinds of food due to a medical condition. Regardless of why people choose or need to eat these foods, the fact is that these options are becoming more popular.
http://vegnews.com/articles/page.do?pageId=8659...
https://www.organicconsumers.org/old_articles/O...
We believe our snackable granola will appeal to a wide audience and grow into a major player in the health food industry.

<p>Mēs, NeZvēra komanda, vēlamies atvērt pirmo 100% vegānisku ēdināšanas vietu Rīgā, lai padarītu šo ētisko un videi draudzīgo dzīvesveidu pieejamāku Latvijas iedzīvotājiem. Pagājušā gada novembrī vairāk kā 1000 Latvijas iedzīvotāju pieņēma izaicinājumu kļūt par vegāniem uz vienu mēnesi, kas liecina par plašu interesi par šo dzīvesveidu mūsu valstī!</p>
<p>NeZvēra galvenais mērķis ir sniegt Tev gardus, apetelīgus vegāniskus burgerus, lai apmierinātu pat nezvēra apetīti! Izstrādājot receptes ar profesionāļu palīdzību, esam nonākušas pie labākiem risinājumiem, apvienojot veselīgas sastāvdaļas un neaizmirstami lielisku garšu!</p>
<p>Viss NeZvēra ēdiens tiek mājražots, ir lielākoties vietējs un pagatavots no sezonālām sastāvdaļām. Īsāk sakot - mēs esam no nākotnes!</p>
<p>NeZvērs parūpēsies par to, lai visi ēdieni, kas netiks izlietoti, nonāk to rokās, kam tie visvairāk vajadzīgi. Mēs esam par labo darbu darīšanu un atkritumu mazināšanu!</p>
<p>NeZvēra komanda sastāv no trim jaunām dāmām, kam rūp vegānisms, ēdiens un ekoloģija. Viktorija ir ieguvusi izglītību medicīnas inženierijas un fizikas jomā, Agate –viesnīcu menedžmentu un viesmīlību internacionālā augstskolā, un Katrīna mācās par biologu.</p>
<p>NeZvērs bija viena no uzvarētājkomandām sociālo uzņēmēju akseleratora Erasmus+ atbalstītajā programmā „Socifaction” 2015. gadā. Mēs esam izgājušas apmācības par sociālās uzņēmējdarbības plānošanu, mārketingu, piedalījušās mentorēšanas programmā, esam testējušas savus produktus un ieguvušas izbraukumu ēdināšanas pieredzi. Kopš tā laika esam piedalījušās lielākos un mazākos pasākumos, un mobilā virtuve padarītu NeZvēru vēl pieejamāku!</p>
<p><b>Kas mums ir vajadzīgs</b></p>
<p>Mums ir vajadzīga Tava palīdzība, lai NeZvērs kļūtu mobils! Mūs ir uzmeklējusi ideāla virtuve uz riteņiem, kas ir gatava  pārvadāt NeZvēra labumus uz festivāliem un pasākumiem izsalkušu jauniešu pūļiem!</p>
<p>Mūsu mērķis ir uzkrāt 10 tūkstošus Eiro, lai segtu nepieciešamos izdevumus, kas ir saistīti ar izbraukuma ēdināšanas uzņēmējdarbības sākšanu. Šajos izdevumos ietilpst mobilās virtuves iegāde, dizaina un aprīkošanas izmaksas kā arī ar uzņēmējdarbības sākšanu saisītas izmaksas.</p>

Pagājušā gada novembrī vairāk kā 1000 Latvijas iedzīvotāju pieņēma izaicinājumu kļūt par vegāniem uz vienu mēnesi, kas liecina par plašu interesi par šo dzīvesveidu mūsu valstī!
NeZvēra galvenais mērķis ir sniegt Tev gardus, apetelīgus vegāniskus burgerus, lai apmierinātu pat nezvēra apetīti! Izstrādājot receptes ar profesionāļu palīdzību, esam nonākušas pie labākiem risinājumiem, apvienojot veselīgas sastāvdaļas un neaizmirstami lielisku garšu!
Viss NeZvēra ēdiens tiek mājražots, ir lielākoties vietējs un pagatavots no sezonālām sastāvdaļām. Īsāk sakot - mēs esam no nākotnes!
NeZvērs parūpēsies par to, lai visi ēdieni, kas netiks izlietoti, nonāk to rokās, kam tie visvairāk vajadzīgi. Mēs esam par labo darbu darīšanu un atkritumu mazināšanu!
NeZvēra komanda sastāv no trim jaunām dāmām, kam rūp vegānisms, ēdiens un ekoloģija. Viktorija ir ieguvusi izglītību medicīnas inženierijas un fizikas jomā, Agate –viesnīcu menedžmentu un viesmīlību internacionālā augstskolā, un Katrīna mācās par biologu.
NeZvērs bija viena no uzvarētājkomandām sociālo uzņēmēju akseleratora Erasmus+ atbalstītajā programmā „Socifaction” 2015. gadā. Mēs esam izgājušas apmācības par sociālās uzņēmējdarbības plānošanu, mārketingu, piedalījušās mentorēšanas programmā, esam testējušas savus produktus un ieguvušas izbraukumu ēdināšanas pieredzi. Kopš tā laika esam piedalījušās lielākos un mazākos pasākumos, un mobilā virtuve padarītu NeZvēru vēl pieejamāku!
Kas mums ir vajadzīgs
Mums ir vajadzīga Tava palīdzība, lai NeZvērs kļūtu mobils! Mūs ir uzmeklējusi ideāla virtuve uz riteņiem, kas ir gatava  pārvadāt NeZvēra labumus uz festivāliem un pasākumiem izsalkušu jauniešu pūļiem!
Mūsu mērķis ir uzkrāt 10 tūkstošus Eiro, lai segtu nepieciešamos izdevumus, kas ir saistīti ar izbraukuma ēdināšanas uzņēmējdarbības sākšanu. Šajos izdevumos ietilpst mobilās virtuves iegāde, dizaina un aprīkošanas izmaksas kā arī ar uzņēmējdarbības sākšanu saisītas izmaksas.
Palīdzi NeZvēram, pastāstot par šo kampaņu saviem draugiem un ģimenei!
                                                                                                                             P.S.
Saistībā ar Paypal uzstādītajiem ierobežojumiem, mēs laipni lūdzam Tevi izvēlēties maksāšanas opciju ar kredītkarti.
Valūta tika izvēlēta saistībā ar Indiegogo prasībām un ierobežojumiem. Kampaņas beigās visi savāktie līdzekļi tiks pārvērsti Eiro.
Atsevišķi vēlamies pateikties Klāvam Lorim par brīnišķigu video;
Paldies Rombo un Sanitai par ieguldīto darbu NeZvēra logo tapšanā;
Paldies Jānim Andersonam par ieguldījumu mūsu idejās un mobilās virtuves dizainu;
Paldies Remzijam Rimkeitam par teksta ierunāšanu un savu Kalifornijas pieskārienu mūsu recepšu veidošanā;
Paldies mūsu mentorei, Elīzei Ķiberei par labiem padomiem, receptēm un atbalstu!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Aiki-Community</h2>
<p>Our purpose is to return to Earth as its caretakers and to utilize the spiritual practice of Aikido to maintain communal harmony, connect to the divine source, and to realize our potential as human beings.</p>
<h3>Founder,</h3>
<h2><strong>Mark Hughes</strong></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471481030/g779fqkrevjinvbe9gqy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Mark has been studying in many areas of the human experience, including mythology, transpersonal psychology, mystical experiences, eastern and western philosophy, and comparative religions. Mark has determined that Aikido is the key ingredient to create his dream of a harmonious community that lives close to nature.</p>
<h3>Aiki-Community Structure</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our community is based on the Aikido live-in student program in Iwama, Japan. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473112925/eiis81wkcbibnsslfdgu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>We will keep a daily schedule that delegates work, training times, and other basic duties as they need to be completed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473116164/kdrfylxzemz91eu1wdhi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The remainder of the day will be spend doing as the individual community member sees fit. Our purpose is the sustainable freedom of mankind.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473116184/saqrdn1pfoan9ygomxip.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We will utilize sustainable building practices like cobb, wattle and dob, straw-bale, etc, to reduce costs and our impact on the environment.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473116219/ar2wynachuye2lvldtfm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In addition to our raised bed gardens, our plan is to build a food forest by using permaculture. For off season organic farming, we will use aquaponics. </p>

<p>Some of our perks include recognition on our website, personalized copies of <i>The Art of Peace </i>by Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido, personalized video's dedicated to you, and the chance to reserve a spot as a live-in student after we become established.</p>
<h3>Obstacles</h3>

</div></div>","Aiki-Community
Our purpose is to return to Earth as its caretakers and to utilize the spiritual practice of Aikido to maintain communal harmony, connect to the divine source, and to realize our potential as human beings.
Founder,
Mark Hughes

Mark has been studying in many areas of the human experience, including mythology, transpersonal psychology, mystical experiences, eastern and western philosophy, and comparative religions. Mark has determined that Aikido is the key ingredient to create his dream of a harmonious community that lives close to nature.
Aiki-Community Structure
 
Our community is based on the Aikido live-in student program in Iwama, Japan. 


 
We will keep a daily schedule that delegates work, training times, and other basic duties as they need to be completed.

The remainder of the day will be spend doing as the individual community member sees fit. Our purpose is the sustainable freedom of mankind.

We will utilize sustainable building practices like cobb, wattle and dob, straw-bale, etc, to reduce costs and our impact on the environment.

In addition to our raised bed gardens, our plan is to build a food forest by using permaculture. For off season organic farming, we will use aquaponics. 

 
What Your Gift Buys
Your contribution helps to secure our core team, purchase land, and build basic structures to begin developing an agricultural community.

Some of our perks include recognition on our website, personalized copies of The Art of Peace by Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido, personalized video's dedicated to you, and the chance to reserve a spot as a live-in student after we become established.
Obstacles
Creating a community like this is not as difficult as some may assume. Human beings do not need very much to be satisfied. It is just that we have made our lives to be so complicated and based our economy on human weaknesses that we are more sickly and depressed as ever. 
The simple life is the life a human yearns for. To live close to nature, to be a part of a community, to learn and grow, and to have time to appreciate life. We hope that through the live-in student program, people can see that a sustainable future full of abundance and happiness is the best way for the future.

<h3>Stacey's Sweets History... so far:</h3>
<p>In December of 2012 I was facing a crossroads of my life. Post divorce, working full time at an unfulfilling job and not making the commission promised, not able to pay my bills and wanting MUCH MORE out of life.  Full disclosure, within a week's time I made the decision to declare personal bankruptcy (very low moment for me) and also decided to sell these amazing Original Chocolate Chip Bombs that I had made for many friends and family over about 15 years.  Well let me tell you, the orders started coming, flavor requests were made and I pulled my bootstraps up and got to work!  This empire has become much more than I ever imagined it would be.  Yes, I hustle like a crazy woman but the SUPPORT I receive from my Sugar Baby Customers and this community is unparalleled.  A couple of years ago you guys helped me get my epic, pink Cookie Cart, aka CC.  I love her so much and she has so much fun in public and is a total traffic stopper.</p>
<p>My brand has grown so much and the orders have greatly increased though retail shops, corporate accounts, private label Bourbon Bombs (William Sonoma is VERY interested!), charity events, school functions and web orders, that I'm asking for help once again.   ""Go to a bank"" you might say, well banks are fussy and not quite ready to loan much to someone that's rebuilding their credit with very sporadic income.  </p>
<p>I've been able to obtain my commercial license by utilizing other commercial kitchens.  Well... it's time for my OWN BAKERY!  Don't you agree?  Every single bit of funds raised will help with the build out of the space and purchase of equipment for the bakery.  The space is small and very manageable.  I will have some fantastic, flexible landlords and it's grouped with other businesses so we can support each other.  To say I'm excited is the understatement of the year.</p>
<p>There are different levels of perks and goodies that come with donations.  I will have a super cute wall in the bakery dedicated to ALL of my supporter's name and business logos as well!  </p>

<h3>Albertine Press is moving to Inman Square!</h3>
<p>After twelve years in Union Square, Somerville, Albertine Press is moving. Our new location is only blocks from our current studio and in the heart of Inman Square, a historic, vibrant Cambridge neighborhood full of restaurants, shops, and a growing maker community. In addition to our letterpress studio, we will be adding a new retail store focused on the exchange of the written word, plus a space for workshops and creative events. We bring to our new neighborhood a place where creative community can grow by sharing tables, materials, and ideas with one another. Help us create our new home in Inman!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509772263/cxwts1wq3yxyn7yimxwa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div><h3>Write More. Right Now.</h3></div><div>
<p>Albertine Press is a woman-owned design and letterpress print studio founded in 2005 by Shelley Barandes, a sometime-architect who just loved paper more. Our team carries on the centuries-old tradition of letterpress printing; inks are still hand-mixed, most of our presses are hand-fed, and we have a collection of hand-set wood and metal type. We also integrate computers and photopolymer plates, marrying age-old techniques with modern technology.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509257733/tuf5lgqocvbkxapo4mu0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At its core, our artisanal business is built upon the physical, tactile exchange of the written word and communication as it once was - lasting, memorable, meaningful. In a digital world, we all have fewer and fewer instances to engage with one another in this indelible way, and we typically reserve them for momentous life occasions. Albertine Press wants to help people bring the celebration of paper and written exchange to the everyday.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509257964/thgb9hw2pokhy3ob5luo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In our new space we can do this. We will sell not only our own paper goods, but work by other respected artisans and craftspeople, as well as desk accessories, craft supplies, and paper curiosities for our local paper lovers. We're connected to a vast network of makers from which we can curate a collection not available online or at chain stores. Funds will help us with custom build out particular to selling stationery and gifts as well as commissioning unique custom products for our community.</p>
<p>Teaching has also been an integral part of the studio mission from the beginning. For our first few years, we offered regular workshops in letterpress and book arts, but as our business grew, the demands on our small space made it impossible to continue.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509579133/fhcs2eormz4tiagr5j0z.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are beyond excited to have found a new space for Albertine with the flexibility to go back to our roots and offer regular workshops and events once again. We are working hard on developing some fantastic offerings for the month of December, including calligraphy, DIY holiday gift wrap, thank-you-note writing, print-your-own stationery, and more.</p>
<p>We are also committed to supporting our community by offering up our mixed-use space regularly to neighborhood groups - helping promote open communication and conversation between neighbors.</p> <h3>What’s all the money for anyway?</h3>
<p>The money we raise will offset these major expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Moving the studio :: </strong>Moving our antique presses is no small feat; it requires specialized riggers and equipment because they literally don’t make ‘em like they used to - they no longer make presses like these at all! In addition to moving a studio with twelve-years of accumulated furniture and ephemera, the week-long process will require partially dismantling and reassembling several of our presses.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Build out :: </strong> Some of the funds raised will be used to outfit our flexible, mixed-use workshop space with large, sturdy worktables and stools (so we can host more of you at once!), to install good lighting, and to purchase additional tools and materials so we can develop a wider range of workshops. We want our new home to be welcoming, bright, and comfortable for everyone. Ikea is great and all, but we’d like to create something really special and reflective of our industrial roots. <br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>What’s in it for me? Perk up!</h3>
<p>Besides our eternal heartfelt gratitude, we’ve got a great collection of perks for those who contribute to the campaign. Scroll through the list at right for more details, but we think there’s something for everyone.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting any new venture is hard: learning new systems, overcoming challenges in financing, managing the seasonality of retail, growing a brand. Fortunately for us, we have twelve years of experience and company growth behind us. While we’ve never run a retail store, per se, we’ve built out and merchandised our products at international trade shows for over a decade; our team members have all worked at countless craft fairs and expos and engaged directly with our customers; we’ve worked with retail buyers on the flip side as a wholesaler, and connected personally with other artists and craftspeople throughout the stationery and gift industries.</p>
<p>The multi-faceted nature of our expanded business will help us balance the seasonality of all of our different services. A slow time for wedding invitations may be a busy time for the store, and vice versa. We feel as well-prepared for this adventure as anyone could be.</p>
<p>So why reach out to our friends, family, and community? We have big dreams for our space but a limited budget. The amount we’re trying to raise does not represent the entire cost of our move or expansion and we are committed to this next step regardless of the success of this campaign. However, with our community’s support, we can make Albertine Press the best it can be - something we can all share in and grow together.<br/> </p>

<h3>Spread the Word!</h3>
<p>For the past twelve years in our current studio in Union Square, Somerville, we have cranked and clanked away on our antique presses to print over 40,000 wedding invitations and announcements, and over 250,000 greeting cards, note cards, postcards, calendars, fine art prints, and other paper delights for customers and stores across the country and around the world.</p>
<p>If we’ve touched your life, if you’ve ever bought or received an Albertine Press greeting card, if we helped you celebrate life’s momentous occasions with our invitations and announcements, we hope you’ll consider supporting us again, either by contributing to our campaign or spreading the word to others. Either way, we’ll see you soon in Inman!</p>

</div></div>","Albertine Press is moving to Inman Square!
After twelve years in Union Square, Somerville, Albertine Press is moving. Our new location is only blocks from our current studio and in the heart of Inman Square, a historic, vibrant Cambridge neighborhood full of restaurants, shops, and a growing maker community. In addition to our letterpress studio, we will be adding a new retail store focused on the exchange of the written word, plus a space for workshops and creative events. We bring to our new neighborhood a place where creative community can grow by sharing tables, materials, and ideas with one another. Help us create our new home in Inman!

Write More. Right Now.
Albertine Press is a woman-owned design and letterpress print studio founded in 2005 by Shelley Barandes, a sometime-architect who just loved paper more. Our team carries on the centuries-old tradition of letterpress printing; inks are still hand-mixed, most of our presses are hand-fed, and we have a collection of hand-set wood and metal type. We also integrate computers and photopolymer plates, marrying age-old techniques with modern technology.

At its core, our artisanal business is built upon the physical, tactile exchange of the written word and communication as it once was - lasting, memorable, meaningful. In a digital world, we all have fewer and fewer instances to engage with one another in this indelible way, and we typically reserve them for momentous life occasions. Albertine Press wants to help people bring the celebration of paper and written exchange to the everyday.

In our new space we can do this. We will sell not only our own paper goods, but work by other respected artisans and craftspeople, as well as desk accessories, craft supplies, and paper curiosities for our local paper lovers. We're connected to a vast network of makers from which we can curate a collection not available online or at chain stores. Funds will help us with custom build out particular to selling stationery and gifts as well as commissioning unique custom products for our community.
Teaching has also been an integral part of the studio mission from the beginning. For our first few years, we offered regular workshops in letterpress and book arts, but as our business grew, the demands on our small space made it impossible to continue.

We are beyond excited to have found a new space for Albertine with the flexibility to go back to our roots and offer regular workshops and events once again. We are working hard on developing some fantastic offerings for the month of December, including calligraphy, DIY holiday gift wrap, thank-you-note writing, print-your-own stationery, and more.
We are also committed to supporting our community by offering up our mixed-use space regularly to neighborhood groups - helping promote open communication and conversation between neighbors. What’s all the money for anyway?
The money we raise will offset these major expenses:


Moving the studio :: Moving our antique presses is no small feat; it requires specialized riggers and equipment because they literally don’t make ‘em like they used to - they no longer make presses like these at all! In addition to moving a studio with twelve-years of accumulated furniture and ephemera, the week-long process will require partially dismantling and reassembling several of our presses. 

Build out ::  Some of the funds raised will be used to outfit our flexible, mixed-use workshop space with large, sturdy worktables and stools (so we can host more of you at once!), to install good lighting, and to purchase additional tools and materials so we can develop a wider range of workshops. We want our new home to be welcoming, bright, and comfortable for everyone. Ikea is great and all, but we’d like to create something really special and reflective of our industrial roots.  

What’s in it for me? Perk up!
Besides our eternal heartfelt gratitude, we’ve got a great collection of perks for those who contribute to the campaign. Scroll through the list at right for more details, but we think there’s something for everyone.



For the locals :: We love Inman and so do you! Grab some of our special-edition, newly-designed Inman Square postcards and prints while they last.

<li>Founder <strong>Matt Kosoy</strong> spent nearly twenty years in the tech industry designing Web sites for a variety of clients before he began baking as a hobby in 2015. Since late 2016 he has dedicated himself full-time to establishing Rosalind Bakery, and fostering growth from a nano bakery based in his house into a full-blown retail/wholesale bakery. Originally from Philadelphia, Matt loves to surf and bake bread.</li>

<h2>Kitty Dreams</h2>
<p>Hi! I'm AJ and I'm the main human behind this cat cafe project. I have 3 cats of my own and I like to think of myself as a ""totally sane cat lady."" I worked in veterinary medicine for years and now I work as a Registered Nurse at a local hospital, but I've always wondered how I could merge the two fields to help more cats while making a difference in people's lives as well. That was until about 3 years ago when I visited my first cat cafe and realized it was possible to combine cats, coffee, and community into one amazing space for all to enjoy. I'm so excited to bring this dream to St. Pete and can't wait for you to experience it, too!</p>

<p>The SKC mission is simple: contribute something special to this amazing city while saving all the cats! The thing is, I'm just a regular person with a big dream, and I know I can't do this alone. It's going to take a village to get this fully off the ground and that's why I'm asking for your help. Each and every one of you reading this right now plays a huge role in making this cat cafe a reality for St. Pete!</p>

<h3>Cat Cafe? Catfe? What??</h3>
<p>If you're new around here, you may be super excited about this ""cat cafe"" thing everyone keeps talking about, but are still secretly wondering, ""What exactly <strong><i>IS</i></strong> a cat cafe??"" No worries! It's a common question and we don't mind explaining:</p>
<p><strong><i>The Catfe is a unique cafe experience, adding the element of cats to the typical coffee house setting. Customers can enjoy locally sourced beverages and treats while relaxing in the company of adoptable cats acquired from our rescue partner, Friends of Strays Animal Shelter. The 'Cat Lounge' is a separate space within the cafe area and provides a relaxed, home-like environment where guests are able to interact with the free-roaming kitties who live there until they get adopted.</i></strong></p>

<h2>The Ultimate WHY: The Impact</h2>
<h3>For the Cats!</h3>
<p>Thousands of perfectly healthy cats and dogs are euthanized each year due to shelter overcrowding. Sunshine Kitty Catfe’s primary goal is to help ease shelter overcrowding and promote rescue animal adoption while providing a stimulating, cage-free foster home for cats to live in while awaiting adoption. Sunshine Kitty Catfe is proudly partnered with Friends of Strays Animal Shelter and through this unique platform we aim to help more homeless and abandoned cats find the loving forever homes they deserve.</p>
<p>The Catfe will provide adoptable cats the socialization and exposure to potential adopters that they may not necessarily receive in the traditional shelter setting. Customers will have the opportunity to spend as much time as they wish with the cats in a relaxing environment where they will be able to see each cat's true personality. This atmosphere will foster stronger bonds with the cats, leading to more successful adoptions, decreasing adoption returns and re-homing efforts, and reducing euthanasia rates by allowing the shelter to take in even more homeless and stray cats in our community.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>For the People!</h3>
<p>Our second goal is to be of benefit to humans, too! It is scientifically proven that spending time with cats reduces stress, decreases blood pressure, and promotes the release of endorphins in the brain that make us feel happy. It has also been shown that the frequency of the vibrations from a cat’s purr can promote healing within the body. People who already own cats, people who are not able to have cats where they live, and people looking to adopt a new cat will all benefit from the Catfe. Not only will customers have a new space for socializing and working, but it will be good for their health as well! Sunshine Kitty Catfe will be enhancing the well-being of both the cats and the community.</p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div><div>
<p>We've acquired a beautiful space in the Grand Central District of downtown St. Pete, but there's still a lot of work to be done before Sunshine Kitty can open its doors and we can cuddle all the cats. The next big steps include major renovations of the space, acquiring appropriate permitting and licensing required by the city and state, and then ""catification"" of the Cat Lounge so the kitties have the most ameowzing space to live and play in until they get adopted!</p>
<p>Your generous donations will go towards these substantial costs that we'll incur in the coming months as we approach the home stretch of opening St. Pete's first cat cafe. It's been a long time coming and you, SKC tribe, should be rewarded! That's why the backer perks were created with YOU, our community, in mind and we want the final end product that is Sunshine Kitty Catfe to reflect that.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>All backers will receive updates on our progress including permit approvals, construction happenings, perk fulfillment, sneak peek and opening dates, and more. As of right now, our anticipated grand opening date is in October!</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
</div><div>
<p><strong><u>Fundraising:</u></strong></p>
<p>Our space has so much potential and we want to make Sunshine Kitty an amazing experience for everyone, so that's why we're asking for your generous donations to help us make that happen! Since the Catfe will serve food and drinks (did we mention beer and wine??) while also housing cats, our space will require major renovations in order to meet very specific city and state building and health code regulations. Though our goal may seem like a lot at first glance, it's not because we're being extravagant, it's because this is a huge project and we need to hire professionals to do most of the renovations for us.</p>
<p>If we do not meet our fundraising goal, this would likely delay construction, which ultimately delays the grand opening of the Catfe. The key is to reach and exceed our goal so we can create the best space possible for the kitties as soon as possible!</p>
<p><strong><u>Permitting:</u></strong></p>
<p>Our renovation plans must be submitted to the city of St. Petersburg for approval before we can get started on the actual construction. Obtaining permits can sometimes take upwards of 3 months, especially since St. Pete is booming right now and there are so many projects going on in the area. Currently, our goal to open is mid-September of this year. In the meantime, we are working with an awesome, trustworthy contractor team who has already begun the process of drawing up our building plans and should have the final draft ready to submit to the city for approval soon. We also have contacts at The Greenhouse, an amazing resource for small business development in St. Petersburg, and they will help us to expedite the permitting process wherever possible.</p>
<p>The good news is that the City of St. Petersburg Zoning Department has already given us the green light for zoning approval to use our acquired space as a cafe serving beer and wine while also housing cats!</p>

<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Sometimes, despite how much you wish you could donate, you just can't and we totally understand. But, there are still ways you can help!</p>
<p>1. Share, Share, Share, Share, and Share some more!! Tell your friends, family, neighbors, co-workers, mail carrier, librarian, barista, hair stylist and anyone else you can think of about our project. Whether they're local or live on the other side of the country, every mention of our mission helps! Social media share links are at the top of this page!</p>
<p>2. Donate your time. Do you perform a service that you think could help us out as we get closer to opening? (examples include cleaning, painting, interior design, landscaping, creating custom artwork, etc) Please let us know! We mean it when we say that Sunshine Kitty Catfe is powered by community!</p>

<h3>About 3 Bug Farm</h3>
<p>At 3 Bug Farm, we grow organic produce for stores, restaurants, and farmstand patrons in our local community.  When we bought the land that would become our farm in 2013, the fields were awash with dragonflies, swallowtail butterflies, and lightning bugs.  We vowed to farm the land in such a way that these insects and their cousins would always have a healthy home here.  Over the last six years, we've built our house, our farm, and had three bugs of our own.     </p>
<h3><strong>Why a Better Farmstand?</strong></h3>
<p>When we erected our small farmstand in 2015, we expected to get a few visitors per day at best.  We didn't realize how much our neighbors would value having a nearby source of organic produce!  The traffic we've been getting at our stand has overwhelmed the driveway and parking lot that we inherited from the Christmas tree operation that used to be our farm. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We're Trying to Do</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $10,000 to help improve our farmstand.  While we've already purchased the building, we still need to run power to it, expand the driveway and parking lot, add landscaping, and finish out the interior of our washing and packing area.  When we're done, we'll have a farmstand that more people in our community can access more easily, a new sign, as well as better produce storage, cooling, and display.</p>
<h3>What We'll Give You</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first 40 people to invest $35 can get a limited edition 3 Bug Farm T-Shirt.</li>
<li>For every additional $100 you provide, you have the option of claiming $105 in 3 Bug Bucks, which you can use just like cash at our stand.  The Bucks have no expiration date. </li>
<li>If you like, you can choose to donate some or all of your investment to local food pantries.  We'll contact our local food pantries, find out what they need, and grow food that be donated in place of your 3 Bug Bucks.</li>

In the spirit of transparency, we would like to note that $28,000 is a lowball estimate of the monthly cost of the business functioning above the red and the workers who make that happen earning something like a living wage.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong> </p>
<p>We are dog lovers, dog owners and entrepreneurs at heart with a passion for working and connecting with great people.    </p>
<p>Furball Fitness has been servicing lovely humans and their dogs throughout the greater Bay Area for over 7 years now, and we're pleased to be bringing the same great mission and service to the North Loop in Minneapolis (slated to open in August 2020). </p>
<p>Minneapolis-based owners, Dani and Lindsay DiMeglio are excited to share their vision and start the next chapter of the beloved Furball Fitness story – Minnesota style.  To do so, the pair is opening up a new modern,  convenient, top-of-the-line doggie daycare facility in the heart of the North Loop, bringing together all the amenities you and your fur babies look for in a home away from home.  Rest easy while you’re at work, need a break, or just simply want to get your dog some exercise with pals.  They’ll be in good hands with us at Furball Fitness MN. </p>

<p><strong>About Furball Fitness:</strong></p>
<p>Furball Fitness Dog Camp and Daycare is a cage-free indoor dog park / daycare facility specializing in daily, supervised ""play-care"". Staff members are dedicated to maintaining a safe space for your pups to feel comfortable, socialize and have a ball! </p>
<p>One of the special things about Furball Fitness is that we are purposeful in maintaining an intimate environment. You will develop a good rapport with all of our handlers, and your dog will have that same consistency in knowing who they are hanging with on any given day. We also strive to keep the pack as consistent as possible, giving your dog the opportunity to develop lasting friendships.</p>
<p>With our large 3,000+ square foot indoor/outdoor facility in the heart of the North Loop, we're providing the flexibility, convenience and familiarity you’re looking for while offering up ample space for the dogs to play, observe, rest, and whatever else they like to do.  To preserve this relaxed environment and to maintain a good dog-to-human ratio, we will assign small groups of dogs to each handler per session.  Finally, because you will know each and every one of your dog’s caretakers personally, this private format helps to build a reliable, communicative, and intimate relationship and experience that is so important to us. </p>
<p>Your dog will exercise, socialize, and become well-adjusted creatures of the community!  Our hands-on staff will also work and play with your pup 1-on-1 throughout the day to keep him or her engaged and comfortable within the pack environment.  </p>
<p>Furball Fitness MN will also feature seasonal pet-related goods and services for the convenience of our customers, with a focus on locally sourced products hand-picked by our staff.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise a minimum $15,000 to help us create a first-class facility with first-class staff for you and your pet to feel at ease every day all day. With the money we raise on Indiegogo, we will able to add and improve our existing and future services with the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Dog Lounge and Play Equipment – We want the best blocks and ramps for your dogs to play on while giving those that love to nap, a cozy space to do so.  Plus they’ll love all the pets from our staff on the cozy couches during rest time.</li>
<li>Outdoor dog play space and lounge area</li>
<li>Easy payment and booking system with an online portal for all of your customer needs. This would also allow us to take and share pictures throughout the day and add them to your pups report card. Plus a one-stop-shop for making reservations, tracking your payments and packages, add or modify vaccination records and make/view notes related to the care of your buddy.</li>
<li>Special agility flooring to help keep their joints and bodies happy and healthy!  Explain how much funding you need and where it's going.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other upgrades we’re considering include; </strong></p>

<li>
<strong>Hands-On Attention &amp; Training</strong> – preserve consistency in your home training by utilizing pre-established commands; in addition, fine-tune manners and other skills, like off-leash recall.</li>
<li>
<strong>Small Play Groups, Large Play Area(s)</strong> – safety and comfort in keeping a maximum capacity; no more than 20 dogs per staff member. Just the right amount of dogs. Just the right amount of energy. Just the right amount of space with plenty of room to roam. We’re not trying to build a doggie empire over here with hundreds of dogs circling through each day. Furball Fitness MN is deliberate in staying intimate with the goal of servicing each and every one of you to the best of our ability. </li>
<li>
<strong>Lasting Friendships and Enhanced Socialization Skills</strong> – experienced staff who develop a personal relationship with you and your dog. No revolving door of walkers. We’ll build trust. You’ll know your dog’s caretaker well.</li>
<li>
<strong>No Crates</strong> – because we cap group sizes and have plenty of space, no crates are utilized. The puppies treat the indoor dog park as their own backyard – run around and rumble OR sprawl out and lounge.  Totally cage-free!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The goal of Furball Fitness today is to provide an integral service and experience for the communities in which we are located, one that is paramount to everyday life. </p>
<p>With your help, we hope to fulfill this mission alongside our close friend and founding member, Sheri Villa, by opening this new stellar location in the North Loop of Minneapolis – building a community around our common love of dogs! </p>

<h3>What's Happening?</h3>
<p>We're a truly classic drive-in theatre that has been bringing you movies under the stars for 66 years.  Who doesn't love a double or triple-feature with family and friends?  You've told us that you'd love to come more often.  Since movies require a two week minimum run, we need a second screen to make that happen.</p>
<p>We've been working on this project for a couple seasons now.  Most of the infrastructure is in place, but some unexpected issues (think plumbing, electrical and structural) with the original 1953 building has taken most of the budget we had in place.</p>
<p>With two screens, we'll be able to offer a more balanced mix in terms of ""family"" and ""mature"" films, and open new ones almost every week.  More Screens, More Movies, More Drive-In Nights!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>You Can Help!</h3>
<p>Some of our great fans have generously suggested crowdfunding as a way to reach this expansion goal quicker.  We love our role as caretakers of this historic institution.  Our mandate is to preserve a classic experience and feel while maintaining relevance and viability for generations to come.</p>
<p>Your contribution will enable us to finish our Screen 2 expansion and get you enjoying more drive-in nights much sooner.  We've allocated a large portion of the proceeds from the past few seasons to this project and most of the infrastructure we need is complete.  </p>
<p>We know we'll get there eventually, but just a little extra push now and we're good to go!  At this point, we need to build a screen, buy another projector and do some earthwork.  Besides engineering the screen, nothing requires approval, so if we can fund it, we can do it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Are We Asking For Help?</h3>
<p>Our customers are the reason we love what we do.  Many voices these days would have you believe nothing's like it used to be, the world is colder, busier, it doesn't know how to slow down.  That's certainly not what we see here.  We see people making new lifelong friends as they chat before showtime.  We see smiling happy people enjoying the simple pleasure of movies under a perfect sky.  We hear crickets and laughter.  The combination is nothing short of tonic for the modern soul!  We get to enjoy this every night and we think you'll see the value in being able to enjoy it more often.</p>

Lion's Tooth is a start-up bookstore café specializing in small press books and graphic novels. We started this Indiegogo campaign before the coronavirus crisis hit, but we're not giving up our dream to have a storefront in Milwaukee.

Our goal is to offer high-quality comics and books for kids and adults, and to provide Milwaukee with a unique cultural hub and gathering place.
We've been holding pop-ups since the fall of 2019 and recently launched our book and graphic novel subscription service, which we are now promoting with this campaign :)

What we want: a home in Milwaukee
The funds raised through our subscriptions will help finance our brick-and-mortar location. We need your support as we take the huge step of opening our storefront.
We are planning a bookstore café with a busy event calendar including story time, book clubs, art exhibits and music shows. Lion's Tooth will be a magical space for people of all ages. We want to become your favorite place!

What you get: amazing care packages 

All our crowdfunding efforts are based on our subscription program. Every month we curate a selection of books and comics, and feature artists who create zines and treats specially for our care packages.
Getting a subscription is the best way to support our vision because:

It puts us in the business of offering awesome books and graphic novels
It allows us to support artists by commissioning and featuring their amazing work
It builds community through our book clubs


Here's what you get with each care package:

A new release (book or graphic novel)
Something fun from a featured artist (like a zine or a print)
Lion's Tooth mini zine with information about what is in the package

The ladies behind Lion's Tooth
Lion's Tooth is a partnership between Shelly McClone-Carriere and Cris Siqueira.


Shelly McClone-Carriere is one of the founders of the Riverwest Co-op. She was a board member from 2002-2012, manager from 2001-2018 and bookkeeper since 2003. She is currently the School Café coordinator at Highland Community School, working with middle schoolers to develop skills that include planning the menu, budgeting and preparing meals for students, teachers and family members. Shelly's passion for books and community is at the heart of what Lion's Tooth stands for.

Cris Siqueira is a Brazilian-born American citizen living in Milwaukee since 2004. She owned a bookstore  specialized in ""comics as art"" in São Paulo, and has translated over ten graphic novels to Portuguese. In 1997, Cris interviewed some of the most important American cartoonists, like the Hernandez brothers, Daniel Clowes, Chris Ware and Dame Darcy, and published an award-winning compilation that introduced their work to Brazilian readers. For the last couple of years she has been revisiting her favorite artists, and these conversations are being published in the Milwaukee Record and in Lion's Tooth website.

I've always been interested in how everything works and everything technology related, so I started working with computers as soon as I could when I needed a Saturday job. After working in IT with some big enterprises and absorbing every bit of knowledge possible, 15 years later I now run my own IT business.  


I gave up a fulltime job and started echo77 in 2013 to provide simple, sensible technical support to other small business locally around me so that they could focus on their busineses without having to be an IT guru at the same time.  My small startup is doing well, and I re-invest everything into improving the systems and services we can offer.

My goal has always been to keep my own costs as low as possible so that I can pass on the cost saving to our clients.  With the help of eBay and every bargain I can find, I have built a small datacentre to help us provide great private cloud services, email and website hosting to local small business. We also provide IT support to home users and repair laptops and PCs.

Anchor & Bliss Oil
Moisturiser is a high-quality, all natural product which is great for
all skin (inked and un-inked alike) and also ticks all the environmental and ethical boxes! It contains no alcohol, no parabens
(preservatives), no colours, it's vegan, 100% natural and it isn't tested on animals (because animals
are awesome and we love them).The ingredients work to soothe and smooth skin, and with ongoing use you'll find that your skin is better than ever. You won't look like a greased up body-builder, but people will definitely ask you what you're using to make your skin glow (and your tattoos pop)!There's 3 parts to the range:

Bare
Bones – an unscented version for those with extra sensitive skin


Mother’s
Ruin – a fresh scent containing eucalyptus and mint (yes, it works)


Fleet St
Barbershop – evokes an old fashioned shave with juniper berry and sweet
orange.


It's a product that lots of people will love if they get a
chance to try it. 
What you get
We've got some pretty great perks to help sweeten the pot. There are cool stickers
for your car/guitar/bike/walls, discounts for our web store, tote bags, limited edition (WRAP certified) campaign
t-shirts as well as the opportunity to join our High Rollers Club for exclusive
deals, sneak peeks and the possibility of being a tester for any new
products we develop. That’s the sort of experience that money can’t buy (except
that in this case it totally can!!!). And of course you can get your own bottle
of Anchor & Bliss oil moisturiser (or more than one!). Your skin and your tattoos will
thank you. What we need and where the money will goWe’re keeping our initial goal low - $7500 will cover about half of our first production run and if we have to pony up the rest then we will, because we believe in putting our money where our mouth is.We'll fulfil the perks and the rest will go into manufacturing and product insurance (which we have to have).

The impact
It is important for Anchor & Bliss to be part of a movement that equalises men and women rather than playing them off against each other for the most profit – your contribution can be your way of saying that you believe things can be done better.Let’s face it, tattooing and alternative culture can be a bit

Meet Anchor & Bliss
Hi we’re Anchor &
Bliss, although in our everyday lives we just go by Andy and Bec. 

Andy is a web designer
who’s currently also studying graphic design. Punk rock got him interested in politics, gender issues and DIY. He has duct-taped many things back together. He's run small businesses in the past so knows how important it is to keep an eye on the details.
Bec is a creative writing
major with a flair for self-expression, both in her writing and in her
personal style. She's passionate about finding ways to address inequality and make positive changes in the world. Bec has worked in admin for multi-million dollar agencies and coordinated communications campaigns for NGOs. 
Together we like to walk our
dog, drink craft beer and cook tasty food. We're generally happiest with a
project and both dream of the day when we no longer have to answer to ‘the
man’.  We would both like more tattoos.
That’s why we started Anchor & Bliss - the idea that we needed a really great product for our skin and our ink. We've been working on this idea for nearly a year now – testing and refining our product, building our website, getting on
with social media and looking into ethical and environmentally friendly ways to
run our business.
What this means to us
Anchor & Bliss is an
opportunity for us to build a business from the ground up, the way a business should be built. We want to prove that you can make high quality products that don't exploit people, animals or the environment and at the same time keep those products available at a reasonable price.

commissioners this coming November.  Like you, I care about where I live and I 
would like to play an integral part in helping our community grow stronger and 
brighter for all residents of today and tomorrow.  Below, I would like to 
address a few issues that I would fiercely attempt to accomplish with the 
support of the township residents.
</h3>
<p> <strong><u>FIRST:  </u></strong>I propose we put aside a percentage of 
the income we receive from the casino to start a ""Rainy Day Fund.""  The current 
board of commissioners bought new DPW equipment, trucks, police cars and other 
items that the township needed.  But in turn, cost the township a significant 
amount of dollars.  We as a township receive a formidable amount of dollars each 
year from the casino.  I would like to put those dollars toward projects that 
may prove to be beneficial to residents.  The township made ends meet before the 
casino.  The extra cash flow should be used to improve our community, make it 
safer and a more desirable place to live.</p>
<p> <strong><u>Second:</u></strong>  I propose we revise and potentially 
change out recycling program.  Right now, Plains offers curb side pickup only 
once a month.  Or, we can drop off recycling at the DPW, yet this is 
inconvenient for many of us.  As such, even Saturday hours are difficult to make 
when we lead such hectic lives.  Many households try to recycle as much as 
possible.  But we find some months we don't have enough space to store all of 
the recyclables.  I would like to convert to two recycling pickups a month 
(every other week), and switch to single stream recycling.  This would allow 
residents to put everything in one container and have it picked all at the same 
time.  This plan has the potential to save the Township money relative to 
manpower hours and fule making our recycling greener simultaneously.  Also, the more recycling the township takes in and takes to get recycled.  The more money it brings in.</p>
<p> <strong><u>Third:  </u></strong>I want to spruce up our neighborhoods 
throughout the Township, by giving our roads more attention and potentially 
adding sidewalks where that improvement is needed.  Along with other measures, 
the ""Rainy Day Fund"" would play a key roll in financing these and other long and 
short term projects.</p>
<p> I would like to thank you very much for your time.  I thank you in 
advance for your support in this upcoming election day.  Without your vote I 
can't proceed to make proposals related to making changes for the better.</p>
<p> Help make these ideas a reality and help take back the Township from 
one party rule!!!  Financial support is greatly appreciated as your budget 
allows!!  Every dime will be invested to achieve short, intermediate and long 
term goals.  I kindly request your support to begin to enact positive changes.  
Support can be mailed to:</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you around town, chat with me Talk.<u>Engage to 
change</u>!  Let me know your thoughts.</p>

As you know by now, last week we had our new van and all our new tools stolen. Hopefully the van insurance will be enough to buy a new van but the tools were not yet insured - it is costing £3500 to replace them, and I doubt the insurance company will give us what we paid for the van. We will also be buying insurance for the new tools, and a top-of-the-range steeringwheel lock for the replacement van! 
What We Need & What You Get


 
We think the theft will leave us about £5k down, nearly all the company profits for the year so far.
 Friends and family have suggested we do this crowd-funder to help ease the blow a little. Help right a wrong!

Whatever you can give will be much appreciated. (there is a PayPal option) The many kind people can outdo the few evil people who stole our van.

    The Impact  It was very painful to have the fruit of our hard work and graft taken from us. In the game of snakes and ladders that is life, we hit a long snake - and someone literaly stole our ladders.
 We were just getting ahead, we had invested all our profits into the equipment we need to forge a prosperous future, and it was all taken away in one foul swoop.
Friends and family have been super supportive, offering loans of tools and vans (Skippy, Nick, thanks guys!), and giving moral support at what was already a dificult time for me emotionally. Some cash too sure whould help ease the pain and help us build a bright future.
 No matter what we will pick oursevlves up and soldier on, but a little help would be great!
(We are very hard workers...)

    Our new tools will be insured and marked with our company name, they will have SmartWater tags to make re-selling harder and recovery easier.
   Other Ways You Can Help I know there are more deserving and needy causes than ours, but we are a good bunch just trying to do our best and we've had a big set-back, if you want to help a little that's wonderful.

<p><b>Two, as with all renovation and expansion projects, things never go exactly according to plan.</b></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>The initial contractors underestimated the project and a great deal of their work was less than satisfactory. <b>However, the single biggest issue that we face is the truss system of the new production area.</b></p>
<p>The building is quite old  but well built and framed.

<br/>
<p><b>This is a massive undertaking, requiring the re-working of more than thirty trusses in a 2800 square foot building that cannot stop operating.</b></p>
<p>We have a complete plan in place after working with structural engineers and new contractors to bring everything up to safe standards in a short period of time without disrupting the flow of work at the Meadery.</p>
<p>We just need your help to implement the plan. The lengthened time-frame has bled the remainder of the construction budget and hampered business for the past eight months.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>The Plan</h1>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we are funded, the money will go to two specific areas.</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Paying to repair the truss system of the new production space.</b><br/>
</li>
<li><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Working capital for new tanks, ingredients to fill them and the finishing touches on the 'Mead Pub' concept.</b></li>
</ol>
<p>In order to repair the trusses without disrupting the operations of the Meadery, a hole will be cut into the rear, gable-end of the attic to bring in new timber. The existing trusses will be either cut out or repaired depending on their condition. Each truss will then be bolstered by either sistering, adding new collar-ties or both. The attic will be then resealed and new insulation blown in. This will leave the downstairs production area untouched and free of debris.<br/><br/>If we are funded the full amount and the truss repair cost stays within the range we expect, we will also use a portion of the money to <b>put in a draught system so we can serve local beer at the Pub (Aw Yeah!). </b>We will also be purchasing some additional kitchen equipment to increase the variety of food we can serve. </p>
<p>Any remaining money will be used to purchase new tanks and the honey, berries, maple syrup and other ingredients to fill them. We have endless crazy ideas for new meads we think you will love. </p>
<p>We do have additional funds available to us from both the Mt. Washington Valley Economic Council and the Wentworth Economic Development Corporation, who funded the project initially. In the event that something goes awry with the repair or we do not raise sufficient funds from this campaign, we will be able to at least make the minimum repairs to ensure the building is safe and sound.</p>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Seeing Center Ossipee grow as we have grown has been one of our great pleasures. </b></span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">There are new businesses popping up in town and there seems to be a palpable energy to the community. </span>

<div>Though we certainly do not take credit for all that has happened, we do believe we have a part in it. <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Taking these next steps with the Meadery will give us and Center Ossipee more visibility. With the Mead Pub we will have another community space for events, music, presentations, lectures as well as simply gathering with friends for a drink or some food.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In a time where everyone is getting more and more busy and feeling less connected, it's more important to have places to gather, learn, talk and relax. Here's to hoping our contribution to the Center Ossipee community provides a little slice of that for ya'll.</div>

Okay folks, here's the deal. We started a huge renovation project in December of 2014 to take over a building next door, connect it to ours and completely overhaul the whole place. In the process we would add both more room for fermenting but also converting our tasting room into a Mead Pub with food, drink etc.

We worked with local community loan organizations to borrow money to make the project happen and hired a local contractor to do the work. Unfortunately we realized, late in the project, that the builder was trying to take us for a ride. The work was shoddy and the accounting was questionable. After a lot of battling, the situation became clear, We had to fire the contractors.


The biggest issue is the truss system of the new building. The rehab work they did to the framing actually rendered the trusses completely useless. After an engineer's analysis it was determined that the trusses needed to be replaced before snowfall.


So now we had a half finished project, no contractors and the truss work that had been done and paid for had to be redone.

We did what we had to, put our heads down and got to work. We had to do the rest of the renovation work ourselves. We're coming out on the other side now, a good four months later than anticipated. We still need to rework the trusses but our budget from the load has been depleted. We are asking for your help to finish off our new space. 


Who, What, Where and Why?We started Sap House Meadery in 2009 on a few basic principles. We wanted to:

Source as much of our ingredients locally as we could.


Carve out a niche and prove that mead could be much more than a novelty. 


Most importantly, however, we wanted to revitalize our hometown of Center Ossipee. 



We started by renovating an old storefront in the village of Center Ossipee using reclaimed materials. Once we had their building and licensing, we developed networks of relationships with local and regional farmers and began producing.  
The process of making mead is not a quick one and the first batches were not ready for six months. We officially opened to the public on February 11th of 2011. We then promptly sold out of our supply, which was meant to last the year, in eight weeks. 
We have grown every year since and have not looked back.

Sap House Meadery is now distributed across New Hampshire and into seven states and thousands of people visit the tasting room every year. 
One of our proudest accomplishments and most enjoyable tasks is getting a visitor to the area to come to the Meadery, discover Center Ossipee and give them tips and recommendations on what to do and see next. 
A synergy has formed between the Meadery, and other small businesses in the renaissance that is taking place in the Village; namely Mountainview Station, Lillybugs and Mountain Girl Bakery. We bounce customers between the businesses who see the town, enjoy the park, the farmers market and concerts at the Town Hall.
This campaign is the finishing touch on a renovation project that will see Sap House Meadery's capacity to be a catalyst for revitalization in Center Ossipee increase by an order of magnitude. 
The increase in production space is a small part of the vision for the community space that we envision.




The Nitty Gritty... What We Need and Why.
We launched this campaign for two reasons: 
One, we have huge dreams and visions for Sap House and Center Ossipee as a community. 
Two, as with all renovation and expansion projects, things never go exactly according to plan.

Our renovation project that began in December of 2014 has seen our Meadery increase in size four-fold, add a new tasting room and the addition of an experimental Mead Pub with food, beer, wine, mead-cocktails and all kinds of other cool stuff.
It has also seen it's timeframe more than double and the initial contractors be dismissed in March for quality of work. Ash and his father have completed the remainder of the renovations themselves.



The initial contractors underestimated the project and a great deal of their work was less than satisfactory. However, the single biggest issue that we face is the truss system of the new production area.

After an engineer examined them, the situation became clear -- Completely rework the truss system before snow-fall or risk losing the building.



This is a massive undertaking, requiring the re-working of more than thirty trusses in a 2800 square foot building that cannot stop operating.
We have a complete plan in place after working with structural engineers and new contractors to bring everything up to safe standards in a short period of time without disrupting the flow of work at the Meadery.
We just need your help to implement the plan. The lengthened time-frame has bled the remainder of the construction budget and hampered business for the past eight months.

The Plan

If we are funded, the money will go to two specific areas.



Paying to repair the truss system of the new production space.

Working capital for new tanks, ingredients to fill them and the finishing touches on the 'Mead Pub' concept.

In order to repair the trusses without disrupting the operations of the Meadery, a hole will be cut into the rear, gable-end of the attic to bring in new timber. The existing trusses will be either cut out or repaired depending on their condition. Each truss will then be bolstered by either sistering, adding new collar-ties or both. The attic will be then resealed and new insulation blown in. This will leave the downstairs production area untouched and free of debris.If we are funded the full amount and the truss repair cost stays within the range we expect, we will also use a portion of the money to put in a draught system so we can serve local beer at the Pub (Aw Yeah!). We will also be purchasing some additional kitchen equipment to increase the variety of food we can serve. 
Any remaining money will be used to purchase new tanks and the honey, berries, maple syrup and other ingredients to fill them. We have endless crazy ideas for new meads we think you will love. 
We do have additional funds available to us from both the Mt. Washington Valley Economic Council and the Wentworth Economic Development Corporation, who funded the project initially. In the event that something goes awry with the repair or we do not raise sufficient funds from this campaign, we will be able to at least make the minimum repairs to ensure the building is safe and sound.


The Impact of Sap House Meadery


Seeing Center Ossipee grow as we have grown has been one of our great pleasures. There are new businesses popping up in town and there seems to be a palpable energy to the community. 



Since we started the Mountainview Station has re-opened and has become very successful. 


The Mountain Girl Bakery has taken over both the old PB&J's location and local's waistlines. 


Lillybugs now occupies the newly renovated Iron Kettle space and is keeping Ash and I well fed with omelettes and bacon. 



The topic of conversation in town has shifted from ""What's wrong with town?"" to ""What can be done for a new business in this building or that building.?""


Though we certainly do not take credit for all that has happened, we do believe we have a part in it. 


Taking these next steps with the Meadery will give us and Center Ossipee more visibility. With the Mead Pub we will have another community space for events, music, presentations, lectures as well as simply gathering with friends for a drink or some food.

In a time where everyone is getting more and more busy and feeling less connected, it's more important to have places to gather, learn, talk and relax. Here's to hoping our contribution to the Center Ossipee community provides a little slice of that for ya'll.

<p>You've no doubt heard of the Boomerang, well this is the THONGARANG!</p>
<p>The added benefits of this Aussie high tech modern innovation is that you can wear these ultimate statements of high fashion and good taste, and then very quickly transform your footwear into a flying machine.</p>
<p>We are a couple of aged students, who in their dotty vintage, may be suffering a little post traumatic stress from excessive examinations.</p>
<p>However, we are thrilled, and have great joy at sharing the peak, the summit, ney, the world's best technological innovation with you.</p>
<p>If our funding goal is reached, we don't plan on anything too altruistic, but may drink some beer or three, and may get some stress relieving acupuncture. </p>
<p>If we vastly exceed our target, we will fly into Dallas, suitcases filled with Thongarangs, and post them from there! (We would love to go to one of your baseball ball shooting thingamajig machines, and knock the covers off a few 100mph balls.)</p>
<p>With each purchase of a Thongarang, we provide you with the appropriate specially designed screws (in clockwise) and detailed throwing instructions (in pictures too, for those more challenged by writing).</p>
<p>A few notes for you to consider, when torn between these three great Thongarang choices.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>THE BIG DAZZA : takes a stronger arm to throw, and in flight sounds like a Chinook - about as slow too! What it lacks in speed, it makes up in the thud on the receiving end!</h4>

<br/>
</div>
<h4>THE SHAZZA : looks more petite, but make no mistake, in flight she screams like a raving banshee, with mega velocity. Your catching skills will be severely tested!</h4>

<h4>RISKS AND CHALLENGES:</h4>
<p>May not return when thrown due to dodgy technique.</p>
<p>May be worn for long time, however excessive accumulated dirt may alter optimal flight characteristics.</p>
<p>May cause hysterical laughter - see your physician if this continues for a prolonged period of time.</p>

</div></div>","THE THONGARANG! In Australia (not Austria) Flip Flops are called Thongs.
You've no doubt heard of the Boomerang, well this is the THONGARANG!
The added benefits of this Aussie high tech modern innovation is that you can wear these ultimate statements of high fashion and good taste, and then very quickly transform your footwear into a flying machine.
We are a couple of aged students, who in their dotty vintage, may be suffering a little post traumatic stress from excessive examinations.
However, we are thrilled, and have great joy at sharing the peak, the summit, ney, the world's best technological innovation with you.
If our funding goal is reached, we don't plan on anything too altruistic, but may drink some beer or three, and may get some stress relieving acupuncture. 
If we vastly exceed our target, we will fly into Dallas, suitcases filled with Thongarangs, and post them from there! (We would love to go to one of your baseball ball shooting thingamajig machines, and knock the covers off a few 100mph balls.)
With each purchase of a Thongarang, we provide you with the appropriate specially designed screws (in clockwise) and detailed throwing instructions (in pictures too, for those more challenged by writing).
A few notes for you to consider, when torn between these three great Thongarang choices.

THE BIG DAZZA : takes a stronger arm to throw, and in flight sounds like a Chinook - about as slow too! What it lacks in speed, it makes up in the thud on the receiving end!




THE SHAZZA : looks more petite, but make no mistake, in flight she screams like a raving banshee, with mega velocity. Your catching skills will be severely tested!





THE LITTLE TAKKA : almost silent in flight, very very quick, but stings like a diminutive bee. Very hard to catch!



The THONGARANG in all its glory!!


RISKS AND CHALLENGES:
May not return when thrown due to dodgy technique.
May be worn for long time, however excessive accumulated dirt may alter optimal flight characteristics.
May cause hysterical laughter - see your physician if this continues for a prolonged period of time.
May be hung over fireplace or door, as a message!",3.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Welcome to our crowdfunding page! We are Thomas,
Lars and PieterJan aka TLP. A few months ago we somehow came to the ridiculous
decision to embark on a journey towards Mongolia in a car fit to do Sunday's
groceries at best: The legendary Opel Agila. 12000 kilometers of hot deserts,
dusty steppes and rough roads are on the menu starting from the London Goodwood
Track all the way to Ulan Bataar. They say the journey is more important
than the destination... We might have taken that expression a tiny bit too literal.<br/><br/>But WHY? We hear you ask</p>
<p>First off, we would like to give something back to our planet and the community. We're supporting <b>2 very solid charities</b> in the course of our adventure and really hope to get enough funding to make a REAL difference!</p>
<p>Secondly we're not the kind of people that like to spend our holidays lying around a hotel pool marinating in our own laziness. No, we'd rather go out there, get our hands dirty and come back with an incredible story! </p>

THE CARAfter weeks of searching for a decent second hand car we came across the absolute worst choice of the bunch: The Opel Agila. It's the perfect car for when you're 65 and still like to go by the library from time to time. 





This beauty will need to be fully equiped with offroad suspension to make up for the ridiculously small tires, a roof rack to store the spare parts we'll inevitably need and many, many spare tires. AIRCO is for sissies and CASETTES are totally back! Seriously, if you have some old casettes, we're taking.



THE UN-ROUTE


We decided to take the Southern Route, driving through Eastern Europe into Turkey hoping to bribe our way through to Iran. Of course we have a back-up plan if this fails, that goes through Armenia and Azerbeidjan taking the ferry to Turkmenistan. Then, without much further foreseeable problems we merrily drive through Uzbekistan and Kazachstan both known for it's hospitable countrymen and welcoming cities. Or was it dictatorship? After that we do a quick border check with Russia, staying in this really cosy shack Lars booked:To finally arrive in Mongolia after 5 weeks of getting acquainted with each other's body smell and playing the same mix tape casette over and over again
Here's a small overview of the scheduled timing of our trip:
We sincerely hope that, reading through all this nonesense, you do understand how we will first focus on delivering a REAL contribution to our charities before we focus on softening the financial blow for ourselves. Though the outset of our journey may seem somewhat ridiculous, the cause is most definitely a noble one.",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div><p><b>Who We Are</b></p>
<p>We are the
Connollys – Mike, Natalie, Bridget, Austin, Brian &amp; Liam—a tight-knit
Irish-American family with a strong sense of heritage and a work-ethic to match.  With our love for life and a collective sense
of humor that will keep you on your toes, we are dedicated to the family unit
and we hope to embody the traditions of Ireland and the versatility of our rich
American culture into Connolly’s Public House.</p>
<p><b>Our Vision</b></p>
<p>We are in the
final stages of launching a genuine, fun, family-owned Irish Pub that combines
two elements we feel strongly about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Embracing the classic traditions and cultural
     elements found in Irish pubs both in America
     and in Ireland; and</li>
<li>Catering to a vibrant, dynamic American market
     with a menu that brings Irish food into the new millennium—a careful blend
     of feeling good and eating well.</li>
</ol>
<p>As part of
feeling good, Connolly’s will offer the congenial atmosphere of a true Public House
- an extension of the proprietor’s living room. It will be a place where the neighborhood
can congregate, celebrate and enjoy good company and great “craic"" (<span>an Irish term for fun,
entertainment, and enjoyable conversation). Everybody needs a place to just
chill and socialize – and if your definition of socialize means stopping in for
a beer and free WiFi to check Facebook, that’s fine too!</span></p>
<p>We anticipate families and patrons of all ages will visit
and be comfortable enjoying a meal, a drink, and the camaraderie of a
neighborhood gathering place. Our belief is that the lively culture of the
Irish extends to all through an eclectic selection of music, dancing,
story-telling, and celebration. Join us for a game of pool or darts, a
televised sporting event, world news on the TV, or maybe an evening of karaoke.
The fun just never ends with the Connollys!</p>
<p>Since we want to feed and nourish the community with quality
dishes, our belief is that Irish food can be both traditional <u>and</u>
flavorful, if not a bit whimsical. Choices will include standard Irish Pub
fare, family-dinner specials, and dishes that appeal to the more adventurous. The
menu will allow for fresh, healthy choices and accommodate dietary needs with  <b><i>gluten free</i></b>,
<i><b>vegetarian</b></i>, and <b><i>lower fat options</i></b>. We believe that Irish Pub food doesn’t need
to be boring and that a menu can be done well without approaching the “fine
dining” end of the price spectrum. Most menu items will fall in the $8-18 range.
We anticipate the use of local suppliers and farm-to-table food sources when
available.  This will allow us to support local farming, reduce packaging, lower transportation costs, and the ability to compost a large
portion of our garbage thus helping to reduce our carbon footprint.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>This campaign
will be the final push we need to complete our concept and continue renovating the
space.  We are in the home stretch and your essential contribution will
help this concept become a reality. The anticipated total cost of our project is almost $100,000 and this campaign represents the final $30,000 needed.</p>
<p>Your
contributions will help us convert a tired, 20-year old restaurant into Connolly’s
Public House. We will create a classic pub façade, construct and equip a
comfortable and welcoming bar area (including a 12-tap beer system), modernize
the older kitchen and equipment, and provide for traffic flow enhancements throughout
the space (including ADA accessibility). The 4,500 square foot location is
directly across the street from the Metra and CTA Harlem Green Line train
stations in Oak Park, IL and enjoys a plethora of foot traffic.  The Carleton Hotel is around the corner, and many other restaurants and shops make up this exciting area. Approximately 800 new housing units will be
joining this immediate neighborhood over the next three years.  We’d like all of them to call Connolly’s
home!</p>
<p>Any and all
contributions are greatly appreciated. We have some wonderful perks to help
guide you in deciding how much to contribute. </p>
<p>To the extent we
exceed our funding goal, we will earmark those funds to eventually lease the 2<sup>nd</sup>
floor space as a banquet facility. In addition, our long-term goal is to
purchase the building as we have an option to do so in our lease.</p>
<p><b>What
Impact Will Your Contributions Make?</b></p>
<p>On a micro level, your contribution will allow us to
open our doors, promote a sense of family, and give back to a community that
has given us tremendous support over the years. We raised our children and made
our home in Oak Park, cultivated a number of good friends, and cherish many fond memories. We want to bring
that community (and you) into our family – an adoption of sorts – by proudly
serving them our food and spirits in a warm, inviting setting with a family
feel. Your contribution will also help bring jobs to the area and support other local entrepreneurs and businesses from the day we open and while we grow and thrive. </p>
<p>Your contribution will make an impact on
a macro level as well. Like many others, our family has been hit hard by the recent
Recession. After many years of dedication to the success of corporate America, Natalie
and Mike find themselves with little reward and much less hair - Mike that is!  As our kids begin to graduate college and
enter the work-force, they are feeling a disconnection to the world of big
business and are more attracted to entrepreneurial life as well. The collective feeling
among us is that the world is best served by the efforts of small businesses
and individuals who put their heart and soul into making their mark. Your
contribution will help us get back to basics and go to bat for small business
and family farms. We plan to be a beacon of support for these causes and
ultimately pay it forward by earmarking some of our profits to help fund other IndieGoGo campaigns.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>We have been around the block enough to know that nothing in
life or in business is without risk. While the construction required in this
space is minimal, there still exists the risk of cost or time overruns. In
addition, our revenue targets may take longer to achieve than expected. We have
accounted for these contingencies in our start-up budget. </p>
<p>With more than 40 years of combined business, finance, and
operations experience, we feel equipped to face the challenges ahead.  And like all good business persons, we know when
to enlist the expertise of others.  We
have assembled a team of family, friends, and business associates to give us guidance and we will
hire experienced hospitality professionals to help meet the day to day demands
of the Pub.</p>
<p>We also feel strongly in the flexibility of being a family
owned and operated business. This allows us to contribute extreme amounts of sweat
equity directly to the business while remaining together as we do so.</p>
<p><b>How Else Can You Help?</b></p>
<p>Regardless of
your level of assistance, we also ask for your support by forwarding our cause
to your friends and family via email, word of mouth, and social media. And by “family
and friends”, we mean, <b>EVERYBODY</b>…your mail carrier…your dentist…your dry
cleaner…everybody! It takes a village. Thanks for your support!</p>

<p>In December of 2014, I, Daniel ( guy on the right in top picture), craved an
authentic, Colombian, home-cooked meal. I wanted something fresh; something
that felt like home. But that meant that I would have to try to cook, and like
many people, I just didn’t have time. My partner-in-crime and co-founder, Kevin
(guy on left of top photo), would always come to work with containers filled
with Ecuadorian food that his mother had cooked. That was the kind of food I
wanted! I asked Kevin’s mother if she could make an extra serving for me that I
could pay her for. Then it hit us! </p>

How many people out there love to cook and would
benefit from selling their awesome food?! How awesome would it be if there was
an online marketplace where you can see what your neighbors are cooking, order
it if it looks good, and have it delivered to your doorstep?! With these ideas,
Localtarian was born.<p></p><p>We are on a mission to strengthen community ties, one home-cooked meal at a time and we are excited to have you be part of the journey.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/987/765/b0fbfee4faa7fac52a01633992f38d20_original.jpg?v=1434408512&amp;w=456&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=b4183df424b78589529067eecea2ff0d"" src="""" style=""width: 387.45945945946px; height: 512px;""/></p><h1>      What We Have Been Up To</h1><p>We launched our pilot for 7 weeks  in West Harlem with paper menus and 3 cooks.

an online marketplace where you can see what your neighbors are cooking, order
it if it looks good, and have it delivered to your doorstep?! With these ideas,
Localtarian was born.We are on a mission to strengthen community ties, one home-cooked meal at a time and we are excited to have you be part of the journey.       What We Have Been Up ToWe launched our pilot for 7 weeks  in West Harlem with paper menus and 3 cooks. We have sold over 250 plates of food! We've also teamed up a delivery company called  Baagd who will be doing our future deliveries. We have also been spreading the word all over New York City about what Localtarian is up to and we've been getting great feedback!                                       What We Will Do With Your SupportWe plan on expanding to every neighborhood in NYC. But to expand to other neighborhoods we need some dinero. We need to buy thousands of supplies such as food containers, utensils, and cups for our cooks. Also expanding  to new neighborhoods also means cost of delivery will increase.Areas we will expand to by October include:Central HarlemUpper West SideEast HarlemProspect ParkAstoriaWashington HeightsFlushingWilliamsburgBushwickand many more!The neighborhood we get the most support from will be the next area we expand to.                        Meet Some of the Awesome Cooks",5.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Summary: 
The people at St. John UCC, a small church with a big
heart, want to feed young stomachs so hungry minds can grow.
It is a shame that in a time of such abundance and plenty, nearly
half of the school children in our community come from families living at or
below the poverty line.  We all know, when your tummy is empty, it’s hard
to focus on learning.
Why the weekend? Most of these kids have subsidized meals
at school during the week. Often though, they come home to find empty cupboards
and emptier stomachs.

A contribution from you will go a long way toward improving our
kitchen and buying needed supplies for the upcoming school year. 
We hope to raise $10,000 through your generosity in order to
upgrade our church kitchen. With these upgrades we can provide a hot breakfast
to needy children, beginning on weekends.
Much of Jesus’ ministry was shared over a meal, often with those
less fortunate.  One thing Jesus always said was, “Feed the children

Won’t you join with us in feeding children first?
   What We Need: $10,000 might seem like a lot of money. Here is what your donations will go toward:  $6,000 will go toward updating our kitchen. This will help us serve the children in the community with our program.
$4,000 will go toward buying nutritious food for the kids. It will also help cover the cost of bowls/plate, utensils, napkins, and cups, and provide a lending library to growing minds to read while they eat. Even if we don't reach our desired goal, every penny will be used to help make our dream a reality.
Of course, there are perks that come along with donating to our cause.    The Impact: It might not seem like feeding children one meal a week will do much. However, studies show that a good breakfast will help children learn and improve their grades. Better grades can afford more opportunities for the students and affect the outcome of their lives.

    Other Ways You Can Help: Any way you can help is appreciated. Donate a dollar. Donate more. Even if you can't contribute monetarily, that doesn't mean you can't help. Get our message out there.

				“Torino is the <b>main city </b>of Piedmont region, in northwestern Italy.

In fact, Torino was the<b> first capital</b> of Italy and the home of its <b>royal family</b>, the House of Savoy. Many consider it to be the <b>European capital of Baroque</b>, as most of the historical city center was built in this style under the influence of Savoy family. The <b>2006 Winter Olympics</b> brought this half forgotten city under the <b>spotlight</b> and the whole world<b> rediscovered </b>its <b>aristocratic</b> <b>atmosphere</b>, the centre filled with <b>ancient cafes</b>, arcaded streets, restaurants and churches, its <b>grand boulevards </b>and <b>palaces</b>, <b>parks</b>, <b>museums</b> and <b>art galleries</b>.

				“When me and Iuliia started to plan our life together, I realized that my salary as IT consultant would not be enough for the both of us. Some months earlier, my father had retired, leaving his laboratory to collect dust. Pretty soon, we realized that that unused and dusty place represented a financial opportunity and we came up with the idea of starting a B&B activity.”
				
			









				“We are really enjoying this experience! To meet new people every day, help them discover the city and feel like at home give a lot of satisfaction. The B&B is very successful and so far we hosted more than 100 guests in just 6 months (If you want to check-out our listing on Airbnb, just check out the link in the project details). We are receiving more requests than we can satisfy, so we think it is now time to expand the activity!”
				
			












				“We recently found an apartment which would be the perfect opportunity to expand our B&B business. It can be easily divided into two independent units which could host from 2 to 4 people each, plus one room for group activities. Every unit will consist of night and day zone, small kitchen and private bathroom. Also the apartment is very close to us, in a very popular area for young people, right next to the city center, train station and metro. So we don’t want to lose this opportunity to acquire it. Crowdfunding is a wonderful way to turn ideas and motivation into reality. Besides the financial aspects, we would like to invite you to support us with feedback and ideas and help us perfect our project. We want you to travel to Torino and be our guests and feel that this B&B is what you have always been dreaming about”.















“We estimated our project budget at 160 000€. In details:
Acquisition of apartment (125 000€)
Taxes and bureaucracy (15 000€)
Renovation and decoration (20 000€)

We currently have 30 000€ of personal savings.Moreover, we can open a mortgage for 100 000€. To complete our project we need to raise 30 000€"".







				“In order to reach our fundraising goal, we designed perks to give back as much value as possible to our contributors. In fact, we are basically proposing you to spend your next vacation in our B&B in Torino (or to make a gift to a friend or a loved one)! After you contribute, we will get in contact with you to define details. When the campaign is over, we will update all contributors weekly with pictures and messages, to show our work progress and get feedback from the community”
				
			















				“Torino is the main city of Piedmont region, in northwestern Italy. While it is not a famous tourist destination like Florence, or Rome, it has one of the most longstanding cultural and artistic history in the country. In fact, Torino was the first capital of Italy and the home of its royal family, the House of Savoy. Many consider it to be the European capital of Baroque, as most of the historical city center was built in this style under the influence of Savoy family. The 2006 Winter Olympics brought this half forgotten city under the spotlight and the whole world rediscovered its aristocratic atmosphere, the centre filled with ancient cafes, arcaded streets, restaurants and churches, its grand boulevards and palaces, parks, museums and art galleries. Since then, Torino became an increasingly popular touristic destination, something you really don’t want to miss!”
				
			









				“We believe that travelling is not just about reaching a destination, but more about having the possibility to dive into a new culture and see life from a new perspective. In all our travels, we always preferred hostels and B&Bs to hotels and not because of price convenience. Our goal is to give our guests some cultural influence of Italy and Torino. We will provide our guests with some knowledge of Italian language, food and traditions. Also, we want to promote sharing information between guests. For example, in our B&B we have a suggestion book, where our guests have possibility to write their comments about the places they visited and have been impressed by, which future guests can take ideas from. We are focused on creating the basis for a unique travel experience, with all the comforts of a hotel.
Thanks to this fundraising, we will be able to create a common space to organize activities like Italian and cooking lessons and propose guided tours of Torino and nearby areas.”















“Yeap. It is not just our enthusiasm and passion which brings us here today. Our experience in this business gives us the confidence that, no matter what, we will bring this project to the end. Our current B&B room was originally the laboratory of my father. After he retired, it started to collect dust and became a storage room where to hide useless objects. While the laboratory stopped to produce money, it was still producing expenses for my parents in the form of taxes and bills each month. As we were striving to make a budget for our life together, we realized the potential of this abandoned asset; we proposed to my parents to take over all the expenses of the laboratory in change of the possibility to use it as we wanted.”








“Leveraging my passion for interior design, and Umberto's and his father's manual ability, with a lot of imagination and energy we turned this space into a cozy apartment in which we are now hosting tourists coming to visit Torino. Now we have fresh ideas on how to design next rooms which will make our guests, who are travelers in their hearts, to travel even easier, lighter and bring home a remarkable experience!”















				“In case the project is only partially funded, we have several backup plans:
90-99%: we will live on a very strict budget for some time, save the extra money and go from there :).
60-89%: we will downsize our project (look for a smaller apartment).

30-59%: we will look for an apartment on auction. This will greatly reduce acquisition costs but will significantly delay our project, as Italian bureaucracy can take up to 6-12 months before an apartment bought on auction is delivered to the buyer. 
less than 30%: we will use the money to make improvements to our current B&B room. 

In any case, we can assure you that all perks will be confirmed and we will be extremely happy to welcome in Torino our contributors!”









				“If you can’t give us any financial help, you can still share our story and this link with your friends, or support us with ideas and feedback. Whether you are an active traveler or you are working in the hosting business, or even if you just feel like you have something to say, we will appreciate your contribution very much!”",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>The connection between individuals &amp; the collective has always fascinated me. My passion and reason for funmaker initially was how music and dancing connects people together. Today it's much more. When people are united by a positive cause, in this case happiness, all fears inhibitions &amp; judgment fade away. With the right tools, people step into their unlimited awesomeness. Some of funmaker's tools are the headphones &amp; the quality of experience we create.</b></p>

<p><b>Since the first Funmaker party in Byron Bay (2013), I have witnessed an amazing type of communication – Happiness. It's infectious, It's collective and it's where we thrive as collective as in one.

<p><b>“And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.” Friedrich Nietzsche</b></p>
