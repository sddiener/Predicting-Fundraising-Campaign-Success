<p><strong>The Plan</strong></p>
<p>To allow children in Malawi, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic to attend summer camps where they will enjoy games, eat nutritious meals, learn Bible lessons, participate in skits, dance, sing, make crafts, play team sports, and simply enjoy being kids. Experiences like this allow children to develop confidence, make new friends, and learn things that will stay with them into adulthood.</p>

<p>All the children attending these camps have grown up in poverty in areas of the world where childhood is fraught with challenges. Many of them were orphaned or have lost at least one parent. Some have been affected by war, and others have seen the devastation of disease (such as Ebola in Sierra Leone). All the children have experienced the kinds of trauma that can rob childhood of its joy.</p>
<p>You can give that joy back!</p>

<h2>EARTHSHIP VILLAGE COLORADO</h2>
<p>(Prairie Sun Village)</p>
<p>My name is Sara and I am the land and project manager for Earthship Village Colorado. I have a background in working with the land, have multiple permaculture certifications and am active in my community creating healing businesses as well as educating my fellow citizens in the Pikes Peak Region on matters of sustainability. I have been a self employed business owner for 20 years, firstly owning an organic gardening company for 17 years and now own an organic herbal apothecary. I have a passion for creating truly sustainable, resilient and whole systems for the benefit of future generations.  </p>
<ul>
<li>We are now on the ground floor for building a community of totally off grid homes. This will create a model of ways to divest from fossil fuels and build homes that use ""trash"" for construction, helping to keep materials like tires, bottles and cans and used doors and windows out of the land fill. These homes also have the ability to grow food, allowing the occupants to create food security.  These homes first became popular in Taos, New Mexico and we are working with the people there to gain knowledge and understanding of how to build these homes with the greatest integrity possible.</li>
<li>By contributing to this campaign, you will help us to facilitate a home that will have many functions for our community. It will act as a visitors center, model home, event center, education center, overnight rental, and a glimpse of what is possible in housing. We will generate money from this house to fund other projects on the 400 acres, such as heavy equipment purchase, tree planting, animal husbandry, intern programs, and the building of more homes. Because banks will not finance these homes, we hope to create a system that builds upon itself so that we can eventually finance these homes for people within the structure of the community.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We are asking for $350,000. This will allow us to hire an experienced crew to help build as well as cover all costs for construction and permitting and outfit the house and greenhouse with furnishings and plants.</li>
<li>Our perks will allow for many to experience the uniqueness of an earthhship first hand. By staying in a fully functional off grid home, it will allow people to get excited about the possibilities of what can be done to shift into the age of clean and renewable energy!</li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal, we will use what funds we do raise to start the building process and continue to creatively finance the project.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>This is an incredibly valuable project in helping to blast out the value and do-ability of these types of homes. It allows us, as a society to begin the process of divesting from fossil fuels, create food security and value and reuse our water to achieve maximum usage for this delicate resource. It will also create resilient and whole systems housing for future generations facilitating the unfolding of true security. </li>
<li>The impact of this project is deep. It will without a doubt foster a powerful community of people looking for better ways to live on Earth. It will firstly be an educational tool for all ages and walks of life. It will also create employment and intern opportunities. This will be a destination for visitors to the area. This is to be the first of many of these houses to be built. It will provide resilant housing for future generations.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We do have our blueprint for the first house in place. They are designed to easily pass code and are stamped by architect Michael Reynolds, who is licensed in Colorado. The greatest challenge we foresee, aside from financing, is permitting within El Paso County. We are still technically within Colorado Springs city limits. There is one other home with similar design within our county, and we have been advised that it CAN be done, but we should expect some pushback.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are persistent and passionate and will go to great lengths to shed light on the great value of rainwater and water conservation through catchment systems.</li>
<li>We will strongly advocate and educate the value of these homes as our region is experiencing a massive population boom.</li>
</ul>

<p>The state of Jammu &amp; <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kashmir</a> faces frequent turmoil and unrest making it very difficult for the students in the state to attain formal <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">education</a>. Violence, coupled with curfews and shutdowns, has repeatedly disrupted <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">education</a> in the state making it hard for the students of this region to compete with others in various examinations; thereby hampering their career and future. With CM’s Super 50 Program we aim to focus on improving this situation and helping students in getting a quality <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">education</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last one year, schools and colleges in <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kashmir</a> have remained shut for 6 out of every 10 working days, leading to near-loss of entire academic year. In 2016, schooling could be conducted only for a period of four months in <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kashmir</a> valley and the 10th and 12th class exams held in November covered only 50 per cent of the total curriculum. Students of classes 1st to 9th were given mass promotion*.</p>

<p>Destruction of infrastructure, fear of sending children to schools, incorporation of youth into armed groups, negative economic shocks to households and forced displacement are few of the factors that inhibit students to attain proper <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">education</a>.</p>
<p>Our Program is designed to provide support and academic guidance to bright students of the region through special classes that focus on entrance examination preparation. Despite the turmoil, we strongly believe that by giving determined students the tools and guidance to move forward, they can acquire their seats in the most prestigious institutions of the country.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517815121/f1cibqv0ayz00yljri54.png"" src=""""/></h3>

<p>50 students each for engineering and medical entrance exams (IIT-JEE/NEET and the likes) are selected through an entrance test for each of the 11 centers spread across 10 districts of <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kashmir</a>.

<p>Collected funds would be used for the below-mentioned activities:</p>
<p><strong>1. TEACHER TRAINING &amp; SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p>Orientation and training sessions are conducted for all teachers supporting the program to equip them with pedagogical tools needed to run classrooms. In addition, mid-cycle refresher training is conducted to review the progress at each center and provide support to teachers as necessary. Moreover, academic and <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">education</a>al support is provided to all teachers on a regular basis to ensure a smooth functioning of the program. </p>
<p><strong>2. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT </strong></p>
<p>Avanti/CHINAR Program Managers <strong>​</strong>coordinate the on-ground project implementation by conducting school visits, providing ongoing academic support and resolving any issues hampering the smooth functioning of the program.</p>
<p><strong>3. CURRICULUM SUPPORT &amp; ASSESSMENTS</strong></p>

<li>
<strong>​</strong>​DIGITAL CONTENT SUPPORT: Teachers are provided with digital content (including class-wise lesson-plans, video lectures etc.) to prepare them for classroom sessions</li>
<li>WORKBOOKS:  In-class practice, as well as homework workbooks, are provided to students</li>
<li>REGULAR TESTS: Consistent tests based on the actual exam pattern are given to students in order to familiarize and acquaint them with the exam pattern</li>

<p>Avanti is an award winning social enterprise established by IIT &amp; Harvard University alumni in 2010 to provide an affordable, high-quality <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">education</a> to disadvantaged students aspiring to study at <a href=""#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">India</a>’s top colleges. Today Avanti employs over 250 teachers, 300 staff-members and works with over 6,000 students in direct face-to-face teaching programs run by Avanti’s teachers. Avanti works with an additional 6,000 students and 250 teachers through its teacher training programs focused on integrating a blended learning curriculum into government schools.</p>

</div></div>","The state of Jammu & Kashmir faces frequent turmoil and unrest making it very difficult for the students in the state to attain formal education. Violence, coupled with curfews and shutdowns, has repeatedly disrupted education in the state making it hard for the students of this region to compete with others in various examinations; thereby hampering their career and future. With CM’s Super 50 Program we aim to focus on improving this situation and helping students in getting a quality education.
Over the last one year, schools and colleges in Kashmir have remained shut for 6 out of every 10 working days, leading to near-loss of entire academic year. In 2016, schooling could be conducted only for a period of four months in Kashmir valley and the 10th and 12th class exams held in November covered only 50 per cent of the total curriculum. Students of classes 1st to 9th were given mass promotion*.

Destruction of infrastructure, fear of sending children to schools, incorporation of youth into armed groups, negative economic shocks to households and forced displacement are few of the factors that inhibit students to attain proper education.
Our Program is designed to provide support and academic guidance to bright students of the region through special classes that focus on entrance examination preparation. Despite the turmoil, we strongly believe that by giving determined students the tools and guidance to move forward, they can acquire their seats in the most prestigious institutions of the country.


50 students each for engineering and medical entrance exams (IIT-JEE/NEET and the likes) are selected through an entrance test for each of the 11 centers spread across 10 districts of Kashmir. These students are then coached in an intensive crash course from December to April/May by subject experts chosen from the existing set of government teachers in the state.
 

The entire program is based on the years of experience CHINAR International has from addressing the issues and problems in Kashmir and by using Avanti's robust curriculum and pedagogy that is successfully implemented across 11 states in the country.

Collected funds would be used for the below-mentioned activities:
1. TEACHER TRAINING & SUPPORT
Orientation and training sessions are conducted for all teachers supporting the program to equip them with pedagogical tools needed to run classrooms. In addition, mid-cycle refresher training is conducted to review the progress at each center and provide support to teachers as necessary. Moreover, academic and educational support is provided to all teachers on a regular basis to ensure a smooth functioning of the program. 
2. PROGRAM MANAGEMENT 
Avanti/CHINAR Program Managers ​coordinate the on-ground project implementation by conducting school visits, providing ongoing academic support and resolving any issues hampering the smooth functioning of the program.
3. CURRICULUM SUPPORT & ASSESSMENTS


​​DIGITAL CONTENT SUPPORT: Teachers are provided with digital content (including class-wise lesson-plans, video lectures etc.) to prepare them for classroom sessions
WORKBOOKS:  In-class practice, as well as homework workbooks, are provided to students
REGULAR TESTS: Consistent tests based on the actual exam pattern are given to students in order to familiarize and acquaint them with the exam pattern


In addition, the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) is providing support in printing the modules and workbooks.
A small donation of  INR 1,500 or just $25 will help fund one student - every dollar counts and will help us in moving a step closer to helping students realize their dream of getting into top colleges! In addition, you can choose to have some exclusive handcrafted items from Kashmir by selecting any of the perks mentioned on the page.

I was born and raised in Miami to parents of Haitian descent. Despite my background living in a low income neighborhood, I managed to avoid street life, drugs and gangs, and instead was able to excel in my academics. I recently graduated from Florida International University and have been accepted into Columbia University School of the Arts for their Writing MFA. The purpose of this particular campaign is to assist me with funding for my first semester. I've struggled financially these past few months (not from lack of applying for jobs; rather I've had difficulty finding employment) and need assistance with paying my tuition deposit (which is $600) and with paying for housing. July 24, I was given an offer of accommodation for on-campus housing from Columbia and I only have a short amount of time from when I receive the offer (until mid-August) to make a payment that secures my housing (similar to a security deposit for an apartment) which is $1000. I genuinely have no means to obtain that amount of money on my own in such a short amount of time, and this is why I'm reaching out for assistance. I've always loved to write and do photography and my career goal is to become an author, and being able to attend such a prestigious school as Columbia would be a life-changing opportunity in this regard.

My name is Felton Pierre and I'm an aspiring writer. I was born and raised in Miami to parents of Haitian descent. Despite my background living in a low income neighborhood, I managed to avoid street life, drugs and gangs, and instead was able to excel in my academics. I recently graduated from Florida International University and have been accepted into Columbia University School of the Arts for their Writing MFA. The purpose of this particular campaign is to assist me with funding for my first semester. I've struggled financially these past few months (not from lack of applying for jobs; rather I've had difficulty finding employment) and need assistance with paying my tuition deposit (which is $600) and with paying for housing.

<h3>WHO ARE WE</h3>
<p>My name is Cheri Reid I'm the owner of BIG HUGS INC. I operate my mentoring company with my husband John Reid. BIG HUGS has been in operation for 10 years and was fully funded by John and I through our personal finances and private donations through our  family members. You may ask yourself why did we do it this way? well we saw an emergency need in my community and we acted with our hearts. We saw too many kids going to jail, dropping out of school, and not dreaming. I came up with a program that would focus on mentoring, hot meals for the entire family, day care at the development stage six weeks through 3 years old, homework help, none of our children ever leaves BIG HUGS without hugs and their homework done every night. This program  has lead to IEP's going up and most of our kids are now students of the month and math champs of the month and most of all the kids are now smiling everyday. Homework not being completed was one of the main complaints from the parents who  had their children attending other programs. Most of kids come from broken homes or single parent homes and most of our parents don't get homes until late at night and this has lead to homework not being done so we sprung into action and hired junior staff members these are young adults who come from shelters, projects, and foster care who maintain good grades and we pay them to tutor and help with the homework help. This helps to add income to their families as well as help them gain self-esteem. We also do college tours our kids have been to Fairfield University, Princeton University, Yale University, and my Alma Mater Mercy College all trips taken are free, all tee-shirts are free. We keep everything free for the parents because I saw how my dad felt when he could not provide activities for me because he had to choose to put food in my mouth and pay the rent. so when I started this program I promised all parents who enrolled their children all trips would be free. Our motto is Education Through a Parent's Perspective. This means that I was once a parent myself and I knew how scary it was to let my children go with strangers in the beginning. I also know how unique every kid is and that the parent is the best person to guide myself and my staff on what their child needs most from my program. We accept all kids we also accept all kids who parent no income no child is ever turned away.</p>

<div>THE COOPERATIVE NETWORK</div>
<p></p>
<p>I will start to work with 4 women, then spread up to 8 or more, depending on the demand.  When one family starts doing well they invite their cousins or aunts to work with the cooperative. My dream is to improve the life of their whole family with this production, starting from the elders, to the mothers &amp; their children. </p>
<p>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449971384/ge4hbwhxltdql6a36ubk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>  
<p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I will work at first with 4 weaver women, then as the
     brand gets bigger I will keep training-employing more members of their family and
     community. </li>
<li>I will teach then how to administrate their resources &amp; invest in their future.</li>
<li>The long term vision is to branch out and work with
     Indigenous artists-artisans in other countries too, such as: Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, etc.  to help them activate their own online business and branding. I already have the connections with Indigenous leaders and artisans who want to be part of the dream, and who also need help to link up their crafts and arts.</li>
<li>The reason im so passionate about this project, is that
     the critical living situation of this Mayan women and children (and the majority of Indigenous people in Latin Amerikua who live in harsh conditions) is one that I know and trust can be solved with the support of other awakened and empathetic beings form around the world. </li>
<li>The impact that this project will have on this
     communities will improve dramatically the extreme poverty in which they
     live in, and this will allow their kids to go to school,  + it will allow
     the whole family to eat better, and to have some free time, rather than be working on the cold streets all day. </li>
<li>whenever the production line becomes steady and gets
     positioned in several markets around the world, I will act as an economic
     advisor for the women in the cooperative, and suggest them to direct their
     money to fix their homes rather than buying a plasma Tv,  when the
     time is right I will also introduce them to sustainable technologies such
     as water captation systems, green houses, permaculture, etc.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<p><b>THE CHALLENGE</b></p>
<p>This women and children live in another rhythm of life, a more slow pace , so it will take me time to adjust to their needs, and learn their ways. But im willing and ready to spend quality time with this culture,  through many years I have admired immensely their work, and have felt powerless to do more than emptiying my wallet on them, or taking them for lunch. So after much thinking and feeling for them, this vision came together as a solution. I know you will want to be part of the solution to help bring ease to the people who are the most affected by our globalization.</p>

My name is Maia Balam, I am a Mexican filmmaker and activist, with the mission
of giving voice to the people of the land, those who stand in the front lines against globalization and ecocide: the
Indigenous people that have been inhabiting the earth in a respectful way for
thousands of years, but whom have been abused by the destructive agendas of
capitalism for hundredths of years. 
One day upon walking the streets of San Cristobal de las Casas Chiapas (a

humble mothers and their hungry children: 
With the aid of the global community I will help them design a proper
fair trade clothing & jewelry brand that gives them a steady income, and
that will help them sell and ship their products all over the world,  I
will also create a short film series around their craft-art & life in order
to share their stories and culture with Mexico and the rest of world.

WHAT WE NEED TO WEAVE DREAMS
THE COOPERATIVE NETWORK

I will start to work with 4 women, then spread up to 8 or more, depending on the demand.  When one family starts doing well they invite their cousins or aunts to work with the cooperative. My dream is to improve the life of their whole family with this production, starting from the elders, to the mothers & their children. 
                            
THE IMPACT

I will work at first with 4 weaver women, then as the
     brand gets bigger I will keep training-employing more members of their family and
     community. 
I will teach then how to administrate their resources & invest in their future.
The long term vision is to branch out and work with
     Indigenous artists-artisans in other countries too, such as: Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, etc.  to help them activate their own online business and branding. I already have the connections with Indigenous leaders and artisans who want to be part of the dream, and who also need help to link up their crafts and arts.
The reason im so passionate about this project, is that
     the critical living situation of this Mayan women and children (and the majority of Indigenous people in Latin Amerikua who live in harsh conditions) is one that I know and trust can be solved with the support of other awakened and empathetic beings form around the world. 
The impact that this project will have on this
     communities will improve dramatically the extreme poverty in which they
     live in, and this will allow their kids to go to school,  + it will allow
     the whole family to eat better, and to have some free time, rather than be working on the cold streets all day. 
whenever the production line becomes steady and gets
     positioned in several markets around the world, I will act as an economic
     advisor for the women in the cooperative, and suggest them to direct their
     money to fix their homes rather than buying a plasma Tv,  when the
     time is right I will also introduce them to sustainable technologies such
     as water captation systems, green houses, permaculture, etc.


THE CHALLENGE
This women and children live in another rhythm of life, a more slow pace , so it will take me time to adjust to their needs, and learn their ways. But im willing and ready to spend quality time with this culture,  through many years I have admired immensely their work, and have felt powerless to do more than emptiying my wallet on them, or taking them for lunch. So after much thinking and feeling for them, this vision came together as a solution. I know you will want to be part of the solution to help bring ease to the people who are the most affected by our globalization.

<p>After hearing the story about Ahmed Mohamed from Irving, Texas, we decided to do something to help STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education in immigrant communities. We're bringing a little humor and creating a clock in the shape of a cartoon bomb. </p>
<p>When you buy this clock, all profits will be used to create a scholarship fund for school STEM programs in high schools across the US.</p>
<h3>The Clocks</h3>
<p>You can buy one of three clock models. All clocks will be made from black glossy hard plastic. The first is the ""Bomb Math Clock"", with mathematical expressions on the dial instead of number. The ""Bomb Numbers Clock"" will have standard numbers. Finally, the ""Round Math Clock"" will be round, but will have the math face.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442845106/e8mqjmdo8q2xaevqtm3a.png"" src="""" style=""width: 622.88px; height: 216px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/></p>
<p>The price is the same. If you buy any clock, you are contributing to the scholarship fund.</p>
<h3>The Scholarship Fund</h3>
<p>After subtracting costs, all the  money from this campaign will be donated to a scholarship fund that gives grants to schools serving predominantly immigrant communities.</p>
<p>The fund will look at the following factors when determining grants:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span>Only fund STEM programs and departments.</span></p></li>
<li><p>Any teacher or school in the US can apply.</p></li>
<li><p>At least 20% of students affected by the proposal must be children of immigrants.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposals will be ranked based on creativity, educational value, and the financial need of the school.</p></li>
<li><p>Public institutions only. No private schools.</p></li>
<li><p>Proposals must include specific equipment and program acquisitions.</p></li>
<li>$1,000 to $10,000 per grant (or more if we raise more money).</li>
</ol>
<p>Sample projects that would be funded are the purchase of robotic kits, chemistry kits, telescopes, microscopes and other lab equipment. Trips to labs, museums or animal sanctuaries. Competitions and fairs. Basically anything that inspires kids to pursue STEM.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>Immigrants face many challenges. Their daily struggles usually don't elicit a national outcry. Instead they have to pull themselves up by their own courage after being beaten down, and with help from unsung heroes all over the country that understand the value of education and human dignity.</p>
<p>This project is about science. It's about education. It's about fairness and opportunity. Your clock tells everyone where you stand. And, if we are successful in this campaign, your support will help immigrants pursue their dreams through our scholarship fund.</p>

The fuse is a nylon rope with a metallic core.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The first challenge will be building the clocks. We have researched and contacted manufacturers.

We won't know for sure until we know how many clocks we have to build after this campaign closes.</p>
<p>The second challenge is distributing the money to schools in need. We will either find a foundation aligned with our goals or create one with a Board of Trustees to oversee it. There are legal hurdles and tax implications for every decision. Part of the money will be spent on lawyers and accountants to make sure everything is done right. Even more challenging will be sorting through the applications and making funding choices.</p>
<h3>Donations and Sharing</h3>
<p>If you like our goals, please share this project with your friends.</p>
<p>We also accept direct donations to the scholarship fund. Your donations will not be used to pay for any manufacturing costs, so it goes directly to help schools. If you are interested in donating more than $100, please contact us directly for more information.</p>

We have developed a theoretical framework to contextualize our curriculum in order to better address the specific needs of Syrian refugees – with a focus on girls – and adapt to the resources available in a particular conflict-affected setting. Students can access the program's learning content through an application, with on-line and off-line functionality. If successful, our program model can also be tailored to other conflict or emergency contexts. We expect to later extended mobile learning programs to the MENA region, along with Africa and Asia, where the need for education is extensive. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>""App Provides Education For Migrants On The Move""</h1>On December 29, 2015 CNN's Alison Kosik interviewed Aliim's Founder &amp; CEO, Janae Bushman live about this crowdfunding campaign and about our smartphone drive (see aliim.org for information about the drive). <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">See the link below to watch the CNN video. </span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451410824/iu5ov0jatzqqepjbs1zu.png"" src="""" style=""width: 294px; height: 171px;""/></p><p><a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/business/2015/12/29/app-for-refugees-aliim-ceo-wbt.cnn.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">""App Provides Education For Migrants On The Move""</a></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h1>""Technology and smartphones could help to educate refugees""</h1><br/><p>On November 30, 2015 CNBC's Luke Graham, published about our innovative Smartphone Schools Program and the impact our program can have on refugees. <br/></p><p>See the link below to read the article.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448925916/kmzlihkzlq74qegif9db.png"" src="""" style=""""/>   <a href=""http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/30/technology-smartphones-could-educate-refugees.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Technology and Smartphones Could Help to Educate Refugees""</a></p><h1><br/></h1><h3><b>2.7 Million Syrian Out-Of-School Children</b></h3><p>Following 4 years of conflict, more than 2.7 million Syrian children don’t have access to any kind of education. Many of them have missed out on 2 to 3 years of school and are now verging on becoming a lost generation.</p><p>With each lost year of schooling, the chance that these youth will return to formal education greatly diminishes, leaving those who will eventually be responsible for rebuilding their country with little hope for a future.</p><p><b>Girls Are Particularly at Risk</b></p><p>While the rate of child and forced marriage was already significant in Syria before the war, it dramatically increased following the current crisis, excluding girls from the secondary school system and exposing them to dangerous early pregnancy or a higher risk of domestic violence. In Lebanon, 18% of Syrian girls, ages 15 to 18 are married (against 2% for boys).</p><p>Many reports highlight the fact that girls are more likely to be kept at home as a consequence of security issues, especially sexual and gender-based violence, which are realities of the life in refugee camps. To learn more about the dramatic consequences of the Syrian crisis on girls, click <a href=""https://www.rescue.org/sites/default/files/resource-file/IRC_WomenInSyria_Report_WEB.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p><p><b>Malala's Voice</b></p><p>The Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai, is especially an inspiration to us at Aliim.

We believe that mobile learning can extend the work of organizations like the Malala Fund, to bring education beyond the walls of the classroom and into the hands of refugee girls who cannot come to school. With permission from the Malala Foundation, we wanted to share a beautiful short film that lends Malala's voice to the urgency behind reaching out to refugee girls and the impact we all can have as we work towards including  more girls in formal or non-formal education. </p><p><br/></p><h3><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""247"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F141719321&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F141719321&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F538800883_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div></h3><h3>

<h3>Education Is the Key</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>Education is more than a fundamental human right. It is essential to the exercise of all other human rights. By also providing youth with the right tools to understand the world they live in and empowering them to fully and positively take part in the society, education is crucial to achieving global goals. At Aliim, we believe that education is the key to a better world.</p><p>In the specific context of the Syrian crisis, education can mitigate some of the risks that refugees face, especially girls. Safe learning environments can protect them from getting trapped in cheap labor or early marriage and empower them to stand for their rights.</p><br/><h3>Our Plans for 2016</h3><h3></h3><p>Based on the results of a field survey we conducted in Lebanon and several recent publications on refugee educational needs, we have developed a theoretical framework to contextualize our curriculum in order to better address the specific needs of Syrian refugees – with a focus on girls – and adapt to the resources available in a particular conflict-affected setting.</p><p>We are now seeking donations to launch the Smartphone Schools pilot program in Sidon and Akkar, Lebanon. Aliim will use 100 percent of the proceeds to develop out the program, including:</p><p>1) Developing the program’s curriculum further and uploading it to the mobile learning platform;</p><p>2) Provide students with basic smartphones ($40 each) and solar panels for charging, along with wifi and data plans;</p><p>3) Staff salary on the ground in Lebanon to oversee the implementation of the program;</p><p>4) Provide TOEFL tests for each student learning English; and</p><p>5) Impact evaluations to ensure we are effectively meeting the program’s learning objectives.</p><p>We can provide all this for just under <b>$34 a month per student</b> ($300 per student for a full school year), with a goal of serving 250 Syrian refugee children ages 12 to 16 (mainly girls) in the pilot program.</p><p><b>What if we don’t reach our goal?</b></p><p>Every dollar counts. We are currently looking for corporate partners and applying for grants and will keep up our fundraising efforts until the pilot program is launched.</p><p><b>What if we exceed our goal?</b></p><p>The more we bring in during this campaign, the more out-of-school students we we can reach and enroll into our program. $75,000 USD is the minimum to get started, which provide Smartphone Schools to 250 refugees for a full school year. Beyond the baseline goal, our stretch goal is $150,000, with which we can reach hundreds of additional refugee children. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448266514/vhhvfyxuqlxcitqgtpug.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>Learn More About Our Unique Curriculum</h3><h3></h3><p>Our Smartphone Schools Program is not only about giving out-of-school Syrian youth the chance to acquire crucial knowledge and encouraging them to study further. It aims at empowering the next generation of Syrians, especially girls, to have a positive impact on their new community within their country of asylum. It also prepares youth to become active contributors to both the local and global economy, and eventually participate in reconstructing Syria when the war is over.</p><p>To reach these goals, and based on the results of our needs assessment, we designed our curriculum to include relevant skills, special learning features, and a series of innovative pedagogical tools to make our program unique.</p><p><b>Our International Mentor Network</b></p><p>Our Smartphone School program includes interaction with an international network of mentors who will accompany students throughout the nine months, giving them feedback and answering their questions. With mobile technology, our mentors can live anywhere in the world. We believe that mentoring is an essential aspect of the program. By giving youth the opportunity to obtain the support they need from people all around the world, we intend to create a real community, allowing them to get guidance even after they finish the program, and eventually opening them professional opportunities.</p><p><b>Giving Children a Voice</b></p><p>If we bring school to youth through technology, why not leverage this channel to give them a voice? Our blog “Voices of Peace” will be a platform for students and youth around the world to interact with each other and the global community by sharing poetry, essays, photography, and artwork.</p><p><b>Our English Module</b></p><p>Beyond limited spots for Syrian refugees in public schools, one of the main obstacle for Syrian youth to access education in their host countries is language. This is particularly the case in Lebanon, where education is taught in English and French. Our English curriculum will be designed to prepare students to TOEFL certification in order to facilitate their integration into formal schools. Beyond this aspect, English skills can make a huge difference for Syrian refugees who continue their journey in other countries, especially in Europe, where the majority arrives with little other language skills than Arabic, experiencing crippling communication issues.</p><p><b>Our Citizenship Module</b></p><p>The goal of Aliim’s Citizenship curriculum is to empower students to engage with their new community in a positive way, enjoy and exercise their rights, and to think critically about their surrounding and society, looking to credible information sources to help them in this process. We are convinced that our students could have an even greater impact on their environment by diffusing these values.</p><p>Besides lessons on basic Human Rights, the curriculum will include a special focus on tolerance and gender equality. We want girls to be aware of their rights and boys to stand up for them.The citizenship curriculum will also provide students concrete information on local institutions and organizations in order for them to know who to turn to in case they encounter specific difficulties.</p><p><b>Our Entrepreneurship Module</b></p><p>The Entrepreneurship curriculum will present foundational business concepts with a special focus on innovation and solution finding. More than knowledge, this curriculum aims at inspiring our students to dare dream of a better tomorrow and  what we would like to provide them with the Entrepreneurship module.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Get to Know Aliim's Team</h3><h3></h3><p><i>In a mobilized world, we believe that it is possible to fulfill every child’s right to education.</i></p><p>Aliim’s team is a global network of individuals who share a passion for technology and the ways we can leverage it to achieve global goals. We are committed to helping marginalized youth to reach their full potential by providing them access to education and empowering them to fully take part in the society.</p><p>From the United States to Lebanon, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Uganda, Aliim’s team’s member combine over 40 years of experience in  teaching, curriculum design, finance, marketing, management consulting, human rights law, e-commerce, engineering, programming, strategic planning, evaluations, data analysis, fundraising, and program implementation.</p><p><b>Local Partners</b></p><p>Aliim works with local partners including, the Center for Applied Research in Education (CARE) at the University of Notre Dame, Louaize. CARE and our other partners help us connect the needs of the local communities with our mobile learning curriculum to ensure we provide the most relevant and applicable skills in a way that follows international education in emergency guidelines.</p><h3><b><br/></b></h3><h3><b>What Motivates Us</b></h3><h3></h3><p><i><b>Echoes From a Lost Generation, Janae’s Grandmother</b></i></p><p>“After surviving the atomic bomb in Hiroshima at age 12, my Japanese grandmother spent the rest of her school days helping to rebuild the city. This left her with no options for continuing her education and no skills beyond menial labor. Her eyes tell the story of shame and regret that many individuals who miss out on a basic education carry for the rest of their lives. I can't turn back time and I can't take my grandmother's pain away, but I can make sure that future generations can find hope and resilience through education, despite the atrocities of war. In Japanese culture, paper cranes are a symbol of hope after hardship. It is said that if you give 1,000 paper cranes, your wish will come true. In memory of my grandmother and to all who are part of a lost generation, my wish is that all children can claim their right to education during times of war, so that they can have the  liberties that my grandmother and millions of others lacked.”</p><div>                                                  <i style=""font-weight: normal;""> - Janae, Aliim Founder, USA</i>

<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i><br/></i></span><p><i><b>The Burden Of Refugees</b></i></p>
<p>“I first witnessed the reality of displaced communities a few years ago, during an internship at the National Agency for Support and Integration of Refugees (ANAIR) in Mauritania. The agency was in charge of repatriating nationals who had  been unlawfully expelled from the country during 20 years. There, I realized the burden refugees face after years away. Rebuilding communities, starting new lives, reviving the economy are no easy tasks, especially in a context of poverty or in post-conflicts settings. This experience triggered my commitment to helping refugees in their host countries to keep living, learning, evolving, so that when the day comes and they can finally go home, they are better equipped to face the huge challenges awaiting them.”    </p>

</div><h3><br/></h3><h3>FAQs</h3><h3></h3><p>Q. Where are you headquartered?</p><p>A. Aliim Corporation, known as “Aliim”, is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, headquartered in New York, with team members located in Lebanon, Germany, the Netherlands, Mexico, Uganda, and the U.S.</p><p>Q. What does Aliim mean?</p><p>A. Aliim is a derivative of the noun “تعلم”  which means “learning, education, study” in Arabic.</p><p>Q. What kind of smartphone is required to use your learning platform?</p><p>A. Any Android based smartphone.</p><p>Q. What if the youth don’t have access to a smartphone?</p><p>A. Our field survey showed that most of them do. However, we intend to equip each student with a basic smartphone for our pilot program.</p><p>Q. How will your program keep tabs on the children who receive the smartphones? Will they receive assignments and ongoing correspondence from teachers, or is all coursework completed through the app?</p><p>A. We will keep track of each student’s progress through the classroom management platform accessed through an app on the smartphone, which notifies the student, their parents, mentors, and Aliim program supervisors of important learning indicators. When a student is struggling with a specific concept, the student’s assigned mentor will reach out to the student directly through the app to provide support. Supplemental learning material will also be provided through the app. If needed, the student’s mentor may go over the supplemental learning materials with the student, providing further explanations over a video conferencing platform like Skype. If problems persist, Aliim supervisors will meet with the student and their parents in person to discuss what additional support the student needs to progress through the program.</p><p>Q. Won’t access to electricity and Internet be an obstacle for children’s participation?  </p><p>A. 3G/4G coverage is sufficient in most parts of the region. Access to electricity however can be difficult in some remote areas or overcrowded camps.

Aliim is a non-profit organization whose mission is to leverage technology and mentors to provide refugees and marginalized youth access to safe, quality, and relevant education.Smartphone Schools ProgramAliim’s Smartphone Schools Program is the first mobile learning program that aims to empower Syrian refugee youth living in the Levant or migrating to other regions of the world, to continue their education and access better economic opportunities through technology and a global network of mentors. We have developed a theoretical framework to contextualize our curriculum in order to better address the specific needs of Syrian refugees – with a focus on girls – and adapt to the resources available in a particular conflict-affected setting. Students can access the program's learning content through an application, with on-line and off-line functionality. If successful, our program model can also be tailored to other conflict or emergency contexts. We expect to later extended mobile learning programs to the MENA region, along with Africa and Asia, where the need for education is extensive. ""App Provides Education For Migrants On The Move""On December 29, 2015 CNN's Alison Kosik interviewed Aliim's Founder & CEO, Janae Bushman live about this crowdfunding campaign and about our smartphone drive (see aliim.org for information about the drive). See the link below to watch the CNN video. ""App Provides Education For Migrants On The Move""""Technology and smartphones could help to educate refugees""On November 30, 2015 CNBC's Luke Graham, published about our innovative Smartphone Schools Program and the impact our program can have on refugees. See the link below to read the article.   ""Technology and Smartphones Could Help to Educate Refugees""2.7 Million Syrian Out-Of-School ChildrenFollowing 4 years of conflict, more than 2.7 million Syrian children don’t have access to any kind of education. Many of them have missed out on 2 to 3 years of school and are now verging on becoming a lost generation.With each lost year of schooling, the chance that these youth will return to formal education greatly diminishes, leaving those who will eventually be responsible for rebuilding their country with little hope for a future.Girls Are Particularly at RiskWhile the rate of child and forced marriage was already significant in Syria before the war, it dramatically increased following the current crisis, excluding girls from the secondary school system and exposing them to dangerous early pregnancy or a higher risk of domestic violence. In Lebanon, 18% of Syrian girls, ages 15 to 18 are married (against 2% for boys).Many reports highlight the fact that girls are more likely to be kept at home as a consequence of security issues, especially sexual and gender-based violence, which are realities of the life in refugee camps. To learn more about the dramatic consequences of the Syrian crisis on girls, click here.Malala's VoiceThe Nobel Peace Prize winner, Malala Yousafzai, is especially an inspiration to us at Aliim. Malala recently built a school in Lebanon for Syrian refugee girls. We believe that mobile learning can extend the work of organizations like the Malala Fund, to bring education beyond the walls of the classroom and into the hands of refugee girls who cannot come to school. With permission from the Malala Foundation, we wanted to share a beautiful short film that lends Malala's voice to the urgency behind reaching out to refugee girls and the impact we all can have as we work towards including  more girls in formal or non-formal education. 

Education Is the Key

Education is more than a fundamental human right. It is essential to the exercise of all other human rights. By also providing youth with the right tools to understand the world they live in and empowering them to fully and positively take part in the society, education is crucial to achieving global goals. At Aliim, we believe that education is the key to a better world.In the specific context of the Syrian crisis, education can mitigate some of the risks that refugees face, especially girls. Safe learning environments can protect them from getting trapped in cheap labor or early marriage and empower them to stand for their rights.Our Plans for 2016Based on the results of a field survey we conducted in Lebanon and several recent publications on refugee educational needs, we have developed a theoretical framework to contextualize our curriculum in order to better address the specific needs of Syrian refugees – with a focus on girls – and adapt to the resources available in a particular conflict-affected setting.We are now seeking donations to launch the Smartphone Schools pilot program in Sidon and Akkar, Lebanon. Aliim will use 100 percent of the proceeds to develop out the program, including:1) Developing the program’s curriculum further and uploading it to the mobile learning platform;2) Provide students with basic smartphones ($40 each) and solar panels for charging, along with wifi and data plans;3) Staff salary on the ground in Lebanon to oversee the implementation of the program;4) Provide TOEFL tests for each student learning English; and5) Impact evaluations to ensure we are effectively meeting the program’s learning objectives.We can provide all this for just under $34 a month per student ($300 per student for a full school year), with a goal of serving 250 Syrian refugee children ages 12 to 16 (mainly girls) in the pilot program.What if we don’t reach our goal?Every dollar counts. We are currently looking for corporate partners and applying for grants and will keep up our fundraising efforts until the pilot program is launched.What if we exceed our goal?The more we bring in during this campaign, the more out-of-school students we we can reach and enroll into our program. $75,000 USD is the minimum to get started, which provide Smartphone Schools to 250 refugees for a full school year. Beyond the baseline goal, our stretch goal is $150,000, with which we can reach hundreds of additional refugee children. Learn More About Our Unique CurriculumOur Smartphone Schools Program is not only about giving out-of-school Syrian youth the chance to acquire crucial knowledge and encouraging them to study further. It aims at empowering the next generation of Syrians, especially girls, to have a positive impact on their new community within their country of asylum. It also prepares youth to become active contributors to both the local and global economy, and eventually participate in reconstructing Syria when the war is over.To reach these goals, and based on the results of our needs assessment, we designed our curriculum to include relevant skills, special learning features, and a series of innovative pedagogical tools to make our program unique.Our International Mentor NetworkOur Smartphone School program includes interaction with an international network of mentors who will accompany students throughout the nine months, giving them feedback and answering their questions. With mobile technology, our mentors can live anywhere in the world. We believe that mentoring is an essential aspect of the program. By giving youth the opportunity to obtain the support they need from people all around the world, we intend to create a real community, allowing them to get guidance even after they finish the program, and eventually opening them professional opportunities.Giving Children a VoiceIf we bring school to youth through technology, why not leverage this channel to give them a voice? Our blog “Voices of Peace” will be a platform for students and youth around the world to interact with each other and the global community by sharing poetry, essays, photography, and artwork.Our English ModuleBeyond limited spots for Syrian refugees in public schools, one of the main obstacle for Syrian youth to access education in their host countries is language. This is particularly the case in Lebanon, where education is taught in English and French. Our English curriculum will be designed to prepare students to TOEFL certification in order to facilitate their integration into formal schools. Beyond this aspect, English skills can make a huge difference for Syrian refugees who continue their journey in other countries, especially in Europe, where the majority arrives with little other language skills than Arabic, experiencing crippling communication issues.Our Citizenship ModuleThe goal of Aliim’s Citizenship curriculum is to empower students to engage with their new community in a positive way, enjoy and exercise their rights, and to think critically about their surrounding and society, looking to credible information sources to help them in this process. We are convinced that our students could have an even greater impact on their environment by diffusing these values.Besides lessons on basic Human Rights, the curriculum will include a special focus on tolerance and gender equality. We want girls to be aware of their rights and boys to stand up for them.The citizenship curriculum will also provide students concrete information on local institutions and organizations in order for them to know who to turn to in case they encounter specific difficulties.Our Entrepreneurship ModuleThe Entrepreneurship curriculum will present foundational business concepts with a special focus on innovation and solution finding. More than knowledge, this curriculum aims at inspiring our students to dare dream of a better tomorrow and  what we would like to provide them with the Entrepreneurship module.Get to Know Aliim's TeamIn a mobilized world, we believe that it is possible to fulfill every child’s right to education.Aliim’s team is a global network of individuals who share a passion for technology and the ways we can leverage it to achieve global goals. We are committed to helping marginalized youth to reach their full potential by providing them access to education and empowering them to fully take part in the society.From the United States to Lebanon, Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Uganda, Aliim’s team’s member combine over 40 years of experience in  teaching, curriculum design, finance, marketing, management consulting, human rights law, e-commerce, engineering, programming, strategic planning, evaluations, data analysis, fundraising, and program implementation.Local PartnersAliim works with local partners including, the Center for Applied Research in Education (CARE) at the University of Notre Dame, Louaize. CARE and our other partners help us connect the needs of the local communities with our mobile learning curriculum to ensure we provide the most relevant and applicable skills in a way that follows international education in emergency guidelines.What Motivates UsEchoes From a Lost Generation, Janae’s Grandmother“After surviving the atomic bomb in Hiroshima at age 12, my Japanese grandmother spent the rest of her school days helping to rebuild the city. This left her with no options for continuing her education and no skills beyond menial labor. Her eyes tell the story of shame and regret that many individuals who miss out on a basic education carry for the rest of their lives. I can't turn back time and I can't take my grandmother's pain away, but I can make sure that future generations can find hope and resilience through education, despite the atrocities of war. In Japanese culture, paper cranes are a symbol of hope after hardship. It is said that if you give 1,000 paper cranes, your wish will come true. In memory of my grandmother and to all who are part of a lost generation, my wish is that all children can claim their right to education during times of war, so that they can have the  liberties that my grandmother and millions of others lacked.”                                                   - Janae, Aliim Founder, USA

The Burden Of Refugees
“I first witnessed the reality of displaced communities a few years ago, during an internship at the National Agency for Support and Integration of Refugees (ANAIR) in Mauritania. The agency was in charge of repatriating nationals who had  been unlawfully expelled from the country during 20 years. There, I realized the burden refugees face after years away. Rebuilding communities, starting new lives, reviving the economy are no easy tasks, especially in a context of poverty or in post-conflicts settings. This experience triggered my commitment to helping refugees in their host countries to keep living, learning, evolving, so that when the day comes and they can finally go home, they are better equipped to face the huge challenges awaiting them.”

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>During the summer of 2014, I had this amazing opportunity to visit Cape Town, South Africa for the first time. My sister and I decided to  volunteer at the Desmond Tutu HIV AIDS Youth Center.  Before we went there, I  didn't quite know what to expect or what exactly we were supposed to be doing. The first couple of days were bit awkward as we were new, from another country and did not know the youth/kids and the staff that were there. We did many odd jobs around the center; we helped out in the technology room, the vegetable garden, and kitchen. But my favorite part of the day was that once the work was finished, I got to play soccer with all the kids for hours together! They loved the game and played with no shoes or gear in the dirt courtyard with a big smile on their faces.  The kids at the Center were from HIV AIDS affected families from the Masiphumelele Township, a shanty town next door.  They all came from very poor families. The effects of the disease was all around us, and it was very sad. But you would never guess that if you met these kids. In spite of their circumstances, these were some of the happiest kids I have ever met. It made me realize how much I had to be thankful for, living in USA and the environment  I was growing up in and everything I had.  Even though the kids and I were from completely different worlds, the one thing we had in common was our passion for soccer!!  Soccer instantly ""connected"" me to the kids, and we became friends!  As I was finishing my volunteer project, I gave my green soccer ball to the kids. Just that one simple act made the kids so ecstatic and happy. It really touched me. I decided I need to do more for them.  They deserve so much more than what they have. I am going back this summer to volunteer there, and I want take funds to buy soccer balls and gear for all of them! So I need to raise funds!<br/></p>
<p><b>Please watch the video above, and I would be very thankful if you could support me </b></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>There are close to about 100 kids that the Youth Center supports. My goal is to get each one a pair of soccer shoes (cleats), socks and clothes. The cost is approximately $ 100 per kid. So 100 x $100.00 is about $10,000.  Any funds left over will be used to buy balls and soccer equipment.  <b>My goal is to raise $10K for this initiative.</b></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>These kids don't have much going for them.

</div></div>","Short Summary During the summer of 2014, I had this amazing opportunity to visit Cape Town, South Africa for the first time. My sister and I decided to  volunteer at the Desmond Tutu HIV AIDS Youth Center.  Before we went there, I  didn't quite know what to expect or what exactly we were supposed to be doing. The first couple of days were bit awkward as we were new, from another country and did not know the youth/kids and the staff that were there. We did many odd jobs around the center; we helped out in the technology room, the vegetable garden, and kitchen. But my favorite part of the day was that once the work was finished, I got to play soccer with all the kids for hours together! They loved the game and played with no shoes or gear in the dirt courtyard with a big smile on their faces.  The kids at the Center were from HIV AIDS affected families from the Masiphumelele Township, a shanty town next door.  They all came from very poor families. The effects of the disease was all around us, and it was very sad. But you would never guess that if you met these kids. In spite of their circumstances, these were some of the happiest kids I have ever met. It made me realize how much I had to be thankful for, living in USA and the environment  I was growing up in and everything I had.  Even though the kids and I were from completely different worlds, the one thing we had in common was our passion for soccer!!  Soccer instantly ""connected"" me to the kids, and we became friends!  As I was finishing my volunteer project, I gave my green soccer ball to the kids. Just that one simple act made the kids so ecstatic and happy. It really touched me. I decided I need to do more for them.  They deserve so much more than what they have. I am going back this summer to volunteer there, and I want take funds to buy soccer balls and gear for all of them! So I need to raise funds!
Please watch the video above, and I would be very thankful if you could support me    What We Need There are close to about 100 kids that the Youth Center supports. My goal is to get each one a pair of soccer shoes (cleats), socks and clothes. The cost is approximately $ 100 per kid. So 100 x $100.00 is about $10,000.  Any funds left over will be used to buy balls and soccer equipment.  My goal is to raise $10K for this initiative.   The Impact These kids don't have much going for them. The Youth Center is one place where they come to play and spend some time being happy in an otherwise depressing environment. If a simple soccer ball could lift their spirits, imagine what some spanking new soccer gear will do for them! 
I wish I could offer some incentives for your contributions, but that would only take away from what I can give these kids. 

    Other Ways You Can Help I sincerely hope to achieve my fund raising goal of 11K (including costs and fees). If I'm able to raise more than that, I'd like to convert their gravel patch into a usable soccer field. So please continue to donate even if the initial target has been reached. 
Thank you very much!

Mission

The Maama Omwana Project strives to improve the well-being of mothers and infants in Uganda through culturally appropriate eduactional programs. We imagine a world where mothers are educated, supported, empowered and able to give birth feeling confident and informed.
Values

Through collaborative work with women in Uganda, we share a core value of relationship building. Our work and relationships are longstanding and deeply rooted at the community level. We value the importance of working in coalition with women in order to be successful in our mission.
History

Maama Omwana began with a vision to promote prenatal education as a tool for improving maternal and infant health in Uganda and has evolved into a collaborative community based program that promotes informed birth for the well-being of families, women's rights, and HIV awareness. Founded by Sarah Van Wyck, a birth and postpartum doula, gender studies major at the University of British Columbia, and passionate women's rights advocate, our first program began in 2014.
After a trip to Uganda in 2014 volunteering as a prenatal educator and doula, Sarah connected with a local organization who played a key role in organizing over 200 women to learn. She met some amazing people who were passionate about building their community and who invited her to organize a continual program for mothers and infants.   Our Program - Maama Class Uganda

Maama Class Uganda is an initiative to connect childbearing women in Uganda through education. Through the employment of a local Ugandan prenatal educator, Maama Class Uganda offers a culturally appropriate avenue to learning prenatal education, education on women’s rights, HIV education, partner communication, and family planning techniques.
Why is Prenatal Education Important?

Access to maternal health in Uganda is limited. Government hospitals are overcrowded and private clinics are costly. Prenatal education is important because it gives women the education they need to make informed decisions about their preganany, birth, postpartum, and their overall health.
What is a Maama Birthing Kit and why are they important?

A Maama Kit  provides a lifeline for some mothers. Some hospitals and clinics have little resources for women giving birth; if we can equip women and their care providers with the most basic tools for infant delivery, it could significantly change the outcome of her birth.
According to PACE Uganda, A CDK (Clean Delivery Kit) provides the necessary tools and instructions to achieve the World Health Organization's ""Five Cleans"" throughout the birthing process and reduce maternal and child mortality. It can help to prevent infections and death of the mother and baby by preventing tetanus, sepsis, HIV, infant eye infection.
A CDK contains; a plastic sheet, soap, 2 pairs of surgical gloves, cotton wool, cord ties, a surgical blade and a new child growth and postnatal card.
What are Cycle Beads and why are they important?

Cycle Beads are a form of family planning that is acceptable to women whose faith does not permit medical contraceptives. They are also important for women who have limited access to medical care and prescriptions. They are a tool that gives women the education and the opportunity to plan their reproductive lives.

 The Well-Trained Mind Montessori</h3>
<p>My name is Jason Bruni and I am passionate about a lot of things but making sure children have the best education tops my list. Part of ensuring a child gets a good education is making sure the school they are at has the necessary tools to do so.</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>   While teachers are the biggest part of the equation, office equipment like desks, chairs, pencils, paper and especially a reliable office printer are key to success. Recently, I found out that the Montessori a friend of mine works at does not have a printer they can afford to use. This is an issue because of how the school operates. <br/></p>
<p>       The Well-Trained Mind Montessori consists of two educators and 30 students. They have a garden, pets (such as chickens), and tech/prepaid kids for more than just reading textbooks in the next grade; they help prepare them for real life. Believe it or not, it's a lot harder to help provide a good education without a working printer. It's very doable, don't get me wrong, but it requires the teachers to use their library area and the cards of all their friends (my friend asked for Christmas to have people donate their printing at the library so she could have packets to give the kids) to make it happen. I would like to believe I'm not the only one who finds that to be ridiculous....that's where you come in.</p>
</div><div> <p> </p>
<p>        I have found a printer that would work perfect for the school. It's a Xerox WorkCenter 6400x Color multifunction Printer. I'm sure you can tell by the name it isn't cheap, you're right. It costs $4400...yeah, that's expensive. Here is the thing though, the toner cartridges can print 44,000 pages before they are done and it costs $73 for a new 2-pack. What that means is a crazy low cost for the school to print from here on out! Every dollar raised over the total printer cost will be used to purchase extra supplies for the printer. If we exceed the $5k mark, the funds will go to other betterment projects for the school. This is a very achievable goal. If 500 people donated $10, we are there. $10 doesn't go very far these days. You can get a coffee and pastry from Starbucks, with current gas prices you could get 5-6 gallons of gas, or you could make a difference for a child.<br/></p>
<p>        A Well -Trained Mind hasn't increased the cost to go to school there in years because it matters more to them to make sure everyone can go there who wants than it  does to make a profit. This Montessori is on the precipice of greatness, join me in helping them cross that line by making a donation today towards their new printer.</p>

<p>We offer
<b>complete transparency</b> regarding all matters and operations within the company.
These are not just words. Our sponsors can participate in the ""<b>Privy
Councilor""</b> campaign, in which they become <i><b>our consulting agents</b></i>. Anyone
can sign up for this campaign for $25 and become our Privy Councilor. Once a
week, you will receive a letter with a detailed report on all company
operations. The only condition, besides the $25 contribution, is your
willingness to participate. We will keep you posted on all company matters and
in return, we would like you to share your opinion regarding everything we tell
you. Some information, appearing in our reports, will be marked as
'confidential'. It means that it's not intended to be shared with the general
public. We totally rely on your common sense regarding the matter of publishing
our company-related information.  The thing is - we're not naive, we just
have trust in human awareness.</p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;""></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">As you understand we know
a thing or two about advertising, public relations, trade secrets and
significance of avoiding prior disclosure.</p>
<p>But
nevertheless, we are willing to take that chance, and for a good reason. The
first reason is that we never had and currently don't have the funds required
to run a full media campaign ""promoting the product and the idea"". It
means that people don't have too many chances to learn about us. So, when we
take this step, we are striving to solve this problem, at least partially.</p>
<p>The
second aspect: our project is software-related. We don't have any newfangled
gadgets you can show your friends and brag about , but we  do  have a
Demo-Version, fighting spirit, a will to win and passion for implementing the
i-Skool vision. <b>No crowdfunding project has offered such degree of
openness as we do</b>. No one has dared to operate on this level until now. At
least, we haven't encountered any project that would dare to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The third aspect: we believe that for many parents, it is
important to understand what and how their children are being taught. For all
those interested, this is a great opportunity to find out in detail how
educational projects really work, providing our children with an ability to study
at home without school teachers and daily class routine. Most importantly, you
will be able to make an impact, rather than being a bystander!</p>
<p>We have
less than a month remaining to raise $15000. It can be done. We ask you to
help us raise this amount of money. This is a request for helping us, this is
not a demand. We will respect your choice, whatever it may be. Being completely
honest, it is clear that we have the right to ask and you have the right to
refuse. Everyone should act according to the willingness of taking a part in
anything.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One last
thing. This project, like many others, is aimed to make the world a better
place. There are bunch of good projects that pursue similar goals. Let's
support each other. Contact us, we will be happy to collaborate! The potential
of any project depends on communication between the project owner and
like-minded people.</p>

</div></div>","i-Skool is a technology aimed at improving learning abilities by creating thinking tasks which correlates to physical activities. Based on current research, it has been proven that thinking, memorizing  and practicing cognitive skills while moving, enhances brain activity which leads to better learning. The product functions as an alternative and as a physical method for educating and   testing of students. The software will be distributed worldwide via UNESCO to        school districts, teachers and parents.  This will allow these people to design        education content that is specific for their communities. All of this content will be    stored and made available for others to use. I-Skool has started to create learning    templates which will be made available to all.i-Skool is a platform
based mobile learning solution enabling children and students from all over the
world to enjoy an innovative and accessible educational learning system.
 i-Skool allows parents and teachers to design the Learning Materials and Content and to set goals, interaction levels and incentives.

i-Skool improves learning abilities by creating thinking tasks for all students from Kindergarten to College.

Our perks
Start  your  free  trial !






 
We offer
complete transparency regarding all matters and operations within the company.
These are not just words. Our sponsors can participate in the ""Privy
Councilor"" campaign, in which they become our consulting agents. Anyone
can sign up for this campaign for $25 and become our Privy Councilor. Once a
week, you will receive a letter with a detailed report on all company
operations. The only condition, besides the $25 contribution, is your
willingness to participate. We will keep you posted on all company matters and
in return, we would like you to share your opinion regarding everything we tell
you. Some information, appearing in our reports, will be marked as
'confidential'. It means that it's not intended to be shared with the general
public. We totally rely on your common sense regarding the matter of publishing
our company-related information.  The thing is - we're not naive, we just
have trust in human awareness.



As you understand we know
a thing or two about advertising, public relations, trade secrets and
significance of avoiding prior disclosure.
But
nevertheless, we are willing to take that chance, and for a good reason. The
first reason is that we never had and currently don't have the funds required
to run a full media campaign ""promoting the product and the idea"". It
means that people don't have too many chances to learn about us. So, when we
take this step, we are striving to solve this problem, at least partially.
The
second aspect: our project is software-related. We don't have any newfangled
gadgets you can show your friends and brag about , but we  do  have a
Demo-Version, fighting spirit, a will to win and passion for implementing the
i-Skool vision. No crowdfunding project has offered such degree of
openness as we do. No one has dared to operate on this level until now. At
least, we haven't encountered any project that would dare to do so.



The third aspect: we believe that for many parents, it is
important to understand what and how their children are being taught. For all
those interested, this is a great opportunity to find out in detail how
educational projects really work, providing our children with an ability to study
at home without school teachers and daily class routine. Most importantly, you
will be able to make an impact, rather than being a bystander!
We have
less than a month remaining to raise $15000. It can be done. We ask you to
help us raise this amount of money. This is a request for helping us, this is
not a demand. We will respect your choice, whatever it may be. Being completely
honest, it is clear that we have the right to ask and you have the right to
refuse. Everyone should act according to the willingness of taking a part in
anything.

One last
thing. This project, like many others, is aimed to make the world a better
place. There are bunch of good projects that pursue similar goals. Let's
support each other. Contact us, we will be happy to collaborate! The potential
of any project depends on communication between the project owner and
like-minded people.














         

               
Generation Y technology adoption to Mobile Learning (M-Learning) is a very impressive .The education
system must go hand-in-hand with this trend. M-Learning provides students high levels of engagement while it can be adjusted to each students’ needs in terms of time, place and educational level.
In addition, M-Learning provides some unique interaction features including visual and audible capabilities,
competition and teamwork.
Just the facts:
More then thirty-nine percent (39%) of all US educational organizations are already
using some form of M-Learning. M-Learning’s annual growth rate is a most impressive twenty-nine percent (29.3%).
M-Learning is accessible 24/7/365 worldwide. M-Learning is 100% intuitive, encouraging
collaboration with other students and interaction with teachers and mentors.
M-Learning is highly cost-effective in terms of time,
content and Return on Investment (ROI).The game play concept is simple - each action taken in the   test  is "" mapped"" or assigned to an image - recogized visual code (image,shape or color).The visual codes are scattered at physical locations,some of which may be simply colored paper hung on walls, or colors of a specific person's shirt, images (or QR codes), placed or hidden in the classroom or exterior space.Each player will hold a mobile device and will receive instructions from the application. This include: task's content, possible answers/ actions, and information regarding the visual code (i.e.mapping each answer to a certain color).The nature of the task will be given to the student to instruct him to walk or run from code loaction to code location, in order to complete the given task. There might be a time limit for completing a task, or all of the tasks.The location of the codes to one another, and their quantity, will ensure the answers adds up to a certain specific amount and that each student has completed the physical session.The question types will include be Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) or Match and Collect.The game can be played by single players or as a group which collaborates to solve the questions or in a competitive mode between players or groups.Content creators will be free to use any topic they want to teach,  using pre-existing exercise or use any of the templates that i-Skool will create for tasks for their students. This will be done as a part of what we call the back office tool.In addition the playing field will need to be set by the content creators, with mapping the visual codes that are around (or they will create new ones) to the database of tasks.Start  your  free  trial !              VIDEO INSTRUCTION             _____________________________________________________________________________The application will be divided into two parts: 
1. Game – The game itself,which the players will see.

<p><b>""A healthy mind in a healthy body""</b><br/>For 10 years now our school has been giving keys to develop a more 
balanced and harmonious lifestyle. It is essential for kids, teenagers 
and also adults in our society! <br/></p>
<p>We propose a health practice as well as a martial one. They have a 
common basis : to learn to correctly inhabit one's body (rooting, 
breathing, postures, relaxation), to recover a real fluidity in motion 
and know one's energy to channel it. The practice allows one to discover
 oneself and develop some skills (concentration, calm, 
self-confidence...)<br/>

<h3>Nos besoins / What We Need<br/>
</h3>
<h3>
</h3>Nous avons trouvé un entrepôt de 200 m2 à louer. Il existe déjà deux pièces pour le Shiatsu et un sanitaire. Maintenant, pour pouvoir commencer notre activité nous avons besoin de 12 000 € pour construire un plancher de 100 m2. Le plancher sera en pin et aura le motif du Tao peint en son centre afin de travailler les marches du Bagua dessus. C'est la première étape !<br/>
<p>Ensuite, nous aurons encore deux étapes pour finir les aménagements du Dojo : <br/></p>
<ol>
<li>Créer deux vestiaires (hommes et femmes), une douche, un deuxième sanitaire et équiper la salle (extincteurs, sac de frappe, etc.) <br/>
</li>
<li>Puis il restera à installer avant l'hiver prochain des chauffages (au gaz) et un bureau pour la gestion administrative du Dojo<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p><b>La totalité des travaux est estimée à 40 000 €.</b> <br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>We found a 200m² warehouse to rent. There are already two rooms for 
Shiatsu and a toilet room. Now, to be able to start our activity we need
 12 000€ to set a wooden floor on 100m². The floor will be made with 
pine wood and will have a Tao drawn on its center, to help practice bagua walks on it. It's the first step !</p>
<p>Then we will have another two steps to complete the Dojo's makeover :<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Create two locker rooms (men and women), a shower, a second room for 
toilets, and equip the warehouse (fire extinguishers, punch-bags, ...)</li>
<li>Finally, before next winter, install gas heating and a desk for the Dojo's management and administration<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<b><b>The total amount for all the makeover is estimated at 40 000€.</b></b><br/><br/><br/>

Créer un Dojo d'arts martiaux internes à Loos, près de Lille (Nord de la France). Un Dojo est un lieu pour ""trouver sa propre voie, l'étudier et la pratiquer"". De manière originale, notre école réunira dans un même centre :

des cours et des stages de Kung-Fu Bagua Zhang, Xing Yi Quan, Qi Gong, Tai Ji Quan et Dao Yin

des séances et ateliers de Shiatsu (technique de thérapie manuelle et énergétique japonaise)
des stages pluridisciplinaires (calligraphie chinoise, yoga, etc.)
une bibliothèque de livres sur les arts énergétiques et martiaux
des conférences sur le Shiatsu, le Feng Shui, les médecines naturelles, etc.
des rencontres autour d'initiatives alternatives favorisant le respect de la Nature, de l'être humain et de sa santé





Create a martial arts Dojo in Loos, near Lille (north of France). A
 Dojo is a place to ""find one's own path, study it and practice it"". In 
an original way, our school will combine in the same place :



Classes and workshops about Kung-Fu Bagua Zhang, Xing Yi Quan, Qi Gong, Tai Ji Quan and Dao Yin

Shiatsu sessions and workshop (hand and energetic japanese technique)

Multidisciplinary workshops (chinese calligraphy, yoga...)
A library of books about energetic and martial arts
Conferences about Shiatsu, Feng Shui, natural medicines...
Meetings to discuss alternative initiatives about respecting human beings, their health, and nature





Notre but / Our goal

""Un esprit sain dans un corps sain"" ! 
Depuis 10 ans, notre école donne des clés pour développer un mode de vie plus équilibré et plus harmonieux. C'est essentiel pour les enfants, les jeunes et aussi pour les adultes dans la société actuelle !
Nous proposons une pratique de santé et/ou une pratique martiale. La base est commune : apprendre à habiter correctement son corps (ancrage, respiration, postures, détente), à retrouver une vraie souplesse dans le mouvement et à connaître son énergie pour la canaliser. La pratique permet de se découvrir et de développer certaines qualités (concentration, calme, confiance en soi, etc.).

However, many children with disabilities do not have access or resources for these types of vital programs that could positively impact their early development.  Aside from Lighthouse Learning Center's structured, specialized curriculum, the facility is also home to on-site therapy services (physical, occupational and speech pathology), nursing assistance and support services.  Helping us bring in a developmentally-appropriate physical education program will allow us to provide a fully-integrated educational construct.   Other Ways You Can Help We understand that help comes in all forms.  If you are unable to make a monetary donation to our campaign, you can still help our children succeed! You can:  Share our campaign on your social media platforms - knowledge is power! Enlist the help of your church, community, or civic groups to raise funds and awareness.

</div></div>","MarbleJam Kids is raising money to offer children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) and their families within Northern New Jersey the opportunity to participate in our creative arts therapy programs. OUR STORY
            

It is inevitable that you have learned more about the growing number of children and families affected by the challenges of autism. Here in our New Jersey communities the number of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) has risen to 1 in 45, 1 in 28 boys, which creates the likelihood that most of you have knowledge firsthand of the needs of these children and their families.





As mothers of children with ASDs, we founded MarbleJam Kids, a 501c3 nonprofit organization, as a call to action to provide responsible arts programming to children with Autism.  Established in 2007, the organization started with one signature after school arts program specifically designed for children with autism.

Our collaborative approach enables learners to define and express themselves with total communicative competency. Our multi-prism curriculum addresses the following:</p><ul>
<li>academic preparedness </li>
<li>professional growth</li>
<li>social engagement</li>
<li>cultural enrichment</li>
</ul><div>Right now we're fundraising to get our mission started! We are a group of passionate, experienced teachers who have been working tirelessly to create a challenging, dynamic curriculum that focuses on the needs of our students. Our first endeavor will be a low-cost summer camp that helps prepare international students for the American college experience. We will focus on immersive, cultural experiences that help students develop language competency and self-confidence before entering an American college classroom. <p></p>
</div><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>What are we fundraising for? </p><ul>
<li>
<b>A space!</b> We're looking for a space to hold our camp. We're hoping to raise enough funds to book spaces that match the themes of our camp weeks. For example, for our film week, we're hoping to rent out a cinema and for our nature and conservation week, we're looking to get a covered space in one of Portland's beautiful parks. </li>
<li>
<b>Outings!</b> We believe that cultural experiences are a great way for students to learn and use language. Over our 4-week camp, we will take our students on trips to Portland cultural sights, nature hikes, and cultural/artistic excursions. Your donation will help defer costs of these outings. </li>
<li>
<b>Materials! </b>No classroom is complete without classroom materials. These funds will help pay for the costs of books, videos, papers, and other classroom materials. </li>
<li>
<b>Overhead!</b> No one likes to think of charitable organizations needing overhead, but the truth is, they do. We'd love all of our money to go to our program, but as a new school, we have a few startup costs that need to be taken care of. First and foremost, we're in the process of applying for non-profit status and will be using some of these funds to pay for that application. </li>
<li>
<b>Future Funding!</b> Anything that we make over our goal will go towards funding future Logos Language projects. </li>
</ul><div>What do you get for helping us? <p></p>
<ul>
<li>Other than the knowledge of helping high school seniors from around the world facilitate their dreams of studying abroad and helping us towards our future mission....</li>
<li>Take a look on the side to see what you get for your donation! </li>
</ul>
</div><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>With more and more international students coming to American universities every year, the need for collegiate preparation courses is undeniable. All of us here on staff have worked in pre-university ESL programs and found that cultural adjustment can be incredibly difficult for new students. We want to help remove some of the anxiety that comes with studying abroad. We will teach students critical skills including: </p><ul>
<li>the culture of the American college classroom</li>
<li>American culture norms </li>
<li>socialization skills</li>
<li>study habits </li>
<li>English language training</li>
</ul><div>Long term, we're looking to make a larger community impact. The two branches we've seen in the ESL community are academic ESL programs and community ESL programs. In our experience, academic programs are generally for-profit and focus on meeting the needs of university-bound international students. Community programs generally target lower level students.

</ul><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div>","Who We AreWe believe that ESL education should be student-oriented and not for profit. Logos Language Center is an adult education organization dedicated to providing language learners with affordable, holistic language instruction through an innovative cultural lens. Our collaborative approach enables learners to define and express themselves with total communicative competency. Our multi-prism curriculum addresses the following:
academic preparedness 
professional growth
social engagement
cultural enrichment
Right now we're fundraising to get our mission started! We are a group of passionate, experienced teachers who have been working tirelessly to create a challenging, dynamic curriculum that focuses on the needs of our students. Our first endeavor will be a low-cost summer camp that helps prepare international students for the American college experience. We will focus on immersive, cultural experiences that help students develop language competency and self-confidence before entering an American college classroom. 
What We Need & What You GetWhat are we fundraising for? 

A space! We're looking for a space to hold our camp. We're hoping to raise enough funds to book spaces that match the themes of our camp weeks. For example, for our film week, we're hoping to rent out a cinema and for our nature and conservation week, we're looking to get a covered space in one of Portland's beautiful parks. 

Outings! We believe that cultural experiences are a great way for students to learn and use language. Over our 4-week camp, we will take our students on trips to Portland cultural sights, nature hikes, and cultural/artistic excursions. Your donation will help defer costs of these outings. 

Materials! No classroom is complete without classroom materials. These funds will help pay for the costs of books, videos, papers, and other classroom materials. 

Overhead! No one likes to think of charitable organizations needing overhead, but the truth is, they do. We'd love all of our money to go to our program, but as a new school, we have a few startup costs that need to be taken care of. First and foremost, we're in the process of applying for non-profit status and will be using some of these funds to pay for that application. 

Future Funding! Anything that we make over our goal will go towards funding future Logos Language projects. 
What do you get for helping us? 

Other than the knowledge of helping high school seniors from around the world facilitate their dreams of studying abroad and helping us towards our future mission....
Take a look on the side to see what you get for your donation! 

The ImpactWith more and more international students coming to American universities every year, the need for collegiate preparation courses is undeniable. All of us here on staff have worked in pre-university ESL programs and found that cultural adjustment can be incredibly difficult for new students. We want to help remove some of the anxiety that comes with studying abroad. We will teach students critical skills including: 
the culture of the American college classroom
American culture norms 
socialization skills
study habits 
English language training
Long term, we're looking to make a larger community impact. The two branches we've seen in the ESL community are academic ESL programs and community ESL programs. In our experience, academic programs are generally for-profit and focus on meeting the needs of university-bound international students. Community programs generally target lower level students. We want to fill the void in the market. We hope to provide challenging ESL classes to local students at all levels. We hope to schedule our classes to meet the needs of working professionals in the Portland metro area. Our curriculum will be focused on meeting their needs. Risks & ChallengesWe are experienced teachers who are embarking on a brand new endeavor. There will undoubtedly be bumps and challenges along the way, but our communal approach will help us through them. We approach all situations from a collaborative approach. Not only our board, but our students and volunteer staff will have a voice in the decisions made for the school. We greatly appreciate any and all feedback and will use each challenge as an opportunity for growth. Other Ways You Can HelpMoney is not the only way to help!

<h3>Why Girls Education! </h3>
<p>Girls' Post Primary Education is the most effective and sustainable way to deal with poverty. More education means lesser chances of child marriage. If a girl is allowed to grow up into a mature and educated person, she would be better able to manage her family and take care of her children.

The next generation would be better off than the previous one. </p>

I have tried my best to help as many people individually as possible.

Why Girls Education! 
Girls' Post Primary Education is the most effective and sustainable way to deal with poverty. More education means lesser chances of child marriage. If a girl is allowed to grow up into a mature and educated person, she would be better able to manage her family and take care of her children.

What We Need 
 The mathematics of girls education is simple. The cost of sending one girl to school for one year is US $ 240. It includes her traveling, uniform and shoes. The books are provided free of cost by the government, while tuition fee is nominal,and usually parents can afford that. 
Sending 1 girl to school for 1 year: GBP 156

Total: 78,000 + 20,000 = GBP 98,000 
 *Administrative Cost: It included the cost incurred by Bedari for managing the project. We need to hire at least one female who registers girls, and monitors their progress. She makes sure that the poorest of the poor girls get benefit from our program, they remain in school, and are performing well. 
If we do not reach our goal, the funds collected would be handed over to Bedari to add benefits for the girls already studying under this project. These benefits include study tours, and awareness sessions on women rights. 
Risks & Challenges
 As we are already running this project for several  years, there is little that can go wrong. Families usually do not like to get charity, so we have already pitched this project as a scholarship program. A girl has to have at least primary education to qualify for the scholarship to study in the secondary school in the nearby town. 
Please note that primary school exists in almost every village, and girls do attend primary school as it does not involve traveling to another town/village.

                      <<   Previous events outcomes and success? >>



From the previous turban day events we reached an audience at each event of 1,000+ individuals who not only had turbans tied on but were taught the meaning behind Sikhism at the International Fountain!
Through social media platforms many participants showed support for this event re-tweeted, posted pictures and offered thanks for hosting such an educational event!

We have return attendees from previous years that come out and show support and say thanks.

تاریخی آبادان در بستر تاریخ جهان است. پروژه کاملا غیر انتفاعی می باشد و تا به
حال یک پشتوانه مالی 13000 هزاردلاری از موسسه خیریه دانمارکی «بنیاد ایرانشناسی
آرتور کریستنسن» دریافت کرده ام. در این مرحله، به 10000 دلار دیگر احتیاج دارم تا
بخش عمومی این پروژه را راه اندازی کنم.</p>
<p>گروهی از محققین مجرب را از سراسر جهان دست چین
کرده ام تا در مورد آبادان تحقیق کنند و مقاله بنویسند، گیتاشناس و متخصص GIS
انتخاب کرده ام که نقشه ها را بسازند، و طراح وبی که بتواند پایانه کارآمادی را
بسازد. در کنار این، هنرمندانی را هم یافته ام که بتوانند قطعات هنری زیبایی
بسازند و آبادان را دوباره زنده کند. هدف نهایی ام این است که چارچوبی را که از
طریق پروژه «بازگویی آبادان» ساخته می شود بطور رایگان در دسترس عموم بگذارم تا
بتواند از آن برای بازگویی داستان شهرهای دیگر نیز استفاده کنند.</p>
<p>بخش اولیه پشتوانه مالی دریافت شده برای برقراری
امکان تحقیق در بریتانیا، امریکا، سوییس، و ایران در نظر گرفته شده است. یک
سخنرانی و یک سمینار در مورد تاریخ آبادان (در دانمارک و ایالات متحده)، خرج های
اولیه پایگاه وب، و بخشی از خرج چاپ یک کتاب در مورد آبادان نیز بخشی از این

بازگویی آبادان بخشی از یک پروژه گسترده تر است برای مستندسازی
تاریخی آبادان در بستر تاریخ جهان است. پروژه کاملا غیر انتفاعی می باشد و تا به
حال یک پشتوانه مالی 13000 هزاردلاری از موسسه خیریه دانمارکی «بنیاد ایرانشناسی
آرتور کریستنسن» دریافت کرده ام. در این مرحله، به 10000 دلار دیگر احتیاج دارم تا
بخش عمومی این پروژه را راه اندازی کنم.
گروهی از محققین مجرب را از سراسر جهان دست چین
کرده ام تا در مورد آبادان تحقیق کنند و مقاله بنویسند، گیتاشناس و متخصص GIS
انتخاب کرده ام که نقشه ها را بسازند، و طراح وبی که بتواند پایانه کارآمادی را
بسازد. در کنار این، هنرمندانی را هم یافته ام که بتوانند قطعات هنری زیبایی
بسازند و آبادان را دوباره زنده کند. هدف نهایی ام این است که چارچوبی را که از
طریق پروژه «بازگویی آبادان» ساخته می شود بطور رایگان در دسترس عموم بگذارم تا
بتواند از آن برای بازگویی داستان شهرهای دیگر نیز استفاده کنند.
بخش اولیه پشتوانه مالی دریافت شده برای برقراری
امکان تحقیق در بریتانیا، امریکا، سوییس، و ایران در نظر گرفته شده است. یک
سخنرانی و یک سمینار در مورد تاریخ آبادان (در دانمارک و ایالات متحده)، خرج های
اولیه پایگاه وب، و بخشی از خرج چاپ یک کتاب در مورد آبادان نیز بخشی از این
پشتوانه است.
10000 


دلار آخری
خرج موارد زیر خواهد شد-دستمزد پرداختی به محققان برای مقالات تحقیقی (حدود 15
مقاله): 3000 دلار
-طراحی بانک اطلاعاتی ویکی و نقشه ها (شامل وسایل فنی،
تصویر برداری از مدارک اصلی و غیره): 4000 دلار
-طراحی قطعات هنری برای پایگاه وب و برای استفاده های دیگر:
3000 دلار
تمام هزینه های کمکی مستقیما به حساب پروژه در
دانشگاه کپنهاگ واریز خواهد شد.
  
به عنوان بخشی از قسمت دوم پروژه، من در حال
طراحی یک کتاب زیبا به همراه عکس هایی با کیفیت بالا، نقشه های بزرگ و کامل، آثار
هنری، و مقالاتی در مورد آبادان هستم و همچنین نمایشگاهی را پایه گذاری خواهم کرد
که امیدوارم در تمام اروپا، ایالات متحده، و ایران به نمایش درآید. جزویات بیشتر
به زودی منتشر خواهند شد.
اما در حال حاضر، امیدوارم که شما به پروژه کمک
کنید و این درخواست را با شبکه های اجتماعی خود به اشتراک بگذارید تا بتوانیم همه
با هم، آبادان را بازگویی کنیم

The facts</strong>:
<br/>Before I start digging into what BuyMyLemonade.com is all about, there are three facts I wish to highlight.
<br/><br/><strong>1.</strong>	The average North American K-12 student possesses between $300 and $1,500 worth of <strong>inventory</strong> such as <strong>toys, games, book, electronics</strong> etc… that they no longer use. These are packed in boxes, under beds, or in basements and will most likely end up in a <strong>landfill</strong>. </p><p><strong>2.</strong>	Fundraising is <strong>inevitable</strong> and has become an <strong>integral</strong> part of our kids’ school and after-school activities. There are many ways kids can fundraise; most of them involve large <strong>investments</strong> of time and money.</p><p><strong>3.</strong>	Although our kids are acting like <strong>business people</strong> selling products to strangers and generating revenues (<strong>entrepreneurship 101</strong>), they have never been treated as entrepreneurs or small business owners but only as foot <strong>soldiers</strong> – their entire job is to smile at the door. The current fundraising activities have <strong>zero to little educational value</strong>.
</p><p><strong>About the founders</strong>:
<br/>Isaac and I possess more than <strong>20 years</strong> of entrepreneurship experience <strong>each</strong> and we have both founded and managed several successful businesses in the past.

For the last year we invested our money and time to develop <strong>BuyMyLemonade.com</strong> and we are very excited to share it with the world. 
Both Isaac and I are parents to kids aged 2, 7, 9, 10, and 13, so you can only imagine how many of their fundraising campaigns we had to participate in the last 6 or 7 years.</p><p><strong>
The solution: <br/></strong>
BuyMyLemonade.com was founded and designed based on the <strong>deep frustration</strong> we experienced with traditional fundraising activities. We have developed a revolutionary fundraising business model that simply <strong>solves the three issues</strong> I mentioned above (and more).
 </p><p>We built a platform that <strong>integrates</strong> e-commerce and e-learning capabilities which means that our platform will <strong>help</strong> you, your students and your organization to:
<br/><br/><strong>1.</strong>	Better fundraise by <strong>monetizing</strong> an overwhelming amount of inventory found under your young fundraisers’ beds and in their basements. You will <strong>no longer</strong> have the need to invest upfront cash buying products made by third-party suppliers and you will <strong>no longer lose 50%</strong> of your revenue. 
<br/><br/><strong>2.	</strong>Allow your students to fundraise from the <strong>comfort of their home</strong> and turn their own pre-loved or un-used inventory of items into cash right from their <strong>desktops, tablets and cell phones</strong>. You will keep them and their parents away from <strong>pounding the pavement</strong> or driving around the neighbourhood for door-to-door sales. 
<br/><br/><strong>3.</strong>	Provide your K-12 students the ability to <strong>learn key real-world business skills</strong> through the entire fundraising process: <br/>
    - online sales and marketing <br/>
    - entrepreneurship and financial literacy
<br/>   - creative thinking and social responsibility
</p><p>Through our entire fundraising process, students of all ages are <strong>empowered</strong> to: </p><p> 
- Choose which products to sell and to whom,
<br/>  - Learn how to set their own fair prices
<br/>   - Learn how to safely market their items over social media channels, <br/> 
  - Learn how to sell (using sales techniques, setting discounts, and more), and
<br/>   - Learn how to pack and ship items to buyers.
</p><p>
In other words, BuyMylemonade.com gives students a real<strong>-life business experience</strong> where they basically <strong>run their own small online business</strong> while their sales proceeds are forwarded to their social fundraising campaigns.
</p><p>From a social responsibility perspective, we provide a user-friendly ecosystem where children of all ages <strong>can be socially responsible citizens</strong> by donating their possessions and their sales proceeds to their preferred fundraising campaign.
</p><p>
BML provides full access to parents and teachers so they can supervise all activity on the site. </p><p><strong>
Our mission:
<br/></strong>At the end of the day, our overall mission is to turn 44 million <strong>K-12</strong> students into 44 million <strong>young entrepreneurs</strong>. Can you imagine the <strong>long-term effect</strong> on our <strong>economy</strong> if these students can be inspired by the experience of real <strong>entrepreneurship at a young age</strong>? </p><p><strong>
KPIs (key performance indicators):
<br/></strong>We built a platform that provides <strong>measurable, positive social impact</strong> for all of our users, clients, investors, and shareholders. BML's <strong>""for-purpose""</strong> approach blends a <strong>for-profit business model</strong> with an <strong>educational directive</strong> and a charitable intention. </p><p><strong>
Your support is needed:
<br/></strong>We have just launched our platform, so please use it; however, we do need your <strong>funding support</strong> so we can add more i<strong>nstructional videos and develop more educational features. </strong>We want to turn our platform into an optimal <strong>educational and fundraising tool</strong> for every school, sports team and youth organization.</p><p><strong>
Why are we crowdfunding?
<br/></strong>We decided to <strong>raise money through a crowdfunding campaign</strong> because we strongly believe that our solution should be supported by its <strong>users</strong> and not by bankers. The product was built for educators, students and youth-related organizations and as such, it needs to be supported by them through donation and/or participation. </p><p><strong>
What we need the money for:
<br/></strong>85% of the funds raised will be invested in developing more <strong>instructional videos and educational features,</strong> and in hiring the staff we desperately need to grow our company and improve our user experience. The other 15% will allow us to attend <strong>educational conferences</strong> and summits so we can learn <strong>from you </strong>and other educators what else we can do in order to improve your fundraising experience with us.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>
Your support again:
<br/></strong>Whether you decide to support us <strong>financially</strong> or not we would love to <strong>have you as a customer.</strong> Donations of any size are appreciated, but we would really love it if you would <strong>spread the word</strong> about this campaign and our platform. </p><p>

The product was built for educators, students and youth-related organizations and as such, it needs to be supported by them through donation and/or participation. 
What we need the money for:
85% of the funds raised will be invested in developing more instructional videos and educational features, and in hiring the staff we desperately need to grow our company and improve our user experience. The other 15% will allow us to attend educational conferences and summits so we can learn from you and other educators what else we can do in order to improve your fundraising experience with us. 
Your support again:
Whether you decide to support us financially or not we would love to have you as a customer. Donations of any size are appreciated, but we would really love it if you would spread the word about this campaign and our platform. 
Thank you so much,

creator Mark Papadas has been speaking and working with educators to develop
curriculum to teach empowerment and emotional intelligence to elementary school
kids across the country. From this work, the I AM 4 Kids TV show was born. Each
episode is based on a true story of a kid being the embodiment of a different
empowering word. Each of the children featured will be invited (with their
parents’ approval) to be a recurring I AM 4 Kids character, giving the show
direct connections to communities across the country. 
<p><b><br/></b></p><h4><b>The Problem is Getting Worse</b></h4>
<p>There is an emotional intelligence and
identity crisis among the children of America. <a href=""http://thejnpproject.com/hot-topics/kids-self-esteem-statistics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Studies</a> show that over 50% of
American school kids have a negative self-image. Common responses from second
through fifth graders when asked to complete the statement, “I AM…” are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>I
AM…<b>fat</b>
</li>
<li>I
AM…<b>stupid</b>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>I
AM…<b>ugly</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>...and the identity they have as kids, is the
identity they will have as adults. </p>
<h4><b>Our Mission for this Campaign</b></h4>
<p>We believe the lack of stimulating kids TV
programming and violent video games aimed at kids today are major contributors
to this crisis. There is no shortage of researchers, advocates, and bloggers
complaining about the state of kids entertainment, but little is actually being
done to change it. Our mission is to produce the I AM 4 Kids TV show and video
game and prove to the networks that there is a LARGE audience out there
demanding this type of quality empowering and educational content for our kids.
Once produced, we see the I AM 4 Kids characters doing for empowerment and
emotional intelligence what the Muppets did for reading and math. </p>
<h4><b>The Movement has Begun</b></h4>
<p>This campaign is about much more than a TV
show - its about a MOVEMENT! A movement to empower our kids to grow into their
inherent greatness and resist peer pressure and bullying. In short, they learn
to become their own role models. </p>

Her name is Gabi. Sometimes snoozes the alarm and wakes up late for school. Her dream is to one day study Photography. She's a kid that has passions and goals. Well, she's also Deaf. She doesn't have too much trouble communicating with people. But it takes her time. A lot of time. Gabi is Deaf at birth. Sign language is her way of communicating. The language is complex, visual and non-vocal.Gabi also goes to school. She wants to ask her teacher questions about her course. She does it by:1. Throwing paper planes with notes at her professor.2. Using magnifying glass to read her professor's lips.3. Taping each class in video and then asking a friend for translation.
Maybe it's a bit exaggerated. But imagine - this is how it usually works. 
 Unconventional.
Is an application that serves Deaf people as a mobile translator. It provides two types of services. Real-time translation and text-to-speech translation. What do we mean?

For example Gabi wants to approach her professor with a question. She: Registers an Account

Appoints a day
Calls the sign language interpreter and.. 
That's it. The service can be used by any deaf person in different everyday situations.

I'm Alex Vigil-Emerson and I'm an illustration student at the <br/>University of Arizona in my junior year and I am on track to <br/>graduate in the spring of 2016. I am trying to fund my trip to study <br/>abroad in Orvieto, Italy.

The program lasts five weeks <br/>and includes trips to Rome and Florence to visit many famous <br/>landmarks and art museums in Italy.

<p>I have witnessed first hand how ENTRAPMENT - the deliberate framing and blaming of a citizen or group of citizens is being used to destroy the credibility, integrity and character of those who pursue the truth.</p>
<p>ENTRAPMENT is also being used to create conflict and crisis across the world.</p>
<p>ENTRAPMENT is the core problem facing HUMANITY as we are deceived by False Pretence and manipulation by a few.</p>
<p>This campaign is not about money - thats why I have assigned 0.29cents for every human being on the planet - ( the max permitted ) </p>
<p>This campaign is about bringing people together to make ENTRAPMENT ILLEGAL across the world - ENTRAPMENT must become A Criminal Offence - because currently it is NOT.</p> <p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b><br/></p>
<p>Awareness - we must make people aware of the dangers of ENTRAPMENT.</p>
<p>All citizens of the world must adhere to the LAW - if ENTRAPMENT is not Currently ILLEGAL - it can and is being used to destroy good people who speak out against injustice or against good people and nations being incited into conflict and war.</p>
<p><b>BENEFITS</b></p>
<p>The benefits or perks to you and your children will be a world no longer corrupted and mismanaged by those who abuse power and use entrapment to silence and suppress good people and the Truth.</p>
<p>Any funds created will go directly back into each global region where we can make a difference and see that ENTRAPMENT is made ILLEGAL.</p>
<p>If we can change a law in a nation location - it will be funded.</p>
<p>If we can create art and information to drive this message home it will be funded.</p>
<p>If we can demand change through numbers at a public meetings it will be funded.</p>
<p>Think of it like this - if we are talking 0.29 cents per human being on the planet you can see relative to your donation how many people you are helping.</p>
<p>All funds received will go towards implement change around the world - ending entrapment and making it a criminal offence.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>If we can make ENTRAPMENT ILLEGAL around the world it will no longer be available to those who have corrupted power over people.</p>
<p>I have managed global companies successfully in the private sector but I had never seen such horrific abuses of power and control as I witnessed when ENTRAPMENT was used to suppress good people trying to do the right thing.</p>
<p>I need your help to spread the word and make this happen.  </p>
<p>For if there is to be TRUST in the world with the systems we all live by then we as citizens must have TRUST that those in Control are not abusing that power and are not using ENTRAPMENT to shut down genuine concerns when mistakes are questioned.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The challenges are simple - we need numbers of people to force change in governments around the world to make ENTRAPMENT ILLEGAL.    </p>
<p>For if ENTRAPMENT is ILLEGAL it will no longer be permitted to be used on GOOD CITIZENS around the world.</p>
<p>We need Focal points in each country - established to create awareness and to push these demands so that a global solution to this concern can be implemented.</p>
<p><b>The biggest risk and challenge to ENDING ENTRAPMENT will be in opposing the resistance of a few.</b></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>There is much to do, and much that can be contributed to help.   </p>
<p>Every human being will in some way be able to contribute to this concern - spreading the word is easy - we are all now connected - get your friends to support this cause and make a massive difference in the world today, and the future tomorrow.</p>

Any funds created will go directly back into each global region where we can make a difference and see that ENTRAPMENT is made ILLEGAL.
If we can change a law in a nation location - it will be funded.
If we can create art and information to drive this message home it will be funded.
If we can demand change through numbers at a public meetings it will be funded.
Think of it like this - if we are talking 0.29 cents per human being on the planet you can see relative to your donation how many people you are helping.
All funds received will go towards implement change around the world - ending entrapment and making it a criminal offence.

    The Impact If we can make ENTRAPMENT ILLEGAL around the world it will no longer be available to those who have corrupted power over people.
I have managed global companies successfully in the private sector but I had never seen such horrific abuses of power and control as I witnessed when ENTRAPMENT was used to suppress good people trying to do the right thing.
I need your help to spread the word and make this happen.  
For if there is to be TRUST in the world with the systems we all live by then we as citizens must have TRUST that those in Control are not abusing that power and are not using ENTRAPMENT to shut down genuine concerns when mistakes are questioned.
    Risks & Challenges The challenges are simple - we need numbers of people to force change in governments around the world to make ENTRAPMENT ILLEGAL.    
For if ENTRAPMENT is ILLEGAL it will no longer be permitted to be used on GOOD CITIZENS around the world.
We need Focal points in each country - established to create awareness and to push these demands so that a global solution to this concern can be implemented.
The biggest risk and challenge to ENDING ENTRAPMENT will be in opposing the resistance of a few.
Other Ways You Can Help
 There is much to do, and much that can be contributed to help.   
Every human being will in some way be able to contribute to this concern - spreading the word is easy - we are all now connected - get your friends to support this cause and make a massive difference in the world today, and the future tomorrow.

It focuses on applied learning of core values and skills such as social responsibility, communication, ownership, accountability, integrity, and team work. It is far from a class where students are directed what to do. Instead, we will guide them but allow them to take the reigns; choosing projects they feel are important to themselves and the community. They will then plan, develop, and execute a solution to the issues at hand with the help of their fellow FTLA members. This will allow them to immerse themselves into a leadership role and truly learn in a rare environment of endless support and where mistakes are merely new lessons.  </p><p>FTLA will provide teachers who have been fully vetted and have many years of experience to attend meetings at schools twice a week. FTLA will also host conferences where speakers, more extensive leadership exercises, competitions, and presentations will be held among all local schools involved with FTLA. This allows students to create social networks beyond their immediate school and to learn from other individuals of different backgrounds. </p><p><b>How Your Donations Make a Difference...</b></p><p><b>$15</b> would cover one student in our academy for an entire week.</p><p><b>$25 </b>would give one student a month of free access to mentors and leadership courses.</p><p><b>$50 </b>would help provide a professional uniform for one of our students.

have a local network already established by FTLA to find internships and jobs, sometimes within our own companies. (See our interns in the image below!)

Completing the program would also allow students to use the certification and leadership experience on resumes and college applications. More About FTLA...FTLA has developed a curriculum that will create a community that cultivates continual growth and life-long learning. It focuses on applied learning of core values and skills such as social responsibility, communication, ownership, accountability, integrity, and team work. It is far from a class where students are directed what to do. Instead, we will guide them but allow them to take the reigns; choosing projects they feel are important to themselves and the community. They will then plan, develop, and execute a solution to the issues at hand with the help of their fellow FTLA members. This will allow them to immerse themselves into a leadership role and truly learn in a rare environment of endless support and where mistakes are merely new lessons.  FTLA will provide teachers who have been fully vetted and have many years of experience to attend meetings at schools twice a week. FTLA will also host conferences where speakers, more extensive leadership exercises, competitions, and presentations will be held among all local schools involved with FTLA. This allows students to create social networks beyond their immediate school and to learn from other individuals of different backgrounds. How Your Donations Make a Difference...$15 would cover one student in our academy for an entire week.$25 would give one student a month of free access to mentors and leadership courses.$50 would help provide a professional uniform for one of our students. Slacks, collared shirt, and jacket. This will enable them to be professional in every way for conferences, meetings, and as they reach out to their community. $108 would pay for a teacher/mentor for 1 week - traveling to 2 schools, twice each, and provide 2 hours of services.$300 is what it takes to supply material for 4 schools for 1 month.$500-1000 to host a local conference event involving FTLA students from 4 schools. EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS!!!To Thank Our Donors...There is very little we can do to fully show our appreciation of your support. But in our attempts to do so, please accept our tokens of thanks. Everyone who donates will receive a thank you email and will receive notification once we are up and running. We can't wait to show you the happy faces you've given chances to! For those of you who have donated a certain amount, our gifts will vary on the contribution size. Our gift packages will contain FTLA goodies and gear that everyone will want and we will not make available for purchase until after you all receive yours! Please be patient in receiving these, as they will not be sent out until after the campaign has finished and we tally up the number of rewards. Many of our higher appreciative gifts include free or discounted services from our affiliated business consulting firm: Fabian Business Consulting Group. We focus on startups and education, but can be utilized by all company types. FBCG can help from resumes and college applications, to helping you start or revamp your business through our marketing services, business plan writing, and much much more.

<p>Our next program will be on the subject of Parental

parent without justification, due to...indoctrination by the other parent.” </p>The clip I am using above is by Dr. Craig Childress, one of the foremost
 experts on the Parental Alienation Dynamic in the world. In this video 
he speaks directly to the reasons he feels therapists so often and so

Parental Alienation Syndrome. This forceful video will hopefully emphasize for you the urgent need to alter the process of family therapy so that children will no longer be misdiagnosed and further damaged.<br/><p></p>
<p>The purpose of this show is to help the psychiatric
and legal professions to understand how their lack of knowledge on this global
and divisive issue has exacerbated the trauma so many families are going
through. Your investment in this show will break open that traditional methodology
and encourage therapists, psychiatrists, mediators, lawyers, and judges, not
only to recognize the PAS dynamic when it is put in front of them, but to educate
themselves so that they can begin to find new ways to help these families. </p>
<p>On this episode of INSIGHT, we bring together a panel
of experts including Linda Kase-Gottlieb and Dr. William Bernet as well as alienated
parents, adults who were alienated as children, dramatic readings from family
therapy case notes, and much more. Once it has aired on KVCR, our plan will be
to market the show to other PBS stations as well as to individuals,

<p>Grief is unique, and as individual as those experiencing it, how we cope varies too.

<b></b><p><b>Transporting the kids </b></p>
<p>Each day we have to rent a <i>Matatu (</i>a taxi van, common for public transport throughout East Africa). They are notoriously dangerous with often fatigued, unlicensed drivers who drive recklessly and extremely fast. It’s like the African version of Russian Roulette! Even last month we lost a friend in a head on collision as she travelled to her school. The leading cause of death in Kenya is by no surprise; <b>motor vehicle accidents.  </b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443138717/vkvooarpgw6sjqkyud1w.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 472.03333333333336px; height: 238px;""/></b></p>
<p>Our temporary school is located in the town of Mtwapa, a 30 min drive from Mombasa City. This place is widely recognised as the child prostitution capital of Africa. Walking is not a viable option, as the children live far from the school, they would have to pass dangerous neighbourhoods and are very young. We need all of our kids to arrive at school safely and have a safe journey back home. To do this we desperately need your help!   </p>

<p><b>Transporting materials</b></p>
<p>We have researched and analysed the capital funding required for developing our new school and one thing remains very clear - transport of materials would be an enormous expense. Many of the materials we require to start construction at our new site are very affordable by western standards. However because the new site is reasonably rural and remote, transport costs for materials would mean less money invested into classrooms and school facilities. The best way we can help solve this is  transporting goods and materials ourselves! A van therefore can act as our school bus for students and then (with the seats folded or removed) can also be our delivery solution. With ample space, we can save tens of thousands in delivery charges! </p>

<h3><b>What's our story?</b></h3>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> My partner Lindsay started her work in Kenya, volunteering for an orphanage in Mombasa in 2013. Full of ideas and driven to make a difference, she became frustrated with the inefficient management and decided to break off and start her own school. I met Lindsay while travelling, after more than 10 years working as a ranger for national parks in Australia. </span>
</div>
<div>
<b>
</b><p>With my background being in  environmental science, sustainable land management and permaculture, I was looking for a way to use  the knowledge and skills to help others. Our ideas quickly merged into what is now <b>Eco Moyo Education Centre.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<div><b>Ultimately, we want to see entire communities live sustainably and produce healthy food, by introducing concepts for self-reliance and sustainable land management. Once the stomach is full, the mind becomes hungry. This is where our school comes in, focusing on holistic education for both children and youths as well as adults.</b></div>

<p><b>Current Setup</b></p>
<p>We are a PRIVATE, NO FEE SCHOOL with 21 students in a mix of Kindergarten and Primary levels. Our paid staff consists of 3 teachers, a chef and a watchman. </p>
<p>Together with our amazing Kenyan team, we are bringing education to the poorest of the poor thanks to our donor’s generous monthly contributions. Although primary education has been free in Kenya since 2003, free isn’t exactly free. There are still text books, transport, food and other expenses that mean many children are left behind.  </p>

<br/>
<p>Everything from the teachers salaries and rent to students medical bills and 3 meals a day are covered by these donations reaching roughly 1300 AUD per month.However, we are not planning on begging for donations year after year and are currently in the process of developing several businesses, the major one being a commercial aquaponic system (breeding fish and growing veggies in one system without soil and only recycled water). Income from this could eventually cater for running costs of our whole centre.  </p>

<br/>
<p>We want to prepare our students by developing their minds to face a challenging future. Statistically, few will find paid employment after they leave school, so it’s important for us to encourage and foster creativity, motivation and initiative. This is why unlike most schools, we offer many extra curricular subjects such as Art, Music, and Gardening while nurturing technical skills. We want our students to have the skills and ability to create their own job opportunities in the future.</p>

<h3><b>Our BIG Plan</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Just recently we purchased a 10 acre property for our new school location in the rural outskirts of Kilifi town. The property has ample space for a much larger school,  growing our own produce and demonstrating cost-effective, simple sustainable-living concepts. We believe that the permaculture system of integrating human needs into the living ecology of our natural environment is the only way forward for humanity on this earth. And the best way to prove this, is by walking the talk.</p>

<div>
<p> For the students safety and for us to grow and move forward to reach our goals, transport is vital. Currently the student’s transport to the school costs us 20,000 shillings per month (roughly $US200). This is an enormous expense for us and second only to the teacher’s salaries. For materials and errands, the school’s current transport solution is a motorbike (or piki piki) which we bought last year to save us money on local taxi’s. To gather materials and supplies we have a tomato <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">crate strapped to the back!  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our little workhorse has taken us everywhere and been an enormous help to the project but as we grow, it’s fast proving to be inadequate.</span></p>

<p>We
understand that times are changing  faster than ever. People are
looking for stable incomes but job security is declining at record
speed.  In the workplace a lot of people are being overworked and
underpaid on jobs they don't even have a passion for. People want
more freedom to do what they truly love and we want to help. 
</p>
<p>With the
shift in our economy many families are taking control of their lives
by becoming entrepreneurs and connecting with communities that can
lead them to wealth, health and spiritual growth.
This project  gathers today's top experts and thought leaders to
empower families to heal and achieve goals in all areas of their
lives. Families can now put an end to all their wealth, health and
spiritual struggles. The key to freedom is right here and there are
no limits.</p>

  All we have explained lead us to develop the
app ""Person to person direct money exchange”, a system that put persons in

P2p allow users to make a

in a way that other users who have the need to exchange that currency , could
be in contact , and coordinate all aspects of the exchange.  
  The app is equipped with advanced communications and instant message systems, Location maps , user profiles, guarantees, security measures and  agendas ready to facilitate the appointments and exchanges.
 
 The first global platform for user directly
contact and exchange money. User taking control of the currency exchange market
through direct cooperation.

  The application
has been designed to facilitate the direct exchange of  foreign currencies between persons. 
  Through this application, wherever you go, you will
find out people who needs the currencies your offer or people who carry the
currencies you need.
  Based on  2.0 technologies you will be in direct
contact with persons who need the currencies you
offer.
  The application allow users to conduct advanced multi-parameter
search, by person, date, currency, appointments and agenda, country and city,
etc.
  Person 2 person will
save at least 10 to 15% of your budget every time you change.
  This app is equipped with special features:
  Dynamic
Virtual

  Currencies validation
  Safe appointment.
  Cyber-libraries attach to mssg

  Equipped with integrated 
advanced free communications…
  The platform and app, verify all users, ask for official
documents to establish the correct identification.
P2P is the first of
54 applications and platforms we will be launching in a continuous way during
the coming  months. 
  All the apps have a common philosophy and  point to the same direction: defend consumers
against abusive providers and methots , allow them to get transparent  information and Global operational capabilities as Global
citizens, eliminate  unfair national and
international structures providing advanced collaborative tools and platforms
in 140 sectors and key categories like ( tangibles and raw materials,
Intellectual property and innovation products and services, Education and
training products and services, contents, information  and all kind of documentation ,
Professional,  consulting and advice
services  of all kind, transport,

, if the funds needed and requested to achieve the goals explained could not be
raised, we will continue working to market the ""Person to person direct
money exchange"" app and platform as well as the rest of the 54 apps . We
are not going to give up after 20 years working on them, with more than 100.000
asp files and DDBB developed . 


  We want everybody to
benefit from our technologies  by
providing them  for free. The resources
we need and ask for will make the difference. If we could get those financial
resources, the apps will be market a lot sooner and with a stronger and more
robust infrastructure to guarantee their correct functioning and success .  

  We also know by previous experiences that
those apps will affect the Business plans and profits of large transnational
corporations , and those corporations 
are not going to remain idle... But the consumers will save thousands of millions of dollars.

<p>Today's schools have very limited time and

participants, the program will expand on it's own to include people of 
every age, background and culture.<br/></p>The Giving Coin Project is :

<ul>
<li> <b>FLEXIBLE. </b>Defined as a ""Class Project"" Curriculum, the 
Giving Coin Project can be used in a number of ways deemed appropriate by
 the teacher or educator. There is no defined time structure or class schedule.</li>
<li>
<b>EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND EXECUTE. </b>Teachers may utilize the program as a single day project, utilize our online resources or customize a curriculum to suit their individual needs. </li>
<li>
<b>FREE</b> for both
 public and private schools.</li>
</ul>

Free?! So how can we give it away for free? Just 
like all non-profit organizations, we must communicate our needs to 
others to support our goodwill projects. Long term funding requirements 
will eventually be provided by corporate sponsors, grant requests and philanthropy.<br/><br/>However, this Pilot 
Program will be launched with contributions from our Crowd Funding 
Partners like you! Remember that the more successful this campaign is, the more students 
will be able to take part in this exciting program! The level of your giving will provide you with Perks -  or as <i>we like to say ""Thank you Gifts"".</i><ul>

and when you do, Give this Coin Away!""

Can you imagine doing one good deed and then having that one 
good deed blossom and multiply into unlimited good deeds performed all 
around the world for years to come?  
Designed to educate children, youth and adults, The Giving Coin Project
TM invites everyone to experience personal empowerment
that comes from the act of ""giving to others"".  Won't you join us?!   



                        

Our Educational Challenge - Empathy


Today's schools have very limited time and
 money to allocate for Character Values Education. Schools and society in general, struggle with self focused young 
people and acts of bullying on a daily basis. The core solutions to 
behavioral change comes from the realization of ones power to make a positive
 change in others lives through acts of GIVING. Discovering the joys associated with giving and helping others is truly life changing. 


   So let's see what this simple and effective program is all about! 
Click on video below...


               
This gold ""Giving Coin"" is a simple catalyst as a point of contact to inspire the performance of ""good deeds"" by all 
participants.                                              
The Giving Coin Project web site address is  imprinted on the front side of the coin and on the back side, a simple instruction:

      ""Do a Good Deed for Someone Today, and 
          When You Do, Give This Coin Away!"" 
                                       

Students document their special Good Deeds performed and create a detailed description on the Giving Coin Project web site.

 
Giving Coin participants are excited about beginning their  lifelong ""journey of giving"" with this combination of Old World and New World technology - a brass coin AND the ability to track it using the internet for countless years to come! A true ""hands on"" lesson in compassion and empathy! You can help give the GIFT OF GIVING this holiday season!

The program will initially be implemented within a structured 
educational or ""school"" environment. As coins are given away by 
participants, the program will expand on it's own to include people of 
every age, background and culture.The Giving Coin Project is :


 FLEXIBLE. Defined as a ""Class Project"" Curriculum, the 
Giving Coin Project can be used in a number of ways deemed appropriate by
 the teacher or educator. There is no defined time structure or class schedule.

EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND EXECUTE. Teachers may utilize the program as a single day project, utilize our online resources or customize a curriculum to suit their individual needs. 

FREE for both
 public and private schools.


Free?! So how can we give it away for free? Just 
like all non-profit organizations, we must communicate our needs to 
others to support our goodwill projects. Long term funding requirements 
will eventually be provided by corporate sponsors, grant requests and philanthropy.However, this Pilot 
Program will be launched with contributions from our Crowd Funding 
Partners like you! Remember that the more successful this campaign is, the more students 
will be able to take part in this exciting program! The level of your giving will provide you with Perks -  or as we like to say ""Thank you Gifts"".



Beginning

schools located in 7 countries around the globe. Let us introduce you to two of our pilot school partners!

Police violence has skyrocketed to the top of the national discussion in the past year and will remain in mainstream media as the rate of police killings is not de-escalating.  This campaign aims to create a platform for those affected by police violence the most:  family members who have lost loved ones to police murder.

<p>Teachable moments are being missed every day. This is why the <i>Smile, Don't Stare </i>campaign was launched. It focuses on understanding and is intended to help people rethink what they do, and what they say when they come into contact with a person - of any age - living with a disability. The campaign is working hard to turn stares into smiles and teach that it's OK to look, even better to ask questions.</p><p><b>Educational Curriculum:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>The <i>Smile, Don't Stare</i> educational curriculum is geared towards children in grades K-2. Children in this age group learn best through storytelling, so I have written a children's book called, ""You Have a Beautiful Smile"". Along with the book, there are parent and educator conversation guides that provide guidelines, talking points and answers that can help the adults in the children's lives be better prepared when the tough questions come up. <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">High School students affiliated with </span><a href=""http://www.bestbuddies.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Best Buddies</a><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> will be going into these classrooms to read the story and teach the curriculum to promote inclusion, satisfy the children's curiosity and turn those stares into smiles.</span></p><p><b><i>My Wish</i> PSA</b></p><p>We asked families we serve how they wanted to be treated in public.

Teachable moments are being missed every day. This is why the Smile, Don't Stare campaign was launched. It focuses on understanding and is intended to help people rethink what they do, and what they say when they come into contact with a person - of any age - living with a disability. The campaign is working hard to turn stares into smiles and teach that it's OK to look, even better to ask questions.Educational Curriculum:The Smile, Don't Stare educational curriculum is geared towards children in grades K-2. Children in this age group learn best through storytelling, so I have written a children's book called, ""You Have a Beautiful Smile"". Along with the book, there are parent and educator conversation guides that provide guidelines, talking points and answers that can help the adults in the children's lives be better prepared when the tough questions come up. High School students affiliated with Best Buddies will be going into these classrooms to read the story and teach the curriculum to promote inclusion, satisfy the children's curiosity and turn those stares into smiles.My Wish PSAWe asked families we serve how they wanted to be treated in public. Here is what they had to say:How Your Donations Will Help:The local school systems are ready, but we have a few more steps left before we can get the curriculum distributed to the schools. This is where your donations will help us!All of the materials are written and edited. The $10,000 will be used to add illustrations to the book, and have it published and printed - along with the rest of our materials. In more detail:


12 intricate design illustrations for ""You Have a Beautiful Smile""
Publishing of ""You Have a Beautiful Smile""
Printing of ""You Have a Beautiful Smile""
Printing of parent conversation guides
Printing of educator conversation guides
Printing of Smile, Don't Stare promise banners (to be signed by students after presentations)
Printing of Smile, Don't Stare promise buttons (to be handed out to students after presentations)

Every donations counts! We will be working hard to make sure our fundraising goal is met. We want the Smile, Don't Stare curriculum distributed and taught this coming school year.
Thank you in advance for your donations!Help Us Build a Movement!

Everyone can spread the word and join the conversation on the Lollipop Kids Foundation Facebook page or on Twitter @lollipopkidsfnd and by using #SmileDontStare.

<p>Hey, what's up! My name is Kyle Heser and I am a soldier of peace. I just graduated from Colorado School of Mines and am looking to put my engineering skills to work helping improve the life situations of those in need. I like to read, explore, and be outdoors.</p>
<p>At the end of December, a group of 11 Mines students will be traveling to Nepal as a part of the Hike for Help program and volunteering alongside the local Sherpa people in the village areas of Syangma and Chaurikharka, near the base of Mt Everest. We will be working to help rebuild the only high school in Chaurikharka, which was destroyed in the 7.8 magnitude earthquake earlier this year. Nearly 500 students from 1st through 12th grade rely on this school as it is the only education center in the area. Planning is underway to rebuild the earthquake-proof structures that are desperately needed. The cost of this project is approximately $200,000. So far, we have raised about 12%, or $25,000. I am hoping to personally raise $5000 towards the trip and rebuilding efforts.<br/></p>
<p>Hike for Help: Nepal is a nonprofit organization based out of Golden, CO. Founded in 2010 by Lhakpa Sherpa, owner of the Sherpa House and Cultural Center and an immigrant from Nepal, Hike for Help’s main objective is to foster a comprehensive strategy of small, focused projects with high impact, sustained by the local Sherpa community. Donations are tax deductible, and we are currently awaiting the final word on our official 501(c)(3) nonprofit application.</p>
<p>I have been working side-by-side with Lhakpa since early January to coordinate this opportunity to travel to Nepal from October - January 2016. My time will be spent working in southern Kathmandu and in Syangma and Chaurikharka, learning the culture and language and assisting with whatever relief efforts are taking place at the time. I will meet up with the team in December and continue work on the school.</p>
<p>Your donation will help directly fund me to travel to Nepal, and any extra money will be used for construction costs in country. Follow the trip blog throughout the project so you can keep up with our progress as well!</p>
<p>If you cannot help out with a donation today, don't worry! You can still help me out by spreading the word and sharing this fundraiser with your friends and family! Together, I know we can do this.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><i>Namaste, my name is Lhakpa Sherpa. I was born and raised at the base of Mt. Everest and attended the school in Chaurikharka, Nepal. Each day, I commuted 2 hours each way to attend classes. I was the first in my village to earn a high school diploma. This experience taught me that hard work and discipline builds strong moral character. After graduating in 1990, I spent several years guiding in the Himalayas. In 1996, I moved to the U.S. to pursue higher education and later opened several local businesses. I have been very successful and wish to pass on some of my good fortune to the people of Nepal. I attribute much of my success to the years I spent at the Chaurikharka school and want to ensure that the children in that area have the same access to education and opportunity. This is a great opportunity for me to help the children in Nepal. Please consider making a donation today.​</i><br/></p>

<p>Two years ago, we launched the pilot MISSION POSSIBLE KIDS
after-school program at Glen Oaks Elementary School in McKinney, TX. It was an
incredible success; to quote the principal, <b>“MPK is the most successful afterschool program we have EVER had, more
than triple the involvement of our other clubs…I can’t wait to see what our
kids do next!”</b></p>
<p>What we’re doing next is expanding. MISSION POSSIBLE KIDS is
poised to explode into schools and churches across the country. <b>We want to launch ­­­50 more MISSION
POSSIBLE KIDS chapters by this time next year. </b></p>
<p>In order to achieve and sustain all of these new chapters
and agents, <b>we need funding! So we’re
asking you to help us reach our goal of $15,000. </b></p>
<p>Take a look at what $15,000 could do in just the next year.</p>

We’ll send you a Helping Military Wounded Mission Pack, which includes 20 jean squares, frames, sharpies, instructions, and everything else you need to show our injured troops your love and support.<br/>

</div></div>","OUR MISSION
We’re on a mission to empower kids to change the world. We’re
on a mission to meet poverty and pain with caring and kindness. We’re on a
mission to make the leaders of tomorrow, who are ready to make a
difference TODAY! 



HOW WE DO IT
MISSION POSSIBLE KIDS is a national non-profit empowering
kids to change the world by helping others with more than 100 chapters in schools and churches in 38 states. Elementary-aged
kids become Agents of Change and
learn to think BIG! By doing hands-on
missions, they discover they can make a real difference in the lives of others, in their communities and around
the world. 
Hands-on TOP SECRET Missions include:      

Making gifts for kids in hospitals and shelters
Assisting with disaster relief
Reaching out to kids in orphanages and refugee centers
Supporting wounded US troops overseas
Touching the hearts of nursing home residents
Stocking food banks         
And many, many more!           



   



By changing the lives of others, our agents change themselves. They grow into compassionate, self-confident future leaders with a powerful work ethic and a lifelong commitment to volunteering, social responsibility, and giving back.

""There is too much unmet need in the world…MISSION POSSIBLE
KIDS’ vision is to build a much larger and more capable volunteer base both now
and in the future, by starting with America's kids.”--Points of Light Foundation https://missionpossiblekids.org/read-article-mpk-points-light-foundation

JOIN OUR MISSION
We have more than 17,000
current and former agents who, together, have touched more than 2,000,000 lives! Before MPK, no one
believed 1-5th graders could affect such far-reaching change, but it
happened. And now, we want to do more.
We want to give EVERY kid the opportunity
to change the world. And we’re starting in America’s schools, churches, and
other hosting sites.



Two years ago, we launched the pilot MISSION POSSIBLE KIDS
after-school program at Glen Oaks Elementary School in McKinney, TX. It was an
incredible success; to quote the principal, “MPK is the most successful afterschool program we have EVER had, more
than triple the involvement of our other clubs…I can’t wait to see what our
kids do next!”
What we’re doing next is expanding. MISSION POSSIBLE KIDS is
poised to explode into schools and churches across the country. We want to launch ­­­50 more MISSION
POSSIBLE KIDS chapters by this time next year. 
In order to achieve and sustain all of these new chapters
and agents, we need funding! So we’re
asking you to help us reach our goal of $15,000. 
Take a look at what $15,000 could do in just the next year.


That means that just $5 can help a child touch 65 lives. The social impact is ENORMOUS!
Our mission is only possible with your support. Help us help
kids change the world. Donate now.

York’s cultural scenes. Now we have a high visibility opportunity to shape
the narrative around Puerto Rican/Latin@ contributions and footprint to lower
Manhattan. Our curatorial team has already confirmed and gathered the
participation of high-caliber photographers, mixed-media artists and nationally
recognized scholars to collaborate, contribute to, and participate in the

elements like videos and audio elements. With the funds we hope to be able
to produce the best exhibit possible for all visitors. </p>

</span>Attains a high level of
excellence in Loisaida Inc.'s  first partnership with prestigious cultural
NYC institutions, such as the Bronx Museum and El Museo del Barrio. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Helps visitors to
reflect on the role played by Latin@s in civil rights issues and the impact of
the Young Lord's legacy through cultural activism in their aftermath.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Shows the progression of
social issues and the role of artistic styles in the factors that influenced
those changes. </p>

Loisaida Inc is a non-profit, community-development organization located in the Lower East Side (Loisada) neighborhood of Manhattan that is currently organizing an important exhibition, ¡Presente! The Young Lords in New York, from July 30-October 10, 2015. Like many non-profits, we rely upon the generosity of community members and
the general public to help sponsor many of our activities. In order to realize
this exhibit, we are seeking financial support from those who understand
the importance and necessity of communicating lesser-known perspectives of
the Young Lords legacy within the Lower East Side, and their impact upon New
York’s cultural scenes. Now we have a high visibility opportunity to shape
the narrative around Puerto Rican/Latin@ contributions and footprint to lower
Manhattan. Our curatorial team has already confirmed and gathered the
participation of high-caliber photographers, mixed-media artists and nationally
recognized scholars to collaborate, contribute to, and participate in the
first multi-site exhibition surveying the Young Lords Organization/Party.



What We Need 
 Your support will help us underwrite the physical elements
of the exhibit such as never before seen historical
photographs, panels, print photos, display mounts, and interactive
elements like videos and audio elements. With the funds we hope to be able
to produce the best exhibit possible for all visitors. 

The Impact
We hope that our exhibit does the following
· 
Enriches the Lower East
Side and general NYC community through the display of archival imagery,
historical contributions and events we have researched.
· 
Attains a high level of
excellence in Loisaida Inc.'s  first partnership with prestigious cultural
NYC institutions, such as the Bronx Museum and El Museo del Barrio. 
· 
Helps visitors to
reflect on the role played by Latin@s in civil rights issues and the impact of
the Young Lord's legacy through cultural activism in their aftermath.
· 
Shows the progression of
social issues and the role of artistic styles in the factors that influenced
those changes. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, here are other ways you can help!
· 
Ask folks to get the
word out and make some noise about our campaign
· 
Come and see the final
installed exhibit when it opens on July 30th -or any of the related events
until Oct 10th!

 We have been working extremely hard and
are so excited to see this exhibit become a physical reality! We now need your
help!

Az utolsó politizáló NYATA az 1988-as Találkozó volt. A Találkozók nagy szerepet játszottak a később közéletileg aktív akkori szakkollégista generáció életében, a szakkollégiumok, mint <strong>szellemi műhelyek</strong>, elismerten komoly szerepet játszottak az átalakulás folyamatában.</p><p>A rendszerváltás után többnyire <strong>a magyar társadalom egy-egy problémája köré szerveződtek a Találkozók</strong>, valamint kiemelt feladatuk volt a szakkollégiumi mozgalom erősítése és szakkollégiumok feladatának, felsőoktatásban elfoglalt helyének definiálása. A <strong>Szakkollégiumi Charta</strong> lefektetésére is egy Nyári Találkozón (Zánka, 1991) került sor.

A szakkollégium egy szakmai és egyben baráti közösség, egyetemi diákszervezet, melynek tagjai támogatók egymást önálló kutatásokban, továbbá közösen végeznek tanulmányi munkát. A magyarországi Szakkollégiumi Mozgalom 3 alappillére a szakmaiság, a közösség és a társadalmi érzékenység.A szakkollégiumokban a  magas színvonalú szakmai munka és tehetséggondozás van előtérbe helyezve, beleértve a kiemelkedő képességű és a hátrányos helyzetű diákokat is. Fontos alapérték a diákönkormányzatiság és az alulról szerveződés, a megfelelő közösségi élethez pedig elengedhetetlen az együttlakó bázis. Az egyének az egyetemi tananyagot meghaladó ismereteket az elméleti és gyakorlati tudás összekapcsolásával, kurzusok, előadások formájában sajátíthatják el.Mi a NYATA?A Nyári Szakkollégiumi Találkozó (NYATA) a Szakkollégiumi Mozgalom legfontosabb, immáron több évtizedes hagyománnyal rendelkező, évenkénti Találkozója, ahol a hazai, illetve kárpát-medencei szakkollégiumok hallgatói vesznek részt. A szakkollégiumok, mint a hazai felsőoktatás tehetséggondozásának fontos műhelyei, kiemelt figyelmet fordítanak tagjaik, a kollégisták emberi, szakmai fejlődésére, valamint társadalmi érzékenységére.Mitől különleges a NYATA20?Technológia és társadalomKözös gondolkodás különböző szakterületekrőlSzakmai programok, előadások, workshopokVitakultúra fejlesztéseBarátságok, kapcsolatokFelejthetetlen élmény, mini-fesztivál hangulat​3 szakkollégium közös erőfeszítései:Energetikai SzakkollégiumSimonyi Károly SzakkollégiumSzéchenyi István Szakkollégium2 egyetem tudásának ötvözése a szervezésben:​Budapesti Corvinus EgyetemBudapesti Műszaki és Gazdaságtudományi Egyetem***Támogass minket!A részvételi díj fejenként ~50 USD, amelyet nagyon sok fiatal, érdeklődő egyetemista nem engedhet meg magának. Célunk, hogy arányos támogatói rendszerrel a szakkollégisták kedvezményes áron vehessenek részt a Találkozón. A 50 USD-os részvételi díj azonban csak egy részét fedezi csak az egy főre jutó költségeknek, így ezen felül minden adományt külön megköszönünk.Az 50 USD tartalmazza a szállást, napi háromszori étkezést, a részvételt szakmai és közösségi programokon, valamint promóciós ajándékokat, mint repohár, jegyzettömb, toll.Hogyan segíthetsz nekünk?Többféle támogatói csomagot állítottunk össze, így mindenki kiveheti a részét a NYATA megvalósításából:
5 $-os támogatói csomag
10 $-os támogatói csomag, melyet NYATA20 emléklappal honorálunk
50 $-os támogatói csomag, melyet NYATA20 pólóval hálálunk meg
100 $-os támogatói csomag: ha nem csak egy diáknak, hanem magadnak is örömet szeretnél okozni, legyél Te is a NYATA20 résztvevője!
200 $-os támogatói csomag, további szponzori kategóriákért lépj kapcsolatba a szervezőkkel!
***A Nyári Szakkollégiumi Találkozó rövid történeteA legelső Találkozót 1985-ben rendezték Szarvason. Azóta az utóbbi időkig néhány kivételtől eltekintve kétévente kerültek megrendezésre. Az első Nyári Találkozók erősen politikai töltetűek voltak, ellenzéki hangnemben szerveződtek; ugyanakkor céljuk volt az országban fellelhető problémák megvitatása. Az utolsó politizáló NYATA az 1988-as Találkozó volt. A Találkozók nagy szerepet játszottak a később közéletileg aktív akkori szakkollégista generáció életében, a szakkollégiumok, mint szellemi műhelyek, elismerten komoly szerepet játszottak az átalakulás folyamatában.A rendszerváltás után többnyire a magyar társadalom egy-egy problémája köré szerveződtek a Találkozók, valamint kiemelt feladatuk volt a szakkollégiumi mozgalom erősítése és szakkollégiumok feladatának, felsőoktatásban elfoglalt helyének definiálása. A Szakkollégiumi Charta lefektetésére is egy Nyári Találkozón (Zánka, 1991) került sor. A mai napig az országos szakkollégiumi közösség egyik legfontosabb eseményei ezek a találkozók, ahol az ország különböző pontjairól és határon túlról érkező szakkollégisták találkozhatnak egymással, és aktuális kérdéseket vitathatnak meg.***Eddigi Találkozók1985: Szarvas1987: Pápa1988: Balatonszárszó1991: Zánka1993: Fadd-Dombori1995: Csopak1998: Baja2000: Kemence2002: Kemence2004: Gyalu (Erdély)2006: Eger2008: Fadd-Dombori2010: Pécs2011: Nagyvárad (Erdély)2012: Velence2013: Eger-Felsőtárkány2014: Balatonfenyves2015: Kolozsvár (Erdély)2016: Szeged",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p>Hi, I'm Enicia Fisher, Founder of The Element School. I'm a teacher, writer, yogi, proud mom of two bright and creative kids, and I care deeply about education and lifelong learning. I love to <b>build community</b> and I am passionate about bringing people together to <b>care for each other and the earth</b>. I have a Master's degree in education and started out teaching in a special education classroom. I've taught all ages, from elementary through high school, college writing, and creativity courses at my local yoga studio. For the past ten years I've taught an integrated arts enrichment program to homeschoolers in my local community with the long-held vision of starting an independent school based on my <b>passion for creativity, ecology, and community</b>. I'm ready to offer the unique model I've developed as a model independent school for elementary, middle, and high school students.<br/></p>
<p>We are super excited to launch The Element School! Once we finally secure a site for our programs, we are going to use this as a <b>model school</b> with the intent of developing <b>sister schools</b> in other communities across the globe. This site will serve as a home for our day school programs, after-school arts outreach, family and community education programs. We'll also establish a <b>permaculture community garden</b>. <br/></p>
<p>I have created a vision for holistic education based on a platform of <b>consciousness in education</b>. In my forthcoming book, Learning to Thrive, I have articulated 5 lenses of consciousness that enhance learning and empower students: <b>creative, social, environmental, global, and empowerment consciousness</b>. I believe the vision and design of The Element School has great potential to bless and transform individual lives and communities, not just in my backyard but as a model that can be replicated according to the unique needs and interests of other communities.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a minimum of $43,188 in start-up expenses to get the school up and running.
 This amount will go toward the lease deposit and first month's 
rent, the city permit, remodeling, upcycling furniture, 
infrastructure for the community garden, basic classroom 
supplies, and incorporation &amp; professional fees including establishing a <b>non-profit 
501c3</b> so that we can apply for grants to provide a healthy <b>scholarship 
fund</b> for student tuition. We want our private school to be accessible to
 any student who truly desires to be a part of our program.</p>
<p>We've chosen flexible funding so that whatever funds we raise will go straight into startup costs. <b>Any extra amount will go toward student scholarships.<br/></b></p>
<p>We think you'll be excited about our unique perks. We've created a <b>""Pay it Forward""</b> campaign. Rather than focusing on giving you a bunch of stuff you probably don't want, we're going to show you a key element of our school: our <b>social enterprise</b> business model. For each level of donation, we'll do a unique <b>service project</b> for others, <b>expanding your donation</b> into a ripple effect of kindness and empowerment that will reach countless people! (You'll still get some fun goodies which I know you'll <b>LOVE</b>!)<br/></p>
<p>Our perks also relate to the 5 lenses of consciousness...check it out!</p>
<p>You'll get a handmade friendship bracelet with a <b>compassion</b> meditation woven into it (may you be <b>happy, well</b>, and filled with <b>peace</b>), beautiful <b>inspirational</b> art prints created by a student artist (see the ""gallery page"" to view them!), an advanced reading copy of my upcoming book <b><i>Learning to Thrive</i></b>, establish a guild in your honor in our <b>community</b> <b>garden</b>, sponsor a mindfulness mini-retreat for parents, sponsor a student through a scholarship, and <b>create a ripple effect of good in the world</b>!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contributions will directly benefit students and families in our community, and will continue their impact through our commitment to environmental and social service and our plans to develop a sister school model. <br/></p>I have built a vital community around this vision and I have individuals and families ready and waiting to make this vision a reality. Since 2005 I've successfully offered <br/>this program on a part-time basis in a variety of community settings, so I expect even greater <b>success</b> with our own site, a team of fantastic teachers, and a full-time school full of students actively <b>co-creating an excellent, innovative, empowering educational program</b>.</div> <div> <h3>We don't just want your money!

<li>This campaign is important to me because  I am concerned about the alarming dropout rate in the country in St. Vincent and the Grenadines and the Caribbean. I am doing volunteer work in  St. Vincent and the Grenadines  in the area of education. I have ran summer programs here for  four years. I was aware during my work that many children were not reading on grade level. I worked with many of them one on one. I noticed remarkable improvement.  I  have also produced educational television programs on the local station. I lacked funding to keep it up on a regular basis. I was watching television and I heard about the alarming dropout rate here. I did research in the St. Vincent and Grenadines Educational Statistical Digest 2013 published by the Ministry of Education. There was a total of 235 dropping out of primary school.1,296 out of secondary school ,224 were only in Form 1. That is an age of 12 years old!Kindergarten had 33. Compulsory education is from 4-16.My name Christopher Blackman and I am all familiar with these islands as I am greatly involved in volunteer work here in the schools.I am proud that I produced a children television program  that was appreciated by the children and their parents.When you think of the Caribbean Island, you may picture lush,white beaches,idyllic scenery of turquoise waters,and a true tropical paradise.Many people visit these small islands in the Caribbean to escape a stressful and hectic lifestyle,all to find amazement and relaxation as they explore colorful coral reefs by scuba diving and sail on the calm waters. However,for the people that make their lives there,the picture is different.St Vincent and the Grenadines house approximately 115,000 friendly people. Many of the families in the villages are unemployed and living in poverty. The island has reliable electricity,telephones and water;however many of the residents cannot afford electricity , water and telephone service.They depend on government-supplied public showers and water spigots. One-fourth of the population comprises children ages 1-14 years.Education is free until secondary school.Due to the extreme economic conditions many families face poverty,education is placed behind the need for the children to work on the farms.Parents or guardians cannot afford books,supplies, transportation and food. As a result,unemployment is very high,and many children and teenagers resort to illegal activities and are ultimately locked up in jail. It is not like these children do not want an education. Poverty prevents them.There has been a rise in pregnancy. Children having children. Many families are migrating with children who are below average in their schoolwork.Education is the one key to getting out of poverty. I want to use the power of television to offer educational programs. The goal is to have a television program that will be available to children and their parents.I have done this in the past. It was a success. The lack of funding forced me to discontinue. Many homes do not have computers.<br/>

<li> Education can help empower and is the most influential tool for any society to thrive.You should already see the enormous value of what I am trying to do here.

We know a lot of people who needs a solution like this,so tell your friends to contribute so we can promote it to the world.

Poverty prevents them.There has been a rise in pregnancy. Children having children. Many families are migrating with children who are below average in their schoolwork.Education is the one key to getting out of poverty. I want to use the power of television to offer educational programs. The goal is to have a television program that will be available to children and their parents.I have done this in the past. It was a success. The lack of funding forced me to discontinue. Many homes do not have computers.

 Education can help empower and is the most influential tool for any society to thrive.You should already see the enormous value of what I am trying to do here. I'd like to serve as an inspiration for other entrepreneurs and meaningful social causes to get out there and release their innovations to the world through the crowdfunding model. We know a lot of people who needs a solution like this,so tell your friends to contribute so we can promote it to the world. Sharing this campaign on your social media profile is just as valuable as an actual financial pledge.

Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you. Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.  Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?

But during the time schools were closed due to the outbreak, the Ebert-Kakua school was not idle. 
Using their own funds as well as grants from German and Spanish NGOs, the staff has expanded the campus to include a dormitory and community hall.
A residential program was started because it's dangerous for deaf students to cross all the busy streets to get to school (in the past few years there have been multiple injuries to deaf students and one fatality).  In addition, the entire country of Sierra Leone has only 3 official schools serving the entire country's deaf population.

</div></div>","Who Are We?

Arts for All is a highly creative charity (charity no. 1096859) serving the disadvantaged communities of tower hamlets and Hackney. The organisation runs structured weekly art therapy sessions to engage people of all ages from divers cultures and background and those with special needs. The centre sits within one of the most deprived areas of the UK. Some 75% of the families served by the centre are unemployed and 50% have English as a second language. Through long-term support, Arts for all builds confidence, helps people achieve their goals and changes lives.



What Are We Gonna Do?
We're going to have a wild day out at Hever Castle in Kent (the ancestral home of Anne Boylen): coach trip, picnics, wonderful scenery and castle, archery, boating lake and ............. a full-blown reinactment of a Tudor jousting tournament attended by Henry VIII and Anne Boylen.
We know that many of the families and individuals who attend Arts For All are not in a position (for many reasons) to go out of London and do something so exciting and wonderful. We are committed to making this trip happen and would love your support. For those who chose to support this trip please be assured that, from our great experience, this day out will be life-changing for so many people and something that they will remember for ever!
ANY DONATIONS, NO MATTER HOW SMALL, WILL GO A LONG WAY!

<span style=""font-size: 36px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;"">A STEAM Camp in Guinea</span>
</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;"">Guinea is
one of the least developed countries in the world, rated 182nd in the Human
Development Index and recently ravaged by an Ebola epidemic. From these facts alone, it is
no surprise that the educational system in Guinea is broken, and Guinean students
are left behind in the dust. Guinea desperately needs health care
providers, infrastructure engineers, well-trained teachers, and many more well
educated professionals. However, relatively few development organizations are
on the ground in Guinea, compared to nearby Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Senegal.
Cultural barriers are high, especially for English-speaking and Christian
charities in this Francophone, primarily Muslim country. And yet, innovative,
curious, determined young Guineans are just begging for the chance to learn
more and expand their horizons. Luckily, we’ve assembled a team that is
uniquely capable of helping youth in Guinea expand their horizons, and we’re
going to start this summer through a STEAM camp.</span></h3>
<p>The Hope
of Guinea STEAM ( Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Science) Camp 2016
that will take place from July 11th to July 29th and is a joint initiative
between Hope of Guinea, MindLeaps, and Returned Peace Corps Volunteers from

<p>Well into implementation, the concept of the camp is to provide resources and innovative ways of learning to kids in Guinea whether in  school or on the street. Hope of Guinea aims to provide hope to all children with its first STEAM Camp. For three weeks, from Monday through Thursday, selected kids of junior high age will perform experiments, participate in engaging field trips, and develop techniques in traditional and non traditional dance forms. </p>
<p>Planned experimental activities include: chicken dissection, microscope skill lessons, a bridge building competition, DNA extraction, a game modeling disease spread, and the creation of electromagnets. Several field trips are planned, such as a visit to a hydroelectric dam and a sustainable farm. </p>

It encourages critical thinking and failure, two aspects of learning that are never emphasized in the memorization-bound Guinean education system.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
One very successful event that members of our
team led was a National Science Camp. We’re using the framework from that,
combined with current learning methods and artistic outlets to make a
significant change in the lives of the 50 students and 5 teachers at our camps.
We know from previous camps that students introduced to new, exciting
experiences will go home with confidence and a new found curiosity in exploring STEAM and its correlation to the challenges that their communities face. Additionally, we will be training 5 Guinean teachers from across the country on
how to run camps like this one in their own schools. Not only will they
participate in our camp, but they’ll go home with a written guide and materials
that they would never have been able to procure otherwise, like microscopes,
calculators, and test tubes. Once our camp is finished at the end of July, we
will encourage the teachers to organize their own camps, ideally right before
school starts in October and create after-school science clubs. If each of our
five teachers holds a camp with 30 students per semester, our project will have
been responsible for bringing scientific discovery to 300 students in one year. </div>
<div>We are currently in the process of creating a tool to assess the camp and the impact that our 5 teachers will have. We are committed to giving hope to Guinea's future STEAM leaders and hope you join us in our initiative. </div>

</div></div>","A STEAM Camp in Guinea

Guinea is
one of the least developed countries in the world, rated 182nd in the Human
Development Index and recently ravaged by an Ebola epidemic. From these facts alone, it is
no surprise that the educational system in Guinea is broken, and Guinean students
are left behind in the dust. Guinea desperately needs health care
providers, infrastructure engineers, well-trained teachers, and many more well
educated professionals. However, relatively few development organizations are
on the ground in Guinea, compared to nearby Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Senegal.
Cultural barriers are high, especially for English-speaking and Christian
charities in this Francophone, primarily Muslim country. And yet, innovative,
curious, determined young Guineans are just begging for the chance to learn
more and expand their horizons. Luckily, we’ve assembled a team that is
uniquely capable of helping youth in Guinea expand their horizons, and we’re
going to start this summer through a STEAM camp.
The Hope
of Guinea STEAM ( Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Science) Camp 2016
that will take place from July 11th to July 29th and is a joint initiative
between Hope of Guinea, MindLeaps, and Returned Peace Corps Volunteers from
Guinea. The STEAM Camp is based on a successful project designed and
implemented by Peace Corps Volunteers in the summer of 2014. 




          



Well into implementation, the concept of the camp is to provide resources and innovative ways of learning to kids in Guinea whether in  school or on the street. Hope of Guinea aims to provide hope to all children with its first STEAM Camp. For three weeks, from Monday through Thursday, selected kids of junior high age will perform experiments, participate in engaging field trips, and develop techniques in traditional and non traditional dance forms. 
Planned experimental activities include: chicken dissection, microscope skill lessons, a bridge building competition, DNA extraction, a game modeling disease spread, and the creation of electromagnets. Several field trips are planned, such as a visit to a hydroelectric dam and a sustainable farm. 
One of our partners, MindLeaps, will bring lessons on traditional Guinean dance, hip-hop, and classical ballet. Instructors will praise effort and use growth mindset tools like summarizing to help students access long-term memory.  A ""growth mindset"" is a way of learning that is supported by research in neuroplasticity and psychology. It encourages critical thinking and failure, two aspects of learning that are never emphasized in the memorization-bound Guinean education system. We believe that by opening our students eyes to a ""growth mindset"" and engaging them fully through art and dance in addition to science, engineering, math and critical thinking skills, we can make a lasting impact on the leaders of today and tomorrow.

<p>Hi, I'm Cam Hawkins, I run a popular financial trading podcast called 52 Traders where I interview successful financial traders from around the world to see what makes them tick. </p>
<p><b>Today I'd like to let you into my world and share with you the skills I've acquired through my unique approach to trading via a ""tell all"" online course that is guaranteed to reduce risk, save you time trading and put you in a better position when it comes to earning a ""passive income"" as a trader. </b></p>
<p><b>On top of all this.. it's FUN!</b></p>
<p>But first, here's my story...</p>
<p>For the past 7 years my trading career has mainly revolved around automating my trading. I’m not the type of person who enjoys sitting watching charts and waiting for trade setups to occur and when I stumbled across automated trading I thought I’d found the answer!</p>
<p>It allowed me to use software (aka trading robots) that would do all the work for me and enter and exit trades when certain criteria were met (these criteria are based on trading strategies - strategies can be conjured up using simple math and a bunch of tools readily available to you). </p>
<p>However, after <b>I spent thousands of dollars buying automated trading robots</b>, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">with no success,</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> I turned to developers to build my trading strategies into robots... only to find they had no vested interest in making these robots profitable. This cost me a small fortune!</span></p>
<p>Then I ended up trying a different approach... and I want to create a course to teach you everything I know about building, testing, optimizing and trading these robots.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>I want to give you the opportunity to learn all about these trading robots:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>how to build them</li>
<li>how to test they work and match your trading strategy </li>
<li>how to optimize them to find the ""most"" profitable settings</li>
<li>how to trade them live or on a demo account with a broker</li>
</ul>
<p>... all before you let them loose on the markets to trade for you on autopilot earning you that <b>""passive income"" </b>- while you sleep, spend time with friends/family or go shopping to spend all the money you're making!</p>
<p>So, here’s everything you need to know about the trading robots you will end up building:</p>
<ul>
<li>The trading platform I use is called Metatrader 4 or MT4. There are 1000’s of brokers all around the world who let you download this trading platform for FREE. You simply open a demo or live account with them - you don't even need to fund the account. </li>
<li>MT4 runs on a Windows PC (sorry about that Mac users) and connects to your broker through the internet.</li>
<li>The software plugin that automates trades for you (aka the Trading Robot) is called an Expert Advisor or EA and this plugs into Metatrader 4.</li>
<li>And the software I use to build EA’s is called FxDreema.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">FxDreema can be used for free with some limitations. This gives you the time to learn it or simply ""try it out"". </span><br/></p>
<p>When you need to use the full version of FxDreema and unlock the limitations, you will need to pay a small fee which FxDreema allows you to pay for in blocks. </p>
<p>The great thing about their model is that you’re not stuck in a contract or anything like that. A three month block seems to be the most affordable at $11 per month while a one month block costs $19. Plus, you can get it for as low as $7.90 per month if you lock yourself in for a year like I do. It basically works out at the same cost as a trip to McDonald's once a month for one person!</p>
<p>And remember, I'm including a FREE 3 month FxDreema subscription for anyone who takes up the Full Course perk.</p>
<p><a href=""https://fxdreema.com/subscribe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to see the full FxDreema subscription model</a><br/></p>
</div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The course I plan to create will teach you how to use FxDreema to build EA’s based on trading strategies (I provide some high quality trading strategies in the course that you can practice on if you don't have any of your own). I'll then teach you how you ensure your strategy is profitable by back testing it on the historical market data. You can test it on things like Fx, Commodities, Metals and Indicies in before you trade it using real money.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 
Hi, I'm Cam Hawkins, I run a popular financial trading podcast called 52 Traders where I interview successful financial traders from around the world to see what makes them tick. 
Today I'd like to let you into my world and share with you the skills I've acquired through my unique approach to trading via a ""tell all"" online course that is guaranteed to reduce risk, save you time trading and put you in a better position when it comes to earning a ""passive income"" as a trader. 
On top of all this.. it's FUN!
But first, here's my story...
For the past 7 years my trading career has mainly revolved around automating my trading. I’m not the type of person who enjoys sitting watching charts and waiting for trade setups to occur and when I stumbled across automated trading I thought I’d found the answer!
It allowed me to use software (aka trading robots) that would do all the work for me and enter and exit trades when certain criteria were met (these criteria are based on trading strategies - strategies can be conjured up using simple math and a bunch of tools readily available to you). 
However, after I spent thousands of dollars buying automated trading robots, with no success, I turned to developers to build my trading strategies into robots... only to find they had no vested interest in making these robots profitable. This cost me a small fortune!
Then I ended up trying a different approach... and I want to create a course to teach you everything I know about building, testing, optimizing and trading these robots.

I want to give you the opportunity to learn all about these trading robots:

how to build them
how to test they work and match your trading strategy 
how to optimize them to find the ""most"" profitable settings
how to trade them live or on a demo account with a broker

... all before you let them loose on the markets to trade for you on autopilot earning you that ""passive income"" - while you sleep, spend time with friends/family or go shopping to spend all the money you're making!
So, here’s everything you need to know about the trading robots you will end up building:

The trading platform I use is called Metatrader 4 or MT4. There are 1000’s of brokers all around the world who let you download this trading platform for FREE. You simply open a demo or live account with them - you don't even need to fund the account. 
MT4 runs on a Windows PC (sorry about that Mac users) and connects to your broker through the internet.
The software plugin that automates trades for you (aka the Trading Robot) is called an Expert Advisor or EA and this plugs into Metatrader 4.
And the software I use to build EA’s is called FxDreema.


FxDreema can be used for free with some limitations. This gives you the time to learn it or simply ""try it out"". 
When you need to use the full version of FxDreema and unlock the limitations, you will need to pay a small fee which FxDreema allows you to pay for in blocks. 
The great thing about their model is that you’re not stuck in a contract or anything like that. A three month block seems to be the most affordable at $11 per month while a one month block costs $19. Plus, you can get it for as low as $7.90 per month if you lock yourself in for a year like I do. It basically works out at the same cost as a trip to McDonald's once a month for one person!
And remember, I'm including a FREE 3 month FxDreema subscription for anyone who takes up the Full Course perk.
Click here to see the full FxDreema subscription model

   What I Need & What You Get 

The course I plan to create will teach you how to use FxDreema to build EA’s based on trading strategies (I provide some high quality trading strategies in the course that you can practice on if you don't have any of your own). I'll then teach you how you ensure your strategy is profitable by back testing it on the historical market data. You can test it on things like Fx, Commodities, Metals and Indicies in before you trade it using real money.
Full Course:
By joining here on Indiegogo you'll become a ""Founding Member"" and get the contents of the Full Course which is as follows:




A complete FxDreema EA Builder course - Value: $1997



Dedicated MT4 testing platform - Value: $800


10 FxDreema Templates - Value: $300



10 Proven Trading Strategies - Value: $1,000



3 Month FREE FxDreema Subscription - Value: $57



Community Access - Value: $1000



BONUS Candy Shop EA: FxDreema Template & Optimized MT4 Settings


Below is a visual demonstration of the time you will save using the course versus trying to do it yourself (DIY). You'll see that by your third or fourth strategy you'll be creating it in hours versus weeks or even months. That's the benefit of having a course walk you through everything!



The funding...
Today I need your help funding this project because:



I estimate it will take me in excess of 200 hours to create the course. That's 4 weeks, working 8 hour days. So I'm basically looking for your help to subsidize the hours I'll put into creating the course at a subsidized rate of $20/hr, i.e. $20 X 200 = $4,000.

There are also additional costs associated with the ongoing running of the website where you will login to learn the course content
I also want to know that people are interested in this type of course

I also want your feedback on how the course is structured so that it can meet the needs of all my students from the least to the most technical and those new to trading versus the experienced trader

I know that courses are followed and people learn and apply the skills when people have a ""vested interest"" and helping fund the course will be your vested interest and help with your learning and enjoyment

If I meet the funding goal I will aim to complete the course within 45 days. 
I have made a promise that the course (should it go ahead) will be priced at no less than $497 USD when it is complete. So as a Founding member, here on Indiegogo, you will have access to it at a much lower investment. 
To learn more about what's on offer and a strategy you can use when applying this course please take the time to watch this webinar I recorded recently for my subscribers ""3 Secrets to Acquiring Profitable MT4 EA's"". In the webinar you will see some content that is not relevant to the Indiegogo offer, please ignore this.

    The Impact 
I’ve touched on just a few of the benefits to using this approach to trade the markets and I know that the upside potential is huge. 
As part of my podcast I have interviewed 3 different traders who make a significant living trading a handful of automated strategies consecutively, while they enjoy a life most of us only dream of through the Passive Income they create!
You can listen to 2 of the interviews on my podcast website here:


Kevin Davey interview


Tim Rea interview
 

Today I want to share my knowledge to make that kind of life available for you too!

On top of this, there are many ways (outside of trading the markets using these robots) that can generate you a passive income and I'll include details of these within the course. 
In some cases you can make more money with these strategies than through trading alone.
   Risks & Challenges The main risk is me. If something were to happen to me that would prevent me from finishing the course within 45 days I would first look to see if an acceptable date could be accommodated by asking you first and those that do not want to wait that long will be refunded. I'll also drip feed finished content into the course when it is ready so that you do not have to wait until all the content is finished - hence reducing the risk further.
I have all the software, tools and websites in place to publish the course so there are no risks with regard to members having access to the content. It's just the content generation that is still required.
    Other Ways You Can Help If you like the idea of this course and want to help and don't have the funds it would be great (and much appreciated) if you could paste a link to this page on any trading forums, blogs or trading communities you belong to.
Many Thanks!

<p><b><u>I.  Short Summary:</u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Building Future Global
Leaders for Peace through Education &amp; Arts:</b></p>
<p><b>The Genesis Academy
Summer Institute 2016</b></p>
<p>Since 1999, Genesis at the Crossroads has been building peace
programs around the world through arts and education.<span>  In 2015, Genesis launched the Genesis Academy
Summer Institute, which brought together global youth for a transformational
educational experience.  Within the next
three years, the Summer Institute will evolve into the summer quarter of the
Genesis Academy for Global Leadership – a four-year boarding high school for
global youth offering an experiential curriculum that fosters critical
thinking, cross-cultural collaboration and understanding through the arts fully
integrated into the humanities and sciences. 
</span></p>
<p>Our 2015 Summer Institute brought together young adults ages
15-19 from conflict and post-conflict zones to learn experientially in four
curricular areas:<span>  heroes and human
rights, music and peacebuilding, environmental sustainability and peace
journalism.  The 2016 Summer Institute
will bring in a new cohort of students to learn in cross-cultural teams – a
process that cultivates respect and understanding across boundaries, languages
and points of view.  The students will creatively
engage with the arts in an inter-disciplinary curriculum that fosters critical
thinking, innovation, cooperation and humanism. 
</span></p>
<p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/wbez-worldview/global-activism-genesis-at-the-crossroads"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>https://soundcloud.com/wbez-worldview/global-activism-genesis-at-the-crossroads</u></a></p>
<p>Genesis’ Founder and Executive, Dr. Wendy Sternberg, has
built Genesis at the Crossroads over the past 16 years into a thriving peacebuilding
organization, forging global partnerships with 45+ institutions on five
continents.<span>  She masterminds the creative
development/management of inquiry-based salon programs at the nexus of human
rights, human development and the arts and founded <i>Saffron Caravan</i>, uniting musicians from Iran, Afghanistan, Cuba,
Morocco, Israel, India, Bosnia, Brazil, Japan and the US for cross-cultural
collaborative performance and educational programs.  (Please see the link below.)</span></p>
<p>Under her leadership, Genesis boasts over 100 award-winning
programs, internationally-acclaimed by the UN, The Kennedy Center, Rotary International,
The King of Morocco, the British Council, the US Institute of Peace and the US
State Department.<span>  Rotary International
selected her as one of 22 world leaders for their 2009 Peace Fellowship.  In 2014, marking the 100<sup>th</sup>
anniversary of World War I, she was selected along with 59 other global
activists, to be a Salzburg Global Seminar Fellow and participate in an
international consortium on the power of arts and culture to transform our
world.  A participant in the Clinton
Global Initiative, she configured the Genesis Academy for Global Leadership as
a scalable global model for peace education (her CGI commitment.) Her medical
career informs the healing aspects at the heart of Genesis.</span></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>II.<span>  What We Need + What You Get:</span></u></b></p>
<p>We need to raise $150,000 USD to bring 20 global students to
the 2016 Summer Institute.<span>  These funds
will cover not only  international travel
+ room and board (at a university center), but also all ground transportation,
supplies/educational materials, faculty honoraria, field studies, admission for
all museums and other visited institutions, and the final closing ceremony
showcasing their work.  </span></p>
<p><b><i>(All surplus funds go towards future Genesis Academy Summer
Institutes and building The Genesis Academy for Global Leadership, a $34
million boarding high-school school with endowed scholarships for its future
students.) </i></b></p>
<p>The Perks:</p>
<p>Depending upon your level of support, our peacebuilding-perk
gifts range the gamut from your very own Genesis Saffron Caravan CD or a unique
set of our peace quilt cards designed by children with their vision for world
peace, a Genesis guitar pick or a personalized engraved brick along the Genesis
Academy’s Path to Peace.<span>  You can have
your name proudly displayed on our website for funding a student's travel or
full scholarship.  Greater investment on
your part, could create your personal sponsorship of a Saffron Caravan concert to
help us raise even more...</span></p>
<p><b><u>III. Impact</u></b></p>
<p>In this conflict-saturated world, we believe innovative
education will provide the most powerful way to address and solve intractable
problems and thereby, transform humanity.<span> 
</span></p>
<p><b><i>What if you had a hand in helping us find next-generation

<p>Giving to the 2016 Genesis Academy Summer Institute empowers
you to bring real opportunity not only to conflict-torn areas of the world, but
also to the future prospects for peace by nurturing bright, young leaders
through the arts and a rich experiential curriculum.<span>  Moreover, it helps lay the foundation (within
the next three years), for building the Genesis Academy for Global
Leadership:  a four-year boarding high
school in Chicago that will immerse future leaders in four years of the same
arts-rich curriculum, designed by experts. 
</span></p>
<p>When students work and learn in cross-cultural teams, they
learn to respect one another and appreciate diverse perspectives different from
their own.<span>  An inter-disciplinary
curriculum embedded with art cultivates both their critical thinking and
humanism.  Our Academy, which
incorporates an incubator- lab for academic studies on creativity and
leadership, engages our four university partners: University of Pennsylvania,
Stanford University School of Medicine Center for Compassion and Altruism,
Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy and DePaul University.
(Others are in progress...)</span></p>
<p>Genesis at the Crossroads has been healing conflict through
education and the arts for 16 years.<span>  The
2015 Summer Institute already enriched the lives of young people from conflict
and post- conflict zones around the world. 
Our students came from Pakistan, Cambodia, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, and
the US.  Together, they explored many
complex issues locally and globally, accomplished professionally crafted blogs,
recorded podcasts of renowned heroes working in human rights and environmental
sustainability, created frameworks for children’s stories addressing pressing global
issues and wrote the lyrics and score for an original song and professionally recorded
it in a music studio.  They created
photography exhibits, journaled about their personal journey, and became a
community of internationally-networked youth leaders - “Ambassadors for
Peacebuilding.”</span></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>IV.<span>  Risks and Challenges:</span></u></b></p>
<p>We have a 16-year proven track record of doing educational
and artistic programs in a variety of settings in and outside the classroom and
of producing programs all over the world, some in times of great challenge–
from Morocco, to Jerusalem and the Bedouin community during the Arab Spring, to
Bosnia in the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary year of the genocide in the former
Yugoslavia - to those at home in Chicago and across the US. We have faced visa issues for artists and
students, prevailed despite conflict crises worldwide, and continue to employ a
smart, creative and tenacious team of artists, educators and managers to
deliver our programs.<span>  </span></p>
<p>The Summer Institute gives us not only valuable experience,
partnerships and expertise, but also helps us build a coalition and network of
supporters to realize the vision of the Genesis Academy for Global
Leadership.<span>  In the longer term, we face
the challenges of building this new school in Chicago – a four-year boarding high
school that will include the Summer Institute as its summer quarter.  We need to purchase land, build the
facilities, furnish technology and libraries, develop curricula, pay teachers
and artists, and house our students. 
This vision requires expertise and a budget of $34 million USD.  We look forward to also endowing
scholarships to make this financially accessible for qualified, talented students
from all over the world.</span></p>
<p>While some have suggested we use a closed-down school and
build the boarding school at a later date, we prefer to build our educational
movement, model and our institutional legacy with <i><u>our</u> </i>vision for a boarding community that engages young
people in transformative education in social justice, human rights and the arts
while they live <em><u>and</u></em> learn
together.<span>  If this takes a few years
beyond 2018, we will continue the Genesis Academy Summer Institute as is, along
with all of our other Saffron Caravan and Salon programs, in the meantime – we think
it will be worth the wait!</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>Initially when I
started the campaign my focus was on my needs and what I wanted to achieve,
however as I began to appeal for assistance on social media the positive
responses have taught me about community, shared ideas, reciprocity and
inspiration. There is a community of people who want you to succeed and have
taught me about paying it forward. This has made me offer more service to others.
I fund campaigns that are focused on personal development. I have learnt the
need for a strong team to share ideas and build a strong brand. Not all
strategies are going to be successful and a team of people sharing ideas can
help realign your strategies. Reciprocity has been the biggest lesson I have
learnt. In order to receive you have to give, and giving comes in all forms. In
order to succeed you have to create mutually beneficial relationships. I have
been humbled and inspired by all the shares my campaign has received thus far
and this has only made me work harder to achieve my goal. For an ordinary South
African female to be able to study abroad will have a chain effect in inspiring
others to overcome their fears and follow their dreams. In order to inspire
others you have to walk the walk and talk the talk and I believe I can achieve
that.  Starting this campaign has
definitely made me a better person and I’m constantly looking for ways to align
my strategies with being of service to others. By the end of this campaign I
hope to learn how to be better at paying it forward to others. </p><p></p><p></p><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459622011/IMG_5114.v3_rjaops.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">How will you pay it forward</b></p><p>My goal it to be able to open a drama studio at the Mangete Primary School in South Africa.  The school is close to my heart because I attended this school as a little girl and all our drama events took place at a community hall which was later burnt down. </p>
