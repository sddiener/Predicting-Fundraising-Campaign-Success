It's an original work that makes use of familiar themes and takes place in traditional fantasy settings. It differs from other books because it’s not a retelling, but still takes advantage of the influential ideas and themes set forth in classic fairy tales, as well as countless other stories since.<br/><br/>Strict attention has been paid to the quality of the book, as well as much research to ensure that it brings something fresh to the table.

<p>Still, so many of you continued asking for a physical version, and I'm grateful you did because it pushed me to look into self-publishing again. Thankfully, the world of self-publishing is ever-changing, and the answer has eventually showed itself, and I've worked out a way to fully fund production of the book for about 20% of what it would have taken just a few years ago. ($1060 as opposed to $5000.) I just <i>know</i> we can make this happen!</p>
<p>Since the book is already 100% completed and ready for printing, the $1060 will go to cover ISBN purchase, set-up costs with the publishing company, listing fees, and the costs of printing and shipping the books.  </p>
<p>By donating $25 or more to my campaign, you are ensuring your copy(s) of the book.  Higher pledge levels are available for those of you who either want to purchase extra copies as gifts, or to donate to libraries, day care centers, church nurseries, etc.  Those who pledge for multiple books will also receive extra perks such as book marks, posters, and even the e-book!  But even if you do not want to purchase a copy for yourself, you may certainly make your donation and let us know where you want your copy(s) sent.  Shipping in the US is no additional charge.  We will be shipping world-wide for $20.</p>
<p>For those of you who are looking to show your support without purchasing the book, we have the $1 and $5 donations available.  Some people just can't contribute monetarily, and I completely understand.  That doesn't mean you can't help!  Of course, the most important way you can support the book is by sharing this campaign link via all of your social media accounts!  Getting the word out is vital.</p>
<p>'Sinceriously', all I want is to see this book printed and in the hands of those who can appreciate it, both young and young at heart. So tweet it, Instgram it, Facebook it, e-mail it, blog it, shout it from the rooftops, etc!  #TheSecretDoor (A lot of which can be accomplished with the sharing tools right here on Indiegogo.) If you do donate, please also share that you donated, and ask your friends and family if they might take a look at the campaign as well.</p>
<p>Now I know many of you originally expressed interest in giving the book as a gift for the holidays, and with December around the corner, that doesn’t leave much time. So if you are anxious to receive your copy(s) of the book in time for this year’s giving season, I urge you to make your pledge sooner rather than later.  The sooner the campaign is funded, the sooner I can place the order. Many of you specifically asked for your copies to be signed, and that requires the books be shipped to me before being shipped to you, which naturally adds extra processing time.</p>
<p>For those of you who would like your copy(s) of the book signed by me, please be sure to indicate that when you make your pledge.</p>

<p>Now known as Connetic Word, the CT National Youth Poetry Slam Team began in 1998 when the Capitol Region Educational Council helped 
host the first-ever National High School Poetry Slam.  Teams came from
NYC, Worcester, Washington DC, the Navajo Nation from New Mexico and of course,
CT.  It was a 2-day event, held at the Charter Oak Cultural Center in Hartford.</p>
<p><span>The
following year, a new CT team went to Albuquerque for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Annual
National High School Slam, along with seven other teams including San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Chicago.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><em><em>""I write because I need to escape"" ~ Taimoni</em></em></strong></span></p>
<p><span></span><span>This
festival continues to grow and is now known as Brave New Voices, with up to fifty
participating teams over five days. It is held in a different city each
year (San Francisco, NYC, Philadelphia, Ann Arbor, Los Angeles, Chicago,
Seattle) and has included teams from most major cities in the US, as well as
from Bangladesh, Bosnia, India, England, Canada, South Africa, Ghana and
Trinidad.</span></p>
<p><span>Brave
New Voices presents the youth of 21st century America in all their verve and
diversity.  The festival focuses on arts education and performance, local
program development, national movement organizing and the highlighting of a new
generation of performing artists, audiences and literary opportunity. </span></p>
<p><b>""Poetry is the honesty too raw for polite conversation"" ~ Michaela</b></p>
<p><span>Connetic Word is one of the only teams to invite
participation from around the state, rather than one major city.  Members
for 2015 include young writers from Rockville, Canton, Manchester, New Haven,
Enfield and one member from just over the New York line.</span></p>
<p><span>As
part of a larger organization, Connetic Word hosts poetry slams throughout the
year and offers spoken word workshops and slam orientations for schools and
youth organizations in the Northeast. We provide an outlet and a stage for
young writers and performers. We </span>help empower confident, engaged, literate, ethical
and critically conscious young men and women with events that showcase the
talent and passion of young people.</p>
<p><span>“Connetic

literary and stage opportunities that were not available when I was a
struggling teenager, trying to find my voice,” says founder and organizer,

</div></div>","Annexe Magazine is releasing for pre-order 25 copies of JT Welsch's The Ruin and Susie Campbell's The Frock Enquiry. This is a very limited first run (50 copies) so you are guaranteeing yourself a copy by pre-ordering one!What are they?Susie Campbell's The Frock Enquiry uses the Enquiry into Women's Work by The Women's Industrial Council 1900-15 as its backbone. It imagines how these working women might have constructed voices for themselves out of the language of their work - taking it apart and reassembling it to forge a new and 'unnatural' rhetoric of interrogation, myth and protest. JT Welsch's The Ruin is set in the ruins of Tunisia and jumps between Carthage, old Star Wars sets, empty hotels, and the footsteps of other visiting artists and writers, exploring and raising difficult questions on the role of tourism and cultural appropriation in the wake of the 2011 revolution.


Who are they?

Susie Campbell's
poetry has been published in print and online magazines including The Interpreter's House, Shearsman, Domestic
Cherry, Envoi, Smiths Knoll, Amaryllis, Verity La and Litmus. Her first poetry pamphlet The Bitters was published by Dancing Girl Press in 2014. In the
same year she also competed an MA in creative writing at Oxford University and
was the inaugural recipient of Oxford's F.H.Pasby prize. She works in a full
time job providing services to disabled young people and is currently
completing a first novel, set in the world of mental health care. 
JT Welsch has published four pamphlets of poetry, including Orchids (Salt) and Waterloo (Like This). His poems have also appeared in 3AM, Blackbox Manifold, Boston Review, Manchester Review, PN Review, VLAK, and other magazines and anthologies. He lives with his partner and dog in York, where he is lecturer in Creative Writing and English Literature at York St John University.

What is Annexe Magazine?

Annexe is sadly closing this year, these two pamphlets are its last publications. We hope to see you at the London launch on 23rd October, which will also be a celebration of Annexe's work over the years.
The two pamphlets were edited by Claire Trévien. They will be hand-bound by Lucie Forejtová at Immaginacija.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hi my name is Victoria Barkan and I’m here to ask for your help to get my book entitled ""The Monkeys Rule"" finished and published. The outline is complete and I have about a third of it written.  I have been working on it for about 15 years.  Actually most of that time was spent learning what I was to write about.  I have to laugh now as the (politically correct) reason I gave for leaving the consulting firm I was working for many years ago was to write this book, thinking that I knew what was to be in the book.  Little did I know that I had just started down this path of learning...learning and experiencing spiritual growth. </p>
<p>I came out of a corporate career where my successes and innate ability threatened a lot of people. As a result, I experienced discrimination and unfair treatment of several different types. Yea, I know you might find that hard to believe given I was in a corporate environment but it is true...really. After several decades of mistreatment I was changed, I mean really angry. A friend called it rage...ready to go postal.  I mean can you believe it...I had a list.  I totally bought into the victim mentality at a deep subconscious level.</p>
<p>At the time I had no idea what the law of attraction was or how my thoughts and programming (conscious and unconscious) affected how the law of attraction worked for me.  I had no idea how those thoughts and programming which turn into beliefs especially the unconscious ones, really run a person’s life.  I call them the Monkeys.  </p>
<p>The book is about my experiences, the discrimination that kept me from earning the living I was capable of earning and going to the levels I could have gone, the anger that then accumulated, my discovery of the monkeys and how they engaged my anger, then the journey to learn to tame them.  I learned all of this on the road to discovering how one is responsible for every single thing that happens to oneself in life...a concept that was difficult for me to comprehend in the beginning. After all I did not do those things to me...""they did""...chuckle!</p>
<p><strong>What we nee</strong>d <strong>and what you get.</strong></p>
<p>To get this project to completion I need seed money to move forward. I must raise $1000 for Fractured Atlas to show that I can raise money on my own and then I can be helped to procure grant money.  The most pressing need now is a new computer which is a must as mine is very old and has difficulty interfacing with the websites I’m working on.  Just the other day my 4 in one printer, copier, fax and scanner died and my camera is also broken.  Additionally, I need a piece of equipment to convert slides and photos to digital format for insertion into the book.  The $4500 is only enough to get me started. There will also be expenses for websites and editors to speak of only a few which is why Fractured Atlas and the hope for grant money is so important.</p>
<p>Oh! And let’s not forget the funding for the Perks and their shipping.  I have created several perks that are fun and represent your ground floor involvement in helping me move forward with this project.  At some of the higher levels of giving you get signed ‘original limited edition prints’ of “The Monkeys Rule: Insatiable” I painted it from a picture of the Nazca Lines Monkey I took on a trip to Peru back when I was working...lots of symbolism in that painting which will be the cover of the book.  You can see the painting on this website and ONE lucky person can even claim the original 30” x 30” acrylic on canvas.  Of course there are other perks like copies of the E-Book, signed copies of the printed book and special commemorative T-Shirts, depending on the level of contribution you choose.</p>
<p>Your contributions are tax deductable to the extent the law allows.   The fair market value stated under each perk must be deducted from the total contribution to arrive at the amount of your contribution that is tax deductable depending on your individual situation.  If you prefer a total tax deduction and do not want any perks, just name your contribution level. </p>
<p><strong>So what is the Impact?  </strong></p>
<p>This book can be a bridge for those who are awakening to their spiritual growth.  This has little to do with organized religion in the literal sense and everything to do with increasing your consciousness level and vibrational frequency.  There has been a lot published lately about the Law of Attraction but none of those authors deal with the Monkeys.  The Monkeys that keep the Law of Attraction from working the way we consciously want.</p>
<p>My hope is to open a world of modalities that deal with the Monkeys that up to now have only been there for the few with the courage to open their minds and lead the way to change.  This book can serve to give those ready, those that have reached the level of integrity and courage, the help they need to move forward and tame their Monkeys creating a better life for themselves and therefore the world. If it helps only one person I will consider the book a success!</p>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Times;""><span style=""font-size: large;"">'The Threads of Moira' is a novel full of action, drama, excitement, romance and humor. It combines several genres and spans its bow refined over the past, the present and the future. It is filled with phantasy and fiction, but it's also relative to normal life. It's philosophical, psychological, emotional and political.</span></span></span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">“The Threads of Moira,” a mystery novel, is based on two major themes: Ariadne’s thread in the Labyrinth, and the role of predestination in life – the fates as it were.  Greek mythology refers to the fates as <em>the Moirai</em>.  In the Homeric poems, the fate called <em>Moira </em>is related to the end of one's life.  The novel is actually three interwoven stories that mirror the labyrinth of life. It is about the so-called  thread that we consciously or unconsciously follow until we are called home.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Holly Edwards receives a letter in the mail one day from someone she does not even know. In the envelope is a copy of a scientific journal article, along with a warning that it is for Holly's eyes only - not to be shared with anyone, kept secret.  Holly believes it was sent to her by mistake and decides to return the letter.  Just then, someone knocks on her front door and identifies himself as an FBI agent.  Holly is questioned by him concerning a murder that recently occurred in her neighborhood.  During this conversation Holly discovers that the sender of the letter is suspected of being the murderer. Although she knows that she should tell the agent about the mysterious letter and article, her intuition tells her not to. Instead, she conceals it.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">The next morning Holly receives another letter – this one threatening. She sets out to find answers and is led to a secret scientific circle.  From there, Holly becomes entangled in ever more mysterious, nerve-wracking events. Eventually, what she learns not only totally shatters her worldview and puts her life in extreme danger, but also makes her aware that humanity itself is in grave danger. </p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">The “story within the story” is about Holly's deceased grandparents who often come to mind in the midst of her travails.  Their wisdom, which Holly never fully appreciated or understood, turns out to not only be her greatest help, but awakens her to the deepest and most profound truths about herself.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">Ultimately, the reader gets decides what is fiction and what is reality as Holly goes on the journey of her life - a Hero’s Journey in which she must fully explore all her traits, foibles and aspects, find and utilize every ability she has, and actualize her full potential. </p>

<p><strong>ABOUT JANE RUSSO AND THE PROJECT</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Jane Russo</strong> is a pseudonym that <strong><em>I</em></strong> chose to write mystery novels.</p>
<p>I am a German author who has been successful in writing and publishing books in other genres. So far I have made my living within psychological, psychic, artistic and social media marketing areas.</p>
<p>The threads of Moira is my first work in the field of mystery novels, or at least my first work that I intend to make available to the public. A novel that will be exciting not only within the main story, but also within the emotional development of the protagonist. A novel that is close to reality and yet fiction.</p>
<p>The story already exists in its basic structure, it only has to be written down, which will take me about one year. After that is has to become edited by an editor, to be set by a graphic designer and finally published. Subsequently I want to get the book translated into English and make it available as an e-book as well as a print edition for the English speaking world.</p>
<p>Parallel to writing the book, I plan to frequently post parts of the <strong>MAKING OF</strong> at the new offical Jane Russo blog  <a href=""http://www.JaneRussoNovels.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Jane Russo Novels Blog"">JaneRussoNovels.blogspot.com</a>. I imagine to publish passages and quotes of the progressing book, to get people involved in the writing development.</p>
<p>Those who have supported my book project with a huge amount of money will have the chance to help shape, by voting about characters, appearance, names and origin of the supporting actors. And of course those sponsors will be mentioned in the book not only as official sponsors, but also as active members of the creative team, if they wish.</p>
<p><em><strong>(<a href=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/736606/files/20130402134515-Perks_English.pdf?1364935519"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""All Perks in Detail"">see all PERKS DESCRIPTION in the attached PDF to get more information</a>)</strong></em></p>
<p>I welcome everybody to friendship me at my Facebook and Google+ page and to follow me at my Twitter acount and help me to make the book known.

ENGLISH VERSION
Summary
'The Threads of Moira' is a novel full of action, drama, excitement, romance and humor. It combines several genres and spans its bow refined over the past, the present and the future. It is filled with phantasy and fiction, but it's also relative to normal life. It's philosophical, psychological, emotional and political.
 
“The Threads of Moira,” a mystery novel, is based on two major themes: Ariadne’s thread in the Labyrinth, and the role of predestination in life – the fates as it were.  Greek mythology refers to the fates as the Moirai.  In the Homeric poems, the fate called Moira is related to the end of one's life.  The novel is actually three interwoven stories that mirror the labyrinth of life. It is about the so-called  thread that we consciously or unconsciously follow until we are called home.
Holly Edwards receives a letter in the mail one day from someone she does not even know. In the envelope is a copy of a scientific journal article, along with a warning that it is for Holly's eyes only - not to be shared with anyone, kept secret.  Holly believes it was sent to her by mistake and decides to return the letter.  Just then, someone knocks on her front door and identifies himself as an FBI agent.  Holly is questioned by him concerning a murder that recently occurred in her neighborhood.  During this conversation Holly discovers that the sender of the letter is suspected of being the murderer. Although she knows that she should tell the agent about the mysterious letter and article, her intuition tells her not to. Instead, she conceals it.
 
The next morning Holly receives another letter – this one threatening. She sets out to find answers and is led to a secret scientific circle.  From there, Holly becomes entangled in ever more mysterious, nerve-wracking events. Eventually, what she learns not only totally shatters her worldview and puts her life in extreme danger, but also makes her aware that humanity itself is in grave danger. 
 
The “story within the story” is about Holly's deceased grandparents who often come to mind in the midst of her travails.  Their wisdom, which Holly never fully appreciated or understood, turns out to not only be her greatest help, but awakens her to the deepest and most profound truths about herself.
 
Ultimately, the reader gets decides what is fiction and what is reality as Holly goes on the journey of her life - a Hero’s Journey in which she must fully explore all her traits, foibles and aspects, find and utilize every ability she has, and actualize her full potential. 
 
ABOUT JANE RUSSO AND THE PROJECT
 
Jane Russo is a pseudonym that I chose to write mystery novels.
I am a German author who has been successful in writing and publishing books in other genres. So far I have made my living within psychological, psychic, artistic and social media marketing areas.
The threads of Moira is my first work in the field of mystery novels, or at least my first work that I intend to make available to the public. A novel that will be exciting not only within the main story, but also within the emotional development of the protagonist. A novel that is close to reality and yet fiction.
The story already exists in its basic structure, it only has to be written down, which will take me about one year. After that is has to become edited by an editor, to be set by a graphic designer and finally published. Subsequently I want to get the book translated into English and make it available as an e-book as well as a print edition for the English speaking world.
Parallel to writing the book, I plan to frequently post parts of the MAKING OF at the new offical Jane Russo blog  JaneRussoNovels.blogspot.com. I imagine to publish passages and quotes of the progressing book, to get people involved in the writing development.
Those who have supported my book project with a huge amount of money will have the chance to help shape, by voting about characters, appearance, names and origin of the supporting actors. And of course those sponsors will be mentioned in the book not only as official sponsors, but also as active members of the creative team, if they wish.
(see all PERKS DESCRIPTION in the attached PDF to get more information)
I welcome everybody to friendship me at my Facebook and Google+ page and to follow me at my Twitter acount and help me to make the book known. I would like to present the book in March 2014 at the Leipzig Book Fair. If it needs more time to get the final work to be realized, I would bring it to the book fair in Frankfurt in autumn 2014.
My contribution that I would like to give to the world as a token of gratitude to all the people who support my project, is to make the e-book available for free for all deaf-mute people and to grant a huge discount on the e-book for students and those among us, who cannot afford to buy a hardcover-book. 
While the book gets edited, I plan to also get an interactive iPhone/Android/Windows app to be developed, which will be another Indiegogo project to being financed, which will bring good advertisement chances for sponsors. 
Another intention, which I would like to realize as a subsequent project is to get the book implemented as an audiobook which I would like to give away free for blind people.

Eines Tages erhält das Dienstmädchen Molly Edwards einen mysteriösen Brief einer ihr Unbekannten, dessen Inhalt, eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit sie gut verwahren und ausschließlich der Verfasserin selbst aushändigen soll.
Der Überzeugung, dass es sich um ein Missverständnis handelt, beschließt sie den Brief an die Absenderin Sharon Andrews zurückzuschicken.
 
Doch noch am selben Abend erhält sie unerwarteten Besuch von einem Detective des FBI, der ihr Fragen zu einem Mordfall stellt, der sich in der Nachbarschaft ereignet hat. Dabei erfährt sie, dass die Absenderin des Briefs unter Mordverdacht steht. Obwohl ihr bewusst ist, dass sie von dem Brief erzählen sollte, hält sie irgendetwas davon ab.
 
Als sie am nächsten Morgen einen Drohbrief erhält, macht sie sich auf die Suche nach Antworten und verstrickt sich dabei immer mehr in mysteriöse Ereignisse, die nicht nur ihr Weltbild aus den Angeln heben und ihr Leben in Gefahr bringen, sondern deren Folge eine Bedrohung für die gesamteWeltbevölkerung bedeuten könnte.

dirigidos hacia la producción final, su publicación y  mercadeo. Éste es mi primer proyecto como
escritor y verdaderamente, un esfuerzo muy significativo.  He estado dando conferencias acerca de mi
vida por los últimos catorce años, y estas me han brindado gran perspectiva para
el desarrollo de este libro. He analizado minuciosamente las memorias de mi
niñez y vida de adulto para facilitar algunas situaciones que aunque extremas, son
transformativas.  La historia evoca una
vida llena de <b>contrastes</b> que asalta nuestros  sentidos y provoca la <b>intuición</b>.
Incita a lo <b>radical</b>, a lo <b>oscuro</b> y a lo <b>enigmático</b>. La desigualdad opresiva que
te confrontará, exige evolución. He utilizado fragmentos de realismo mágico

My name is Luis Felipe Passalacqua, former Medical
Illustrator, and now Puerto Rico’s first and only Blind Sculptor.  I've been working on this bio-fiction for the
past year and now all the energy and resources are intended for its final
production, publication and marketing stages. 
This is my first project as a writer and truthfully, a very significant
endeavor.  I've been giving conferences
about my life experiences for the past fourteen years, which have given me great
insight into the development of this project. I've dissected the memories of my childhood and entire adult life in
order to facilitate some extreme but transformative experiences.  The story evokes a life full
of contrasts that assaults our senses and provokes the intuition.  It incites the radical, the obscure, and the
enigmatic.  You will be confronted by an
oppressive inequality that demands evolution. I've used fragments of magical realism to ease
the path of understanding the dissolution of our perceptions and realities, our
freedom.

book is based on my life experiences, more than in theoretical or learned information. It comes from the core. Arts, science, and belief structures converge
in this profound search for independence. 

I’m
excited to be collaborating with 

  ...to bring this
book to you.  Because of its significance,
it is my intention to publish it in Spanish and in English.  To bring this project to life we need your
total commitment to cover the cost of those devoting their time and resources
to make this happen, including the publishers.

Mi nombre
es Luis Felipe Passalacqua, Ilustrador Médico, y ahora primer y único Escultor Invidente
de Puerto Rico.  He estado trabajando en
esta bio-ficción durante el pasado año y ahora toda la energía y recursos están
dirigidos hacia la producción final, su publicación y  mercadeo. Éste es mi primer proyecto como
escritor y verdaderamente, un esfuerzo muy significativo.  He estado dando conferencias acerca de mi
vida por los últimos catorce años, y estas me han brindado gran perspectiva para
el desarrollo de este libro. He analizado minuciosamente las memorias de mi
niñez y vida de adulto para facilitar algunas situaciones que aunque extremas, son
transformativas.  La historia evoca una
vida llena de contrastes que asalta nuestros  sentidos y provoca la intuición.
Incita a lo radical, a lo oscuro y a lo enigmático. La desigualdad opresiva que
te confrontará, exige evolución. He utilizado fragmentos de realismo mágico
para aligerar el camino que nos lleva a entender la disolución de nuestras percepciones
y realidades, nuestra libertad.

Estoy muy contento de estar colaborarando con Author House para traerles este libro.  Debido a su  significado profundo, es mi intención
publicarlo en español y en inglés.  Para
darle vida a este proyecto, necesitamos su compromiso total para ayudar a cubrir el costo de aquellos que han dedicado su tiempo y recursos para lograrlo , incluyendo a los publicadores.
YOU CAN MAKE THIS POSSIBLE BY SPONSORING ME!

If our goal of $18,000 is not reached,  funds accrued by the end of the campaign will be used for the creation and publishing of the Spanish version of
this book.

DESIRED IMPACT

Our hopes are that ""él"" (Spanish) and""he"" (English),
motivate the reader towards self examination as an individual and
as part of society, creating awareness of the ignorance, the prejudice and the obstacles that a
person faces when segregated, or belongs to a minority.  It is our intention to condemn the
consequences of such ideas and attitudes that may cause difficulties for
some in the rehabilitation, the access to equal opportunities, and the total
participation of all that the society to which he belongs, has to offer.


IMPACTO DESEADO
Nuestra esperanza es que  “él” (español) y "" he” (inglés), motiven al lector  a examinarse  a si mismo y a la sociedad en que vive, creando conciencia
sobre la ignorancia, el prejudicio y los obstáculos a los que una persona hace
frente cuando es segregada, o pertenece a una minoría.  Es nuestra intención señalar las
consecuencias de tales ideas y actitudes que puedan causar dificultades para
algunos en su rehabilitación, en el acceso a oportunidades justas, y su
participación de todo lo que la sociedad a la que pertenece, pueda ofrecer.

CHALLENGES
  With time and  resources on our side we must beat every single deadline to bring these outstanding publications to the public.  Author House is already working with the Spanish version but we need to jump in and capture momentum with the English project.  Our intention is to bring them out simultaneously.  This is why our backer communities are so important.  If we experience delays, the Spanish version will come out first, followed by the English translation. 
Finances  are challenging at this point. We constantly keep strict controls.
We will definitely keep all deadlines in check for the next 60 days. 








All contributions are welcome!!!
¡¡¡Toda contribución es bienvenida!!! We are striving to start contributions at $25 but there are other ways you can help if you can't afford to sponsor our projects  at this time.  We understand.
Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.

 Use the Indiegogo share tools, all the social media you are familiar with and of course - word of mouth!!!

<p><i>Nobody told Bob that when he became a vampire, he would still have to keep his job at the porn-shop. Foul-mouthed, sarcastically funny, Bob is completely new to the whole vampire life. His ex-girlfriend hates him, he's addicted to blood, his Vampires Anonymous group failed... and way too many people are trying to kill him.

<p><i>One year into being a vampire, Bob must overcome his own addictions, misconceptions and screwed-up expectations as he comes to terms with being an instant outcast in vampire society, where most vampires are attractive trust-fund kiddies who can actually afford the vampire lifestyle.</i></p>
<p><i>Still forced to work his lousy day job at the porn-shop, he makes observations on everyday life, the inability to fly or anything useful like in the books, and dives into finding out just how far he can push the limits in his new life after dark without screwing everything up.</i></p>

<p><b>Let's make a bestselling series!</b> I believe that there is an audience hungry for this kind of vampire novel which takes all of the usual tropes of vampire books and strips them down to the core.  The romantic vampire is all we see in popular fiction and yes, those guys do exist, but in this book, our ""hero"" is an ordinary guy.  I mean just look at his name: Bob.  It says it all right there.  Bob is just like you and me, and as a result, when he gets turned into a vampire, he's not all powerful and charming.  </p>
<p>Nope! He screws it all up and almost gets himself killed many times over… but manages to keep his sense of humour through the whole thing.  He's only been a vampire for a year, and he takes us on his journey into the world of the vampires who could live right in your city.  Bob exposes some of the myths and why they couldn't possibly ever work and he's honest and relatable.  He cusses and screams, isn't trying to be a hero and is pining after his ex-girlfriend Jaime, who wants nothing to do with him.  You know this guy, the guy who crashes on your couch and will do almost anything for you… but he just happens to be a vampire.  </p>
<p>That's what makes this story so different.  It's brutally honest, sarcastically funny, filled with profanity, and it's just a bitching good read.</p>

""SO YOU MIGHT BE A VAMPIRE"" PRINT EDITION SERIES & EBOOKS
Nobody told Bob that when he became a vampire, he would still have to keep his job at the porn-shop. Foul-mouthed, sarcastically funny, Bob is completely new to the whole vampire life. His ex-girlfriend hates him, he's addicted to blood, his Vampires Anonymous group failed... and way too many people are trying to kill him. There are over 101 ways to suck at being a vampire, and Bob is living proof.
One year into being a vampire, Bob must overcome his own addictions, misconceptions and screwed-up expectations as he comes to terms with being an instant outcast in vampire society, where most vampires are attractive trust-fund kiddies who can actually afford the vampire lifestyle.
Still forced to work his lousy day job at the porn-shop, he makes observations on everyday life, the inability to fly or anything useful like in the books, and dives into finding out just how far he can push the limits in his new life after dark without screwing everything up.

A month ago I released SO YOU MIGHT BE A VAMPIRE as an eBook on iBooks and Smashwords, and within a couple of days the book had landed on the hotlist for Fantasy.  A few days after that the book reached #1 Top Free Book in Contemporary Fantasy. The best thing about this campaign is that the book is already completed and edited, and available to download absolutely free! 









PRE-ORDER THE PRINT EDITIONS


I've gotten a lot of requests for a physical book, so that's what I'm making available. Using Amazon CreateSpace for the softcover and Lulu.com for the hardcover, I've been able to put together a great looking and professionally formatted printed copy of the novel.  As a bonus, I've also created special covers for each edition of the book, one of which will be exclusive to backers of this campaign.
""...a Hilarious read and a Offbeat Great story"" - Ojube



And you can also pre-order the second book in the series of three ""SO YOU MIGHT BE HUMAN"" which will be completed for print in February 2015.  It's what I like to call the ""action movie"" of the series.  So You Might be Human picks up with Bob, minutes after the end of So You Might Be a Vampire.  Bob reunites with his best friend Claude, acting on a tip to end the threat of his nemesis-yes-it's-complicated-ex-girlfriend Beatrice once and for all.  Of course, nothing goes to plan and Bob ends up face to face with his lost love Jaime… but Bob is forced to make a choice to save Jaime's life… 



DOWNLOAD THE FREE EBOOK HERE




Let's make a bestselling series! I believe that there is an audience hungry for this kind of vampire novel which takes all of the usual tropes of vampire books and strips them down to the core.  The romantic vampire is all we see in popular fiction and yes, those guys do exist, but in this book, our ""hero"" is an ordinary guy.  I mean just look at his name: Bob.  It says it all right there.  Bob is just like you and me, and as a result, when he gets turned into a vampire, he's not all powerful and charming.  
Nope! He screws it all up and almost gets himself killed many times over… but manages to keep his sense of humour through the whole thing.  He's only been a vampire for a year, and he takes us on his journey into the world of the vampires who could live right in your city.  Bob exposes some of the myths and why they couldn't possibly ever work and he's honest and relatable.  He cusses and screams, isn't trying to be a hero and is pining after his ex-girlfriend Jaime, who wants nothing to do with him.  You know this guy, the guy who crashes on your couch and will do almost anything for you… but he just happens to be a vampire.  
That's what makes this story so different.  It's brutally honest, sarcastically funny, filled with profanity, and it's just a bitching good read.


I believe in ""So You Might Be a Vampire"" so much I've made it available for free to read, banking on the support of fans. So what do I want? I want you to download the book and read it and pass the word along.  I believe so strongly that you will like it, that I'm gifting the ebook to you, knowing you will appreciate the gritty, sophisticated, dark, and hilarious read, and want to invest in the series' future success.  

You can do this in a few ways:

<h3>
L'essentiel du projet</h3>
<p><i><b>Kurz zusammengefasst</b></i></p>
<p>Pour leur deuxième livre, les éditions À verse se tournent vers le théâtre et choisissent de faire paraître <em>Manèges de Clément Labail, une pièce originale, rythmée et poétique. Le livre paraîtra au début de 2015 sous forme bilingue (texte original en français et traduction en allemand), forme qui correspond à l'identité de cette pièce, jouée par la compagnie franco-allemande de l'auteur, tantôt dans une langue, tantôt dans l'autre.</em></p>
<p>Nous vous invitons dès maintenant à soutenir la parution de ce livre !</p>
<p><i>Das zweite Buch, das der Verlag A verse herausgeben wird, ist ein Theatertext: “Manèges” von Clément Labail. Originell, poetisch, rythmisch. Das Buch wird Anfang 2015 in einer zweisprachigen Ausgabe (Ursprungstext auf Französisch, Übersetzung auf Deutsch) veröffentlicht. Die Zweisprachigkeit passt zur Identität dieses Stückes, welches von der vom Autor gegründeten deutsch-französischen Theatergruppe Au fil des nuages in beiden Sprachen inszeniert und aufgeführt wurde.</i></p>
<p><i>Seien Sie dabei und unterstützen Sie schon jetzt die Veröffentlichung des Buches!</i></p>
<h3>
<em>Manèges</em> : un nouveau défi pour les éditions A verse</h3>
<p><em>À verse</em> est une association loi 1901 qui édite une revue semestrielle de poésie depuis 2008, désormais ancrée dans le paysage de la jeune poésie contemporaine et reconnue par ses pairs. À ce titre, elle est invitée et participe régulièrement à de très nombreux salons du livre et de poésie dans toute la France, et est distribuée en France et en Europe.</p>
<p><span><i>A verse hat sich als Association 1901 (gemeinnütziger, eingetragener Verein nach dem Gesetz des 1.Juli 1901) in Frankreich gegründet und bringt seit 2008 halbjährlich eine Literaturzeitschrift heraus. Inzwischen ist sie in der jungen zeitgenössischen Poesielandschaft anerkannt. Sie wird oft zu zahlreichen Literatur- und Poesiefachmessen eingeladen und in ganz Frankreich und Europa vertrieben. </i></span><br/></p>
<p><span>En 2012, forte du soutien de nombreux professionnels, poètes et universitaires, elle a décidé de créer sa propre maison d’édition avec la parution d'un premier titre, <em><em><em>Piliers</em></em></em>, premier recueil de poèmes d'Alena Meas.</span></p>
<p><span><span><i>Ermutigt durch zahlreiche Fachleute, Dichter und Doktoranten wurde aus A verse ein Verlag. Das erste Buch “Piliers”, der erste Gedichtband von Alena Meas.</i></span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Le projet de l'édition de <em>Manèges</em> de Clément Labail est un projet de longue date qui nous tient à cœur. La
publication de ce texte met en effet en œuvre l’objectif principal de notre
maison d’édition, à savoir <strong>soutenir la jeune création et ses
auteurs</strong>, pour lesquels il est souvent difficile de trouver une
concrétisation éditoriale, même avec des manuscrits de qualité.
Publier <i>Manèges</i>
est donc pour nous un moyen de permettre de faire entendre une des
nouvelles voix dramaturgiques du paysage contemporain. Forte de
l’expérience de la représentation par l’auteur – également
comédien – et sa compagnie, cette pièce trouve aujourd’hui
grâce à l’édition un chemin de renouveau servi par un texte
pleinement abouti et ainsi la possibilité d’une recréation
scénique accompagnée par une <strong>diffusion textuelle concrète</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><i>Seit langem ist es uns ein Anliegen, das Stück “Manèges” von Clément Labail zu veröffentlichen. Wichtiger Ansatz bei unserer Arbeit ist,  <b>junge Autoren zu unterstützen</b> und zu fördern. Diese Veröffentlichung gibt uns die Gelegenheit, den neuen dramaturgischen Stimmen einen Platz zu geben. Mit dem Hintergrund der Inszenierung durch das Théâtre Au fil des nuages findet dieses Stück im Zuge der Veröffentlichung eine ausgereifte Form, welche von der Neuinszenierung begleitet wird.</i><br/></span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p>Une
autre originalité de cet ouvrage, comme le premier livre paru dans notre maison, est sa <strong>présentation
bilingue</strong>, comportant le texte original en français et sa
traduction en allemand. Il nous est en effet apparu que cette pièce
était née dans le cœur de la compagnie de théâtre
franco-allemande de l’auteur, Au fil des nuages, et que le sens dramaturgique de la
pièce ne résidait pas seulement dans son texte original, mais bien
aussi dans le bilinguisme des représentations exécutées devant un
public souvent franco-allemand. Ainsi, l’édition devant refléter
un travail dramaturgique possible, le dialogue entre ces deux langues
cousines nous a paru être un élément essentiel de la publication,
en particulier dans le contexte européen qui est aujourd’hui le
nôtre : les habitants de nos pays, nos marchandises circulent
et s’échangent, mais aussi la parole littéraire.</p>
<p><i>Eine weitere Besonderheit, wie auch beim ersten in unserem Verlag veröffentlichten Buch, ist <b>der zweisprachige Aspekt</b>, mit dem Originaltext auf Französisch und seiner deutschen Übersetzung. Uns scheint es, dass das Erschaffen des Textes von Manèges Kern des vom Autoren mitbegründeten deutsch-französischen Theaters, Au fil des nuages, ist, dass die dramaturgische Bedeutung des Stücks nicht ausschließlich in dem orginellen Text liegt, sondern auch in der Zweisprachigkeit der vor deutschem und französischem Publikum aufgeführten Stücke. Die zweisprachige Edition spiegelt einen möglichen dramaturgischen Weg wieder. Der Dialog zwischen zwei verwandten Sprachen schien uns ein essentieller Bestandteil der Veröffentlichung zu sein, besonders im aktuellen europäischen Kontext:  Menschen reisen von einem Land ins andere, die Waren reisen über Ländergrenzen hinweg, und so auch die Literatur.</i><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Présentation de la pièce</strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>
En résumé :</strong> 
Maria et Pierre sont
deux clowns, deux forains de second rang. Ils s'occupent d'un manège,
font des numéros pour les enfants. Mais elle en a assez. Elle a
envie de changer les choses, que ça bouge. Lui, il prend la fuite.
Il entend prendre son temps, profiter de la vie, se la couler
douce... Alors ils se disputent, et ça chauffe ! Leur prise de bec
va trouver une issue insolite dont les spectateurs seront les témoins
privilégiés.
</p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b><i>Das Stück : </i></b></span><i>Maria und Pierre, privat ein Paar, Kollegen bei der Arbeit, sind zwei Schausteller. Sie betreiben ein Karussell und veranstalten kleine Zirkusnummern für Kinder… Doch Maria hat davon genug. Sie möchte ein neues Leben, mehr Geld zum Reisen und zur Erfüllung Ihrer Träume. Er aber bewegt sich nicht vom Fleck: ein Sandkastenpoet, zufrieden mit seinem Leben; einer, der sich lieber Zeit lässt, das Leben genießt und eine ruhige Kugel schiebt. So kommt es zu einer heftigen Auseinandersetzung. Die Fetzen fliegen… Da sie sich aber lieben und im Grunde dieselben Wünsche teilen, findet der Disput einen ungeahnten Ausgang, dessen priviligierter und tatkräftiger Zeuge das Publikum sein wird.</i></p>
<p>La pièce, sans
subdivisions, se déroule d’un trait, reflet littéraire et
dramatique d’une action non divisée, malgré les obstacles entre
les deux personnages. Un seul rêve, un voyage, une aspiration
humaine.</p>
<p>
Et pourtant, les
répliques rebondissent, détournent, divaguent, s’envolent et cela
donne un effet de tourbillons, de manèges qui s’arrêtent et
repartent de plus belle, voire de cercles – d’où la traduction
du titre français <i>Manèges</i>
en <i>Kreise</i>
en allemand – qui tournoient, s’élargissent et s’ouvrent vers
d’autres.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span><i>Das Stück entwickelt sich ohne Unterbrechungen oder Zeitsprünge und spiegelt somit eine kontinuierliche Handlung wieder. Trotz der Hindernisse, die die beiden Figuren zu überwinden haben, bleibt da ein einziger Traum, eine Reise, ein Wunsch.</i></span></p>
<i>Und dennoch, die Dialoge wirbeln, kreisen umeinander, stoßen aneinander, treiben ab. Kreise – so der deutsche Titel Manèges – die sich umeinander drehen, und sich für neue Horizonte öffnen.</i>
</div><div>
<i><br/></i><p>Sous-titrée
« fantaisie », la pièce met en scène la question de la
liberté dans tous ses états. La fantaisie est d’abord
thématique : des personnages capricieux, de la famille des
fantaisistes de cabaret, qui racontent des histoires en tous genres,
dans un vocabulaire fleuri qui ne ménage pas les calembours. Bien
vite, le mot de « fantaisie » dérive vers le sens de son
cousin allemand d’« imagination ». Les personnages, en
effet, rêvent d’un ailleurs, d’un autrement et, par leurs
divagations successives, emmènent le spectateur dans un voyage
burlesque et poétique où tout est envisageable, où les mots
prennent chair pour devenir lien entre des êtres qui se cherchent un
rêve commun.<br/></p>
<p><span><i>Der Untertitel « Ein Stück Fantasie » zeigt, dass es um die Freiheit in all ihren Zuständen und Ausdrucksweisen geht. Das Fantastische ist zunächst thematisch: etwas eigenwillige Figuren, entschlüpft aus der Welt des Kabaretts, die ganz verschiedene Geschichten in blumiger Sprache erzählen - auch Kalauer kommen nicht zu kurz. Schnell jedoch nimmt das Wort “Fantasie” die Bedeutung seines deutschen Cousins an: “Vorstellungskraft”. Die Figuren träumen von einem “Anderswo”, einem “Anders” und  nehmen die Zuschauer auf eine poetische Reise mit, wo alles möglich ist, wo die Wort einen Körper finden und zur Verbindung zwischen den beiden Figuren werden, die sich suchen, einander und einen gemeinsamen Traum suchen.</i></span><br/></p>

<h3>A quoi sert cet appel à souscription et aux dons ?</h3>
<div>
<span><b><i>Wozu dient dieses Crowdfunding?</i></b></span><br/>
</div>
<p>La somme que nous avons fixée comme objectif recouvre <strong>uniquement les frais d'impression du livre</strong>, ce qui est la <strong>condition sine qua non pour la parution</strong> de celui-ci, et ce, dans les meilleures conditions possibles. Le tirage de ce livre bilingue de 120 pages est prévu à 400 exemplaires, en impression offset avec deux illustrations intérieures en couleur, dans un format de 22 x 19 cm. Son prix de vente à parution s'élèvera à 18 €.</p>
<p><span><i>Die Zielsumme dient dazu, die Druckkosten zu decken, also, die Grundlage für die Veröffentlichung - und zwar um eine bestmögliche Qualität zu erzielen. 120 Seiten,  400 Exemplare, offset-Druck, inklusive zwei Illustrationen, im Format: 22 x 19 cm. 18 € wird das Buch danach kosten.</i></span><br/></p>
<p>Si nous atteignons cet objectif, les sommes récoltées après cet appel à souscription par la vente de l'ouvrage nous permettront de pouvoir envisager un peu plus sereinement d'autres projets de livre de cette envergure et d'enrichir ainsi la catalogue des éditions A verse. Soutenir ce livre dès maintenant, c'est donc <strong>soutenir également la vie à venir de notre maison d'édition</strong>.</p>
<p><i>Wenn wir das Ziel erreichen und das Buch gut verkaufen, wird es uns weiterhin <b>unseren Verlag und sein Weiterbestehen  unterstützen</b>.</i><br/></p>
<p>En revanche, si nous n'atteignons pas l'objectif fixé, nous serons contraints d'alléger le cahier des charges de la réalisation de ce livre et de proposer une facture de moindre qualité. Or, nous souhaitons vraiment pouvoir <strong>mettre en valeur le travail de l'auteur, de sa traductrice ainsi que de l'illustratrice par un livre de belle facture, ce qui contribuera aussi à faciliter sa diffusion</strong>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Sollten wir dieses Ziel jedoch nicht erreichen, müssen muss das Buch in geringerer Zahl und in wesentlich geringerer Qualität gedruckt werden. Wir möchten jedoch <b>die Arbeit  des Autoren, der Übersetzerin sowie der Illustratorin durch ein schönes Objekt wertschätzen</b>.</i></p>
<p>Quoi qu'il en soit, étant donné notre statut associatif, <strong>tous les dons supérieurs au prix de souscription, soit 15 €, sont déductibles des impôts à 66 %, déduction faite du prix de souscription du livre</strong>. Dans ce cas, vous recevrez un reçu fiscal de l'association au moment de l'envoi des contreparties.</p>
<p>Bien entendu, tous ceux qui auront aidé à la parution du livre seront conviés à une belle <strong>soirée de lancement </strong>du livre à Paris.<br/></p>

Kurz zusammengefasst
Pour leur deuxième livre, les éditions À verse se tournent vers le théâtre et choisissent de faire paraître Manèges de Clément Labail, une pièce originale, rythmée et poétique. Le livre paraîtra au début de 2015 sous forme bilingue (texte original en français et traduction en allemand), forme qui correspond à l'identité de cette pièce, jouée par la compagnie franco-allemande de l'auteur, tantôt dans une langue, tantôt dans l'autre.
Nous vous invitons dès maintenant à soutenir la parution de ce livre !
Das zweite Buch, das der Verlag A verse herausgeben wird, ist ein Theatertext: “Manèges” von Clément Labail. Originell, poetisch, rythmisch. Das Buch wird Anfang 2015 in einer zweisprachigen Ausgabe (Ursprungstext auf Französisch, Übersetzung auf Deutsch) veröffentlicht. Die Zweisprachigkeit passt zur Identität dieses Stückes, welches von der vom Autor gegründeten deutsch-französischen Theatergruppe Au fil des nuages in beiden Sprachen inszeniert und aufgeführt wurde.
Seien Sie dabei und unterstützen Sie schon jetzt die Veröffentlichung des Buches!

Manèges : un nouveau défi pour les éditions A verse
À verse est une association loi 1901 qui édite une revue semestrielle de poésie depuis 2008, désormais ancrée dans le paysage de la jeune poésie contemporaine et reconnue par ses pairs. À ce titre, elle est invitée et participe régulièrement à de très nombreux salons du livre et de poésie dans toute la France, et est distribuée en France et en Europe.
A verse hat sich als Association 1901 (gemeinnütziger, eingetragener Verein nach dem Gesetz des 1.Juli 1901) in Frankreich gegründet und bringt seit 2008 halbjährlich eine Literaturzeitschrift heraus. Inzwischen ist sie in der jungen zeitgenössischen Poesielandschaft anerkannt. Sie wird oft zu zahlreichen Literatur- und Poesiefachmessen eingeladen und in ganz Frankreich und Europa vertrieben. 
En 2012, forte du soutien de nombreux professionnels, poètes et universitaires, elle a décidé de créer sa propre maison d’édition avec la parution d'un premier titre, Piliers, premier recueil de poèmes d'Alena Meas.
Ermutigt durch zahlreiche Fachleute, Dichter und Doktoranten wurde aus A verse ein Verlag. Das erste Buch “Piliers”, der erste Gedichtband von Alena Meas.
Le projet de l'édition de Manèges de Clément Labail est un projet de longue date qui nous tient à cœur. La
publication de ce texte met en effet en œuvre l’objectif principal de notre
maison d’édition, à savoir soutenir la jeune création et ses
auteurs, pour lesquels il est souvent difficile de trouver une
concrétisation éditoriale, même avec des manuscrits de qualité.
Publier Manèges
est donc pour nous un moyen de permettre de faire entendre une des
nouvelles voix dramaturgiques du paysage contemporain. Forte de
l’expérience de la représentation par l’auteur – également
comédien – et sa compagnie, cette pièce trouve aujourd’hui
grâce à l’édition un chemin de renouveau servi par un texte
pleinement abouti et ainsi la possibilité d’une recréation
scénique accompagnée par une diffusion textuelle concrète.

Seit langem ist es uns ein Anliegen, das Stück “Manèges” von Clément Labail zu veröffentlichen. Wichtiger Ansatz bei unserer Arbeit ist,  junge Autoren zu unterstützen und zu fördern. Diese Veröffentlichung gibt uns die Gelegenheit, den neuen dramaturgischen Stimmen einen Platz zu geben. Mit dem Hintergrund der Inszenierung durch das Théâtre Au fil des nuages findet dieses Stück im Zuge der Veröffentlichung eine ausgereifte Form, welche von der Neuinszenierung begleitet wird.


Une
autre originalité de cet ouvrage, comme le premier livre paru dans notre maison, est sa présentation
bilingue, comportant le texte original en français et sa
traduction en allemand. Il nous est en effet apparu que cette pièce
était née dans le cœur de la compagnie de théâtre
franco-allemande de l’auteur, Au fil des nuages, et que le sens dramaturgique de la
pièce ne résidait pas seulement dans son texte original, mais bien
aussi dans le bilinguisme des représentations exécutées devant un
public souvent franco-allemand. Ainsi, l’édition devant refléter
un travail dramaturgique possible, le dialogue entre ces deux langues
cousines nous a paru être un élément essentiel de la publication,
en particulier dans le contexte européen qui est aujourd’hui le
nôtre : les habitants de nos pays, nos marchandises circulent
et s’échangent, mais aussi la parole littéraire.
Eine weitere Besonderheit, wie auch beim ersten in unserem Verlag veröffentlichten Buch, ist der zweisprachige Aspekt, mit dem Originaltext auf Französisch und seiner deutschen Übersetzung. Uns scheint es, dass das Erschaffen des Textes von Manèges Kern des vom Autoren mitbegründeten deutsch-französischen Theaters, Au fil des nuages, ist, dass die dramaturgische Bedeutung des Stücks nicht ausschließlich in dem orginellen Text liegt, sondern auch in der Zweisprachigkeit der vor deutschem und französischem Publikum aufgeführten Stücke. Die zweisprachige Edition spiegelt einen möglichen dramaturgischen Weg wieder. Der Dialog zwischen zwei verwandten Sprachen schien uns ein essentieller Bestandteil der Veröffentlichung zu sein, besonders im aktuellen europäischen Kontext:  Menschen reisen von einem Land ins andere, die Waren reisen über Ländergrenzen hinweg, und so auch die Literatur.

Présentation de la pièce



En résumé : 
Maria et Pierre sont
deux clowns, deux forains de second rang. Ils s'occupent d'un manège,
font des numéros pour les enfants. Mais elle en a assez. Elle a
envie de changer les choses, que ça bouge. Lui, il prend la fuite.
Il entend prendre son temps, profiter de la vie, se la couler
douce... Alors ils se disputent, et ça chauffe ! Leur prise de bec
va trouver une issue insolite dont les spectateurs seront les témoins
privilégiés.


Das Stück : Maria und Pierre, privat ein Paar, Kollegen bei der Arbeit, sind zwei Schausteller. Sie betreiben ein Karussell und veranstalten kleine Zirkusnummern für Kinder… Doch Maria hat davon genug. Sie möchte ein neues Leben, mehr Geld zum Reisen und zur Erfüllung Ihrer Träume. Er aber bewegt sich nicht vom Fleck: ein Sandkastenpoet, zufrieden mit seinem Leben; einer, der sich lieber Zeit lässt, das Leben genießt und eine ruhige Kugel schiebt. So kommt es zu einer heftigen Auseinandersetzung. Die Fetzen fliegen… Da sie sich aber lieben und im Grunde dieselben Wünsche teilen, findet der Disput einen ungeahnten Ausgang, dessen priviligierter und tatkräftiger Zeuge das Publikum sein wird.
La pièce, sans
subdivisions, se déroule d’un trait, reflet littéraire et
dramatique d’une action non divisée, malgré les obstacles entre
les deux personnages. Un seul rêve, un voyage, une aspiration
humaine.

Et pourtant, les
répliques rebondissent, détournent, divaguent, s’envolent et cela
donne un effet de tourbillons, de manèges qui s’arrêtent et
repartent de plus belle, voire de cercles – d’où la traduction
du titre français Manèges
en Kreise
en allemand – qui tournoient, s’élargissent et s’ouvrent vers
d’autres.

Das Stück entwickelt sich ohne Unterbrechungen oder Zeitsprünge und spiegelt somit eine kontinuierliche Handlung wieder. Trotz der Hindernisse, die die beiden Figuren zu überwinden haben, bleibt da ein einziger Traum, eine Reise, ein Wunsch.
Und dennoch, die Dialoge wirbeln, kreisen umeinander, stoßen aneinander, treiben ab. Kreise – so der deutsche Titel Manèges – die sich umeinander drehen, und sich für neue Horizonte öffnen.

Sous-titrée
« fantaisie », la pièce met en scène la question de la
liberté dans tous ses états. La fantaisie est d’abord
thématique : des personnages capricieux, de la famille des
fantaisistes de cabaret, qui racontent des histoires en tous genres,
dans un vocabulaire fleuri qui ne ménage pas les calembours. Bien
vite, le mot de « fantaisie » dérive vers le sens de son
cousin allemand d’« imagination ». Les personnages, en
effet, rêvent d’un ailleurs, d’un autrement et, par leurs
divagations successives, emmènent le spectateur dans un voyage
burlesque et poétique où tout est envisageable, où les mots
prennent chair pour devenir lien entre des êtres qui se cherchent un
rêve commun.
Der Untertitel « Ein Stück Fantasie » zeigt, dass es um die Freiheit in all ihren Zuständen und Ausdrucksweisen geht. Das Fantastische ist zunächst thematisch: etwas eigenwillige Figuren, entschlüpft aus der Welt des Kabaretts, die ganz verschiedene Geschichten in blumiger Sprache erzählen - auch Kalauer kommen nicht zu kurz. Schnell jedoch nimmt das Wort “Fantasie” die Bedeutung seines deutschen Cousins an: “Vorstellungskraft”. Die Figuren träumen von einem “Anderswo”, einem “Anders” und  nehmen die Zuschauer auf eine poetische Reise mit, wo alles möglich ist, wo die Wort einen Körper finden und zur Verbindung zwischen den beiden Figuren werden, die sich suchen, einander und einen gemeinsamen Traum suchen.

A quoi sert cet appel à souscription et aux dons ?

Wozu dient dieses Crowdfunding?

La somme que nous avons fixée comme objectif recouvre uniquement les frais d'impression du livre, ce qui est la condition sine qua non pour la parution de celui-ci, et ce, dans les meilleures conditions possibles. Le tirage de ce livre bilingue de 120 pages est prévu à 400 exemplaires, en impression offset avec deux illustrations intérieures en couleur, dans un format de 22 x 19 cm. Son prix de vente à parution s'élèvera à 18 €.
Die Zielsumme dient dazu, die Druckkosten zu decken, also, die Grundlage für die Veröffentlichung - und zwar um eine bestmögliche Qualität zu erzielen. 120 Seiten,  400 Exemplare, offset-Druck, inklusive zwei Illustrationen, im Format: 22 x 19 cm. 18 € wird das Buch danach kosten.
Si nous atteignons cet objectif, les sommes récoltées après cet appel à souscription par la vente de l'ouvrage nous permettront de pouvoir envisager un peu plus sereinement d'autres projets de livre de cette envergure et d'enrichir ainsi la catalogue des éditions A verse. Soutenir ce livre dès maintenant, c'est donc soutenir également la vie à venir de notre maison d'édition.
Wenn wir das Ziel erreichen und das Buch gut verkaufen, wird es uns weiterhin unseren Verlag und sein Weiterbestehen  unterstützen.
En revanche, si nous n'atteignons pas l'objectif fixé, nous serons contraints d'alléger le cahier des charges de la réalisation de ce livre et de proposer une facture de moindre qualité. Or, nous souhaitons vraiment pouvoir mettre en valeur le travail de l'auteur, de sa traductrice ainsi que de l'illustratrice par un livre de belle facture, ce qui contribuera aussi à faciliter sa diffusion.

Sollten wir dieses Ziel jedoch nicht erreichen, müssen muss das Buch in geringerer Zahl und in wesentlich geringerer Qualität gedruckt werden. Wir möchten jedoch die Arbeit  des Autoren, der Übersetzerin sowie der Illustratorin durch ein schönes Objekt wertschätzen.
Quoi qu'il en soit, étant donné notre statut associatif, tous les dons supérieurs au prix de souscription, soit 15 €, sont déductibles des impôts à 66 %, déduction faite du prix de souscription du livre. Dans ce cas, vous recevrez un reçu fiscal de l'association au moment de l'envoi des contreparties.
Bien entendu, tous ceux qui auront aidé à la parution du livre seront conviés à une belle soirée de lancement du livre à Paris.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm looking to publish my second book, a comedic novel called The Hack, in spring. And while E-publication is free, I belive the most people, like myself, prefer the feel of a physical book in their hand and to get it from a brick and mortar neighborhood book store. That is the kind of publication I wish to be a part of because it is the world that I want to live in and that I believe others do as well.</p>
<p>However, rather than take part in the toxic atmosphere of the corporate publishing world, I'd prefer to publish The Hack independently <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/secretsandlies/x/71070"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">like I did with my debut book</a>, Secrets &amp; Lies. That way the book is funded by the people that will appreciate it most: its own audience.</p>
<p>This campaign will pre-sell the book and offer supplementary materials to fund The Hack's independent publication.</p>
<p><strong>The Book</strong></p>
<p>Hamilton Brownstone’s father died when he was six. At the funeral he met a strange, angry boy named Gardner: the brother from another family that neither he nor his mother had known about.</p>
<p>In the years since that meeting, Gardner won the lottery and has used the money on a campaign of self-destruction, largely through his hobby of applying for minimum wage jobs. His goal is rock-bottom, something he can't ever seem to pull off. Hamilton’s bigggest  accomplishment since their meeting is a job at a disco-themed hot dog counter.</p>
<p>Faced with no accomplishements of note, Hamilton has decided to live out the lives of famour writers in order to channel them and write a book.</p>
<p>However between his mother’s neediness, his girlfriend’s acting ambitions and his boss’s constant attempts to make him manager, Hamilton bizarrely decides  the only way he’ll be able to finish his book is in prison.</p>

The Book
Hamilton Brownstone’s father died when he was six. At the funeral he met a strange, angry boy named Gardner: the brother from another family that neither he nor his mother had known about.
In the years since that meeting, Gardner won the lottery and has used the money on a campaign of self-destruction, largely through his hobby of applying for minimum wage jobs. His goal is rock-bottom, something he can't ever seem to pull off. Hamilton’s bigggest  accomplishment since their meeting is a job at a disco-themed hot dog counter.
Faced with no accomplishements of note, Hamilton has decided to live out the lives of famour writers in order to channel them and write a book.
However between his mother’s neediness, his girlfriend’s acting ambitions and his boss’s constant attempts to make him manager, Hamilton bizarrely decides  the only way he’ll be able to finish his book is in prison.
And there’s only one person willing to help Hamilton end up there: his brother Gardner.

<h3>Que?</h3>
<p><strong>Don Pepe</strong> é unha obra pendurada no aire, referente puro diso que veñen a chamar a narración abismada, onde cada conto garda un novo no seu interior; de xeito que a estructura flúe sinuosa coma un río de camiño ao seu fin, que non e outro que o mar...</p>
<p>Unha novela que, ademais, foi finalista no Certame de Novela Do Peirao.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Pepe, mexicano por máis de sesenta anos, era un lector voraz de poesía galega. Atopábaa pueril, ignorante, aburrida e, por riba de todo, artificial. Con todo, non era quen de se deitar sen recitar algún verso deses poemas que non xulgaba separados dos seus poetas: xente nova de mans grandes e pel ennegrecida, mulleres abandonadas polas ocupacións dos maridos e a miseria da terra, nenos de escola, libre pensadores fracasados, ou pervertidos con sorte. Estaba seguro de que endexamais serían bos escritores e negábase a envexalos, malia lelos e estudalos dun xeito enfermizo.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Esta é a trama da novela, na que o seu personaxe principal, Pepiño, describe as lembranzas da súa Boborás natal, e a súa querenza pola súa lingua e a súa cultura, que levan a que queira ser escritor e novelar, versar e contar.</p>
<h3>Quen?</h3>
<p><strong>Do Peirao</strong> é unha editorial con vontade de cambio, de dar a alternativa a autores que non a atopan noutro lugar, con novas e refrescantes ideas como é o empregar unha campaña preventa para valorar a aceptación e viabilidade de cada título.</p>
<p>Deste xeito es ti, agora que te estás expondo como colaborar, o que decide se a obra que che presentamos verá a luz pasando a formar parte do noso catálogo... porque consideramos ao lector parte fundamental do proceso.</p>
<p>Hoxe presentámoste a <strong>Moncho Iglesias Míguez</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacido en 1974 en Vigo malia ser de Boborás, viviu en Irlanda, México, India, Palestina e China, onde exerceu como mestre e mantivo viva a súa creación literaria. Neses camiños escribiu ensaios como Os contos de animais na tradición oral palestina; poemarios como pedras de Plastilina, novelas como Tres cores: azul e traduciu tamén, entre outros a Mahmud Darwix, dende o árabe, a Etgar Keret, dende o hebreo, e a Randa Jarrar dende o inglés. Amais, colabora en Praza pública, Tempos Novos e Dorna, e na actualidade vive en Bangladesh dende onde fixo os seus últimos traballos literarios: a tradución dos poemas de Martín Códax ao hebreo e ao árabe.</p>
<h3>Por que?</h3>
<p>Por aquí un fragmento do texto como mostra:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Pouco se sabe da súa adolescencia. Os poucos datos fiables que aínda se conservan apuntan que foi un neno espelido e controvertido, amante dos animais tallados, e con espírito viaxeiro. Foi quizais esa fame de aventuras a que provocou que perdese o brazo esquerdo e que á vez alimentase a obsesión, que máis tarde se faría evidente, polos champiñóns e froitos do bosque.<br/>     Como no caso de calquera outro artista, a raíz das exposicións, de renome mundial, comezaron a estenderse biografías e datos persoais que moitas das veces non casan entre si. No caso da perda do brazo, hai dúas historias que repiten diversos historiadores refutados e que, polo tanto, cómpre ter en conta»</p>
<h3>Como?</h3>
<p>Para arrincar o proxecto fixámonos como obxectivo 840€; esta é a cantidade que recadariamos se ao redor de cincuenta mecenas se fixesen, cada cal, cun exemplar desta primeira edición.</p>

<h3>About Manfred and Julia</h3>
<p>Julia and Manfred are senior Arts Management majors. Both extremely passionate about self-confidence, diversity, and loving yourself, creating a magazine to promote self-love was the obvious choice for these artists.</p>
<p>While Julia uses fashion to express that one can be in love with themselves inside and out, Manfred is taking his love for diversity, social justice, and his passion for all aspects of art, to bring a unique twist to the traditional lifestyle magazine. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Daily Moda will cost $1,500 to get up and running. </p>
<ul>
<li>At just under $9.00 per month, we'll be purchasing our domain for a year for a total cost of $100.</li>
<li>Writing is a lot of work, and takes a special skill set, interest, and can be time-consuming. We'd love to pay all of our writers, and will set aside $900 at about 3 articles per week to get the best content out there to our readers.</li>
<li>Another $500 will be allotted towards online ads, such as Facebook and Instagram ads, as well as ads on other websites and popular blogs with high traffic. This will help drive traffic to our site, and help get our message of diversity and self-love out there.    </li>
<li>If we are not able to reach our goal, the money will still be put to good use, hosting our site being our main goal, and compensating writers being the next. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Confidence is something so many of us struggle with, or have struggled with, and Daily Moda wants people to feel that they are indeed beautiful in their own skin. Daily Moda wants its readers to know that there is beauty in being different, in being an artist, and in being exactly who you are.</p>
<p>Daily Moda also provides a creative outlet for people to be heard and appreciated, especially for those whose voices have not been heard as loudly as others. In a world filled with injustice, Daily Moda serves as a safe space and sanctuary for <strong>YOU</strong>. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Marketing a new fashion and lifestyle magazine is a great challenge. There is a lot of effort and time that goes into social media marketing, which will be our main form of communication for this online publication. Being a two-man band, our biggest challenge will be splitting up creating the magazine, running a business, and being marketers all at the same time. However, we are extremely confident that with your help, Daily Moda will succeed, and <strong>YOUR</strong> voices will be heard far and wide. </p>

</div></div>","About Manfred and Julia
Julia and Manfred are senior Arts Management majors. Both extremely passionate about self-confidence, diversity, and loving yourself, creating a magazine to promote self-love was the obvious choice for these artists.
While Julia uses fashion to express that one can be in love with themselves inside and out, Manfred is taking his love for diversity, social justice, and his passion for all aspects of art, to bring a unique twist to the traditional lifestyle magazine. 

What We Need & What You Get
Daily Moda will cost $1,500 to get up and running. 

At just under $9.00 per month, we'll be purchasing our domain for a year for a total cost of $100.
Writing is a lot of work, and takes a special skill set, interest, and can be time-consuming. We'd love to pay all of our writers, and will set aside $900 at about 3 articles per week to get the best content out there to our readers.
Another $500 will be allotted towards online ads, such as Facebook and Instagram ads, as well as ads on other websites and popular blogs with high traffic. This will help drive traffic to our site, and help get our message of diversity and self-love out there.    
If we are not able to reach our goal, the money will still be put to good use, hosting our site being our main goal, and compensating writers being the next.

<p>""We cannot wait for anyone else to make the difference, we must make the difference ourselves"". This was the thought on our mind when we decided to jump, head first, into social entrepreneurship at the age of 9 and 7. Our first business was a gigantic failure  but we learned a lot.

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Bruno</strong>, narrada en primera persona, se caracteriza por tener un tono directo y una prosa sencilla, llena de referencias al mundo clásico.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Una novela breve que se podría ubicar entre el dietario de ficción y el cuadro de costumbres. El protagonista, <i>alter ego</i> del escritor, es Bruno, un chaval que explica sus vivencias ―algunas cómicas, otras no tanto― que transcurren en el Carmelo, un barrio barcelonés que mira con cierto recelo la llegada de la antorcha olímpica.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy será el propio autor quien se presente.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Me llamo <strong>Benet Martín</strong>, nací en Barcelona (1978) y ejerzo profesor en el Instituto<em> Màrius Torres</em> de Lleida desde el año 2009. Hice mi primera incursión en el mundo editorial con el relato «Koré» (La<em> fuente de Mimir</em>, Ed. Faunos, 2008). Después recibí un premio <em>ex aequo</em> con el relato «El hombre que siempre leía» (X Premio la Miranda de Cuentos, 2011) y quedé finalista con los relatos «Calbolution» (I concurso de relatos cortos del Segrià, 2011) y «Caminos» (IX Premios literarios Homilías de Organyà, Ediciones Salòria, 2012).</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Le llamábamos el Tocha por el narizón que tenía. Al Matutano su boca le ocupaba media cara cuando reía. El Rana tenía ojos de anfibio. El Maikel vestía como Michael Jackson. Las piernas del Lobo eran todo pelo. El Fraggle se parecía a los muñecos de la conocida serie de televisión. El Muñeco Diabólico tenía la misma cara y altura que el protagonista de la película de miedo. A mí me llamaban el Ojos Tristes porque tenía unas ojeras muy marcadas. Al Monchi solo le faltaba tener enganchada en el culo la mano de un ventrílocuo para ser la copia exacta del famoso muñeco. El Huesitos era un saco de huesos, no tenía ni un gramo de grasa. También estaban el Rufus, el Napis, el Zruspa, el Foofur, el Gordo, el Sevillano, el Seto, el Chechu… La lista era interminable. Todo aquel que ponía los pies en el pasaje tenía un mote, era el documento que validaba tu presencia. Había niños de los que podías conocer su mote y, en cambio, ignorar por completo su nombre de pila. Y es que allí tu nombre cristiano no servía de nada, el pasaje era apto solo para paganos. El hecho de no tener mote en el pasaje significaba que: o bien eras persona non grata, o bien no existías»    </p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
<li>Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <i>Bruno</i><strong> </strong>que saldría después a la venta.</p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Benet Martín</strong> vea publicada su obra.</p>
<p>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

Después recibí un premio ex aequo con el relato «El hombre que siempre leía» (X Premio la Miranda de Cuentos, 2011) y quedé finalista con los relatos «Calbolution» (I concurso de relatos cortos del Segrià, 2011) y «Caminos» (IX Premios literarios Homilías de Organyà, Ediciones Salòria, 2012).
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«Le llamábamos el Tocha por el narizón que tenía. Al Matutano su boca le ocupaba media cara cuando reía. El Rana tenía ojos de anfibio. El Maikel vestía como Michael Jackson. Las piernas del Lobo eran todo pelo. El Fraggle se parecía a los muñecos de la conocida serie de televisión. El Muñeco Diabólico tenía la misma cara y altura que el protagonista de la película de miedo. A mí me llamaban el Ojos Tristes porque tenía unas ojeras muy marcadas. Al Monchi solo le faltaba tener enganchada en el culo la mano de un ventrílocuo para ser la copia exacta del famoso muñeco. El Huesitos era un saco de huesos, no tenía ni un gramo de grasa. También estaban el Rufus, el Napis, el Zruspa, el Foofur, el Gordo, el Sevillano, el Seto, el Chechu… La lista era interminable. Todo aquel que ponía los pies en el pasaje tenía un mote, era el documento que validaba tu presencia. Había niños de los que podías conocer su mote y, en cambio, ignorar por completo su nombre de pila. Y es que allí tu nombre cristiano no servía de nada, el pasaje era apto solo para paganos. El hecho de no tener mote en el pasaje significaba que: o bien eras persona non grata, o bien no existías»    
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de Bruno que saldría después a la venta.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Benet Martín vea publicada su obra.
Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

I've been spread pretty thin with the work of finishing my senior year as a Sociology major at San Francisco State University, getting things ready for graduation,  preparing myself for Graduate School, and other community-oriented projects (like coaching the Mills College CUPSI Slam Team). This is where I need your help and the help of my community, as it is important to invest in the lives and voices of working poor writers of color so that they may have access to spaces such as these. What you are able to contribute is not only about me realizing my own personal goals, but it is also a contribution to black voice in a time where violence committed against bodies that resemble my own are prevalent nationwide.

<p>As a queer woman of color writer, it is also not common for a voice like mine to be celebrated and upheld in mainstream discourse around socioeconomic inequity and police violence against black and brown bodies.

<p>Coming from meager means, it is hard to come up with enough money on my own to take this opportunity that has been afforded to me. So without community support, I won't be able to attend Callaloo. But with your help, I can guarantee this opportunity will help me grow in my work immensely. </p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Novela burlesca del siglo XXI.<i> Las Aventuras y Desventuras de un Diablo Cojo</i> es una sátira contemporánea de un mundo anclado en viejos moldes. Un recorrido por los siete pecados capitales, y algunos provincianos, que merecen ser tratados con irreverencia.

Una historia con una variada gama de brujos cantamañanas, demonios nauseabundos y seres angelicales que arrinconan en los burladeros de una inmensa plaza con forma de piel de toro.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi folks. My name's Al, and I'm a comedian, storyteller, touring artist, and haiku enthusiast. My solo theatre work has won some awards and garnered some pretty reviews, and none of it has anything to do with this project. This project is about my love of haikus. Well, technically, zappai, since they don't always follow traditional haiku rules.</p>
<p>Anyhow, here's the deal:</p>
<p><br/>For years, I've suffered from insomnia, and I've tried a lot of different pre-bedtime routines to try to get to sleep. None of them worked, but one of them became something that I do on the regular - writing haikus. Dumb haikus, mostly, but some more serious ones, and all of them straight from my black black heart. For this book, I have hand-picked over 120 of my favourite haiku creations, and recruited the amazing Jacob Trillo to illustrate a few of them. Samples of his works-in-progress are the featured images on this page.</p>
<p>With your help, I'd like to put forth this beautiful little book, and set it off into the world, to be ignored and forgotten by the masses - but not by you! (Potentially) (If you buy one) </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 
Hi folks. My name's Al, and I'm a comedian, storyteller, touring artist, and haiku enthusiast. My solo theatre work has won some awards and garnered some pretty reviews, and none of it has anything to do with this project. This project is about my love of haikus. Well, technically, zappai, since they don't always follow traditional haiku rules.
Anyhow, here's the deal:
For years, I've suffered from insomnia, and I've tried a lot of different pre-bedtime routines to try to get to sleep. None of them worked, but one of them became something that I do on the regular - writing haikus. Dumb haikus, mostly, but some more serious ones, and all of them straight from my black black heart. For this book, I have hand-picked over 120 of my favourite haiku creations, and recruited the amazing Jacob Trillo to illustrate a few of them. Samples of his works-in-progress are the featured images on this page.
With your help, I'd like to put forth this beautiful little book, and set it off into the world, to be ignored and forgotten by the masses - but not by you! (Potentially) (If you buy one)

<p><strong>Behind the book</strong></p>
<p>Last year, sat on the El Cap’s East Ledges descent, someone asked me how many days I’d spent up on big walls in my life. I did a quick count, my brain a bit fried after nineteen days soloing South Seas, thinking about the walls and faces, totting up the numbers on battered fingers. The rough answer was about three hundred days, maybe over a year if I included bivys and camps at the bases of walls. If I threw in just ‘being in the mountains’ then it would be twice as long. “You must understand rock at the granular level?” they said. I thought back to the last two weeks, where placing a cam or hook one millimetre either way would see me fall, taking a whip that may yank out piece after carefully placed piece, my body free-falling down the wall. “Yes - you’re probably right”.</p>
<p>I’ve climbed walls fast, sped up El Cap in a day, but really I’m a man who likes to take his time, believing in the Karma Sutra’s dictum that, “Whatever you’re doing, do it at half the speed”. When you take your time you have time to consider things, to get things right, to think of better ways rather than simply ‘the way’. Learning all the techniques necessary to climb big walls has become as much the kick of climbing as the climbing itself, to be able to scale not only clean and sunny walls, but cold and chossy ones too, any new wall just an excuse to learn new skills.</p>
<p>This obsession with climbing big walls has seen me spending many months living the high life, from thirty+ ascents of El Cap (including 5 solos, 2 one day ascents, 1 winter ascent), routes on the Troll Wall, Dru, Eiger, places like Patagonia, Zion, Alaska and Antarctica, five failures for every summit.</p>
<p>My solo climbs led to a lot of questions from climbers about that black art, and so led to the writing of Me, Myself and I, one of the few big wall soloing manuals around (maybe the only one?). When I wrote Me, Myself and I, I imagined it so niche that few would buy it, and gave it a heavy price tag to match. In the end I found there were many climbers who wanted this book, a good percentage who went on to solo walls with its help, but also many who just liked to know more stuff about the sport they love. Since then the number of questions about big walls has steadily increased, with at least one person a day asking me how to do something wall related, from small technical details to more expansive questions about motivation and getting it done.</p>
<p>At the moment there are a small number of dedicated big wall books, all excellent, but most were written over twenty years ago, and so tend to feature outdated ideas, advice, or are missing new cutting edge techniques. Another issue is that they tend to be limited in their detail due to the need to keep the book within reasonable cost, meaning the real nitty gritty, the granular stuff, tends to be missing, as books like this need to be sold for about £20, meaning much of the good stuff is left out (a war is won on details!). But climbers love the nitty gritty, like how to remove a beak without breaking it, drilling a rivet or bat hook, how to rig a portaledge in a storm or rig a parachute for a wildness retreat (on that last one, don’t buy a €19 parachute off eBay!). It’s often these little details that make or break a climb, not the big things.</p>

<p><strong>Based on a lifetime of numpties  </strong></p>
<p>Higher Education is not only based on my personal learning on many walls, but also from teaching hundreds of climbers how to climb big walls, from 5.14 climbers wanting to free El Cap, to 5.6 climbers who want to frig it all. Being able to take a highly complex set of skills and pass it on helps to create an approach to teaching that makes learning easy(ish), mainly by keeping it simple, and not overloading the pupil. Beyond this I’ve also taken many novice climbers up walls, people who were not even climbers, and taught them the skills to haul, clean and even lead. When you climb with novices, or people who are disabled, children, blind or ginger, you soon learn what’s important and what’s not.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the basics </strong></p>
<p>This book gives the climber access to all the skills needed to climb anything from alpine peg ladders to trade route walls, as well as jumaring and hauling and all the stuff you need to stay alive, but unlike other books it also goes into the more technical aspects of climbing, the extreme stuff of hooking, pegging, heading and loose and expanding rock.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond the sunny walls </strong></p>
<p>Higher Education is not simply a book looking at sun-drenched Californian walls (the best place to learn), but also colder, more stormy walls, where you may be dealing with ice and snow, killer storms and frigid bivys, where at the end your sleeping bag is more ice than insulation. These aspects of extreme big walling may seem beyond the realms of most end users of this book, but are ‘shitty fan’ concepts that could well prove valuable even on sunny walls!</p>
<p><strong>Just another instruction book? </strong></p>
<p>Higher Education, like Me,Myself &amp; I, is as much a story about big wall climbing as an instruction manual, full of personal stories and stories by others (I’m a big fan of learning by story).</p>

<p>* Me, Myself &amp; I is the most complete book on roped soloing around, and trying to cover soloing in this book would create a monster book, so I’ll only cover the very basics which can be employed by teams on a wall (short fixing, self rescue etc).</p>
<p><strong>Who’s this book for - only aid climbers? </strong></p>
<p>I’d buy this book for a start, but then I would, as I always try and write the types of books I’d like. Beyond that the book is written for both the experienced climber and novice, as well as the armchair big wall climber, who just wants to know about new and strange and exotic climbing techniques. The issues covered will be of great interest to free climbers looking to do new routes in alpine environments, alpinists who want to tackle routes that feature aid climbing, expeditionists who employ fixed ropes, and anyone who needs a bit of motivation for their own seemingly insurmountable objectives.</p>
<p><strong>The book </strong></p>
<p>The book itself will be printed by the same people who printed Me, Myself and I, and be a black and white soft back. This is not a coffee table book, but a cutting edge manual for big wall climbers. It’s hard to judge the overall size of the book but I expect it will be running to around 700 pages (brick thick).</p>
<p><strong>Price </strong></p>
<p>How much should such a book be? The most complete big wall book I ever bought was Chongo’s ground manual back in the 90’s, a telephone directory sized big wall guide that only dealt with the pre climb! This cost me $60 back in 1995, a price I was happy to pay, both eager for knowledge but also eager to help out the legendary Chongo. This book was simply photocopied pages with a green card cover yet every penny was well worth it, and in many ways, beyond big wall climbing, set me on a course to write my own books. The amount of work involved is considerable but the market itself is limited, and looking around at what else we buy every day, when compared to the value of this book, makes me think that a fair price is €45 (FREE P&amp;P for most customers ).  Sorry that prices are in Euros but I live in Ireland, so can't offer a dollar or sterling price.</p>
<p><strong>FREE shipping to Europe, US and Canada </strong></p>
<p>For European &amp; North American customers postage is FREE, but if you live outside this area there will be a small shipping cost when you pledge, as detailed in the boxes on the right (sorry).</p>
<p><strong>About the Author </strong></p>
<p>I’ve been climbing since the age of five, so that’s over forty years of scaring the shit out of myself! I’ve climbed around the world, both as a free climber (I don’t just aid climb!), mixed and ice climber, mountaineer and alpinist (one sleeps in a tent, the other on his mate’s knee) and explorer type (that means an expedition without any summits… which is also most mountaineering expeditions). Writing wise I’ve written quite a few books (Psychovertical, Cold Wars, 1000 Climbing Tips), which you can get in loads of funny languages and have also somehow won lots of prizes. No one ever told me the right way to write, or spell, so my style can be a little non-corporate, but people seem to like it. I also have one of the most popular indie climbing websites (andy-kirkpatrick.com), loved by climbers looking for tips and instruction on the climbing game.</p>

<h2><strong>The Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<i>RX: Earth, How a Healthy You Requires a Healthy Planet</i> is about the connections between climate change and human health. It examines how these connections form and what social institutions keep them in place.<br/><br/><i>RX: Earth</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to environmentally-curious people and anyone interested in health who are looking at climate change and personal health for the first time.<br/><br/>I wrote this book because I want to show people how climate change directly relates to their personal lives. My hope is that this book will provide knowledge on the hidden effects of climate change on our overall health and motivate people to take stronger actions to improve their lives by supporting our planet.<br/><br/>You will discover that climate change affects more than just the natural world, but also our health as human beings. In this book, my intention is to instill the same sort of passion and excitement in you that I have for climate change and its connection to our health. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you use your rights as a citizen and individual to make choices supporting environmental stability and security.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the many ways climate change is harming human health and how our social institutions are allowing it to continue this way such as:<p>How the contamination of our air and water is prolonging chronic disease</p>
<p>The dangers unpredictable weather poses to our food system and high-risk areas (think hurricanes and wildfires)</p>
<p>The effects climate change has on different sectors of society and social movements such as women's and minority rights</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in climate change, personal or public health, environmental activism, or the social institutions and movements that shape our society.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book - RX: Earth, How a Healthy You Requires a Healthy Planet</h3>The book is written in 3 Parts...<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 2 and 3. These chapters will focus on how the story of humanity has been shaped by changes in climate, from our cities to our diverse cultures to our very human evolution. For instance, did you know that all known periods of major species evolution have coincided with significant shifts in global climate?<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4-7. In these chapters, you’ll learn about how climate change is transforming our food, water, air, and weather patterns, and how these changing are threatening our health and wellness. They include stories about the hottest places on earth getting hotter by the year and the dangerous measures people are willing to take in order to protect their family and property in the face of extreme weather. Along with biological effects, there are sections on how climate change is impacting certain populations more than others such as women and the poor.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 8 and 9. These final chapters dive into the specific effects climate change is having on our social institutions along with how these very institutions are allowing climate change to continue. They examine the role of the media, corporations, and the government at all levels of society. However, it’s not all doom and gloom in these chapters. The ending highlights ways in that each level of society can reduce its carbon footprint<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Claire Hubley is a public health and digital media student at Tulane University. She’s been passionate about creating for as long as she can remember. Throughout her life, this passion has manifested herself in art, music, and now writing. Her goal is to use her creative skills to advance the movements she’s passionate about, such as environmentalism and climate change. <br/><br/>I wrote this book because I am passionate about stopping climate change and about helping people live their best lives using preventative health measures.

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","The Story of My Book
RX: Earth, How a Healthy You Requires a Healthy Planet is about the connections between climate change and human health. It examines how these connections form and what social institutions keep them in place.RX: Earth is a non-fiction book that speaks to environmentally-curious people and anyone interested in health who are looking at climate change and personal health for the first time.I wrote this book because I want to show people how climate change directly relates to their personal lives. My hope is that this book will provide knowledge on the hidden effects of climate change on our overall health and motivate people to take stronger actions to improve their lives by supporting our planet.You will discover that climate change affects more than just the natural world, but also our health as human beings. In this book, my intention is to instill the same sort of passion and excitement in you that I have for climate change and its connection to our health. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you use your rights as a citizen and individual to make choices supporting environmental stability and security.In this book, you'll learn about the many ways climate change is harming human health and how our social institutions are allowing it to continue this way such as:How the contamination of our air and water is prolonging chronic disease
The dangers unpredictable weather poses to our food system and high-risk areas (think hurricanes and wildfires)
The effects climate change has on different sectors of society and social movements such as women's and minority rights
You will love this book if you are interested in climate change, personal or public health, environmental activism, or the social institutions and movements that shape our society.

The Book - RX: Earth, How a Healthy You Requires a Healthy PlanetThe book is written in 3 Parts...Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 2 and 3. These chapters will focus on how the story of humanity has been shaped by changes in climate, from our cities to our diverse cultures to our very human evolution. For instance, did you know that all known periods of major species evolution have coincided with significant shifts in global climate?Part 2 contains Chapters 4-7. In these chapters, you’ll learn about how climate change is transforming our food, water, air, and weather patterns, and how these changing are threatening our health and wellness. They include stories about the hottest places on earth getting hotter by the year and the dangerous measures people are willing to take in order to protect their family and property in the face of extreme weather. Along with biological effects, there are sections on how climate change is impacting certain populations more than others such as women and the poor.Part 3 contains Chapters 8 and 9. These final chapters dive into the specific effects climate change is having on our social institutions along with how these very institutions are allowing climate change to continue. They examine the role of the media, corporations, and the government at all levels of society. However, it’s not all doom and gloom in these chapters. The ending highlights ways in that each level of society can reduce its carbon footprint What I Need & What You'll Get

As a sexual assault activist, I have been featured in Variety, Glamour, Cosmopolitan UK, and Jezebel, to name a few.I love writing and can’t imagine doing anything else. In so many ways and so many times, it has supported and healed me, but most of all, it allows me to write things with the intention of changing a narrative that silences those who suffer from the aftershocks of trauma every single day.THE LOW DOWN The VCFA retreat offers one week of uninterrupted writing time, private studios, mentorship, workshops, readings, food and lodging and an additional week to work on my memoir. Tuition for two weeks is $820 (including my scholarship), $580 for room and board, $500 for travel including airfare and transportation to and from airports, $800 to have an advisor read and give notes on my manuscript (this typically runs between $3-6K), and $3000 for rent and other expenses as I won't be able to work my other jobs while writing in Vermont. Any additional money will go to line editing, writing time and getting the memoir published.  The campaign is only running for 20 days as I was just accepted last Friday and the retreat begins May 15th. SHARING HEARTS CARING Please help me write my memoir while attending the VCFA Novel Retreat by making a donation and/or sharing this campaign by using the Indiegogo buttons or sending an email to your friends. (I'll even write it for you!) I am deeply humbled by those who have supported my writing. I couldn't have done any of this without you. Thank you for reading, sharing, and contributing whatever you can.  With love and gratitude,Marnie",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1577102328/pp2xkmzn77touqvre68g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Anni '70 del ventunesimo secolo.<br/>In un'America immaginaria in bilico tra la tecnologia e il degrado, gli esseri umani vivono a loro insaputa fianco a fianco col ""mondo invisibile"", un mondo popolato da creature non-umane appartenenti a differenti razze e culture.<br/>Per centinaia di anni la convivenza è proseguita pacifica e silenziosa... almeno fino a che una serie di brutali omicidi non ha improvvisamente iniziato a colpire la società dei non-umani, mettendo pericolosamente a rischio il suo equilibrio con gli umani.</p>
<p>Rinnaeh Vart è una saga urban-fantasy condita con tanto thriller e un pizzico di horror qua e là; il primo volume, Evil Heaven, ha visto la luce nel 2017 grazie a un crowdfounding supportato da molte meravigliose persone, senza le quali tutto questo non sarebbe stato altrimenti possibile.<br/>Adesso, a distanza di tre anni, il tanto atteso secondo volume della storia è finalmente pronto per la pubblicazione!<br/>Ritroverete personaggi già conosciuti come Art, Yurah e Ocean, ora costretti a fare i conti con le conseguenze di quanto accaduto a causa del Deus Ex Machina, e ne incontrerete di nuovi, arrivati per unirsi chi al fianco dei protagonisti, chi al fianco del nemico.<br/>Così come il primo volume, anche Chimera è sconsigliato a un pubblico minore di 16 anni per via delle molteplici scene esplicite di violenza e/o erotismo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>• Le copertine dei due volumi sono state realizzate dalla bravissima artista K I K I •</strong><br/>Seguitela e supportatela su: <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/kikikinchester/?hl=it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">INSTAGRAM</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/kiki.asuka.1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FACEBOOK</a> e <a href=""https://twitter.com/KikiKinchester"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TWITTER</a>.<br/> </p>
<p><br/><strong>Rinnaeh Vart, com'è nata la saga?</strong></p>
<p>Questa storia, la storia di Art e del mondo in cui vive, è nata nel lontano 2010 quando, dopo uno strano sogno che vedeva un anonimo ragazzino starsene in silenzio contro il muro di una discoteca, decisi di aprire Word e cominciare a scrivere.<br/>Misi in fila qualche frase, descrissi l'ambiente della discoteca così come lo ricordavo dal sogno, diedi a quell'anonimo ragazzino un nome e dei pensieri.<br/>Ben presto, arrivarono nuovi personaggi.<br/>Arrivarono Yurah Evans e Ocean Morgensen che, insieme ad Art, divennero il fulcro della storia. E con loro, in un attimo arrivarono anche i primi sviluppi.<br/>Creature dai poteri sovrannaturali.<br/>Uno spietato e misterioso assassino.<br/>Una scritta incomprensibile sul muro di casa di Art.<br/>Senza quasi rendermene conto, mi ritrovai fra le mani un mondo intero fatto di umani e non-umani, città fantastiche, creature sovrannaturali, corse contro il tempo e indagini disperate alla ricerca di un mostro che fa a pezzi le proprie vittime e ne ruba gli organi.<br/>Col passare degli anni ho raffinato il mio stile di scrittura, lavorato sul trattamento della storia e steso una sceneggiatura completa, sceneggiatura che si svilupperà in una saga composta da non meno di 7 volumi (e io che avevo iniziato a scrivere pensando a un volume unico).<br/>Tra i temi centrali della saga spiccano il sovrannaturale e la fantascienza, accompagnati da argomenti più profondi e delicati come la crescita emotiva dei personaggi e il loro relazionarsi a una società proiettata cinquant'anni circa nel futuro, negli anni '70 del ventunesimo secolo.</p>

<p><strong>Chi sono?</strong></p>
<p>CrazyKinoko (per gli amici semplicemente ""Kino"") è lo pseudonimo che uso come artista da ormai quasi dieci anni, è l'unione di una parola inglese (<i>crazy</i>) e una giapponese (<i>kinoko</i>) e letteralmente significa ""fungo pazzo"".<br/>Nasco nel '93 in provincia di Treviso. Dopo un'infanzia divisa fra il Veneto e l'Emilia Romagna, sbarco finalmente in Toscana dove completo i miei studi specializzandomi in fumetto manga e sceneggiatura. Qui mi stabilisco in pianta stabile trovando a Firenze la mia nuova casa.<br/>Lavoro come scrittore, fumettista e digital artist; sono co-autore del webcomic <i>“Looks Like Me” </i>insieme all’artista e grande amica KIKI, occasionalmente collaboro anche con collettivi e piccole realtà italiane e nel corso dell'ultimo anno ho iniziato un ulteriore percorso di studi come tatuatore.</p>
<p><strong>Perché iniziare a scrivere Rinnaeh Vart?</strong></p>
<p>Ho sempre amato leggere e ho sempre amato in particolare le storie che avessero del sovrannaturale nella trama. Fantasy, fantascenza, urban-fatasy... Mi sono nutrito di questo genere di storie fin da piccolo, trovando fra le loro pagine rifugio e ispirazione, nonché un modo totalmente differente ed elettrizzante di vivere la realtà che mi circondava. Ogni libro era (ed è tutt'ora) per me una sorta di temporanea vita parallela, un'avventura, la possibilità di vivere esperienze che altrimenti non incontrerei mai nella vita di tutti i giorni.<br/>Col tempo ho iniziato poi a maturare il desiderio di scrivere qualcosa che potesse emozionare le persone come i libri che leggevo emozionavano me. Un desiderio un po' ambizioso, forse, ma trovavo che il benessere datomi dalla letteratura fosse così prezioso da voler a tutti i costi provare a donare a mia volta quel benessere agli altri.<br/>E così la scrittura entrò nella mia vita.<br/>Divenne ben presto un tassello fondamentale del mio essere: non è solo il mio lavoro, non è solo una fortissima passione, ma anche un modo per esprimere me stesso e le mie emozioni attraverso i personaggi di cui racconto. Credo di poter affermare che la scrittura abbia su di me sono solo un effetto di sfogo, ma anche terapeutico.<br/>Dunque perché ho iniziato a scrivere Rinnaeh Vart?<br/>Per donare alle persone un luogo in più in cui rifugiarsi dalla realtà e per esplorare me stesso.<br/>Molti altri ""motori"" si sono attivati nel corso degli anni, fra cui il voler creare una saga che contenesse una rappresentazione della comunità LGBT+ che andasse oltre quegli stereotipi che purtroppo ancora molto spesso portano nella letteratura young adult un'immagine distorta di tutte quelle persone al di fuori dell'eterosessualità e della cisessualità.<br/>Essendo io stesso parte della comunità come non-binary, desidero scrivere una storia che abbia al suo interno più varietà possibile di orientamenti sessuali e di genere, in modo da poter dare agli altri giovani della comunità la possibilità di immedesimarsi in una saga in cui i contenuti LGBT+ siano integrati alle tematiche principali della trama.<br/> </p>

Anni '70 del ventunesimo secolo.In un'America immaginaria in bilico tra la tecnologia e il degrado, gli esseri umani vivono a loro insaputa fianco a fianco col ""mondo invisibile"", un mondo popolato da creature non-umane appartenenti a differenti razze e culture.Per centinaia di anni la convivenza è proseguita pacifica e silenziosa... almeno fino a che una serie di brutali omicidi non ha improvvisamente iniziato a colpire la società dei non-umani, mettendo pericolosamente a rischio il suo equilibrio con gli umani.
Rinnaeh Vart è una saga urban-fantasy condita con tanto thriller e un pizzico di horror qua e là; il primo volume, Evil Heaven, ha visto la luce nel 2017 grazie a un crowdfounding supportato da molte meravigliose persone, senza le quali tutto questo non sarebbe stato altrimenti possibile.Adesso, a distanza di tre anni, il tanto atteso secondo volume della storia è finalmente pronto per la pubblicazione!Ritroverete personaggi già conosciuti come Art, Yurah e Ocean, ora costretti a fare i conti con le conseguenze di quanto accaduto a causa del Deus Ex Machina, e ne incontrerete di nuovi, arrivati per unirsi chi al fianco dei protagonisti, chi al fianco del nemico.Così come il primo volume, anche Chimera è sconsigliato a un pubblico minore di 16 anni per via delle molteplici scene esplicite di violenza e/o erotismo.
 
• Le copertine dei due volumi sono state realizzate dalla bravissima artista K I K I •Seguitela e supportatela su: INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK e TWITTER. 
Rinnaeh Vart, com'è nata la saga?
Questa storia, la storia di Art e del mondo in cui vive, è nata nel lontano 2010 quando, dopo uno strano sogno che vedeva un anonimo ragazzino starsene in silenzio contro il muro di una discoteca, decisi di aprire Word e cominciare a scrivere.Misi in fila qualche frase, descrissi l'ambiente della discoteca così come lo ricordavo dal sogno, diedi a quell'anonimo ragazzino un nome e dei pensieri.Ben presto, arrivarono nuovi personaggi.Arrivarono Yurah Evans e Ocean Morgensen che, insieme ad Art, divennero il fulcro della storia. E con loro, in un attimo arrivarono anche i primi sviluppi.Creature dai poteri sovrannaturali.Uno spietato e misterioso assassino.Una scritta incomprensibile sul muro di casa di Art.Senza quasi rendermene conto, mi ritrovai fra le mani un mondo intero fatto di umani e non-umani, città fantastiche, creature sovrannaturali, corse contro il tempo e indagini disperate alla ricerca di un mostro che fa a pezzi le proprie vittime e ne ruba gli organi.Col passare degli anni ho raffinato il mio stile di scrittura, lavorato sul trattamento della storia e steso una sceneggiatura completa, sceneggiatura che si svilupperà in una saga composta da non meno di 7 volumi (e io che avevo iniziato a scrivere pensando a un volume unico).Tra i temi centrali della saga spiccano il sovrannaturale e la fantascienza, accompagnati da argomenti più profondi e delicati come la crescita emotiva dei personaggi e il loro relazionarsi a una società proiettata cinquant'anni circa nel futuro, negli anni '70 del ventunesimo secolo.
 
L'AUTORE
 

Chi sono?
CrazyKinoko (per gli amici semplicemente ""Kino"") è lo pseudonimo che uso come artista da ormai quasi dieci anni, è l'unione di una parola inglese (crazy) e una giapponese (kinoko) e letteralmente significa ""fungo pazzo"".Nasco nel '93 in provincia di Treviso. Dopo un'infanzia divisa fra il Veneto e l'Emilia Romagna, sbarco finalmente in Toscana dove completo i miei studi specializzandomi in fumetto manga e sceneggiatura. Qui mi stabilisco in pianta stabile trovando a Firenze la mia nuova casa.Lavoro come scrittore, fumettista e digital artist; sono co-autore del webcomic “Looks Like Me” insieme all’artista e grande amica KIKI, occasionalmente collaboro anche con collettivi e piccole realtà italiane e nel corso dell'ultimo anno ho iniziato un ulteriore percorso di studi come tatuatore.
Perché iniziare a scrivere Rinnaeh Vart?
Ho sempre amato leggere e ho sempre amato in particolare le storie che avessero del sovrannaturale nella trama. Fantasy, fantascenza, urban-fatasy... Mi sono nutrito di questo genere di storie fin da piccolo, trovando fra le loro pagine rifugio e ispirazione, nonché un modo totalmente differente ed elettrizzante di vivere la realtà che mi circondava. Ogni libro era (ed è tutt'ora) per me una sorta di temporanea vita parallela, un'avventura, la possibilità di vivere esperienze che altrimenti non incontrerei mai nella vita di tutti i giorni.Col tempo ho iniziato poi a maturare il desiderio di scrivere qualcosa che potesse emozionare le persone come i libri che leggevo emozionavano me. Un desiderio un po' ambizioso, forse, ma trovavo che il benessere datomi dalla letteratura fosse così prezioso da voler a tutti i costi provare a donare a mia volta quel benessere agli altri.E così la scrittura entrò nella mia vita.Divenne ben presto un tassello fondamentale del mio essere: non è solo il mio lavoro, non è solo una fortissima passione, ma anche un modo per esprimere me stesso e le mie emozioni attraverso i personaggi di cui racconto. Credo di poter affermare che la scrittura abbia su di me sono solo un effetto di sfogo, ma anche terapeutico.Dunque perché ho iniziato a scrivere Rinnaeh Vart?Per donare alle persone un luogo in più in cui rifugiarsi dalla realtà e per esplorare me stesso.Molti altri ""motori"" si sono attivati nel corso degli anni, fra cui il voler creare una saga che contenesse una rappresentazione della comunità LGBT+ che andasse oltre quegli stereotipi che purtroppo ancora molto spesso portano nella letteratura young adult un'immagine distorta di tutte quelle persone al di fuori dell'eterosessualità e della cisessualità.Essendo io stesso parte della comunità come non-binary, desidero scrivere una storia che abbia al suo interno più varietà possibile di orientamenti sessuali e di genere, in modo da poter dare agli altri giovani della comunità la possibilità di immedesimarsi in una saga in cui i contenuti LGBT+ siano integrati alle tematiche principali della trama.

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>Mjølner is a Viking inspired restaurant and bar created in Thor’s image. Thor, the Viking God of thunder, has moved to earth to protect the world from evil. He misses the camaraderie of home and the feasts of Valhalla so he builds his own feasting hall inspired by the Asgardian feasts and names it Mjølner, after his famous hammer.</p>
<p>The Mjølner experience offers guests a sense of escapism with the enjoyment of fine food and world class drinks in Viking luxe surrounds. </p>
<p>Alongside the modern interpretation of a Viking feast, Norse iconography is carved into shields, drinking horns, axes and ornate handmade knives – presented to each guest in a leather knife roll (choose your weapon!). The dining rooms, moody and majestic are filled with museum grade artefacts, hand carved timber tables, animal hide wall hangings and seats, antique swords, leather booths and cast iron cages home to top shelf whiskies.</p>
<p>The inspiration behind Mjølner came from The Speakeasy Group’s owner and director, Norwegian born Sven Almenning. Growing up surrounded by Norse mythology, Sven and business partner Greg Sanderson set out to create an earthly nod to the feasting halls of Valhalla, transported in time to the 21st century.</p>
<h3>Why a recipe book?</h3>
<p>The intention of this recipe book is to immerse the magic of Mjølner's food, beverage and experience into your homes and allow you to create a Valhalla style feast of your own. It's the perfect gift for anyone who enjoys dining at Mjølner, or who have an interest and passion for Vikings and Norse Mythology</p>
<h3>Why crowdfund? </h3>
<p>In order to avoid traditional avenues of publication where our precious, albeit slightly crazy creative content and stories may be watered down, Mjølner will be raising funds in order to self-publish – and ensure Owner and Directors Sven Almenning and Greg Sanderson can sneak in their signature swearing in somewhere....</p>
<h3>What is actually going in the book? </h3>
<p>Recipes from the kitchens and bars – some of which have been as well guarded as the Bifrost Bridge since Mjølner’s respective openings in Sydney in 2017 and Melbourne in 2018, The Viking Feast will be jam packed with all the ingredients needed to recreate a Viking Feast at home.</p>
<p>Carefully curated by Mjølner Head Chefs; the talented Joachim Borenius (Sydney) and Andrew Wright (Melbourne), The Viking Feast will guide you through mains dishes of bird, beast, fish and veg as well as shared feasts including roasted bone marrow, gravlax and our signature Trenchers complemented by impressive sides and desserts.</p>
<p>In addition, our award winning bartenders Alissa Gabriel (Sydney) and Alex Boon (Melbourne) will be sharing the secrets behind Mjølner's most creative and tasty libations. </p>
<p>The book will also heavily feature Norse Mythology, symbology and story telling through original artworks and writing. </p>

<p>Self publishing is a costly business - especially with all the unbelievably talented artists, photographers, illustrators and story tellers we hope to get on board without the financial backing of a mainstream publishing house.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>Be the Outlier is a comprehensive guide on how to ace data science job interviews. In this book, I break down the types of questions you can expect in an interview depending on the job role you are applying for, whether it be Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Analyst, etc. Because there is a certain level of ambiguity around the “data science” and “analytics” job profile, I wrote this book to provide you with structure when you’re preparing for interviews.<br/><br/>As a Data Scientist, I know how nerve-wracking it can be to prepare for interviews, and it only gets worse when you aren’t sure what to expect. That’s exactly why I wrote this book, which covers all aspects of a data science interview in today’s industry and highlights how you can differentiate yourself from your peers and Be the Outlier.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how easily you can differentiate yourself from other candidates and land your dream job by applying some structure and rigor to the application process. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for data science. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you ace your data science interviews.<br/><br/>If you are an aspiring data scientist looking to break into the field, a data scientist looking for a job change, or someone who just wants to learn more about the data science field, then this book is for you.<br/> <h2>The Book - <i>Be the Outlier</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in 5 Parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the Introduction and Chapters 1-3. In this section, we discuss what exactly constitutes data science and what the market is currently looking for in data scientists. Drawing from interviews with experienced data science professionals working with companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, MBB, Big 4 consulting firms, and large industry-specific organizations, I will provide you with insight into the current market expectations. From there, we will dive into what you want to do and what your course of action should be when it comes to interview prep.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4-7. This section of the book focuses on the types of questions you can expect in the areas of Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, Programming, Statistics, and Case Interviews for Data Science. Each chapter highlights the structure to follow that will enable you to ace these interviews. We will also look at sample questions and answers, which have been curated based on real questions that candidates were asked within the last year.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 8-11. This section looks at the finer aspects of a data science interview. Chapter 8 will enable you to master the often-asked “Tell me about a project you worked on” interview question. From there, Chapter 9-11 will give you the tips and tricks you need to crack the take-home exam, presentation interview, and behavioral interview.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapters 12-13. Here, we will gain insight as to what should be covered in a data scientist’s resume and the best approach to follow when building one. We will also look at how can you differentiate yourself when building a data science portfolio by answering questions such as, “What is a data science portfolio?”, “Who should build one?”, and “What should you include?”<br/><br/>Part 5 contains Chapters 14. Every interview process is a journey, and in this chapter, we talk about where you should go from here. We will identify additional resources so that you have everything you need to get the job you want!</p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in July 2020</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this summer</li>
</ul> When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Purpose and Drive</h3>
<p>In 2011, three Massachusetts artists, from different artistic backgrounds, were united by one passion: poetry. We (Evin, Tatiana, and Mark) originally met during a theatre production and have since become very good friends. </p>
<p>We decided to create a multi media-dimensional project that would encompass as many of our artistic interests as possible: poetry, music, graphic design, and performing arts. The project, entitled Empty Room Poets, eventually took shape as a poetry book with an attached CD album.</p>

<p>This Indiegogo project will fund the production, publication and distribution of an eBook and paperback book autobiography and documentary DVD of Werner Münzer’s life story, but primarily concerns itself with the thirteen significant factors and events that helped him to survive 757 days captivity in ten Nazi concentration camps, without having compromised his humanity.</p>
<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>Werner Münzer was born in Berlin, Germany in 1920. Most of his family perished in the Holocaust, including his first wife, son and brother. In fact most of his extended family was robbed of all their belongings and murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators. Research into what became of his family indicates that over 400 people with his family name are officially listed as having been murdered by the Nazis. The fact that he managed to survive is nothing short of a miracle, or shall we say at least 13 of them. After living underground for two years, he was captured by the Gestapo in Amsterdam, Holland on March 20, 1943. His liberation came at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on April 15, 1945, where after several days of lying buried in a pile of dead bodies he managed to get an allied soldiers attention and be rescued. He spent over 18 months in hospitals recovering from severe malnutrition (weighing in at 77 lbs), and having Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever and numerous broken bones. At one point he was close to being declared dead.</p>
<p><strong>What Else is Significant about this Project?</strong></p>
<p>The Crowdfunding and self publishing format allow for a unique twist in writing an autobiography. They allow us to have certain sponsors ask the author questions and even follow-up questions based on their pre-publication reading of the book's manuscript. This form of interactive publishing provides readers the opportunity to engage the author to respond to matters that they find of particular interests. These questions will be the basis for a documentary interview DVD which will cover the questions and answers. The text of which will then also be included in the published book.</p>
<p>Since sponsors of Crowdfunding projects often pledge more than the value of the Perks being offered, and it is the Münzer family's wish that this story find the broadest possible distribution, all contributions in excess of the price of a book or DVD will be put towards the purchase of additional copies of the book and DVD. These will be donated to schools, libraries or other institutions interested in having the book available to their readers. This also applies to any pledge received that is below the price of a book or DVD. Thus, a dollar pledged will go towards the purchase of a book that will be donated. Large sponsors will have the opportunity to take delivery of the ""Perk"" books and themselves donate these to the institutions of their liking, thus enjoy whatever benefits such donations may entail.</p>
<p><strong>If you can’t pledge money and still would like to help</strong></p>
<p>Crowdfunding is all about getting the word out. Even if you can’t make a monetary contribution, and find this project worthy of your assistance, please help us to spread the word to as many people as possible. Every dollar goes towards a book being donated, so please help us get attention to our project by telling friends, family and any organization you think might be interested.</p>
<p><strong>How funds will be used</strong></p>
<p>Please be aware that this project is a “Flexible Funding Campaign” meaning we will receive whatever is pledged, no matter what. What this means, is that The Significant 13 will be published, no matter what. If our funding goal is not met, we will have to reduce or eliminate the professional help we require funding for. Budgeted elements such as for quality editing, formatting, artwork, promotion, quality camera equipment and other things that will make this publication a better quality book and DVD will be reduced or eliminated. The content however, will be the same. In the event we exceed our funding goal by more than 75%, a hardcopy book will be printed and distributed to those who pledge for a paperback book, at no extra charge to our sponsors. The Perk related books, which are intended to be donated, will still be printed and delivered in paperback form.</p>
<p><strong>Final note</strong></p>
<p>The Holocaust was not only the greatest genocide in human history, it was also the biggest heist; all assets and belongings of those murdered, displaced and of the survivors were stolen. Most were never returned! Most of the beneficiaries, who stole all these belongings, were ignored in the swift prosecution of the few of the worst murderers who were brought to justice.</p>
<p>We live in a time that holds great promise for the future of the human race. Our prospects to evolve in a positive manner have never been greater, yet the elements that allowed, ignored, contributed to and promoted the Holocaust still exist. This is why survivors always stress that their stories must be told, so that the Holocaust never occurs again. There are no guarantees in life, no matter where you live! And if we don’t examine our history we will not be able to timely recognize or prevent similar events.</p>
<p>This book is intended to raise awareness, and provide a spiritual strength that at our darkest hour, there is always still hope.</p></div>","The Significant 13

<p>Char Broiled  is the first installment of a hard-boiled trilogy that I began writing in early 2010, featuring Afghanistan war veteran and mixed martial artist Char Sadao.</p>
<p>My affinity to the hard-boiled genre stems from its capacity to deal realistically with society's ills.  Writing in the first person allows observations an omniscient narrator may have trouble communicating, and  I've  always gotten more emotional impact from fiction as opposed to non-fiction. Like a chef I have to do what I know and like, confident people will eat it up.</p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong></p>
<p>My first book, Endless Knot (Insomniac Press, 2001),  was an autobiographical look at my time living in a Zen temple while running fetish parties for a living. Overall it was a good experience, but meaning was lost in the editorial process for the simple reason that major publishers have their own agendas. </p>
<p>In 2009 my hard-boiled fiction won a grant  from the peer review board of the Canada Council for the Arts. Following that a blue-pencil meeting with a New York Times bestselling author, as well as meetings with several publishers, indicated to me Char Broiled is ready. Sensitive topics, such as society's acceptance of violence while it judges aspects of sexuality, critical timing and my past experiences with mainstream  publishing, have convinced me to keep control over the project.</p>
<p>Enter Indiegogo.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo funds will be used to pay for additional editorial and artistic design of Char Broiled,  for its sale on Amazon and other sites in 2011. Funds above the minimum requested will be put toward the trilogy, with the follow-ups to be released in 2012 and 2013.</p>

This combination road trip, documentary is about the last 6 weeks of freedom before trial of New Jersey marijuana activist Ed Forchion aka The New Jersey Weedman (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NJWEEDMAN). Forchion is set to go to trial on April 10th in Burlington County New Jersey on charges stemming from a April 1st 2010 traffic stop in Mt Holly, New Jersey.
 




 

There Are Few People That Fight For Marijuana As Hard As NJWeedman. If you don’t know about NJWeedman, and you consume marijuana, where have you been smoking your marijuana, under a rock?  

 
This New Jersey native known as NJWEEDMAN has lived in Los Angeles since 2008 is planning to drive his Weedmobil (http://www.vimeo.com/19910141) beginning March 20th across the country to New Jersey filming all the way. He expects to be harassed by law enforcement because of his ""free speech protected slogans"" on his vehicle. Yet he plans on Meeting up with marijuana activist, jury rights groups, civil libertarians and media personell nationwide. (http://www.home.njweedman.com/node/17) Using  social media sites and the Internet to spread the message of his trial and more importantly his defense. 


When I left in 2008 I said I'd be back, If this is a ""war"" my analogy is I feel like General McAuthur returning to defeat the Japanese enemy In my case its ""NJ Governor Christie"".


Forchion is convinced that the way to end the Gov't war on potheads is to challenge the Gov't in courtrooms, to utilize jury nullification defenses, to openly question the law to jurors. He calls his defense a open advocation of Jury Nullification. The legal community considers this anarchy, while many believe it's the right of a citizen to present such a defense to stop the tyranny of Government. Forchion is risking a good portion of his freedom to prove it.

National implications
Potheads, ganja smokers and many in the Cannabis Consuming Community of America are watching this trial. If Forchion can pull of this modern day David vs Golitah story not only will he solidify his position as a cult figure in the marijuana movement but in the history books of America. He and his case will enlighten many on how to end the current drug war on marijuana users.
Forchion says major social change happens thru courtrooms in this country pointing out ROE vs WADE,  and BROWN vs BOARD of EDUCATION to name a couple. Forchion knows more than half of the American public believe marijuana should be legal. With this fact he believes at least 6 of his jurors will think so as well, his goal at trial is to convince one of them to say ""NOT GUILTY"". He's openly looking for potheads to serve on his jury. He's gambling with his freedom that at least one of them endorses his Jury Nullification arguments and that's all he needs to convince ONE.

NJWEEDMAN believes that his case, his defense if given wide media coverage could open the eyes of the American people on a national level on how to end this failed drug war. 


Documentary Expenses 
While it can take as little as 3 days to go coast to coast NJWeedman plans to make it a 10 day trip stopping all across the country spreading his message of nullification. Once in New Jersey Forchion plans to gathering signatures for his entree into the congressional elections. Again filming this a must. Forchion plans on going to trial as a candidate for congress ( 3rd district) under The Legalize Marijuana Party. The end of the film will be the verdict of the jury.

A film crew has agreed to make this a professional project and will film it all at a very inexpense rate but not for free. The crew will be making a sizzle reel for a proposed show featuring NJWeedman if he prevails in his trial. Come on potheads if you ever wanted to support a pothead this is these.

1- the Weedmobil needs to have some minor repairs/ tuneup $500
2 - the Weedmobil needs to be outfitted with cameras est $2500
3 - chase vehicle for film crew needs tune up $300

<p><font><span>
<span>Over the years, I
have written personal experiences and observations that helped me get through.

taught me to be grateful.</span></span></font></p>
<font>
<p><span><span><font>It’s never been

My career started in print but moved to writing exclusively online when CNET News hired me to staff its Washington, DC, bureau in May 1999. I later worked as an analyst for Jupiter Research, then edited and managed the Apple Watch and Microsoft Watch blogs for Ziff Davis Enterprise. More recently, my title is <a href=""http://www.betanews.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BetaNews</a> executive editor.</p><p>I am an authoritative writer who, with this book, plans to fundamentally correct egregious problems debilitating the news industry. That should matter to every organization about which bloggers, journalists, or anyone else writes online.</p><p>Your problem is this: Blogs and news organizations participating in the Google-free economy run like hamsters in a wheel. The majority chase revenue they can never catch. There is too much online content, and too much of it is alike, to sustain advertising for all.  There is too much space for advertising and, as such, <a href=""http://adage.com/article/media/online-ad-rates-falling-sites-explore-ad-free-business/240620/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ad rates are free-falling</a>.</p><p>The consequence, as those hamsters fight for food: Reporting standards weaken in pursuit of pageviews and higher search ranking. Rampant rumormongering replaces factual reporting; so-called link-bating and news aggregation acerbate the practices. Tech coverage is glaring example of rumor too often masquerading as news.

Many bloggers don’t know any better, while too many professional journalists forego their training. Someone should show a better way, and one where everyone benefits.</p><p><em>Be a Better Blogger</em> identifies problems with online news writing; sets realistic principles for reporting and writing well; and proposes sensible practices for the new era of contextual journalism.</p><p>Because of the Internet and widespread adoption of mobile devices in the so-called post-PC era, change in the news industry is inevitable. But it shouldn't be <em>this</em>. Rather than seek pageviews, news organizations need to return focus on building readership and, with that, <em>trust</em>. Producing <a href=""http://www.joewilcox.com/2009/07/20/its-original-reporting-or-nothing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">original content</a> and adopting <a href=""http://www.joewilcox.com/2011/09/25/single-sourcing-is-the-source-of-news-evil/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">proper sourcing</a> standards are tantamount.</p><p>News organizations must adapt, too, to the post-PC era. <em>Be a Better Blogger</em> puts this adaptation into four categories of reporting: <a href=""http://www.joewilcox.com/tag/advocacy-journalism/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Advocacy Journalism</a>, Contextual Journalism, <a href=""http://www.joewilcox.com/tag/conversational-journalism/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Conversational Journalism</a>, and <a href=""http://www.joewilcox.com/2009/07/21/process-journalism-and-original-reporting/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Process Journalism</a>. Behind them all are principles for responsible reporting.</p><p>Every rumor and inaccurate news report risks damaging your organization's reputation, or if a public company, share price. <em>Be a Better Blogger</em> creates a baseline standard for all online news writers. Everyone benefits from responsible reporting.</p><p>But for you to receive this benefit, I need to complete the book and market it. <em>Be a Better Blogger</em> cannot succeed without your financial assistance. Hence, my crowdfunding campaign, which so far focused too much on potential readers and not enough on the wider audience of contributors.</p><p>Please make a contribution or corporate sponsorship.

</div></div>","Important Update: We have a matching funds offer. A contributor has offered $4,000 to meet the original goal, if the campaign can fund to $3,500.*************Are you tired of reading misleading blog posts or news stories? Do rampant rumors, written as news, cause problems for your business, government agency, non-profit, or other organization? Then you should contribute to Be a Better Blogger. While the forthcoming book's audience of buyers is writers of every kind, the group of potential contributors is likely larger. That's you. Businesses or individuals in the news have the most to lose when rumors run amok and the most to gain from stories that are responsibly reported and factually written. My book will help writers of every kind, not just bloggers, do their jobs better. Your contribution to my crowdfunding campaign is an investment that benefits you, whether someone who reads the news or is subject of it. Joe Wilcox is my name. I bring two decades of editing and reporting skills to what I call online contextual journalism. My career started in print but moved to writing exclusively online when CNET News hired me to staff its Washington, DC, bureau in May 1999. I later worked as an analyst for Jupiter Research, then edited and managed the Apple Watch and Microsoft Watch blogs for Ziff Davis Enterprise. More recently, my title is BetaNews executive editor.I am an authoritative writer who, with this book, plans to fundamentally correct egregious problems debilitating the news industry. That should matter to every organization about which bloggers, journalists, or anyone else writes online.Your problem is this: Blogs and news organizations participating in the Google-free economy run like hamsters in a wheel. The majority chase revenue they can never catch. There is too much online content, and too much of it is alike, to sustain advertising for all.  There is too much space for advertising and, as such, ad rates are free-falling.The consequence, as those hamsters fight for food: Reporting standards weaken in pursuit of pageviews and higher search ranking. Rampant rumormongering replaces factual reporting; so-called link-bating and news aggregation acerbate the practices. Tech coverage is glaring example of rumor too often masquerading as news. Stories about Apple is prime example. There is too much pressure on everyone to deliver more stories in less time. Post first, fix it later is too common practice. It’s a bloodbath; accuracy is the murder victim and readers are the wonted next of kin.My original pitch for this crowdfunding campaign.The Fourth Estate, as the news industry is often referred, has lost its way. Many bloggers don’t know any better, while too many professional journalists forego their training. Someone should show a better way, and one where everyone benefits.Be a Better Blogger identifies problems with online news writing; sets realistic principles for reporting and writing well; and proposes sensible practices for the new era of contextual journalism.Because of the Internet and widespread adoption of mobile devices in the so-called post-PC era, change in the news industry is inevitable. But it shouldn't be this. Rather than seek pageviews, news organizations need to return focus on building readership and, with that, trust. Producing original content and adopting proper sourcing standards are tantamount.News organizations must adapt, too, to the post-PC era. Be a Better Blogger puts this adaptation into four categories of reporting: Advocacy Journalism, Contextual Journalism, Conversational Journalism, and Process Journalism. Behind them all are principles for responsible reporting.Every rumor and inaccurate news report risks damaging your organization's reputation, or if a public company, share price. Be a Better Blogger creates a baseline standard for all online news writers. Everyone benefits from responsible reporting.But for you to receive this benefit, I need to complete the book and market it. Be a Better Blogger cannot succeed without your financial assistance. Hence, my crowdfunding campaign, which so far focused too much on potential readers and not enough on the wider audience of contributors.Please make a contribution or corporate sponsorship. If this book achieves the objectives promised, over the long-term the biggest beneficiary will be you.Please don't hesitate to contact me with questions or suggestions.

<p>When Nigerian novelist, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, addressed the TED Conference in 2009, she spoke of <em>the danger of the</em> <em>single story</em>, a distorted, one-dimensional view of Africa that sees the continent only through a prism of war, disease, poverty, starvation and corruption. Short Story Day Africa has established a day, 21st June – the shortest day of the year – on which to celebrate the diversity of Africa’s voices and tell you who we really are; what we love; love to eat, read, write about. We want to bring you the scents on our street corners, the gossip from our neighbours, let you listen to strains of the music we dance to.</p>
<p>Short Story Day Africa brings together writers, readers, booksellers, publishers, teachers and school children from all over the globe to write, submit, read, workshop and discuss stories - and foster the love of reading and writing African fiction. Because we have something to tell the world. About us. In our own voices.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Short Story Day Africa is in its third year and the project has grown substantially since we began. This year, due to the volume of writers who ask us again and again to publish them, we'll be bringing out two collections of short stories selected from our competitions. Everyone -  established writers and emerging ones, young and old - will have the opportunity to be read.   Please help us reach our funding goal and in return, we'll send you an e-book of our 2013 collection. Fund us in excess of $100 and you'll become an official sponsor of Short Story Day Africa 2013.</p>
<p>Why do we need the funding?  We're bringing out an anthology and we want it to be slick and polished, sans spelling errors and bad grammar. We need an editor and a proofreader. We're very lucky to have a talented editor standing by, ready to do both, but we'd like to pay her. <strong>Please help feed our editor!</strong> Editors, like writers, need cheese sandwiches. (If you don't know why we need cheese sandwiches, google ""Margaret Atwood, cheese sandwiches"").</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Literacy! By running competitions and workshops in schools and beyond, we foster a love of writing that leads to a love of reading. Perhaps we inspire the next Chimamanda. Perhaps, ten years from now, a best-selling author will be asked why they started writing and they'll say they entered a competition for Short Story Day Africa, got published and discovered a passion for the written word. You could be reading that writer. In fact, what's to stop you being that writer?</p>
<p>In 2011, we had four Grade 5 classes take part in our workshops. Last year, our reach expanded and we were flooded with beautiful stories written by kids as young as five writing about their favourite animals; tweens, pretending to be scarves and jewelry; and teenagers writing about dancing. Our adult competition saw imaginative entries ranging from sci-fi insects to horror stories about lice.  They're out there, these wonderful talented people who write and want access to stories. You're out there. We want to give you the opportunity to do both. It's a wonderful plan, don't you think?</p></div>","Who We Are

<h3>Brief History</h3>
<p>Back in the early 2011, we, an online community of photographers on social network <a href=""https://plus.google.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Google+</a> thought it might be a fun idea to get together and publish a photography book containing some of our favorite photographs taken in the year just ended. As the idea of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xULDmaEIeyg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Plus One Collection</a> book was born, it evolved into a project for a good cause, with all net proceeds from the sale of the book donated to charity. </p>
<p>As a result, we published a beautiful photography book in print and ebook formats containing photographs from 500+ photographers from 50+ countries around the world. Book shipped to 60+ countries. More importantly, we raised over $10,000 which were donated to Kiva. </p>
<h3>Plus One Collection 2012</h3>
<p>It felt great to publish this book last year, and we're doing the next volume this year. The rules are the same - anyone can contribute an image. We will then publish a print book, and an ebook which will contain all contributions.</p>
<p>To learn more about the book, and how you can contribute your photography, please <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xULDmaEIeyg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">visit our website</a>. </p>
<h3>Charitable Cause We're Supporting</h3>
<p>This year we're pretty excited to partner with <a href=""http://thekilgorisproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Kilgoris Project</a>, and through the sales of the book and with your help we aim to raise enough money to supply children from the Kenyan Maasai Community with digital cameras and the skills to document their lives, photographing their families, their schools, their friends and their daily activities. In liaison with schools, orphanages and community leaders, our aim is to encourage and assist the children to create a visual documentary of their environment.</p>
<p>The images created will be collated in a book or content for an exhibition. This will then be launched with purpose of hopefully raising sufficient funds to feed back to the community, providing vital equipment such as clean water systems, medical supplies, food and clothing.</p>
<p>We hope this to be just the first step with this incredible project, a project that will not only gives us all a better insight and understanding into these children's lives. But also empower them to document their own story and to keep their traditions and culture alive.</p>

<h3>""Two Men Enter, One Man Leaves.""</h3>
<p>It's the only rule of ThunderDome. You remember that movie, right? Are we that old? It's the guiding philosophy of ThunderDome Press. (But less gendered, and really, instead of people entering an arena, it's just you and the story.)</p>

We don't believe in genre, we just believe in story. We bring them to you, and you face them down. The writing challenges you, moves you, changes you. Or maybe not. But in the reading, you learn something about yourself and the world around you.</p>

We featured stories by Craig Clevenger, Richard Thomas, Nik Korpon and many other great authors. That was just the beginning.</p>
<p>In 2013, ThunderDome Press will release two more print collections, with more on the way. But we're a small press, and this is a big ocean. That's where YOU come in!</p>
<p>We're starting this crowdfunding campaign because while authors love to see their work out there in the world, they love it even more when they can get paid for their work. We want ThunderDome Press to continue to attract quality work from renowned writers, and we want to pay professional rates to those writers for their work. </p>

<h3>THE BOOKS!</h3>

It's the only rule of ThunderDome. You remember that movie, right? Are we that old? It's the guiding philosophy of ThunderDome Press. (But less gendered, and really, instead of people entering an arena, it's just you and the story.)
ThunderDomeMag.com started with the philosophy that reading is for everyone. Everyone has time for it, everyone should do it. We don't believe in genre, we just believe in story. We bring them to you, and you face them down. The writing challenges you, moves you, changes you. Or maybe not. But in the reading, you learn something about yourself and the world around you.
At the end of 2011, we expanded beyond our online confines and released our first print collection, ""...In Search of a City: Los Angeles in 1,000 Words"". We featured stories by Craig Clevenger, Richard Thomas, Nik Korpon and many other great authors. That was just the beginning.
In 2013, ThunderDome Press will release two more print collections, with more on the way. But we're a small press, and this is a big ocean. That's where YOU come in!
We're starting this crowdfunding campaign because while authors love to see their work out there in the world, they love it even more when they can get paid for their work. We want ThunderDome Press to continue to attract quality work from renowned writers, and we want to pay professional rates to those writers for their work. 


THE BOOKS!
Our 2013 print collections showcase our dedication to the eclectic. We've got something for every reader! The artwork presented here is NOT the final cover for either book. We're finalizing those now and will post them as time permits. Our goal, in print, is to ALWAYS be beautiful. 
CIPHER SISTERS (Late July 2013) Edited by Amanda Gowin & Michael Paul Gonzalez
Twin sisters, discovered dead in a house. No known relatives. No foul play. Who are they? Who were they? Inspired by the true story of the Miller Sisters, our story focuses on the lives of twin sisters Lucy and Darcy, piecing together their lives from true stories, legends, and pure conjecture. With these tales, we learn about them and their effect on the people who knew them, loved them, or maybe only met them once. Together, these stories present a life filled with love, dedication, anger, hatred, fighting, success, failure, and perseverance.  Featuring stories by Richard Thomas, DB Cox, edward j rathke, and Edward Morris. 
The print edition of this book will be presented as a full-bleed black & white collection featuring photos and artwork not seen in the electronic edition!

<p><b>What is “A Tale of Two Sisters”?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Heather Elisabeth, and I speak for
myself and for my sister Tori in explaining what our funding project on
Indiegogo is all about. It has taken a few months to put this all together and
after reading this you might understand the difficult but healing process it
has been. Although it is a dark subject, this book is for a very good cause,
and many good causes out there are being funded, so we hope you might find it
as such! Let me explain.</p>
<p>This is a story about two (out of four) sisters who,
unbeknownst to the other, suffered at the hands of the same man. It is two
perspectives of the wrath of that man, Tori’s husband at the time, and my
ex-brother-in-law. The story begins much earlier in our lives and tells of how
and why we lost our self-esteem along the way, rendering us vulnerable to a
predator.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Tori has already written her rough draft, and recently asked me to write about what I went through as an
adolescent, and beyond, in order to complete the picture. While I was making the decision to commit to writing it, a good friend
of mine, the only person in whom I confided at the time this was going on,
asked me why – why would Tori ask me to write about this? Well, there are
several reasons, and as I have begun the process, I would say it is because
deep down, we both knew it would be a cautionary tale for the millions of
children, women, and men who have suffered abuse in some way. Yes, I knew
it would be difficult, going into that dark part of my life, but worse for me
to keep it inside when I am a writer, and want to start somewhere with publishing
my stories. And starting here, with Tori, means that she and I can support one
another through the completion of this somewhat difficult task.  A much better plan indeed!</p>

<br/>
<p>Hi, my name is Tori Pratt, and this is the story of how I got into an
abusive marriage, what I went through there, and of my sister Heather's abuse at the
hands of my husband. Writing this story is one of the hardest things I've done
- going back to relive the painful details, and getting back into the head of
that frightened girl. By writing it, I am completing that chapter of my life,
and moving on in healing and growing stronger. Finishing and publishing this book is a huge
step in healing and empowerment. It will give us the feeling of accomplishment,
boost our damaged self-esteem and confidence, and let us know we are helping the
many other abuse victims out there make positive changes  in their lives,
and know that they are not alone and can find support. </p>

you are contributing to the healing of these two sisters and many others in the
same situation. Here's how the money will be used:</p>

<p>If we go over our goal, we will be able to do more research and go on to write our next book together! And perhaps I will get myself a really nice desk and chair.</p>

<p>One day we were arguing, or rather, he was telling me what a slob I was, how if there were a pile of dogshit on the middle of the floor I would just walk around it. Well of course I wouldn’t have, but at the time, listening to him, I thought that maybe it was true. Even dogshit. “Yeah,” I thought, “I would probably just walk around it.” That seemed to make sense. I must have been really far gone to consider it as possibly true. Still, I didn’t want him to be right.</p>
<p>  “You don’t know anything about keeping house! Those ladies next door, they at least know how to keep a house clean and orderly. Look at this mess!”  He kicked a chair that had some clothes and books dumped on it. Some of them were his.  They all flew to the ground. Next he hit the table where the remnants of an old art project of mine still sat out, after a week; a sketch book, a glass of dried roses, a plate with dried water colors on it, a jar of blue-black water and paint brushes. “Why can’t you just put things away when you’re done with them!” he yelled. “This place is a pig sty! And you just sit there! You’re just a walking, talking piece of <i>shit</i>!”</p>
<p>  I guess I felt like I needed to respond to that in some way, or else it would surely be true. “Well, you’re the only one who thinks so,” I made myself say with all the defiance I could muster up.</p>
<p>  He steeled his eyes tight and, looking straight at me, he hissed into my face, “I’m the only one who <i>really knows you</i>.” He picked up a teapot from the table, hurled it to the floor, and stomped out of the apartment.</p>
<p>  I looked down in disbelief. The teapot crashed and broke and water splattered all over the floor. I stood still, unable to move. That last statement cut me deep in my soul, shredded some last remnants of who I thought I was. He was right--  he did know me best, I thought. I may actually be as worthless as he said, as worthless as I felt in my darkest moments.</p>
<p>I didn’t have any equipment to deal with this. I felt like a grenade had just been lobbed at me and exploded right about gut level. There I was, blown into small pieces and splattered on the floor with the broken kettle and spilled water.  I slowly turned away from the mess, and fell down on the bed sobbing. I didn’t know what those emotions were that thrashed my being, but I knew they hurt. I started to think that what he said was really true. I guess I was a piece of shit — he had proof! He knew me really well! I couldn’t argue with that. But did everyone else think so? I needed to know. I couldn’t calm myself down until I talked to someone about it.</p>
<p>We didn’t have a phone in the apartment, but there was a pay phone at the other end of the building, on the street. I desperately wanted to talk to someone, but I couldn’t control the convulsive crying; it took over my body. I was afraid to go out to the street, afraid maybe I wouldn’t make it to the phone, or worse, someone I called would say, “Well, yeah, I didn’t want to say it, but you’re pretty much a piece of shit. He’s right.” The heaves kept coming, bigger and louder waves crashing over me.</p>

<div><p>Tori and I grew up together in three different
countries, in an extremely dysfunctional family. Our parents were never on the
same page, and argued very passively for years. The combination of all this had
us girls rather mixed up, culturally and emotionally. We were all unhappy at
different points in our lives, and experienced rather a lot of trauma while we
were growing up, and even well into our adulthood. Three of us wrote about it
intermittently through the years as a means of expression and release. As a
musician, I also wrote songs for the same reason.  We all found our creative outlets, and unfortunately our not so creative vices, and I wrote about that in song and prose as well. Thank God for my journals...and even the vices I depended on, in moderation, of course. They saved me from slipping through the cracks of my bitterly lonely home life. Let me rewind a bit.</p></div>The first time our family moved to Japan was in the fifties, after the war and when Dad was working as a diplomat in the American Embassy in downtown Tokyo. He was also chief interpreter of the war crime trials being held in Manila, and was driven to moving up in rank as a marine. For that reason, he was not as present as many dads can be in the dynamic of the family. You could tell he always had more important things on his mind. As his daughters, we thought that no matter what was really going on in his head, that perhaps we had done something wrong, that we were to blame for his aloof, uninterested, and quite often stern approach to interacting with us, or not interacting at all. </div><div> Mom had her own way of coping with his lack of interest in her or the family, and got involved with the Christian Science church community in Tokyo, while falling in love with the posh life of living high on the horse in a beautiful, safe city. She was rather a home body and liked her privacy, and in Japan, no one pestered her to come and socialize. She could attend church and maybe an after church event, take the kids to brunch at the Sanno Hotel, the downtown military hotel where we ate and swam at the pool after church, shopped at the PX, and watched matinees. She'd then spend the rest of the week in her quiet home in Azabu, a part of Tokyo that was as lovely as a country neighborhood, right there in the middle of the city. The streets were lined with trees, there were parks with blossoms that brought beautiful bright colors to the neighborhoods in spring and summer. Behind the huge skyscrapers and grand hotels, there were tiny little streets with little stores that had bread and candy, fresh fruits and vegetables, and little markets with friendly merchants who shouted out their welcoming invitations to buy their fresh meat and fish. Vendors  sang of hot sweet potatoes and delicious noodles  while toting their carts around the little streets, bringing sweet and tangy smells to our noses on cold winter days. There were of course, in other parts of the city, huge department stores much like the ones in Chicago that Mom<span style=""background-color: initial;""> loved as a child. In later years it would become my city, my beloved Tokyo, where there was this feeling of well-being that held me together, as my family life began to fall apart.</span>

It is so deeply embedded in my troubled soul that I suppose in writing about it, those answers may surface. For now all I can do is tell you about it, dear reader, let the story unfold on its own.

<p>Child sexual abuse (CSA)
has lifelong effects.  Adults who are survivors of CSA often report a
feeling of being “stuck”.  Their efforts to build and manage their lives
often seem fruitless, hollow, or even hopeless.  There can be a persistent
perception that they are somehow different from others. They commonly
report feeling that they are on the outside looking in or believe that they
just don’t belong. The
adult symptoms of childhood abuse can take many forms.  Many adult
survivors may:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find
     it difficult to develop or maintain close personal relationships.</li>
<li>Have
     a strong desire to live in isolation or to “hide out” from life.</li>
<li>Endure
     physical ailments like neck, back, stomach and gynecological problems that
     persist despite efforts at good self-care.</li>
<li>Experience
     feelings of sadness, fear and anger that often seem unmanageable or
     overwhelming.</li>
<li>Undergo
     panics, rages, depressions, sleep disorders, or self-mutilation or have
     suicidal thoughts.</li>
<li>Find
     themselves depending on alcohol, other drugs, or may develop eating
     disorders to cover feelings of humiliation, shame and low self-esteem.</li>
<li>Experience
     problems like low self-esteem, avoidance of sex, promiscuity, or inability
     to experience sexual pleasure.</li>
<li>Exhibit
     signs of trauma like panic attacks, numbing of body areas, and feeling of
     being disconnected from their bodies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, a person can read these symptoms and get some
kind of statistical knowledge of what this is about, and even identify with it
to a point. But until you get into how these things come about, how they are
interwoven into our daily lives over the years, it really doesn’t compute. Not
in any way that is clear. What I feel, and what I read here in these
statistics, are indeed connected, but the only way I can communicate it to you
in a way that brings clarity to myself and my readers (hopefully!) is to relate
it to you in a creatively flowing way, in my story. Because this
is something so deep within our souls that it rarely sees the light of day. But
boy, does it ever need to be cleared from the cobwebs, and brought back into the light. This is my, and Tori's wish for this book.</p>

</div></div>","What is “A Tale of Two Sisters”?

Hi, my name is Heather Elisabeth, and I speak for
myself and for my sister Tori in explaining what our funding project on
Indiegogo is all about. It has taken a few months to put this all together and
after reading this you might understand the difficult but healing process it
has been. Although it is a dark subject, this book is for a very good cause,
and many good causes out there are being funded, so we hope you might find it
as such! Let me explain.
This is a story about two (out of four) sisters who,
unbeknownst to the other, suffered at the hands of the same man. It is two
perspectives of the wrath of that man, Tori’s husband at the time, and my
ex-brother-in-law. The story begins much earlier in our lives and tells of how
and why we lost our self-esteem along the way, rendering us vulnerable to a
predator.





Tori has already written her rough draft, and recently asked me to write about what I went through as an
adolescent, and beyond, in order to complete the picture. While I was making the decision to commit to writing it, a good friend
of mine, the only person in whom I confided at the time this was going on,
asked me why – why would Tori ask me to write about this? Well, there are
several reasons, and as I have begun the process, I would say it is because
deep down, we both knew it would be a cautionary tale for the millions of
children, women, and men who have suffered abuse in some way. Yes, I knew
it would be difficult, going into that dark part of my life, but worse for me
to keep it inside when I am a writer, and want to start somewhere with publishing
my stories. And starting here, with Tori, means that she and I can support one
another through the completion of this somewhat difficult task.  A much better plan indeed!



Hi, my name is Tori Pratt, and this is the story of how I got into an
abusive marriage, what I went through there, and of my sister Heather's abuse at the
hands of my husband. Writing this story is one of the hardest things I've done
- going back to relive the painful details, and getting back into the head of
that frightened girl. By writing it, I am completing that chapter of my life,
and moving on in healing and growing stronger. Finishing and publishing this book is a huge
step in healing and empowerment. It will give us the feeling of accomplishment,
boost our damaged self-esteem and confidence, and let us know we are helping the
many other abuse victims out there make positive changes  in their lives,
and know that they are not alone and can find support. 



The Money Bit!
By contributing to this
project, you are allowing Heather to focus on the writing and get the book
finished, published, and distributed. And know that by supporting this project,
you are contributing to the healing of these two sisters and many others in the
same situation. Here's how the money will be used:

·  Living
expenses while writing
·  A
computer (I currently borrow my daughter’s laptop every day. She is very      patient about
it, but...yeah)
·  Researching
for the book
·  Publishing
the book
·  Paying
the people who lovingly helped to create the project
Please note that I would be out in the working world to help pay for my living expenses, and hope to again, but I suffer from health issues which make it almost impossible to be in public where the ever-increasing issue of scents and harsh chemicals have landed me in the hospital more than once. Writing is something I can do easily in my safe home environment.
If we go over our goal, we will be able to do more research and go on to write our next book together! And perhaps I will get myself a really nice desk and chair.

Here are a couple of excerpts from A Tale of Two Sisters : 
*note - the following excerpts contain some alarming and somewhat graphic content.
Tori:



One day we were arguing, or rather, he was telling me what a slob I was, how if there were a pile of dogshit on the middle of the floor I would just walk around it. Well of course I wouldn’t have, but at the time, listening to him, I thought that maybe it was true. Even dogshit. “Yeah,” I thought, “I would probably just walk around it.” That seemed to make sense. I must have been really far gone to consider it as possibly true. Still, I didn’t want him to be right.
  “You don’t know anything about keeping house! Those ladies next door, they at least know how to keep a house clean and orderly. Look at this mess!”  He kicked a chair that had some clothes and books dumped on it. Some of them were his.  They all flew to the ground. Next he hit the table where the remnants of an old art project of mine still sat out, after a week; a sketch book, a glass of dried roses, a plate with dried water colors on it, a jar of blue-black water and paint brushes. “Why can’t you just put things away when you’re done with them!” he yelled. “This place is a pig sty! And you just sit there! You’re just a walking, talking piece of shit!”
  I guess I felt like I needed to respond to that in some way, or else it would surely be true. “Well, you’re the only one who thinks so,” I made myself say with all the defiance I could muster up.
  He steeled his eyes tight and, looking straight at me, he hissed into my face, “I’m the only one who really knows you.” He picked up a teapot from the table, hurled it to the floor, and stomped out of the apartment.
  I looked down in disbelief. The teapot crashed and broke and water splattered all over the floor. I stood still, unable to move. That last statement cut me deep in my soul, shredded some last remnants of who I thought I was. He was right--  he did know me best, I thought. I may actually be as worthless as he said, as worthless as I felt in my darkest moments.
I didn’t have any equipment to deal with this. I felt like a grenade had just been lobbed at me and exploded right about gut level. There I was, blown into small pieces and splattered on the floor with the broken kettle and spilled water.  I slowly turned away from the mess, and fell down on the bed sobbing. I didn’t know what those emotions were that thrashed my being, but I knew they hurt. I started to think that what he said was really true. I guess I was a piece of shit — he had proof! He knew me really well! I couldn’t argue with that. But did everyone else think so? I needed to know. I couldn’t calm myself down until I talked to someone about it.
We didn’t have a phone in the apartment, but there was a pay phone at the other end of the building, on the street. I desperately wanted to talk to someone, but I couldn’t control the convulsive crying; it took over my body. I was afraid to go out to the street, afraid maybe I wouldn’t make it to the phone, or worse, someone I called would say, “Well, yeah, I didn’t want to say it, but you’re pretty much a piece of shit. He’s right.” The heaves kept coming, bigger and louder waves crashing over me.
Heather:


Tori and I grew up together in three different
countries, in an extremely dysfunctional family. Our parents were never on the
same page, and argued very passively for years. The combination of all this had
us girls rather mixed up, culturally and emotionally. We were all unhappy at
different points in our lives, and experienced rather a lot of trauma while we
were growing up, and even well into our adulthood. Three of us wrote about it
intermittently through the years as a means of expression and release. As a
musician, I also wrote songs for the same reason.  We all found our creative outlets, and unfortunately our not so creative vices, and I wrote about that in song and prose as well. Thank God for my journals...and even the vices I depended on, in moderation, of course. They saved me from slipping through the cracks of my bitterly lonely home life. Let me rewind a bit.The first time our family moved to Japan was in the fifties, after the war and when Dad was working as a diplomat in the American Embassy in downtown Tokyo. He was also chief interpreter of the war crime trials being held in Manila, and was driven to moving up in rank as a marine. For that reason, he was not as present as many dads can be in the dynamic of the family. You could tell he always had more important things on his mind. As his daughters, we thought that no matter what was really going on in his head, that perhaps we had done something wrong, that we were to blame for his aloof, uninterested, and quite often stern approach to interacting with us, or not interacting at all.  Mom had her own way of coping with his lack of interest in her or the family, and got involved with the Christian Science church community in Tokyo, while falling in love with the posh life of living high on the horse in a beautiful, safe city. She was rather a home body and liked her privacy, and in Japan, no one pestered her to come and socialize. She could attend church and maybe an after church event, take the kids to brunch at the Sanno Hotel, the downtown military hotel where we ate and swam at the pool after church, shopped at the PX, and watched matinees. She'd then spend the rest of the week in her quiet home in Azabu, a part of Tokyo that was as lovely as a country neighborhood, right there in the middle of the city. The streets were lined with trees, there were parks with blossoms that brought beautiful bright colors to the neighborhoods in spring and summer. Behind the huge skyscrapers and grand hotels, there were tiny little streets with little stores that had bread and candy, fresh fruits and vegetables, and little markets with friendly merchants who shouted out their welcoming invitations to buy their fresh meat and fish. Vendors  sang of hot sweet potatoes and delicious noodles  while toting their carts around the little streets, bringing sweet and tangy smells to our noses on cold winter days. There were of course, in other parts of the city, huge department stores much like the ones in Chicago that Mom loved as a child. In later years it would become my city, my beloved Tokyo, where there was this feeling of well-being that held me together, as my family life began to fall apart.
                                                                      * * *I ask myself - how could I have let that man have his way with me? Why did he think it was perfectly ok to ask me if he could touch my breast when I was barely thirteen? Why did I not say, no!! You can't!! I can't find the answer. It is so deeply embedded in my troubled soul that I suppose in writing about it, those answers may surface. For now all I can do is tell you about it, dear reader, let the story unfold on its own. Perhaps you will know the answer before I even do.

Tori : Here are some statistics I found that are alarming,
but true, and why we know there are so many who need help :

At first glance Angelica is gorgeous, lives in a mansion with her two aunts, goes to a prestigious private school and has everything a teenager could want. That is until a few days before her 16th birthday she begins to have weird dreams,hallucinations, and paranoia of being watched. 
Suddenly one of her aunts is attacked.  Angelica is surprised when she learns  the attack occurred because her aunt was protecting Angelica from her father, Lucifer.  He has plans for Angelica whether she likes them or not.
Angelica is suddenly thrust into a dangerous, magical world. She finds out that no one is as they seem, magic is real and evil is lurking around every corner. She has to make a decision to run, fight or wait for the darkness to consume her.












Who Are You




My name is Tamekia Hayden and I am a single mother of four kids as well as an aspiring author. Somehow between working a full time job, attending school full time and tending to four kids between the ages of 7-15, I have managed to write a  young adult fantasy book called Waiting For The Beast. I have written a number of short stories in the past, but have never had the guts to publish or submit any of them until now.

What Are You Doing With My Contribution




I want to publish a beautiful book inside and out. I read somewhere ""If you invest nothing in your book, don’t expect readers to be very impressed, or compelled to buy it"" and ""even if you create a beautiful product, wonderfully written with professional presentation, if no one hears about it, your book will sit untouched online, gathering virtual dust."" With that being said here is what I need:




Editing $900
Cover Design $200
Book Formatting & Layout $250
Ebook Conversion $150

  Every contribution touches my soul because that means you believe in my dream. I know words aren't enough to express my gratitude for your contribution so I definitely have some perks for you. The more you contribute, the bigger the perk. If you decide that you don't want a perk and you contribute a different amount that's fine, but you still will receive a thank you from me either by email or a shout out on my Facebook page. There is no getting away from my gratitude!
If I don't reach my goal I will take what I have and put it towards the publishing of my book. Either way I will keep you updated every step of the way and on every aspect of what I am doing with your contributions. And I will make sure that you still get whatever perk was promised  to you.
How Will My Contribution Make A Difference





There are so many women who are talented, but because they have other things going on in their life such as  being a single parent, struggling financially, consumed with work, or a stay at home mom they forget about what makes them happy. They let their talents go to waste. If I can publish my book  this will inspire my daughters, my sisters, my girlfriends, and other women all over the world that no matter what is going on in your life,never lose sight of your dreams. Go after them! I can't promise you that you will like my book. You might even hate it lol. What I can promise you is that if you contribute I will see this through to the end and get it published. Failing is not an option and it definitely won't be one with your help.


But I Can't Contribute


That's okay! There are plenty of other ways you can help me.

Nothing new, there. A calendar alert pops up reminding her about the “End of the World Party” on 12-21.

Probably just a reminder that she must pay by the 30th to avoid another $100.00 late fee. </p><p>'Fat chance. My house is worth half what it was a year ago, but my mortgage payment just doubled. How do you explain that? They don’t pay me enough here to keep up with the rising interest rates. Good luck finding another job, though.'</p><p>Her lips twist in a sarcastic sneer. </p><p>'I better go start kissing Mr. Diehl’s fat ass.' </p><p>Swallowing the last of the sandwich, she stands and heads for his office, files tucked under her arm.</p><p>She knocks lightly on Mr. Diehl’s door, just underneath the engraved sign reading WARREN DIEHL, PRESIDENT.</p><p>“Come in.” </p><p>She sucks in a breath as she opens the door, filling her lungs with one last breath of clean air before immersing herself in the swirl of stale cigar smoke that is Mr. Diehl’s lair.</p><p>He is leaning back in his overloaded executive chair, the armrests almost obscured by the spread of his belly hanging over them. He gestures for her to take a seat in the threadbare wooden frame chair in front of his desk, and she tries not to let the disgust show on her face as he gurgles loudly and spits into a yellowed handkerchief, clearing his throat for the thousandth time today.</p><p>“Merridy, you have been with Such a Diehl Printing for eight years now, and you have proven yourself to be an effective manager; your projects are usually completed on time, and the other employees seem to like you.” He tilts his head down to peer over the bifocals perched on the fleshy hills of his cheeks. “Perhaps a bit too much.”</p><p>Does he know about Jack and me? I knew I shouldn’t have let him walk me to my car last week.</p><p>When she doesn’t respond to his goading, he continues. “Your sales record, however, leaves much to be desired. Once you get a hold of an account, it seems the volume starts to head downhill. Even regular customers, like Main Street, have been reducing their orders in the past six months. We’re supposed to up sell, not downsize.” Each sentence is punctuated by a slurping intake of air, making him sound like he is drowning in his own phlegm. </p><p>She opens the file and lets out the reserved breath, suppressing a cough and preparing to explain when Mr. Diehl raises his hand, like five plump sausages attached to a pork chop, to cut her off.</p><p>“Now, I understand that times are hard for everyone right now, and I wouldn’t want to send you packing without giving you a chance to redeem yourself. You take those sales leads I gave you last week and make some calls, and I’m sure you will be able to turn this thing around. You can wear that headset we got you so you don’t get a cramp in your neck. And it wouldn’t hurt to get an earlier start every day.” </p><p>The hand plops back down on the desk, and Merridy understands that she has been dismissed. She rises, tucks the file back under her arm, and exits the office without a backward glance. Phoebe peers through her bangs with a pitying gaze, but quickly looks down and starts shuffling papers upon catching the laser beams from Merridy’s eyes.</p><p>The rest of the day is spent in strained silence, except for her furious typing of e-mails and printing of contact lists. Nothing can make her wear that headset, or anything else that wraps around her head, reminding her of duct tape and cigarettes…But she will call every single one of those customers tomorrow, and damned if that pompous old snotbag is going to blame the collapse of the economy on her. </p><p>Sure, her sales accounts have been slipping; all of their regular customers have cut back on their advertising budgets, and some have even gone out of business. Nobody else spends any time dealing with customers’ accounts, and the old man hasn’t even answered the phone himself since Phoebe came along three years ago. If anyone deserves to be “sent packing”, it’s her, with her squeaky voice and her perky little “Howdy, Phoebe here!” What does she think this is, Cowboy Printing?</p><p>He does have a point about being on time, though. She sees the smirks on the crew’s faces, and it makes it hard to get a good start every day, even if she is only ten minutes late. It’s just so hard to get up in the morning when you’ve been waiting tables at Denny’s until 2:00 AM.</p><p>As soon as the clock flips to 5:00, she closes the work files and starts to shut down the computer. The last window open behind everything else is her Facebook page, with a new message from her mother on her wall.</p><p>Merridy’s Mom - Will you go with me tomorrow to see Dr. Bleier? I’m sure he can squeeze you in to get that mammogram you’ve been putting off…get it, SQUEEZE you in? LOL ;)</p><p>She rolls her eyes and blows her bangs up off her forehead. “Oh, mom. Just because you put a funny little note on my wall doesn’t mean it’s not still nagging. And don’t you think you’re a bit old for the text tags and emoticons? Besides, I can’t drive you to the city tomorrow, I’ve got a big day of groveling and begging ahead of me.”</p><p>Her fingers slip under the sleeve of her Such A Diehl T-shirt to slide gently over the smooth, raised circles of scars clustered there.</p><p>“She’s just trying to help, you know.”</p><p>Phoebe jumps back as Merridy sends her chair rolling off the carpet mat and spins around, ready to tell her off for reading over her shoulder, for butting in, for being so damn cute all the time. But the look on her face stops Merridy cold. She is biting her lip, clutching her hands to her chest, and her big, blue eyes look genuinely terrified. She looks like she is actually about to cry.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Phoebe. Did my chair roll over your toe? It’s just been a really rough day, and I’ve got to change and get to Denny’s by 6:00 if I want to get any dinner. Are you OK?”</p><p>Phoebe takes a quick breath and wipes her eyes, then runs both hands back through her blonde curls. It must be hard to be taken seriously when you look like a miniature version of Marilyn Monroe. She can’t be more than five feet tall, even with the spiked heels. The low-cut blouses and perfect makeup usually complete the picture of the self-assured Southern Belle, but right now she looks more like a china doll that is about to shatter into a million pieces.</p><p>“Have y’all been payin' attention to the news today? I’m really scared. Somethin’ is goin’ on ovah in Pakistan, and I don’t think it’s just goin' to blow ovah this time. They’re mobilizin' the troops in Afghanistan and massin' along the bordah, and you know my Bo is ovah theyah. I just don’t know what I would do if somethin’ happened to him. I wish his tour hadn’t been extended again…”</p><p>It takes at least fifteen minutes to listen sympathetically to Phoebe’s worries, calm her down and reassure her that the world is not about to end, finish shutting down her computer and dash into the bathroom to change into her waitress uniform. She is trotting across the street, digging the keys out of her purse to push the unlock button when she realizes she left her uneaten lunch under the desk. 'Shit.' Well, hopefully the rats won’t find it before tomorrow. 'What the hell is that?'</p><p>The paper tucked under her windshield wiper is a plain white, number 10 business sized envelope, and as she pulls it out she sees the Such A Diehl return address printed in the corner. She opens the door and plops into the driver’s seat, slipping her fingers under the unsealed flap with a worried look on her face. The note inside is handwritten on yellow lined tablet paper, folded rather unevenly.</p><p>Merridy,</p><p>I’m sorry to have to tell you this way, but I think we have to stop seeing each other (except at work, of course.) I know the Big Diehl doesn’t like employees “fraternizing”, but it’s more than that. You’re older than I am, you have your own house and everything, and I just don’t think I’m really what you’re looking for. You need a man who can be a husband and start a family, and I’m not even ready for that.</p><p>I hope you can understand. If you want to talk about it, I’ll be around this weekend. </p><p>Jack</p><p>Merridy lets the papers fall, crosses her arms on the steering wheel and bangs her forehead into them several times, punctuating each blow with a “Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!” </p><p>It’s been a long time since she really let loose with a good cry, and this seems as good a time as any. Everything is falling apart, and she can’t do anything to stop it. The moan rises from deep in her chest, pouring out along with the tears, filling the car with her sobs of frustration. It feels good to let it all out, instead of listening to that sarcastic voice in her head and trying to deny how crappy it all makes her feel. </p><p>She listens to herself bawling like a ten-year-old, and thinks maybe she should take the day off tomorrow and go to the city with her mom. After all, the world is going to end, so what does she have to lose? She snatches a Kleenex from the box on the floor, wipes her eyes and blows her nose, but she’s not quite done yet. Listening to herself taking one more shuddering breath, sitting there in a Denny’s uniform, the ridiculousness of her situation hits her, and she looks around to make sure nobody is walking anywhere nearby.</p><p>Twisting to look back over her right shoulder, she is embarrassed to see that her despair did indeed have an audience. Sitting on the tiny porch of a duplex apartment is an old woman wearing a bathrobe, fuzzy slippers, and a knitted ski cap with four points tipped with tassels.</p><p>Her face is so wrinkled that it looks like crumpled parchment, bunched up around a gap-toothed grin. She is nodding and raising one claw-like hand toward Merridy, gesturing to come closer. Though she appears to be nearly one hundred years old and probably suffering from dementia, her eyes are clear and bright, a gleaming sapphire blue that communicate an unmistakable intelligence. </p><p>Staring into those eyes, Merridy realizes that everything she is wearing is blue, though in wildly mismatched shades. She is certainly interested in Merridy, leaning forward to grab her walker and struggling to rise from the blue plastic chair crammed into a corner of the porch.</p><p>Merridy is frozen in fascination, watching the old woman over her shoulder as she pulls herself upright and shuffles toward the porch steps, never breaking eye contact. It is only when the front of the walker scoots off the edge of the porch that Merridy spins around, throws open her door and bolts around the back of her car to keep the old woman from tumbling down the stairs.</p><p>She hesitates by the bumper, one foot on the curb, when the old woman chuckles knowingly and points one gnarled finger at Merridy, as she stands poised precariously with one hand on her walker, still teetering with one leg hovering in the air.</p><p>Now the wizened face loses all traces of merriment, the wrinkles rearrange themselves into a serious combination of furrowed brows and pursed lips, and the hand raises up to point over Merridy’s head to the ridge of mountains behind her, in the direction of her home.</p><p>Still holding her gaze with those crystal blue eyes, the old woman croaks one word in a voice as dry and ancient as a mummy.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The spell is finally broken when the hand drops back down to maneuver the walker back around onto the porch and the old woman shuffles off through the door of her duplex, slamming it behind her.</p><p>Merridy shakes her head and stares down into the gutter, wondering what the hell that was all about.</p><p>“I do have to go, but I won’t be heading home for quite a while, yet. In fact, if I don’t get a move on, I’m gonna be late for the second time today.”</p><p>She plops into the driver’s seat, searching for her keys on the cushion beside her. She finds them under Jack’s note, and snatches it up in her left hand as she jams the keys into the ignition and starts the car with a satisfying roar.</p><p>A harsh laugh escapes her now, and she rips the note into several pieces and shoves it into the trash bag hanging off of the gearshift. </p><p>“You’re right, you are too young for me, Jack. I should have been the one to cut you loose.” She pulls down the sun visor and checks out her face in the mirror. At least her eyes aren’t too red. Not that it matters. Nobody at Denny’s cares what’s going on with her, anyway.</p><p></p></div>","Why would you want to go NowHere?Because it is the opposite of nowhere.

Nothing can make her wear that headset, or anything else that wraps around her head, reminding her of duct tape and cigarettes…But she will call every single one of those customers tomorrow, and damned if that pompous old snotbag is going to blame the collapse of the economy on her. Sure, her sales accounts have been slipping; all of their regular customers have cut back on their advertising budgets, and some have even gone out of business. Nobody else spends any time dealing with customers’ accounts, and the old man hasn’t even answered the phone himself since Phoebe came along three years ago. If anyone deserves to be “sent packing”, it’s her, with her squeaky voice and her perky little “Howdy, Phoebe here!” What does she think this is, Cowboy Printing?He does have a point about being on time, though. She sees the smirks on the crew’s faces, and it makes it hard to get a good start every day, even if she is only ten minutes late. It’s just so hard to get up in the morning when you’ve been waiting tables at Denny’s until 2:00 AM.As soon as the clock flips to 5:00, she closes the work files and starts to shut down the computer. The last window open behind everything else is her Facebook page, with a new message from her mother on her wall.Merridy’s Mom - Will you go with me tomorrow to see Dr. Bleier? I’m sure he can squeeze you in to get that mammogram you’ve been putting off…get it, SQUEEZE you in? LOL ;)She rolls her eyes and blows her bangs up off her forehead. “Oh, mom. Just because you put a funny little note on my wall doesn’t mean it’s not still nagging. And don’t you think you’re a bit old for the text tags and emoticons? Besides, I can’t drive you to the city tomorrow, I’ve got a big day of groveling and begging ahead of me.”Her fingers slip under the sleeve of her Such A Diehl T-shirt to slide gently over the smooth, raised circles of scars clustered there.“She’s just trying to help, you know.”Phoebe jumps back as Merridy sends her chair rolling off the carpet mat and spins around, ready to tell her off for reading over her shoulder, for butting in, for being so damn cute all the time. But the look on her face stops Merridy cold. She is biting her lip, clutching her hands to her chest, and her big, blue eyes look genuinely terrified. She looks like she is actually about to cry.“I’m sorry, Phoebe. Did my chair roll over your toe? It’s just been a really rough day, and I’ve got to change and get to Denny’s by 6:00 if I want to get any dinner. Are you OK?”Phoebe takes a quick breath and wipes her eyes, then runs both hands back through her blonde curls. It must be hard to be taken seriously when you look like a miniature version of Marilyn Monroe. She can’t be more than five feet tall, even with the spiked heels. The low-cut blouses and perfect makeup usually complete the picture of the self-assured Southern Belle, but right now she looks more like a china doll that is about to shatter into a million pieces.“Have y’all been payin' attention to the news today? I’m really scared. Somethin’ is goin’ on ovah in Pakistan, and I don’t think it’s just goin' to blow ovah this time. They’re mobilizin' the troops in Afghanistan and massin' along the bordah, and you know my Bo is ovah theyah. I just don’t know what I would do if somethin’ happened to him. I wish his tour hadn’t been extended again…”It takes at least fifteen minutes to listen sympathetically to Phoebe’s worries, calm her down and reassure her that the world is not about to end, finish shutting down her computer and dash into the bathroom to change into her waitress uniform. She is trotting across the street, digging the keys out of her purse to push the unlock button when she realizes she left her uneaten lunch under the desk. 'Shit.' Well, hopefully the rats won’t find it before tomorrow. 'What the hell is that?'The paper tucked under her windshield wiper is a plain white, number 10 business sized envelope, and as she pulls it out she sees the Such A Diehl return address printed in the corner. She opens the door and plops into the driver’s seat, slipping her fingers under the unsealed flap with a worried look on her face. The note inside is handwritten on yellow lined tablet paper, folded rather unevenly.Merridy,I’m sorry to have to tell you this way, but I think we have to stop seeing each other (except at work, of course.) I know the Big Diehl doesn’t like employees “fraternizing”, but it’s more than that. You’re older than I am, you have your own house and everything, and I just don’t think I’m really what you’re looking for. You need a man who can be a husband and start a family, and I’m not even ready for that.I hope you can understand. If you want to talk about it, I’ll be around this weekend. JackMerridy lets the papers fall, crosses her arms on the steering wheel and bangs her forehead into them several times, punctuating each blow with a “Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!” It’s been a long time since she really let loose with a good cry, and this seems as good a time as any. Everything is falling apart, and she can’t do anything to stop it. The moan rises from deep in her chest, pouring out along with the tears, filling the car with her sobs of frustration. It feels good to let it all out, instead of listening to that sarcastic voice in her head and trying to deny how crappy it all makes her feel. She listens to herself bawling like a ten-year-old, and thinks maybe she should take the day off tomorrow and go to the city with her mom. After all, the world is going to end, so what does she have to lose? She snatches a Kleenex from the box on the floor, wipes her eyes and blows her nose, but she’s not quite done yet. Listening to herself taking one more shuddering breath, sitting there in a Denny’s uniform, the ridiculousness of her situation hits her, and she looks around to make sure nobody is walking anywhere nearby.Twisting to look back over her right shoulder, she is embarrassed to see that her despair did indeed have an audience. Sitting on the tiny porch of a duplex apartment is an old woman wearing a bathrobe, fuzzy slippers, and a knitted ski cap with four points tipped with tassels.Her face is so wrinkled that it looks like crumpled parchment, bunched up around a gap-toothed grin. She is nodding and raising one claw-like hand toward Merridy, gesturing to come closer. Though she appears to be nearly one hundred years old and probably suffering from dementia, her eyes are clear and bright, a gleaming sapphire blue that communicate an unmistakable intelligence. Staring into those eyes, Merridy realizes that everything she is wearing is blue, though in wildly mismatched shades. She is certainly interested in Merridy, leaning forward to grab her walker and struggling to rise from the blue plastic chair crammed into a corner of the porch.Merridy is frozen in fascination, watching the old woman over her shoulder as she pulls herself upright and shuffles toward the porch steps, never breaking eye contact. It is only when the front of the walker scoots off the edge of the porch that Merridy spins around, throws open her door and bolts around the back of her car to keep the old woman from tumbling down the stairs.She hesitates by the bumper, one foot on the curb, when the old woman chuckles knowingly and points one gnarled finger at Merridy, as she stands poised precariously with one hand on her walker, still teetering with one leg hovering in the air.Now the wizened face loses all traces of merriment, the wrinkles rearrange themselves into a serious combination of furrowed brows and pursed lips, and the hand raises up to point over Merridy’s head to the ridge of mountains behind her, in the direction of her home.Still holding her gaze with those crystal blue eyes, the old woman croaks one word in a voice as dry and ancient as a mummy.“Go!”The spell is finally broken when the hand drops back down to maneuver the walker back around onto the porch and the old woman shuffles off through the door of her duplex, slamming it behind her.Merridy shakes her head and stares down into the gutter, wondering what the hell that was all about.“I do have to go, but I won’t be heading home for quite a while, yet. In fact, if I don’t get a move on, I’m gonna be late for the second time today.”She plops into the driver’s seat, searching for her keys on the cushion beside her. She finds them under Jack’s note, and snatches it up in her left hand as she jams the keys into the ignition and starts the car with a satisfying roar.A harsh laugh escapes her now, and she rips the note into several pieces and shoves it into the trash bag hanging off of the gearshift. “You’re right, you are too young for me, Jack. I should have been the one to cut you loose.” She pulls down the sun visor and checks out her face in the mirror. At least her eyes aren’t too red. Not that it matters. Nobody at Denny’s cares what’s going on with her, anyway.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>We Pretend They’re Fireworks</i> is a dystopian fiction novel about mental health and, just as importantly, the importance of not being afraid to reach out for help when you need it. Follow Lacey Matthews, the main protagonist, as she learns the importance of reaching out after periods of hardship.<br/><br/>My name is Hannah Kernal and I am the Author of <i>We Pretend They’re Fireworks</i>. I wrote this book because I believe that I have an important message about mental health that needs to be put out there! I really needed to hear something like this story when I was younger and dealing with mental health for the first time. I hope that I'll be able to pass on what I've learned to someone who might need it now or in the future.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be able to connect with Lacey and her closest friends as they figure out what the heck they’re doing. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for mental health in you. And then, ultimately, I want you to see this book as something that encourages you to reach out for help when you need it. There is no shame in asking for help!<br/><br/>In this book, you'll read about Lacey's journey with mental health, the importance of interpersonal relationships and support networks, and the equal importance of reaching out to that support network when she's having a difficult time, as well as how her learning these things is a positive influence on the people around her.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you love dystopian fiction or conversations about mental health.<br/><i>We Pretend They’re Fireworks</i> is a dystopian fiction novel that speaks to young adults and those who take an interest in mental health who are interested in increasing their mental wellbeing, who want to increase mental health awareness, and who want to read a story about both of those things</p>
<h2>The Book - We Pretend They’re Fireworks</h2>
<p>The novel comes from the point of view of Lacey Matthew, a half white and half Asian girl who is living in Pennyworth. The novel begins with her best friend, Blue, attempting to commit suicide. With limitations on how socially acceptable emotions are in her hometown, Lacey has to figure out how the heck she’s supposed to survive mental health issues (Blue’s and her own) and an onslaught of other issues coming down and around her.<br/><br/><i>We Pretend They’re Fireworks</i> takes place in a small American town, Pennyworth, where the people in power have decided that being anything but happy is out of the social norm. Citizens of Pennyworth are taught from a young age to keep their “chin up” in public and to deal with their “problems” on their own.<br/><br/>I decided to write this book as a dystopian fiction because it’s one of my absolute favorite genres to read, and because the genre really strongly lends itself to satire and social commentary, which is really what <i>We Pretend They’re Fireworks</i> is. It’s a social commentary about the fact that the social norm is one that shuns the reality of emotional vulnerability; something that everyone (including me!) has, unfortunately, been subject to historically.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Original Poetry, Original Art</span></h3>
<p>My goal is to create a beautiful, hardback poetry collection in collaboration with my friend and spectacular artist, Josie (see her art <a href=""https://jkoznarek.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>; the style will be similar to her Botanicals series).  </p>
<p>The reason I want to crowdfund this project is twofold: 1) I don't have enough money to fund it myself and still feed my children, and 2) I believe in the impact of community on art. Community is the very reason I've written any of the poetry in this book at all, and I want it to be the reason this book comes into the world.</p>
<p>I've been writing poetry since I was a kid, as a means of struggling with the tensions in my heart, my faith, and the world we live in -- tensions of hope and despair, faith and doubt, light and darkness, etc. My <a href=""https://chriswheelerwrites.com/category/poetry/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">poetry</a> has been published in Fathom, Barren Magazine, Kingdoms in the Wild, Reformed Worship, and Foundling House, among others. This will be my first self-published poetry collection, and I want to create something stunning.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am raising $1,200 to cover printing costs and fees, and to compensate Josie for her art and design work on the project.</p>
<p>You can consider your investment in this as a pre-order. </p>
<p>$2+ receive their name in the book credits as supporters.</p>
<p>$10+ receive an e-book version.</p>

<p>If you've gotten this far, I probably don't need to convince you of how important it is to make beautiful things, or write poetry, or support artists. Why are things like art, music, poetry, dance, cinema, or story important? Because if I told you something true you would understand the truth, but if I wrote you a poem about it or created a piece of art, you would <i>love</i> the truth. </p>
<p>This project is a work of love, truth, and hope. If you support it, you're putting something true and beautiful out into the world that you yourself will also get to enjoy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The primary risk factor will be timing. My wife and I (but yeah, she's doing all the hard work) are having a baby in November, so running this campaign right now means hopefully finalizing everything right around that time. So, yikes. But the good news is that it's already written.</p>
<p>My first goal is to get this book out by Christmas. My second goal is to get it out by early January. If I don't get it out to you by Christmas, I'll notify you immediately with a snappy haiku.</p>
<p>Of course, the secondary risk factor is not making enough money to put this into motion, in which case it will take longer to get everything going. So in some sense, timing will depend on that.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help me out by sharing this campaign with your friends via word of mouth and social media - even if you can't support financially! Getting the word out is HUGE, no lie. </p>

<p>And if you think of it, would you pray for all of this? My biggest prayer is that this book would be an encouragement to anyone struggling to find hope in darkness, doubt, or despair, that we would all believe that God's love for us is infinite and true.</p>
</div></div>","Original Poetry, Original Art
My goal is to create a beautiful, hardback poetry collection in collaboration with my friend and spectacular artist, Josie (see her art here; the style will be similar to her Botanicals series).  
The reason I want to crowdfund this project is twofold: 1) I don't have enough money to fund it myself and still feed my children, and 2) I believe in the impact of community on art. Community is the very reason I've written any of the poetry in this book at all, and I want it to be the reason this book comes into the world.
I've been writing poetry since I was a kid, as a means of struggling with the tensions in my heart, my faith, and the world we live in -- tensions of hope and despair, faith and doubt, light and darkness, etc. My poetry has been published in Fathom, Barren Magazine, Kingdoms in the Wild, Reformed Worship, and Foundling House, among others. This will be my first self-published poetry collection, and I want to create something stunning.

What We Need & What You Get
I am raising $1,200 to cover printing costs and fees, and to compensate Josie for her art and design work on the project.
You can consider your investment in this as a pre-order. 
$2+ receive their name in the book credits as supporters.
$10+ receive an e-book version.
$25+ receive the hardback, slip-covered copy, and I'll sign it if you're into that.
$50+ receive an original art print from the season of their choice. 
If you want to spend $200, you'll get all of that plus one of the original art pieces.
If I break even, I will be over the moon. If I make it only part of the way there, I will use any funds I receive toward eventually making this book a reality. If I go way beyond the goal, I will push any excess funds toward my next project, a poetry collection entitled Words for the Church.

The Impact

<p><i>Eleftherios’ Journey To Success</i> follows the incredible story of my grandfather, Eleftherios, in his journey of pursuing the American Dream. This book is a fictional account based on real-life events that took place in his life. <br/><br/>My name is Charles Euripides and I am the author of <i>Eleftherios’ Journey To Success</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to share my grandfather’s immigration journey and pathway to becoming a successful entrepreneur. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that anyone has the ability to become a successful entrepreneur.

As he grows up in this small, quaint village surrounded by family and friends, he remains passionate about pursuing the American Dream.

This book follows his pathway to becoming a successful entrepreneur in America, learning to adapt to a new culture, and overcoming adversities. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you want to learn about immigration, if you want to understand more about entrepreneurship, or if you would like to find out more about Greek-American culture.<br/><br/>Eleftherios’ Journey to Success speaks to immigrants and entrepreneurs who are grappling with adapting to new cultures and want to discover methods to becoming successful in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Eleftherios’ Journey to Success</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>

</ul>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Meet Tricia and Stephen Preston</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!  We are so glad you have decided to have a look at our campaign!   We're a husband and wife team who create and write children's stories.  We've recently finished writing and illustrating our second children's book entitled ""The Great Escape.""  We love to create!  We love to inspire creativity and wonder in everyone we meet!  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to see our book go from draft pages into print, we are hoping to raise $1500 through our Indiegogo campaign.  This will allow us to get 100 copies of our book printed and cover some of our costs in pre-production.  I'm sure you're asking ""What do I get out of this?""  Well, not only do you get the incredible and fulfilling chance to help someone see a dream come to pass, and help those who are caught in slavery,  but you also get to choose from some amazing thank you gifts and packages.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe that life should be filled with fun and adventure and lived in freedom.  The Great Escape is about being courageous and not being afraid to live in freedom!  There are many, many people of all ages who are trapped in many different forms of oppression.  We are praying that as children (and the young at heart) read this story, they will be inspired to be who they are designed to be....living a life that allows them to live free and overcome oppression.   One of our personal dreams is to make a living through our creations (artistic, written, and musically).  We would be grateful if you would stop by our website and have a look around (<a href=""http://www.funtasticalstudios.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.funtasticalstudios.com</a>).  There's also the added impact of supporting those in slavery around the world, as a portion of funds raised will be donated to International Justice Mission (<a href=""http://www.ijm.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ijm.ca</a>)</p>

Meet Tricia and Stephen Preston
Thanks for stopping by!  We are so glad you have decided to have a look at our campaign!   We're a husband and wife team who create and write children's stories.  We've recently finished writing and illustrating our second children's book entitled ""The Great Escape.""  We love to create!  We love to inspire creativity and wonder in everyone we meet!  
Tricia is the illustrator.  After years of painting and drawing,  she discovered her unique artistic style through doodling and began on a new journey of whimsy.  Stephen is a musician who brings his crazy sense of whimsical rhymes into the mix.   Together, they bring a sense of whimsical fun and adventure into everything they do.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Almost American</i> summarizes my first-hand experience as an American immigrant, as well as the stories of other successful entrepreneurial immigrants living in the United States. <br/><br/>My name is Billie Tuvshinbayar and I am the author of <i>Almost American</i>. My book has two simple goals — to inspire readers to achieve their dreams, and to empower others by sharing stories of those who overcame great adversity. To do this, I have embarked on a journey to share my own story; one that is unfinished and not famous. Throughout these personal stories, I share the ups and downs of my life, and share with you the influential people I admire and who teach me how to embrace being an immigrant.<br/><br/>Coming to America and living in this country is not as simple and easy as one might think. In this book I will share my story of coming to the States for the first time, learning English, exploring American culture, making friends, joining a sorority, getting my first corporate job, getting engaged to an American man, and how I am still viewed as a foreigner by many. I hope to show the obstacles most immigrants face and the issues they must overcome in their everyday lives. Ultimately, I hope this book can somehow be used as a tool to help people understand that immigrants are not a threat to this country, but rather the creators, inventors, and entrepreneurs that have significantly contributed to this great country’s society, economy, and culture.<br/> <h2>The Book - <i>Almost American</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in Three Parts:<br/><u>Part One</u>: WHO I AM AS A MONGOLIAN. In this section, readers will have the opportunity to learn more about my childhood in Mongolia and how it has shaped me to be the person I am today.<br/><br/><u>Part Two</u>: WHO I AM AS AN IMMIGRANT. In this section, readers will learn more about my life in America as an immigrant. Readers will learn what it is like to come to America for the first time, how different American culture is from other parts of the world, and my experiences with American work culture and the world of online dating...<br/><br/><u>Part Three</u>: WHO I WANT TO BE AS AN AMERICAN. In this section, readers will explore my observations of America, those who live in it, and what it means to be an American.<br/> </p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2020</li>

<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish in April 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.</p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Billie Tuvshinbayar is a proud immigrant living in the United States. She immigrated from Mongolia to the U.S. when she was 19 years old. After 10 years of living in the States and earning 2 bachelor’s degrees and one masters degree from Georgetown University, she finally had an opportunity to work for an American corporation — her lifelong dream. She is a firm believer that anyone can achieve their dreams, and upon realizing her passion for entrepreneurship and story telling, she decided to write <i>Almost American</i> to inspire others.<br/><br/>As an immigrant herself, Billie has met some of the hardest working people living in the States, whether they work in the cleaning industry or Silicon Valley. Often put in the spotlight during political campaigns, immigrants have been getting hit with a lot of negative publicity. In an effort to give a voice to other immigrants, Billie wanted to share positive stories of immigrants in this country as a way of defending those who have contributed so much to America’s economy.<br/><br/>Billie loves dogs and has always wanted to have one. Despite her fiancé being a cat person, she is hoping and planning to have a dog of her own when the time is right.</p>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Almost American summarizes my first-hand experience as an American immigrant, as well as the stories of other successful entrepreneurial immigrants living in the United States. My name is Billie Tuvshinbayar and I am the author of Almost American. My book has two simple goals — to inspire readers to achieve their dreams, and to empower others by sharing stories of those who overcame great adversity. To do this, I have embarked on a journey to share my own story; one that is unfinished and not famous. Throughout these personal stories, I share the ups and downs of my life, and share with you the influential people I admire and who teach me how to embrace being an immigrant.Coming to America and living in this country is not as simple and easy as one might think. In this book I will share my story of coming to the States for the first time, learning English, exploring American culture, making friends, joining a sorority, getting my first corporate job, getting engaged to an American man, and how I am still viewed as a foreigner by many. I hope to show the obstacles most immigrants face and the issues they must overcome in their everyday lives. Ultimately, I hope this book can somehow be used as a tool to help people understand that immigrants are not a threat to this country, but rather the creators, inventors, and entrepreneurs that have significantly contributed to this great country’s society, economy, and culture. The Book - Almost American

The book is written in Three Parts:Part One: WHO I AM AS A MONGOLIAN. In this section, readers will have the opportunity to learn more about my childhood in Mongolia and how it has shaped me to be the person I am today.Part Two: WHO I AM AS AN IMMIGRANT. In this section, readers will learn more about my life in America as an immigrant. Readers will learn what it is like to come to America for the first time, how different American culture is from other parts of the world, and my experiences with American work culture and the world of online dating...Part Three: WHO I WANT TO BE AS AN AMERICAN. In this section, readers will explore my observations of America, those who live in it, and what it means to be an American. 
What I Need & What You'll Get This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following: 
The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2020
The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)
The Copyediting for My Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish in April 2020

When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish
A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book
Your Name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)

</h2>
<p>This book will be part adventurous travelogue, part inspirational memoir and part travel guide. It will give people tips, advice and encouragement for following their travel dreams, or any kind of dreams. And there will be some useful practical tips too. Like how to travel safely in India.</p>
<p><em><strong>Roll out the magic carpet</strong></em> is not just for people who want to travel in India. It's for anyone who longs to follow their dreams. </p>
<p>A combination of <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em> and <em>Lonely Planet India</em>, this is the book that <strong><a href=""http://breathedreamgo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Breathedreamgo"">Breathedreamgo</a></strong> founder Mariellen Ward has longed to write for many years.</p>
<h2><strong>About Mariellen Ward</strong></h2>
<p>Writer and travel blogger Mariellen Ward travelled to India in 2005 to recover from grief and depression and to her surprise, she discovered she has a special affinity for a country that is famously hard on travellers. She spent six months travelling, volunteering, studying yoga, falling in love, blogging -- and having the time of her life.</p>
<p><strong>Mariellen learned the secret of how to travel safely and well in India, and she wants to share her story and tips with others. </strong></p>
<p>To travel well in India, Marellen had to learn many life lessons, and these she will share with you in <strong><em>Roll out the magic carpet</em></strong> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>cultivating an open, trusting and non-judgmental attitude</li>
<li>learning to go with the flow</li>
<li>seeing beauty in the essence of things</li>
<li>recognizing that everything is as it is meant to be</li>
<li>following safe travel practises</li>
</ul><p>The everyday realities of buying a train ticket, negotiating with an autorickshaw driver, confronting scenes of poverty, dealing with sensory overload and immersing in a new culture gave Mariellen a whole new perspective on life and taught her a wonderful skill: how to think happy.</p>
<p>Mariellen likens that first trip to a magic carpet ride. Since then, she has been back to India five times, and has amassed a wealth of travel and life experiences.</p>
<h3><strong>Travel tips and much more</strong></h3>
<p>This book will be a how-to, full of tips, advice, and pointers on travelling in general and travelling in India in particular. And it will also be encouraging, full of stories about overcoming fear, sadness and resistance.</p>

<h3><strong>Listen ... I want to tell you a story</strong></h3>
<p>To me, those are magic words. I grew up reading tales of fantasy and wonder, especially the 1,001 Tales of the Arabian Nights. As a child I believed in magic, and loved the tales of talking birds, and caves filled with treasure, and genies coming out of bottles.</p>
<p>But as an adult, I was hit hard by loss, and lost my faith in life and belief in magic and the power of dreams.</p>
<p>Until I decided to travel. When I really need to recharge my life, I went to India for six months. By myself. Was I scared. Hell, yes! But I went anyway, and everything turned out well. In fact, I felt like I was on a magic carpet ride for most of the whole six months.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about life, myself and how to travel on that trip. I also regained my belief in the magic of the universe.</p>
<p>Now I want to share my discoveries with others -- people who may also feel stuck, or depressed or like they can't pursue their dreams.</p>
<p>And that's what this book is all about.</p>

Think about: it's the only thing that hold us down and then because it is hard to fit it together with the other forces in nature into a united theory.</p>
<p>This is not another rigid compendium of physics, in a incomprehensible language and with elaborate mathematical demonstrations. This is a documentary reading in a human language, largely accessible, of the knowledge accumulated by humanity about our Universe and matter. You will argue that there are lots of such documentaries and there nothing more to learn. I have to argue here because there is no book or documentary that treats the full knowledge about the Universe in a unitary and accessible manner to give you the larger picture - the ""big picture"".</p>
<p>This book is intended for the reader from the age of 10 to 110 and from ""Jersey Shore"" to the scientific that (let's hope) has the open-mindedness to consider it worth reading, eager to discover alternative insights. The book will cover several disciplines from cosmology, astrophysics and  relativity to the quantum mechanics and chemistry into an attempt to fit it together so, do not expect elaborate mathematical demonstrations. For those interested in deeper analysis of the subject I will provide annexes and a structured bibliography. This book will provide the ignoring reader with ""five minutes crash courses"" into the mainstream theories like relativity and quantum mechanics, their historical evolution, with proof and criticisms and different perspectives done by alternative approaches, inviting the reader to pull his own conclusions rather than imposing them. I will try to be impartial, unbiased by my own convictions but I have to admit that I am no saint. This reading wants to be at a certain level ""all you need to know"" on a widespread field of knowledge but mostly an awakening of the reader's interest for some less circulating ideas in physics.</p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">The most important thing I have learned from one of my physics teachers is that if you formulate a problem correctly, that problem is almost solved. This book does not provide definitive answers for the simple reason that nobody could provide definitive answers (yet) but exposes the problems with a multitude of proposed solutions and the reasoning standing behind them. It is up to the reader's latitude to judge which solution has more commonsense - you'll be the judge.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Did the ""Big Bang"" ever occurred or is just the work of some physicists and mathematicians who started by considering the wrong hypothesis and due to their big ego they prefer to blow our universe apart rather than to admit they should consider alternative hypothesis?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">What is the mechanism that produces those invisible forces of gravitation, electrostatic and magnetic attraction that fascinates everybody?. Newton and Einstein found some ways to model the laws that govern those forces but they were not able to give an acceptable explication of the physical mechanism. It seems that the only intuitive explication of such mechanisms rest until today the one formulated by Fatio and Le Sage three centuries ago. We will see what it becomes today their theory.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">Is there an ""aether"" that fills all the space in Universe and if there is what exactly is it and how it behaves? What is that ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"" we hear about more and more often in an attempt of ""Big Bang"" adepts to save their dearest theory? </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;"">What exactly is the ""mass"" that gives weight to us and does not let us speed up as we would like?</span></p>

<p>Visit <a href=""http://www.whygravitysucks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.whygravitysucks.com</a> to read excerpts from the book and learn <a href=""http://kinetictoe.org/node/2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""How I've discovered gravity""</a>.</p></div>","Why the title? Come-on, literally or metaphorically speaking we are not wrong to say that gravity sucks. Think about: it's the only thing that hold us down and then because it is hard to fit it together with the other forces in nature into a united theory.
This is not another rigid compendium of physics, in a incomprehensible language and with elaborate mathematical demonstrations. This is a documentary reading in a human language, largely accessible, of the knowledge accumulated by humanity about our Universe and matter. You will argue that there are lots of such documentaries and there nothing more to learn. I have to argue here because there is no book or documentary that treats the full knowledge about the Universe in a unitary and accessible manner to give you the larger picture - the ""big picture"".
This book is intended for the reader from the age of 10 to 110 and from ""Jersey Shore"" to the scientific that (let's hope) has the open-mindedness to consider it worth reading, eager to discover alternative insights. The book will cover several disciplines from cosmology, astrophysics and  relativity to the quantum mechanics and chemistry into an attempt to fit it together so, do not expect elaborate mathematical demonstrations. For those interested in deeper analysis of the subject I will provide annexes and a structured bibliography. This book will provide the ignoring reader with ""five minutes crash courses"" into the mainstream theories like relativity and quantum mechanics, their historical evolution, with proof and criticisms and different perspectives done by alternative approaches, inviting the reader to pull his own conclusions rather than imposing them. I will try to be impartial, unbiased by my own convictions but I have to admit that I am no saint. This reading wants to be at a certain level ""all you need to know"" on a widespread field of knowledge but mostly an awakening of the reader's interest for some less circulating ideas in physics.
The most important thing I have learned from one of my physics teachers is that if you formulate a problem correctly, that problem is almost solved. This book does not provide definitive answers for the simple reason that nobody could provide definitive answers (yet) but exposes the problems with a multitude of proposed solutions and the reasoning standing behind them. It is up to the reader's latitude to judge which solution has more commonsense - you'll be the judge.
Did the ""Big Bang"" ever occurred or is just the work of some physicists and mathematicians who started by considering the wrong hypothesis and due to their big ego they prefer to blow our universe apart rather than to admit they should consider alternative hypothesis?
What is the mechanism that produces those invisible forces of gravitation, electrostatic and magnetic attraction that fascinates everybody?. Newton and Einstein found some ways to model the laws that govern those forces but they were not able to give an acceptable explication of the physical mechanism. It seems that the only intuitive explication of such mechanisms rest until today the one formulated by Fatio and Le Sage three centuries ago. We will see what it becomes today their theory.
Is there an ""aether"" that fills all the space in Universe and if there is what exactly is it and how it behaves? What is that ""dark matter"" and ""dark energy"" we hear about more and more often in an attempt of ""Big Bang"" adepts to save their dearest theory? 
What exactly is the ""mass"" that gives weight to us and does not let us speed up as we would like?
What exactly is the light, the photon, the electron and other particles real or imaginary proposed in different theories?
What are the ""Black Holes"" that appear evident mostly at the center of large galaxies?  Are they ""balls"" of very dense matter that generates a humongous gravity or are they just real holes in the distribution of matter, the kernel of a vortex like the eye of a hurricane that swallow the matter around and ejects it along its axis of rotation? 
Does really antimatter exist or is just matter that behaves differently?
Are there more dimensions of our space or parallel universes or they are only mathematical concepts only necessary to consider when solving some mathematical problems? Do necessarily all mathematical concepts translate into real things or phenomena?
What exactly is the ""electric charge""? There is a strange correlation between charge, mass and spin momentum of elementary particles. What that means?
That's a lot to ask but I think that everybody hears staff and sooner or later asks some of these questions and more you try to get answers, more questions rise. I always wonder if those who do not ask questions know everything or are completely ignorant. 
If you wonder where those invisible forces of gravitation, magnetism and electrostatics come from and you are not happy just blaming God for them, see different opinions formulated until today.
If you never heard about Le Sage's theory of gravitation or you are among the few who heard about it but you consider it obsolete only because ""you were told so"", you must absolutely read this book.

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>     My name is Kim Jarman and over the past few years I have studied art and design and am currently studying photography.</p>
<p>     My project is a children's story/picture book for younger readers, entitled Baxter The Bear. I want to publish this in a hard wearing glossy board book format. </p>
<p>     The idea came to me last year when I was in a book shop, looking for a book for my four year old nephew. I couldn't quite find what I was looking for, and then it suddenly dawned on me that I could illustrate and pen a story, with him in mind. </p>
<p>     I have been an avid reader myself from a very early age. My mother reminds me of how I would sit at the breakfast table reading aloud from the daily paper at just four years old - doubtless with a little difficulty but enthusiastically none the less.</p>
<p>     When I was nine years old, overseas with free time on my hands, I wrote a very long manuscript recounting the adventures of a teddy bear. There were no pictures back then, just chapter after chapter of adventures. So incorporating my artistic skills of today and drawing from memories of these early stories I am now in the process of putting together this story book. </p>
<p>     Baxter himself is a traditional sort of hero bear  - making good of his life after being thrown out by his owner for being a little shabby.</p>
<p>     Do you have a fond memory of a favourite book from your childhood? I do, vividly and I feel it's something to cherish throughout your life. I believe Baxter has what it takes to be the stuff of memories and compete amongst the monsters, aliens and naughty children who fill the bookshelves of today.</p>
<p>     If I reach my goal I will be able to publish 500 copies of Baxter. The money will also fund a new camera to achieve more professional standard of photography and a laptop for editing and everything else!  If I am lucky enough to exceed that goal I will be printing more copies for free distribution amongst needy children's organizations worldwide.</p>
<p>     With your donation I can make this happen. Such is my gratitude for this creative platform that every donation I receive will be rewarded, however small.</p></div>","Hi there!

<div>I grew up as part of a mighty big family, with 13 aunts and uncles 
on my mom's side. Just a few miles away from where I was raised in Lisbon, New York<a href=""http://www.lisbonny.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Town of Lisbon, NY""></a>, the LaBrake family farm existed for decades. ""The 
Farm"" was our sanctuary, and a place we enjoyed holidays, reunions and 
weekly Saturday evening visits. I also fondly remember summers as a teen there, putting in hay, a memory I know is shared by many of my relatives.<br/><br/>Thanks to many of my aunts and uncles remaining in the area, some operating their own farms, family gathering were often a monumental event. Dozens of people of all generations filled the farm house where the LaBrake 14 were raised. On some occasions, aunts and uncles (along with their children) made the day trip from another part of New York State or traveled from out of state just to be there.<br/> <br/>
</div>
<div>As a very young child, I was there when the last sibling got married and left the house for good. It was where I spent time helping my grandmother in the yard just days before she passed when I was just 16. At 30, I went there for the last time after the funeral of my grandfather. Although the property no longer remains in the family, my memories of The Farm are endless. <br/><br/>As I get older, my sense of pride grows stronger and I realize the immense value in being part of such a large and wonderful family. The level of devotion that my mom and her siblings demonstrate towards each other is a quality I typically do not see in families a fraction of their size. I’m especially grateful that, as of 2011, my mother and her 13 
brothers and sisters have passed 
the age of 55, and all are alive and well.<br/>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Agnes. Born in 1933, she lives in New Mexico.</div>
<div>Teresa. Born in 1934, she lives in New York.</div>
<div>George Junior. Born in 1936, he lives in New York.</div>
<div>Ella. Born in 1937, she lives in New York.</div>

<div>Patty Lou. Born in 1950, she lives in New York.</div>
<div>Kathy. Born in 1955, she lives in New York.<br/> 
</div><div>Their story is an extraordinary one. These eight girls and six 
boys, born to George LaBrake Sr. and Hilda LaBrake, have managed to beat
 the odds of mortality. As the eldest sibling approaches 80 years of 
age, I have structured a book project to document their family stories 
in specific segments, including childhood memories, reuniting as adults,
 and words of wisdom. While a family tree exists, there is no other 
place containing these family stories. As a professional writer and 
published author, I see the value of saving those stories in one 
easy-to-read collection. Readers will be fascinated by facts, such as 
only one of the 14 was born in a hospital and only one sibling is left 
handed. The stories about life in America during the 1930s, 1940s and 
1950s will also serve to entertain and educate readers who are

<div>The personal stories will be accompanied by a chapter that will

<div> </div>
<div>The project will begin with personal interviews with each member of

uncles, as well as my mother's home, to conduct a 3-hour interview of 
each person. I have developed a questionnaire containing 75 essential 
questions. I also plan to record the audio of these interviews digitally
 so they may be transcribed, with specific quotes used as part of the 
book.<br/><br/>I originally planned to conduct the interview of all 14 of them at once. I wanted to schedule it around the time of the annual LaBrake family reunion, which takes place at Lisbon Beach<a href=""http://www.lisbonny.net/camp.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Lisbon Beach""></a> in the summer. Yet not every sibling can make the trip every year. In fact, the ability for these 14 siblings to collectively come together has
 been challenging for their entire lives. In the last 30 years 
it's only happened three times: in April 1982 for their parents' 50th wedding 
anniversary, in August 2001 for the funeral of their father, and then in July 2008 as part of the annual LaBrake family reunion. </div>

interview an aunt and uncle there. My next trip will be to upstate New 
York where the majority of my aunts and uncles live. The 11 New York 
interviews can be conducted over the course of 4 days, including travel 
time between towns. The 14th and final interview will take place in New Jersey.<a href=""http://www.capemay.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Cape May, NJ""><br/></a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Photography will accompany the interviews. Each person will be

the property’s current owner.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once the interviews are complete, the process of writing the book 
will be limited to six months. Rather than writing a novel, the book 
will be structured by broader topics, such as Family Meals and Memories

photos will accompany some stories with a photo insert section in the 
middle of the book. The plan is to provide a self-published book in

</div><div><p> </p></div></div>","Our Story
I grew up as part of a mighty big family, with 13 aunts and uncles 
on my mom's side. Just a few miles away from where I was raised in Lisbon, New York, the LaBrake family farm existed for decades. ""The 
Farm"" was our sanctuary, and a place we enjoyed holidays, reunions and 
weekly Saturday evening visits. I also fondly remember summers as a teen there, putting in hay, a memory I know is shared by many of my relatives.Thanks to many of my aunts and uncles remaining in the area, some operating their own farms, family gathering were often a monumental event. Dozens of people of all generations filled the farm house where the LaBrake 14 were raised. On some occasions, aunts and uncles (along with their children) made the day trip from another part of New York State or traveled from out of state just to be there. 

As a very young child, I was there when the last sibling got married and left the house for good. It was where I spent time helping my grandmother in the yard just days before she passed when I was just 16. At 30, I went there for the last time after the funeral of my grandfather. Although the property no longer remains in the family, my memories of The Farm are endless. As I get older, my sense of pride grows stronger and I realize the immense value in being part of such a large and wonderful family. The level of devotion that my mom and her siblings demonstrate towards each other is a quality I typically do not see in families a fraction of their size. I’m especially grateful that, as of 2011, my mother and her 13 
brothers and sisters have passed 
the age of 55, and all are alive and well.

 
Agnes. Born in 1933, she lives in New Mexico.
Teresa. Born in 1934, she lives in New York.
George Junior. Born in 1936, he lives in New York.
Ella. Born in 1937, she lives in New York.
Neil. Born in 1938, she lives in New York.
Don. Born in 1939, he lives in New Mexico.
Jane. Born in 1941, she lives in New Jersey.
Sharon. Born in 1943, she lives in New York.
Bill. Born in 1945, he lives in New York.
Carl. Born in 1947, he lives in New York.
Harold. Born in 1948, he lives in New York.
Peg. Born in 1949, she lives in New York.
Patty Lou. Born in 1950, she lives in New York.
Kathy. Born in 1955, she lives in New York. 
Their story is an extraordinary one. These eight girls and six 
boys, born to George LaBrake Sr. and Hilda LaBrake, have managed to beat
 the odds of mortality. As the eldest sibling approaches 80 years of 
age, I have structured a book project to document their family stories 
in specific segments, including childhood memories, reuniting as adults,
 and words of wisdom. While a family tree exists, there is no other 
place containing these family stories. As a professional writer and 
published author, I see the value of saving those stories in one 
easy-to-read collection. Readers will be fascinated by facts, such as 
only one of the 14 was born in a hospital and only one sibling is left 
handed. The stories about life in America during the 1930s, 1940s and 
1950s will also serve to entertain and educate readers who are 
fascinated by biographical subject matter.
 
The personal stories will be accompanied by a chapter that will 
consist of statistical data and analysis, illustrating the rarity of 
siblings born before 1960 to experience this kind of longevity as a 
group. An expert in the field will contribute observations about what 
factors may have contributed to this phenomenon. The chapter will also 
reference the few other families in America with similar characteristics.

In the years in between, Marco goes through many ups and downs, including depression, giving speeches such as a TedTalk, getting in trouble with the law, being actively involved in great philanthropic causes, and becoming one of, if not the most, famous person in the world. Most importantly though, throughout his travels around the world he discovers the prevalence of what he calls the foreign national experience.<br/><br/>My name is Luca Mcleod and I am the author of <i>The Foreign National</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to challenge myself to something I had never done before. Initially, I was going to write about my life growing up in four different countries and how I have always felt like a foreigner, despite being a citizen of that country. Furthermore, I also come from a multinational and multiracial background which has made me ask more questions about my identity. In the end, I decided to use these elements as inspiration to write a fiction book, creating a world of its own and allowing more liberties than I would have been able to in a nonfiction piece. This book is meant to relate to the many experiences people around the world endure.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will gain a new perspective of the foreign national experience that is very common for many individuals. I hope this book inspires you to learn more about different countries, cultures, and people. Every one of us has a story that includes struggles, and as members of society, we should help each other through each of them.<br/><br/>Marco is an elementary school student in Barcelona trying to come up with a great idea. What should it be? He brain storms with his dad and eventually, they come up with a brilliant plan. He’s decided he’s going to find a way to connect students from around the world by implementing features such as a social media component, collaborative homework services, and by providing education accessibility to the poor, while also incorporating them into this ecosystem. Bingo! Off to the races.<br/><br/>However, as Marco’s popularity grows, his mental health and his close relationship with his dad take a blow. He suffers from depression and is eventually hospitalized for attempted suicide. Throughout his ongoing struggles and fame, Marco travels the world and tries to understand what makes the “different” people of a society, different and finds it’s within these contrasts, they become the same.<br/><br/>In the mix of fighting for great causes, such as climate change through his triathlon charity events, Marco also end ups fighting for his freedom. Once more, this much beloved national figure spirals in a downward trajectory.<br/><br/>Struggling to find meaning in life, Marco heads to the East as a last resort. After years of separation from the Western world, his dad visits him in Thailand to share that he only has a few weeks left to live, but before he can tell this news, Marco is kidnapped in one of the busiest markets in the world. No one knows why, and no one knows by who.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy success stories, drama, and learning about different cultures.<br/><br/><i>The Foreign National</i> speaks to various communities around the world who want to grapple with topics such identity and mental health in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The Foreign National</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><ul>
<li>What does it mean to be a foreign national?</li>
<li>How do our thoughts and behaviors affect our relations with others?</li>
<li>Why do we think that we are so different from each other?</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with you, my readers. Despite Marco’s fame and success, he is just as vulnerable and flawed as anyone else. In this fiction book, I write about important—and difficult—issues that we all face in our lives, but often feel isolated and alone in. I can’t wait for us to build this community together, through the world and characters of The Foreign National.</p><p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p><i>The Foreign National</i> will be published with <a href=""https://www.newdegreepress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Degree Press</a>.

<p><i>The Healthcare Conversation: Navigating the U.S. Health System </i>is filled with productive discussions and analyses about complicated topics of the healthcare system that have been untouched. This book strives to answer questions that have puzzled everyday Americans for years:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Why is healthcare so expensive in the United States?”</li>
<li>“What is the government doing to aid patient consumers?”</li>
<li>“How can we advocate for better healthcare?”</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I have intertwined my own personal struggles with understanding the complex healthcare system with anecdotes and perspectives from real-life professional interviewees to ensure the inclusion of a diversity of people into the healthcare discussion.<br/><br/>My name is Linh Vo and I am the author of The Healthcare Conversation. I wrote this book because I believe that the information regarding the status and nature of our healthcare industry should be understandable and readily available to all Americans.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to reclaim your purchasing power from the industry and utilize that to make better decisions regarding your health plan. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for self-empowerment and education. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better navigate/coordinate your own healthcare and become smarter consumers of the system.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the progression and nature of the healthcare industry, the problems within the system, and the steps needed to succeed as patient consumers. You'll hear real stories from patients and healthcare professional interviewees below:</p>
<ul>
<li>George Chaux, the board-certified medical director of the Lung Transplant Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, explains how to have successful doctor-patient interactions as he attends to his patients’ needs by ensuring that they are comfortable participating in their own healthcare plan.</li>
<li>Robert Longyear, the director of product management and delivery at digital health technology company Montuno Software, discusses complex topics such as the methodology of healthcare consumerism, viable solutions on how we can go about fixing healthcare, as well as the controversial ideas of why large for-profit companies are not motivated by greedy incentives.</li>
<li>Sharon Donald, the account receivable supervisor at nursing facility Sun Mar Healthcare, accounts the struggle of losing healthcare support from the government for her husband’s terminally illness makes her question American spending on healthcare and whether a universal/single-payer healthcare system may be part of the solution.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are in your twenties and early thirties and are just starting to schedule their own doctor appointments, paying their own bills, or coordinating their own healthcare plan. Although this is my specific target, this book is beneficial for all Americans who want to have their unanswered questions not only answered, but analyzed in a critical light.<br/><br/><i>The Healthcare Conversation</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to young American adults who are looking at medical bills and healthcare expenses for the first time.</p>

The book is about navigating the healthcare system by understanding its current status and nature, and then harnessing that knowledge to become smarter, better-informed patients and consumers. I wrote it because I want to educate patients and empower them to better understand the different entities that make up their overall health. My book will publish in March 2020.

The story traces the journey of an aspiring political journalist as she tries to live alone for the first time in the largest city of India. In the process of tracking the story of Technology and AI, she draws a parallel to changes in the lives of women over the last three generations in the country. I hope to present a narrative about self-discovery and coping with change and challenges, while discussing one of the biggest achievements and problems of this century.<br/><br/>My name is Hrishita Bapuram and I am the author of <i>Dotted Lines</i>. I wrote this book because I believe that the only way to drive change and to make the world a better place is to start talking about it. Only when we converse and deliberate will we ever be able to understand the true gravity of any circumstance. This book is especially relevant in the Indian demographic because the number of working women in India fell from 42.7% in 2004-05 to a staggering 23.3% in 2017-18. This is a serious problem that needs to be understood at a fundamental level and immediately addressed because unequal representation will lead to a vicious cycle of suppression.<br/><br/>My hope is that reading this book will change the way you’ve traditionally viewed social norms, as well as motivate you to set a greater goal for your community and create a plan of action to achieve it.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of women empowerment, self-discovery, growth and, above all, finding your place in a world that’s constantly changing through narratives like:</p><ul>
<li>Navigating living alone for the first time in a city that houses 12.6 million other dreamers.</li>
<li>Identifying your greater goal in an empowerment process by simply reflecting on how change has improved your world. Then, figuring out what you can do to drive that change further.</li>
<li>Understanding the implication of the increasing dependence on technology on our social constructs and relationships.</li>
</ul><p><br/><strong>FOR ALL:</strong><br/>You will love this book if you feel strongly about ensuring that our world is a much safer, encouraging, and equal space for all of humanity — regardless of gender, race, caste, or creed.<br/><br/>This book is for anyone who wants to learn about the Indian culture - its complicated diversity and undeniable spirit. Its celebration and vibrance, not as a tourist, but in the simplicity and intricacy of the people and their lives.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Dotted Lines inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p><p> </p><ul>
<li>If we as a society have truly evolved or if we simply put on a façade of a progressive civilization that is still caught up in a dated, tangled mess?</li>
<li>If the technology we’re building today is a system evolved enough to understand the complicated nature of human emotions and social constructs?</li>
<li>Why are more and more women choosing not to work anymore?</li>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>The Cave of Appalachia is a story about fear, intrigue, secrecy, and overcoming trauma.</p>
<p><br/>My name is Kyle Curry and I am the author of The Cave of Appalachia. I wrote this book because of spite over the phrase “horror is dead”. Now, spite isn't enough to write a good story, but writing about the two most prevalent issues of today — fear and mental illness — very much is.<br/><br/>My hope for this book is to give insight to those on the outside of mental illness. For those going through it, it is a message that there are people trying to and willing to help you, but you have to let them, but still be attentive of those that want to take advantage of you. To all of you that read this, I want you to learn that fear is a liar.</p>
<p>The Cave of Appalachia details the story of three friends, Kord, and two siblings Clarkson and Theresa, who decide to trespass and explore a forbidden cave in Late August. However, they quickly come to face their decision by a cave-in trapping Kord inside. Unable to rescue their friend, the siblings have to bare the consequence of their actions and seek help. Their help though comes in the form of a Mayor with fiery spirit but little power, a secretive ""Mr. Martin"" who fights with them every step of the way, and a Lt. Governor who never follows the norm. A race and competition soon forms on four fronts, all to rescue Kord who has now come in contact with another unknown individual in the cave, but a question still remains: Can Kord be rescued before the incoming summer storms, or might he soon succumb to the horrors in the cave?</p>
<h3>The Reader (You!)</h3>
<p>You will love this book if you like horror, are entertained by mystery, and want to see the inside of an individual’s mind who suffers from mental illness.<br/><br/>The Cave of Appalachia speaks to people dealing with fears, people who are suffering with mental illness and those who personally know the former and are trying to grapple with understanding and providing help for mental illness in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that The Cave of Appalachia inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do I know someone with mental illness and am I helping?</p></li>
<li><p>Are we able to control our responses to fear?</p></li>
<li><p>How might irrational fear and misunderstanding of mental illnesses be damaging our world?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing irrational fear, mental illness, will change us all for the better.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Kyle Curry is a writer of horror and general fiction. He’s also an Eagle Scout, and a senior at Edinboro University, majoring in English and minoring in Cinema and Business Administration.<br/><br/>Curry wishes for his book to speak with the reader on how an individual with mental illness can feel: Alone. Alone with only fear to accompany them in a world that seemingly gets more and more dangerous. He wishes for the reader to walk away with this, as well as enjoying an intense, thrilling story.<br/><br/>In his spare time, Curry likes to watch movies, videos, and shows, read books and graphic novels, listen to music of various genres, research fringe topics he stumbles across — either on accident or on purpose — and shop online for things he’ll never be able to justify buying- such as a $500 toaster...so your basic 21yr old guy. Apart from staying inside, Curry also enjoys gardening, walking through parks, hanging out with friends, and scaring the bear that scares him during the night while taking out the trash.<br/><br/>For more information that doesn’t sound like a dating profile, you can connect with Kyle Curry at kyle.curry.formal@gmail.com and on social media through Twitter: @quackeritz and Instagram: kyle.curry99 .<br/> </p>

<h3>The Novella Series</h3>
<p>The Devil Brigade has been a story that has gone through many different identities. It started as a simple short story, worked itself into a massive novel, then broke down into a series. Mostly because of my main character, Ben.</p>
<p>Ben is a young boy who travels the country, carnival to carnival, with the Devil Brigade, a group of sideshow freaks who were compiled by the strange Ringmaster Tom. The year is 1890 and freak shows are of high popularity in the US. Carnival goers rush the stage to see what Ringmaster has on display for them, what oddities will leave them awake at night to ponder. Ben is the most popular freak on display, known to the crowds as Bubonic Boy: Black Death - Alive! Although Ben is always a highlight on display, he starts to worry that this is all life has to give him. He cannot remember how he wound up becoming an oddity or how he even wound up with Ringmaster. He begins to seek answers and comes across dark, strange secrets that could cost him his life...</p>
<p>I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that each novella is a separate entity in Ben's mission to piece together his memories and find out who he really is. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With your help, I can bring the strange, macabre carnival to life and share it with the world! The debut novella is already written and ready to go with the second one already in the works. I just need the funds for a professional edit, printing, and e-book release!</p>

<h3>An excerpt from ""The Devil Brigade""</h3>
<p>Here are the first few pages of the first novella to give you a sample of my writing. This is the introduction to the whole series, where we first meet Ringmaster Tom and Bubonic Boy, who you will be getting to know much more. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Chapter 1</span></p>
<br/><p>Ringmaster stepped out from behind a fringed curtain and twirled his cane between long, crooked fingers. The wooden piece spun fluidly, helicoptering back and forth from thumb to pinky in the dead, humid air. It was Saturday and it was just about time for the first show of the night. His dark, penciled-in eyes seemed to sparkle as he cleared his throat and barked out a deep, booming call.  ""Step right up, step right up. Ladies and gentlemen, strangers and friends, why don't you come close and stay for awhile? The Devil Brigade is here!""</p>
<p>His cane’s spinning stopped and the end flipped back behind him as he lowered himself into a long, dramatic bow, arms straight out to his sides and his head down by his hips. When he pulled himself back up, there was not a soul watching. The audience was non-existent, just men and women strolling past his stage, dust rising from the dead country grass from their thick boots.  They all seemed to ignore the sickly green banner slung across the stage from frame to frame: ""Freak Show of 1890 - presented by Ringmaster Tom!"" The stage was held up with large, swollen wooden poles and filthy curtains that obscured most of the rotted wooden floor. Whether or not they ignored him or just were not interested, the crowd was all the same, filled with men in long shirts and black hats and women with fluffed, short sleeves fanning themselves. They kept their heads turned away from blood red posters splattered with  strange and grotesque bodies posed in awkward positions like melted wax statues. Phrases like ""Leave your disbelief at home!"" and ""Those faint of heart - keep walking!"" lined the disturbing images.</p>
<p>Ringmaster removed his oversized black top hat and scratched at frizzy white hair that pointed wildly in all directions.  He rolled the hat back and forth between his fingers in the same motion as his cane, magically spinning the tattered thing like a basketball.  As he spun the hat in deep thought, watching the men and women ignore the stage, he wondered which act would be the best to catch the crowd by surprise, but not climax too quickly.  This town didn’t seem like much of a freak show kinda place - they were hardened, tired people who needed fun and excitement to help them forget their factory jobs and starvings children, not the weird and macabre arts.  For Ringmaster Tom, it was art just to keep the fans engaged, to give the best performance every night without losing stragglers and families pulling away one by one.  It took him years to master his technique and perfect the opening and closings, those moments that were remembered far more than the middle,  and he took great pride in his work. His freaks were some of the best this year and he knew that any one of them would be a decent introduction, but who would be best for last? The Throwaways tonight, his group of freaks he rounded up locally, were a decent bunch, full of grotesqueness that would breathe some strange life into the act.  Maybe he could stage them last, or maybe filter them throughout his traveling show.</p>
<p>He knew that before he could do any of that, he needed to draw some eyes to the stage. What good is a freak show without the gasps and whispers and most importantly, the word of mouth? He stepped loudly and deliberately across the platforms of the stage, each boot step thudding and echoing. The hat continued to roll in his fingers. He needed the perfect catch to call out to, someone charming and engaging to intrigue passing eyes and keep them stopping, one after the other. </p>
<p>As if on cue, a young woman in a frilly white dress stepped up to the side of the stage. Her skirts seemed to bounce heavenly among the lanterns that lit the carnival night. Her face was round and sweet, a lost cherub in this sad town. Her hair was in tight blonde curls that snapped back and forth around her neck and down the front of her lacy, white blouse.  Not a single speck of the park seemed to cling to her and she stood radiantly among the sad, tired faces. She held a wispy mound of fairy floss candy as she stared at the poster on the front of the stage. The image was covered in black, bold question marks and words that asked, ""Who is Bubonic Boy?""</p>
<p> Her head cocked to the side and she took a bite of her candy as she read.  Ringmaster stared at her and wondered if his prayers had been answered. She would be perfect for catching eyes.</p>
<p>He stopped pacing and knelt down in front of her, a few feet above her thick blonde curls.  He put his top hat back on his head and pressed his cane into his multicolored coat, addressing her with a respectful bow. ""My, my, my! What a beautiful girl! I've been all over the world and have never seen such beauty as yours!"" </p>
<p>He smiled a charming smile and realized she, in fact, was abnormally beautiful. Almost like a doll, unrealistically large blue eyes and porcelain skin that radiated under the moonlight. She smiled back at him flirtatiously and giggled to herself.  He was caught off guard by her receptiveness but continued to croon. ""Who brought such a lovely young lady here tonight?”</p>
<p>She looked behind herself shyly, then back up to Ringmaster. ""Nobody. Just me tonight.""</p>
<p>He continued to hold his smile as he removed his cane from inside his coat jacket and on the top of the cane’s knob a small white dove sat, fluttering its wings.  ""It's never smart to let a little birdie be by herself...she could fly away!"" He shook the cane and the dove startled and flew. </p>
<p>The woman pointed up at the bird and laughed, surprised. ""Wow! How did you do that?!""  A few turned their heads and looked at her, then up at the bird she pointed to. They stopped moving and began to listen and watch. Ringmaster’s voice got a little louder.</p>
<p>""I've learned many things in my travels, my dear. Will you be so kind as to stay awhile and see what else I have discovered?""  </p>
<p>“Sure! I would love to. Something tells me this will be a fun show.”</p>
<p> A few others began to stand in front of the stage and with one stopped person, another </p>
<p>stopped and soon the gathering began. They murmured and pointed at the signs and posters curiously, the hum of the crowd rising.  Ringmaster waited until he counted fifty or sixty heads. He was in disbelief of how quickly she brought in a crowd. If I could only have a type like her at every show, I’d be doing the best business of my life. </p>
<p>He adjusted his top hat, pulled at the lapels of his jacket, cleared his throat, and opened his mouth to address his waiting audience.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Inside a dirty covered wagon sat a boy of no more than sixteen years old.  He was among dishes, colorful props, boxes of costumes and makeup, and lots of other clutter. In his corner where he sat, he picked up a broken hand mirror and stared into it as he took a deep breath. He glared at the reflected fragments of himself, stretched this way and that, spotted and grotesque. He sighed and tried to think of what day it was. The crowd he heard Ringmaster conjuring suggested the business of a Saturday, but sometimes Friday could be busy too. He couldn’t remember if they did shows last night and that depressed him. The days seemed to all blur together at this point after doing so many for as long as he had. His knees were sore and beginning to bruise, so he assumed he probably did some kind of stunt yesterday. It must be Saturday.</p>
<p>He knew it didn’t make a difference. No matter the day or week or year, he would always do four shows a night. One show every hour. He would only be on stage for two minutes, sometimes three if the crowd loved him. Those minutes felt like hours though, especially because he didn’t have a choice. There were no sick days and no time off - he had to do what Ringmaster told him to and that was that.</p>
<p>The wagon he sat in was huge, large enough to carry the props and workers, yet it still always felt so cluttered and claustrophobic.  At the moment it was empty  as the others were already behind the stage, ready for the first show of the night. They had pushed and nudged him to come along and wait with them, but he wasn’t in the mood yet.  His costume was simple and easy anyway - he could just grab everything and get up there a few minutes just before he went on. He stopped caring if he was late because realistically he knew it it would only be more suspense for the audience to wait for him to get up there.. At least that was always his excuse with Ringmaster whenever it was brought into question and the whip was drawn. </p>
<p>The boy put down the mirror and glanced over at the flyer for the carnival. He  wanted to read it from where it sat, but the candle light was too dim to make out any of the small print. All he could see was the large, printed letters that said:</p>
<p>BUBONIC BOY: BLACK DEATH - ALIVE!</p>
<p> The letters were bold and black, standing out amongst the other images and phrases plastered across the paper. He knew underneath the title was a drawing of what he supposedly looked like. The drawing was horrific - a spotted creature with gigantic red eyes, a mouth curled in a snarl with rotted teeth and fangs exposed. Although he knew he didn’t look like that, he couldn’t help but feel there was some reality to it all. If he saw that creature wandering the streets, he would gasp and point just like the crowd gasped and pointed at him. He knew he could hold up the flyer to the candle to get a good look at it for the millionth time, but he asked himself what purpose it would serve except to make him more depressed.</p>
<p>Candles were the only source of light in the wagon, unless Ringmaster was feeling generous and would let them pull the cover of the wagon off a bit for some sunlight and air. He tended not to allow this though for fear of others seeing the freaks outside of the show and starting terrible rumors. The boy wasn’t exactly sure what could possibly be said that already hadn’t been, but he took Ringmaster’s word for it. He’d be doing this show forever, for much longer since  he’d been around, so he must know what’s best. </p>
<p>The boy could feel the hot, dusty air blowing through the holes in the wagon’s canopy  and he smelled sugary candy that probably tasted delicious.  He wasn't sure how it tasted because he never had it, but the smell was always the same at every carnival and it always smelled nice and refreshing.</p>

An excerpt from ""The Devil Brigade""
Here are the first few pages of the first novella to give you a sample of my writing. This is the introduction to the whole series, where we first meet Ringmaster Tom and Bubonic Boy, who you will be getting to know much more.

She smiled back at him flirtatiously and giggled to herself.  He was caught off guard by her receptiveness but continued to croon. ""Who brought such a lovely young lady here tonight?”
She looked behind herself shyly, then back up to Ringmaster. ""Nobody. Just me tonight.""
He continued to hold his smile as he removed his cane from inside his coat jacket and on the top of the cane’s knob a small white dove sat, fluttering its wings.  ""It's never smart to let a little birdie be by herself...she could fly away!"" He shook the cane and the dove startled and flew. 
The woman pointed up at the bird and laughed, surprised. ""Wow! How did you do that?!""  A few turned their heads and looked at her, then up at the bird she pointed to. They stopped moving and began to listen and watch. Ringmaster’s voice got a little louder.
""I've learned many things in my travels, my dear. Will you be so kind as to stay awhile and see what else I have discovered?""  
“Sure! I would love to. Something tells me this will be a fun show.”
 A few others began to stand in front of the stage and with one stopped person, another 
stopped and soon the gathering began. They murmured and pointed at the signs and posters curiously, the hum of the crowd rising.  Ringmaster waited until he counted fifty or sixty heads. He was in disbelief of how quickly she brought in a crowd. If I could only have a type like her at every show, I’d be doing the best business of my life. 
He adjusted his top hat, pulled at the lapels of his jacket, cleared his throat, and opened his mouth to address his waiting audience.
* * *
Inside a dirty covered wagon sat a boy of no more than sixteen years old.  He was among dishes, colorful props, boxes of costumes and makeup, and lots of other clutter. In his corner where he sat, he picked up a broken hand mirror and stared into it as he took a deep breath. He glared at the reflected fragments of himself, stretched this way and that, spotted and grotesque. He sighed and tried to think of what day it was. The crowd he heard Ringmaster conjuring suggested the business of a Saturday, but sometimes Friday could be busy too. He couldn’t remember if they did shows last night and that depressed him. The days seemed to all blur together at this point after doing so many for as long as he had. His knees were sore and beginning to bruise, so he assumed he probably did some kind of stunt yesterday. It must be Saturday.
He knew it didn’t make a difference. No matter the day or week or year, he would always do four shows a night. One show every hour. He would only be on stage for two minutes, sometimes three if the crowd loved him. Those minutes felt like hours though, especially because he didn’t have a choice. There were no sick days and no time off - he had to do what Ringmaster told him to and that was that.
The wagon he sat in was huge, large enough to carry the props and workers, yet it still always felt so cluttered and claustrophobic.  At the moment it was empty  as the others were already behind the stage, ready for the first show of the night. They had pushed and nudged him to come along and wait with them, but he wasn’t in the mood yet.  His costume was simple and easy anyway - he could just grab everything and get up there a few minutes just before he went on. He stopped caring if he was late because realistically he knew it it would only be more suspense for the audience to wait for him to get up there.. At least that was always his excuse with Ringmaster whenever it was brought into question and the whip was drawn. 
The boy put down the mirror and glanced over at the flyer for the carnival. He  wanted to read it from where it sat, but the candle light was too dim to make out any of the small print. All he could see was the large, printed letters that said:
BUBONIC BOY: BLACK DEATH - ALIVE!
 The letters were bold and black, standing out amongst the other images and phrases plastered across the paper. He knew underneath the title was a drawing of what he supposedly looked like. The drawing was horrific - a spotted creature with gigantic red eyes, a mouth curled in a snarl with rotted teeth and fangs exposed. Although he knew he didn’t look like that, he couldn’t help but feel there was some reality to it all. If he saw that creature wandering the streets, he would gasp and point just like the crowd gasped and pointed at him. He knew he could hold up the flyer to the candle to get a good look at it for the millionth time, but he asked himself what purpose it would serve except to make him more depressed.
Candles were the only source of light in the wagon, unless Ringmaster was feeling generous and would let them pull the cover of the wagon off a bit for some sunlight and air. He tended not to allow this though for fear of others seeing the freaks outside of the show and starting terrible rumors. The boy wasn’t exactly sure what could possibly be said that already hadn’t been, but he took Ringmaster’s word for it. He’d be doing this show forever, for much longer since  he’d been around, so he must know what’s best. 
The boy could feel the hot, dusty air blowing through the holes in the wagon’s canopy  and he smelled sugary candy that probably tasted delicious.  He wasn't sure how it tasted because he never had it, but the smell was always the same at every carnival and it always smelled nice and refreshing.

What is Need & What You Get
I'm not here to make lots of money - I just want to share a story that I think will be enjoyed! I won't ask for thousands of dollars because I don't need it for this project (although, if you really want to throw fistfuls of hundreds at me, don't hesitate). I'm asking for my absolute minimum so I can release a professional piece of fiction while keeping it accessible to audiences.  I intend on selling my ebook and paperback for very costs and spreading the good word about the Brigade!!
Here are some of the perks I am offering if you are so generous as to help me fund this series:

$5 - You have my eternal gratitude! I will send a postcard featuring the debut novella cover (designed by the talented Marissa Letterio) expressing my thanks! You also get a PDF copy of the first novella that you can read on your kindle, nook, or computer.


$20 - You receive a postcard and a signed paperback copy of the debut novella! 

$40 - You get the postcard, PDF, signed paperback copy of the debut novella, and a PDF of the second novella (the date is TBD, but expect it within six months. I will stay in contact about this!)

$50 - Now we're getting serious, kids. I'll send along the postcard, PDF, signed paperback copy of the debut novella, a PDF of the second novella (TBD), and the promo poster signed!

$60 - Wow! Not only do I love ya lots, but I will give you the postcard, PDF of both the debut novella and the second (TBD), a signed paperback copy of the debut novella, a signed poster, and I will write you in as a character somewhere in the series (we can discuss this at your leisure).

$80 - You really like me! Jeez. Postcard, PDFs of the debut novella and second novella (TBD), a signed paperback copy of the debut novella, signed poster, I'll write you into the series (we can discuss this at your leisure), and a special thank you as a fundraiser in the Thank You section of each released novella.

$100 - You're too kind. Seriously. Not only do you get all of the previously mentioned perks (postcard, PDFs of the two novellas, signed paperback, signed cover poster, written into the series as per your suggestion, and a special thank you), I will send you a signed paperback version of each novella as they are released (please remember that these are TBD, but trust me. If you donate $100 or over, I won't forget about ya!)

PLEASE NOTE: I can only fund this if my entire goal is met. If the goal is not met, the money is not donated and the perks are not released. But we can do this!



Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>What We Need </h3>

<h3>Max the Pirate Cat - The Book!</h3>
<p>In March 2018 I wrote a song for a Pirate song competition. Ultimately I didn't enter the competition because I was in the studio recording my debut album ""A Different Kind Of Normal"", but I decided to start performing the song anyway. Since then I've sung ""Max the Pirate Cat"" at almost every gig I've played - sometimes more than once! </p>
<p>Last August I created a video to accompany the song and people started asking me if there would be a book of Max's story. I immediately loved the idea and wanted to make it a reality, but gigs, festivals and my second solo album had to take priority. </p>
<p>Then lockdown happened, and now the time has come for Max's story to appear in print! </p>
<p>I considered trying to go through a publisher, but as an unknown author in such uncertain times this wasn't a viable option, so I'm going to produce and publish the book myself. </p>
<p>In order to reproduce the level of detail on the original A3 drawings the book will be A4 landscape format, with the picture on one page and text on the facing page (see mockup below). In order for the book to be an item to treasure I intend to produce it in hardback. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1600512527/dxzn3yoj2pmcjozhuhs5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I've worked out the costs of this project and calculated the bare minimum I need in order to get this off the ground, and for that reason this is an all-or-nothing project. I desperately want Max in print to become a reality, so am giving myself the added incentive of <i>needing</i> to reach 100% funding...or else it won't happen!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Journey from Song - through Video - to Book!</h3>
<p>Recording a CD is the easy part, it turns out! Some of you will know that the original pictures for the video took me an entire year to create, because at that time I was a very inexperienced artist. However, I since drew the digital art for my second album ""WolfSong"" in just three weeks, and thus I'm confident that I can meet the challenge of drawing the new pictures that I intend to include in Max - The Book. </p>
<p>During the campaign, I shall be working on the new pictures, as well as editing and modifying some of the original drawings that I feel can be improved upon. My plan is that I will have the book ready to send for print within 2 weeks of the campaign ending, and thus I hope to have copies with you by mid-December. In a year when we aren't certain who we'll be able to invite into our homes, why not bring Max home with you for Christmas this year? </p>
<h3>Not just a book...</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Max started out as a song, and the book will include a CD single of the original recording. On top of this, I thought about what else would make this project unique and help everyone feel involved. </p>
<p><u>Everyone</u> will receive my undying gratitude for your support and involvement. You will also get to vote on which picture we will use for the front cover art. </p>
<p><u>Digital ""Cabin Boy"" supporters</u> will receive downloads of the ""Max the Pirate Cat"" MP3 and the cover art. </p>
<p><u>""Deckhand"" supporters</u> will receive a signed, individually numbered copy of the book and CD set.</p>
<p><u>Bronze ""Quartermaster"" supporters</u> will receive the signed book and CD, will be named as Quartermaster supporters in the back of the book.</p>
<p><u>Silver ""First Mate"" supporters</u> will receive all of the above, be named as First Mate supporters and will also receive an A4 print of the chosen front cover art.</p>
<p><u>Gold ""Captain"" supporters</u> will receive all of the above, will be named as Captain supporters and in addition you or a loved one will be immortalised in the book as a pirate or other character in Max's story. For this level, I'll need you to send me one or more good-quality digital photos to work from once the campaign is finished. If you want me to draw someone else, please get their (or their parent/guardian's) permission first! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk is not reaching 100% funding, because if that doesn't happen, the project won't go ahead. I chose this type of funding because I want the incentive to push myself to achieve the goal, and also so that you have the reassurance that the project won't fail due to lack of funds. Having successfully crowdfunded my debut album ""A Different Kind Of Normal"" I'm confident that I have the experience and support to achieve this. </p>
<p>Most of the pictures are already drawn and the new ones are planned. My biggest challenge is going to be making sure my Gold-level backers are happy with their pictures and placement within the book, which is why there will be a maximum of 10 new pirates, smugglers or tavern drinkers at this level. </p>
<p>I've already obtained quotes from three different book publishers and factored in the price of shipping, indiegogo fees and purchasing a barcode for the finished book into my funding calculations. However, <strong>if I exceed my target</strong> sufficiently I will be upgrading the book production, firstly from 130 gsm to 170 gsm paper and then including more pages over and above the planned 56. </p>
<p>The book will be a limited edition, so I don't know until the end of the campaign how many I will print, nor whether it will be available after the crowdfunder has finished; so if you'd like a copy, please back me now! Each copy will be signed and individually numbered as well as including any other perks you may have chosen. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We're all living in strange times right now and I understand if you can't contribute. However, please support me by telling your friends about the campaign and sharing this page far and wide. </p>
