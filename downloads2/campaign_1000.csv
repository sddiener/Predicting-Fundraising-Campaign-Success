<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Your generous giving will help me be able to work with the local university's specimen collection and create more scientific based apocalyptic art as well as art based on the culture and life of Argentina, home of my grandmother. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>I will be working and selling my own possessions in order to pay for rent back at home while I am gone, but I need your help in order to make this dream a reality. Here is the financial breakdown:</p>
<p>$2000 will go to purchasing a plane ticket to Beunos Aires and a ticket coming back to the States.</p>
<p>$3000 will go to the Residency as part of their fees for their solo exhibition program for two months. </p>
<p>$1000 will go towards living (such as groceries) and traveling fees for two months in Argentina based on the previous artists who have gone.</p>
<p>Any extra will go towards art supplies, the more I am able to raise, the more art I can make! </p>
<p><b>Art Supplies with Additional Funding:</b></p>
<p>$20 - Paint Thinner and other supplies I will not be able to fly with</p>
<p>$270 - Portable French Easel to fit more paint/paintbrushes for traveling while painting</p>
<p>$120 - Portable Canvas/Panel Carrier so I may carry premade panels to Argentina and back</p>
<p>$190 - Watercolor Stretcher so I can stretch and keep watercolors flat without warping. Usually I rely on my school's studio to flatten my watercolors, but I won't have access to their equipment in Argentina.</p>
<p>$20 - Palette Carrier so I can safely travel with my pallette and not have to waste any  expensive oil paint before I leave.</p>
<p>$100 - Money to buy panels and watercolor paper while I am in Argentina </p>
<p>$346 - Macro lens for a Pentax k-70 camera. This is so I can take high quality reference pictures of my muse (preserved animal specimens :D) and to also take high quality pictures of my work while I am down there. If I raise enough to also get this lens, contributors will be able to keep up with high quality progress pictures and of my life in Argentina! </p>
<p>If I raise more than the essentials and am able to purchase art supplies/etc. for my trip, I will post them here so you can see what your money is creating.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>My art will officially have global impact with scientific specimens from another country included in my art. For those who value the importance of the existence of artists (especially in Oklahoma) this is a great way to fund your local/country's art community.</li>
<li>Art I make will be professionally photographed and able to purchase as prints.</li>
<li>I will be able to meet my extended family and learn more about my heritage in Argentina, while also working on becoming bilingual. I look forward to having this experience that I can share with my grandmother, who was the one who inspired me to start painting as a little kid. She grew up in Buenos Aires, which is just a short drive away from where I will be staying. </li>
<li>The opportunity to have my own solo show as a recent college graduate is HUGE. I will be doing an artist talk and workshops there as well. Many galleries don't like artists unless they have shown at a substantial amount of places, but having my own solo show will greatly increase my success as an artist.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rent while I am gone. Since I most likely won't be able to have someone sublease where I live, I will still have to pay rent while I am not living in America. (However if you are looking for a place, feel free to message me!) I will be working on raising my own money to pay off rent and fees owed to the school for a class I am taking right now. I hope that whatever I am not able to make from my job I will make from selling my possessions. I will also be posting items I am selling on my own social media accounts.</li>
<li>Learning Spanish. I have always been exposed to the language from growing up with half of my family being bilingual and taking classes in high school, but I am not bilingual myself. I have been learning Spanish from Duolingo and I also hope to learn a bit more before leaving by attending conversation programs offered by my school's Spanish department. Regardless of how much I learn beforehand, I aim to become fully immersed in the culture and the language and learning the language of my heritage. </li>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Megan, I am an artist, performer, educator and human rights activist living in Canberra, Australia. Over the last 17 years I have helped a lot of people in the Canberra Community in my various roles.  Over the last 7 years I have had health problems, and at the beginning of 2018 I was diagnosed with an auto immune illness.  This illness is not curable. It may improve on its own, or it may get worse, and I have to learn to live with it.  I also lost my job in 2017 and because of this, and my illness, I haven't been able to work again.  Currently, my illness effects me in ways that mean most jobs would not suit my needs. I also turned 50 this year, my age adding to my disadvantage in the job market. My partners support me, however money is very tight and I am not entitled to any government benefits.  I have been completing a Certificate III in Micro Business Management, and learning what I need to do to start my own business. My aim is to have on online retail business selling items I have made. I am holding this campaign to raise business start up funds.  Money raised will help me launch my business in a manner which will be more likely to provide a sustainable, meaningful income.</p>
<h3>Where the funds will go</h3>
<p>Money raised will help me to hit the ground running with my business, rather than slowly adding parts to my business over time.  As I will be without a steady income during the startup period, the start up funds will help cover the costs of set up (see below), allowing me to achieve a strong professional impression for people visiting my business, and freeing me up to create a large number of items to list all at once, open with an established product base, encouraging customers to return, as well as spending time marketing products and building up connections.</p>
<p>I hope to raise $3000 through this campaign.  The cost of various aspects of the business are as follows:</p>
<p>Domain name (3 years)                                           $     50</p>
<p>Business name registration                                   $   200</p>
<p>Accountant  fees (advice and tax)                       $   400</p>
<p>Business stationery (cards, packaging)            $    150</p>
<p>e-commerce set up (Wix- 12 months)                $    372                         </p>
<p>Initial listing of items e-commerce (Etsy)         $      30</p>
<p>Marketing                                                                      $  500</p>
<p>Insurance                                                                      $  500</p>
<p>(part of home, public liability, car)</p>
<p>photography                                                                $   500</p>
<p>Equipment upgrade (printer etc)                         $   250 </p>
<p>total= $2952</p>
<p>The items are listed in order of importance. If I am not able to reach my goal, I will use the funds received on the items according to the order of the list.  Any amount received will be useful and alleviate the pressure of having very little money of my own to contribute. The marketing budget might be considered high, however marketing will be key to getting the business moving. It will be used to attract new customers and create ongoing connections, important to business success.</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>There will be a number of perks of different values which can be claimed.  The perks will all be hand made by me.  They will all relate to the theme of peacock spiders (including the Sparklemuffin spider), and peacock feathers and spiders.  This is all in connection with my branding. These perks are all limited and most will not be available after my campaign.  The perks are available to people living within Australia (and postage costs are included in the value of the perks and have been carefully considered). If you do not live in Australia but are interested in claiming a perk, this could be arranged, please contact me to discuss postage costs. NOTE: Perk items have been made in an environment with pets (cats and dog), so please consider if you have allergies.  The colours of the items may vary as compared to what is seen in the images, however colour combinations will remain the same (for example in the peacock feathers).  The due date of when items can be expected is the maximum time frame. I will endeavour to make the items as soon as possible and get them sent out, however it may depend on costs of materials etc.  I may not be able to make some items until the campaign is over.</p>
<h3>The impact</h3>
<p>Any money donated will have an impact on my personal quality of life and ability to get my business started.  I currently have a small amount of money each fortnight, which I can invest in my business, however, in doing so it means that I have less to cover costs such as medical appointments and other things that most people consider to be a part of daily living.   My business will give me an income, which at the moment is nonexistent. I also need to change my lifestyle, hopes and dreams fairly dramatically.  My illness has meant I had to stop doing many things that were important to me and gave my life meaning. This business is the beginning of these changes.</p>
<p>In the past, I have done a lot of voluntary work and helped other people, and now I find myself in the position where I need that help. However, I am community minded and I hope to continue to give back to the communities that have helped and supported me into the future.  Flossie's Kitten Rescue is a local cat rescue that works to find homes for unwanted cats. I plan to work with Flossie's, in that I will be making 'Cat Pods'.  Flossie's will help let people know about my cat pods, with a percentage of any sales made through Flossie's, being donated back to Flossie's.</p>
<p>I have a strong track record of successful projects and endeavours in my working and volunteer lives. Some of the things I have done as a volunteer include:  Implementing two art exhibitions for women subjected to sexual violence, which involved every stage of the process from mentoring and helping the women to make the art, through to hanging and opening the exhibitions; Running a course for same sex attracted women coming out or questioning their sexuality for 7 years; and producing three different variety shows to raise money, awareness and build community for gender diversity, LGBTIAQ communities, and mental illness.  These accomplishments have demonstrated my ability to plan and execute large projects successfully from start to completion, including organised all aspects of the shows, from finding the performers and supporting them, through to the marketing of the shows and performing in them.</p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The greatest risks and challenges to the success of my business, at the moment, is my health. However, I am very determined to make this all work and I believe I can through pacing myself and understanding how much and when I can achieve what, in regards to the various aspects of running my business. I have particularly chosen to start a business selling items I have made, because I do have to spend a lot of time resting, and while I am resting I am making things.  So this choice of business, at the moment, seems the most viable to me. I am someone who has been used to doing everything myself. However I have learnt in the course of 2018, that I can and do need to delegate tasks or ask for help at times.  This is something I can also do if I need help with my business.</p>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>Other ways you can help me is by spreading the word about my campaign. Directing people to my facebook artist page <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/MrGreenTeal/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/MrGreenTeal/</a> which will be one of the entry points (eventually) to my web page, once it has been developed.  You can request to go onto a mailing list, so I can keep you in the loop about my business as it develops.  You may have skills or tangible items you wish to donate to me to help me out.  I am open to discussion.</p>

<h2>Hello. My name is Fawne DeRosia.</h2>
<p>I am an artist living &amp; working in Thomaston, Georgia.</p>
<p><i>Full transcript of the video:</i><br/>I started this campaign to help with the purchase of my studio building. I’m currently renting &amp; have been for the past 8 years or so. I think that taking the next step &amp; investing in the community &amp; in this property is my best decision.</p>
<p><strong>But first here’s a little bit about me:</strong><br/>I like to try all kinds of art. I’ve painted a school bus, a large mural in the local fine arts center, another mural in the middle school. I’ve painted a flag on the side of a building. Last year I painted murals in Knoxville &amp; Memphis, Tennessee. I’m currently learning how to make awesome ceramic things. &amp; here’s a fun fact: I have the first Etsy shop ever.</p>
<p>Every year I gather a bunch of friends &amp; we make &amp; carry lanterns in the Christmas Light Parade. Last year I led the parade in a reindeer onesie. Check it out!</p>
<p>I am also a chalk artist. I’ve created chalk art in several states. Here’s me in Arkansas. Florida. Alabama. &amp; Minnesota.</p>
<p>Y’all, I really like making art. <i>I mean, really like it.</i></p>
<p><strong>Now let’s talk about the studio:</strong><br/>I started a storefront art studio back in 2012. A year later I moved that studio to a bigger space. Then I moved the studio again to the other side of the square. I changed the name to Flint Rose Studio, and celebrated finally having air conditioning by hosting my first Kids Art Camps &amp; a variety of classes and art shows.</p>
<p>Then I had to move the studio AGAIN. Every move presented its own set of challenges that we overcame somewhat gracefully. Sure, there were tears &amp; a lot of frustration &amp; thoughts of 'maybe I can’t do this anymore’, but you know what? We are still here. We are still kicking &amp; I hope to do so for many more years.</p>
<p>I’ve hosted classes to people of all ages. I often say that I really don't teach art, I just grant permission for your creativity. <strong>I feel that everyone has the ability to become an artist.</strong></p>
<p>My studio is 1600 square feet. Enough space for classes, a work area for myself, a gallery space, and lots of storage for art supplies. The space next door is 700 square feet. Ideally, I’d like to move all of the classroom activities next door so I won’t have to worry about accidents around my personal work.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s talk about Perks! </strong>You can give at any level that is good for you. Every bit of money will go towards the sale price of the building. Rewards include t shirts, &amp; mugs, &amp; stickers, &amp; postcards. A lot of cool things! Wow!</p>
<p>Please share this crowdfunding campaign with all of your friends and family and anyone that would like to help out a small town artist. Thank you! I appreciate you &amp; I will see you later. Bye!</p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>Let's break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>I set the goal at $25 000 to help me with a down payment on the property.</li>
<li>About $2500 will be set aside to help with creating &amp; shipping perks. Any unused portion of that will go towards the down payment. </li>
<li>If the entire goal isn't met, then I'll work harder to either reach it through art sales or classes. But I feel that any amount would help. </li>
</ul>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Flint Rose Studio has become a beacon of creativity in the community. Kids love coming in and painting whatever their hearts desire. Did you know that most elementary kids in Upson County don't have art classes in school? Flint Rose Studio hopes to fill that artistic need.</p>
<ul>
<li>Future plans include bringing in artists to teach workshops, creating community projects, &amp; coming up with outreach programs for all members of the community.</li>
<li>The new space next door can be used as rental space for birthdays and a variety of other parties. We can even start Open Mic night again!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Purchasing of a property will happen. I feel I have been renting a space for way too long &amp; need to commit to a permanent space in Thomaston. While I haven't made an official offer on the space yet, I'm close to doing so. If plans for purchasing the studio (or another property) falls through, all money raised through this campaign will be refunded.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worst case scenario, if I lose the space altogether, I do have a back up property in mind.</li>
<li>If you're unhappy with anything, let me know &amp; I can make refunds asap. However, if your reward has already shipped then our transactions are final. </li>

What We Need & What You Get
Let's break it down:

I set the goal at $25 000 to help me with a down payment on the property.
About $2500 will be set aside to help with creating & shipping perks. Any unused portion of that will go towards the down payment. 
If the entire goal isn't met, then I'll work harder to either reach it through art sales or classes. But I feel that any amount would help. 

The Impact
Flint Rose Studio has become a beacon of creativity in the community. Kids love coming in and painting whatever their hearts desire. Did you know that most elementary kids in Upson County don't have art classes in school? Flint Rose Studio hopes to fill that artistic need.

Future plans include bringing in artists to teach workshops, creating community projects, & coming up with outreach programs for all members of the community.
The new space next door can be used as rental space for birthdays and a variety of other parties. We can even start Open Mic night again!

Risks & Challenges
Purchasing of a property will happen. I feel I have been renting a space for way too long & need to commit to a permanent space in Thomaston. While I haven't made an official offer on the space yet, I'm close to doing so. If plans for purchasing the studio (or another property) falls through, all money raised through this campaign will be refunded.

Worst case scenario, if I lose the space altogether, I do have a back up property in mind.
If you're unhappy with anything, let me know & I can make refunds asap. However, if your reward has already shipped then our transactions are final.

WCS is excited to start opening to the public! </p><p>Supporting WCS is not only supporting a small business or incredible art community in Missoula but it is also supporting individual artists during critical and challenging times in their career! </p><p> </p><p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p><p><strong>UPDATE: Wildfire Ceramic Studio hosted a fundraising night at Highlander Brewing Co. and raised $2500.00 to fully fund our BIPOC Women in the Ceramic Arts Fellowship! This is such exciting news and we are more than grateful to be able to provide this opportunity! </strong></p><p>Minimum Goal $13,500.00</p><p>Money earned from this campaign will help cover initial start-up costs, studio enhancements, and support for artists at WCS! </p><p>First off, WCS is committed to stepping up and supporting underrepresented artists who need it most! To do this, WCS is creating the BIPOC Women in the Ceramic Arts Fellowship. This fellowship will fully fund one BIPOC identifying Woman a year, for a one-three month residency at Wildfire Ceramic Studio. This would assist in covering studio rent, materials, firings, and cost of living.</p><p>So here is the breakdown:</p><p>BIPOC Women in the Ceramic Arts Fellowship: $2,500.00</p><p>Gallery lighting and furniture: $800.00</p><p>Kilns: $4,600.00</p><p>Wiring, vents, etc: $1,000.00</p><p>Kiln furniture: $800.00</p><p>Glaze cart and start-up materials: $ 600.00</p><p>Sinks:  $200.00</p><p>Studio setup: $2,200.00</p><p>Slab roller: $800.00</p><p><strong>What if we do not reach our goal of $13,500.00?</strong></p><p>Any amount raised will help! WCS is passionate about the BIPOC Women in the Ceramic Arts Fellowship and 30% of funds will be allocated to the fellowship. The rest of the funding will be used to enhance and improve the studio and gallery to make the best working environment possible for the artists at Wildfire Ceramic Studio! </p><p><strong>What if we exceed $13,500.00?!</strong></p><p>The yearly cost for an artist to have a space at WCS is $3,000.00. This does not cover materials, firing fees, or outside living costs that require many emerging artists to have part or full-time employment. This takes precious time away from their studio practice. WCS would love to raise an additional $7,500.00 to help financially support the artists at WCS. This would bring the monthly studio cost for each artist down to $125.00 a month allowing more time in the studio for each artist! </p><p>WCS also plans on selling ceramic tools, underglazes, and clay to the public within the next year. Any extra funding will help to expedite this exciting endeavor! </p><p><strong>What if you cannot donate?</strong></p><p>Help us spread the word! Share this campaign with any and everyone! Not only can this help us meet our funding goal but it will also spread the word about our incredible studio and gallery to help us grow in other ways! So please do not be shy, use those Indiegogo share tools!</p><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><p>Along with the different merch available for this campaign we have an assortment of donated artwork that will be raffled off at the end of this campaign! Purchasing raffle tickets will go into a general raffle draw for the pieces.</p><p><i>When you purchase raffle tickets they will not go in for a specific piece. </i></p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","Mission Statement:Wildfire Ceramic Studio (WCS) is a new and exciting ceramic studio and gallery in the heart of Missoula Montana!

WCS is excited to start opening to the public! Supporting WCS is not only supporting a small business or incredible art community in Missoula but it is also supporting individual artists during critical and challenging times in their career!  Where will the money go?UPDATE: Wildfire Ceramic Studio hosted a fundraising night at Highlander Brewing Co. and raised $2500.00 to fully fund our BIPOC Women in the Ceramic Arts Fellowship! This is such exciting news and we are more than grateful to be able to provide this opportunity! Minimum Goal $13,500.00Money earned from this campaign will help cover initial start-up costs, studio enhancements, and support for artists at WCS! First off, WCS is committed to stepping up and supporting underrepresented artists who need it most! To do this, WCS is creating the BIPOC Women in the Ceramic Arts Fellowship. This fellowship will fully fund one BIPOC identifying Woman a year, for a one-three month residency at Wildfire Ceramic Studio. This would assist in covering studio rent, materials, firings, and cost of living.So here is the breakdown:BIPOC Women in the Ceramic Arts Fellowship: $2,500.00Gallery lighting and furniture: $800.00Kilns: $4,600.00Wiring, vents, etc: $1,000.00Kiln furniture: $800.00Glaze cart and start-up materials: $ 600.00Sinks:  $200.00Studio setup: $2,200.00Slab roller: $800.00What if we do not reach our goal of $13,500.00?Any amount raised will help! WCS is passionate about the BIPOC Women in the Ceramic Arts Fellowship and 30% of funds will be allocated to the fellowship. The rest of the funding will be used to enhance and improve the studio and gallery to make the best working environment possible for the artists at Wildfire Ceramic Studio! What if we exceed $13,500.00?!The yearly cost for an artist to have a space at WCS is $3,000.00. This does not cover materials, firing fees, or outside living costs that require many emerging artists to have part or full-time employment. This takes precious time away from their studio practice. WCS would love to raise an additional $7,500.00 to help financially support the artists at WCS. This would bring the monthly studio cost for each artist down to $125.00 a month allowing more time in the studio for each artist! WCS also plans on selling ceramic tools, underglazes, and clay to the public within the next year. Any extra funding will help to expedite this exciting endeavor! What if you cannot donate?Help us spread the word! Share this campaign with any and everyone! Not only can this help us meet our funding goal but it will also spread the word about our incredible studio and gallery to help us grow in other ways! So please do not be shy, use those Indiegogo share tools!PerksAlong with the different merch available for this campaign we have an assortment of donated artwork that will be raffled off at the end of this campaign! Purchasing raffle tickets will go into a general raffle draw for the pieces.When you purchase raffle tickets they will not go in for a specific piece.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For the past fourteen months creative outputs have been inextricably bound to our collective state of confinement. Artists have been forced to reconfigure their practices without ease of access to studios and gallery spaces. What was once been a myriad pool of opportunity and inspiration has been closed off. Lockdown shrunk our perspectives down to fit the parameters of our homes, but the escapist powers of imagination and creativity allowed for those boundaries to be widened.</p>
<p>Across the River will showcase six young artists who continued to make art in drastically altered circumstances from those which they were familiar. It will show how these selected artists responded to a situation defined by isolation, one we all experienced in both similar and fundamentally different ways. The pieces will present vibrant, other-worldly paintings which have been born from this period of collective myopia, from the shrinking of perspective.</p>
<p>The exhibition will be hosted in a new exhibition space in West London which doubles as the garden flat home of its owners. By transforming from a domestic living space to an exhibition gallery, what was once a place of isolation and refuge transposes into a place of communication, connection and bustle.</p>

<h3>CONTEMPORARY ARABIC SCRIPT ANIMATIONS</h3>
<p>Throughout my extensive experience as a motion designer and my background in broadcast design in the Middle East region for the last 17 years, I have come to realize that many challenges are faced trying to animate Arabic script because of its cursive nature and its letters that change form depending on their position within a word. Most of the existing animation tools are designed to be used exclusively with Latin scripts. Utilizing them with Arabic script results in broken Arabic letter-forms and hence aesthetically poor and grammatically incorrect animations.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>ARABTATION</h3>
<p>Arabtation is a proposed plugin dedicated to animators (freelancers as well as employed) in the fields of broadcast, advertising and film and that allows the creation of more sophisticated, creative and elaborate Arabic script animations while respecting the grammatical rules of the Arabic letter-forms. All the Arabic letter-forms within the plugin are built using the spiral unit system devised based on the motion study of the whirling dervish dance. This gave the letter-forms the flexibility needed to animate, to morph into their different instances within a word and to connect to each other to form words. The initial form of the spiral unit can be easily changed and manipulated according to a series of parameters controlled by sliders. The modifications applied will affect the design of the letter-forms. The plugin is highly customizable and allows the creation of a wide range of animations by playing around with the spiral units, the letters and the words.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This plugin offers a first of a kind solution that boosts the quality of the Arabic script animations, granting them a modern and contemporary edge.

<h3>FUNDING AND ROADMAP</h3>
<p><strong>Funding needed: CHF 30,000.-</strong></p>
<p>I have reached a phase now where I need to create the plugin with the help and technical capabilities of a developer over the course of the coming 3 months.

<p>Raising this amount will also give me a psychological boost to carry on working on the plugin with many future steps ahead:<br/>- create several versions of the plugin linked to other dance disciplines and body movement<br/>- link the plugin to performances/projections where the Arabic typography will be controlled by live dance or music<br/>- organize workshops to raise awareness about the plugin and about the Arabic script animation in general </p>

<p><strong>In questi ultimi anni l’animazione stop-motion si è imposta come scelta tecnica per raccontare storie per il cinema e oggi si vedono in sala sempre più film realizzati fotogramma dopo fotogramma.

<p><strong> E in italia? In Italia ancora non si sono visti film di lungometraggio realizzati in stop-motion, ma possiamo affermare che vari progetti sono in cantiere e ci auguriamo che possano a breve trovare la giusta strada produttiva. Si fa intanto molto lavoro di ricerca, si realizzano cortometraggi, l’animazione a passo uno è insegnata nelle scuole, come ad esempio allo IED Roma (<a href=""https://www.ied.it/roma/scuola-arti-visive/corsi-specializzazione/animazione%E2%80%93stop-motion/CRAVBNI001_01"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ied.it/roma/scuola-arti-visive/cors...</a> ) e bisogna assolutamente segnalare una novità tecnica tutta italiana: la produzione di un’armatura per burattini interamente sviluppata e realizzata nel nostro paese. L’elemento più importante per il burattino da stop-motion è proprio lo scheletro, detto anche armatura. Un burattino con uno scheletro non ben realizzato risulterà di difficile gestione durante l’animazione, se non addirittura impossibile. Sapere che anche in Italia qualcuno ha deciso di dedicarsi alla fabbricazione di armature per stop-motion è sintomo certo dell’inizio di una bella avventura. Il nome di questo piccolo gioiello tecnico è GEORGE® ed è stata sviluppata e prodotta da stopmotionengineeringstore.com  </strong></p>
<p><i>-And in Italy? In Italy there are still no feature films made in stop-motion, but we can say that various projects are in the pipeline and we hope that they will soon find the right production path. In the meantime, a lot of research work is being done, short films are produced, the animation at step one is taught in schools, such as at IED Rome (<a href=""https://www.ied.it/roma/scuola-arti-visive/corsi-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ied.it/roma/scuola-arti-visive/corsi-</a> specialization / animation-stop-motion / CRAVBNI001_01) and it is absolutely necessary to point out an all-Italian technical innovation: the production of a puppet armature entirely developed and realized in our country. The most important element for the stop-motion puppet is the skeleton, also called the armor. A puppet with a skeleton is not well realized will be difficult to manage during the animation, if not impossible. Knowing that even in Italy someone decided to devote himself to the manufacture of armor for stop-motion is a sure sign of the beginning of a good adventure. The name of this little technical jewel is GEORGE® and has been developed and produced by stopmotionengineeringstore.com-</i></p>

<p><strong>Uno scheletro per burattino da stop-motion deve essere robusto, ma al tempo stesso estremamente leggero, stabile e di facile mobilità. Deve muoversi agilmente, mantenendo la posizione senza subire modificazioni dovute ad assestamenti o cedimenti e non deve perdere questa caratteristica dopo pochi movimenti a causa dell’allentarsi di viti o snodi. Il giusto movimento dello scheletro permette al burattino di non assumere posizioni che potrebbero apparire innaturali e fa sì che non si creino rotture o deformazioni nei materiali di rivestimento. In tutto questo GEORGE® risponde perfettamente alle aspettative.  </strong></p>
<p>-<i>A stop-motion puppet skeleton must be robust, but at the same time extremely light, stable and easy to move. It must move easily, maintaining the position without undergoing changes due to settlements or subsidence and must not lose this feature after a few movements due to the loosening of screws or joints. The right movement of the skeleton allows the puppet not to assume positions that may appear unnatural and causes no cracks or deformations in the coating materials to be created. In all this GEORGE® perfectly meets expectations.-  </i></p>

<p><strong>Grande attenzione è stata posta anche sull’utilizzo di soluzioni innovative per l’uso più largo dell’armatura. Di particolare nota è il sistema di fissaggio rapido utilizzato per gli arti e il collo, che permette di creare diverse mani, piedi e teste, pur mantenendo lo stesso corpo. L’arto viene rimosso con estrema facilità e sostituito con un altro. L’attacco rapido è realizzato mediante lavorazione CNC in acciaio inox. Il torso superiore è realizzato completamente in carbonio  in tre diverse versioni: una base, una sezione rinforzata migliorata per giunti di spalla e un altro con un collo dinamica speciale.  </strong></p>
<p><i>-Great attention has also been paid to the use of innovative solutions for the wider use of the reinforcement. Of particular note is the fastening system used for the limbs and the neck, which allows you to create different hands, feet and heads, while maintaining the same body.

The upper torso is made entirely of carbon and was created in three different versions: a base, an improved reinforced section for shoulder joints and another with a special dynamic neck.-</i></p>

<p><i><strong>The first studies to create a highly innovative professional product were undertaken in early 2015. The decision was immediately taken to use a material that had never been adopted in the animation sector: CARBON FIBRE.   The products and armatures (the supporting skeleton of the puppets used for the creation of videos) currently on the market are all in metal, carbon or stainless steel.  These are quite light but rather unreliable and may deform when subject to stress. In contrast, carbon fibre is extremely light, yet rigid and will not deform.  The project was developed in various phases. First, a long period of meticulous solid modelling generated the first version of the armature. It featured: - limb stems made 100% from carbon rod - joint plates from carbon sheet cut and worked with CNC machining centre - hip block and other large parts from thick carbon sheet cut and worked with CNC machining centre - spherical joints in perforated and rectified stainless steel. The carbon sheets are cut and worked by tool machinery, controlled by CNC to guarantee the highest level of precision and cutting quality. The carbon rods are rounded and 3mm in diameter.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>As a result, GEORGE® has become a versatile, precisely calibrated professional tool for artists and animators to create their own images.</strong></i></p>
</div></div>","GEORGE® ARMATURE INTERVIEW



Like all GEORGE®ARMATURES products, our new armatures are packed full of features and meticulously engineered. These are designed from the ground up to be both the best animation armatures and the best figure for the animators, students and artists in the world.





In questi ultimi anni l’animazione stop-motion si è imposta come scelta tecnica per raccontare storie per il cinema e oggi si vedono in sala sempre più film realizzati fotogramma dopo fotogramma. Nella scorsa edizione degli oscar c’erano tra le candidature ben due film realizzati in stop-motion, La mia vita da zucchina e Kubo e la spada magica e nelle prossime settimane usciranno I Primitivi, del colosso storico Aardman Studios e il nuovo gioiellino d’autore, fuori da qualsiasi schema, di Wes Anderson.  
-In recent years, stop-motion animation has become a technical choice to tell stories for the cinema and today we see more and more films made in the room frame by frame. In the last edition of the Oscar there were among the nominations two films made in stop-motion, My life from zucchini and Kubo and the magic sword and in the coming weeks the Primitives will be released by the historical giant Aardman Studios And the new designer gem, out of any scheme, by Wes Anderson.


 E in italia? In Italia ancora non si sono visti film di lungometraggio realizzati in stop-motion, ma possiamo affermare che vari progetti sono in cantiere e ci auguriamo che possano a breve trovare la giusta strada produttiva. Si fa intanto molto lavoro di ricerca, si realizzano cortometraggi, l’animazione a passo uno è insegnata nelle scuole, come ad esempio allo IED Roma (https://www.ied.it/roma/scuola-arti-visive/cors... ) e bisogna assolutamente segnalare una novità tecnica tutta italiana: la produzione di un’armatura per burattini interamente sviluppata e realizzata nel nostro paese. L’elemento più importante per il burattino da stop-motion è proprio lo scheletro, detto anche armatura. Un burattino con uno scheletro non ben realizzato risulterà di difficile gestione durante l’animazione, se non addirittura impossibile. Sapere che anche in Italia qualcuno ha deciso di dedicarsi alla fabbricazione di armature per stop-motion è sintomo certo dell’inizio di una bella avventura. Il nome di questo piccolo gioiello tecnico è GEORGE® ed è stata sviluppata e prodotta da stopmotionengineeringstore.com  
-And in Italy? In Italy there are still no feature films made in stop-motion, but we can say that various projects are in the pipeline and we hope that they will soon find the right production path. In the meantime, a lot of research work is being done, short films are produced, the animation at step one is taught in schools, such as at IED Rome (https://www.ied.it/roma/scuola-arti-visive/corsi- specialization / animation-stop-motion / CRAVBNI001_01) and it is absolutely necessary to point out an all-Italian technical innovation: the production of a puppet armature entirely developed and realized in our country. The most important element for the stop-motion puppet is the skeleton, also called the armor. A puppet with a skeleton is not well realized will be difficult to manage during the animation, if not impossible. Knowing that even in Italy someone decided to devote himself to the manufacture of armor for stop-motion is a sure sign of the beginning of a good adventure. The name of this little technical jewel is GEORGE® and has been developed and produced by stopmotionengineeringstore.com-




Uno scheletro per burattino da stop-motion deve essere robusto, ma al tempo stesso estremamente leggero, stabile e di facile mobilità. Deve muoversi agilmente, mantenendo la posizione senza subire modificazioni dovute ad assestamenti o cedimenti e non deve perdere questa caratteristica dopo pochi movimenti a causa dell’allentarsi di viti o snodi. Il giusto movimento dello scheletro permette al burattino di non assumere posizioni che potrebbero apparire innaturali e fa sì che non si creino rotture o deformazioni nei materiali di rivestimento. In tutto questo GEORGE® risponde perfettamente alle aspettative.  
-A stop-motion puppet skeleton must be robust, but at the same time extremely light, stable and easy to move. It must move easily, maintaining the position without undergoing changes due to settlements or subsidence and must not lose this feature after a few movements due to the loosening of screws or joints. The right movement of the skeleton allows the puppet not to assume positions that may appear unnatural and causes no cracks or deformations in the coating materials to be created. In all this GEORGE® perfectly meets expectations.-  

L’armatura GEORGE® durante i test al corso di specializzazione in stop-motion dello IED Roma  
-The GEORGE® armature during the tests at the stop-motion specialization course of the IED Rome-
Grande attenzione è stata posta anche sull’utilizzo di soluzioni innovative per l’uso più largo dell’armatura. Di particolare nota è il sistema di fissaggio rapido utilizzato per gli arti e il collo, che permette di creare diverse mani, piedi e teste, pur mantenendo lo stesso corpo. L’arto viene rimosso con estrema facilità e sostituito con un altro. L’attacco rapido è realizzato mediante lavorazione CNC in acciaio inox. Il torso superiore è realizzato completamente in carbonio  in tre diverse versioni: una base, una sezione rinforzata migliorata per giunti di spalla e un altro con un collo dinamica speciale.  
-Great attention has also been paid to the use of innovative solutions for the wider use of the reinforcement. Of particular note is the fastening system used for the limbs and the neck, which allows you to create different hands, feet and heads, while maintaining the same body. The limb is easily removed and replaced with another. The quick coupling is made by CNC machining in stainless steel. The upper torso is made entirely of carbon and was created in three different versions: a base, an improved reinforced section for shoulder joints and another with a special dynamic neck.-

<h3>We can't promise that there will be another Strange Folk Festival after this.

</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Festival founder, Autumn Wiggins, summarizes and reflects:</p>
<p>""After years of grappling with Strange Folk's former venue and payment processor over allocated funds, I ended the festival indefinitely in O'Fallon, IL at a meeting with the parks department mid-January 2015. Soon after, the city engaged in some odd behavior. They sent legal notices demanding Facebook and website passwords, asked the police to confiscate my laptop, and crudely edited a 2014 web graphic of the festival illustration to say '2015.' They emailed that image to a list of vendors that they had processed payments for over the years. It told them to 'Save the Date,' with no mention that I wasn't involved. </p>
<p>My vendors caught on right away. #NoFakeFolk begat <a href=""http://strangefolkfestival.tumblr.com/post/117745938233/glittergate-a-statement-from-strange-folk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Glittergate</a> and the widely publicized battle for Strange Folk's intellectual property that I clearly won without ever stepping foot in a courtroom. </p>
<div>During this time, vendors and fans encouraged me not to give up, and to move the festival somewhere new. I decided to see if any place really inspired me, and I remember my trips to Union Station as a child fondly. </div>
<div>
<br/>That is was even a possibility...to create a mall full of makers! I dove in, and made sure Strange Folk's guaranteed revenue sources would more than cover it's total annual expenses. Expenses that have never included the mass-customization machines and tools I have been dreaming of using to produce installation pieces, upcycled graphic elements, hands-on project components and much more. Nor have those expenses ever included anything but a scant salary for myself for a decade. That just can't continue. </div>
<div>
<br/><p>I'm not going to gouge vendors or impose lines and ticket scanners on our guests that have been able to come and go as they please all these years.</p>
<div>My store, <a href=""http://upxchange.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Upcycle Exchange</a>, has operated as pay-as-you-wish retail for 5 years. This concept can be a bellwether for what a community values, and I have experienced a remarkable amount of common ground and generosity through it. </div>
<div>By initially ending Strange Folk, I had hoped to focus on Upcycle. Under updated circumstances, I decided on the opposite approach. <br/>I've scaled back my shop momentarily and moved to a private headquarters so I can work non-stop on Strange Folk 2015. <p></p>
<div>If this campaign is successful, Strange Folk will not end at Union Station. I'd love to take it back to a park after this and to keep producing it in the authentic manner that I always have. I refuse to compromise the integrity of what I've created. </div>
<div>No matter what, I will continue to pursue exciting creative projects that benefit the St. Louis region and the maker community at large, and am endlessly grateful to contributors and supporters of the spirit of Strange Folk. You enable pioneering retail platforms and modes of fabrication. This isn't just a craft show. ""</div>

</div></div>","Makers are taking over Union Station.  

Strange Folk Festival is switching up it's venue to a beautiful and unique, yet sparsely occupied, mall in downtown St. Louis, MO over the weekend of September 26th -27th, 2015. We have chosen 200 indie entrepreneurs who will occupy nearly every empty retail store on the 1st and 2nd levels. 



Bands will be playing out to the audience both inside and out from the old Hooters on the 3rd floor. We promise that it will be kid friendly, but might ask all the bands wear bright orange bloomers, just for giggles. 


Visitors can treat themselves to 25 food trucks/concessions, adult beverages + a singing fudge shop and Subway. We're all in this mall together, after all.  You'll experience unique atmospheric installations and exhibits. The Hunt for Craft October is our craft supply scavenger hunt and Fort Featherbottom, our handmade children's playground, will be re-imagined. Many unique and simple hands-on activities will be free to make too!


We promise that admission to Strange Folk Festival will always be FREE.



We can't promise that there will be another Strange Folk Festival after this.

<p>Art In The Yard is my annual labor of love.  Art In The Yard 7 will be held  on August 8th from 4:17p-9p at Art Produce Garden (3139 University Ave., SD, Ca 92104).  It is an urban art experience that originated as a way to showcase my art.  I use to hold in my front yard.  It has grown every year.  A couple of years ago we moved the event to the Art Produce Garden.  Since then our turnout has continue to grow and grow.  Last year we had over 300 people attend!!  Now it is a way to bring recognition and visibility to artists and vendors (especially in our community) that might not show or sell anywhere else.  I want to help foster other creativity and talent and really celebrate the arts.</p>
<p>In years past I have paid for the event out of my own pocket.  This year, as I am trying to grow this event, I am adding other features.  I'm so pleased to officially announce the artists, vendors, and performers that are participating in Art In The Yard 7. <br/><br/><b>Artists:</b></p>

<p>The larger and more successful the event is the more it costs.  That's where all of you come in!! Your contribution will help all involved be able to show their skill and talent at another level and provide a culture rich atmosphere for the community.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>Okay kind folks were trying to raise $4500.  This money is to pay for the venue (use of it and insurance), the advertising (fliers, posters, print media, online media, etc), art supplies (canvas, hanging material, paint, wood), other supplies (lights, sound equipment, easel rentals, food &amp; drink ingredients, food services supplies, etc).</p>
<p>There are lots of perks ranging from accessories, to custom artwork, to a gourmet dinner by and with one of the artists.  </p>
<p>If for some reason we don't raise the entire amount all the money raised will still go towards covering the costs of the aforementioned necessities.</p>
<p>All perks are to be claimed at the actual Art In The Yard 7 event.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Art In The Yard was created to help folks get ""out"" there.  I started this event originally because I was painting but didn't know how or where to show my work. Most galleries want commission and a reputation and you have to know people to get into art shows typically.  A friend of mine suggested that I hold my own event to showcase my art.  So I did!!  I started realizing a lot of artists and other very creative people felt the same way so I invited them to show their work and sell their wares.  </p>
<p>It has grown every year.  The first year we had 30 people and as I stated before, last year we had over 300!!  Art In The Yard is allowing unknown talents to show their work, feel a sense of accomplishment.  Can you imagine being an independent or underground artist or vendor that has never shown anywhere and then showing and selling at a well attended show?  It completely changes the way one thinks about themselves and their craft.  It's an AMAZING feeling!!  I have seen unknown artists that have participated in this event go on to be well respected in the art community and show their work all over, regularly.  That has been the real mission of this event.  I just hope to see it more often.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest obstacles we face this year are time and space.  This year the I have been happily inundated with requests to be involved in/with the show.  While that is great the space in which we hold the event is finite and currently evolving which has the potential to limit how many people can participate.  If were, able to raise enough money in time we may be able to expand the event into the adjoining the alley.This would allow us to add more vendors and artists.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
</div><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><ul>
<li>Help get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!!</li>
<li>Come to the actual event on August 9th!!  Bring people with you too!!  It starts at 4:17p (yes, 4:17p I'm random LOL!!) and ends at 9p.  It will be held at Art Produce Garden at 3139 University Ave., SD, Ca 92104</li>
</ul><p></p><p>And that's all there is to it.  Thank you all in advance for you support.  It's truly appreciated.</p><p></p></div>","Short Summary

The larger and more successful the event is the more it costs.  That's where all of you come in!! Your contribution will help all involved be able to show their skill and talent at another level and provide a culture rich atmosphere for the community.


   What We Need & What You Get 
Okay kind folks were trying to raise $4500.  This money is to pay for the venue (use of it and insurance), the advertising (fliers, posters, print media, online media, etc), art supplies (canvas, hanging material, paint, wood), other supplies (lights, sound equipment, easel rentals, food & drink ingredients, food services supplies, etc).
There are lots of perks ranging from accessories, to custom artwork, to a gourmet dinner by and with one of the artists.  
If for some reason we don't raise the entire amount all the money raised will still go towards covering the costs of the aforementioned necessities.
All perks are to be claimed at the actual Art In The Yard 7 event.   The Impact 
Art In The Yard was created to help folks get ""out"" there.  I started this event originally because I was painting but didn't know how or where to show my work. Most galleries want commission and a reputation and you have to know people to get into art shows typically.  A friend of mine suggested that I hold my own event to showcase my art.  So I did!!  I started realizing a lot of artists and other very creative people felt the same way so I invited them to show their work and sell their wares.  
It has grown every year.  The first year we had 30 people and as I stated before, last year we had over 300!!  Art In The Yard is allowing unknown talents to show their work, feel a sense of accomplishment.  Can you imagine being an independent or underground artist or vendor that has never shown anywhere and then showing and selling at a well attended show?  It completely changes the way one thinks about themselves and their craft.  It's an AMAZING feeling!!  I have seen unknown artists that have participated in this event go on to be well respected in the art community and show their work all over, regularly.  That has been the real mission of this event.  I just hope to see it more often.   Risks & Challenges The biggest obstacles we face this year are time and space.  This year the I have been happily inundated with requests to be involved in/with the show.  While that is great the space in which we hold the event is finite and currently evolving which has the potential to limit how many people can participate.  If were, able to raise enough money in time we may be able to expand the event into the adjoining the alley.This would allow us to add more vendors and artists.
    
Other Ways You Can Help
Help get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.
Use the Indiegogo share tools!!
Come to the actual event on August 9th!!  Bring people with you too!!  It starts at 4:17p (yes, 4:17p I'm random LOL!!) and ends at 9p.  It will be held at Art Produce Garden at 3139 University Ave., SD, Ca 92104
And that's all there is to it.  Thank you all in advance for you support.  It's truly appreciated.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

And, help raise that last 23% percentage of the goal to fulfill my project!   I've been dreaming of making this idea a reality for a while now and I'm so excited to finally jump in! For nine years I've been focusing on commissions and teaching to support myself, family and business while working at becoming a better painter. I feel blessed to be able to be an artist and I've just learned so much over the years through working on commissions and teaching- that it's been the most enjoyable time of my life.  With that being said, I also feel I haven't had the invaluable time needed to be able to focus fully on evolving my own visions/feelings in my work and I'm ready now more than ever.  I’ve invested in myself, applied to grants and I'm always looking for opportunities that may help me achieve this goal-they have lead me here.  So, I'm ready to let go of the reins and stop looking at other art, quiet the voices of the outside world and truly tap into my own.  This break from these distractions will allow me the opportunity to build a powerful body of work that I can pour myself into fully, heart and soul.  Work that I can carry into the future, pursuing gallery representation, having solo exhibitions and other opportunities that will open many more doors to explore.  </p><p>The Funds &amp; Perks</p><p>I’ll need 9,000 to cover and complete this project. </p><p>To create the new paintings there are some supplies I will need.  They have come out to $4650.  They are as follows: Paint, Substrates, stretcher bars, studio and application tools, brushes, updated lighting, mediums, varnish and frames.</p><p>Other Expenses have come out to $4350: Studio/gallery yearly rent (I've had a public gallery space at LibertyTown Arts in Fredericksburg Va since 2009 that I LOVE and cannot afford to stay, and am trying to keep it for another year-as it's been very helpful exposure), Living expenses, New Website yearly fee, shipping costs of my work to different galleries in the USA, and Perk fulfillment. </p><p>Here is the link to LibertyTown Arts!: <a href=""http://www.libertytownarts.com/site/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.libertytownarts.com/site/</a></p><p>And, here is me in my studio/gallery space through out the years there!: </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438559471/auc5iuucsvsu6one14vp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438559571/vraadbti0dl5zwtnwa6j.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438559626/hxsm3venvz6dmlogkcid.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>So...Perks! The fun part! </p><p>I'm so excited about sharing these with you. I'm offering original charcoal drawings and oil paintings for lower prices, email critiques, wildcards, VIP invitations to see the Solo Show work first, art discounts and other surprises.   I'm also putting together some rad handwritten thank you cards because I appreciate you all so much.  </p><p>Below are photos of the pieces you are purchasing when you make a donation. They are listed in order to match up with the perks on the main page.  For more details or questions, feel free to message me here: jennaanderson2016@gmail.com  (Scroll down to the bottom of the story to view the images)</p><h3>The Impact</h3><div>               This campaign is just the beginning of the path I wish to be on, moving forward towards my goals.  My overall goal as a painter is to paint what I love.  And, I've been working hard for nine years now during which I've been eagerly gathering the reference material for these ""love"" paintings, and they've been patiently waiting for me to bring them to life.  I think..Honestly,their patience is running low... but that's a whole other story.  But, my point being, I've wanted nothing more in my life than the chance to paint them and it's Time.  At the end of this journey of a year I will hold a Solo Exhibition, unveiling this new library of paintings all together as a series.  The difference you will be making in my life will be more profound than I can possibly express, both mentally and spiritually.   With your help I can grow and evolve as an artist, building upon the foundation I’ve started- towards something even more amazing and authentically me.  And, I'll be able to keep my studio/gallery space that I love at LibertyTown Arts which will help me even further and keep me going strong on my journey! Now is your opportunity to give a little bit that will help me for a lifetime.  <p>I hope to share with you this new work and new energy it brings out.  I’ve never had a campaign or done anything like this, but I don't give up and would love the chance to prove myself to you.  Because, I’m obsessed with creating art, with painting and if I don’t get this chance I may go a little crazy.  And, I'm looking forward to sharing this journey with you as I keep you updated on my progress throughout the year. </p>

And, help raise that last 23% percentage of the goal to fulfill my project!   I've been dreaming of making this idea a reality for a while now and I'm so excited to finally jump in! For nine years I've been focusing on commissions and teaching to support myself, family and business while working at becoming a better painter. I feel blessed to be able to be an artist and I've just learned so much over the years through working on commissions and teaching- that it's been the most enjoyable time of my life.  With that being said, I also feel I haven't had the invaluable time needed to be able to focus fully on evolving my own visions/feelings in my work and I'm ready now more than ever.  I’ve invested in myself, applied to grants and I'm always looking for opportunities that may help me achieve this goal-they have lead me here.  So, I'm ready to let go of the reins and stop looking at other art, quiet the voices of the outside world and truly tap into my own.  This break from these distractions will allow me the opportunity to build a powerful body of work that I can pour myself into fully, heart and soul.  Work that I can carry into the future, pursuing gallery representation, having solo exhibitions and other opportunities that will open many more doors to explore.  The Funds & PerksI’ll need 9,000 to cover and complete this project. To create the new paintings there are some supplies I will need.  They have come out to $4650.  They are as follows: Paint, Substrates, stretcher bars, studio and application tools, brushes, updated lighting, mediums, varnish and frames.Other Expenses have come out to $4350: Studio/gallery yearly rent (I've had a public gallery space at LibertyTown Arts in Fredericksburg Va since 2009 that I LOVE and cannot afford to stay, and am trying to keep it for another year-as it's been very helpful exposure), Living expenses, New Website yearly fee, shipping costs of my work to different galleries in the USA, and Perk fulfillment. Here is the link to LibertyTown Arts!: http://www.libertytownarts.com/site/And, here is me in my studio/gallery space through out the years there!: So...Perks! The fun part! I'm so excited about sharing these with you. I'm offering original charcoal drawings and oil paintings for lower prices, email critiques, wildcards, VIP invitations to see the Solo Show work first, art discounts and other surprises.   I'm also putting together some rad handwritten thank you cards because I appreciate you all so much.  Below are photos of the pieces you are purchasing when you make a donation. They are listed in order to match up with the perks on the main page.  For more details or questions, feel free to message me here: jennaanderson2016@gmail.com  (Scroll down to the bottom of the story to view the images)The Impact               This campaign is just the beginning of the path I wish to be on, moving forward towards my goals.  My overall goal as a painter is to paint what I love.  And, I've been working hard for nine years now during which I've been eagerly gathering the reference material for these ""love"" paintings, and they've been patiently waiting for me to bring them to life.  I think..Honestly,their patience is running low... but that's a whole other story.  But, my point being, I've wanted nothing more in my life than the chance to paint them and it's Time.  At the end of this journey of a year I will hold a Solo Exhibition, unveiling this new library of paintings all together as a series.  The difference you will be making in my life will be more profound than I can possibly express, both mentally and spiritually.   With your help I can grow and evolve as an artist, building upon the foundation I’ve started- towards something even more amazing and authentically me.  And, I'll be able to keep my studio/gallery space that I love at LibertyTown Arts which will help me even further and keep me going strong on my journey! Now is your opportunity to give a little bit that will help me for a lifetime.  I hope to share with you this new work and new energy it brings out.  I’ve never had a campaign or done anything like this, but I don't give up and would love the chance to prove myself to you.  Because, I’m obsessed with creating art, with painting and if I don’t get this chance I may go a little crazy.  And, I'm looking forward to sharing this journey with you as I keep you updated on my progress throughout the year.

Progression of Wildflower Study, oil on panel. For this piece I explored a starting method I felt suited my subject most. I went from the parts to the whole. Selecting a small part of my subject, finishing it, selecting the adjoining part, finishing that and so on until all is whole. This approach allows you to explore all the elements in the subject at once, having fun with the subsequent stages of the painting.

<br/></span>Firstly, we think it is important to let people know what is happening in Japan. Not only with Rokudenshiko, but also those LGBT artists in Japan who have been warned or arrested under the Obscenity Laws in the past three years. People in Hong Kong are aware of freedom of artistic expression and we believe that it is significant to realize this project in Hong Kong, a hub in Asia and also a location that is highly aware of, even threatened by, authoritarian politics. </div><div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Secondly, relating to Rokudenashiko's incident, we will try to examine feminism in art and digital obscenity in this exhibition, within the context of the Hong Kong and Japanese experience. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Through the works of art in this exhibition, and information provided about the Rokudenashiko case, we will be rethinking issues around feminism and genitalia in a cultural and political context. </span>

<h3>Background:</h3>
<br/><p>
</p>
<p>July 2014 in Tokyo, the artist Megumi Igarashi (also known as Rokudenashiko) has been arrested for distributing her vagina 3D data onto an internet crowdfunding site. This is believed to be in violation of the Japanese Obscenity Laws. She was released after a few days, then arrested again in December 2014. This time she was in police custody for the maximum duration in this type of case, 23 days.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434041177/o1wtiahfxy0bgdspgd2n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The male genitals can be seen sometimes at traditional Japanese festivals, the ‘secret treasure’ museums and in some contemporary art works. Rokudenashiko believes that the vagina is overly hidden compared to the penis. She started working on this theme because she wants to liberate women from thinking of their vaginas as a dirty image. Her intention is to liberate women to become more open and uninhabited over their vaginas, and thus, equalize males and females. Her trial started in April 2015. She and a group of attorneys denied obscenity charges and argued censorship of artistic expression and Japan’s double standards. Pornographic cartoons are numerous in Japan, why were her works of arts selected for punishment?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In March 2015, there was a symposium organized by The Coming Society in Hong Kong. There was a presentation about the Rokudenashiko incident by Ai Kano, PhD student at the Tokyo University of Fine Art. At the post-symposium dinner, a member of the audience, the Hong Kong based designer and a farmer Michael Leung, said ""We should do an exhibition for her in Hong Kong!”</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
</span></p>
<p>At the table there were several people from Woofer Ten, including Professor Mouri of the Tokyo University of the Arts and Hitomi Hasegawa, Hong Kong based Japanese curator. They decided to do an exhibition for her. Ms Hasegawa created the concept and selected some artists, and Lee Chun Fung, an artist and initiator of Woofer Ten, added several emerging artists from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>There are several issues raised by Rokudenashiko's case such as: censorship, infringement of freedom of expression: Japanese legal issues (conflicts of the Article 175 and the Article 21, concerning freedom of expression): digital art, internet issues, new technology such as 3D data, printing and obscenity: feminism, feminist art, including how genitalia has been applied to visual art.</p>
<p>
</p>

The project will start by gathering some works relating to genitalia.

</div></div>","(Rokudenashiko solo exhibition at Shinjyuku Ganka Garou, May, 2014)Thank you for your time and support!


Our goal is to realize an exhibition ‘Gender, Genitor, Genitalia - Rokudenashiko Tribute', the exhibition that was inspired by the incident of Megumi Igarashi, as known as Rokudenashiko who was arrested by her art works and now in the trial.

Firstly, we think it is important to let people know what is happening in Japan. Not only with Rokudenshiko, but also those LGBT artists in Japan who have been warned or arrested under the Obscenity Laws in the past three years. People in Hong Kong are aware of freedom of artistic expression and we believe that it is significant to realize this project in Hong Kong, a hub in Asia and also a location that is highly aware of, even threatened by, authoritarian politics. 
Secondly, relating to Rokudenashiko's incident, we will try to examine feminism in art and digital obscenity in this exhibition, within the context of the Hong Kong and Japanese experience. Through the works of art in this exhibition, and information provided about the Rokudenashiko case, we will be rethinking issues around feminism and genitalia in a cultural and political context. 

Additionally, hold a feminist exhibition featuring relatively young artists in Asia is important as not many shows have had this focus. 

Overall, we attempt to 1: revisit feminist art and works that directly refer to genitalia,  2: raise the issue of censorship through the case of Rokudenashiko, and 3: support Megumi Igarashi (the artist known as Rokudenashiko), who was arrested for creating artwork representing her vagina, and distributing 3D data of her vagina on the internet. 

We support Rokudenashiko by exhibiting her works and selling her 'Sof Vi Manko Chan' character, and donating the proceeds to the cost of her trial.

Background:


July 2014 in Tokyo, the artist Megumi Igarashi (also known as Rokudenashiko) has been arrested for distributing her vagina 3D data onto an internet crowdfunding site. This is believed to be in violation of the Japanese Obscenity Laws. She was released after a few days, then arrested again in December 2014. This time she was in police custody for the maximum duration in this type of case, 23 days.


The male genitals can be seen sometimes at traditional Japanese festivals, the ‘secret treasure’ museums and in some contemporary art works. Rokudenashiko believes that the vagina is overly hidden compared to the penis. She started working on this theme because she wants to liberate women from thinking of their vaginas as a dirty image. Her intention is to liberate women to become more open and uninhabited over their vaginas, and thus, equalize males and females. Her trial started in April 2015. She and a group of attorneys denied obscenity charges and argued censorship of artistic expression and Japan’s double standards. Pornographic cartoons are numerous in Japan, why were her works of arts selected for punishment?


In March 2015, there was a symposium organized by The Coming Society in Hong Kong. There was a presentation about the Rokudenashiko incident by Ai Kano, PhD student at the Tokyo University of Fine Art. At the post-symposium dinner, a member of the audience, the Hong Kong based designer and a farmer Michael Leung, said ""We should do an exhibition for her in Hong Kong!”


At the table there were several people from Woofer Ten, including Professor Mouri of the Tokyo University of the Arts and Hitomi Hasegawa, Hong Kong based Japanese curator. They decided to do an exhibition for her. Ms Hasegawa created the concept and selected some artists, and Lee Chun Fung, an artist and initiator of Woofer Ten, added several emerging artists from Hong Kong.


More about this project









There are several issues raised by Rokudenashiko's case such as: censorship, infringement of freedom of expression: Japanese legal issues (conflicts of the Article 175 and the Article 21, concerning freedom of expression): digital art, internet issues, new technology such as 3D data, printing and obscenity: feminism, feminist art, including how genitalia has been applied to visual art.


Rokudenashiko uses her vagina as the main theme of her art, and believes that her art helps to heighten women's self esteem and create gender equality. The project will start by gathering some works relating to genitalia. The works (by Aida, Rokudenashiko, Suzuki, Lam, Man, and Leung) will examine why those art works about genitalia are made and how they vary in concepts such as identity, political provocation, sexuality, an aesthetic point of view and so on.

Secondly, feminist art is usually a rare category of art in Asia, and not many
exhibitions on the theme have taken place in the past. We would like to align the works within a feminist context in Hong Kong and Japan, and consider whether the artists think they are feminists or not. Feminism is not a unified ideology, and several groups have different ideas. The exhibition includes different concepts of feminism, from different points of view; from 'Lipstick Feminism' (Robot, Sputniko!) to the more classical ideal of liberating woman from oppression (Suzuki, Man, Rokudenashiko). 
Gender issues in the digital world are an emerging issue. Some of the works deal with sexual desire and body politics in internet culture (Suzuki, Lam, Chan), which relates to our theme as Rokudenashiko was arrested for distributing her 3D vagina data.
How your funds would be used?
We will use your help to invite some artists and experts, including Rokudenashiko, to create a dialogue and discussion. And to realize the exhibition, we need:


Airfare and accommodation costs for the artists and talk guests,
Installation and exhibition cost,
Insurance, transportation, and  personnel cost,
Venue fees for exhibition and events,
Documentation cost,
Catalogue design and printing,
Equipment rental fees (as we have several videos).



Why should you support us?

We are highly dependent on volunteer work as Woofer Ten is an independent organisation run by artists and activists. Due to the controversial content of this exhibition, it is difficult for us to get any public or institutional funding. 




Again, it is important to let people know what is happening in Japan. Many members of the LGBT community, including Ryudai Takano, Leslie Kee and Mao Sugiyama, have been warned or arrested under the Obscenity Law in the last three years. 


In Hong Kong people are very aware of the authoritative interventions used against freedom of expression due to the Umbrella Movement and its aftermath. It would be important and intriguing to inform what is happening in Japan now through this exhibition.

<p>California Coalition for Women Prisoners (CCWP) is a grassroots, social justice organization with members inside and outside of prison. CCWP challenges the institutional violence imposed on women, transgender people, and communities of color by the prison industrial complex (PIC). CCWP understands the struggle for racial and gender justice as central to dismantling the PIC and prioritizes the leadership of the people, families, and communities most impacted in building this movement. CCWP began in 1995 when people inside the women's prisons filed a lawsuit against then-governor Pete Wilson rightfully claiming that the healthcare inside prison was so terrible it violated their 8th amendment rights.

<p>In India, we live in a tremendously unequal society.

in 2015.  Though my last one-day solo show,
“Kobiphysics,” had been a success, it has been over three years ago since I’ve
presented a solo show.  Since then I’ve
been able to exhibit in my work in London, New York, Thailand, Suriname,
Slovenia and Amsterdam.  That was all so
very lovely, and the experiences have changed my life… and I’ve evolved…</span></p>
<p>This year’s show is titled STATIC! and was initially
inspired by the life of Fred Hampton and his assassination by the FBI. 
The scope of inspiration broadened however, to incorporate the tense
fight for change and the authoritative abuse of power and police brutality.  It's important to have this loud artistic conversation about it.</p>

We are german art students ( http://www.klassemoulton.de ) and going to travel to the USA under the leading of the international known video- und performance artist Shana Moulton who is living in New York and teaching in Germany ( http://www.shanamoulton.info ).
Our art group, which is specialized in Performance and Video Art had already exhibitions, for example at the international FrauenFilmFestival in Dortmund ( http://www.frauenfilmfestival.eu/index.php?id=2319&L=0 ). We are now motivated to present our artworks in the USA. After some mind mapping we made the ""Squeezed identity"" as a subject of our discussions (This means the our digital presence, which shows our reality in a shortened and changed way). Finally our reflections ended by the ""squeezing"" as an action.
The squeezing is a research technique, which allows us an inside view in the ""squeezed things"" so that we can deconstruct it from the inside to the outside. By using this technique we would like to gain new experiences and visualize them. The topics range from the analyzation of a simple object, like a banana, to the critical review of the content of the reality. Your support allows us to continue our artistic research and to present it in the USA. Additionally you are supporting an artistic exchange on an international level.

Every support is helping us - even sharing our campaign!
We thank you for your interest and your help.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The history and stories of early Austin are an important bridge from Old Austin to New Austin.

The current studio is cramped, and weather dictates my dye schedule. The equipment needs an upgrade and the roof leaks heavily.  The temporary problems are easily solved with a more permanent solution!   What We Need & What You Get How your generosity is going to help:  First, we will secure indoor space without the need for acceptable weather, enabling year round dyeing. Next, we will upgrade our washer to a more efficient model. Finally, we will acquire a rotary press to enable us to deliver the best quality product, faster, and with an even more spectacular finish.

</div></div>","Starting from Scratch Hi! I'm Jessie Nilo.... I love art, artists, and God.


Eleven years ago there was no visual art at my church, so I launched a visual art ministry. People were skeptical. When we first started, we had:


No art studio... so we used the lobby, the chapel, the lawn, the classrooms...No artists on staff... I volunteered 5 hours a week.No art budget... people gave donations.

I've led this amazing, fun, and spiritually deep art ministry at my church for 11 years (we have a studio now!) and the number of lives I've seen impacted is unbelievable-- in the hundreds! And I've helped many other churches create art ministries and art environments of their own.
A Different Kind of Model I long for artists all over the world to be loved and welcomed into their own church communities. That's a big deal, and sadly neglected in most churches. The flip side is that most churches have a huge, gaping hole where their artistic side should be. Churches need artists to show them how art can help their congregations grow spiritually.  
That's why I'm launching Art Fruition.com -- to help churches love artists, and to help artists love the local church, wherever God calls them. My model centers on Christ and emphasizes ""everyone gets to play"" (there are places for all levels to participate). 


Art Fruition will be completely online, so people around the world will engage right where they live, applying what they're learning in their own creative communities!

What I Have 



11 years running an art ministry with a team of 20 artists


8 years teaching visual art for the city


3 years teaching visual art curriculum in private art high schools


2 BFAs (Illustration and Graphic Design)


50+ art ministry videos on my YouTube channel since 2009


a jillion art topics to teach on and piles of Moleskine journals filled with ministry stories, drawings, courage, and God-insights to share

the Art Fruition team and faculty
an awesome curriculum ready to train future art ministers

  What We Need  A few months ago my Canon camera and Mac laptop were stolen downtown. Undaunted, I took out a loan and bought another camera and laptop to make art lessons. My insurance didn't cover the theft.
Our most immediate expenses are:



Replacement camera $1000


Replacement laptop $2500


Recording and editing gear $1000


Online learning platform $1000


Business, internet, administrative costs $2000


Art faculty and contributors $3500

Books and supplies $1000

         -------------------------      Total:  Twelve thousand smackers. And if we get more, we can give scholarships!

What You Get
A terrific feeling knowing God is on the move, as well as beautiful artwork of your choice! To see the art perks, keep scrolling down to the end of our story. Thanks for contributing! 
But whether or not you contribute financially: Please enjoy this FREE 25-minute art lesson on ""plein air drawing & painting"" outdoors. You could say it's about finding freedom in mistakes. Watch full-screen if you like, and share with ANYONE who needs a bit of creative courage.

    The Impact of This Art School Movements begin small. But this one is growing quickly. I want to train people so churches can do this thing responsibly. Many hearts are at stake.
By contributing, YOU will:



help regular folks discover creativity, 


introduce artists around the globe to a God who loves them, and


teach churches TONS of practical ways to embrace beauty with wide-open inclusiveness and breathtaking excellence. Yes, it can be done.


Bonus: In our Indiegogo ""Updates"" tab, I'll post each time a new student enrolls in Art Fruition! :)

    Risks & Challenges Keeping my gear updated and running without getting stolen. I carry extra vigilance and insurance now.
Making video lessons will be challenging. But I made 52 videos on YouTube without knowing if I had an audience. A New Zealand art minister contacted me after watching through every one of my videos, and she urged me to PLEASE. KEEP. MAKING. VIDEOS.  How could I not?

</h3>
<strong></strong>
<p><b>H</b>i, my name is zen Sutherland and for the last 8 months I have been on a quirky little mission to create hand-painted oval magnets and put them on random cars - mostly in
the Asheville, NC area, but wherever I travel.  Each one is a little art oval created with love and placed around town on vehicles and anything they'll stick to - for people to find and share if they want. I do not sell them and I encourage people to swap them or take them for their own. They will never be
sold, only randomly given (and as perks here). The art project itself has been featured in the news-site <a href=""http://ashvegas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ashvegas</a> and in the book ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/onlyinavl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Only In Asheville</a>.""<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436617967/nw36psvrmrhy8fux8vjz.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 239.868px; height: 316px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436617988/awewgnmuhgrdyuwuhcwu.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 379.086px; height: 315px;""/></p><br/>
<p>It’s all about play. Using spray paint, stencils, rollers
and pens, I create little works of art on 4x6” oval magnets. Each is mostly unique in color, composition and design, though some have been similar as I
explore images and abstracts that I like and play with.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436618099/wu2vb0p82qmw4dwexec0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Each handmade ROMP has a sticker on the back with the address of the Facebook website where people can share photos of found (and lost) and a QR code with the same information. It's kind of a secret community - or maybe it's not-so-secret group as some parents have said that their kids watch for them on the backs of cars and call them out when they see one.<br/><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>What I Hope to Create<br/>
</h3>
<p><b>I</b>’ve already spend a good deal of money putting out some 400-500
random magnets in the Asheville area, and now need to bump up production to at
least 1000. At this quantity I can get blank magnets at the most reasonable bulk
rate. So the money will go to buy the blank oval magnets, spray paint, markers, blades and
template material that I’m almost out of. 
I’ve been using the cheapest spray paint I could find, but want to
upgrade to decent low-pressure, quick drying paint that will not only help the ROMPs last longer, but will allow me to ramp up output.</p>
<p><b>I</b>’d also like to create a decent ROMP website.  While the Facebook page has been
helpful in getting the word out there about this, but I long for a larger
community that can post their own photos of ROMPs seen and on the places people
decide to put them. </p>

Hi, my name is zen Sutherland and for the last 8 months I have been on a quirky little mission to create hand-painted oval magnets and put them on random cars - mostly in
the Asheville, NC area, but wherever I travel.  Each one is a little art oval created with love and placed around town on vehicles and anything they'll stick to - for people to find and share if they want. I do not sell them and I encourage people to swap them or take them for their own. They will never be
sold, only randomly given (and as perks here). The art project itself has been featured in the news-site Ashvegas and in the book ""Only In Asheville.""
It’s all about play. Using spray paint, stencils, rollers
and pens, I create little works of art on 4x6” oval magnets. Each is mostly unique in color, composition and design, though some have been similar as I
explore images and abstracts that I like and play with.Each handmade ROMP has a sticker on the back with the address of the Facebook website where people can share photos of found (and lost) and a QR code with the same information. It's kind of a secret community - or maybe it's not-so-secret group as some parents have said that their kids watch for them on the backs of cars and call them out when they see one.What I Hope to Create

I’ve already spend a good deal of money putting out some 400-500
random magnets in the Asheville area, and now need to bump up production to at
least 1000. At this quantity I can get blank magnets at the most reasonable bulk
rate. So the money will go to buy the blank oval magnets, spray paint, markers, blades and
template material that I’m almost out of. 
I’ve been using the cheapest spray paint I could find, but want to
upgrade to decent low-pressure, quick drying paint that will not only help the ROMPs last longer, but will allow me to ramp up output.
I’d also like to create a decent ROMP website.  While the Facebook page has been
helpful in getting the word out there about this, but I long for a larger
community that can post their own photos of ROMPs seen and on the places people
decide to put them. 
Just as importantly, I would like YOUR involvement. Many of
the perks include extra hand-made ROMP magnets to put on random cars in your
area – this is what I hope for most – that people will get to swapping magnets
and borrowing them on this ever-moving motorized canvas.I even put many on the back of my car (above) and encourage people to take one.Even if you decide that contributing to this crazy project
isn’t for you, please watch the progress on the ROMP Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/ROMPasheville

<p><br/>
 My name is Hilary, I am an American artist originally from 
California. I have been living in Southern Sicily for the past 9 years. 
During this time I have witnessed the increasing crisis of refugees 
stranded on overcrowded boats trying to find sanctuary on our shores. In
 2013 there was a terrible tragedy off the Island of Lampedusa, with the
 loss of over 300 lives in sight of land. Some of those people are 
buried in the town where I live: Cianciana. Last year I finished a small
 project composed of 10 masks, commemorating the nameless victims. I am a
 migrant myself, although my journey to Sicily was far less harrowing. 
We feel a personal connection to people seeking <i><b>either through choice or need a new existence</b></i>. We are all each other in some way.  A <i><b>Sea of Humanity</b></i><br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>THE FIRST 26. . . .<i><b>The masks will represent the many nameless victims of these journeys, you can lend your name.</b></i>
</h3>
<p>These are the first 16 masks, I have created.  IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A SPECIFIC 
MASK, THAT IS FINE. JUST REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE PART OF A LARGER PROJECT
 AND WILL NOT BE DELIVERED UNTIL AFTER THE EXHIBITION. <i><b>20% OF EACH 
PURCHASE WILL BE DONATED TO MEDICI SENZA FRONTIERI (DOCTORS WITHOUT 
BORDERS).  GRAZIE!</b></i></p>

    The Impact


 The news is filled with  negative and fear inspiring bias concerning the movement of people. Whether from war torn or impoverished countries, I think we have a common humanity that obliges us to assist each other where and when we can. 
Art can be a profound and personal way to share our opinions and visions, and to understand more about our relationships as fellow human beings. I hope this Sea of Humanity piece will promote discussion about more positive and humanitarian solutions. I am also raising money for Medici Senza Frontiere (Medicins Sans Frontiere), which has consistently been on the front line of humanitarian disasters, offering the most necessary and humane assistance.  Note: I am in no way connected to or funded by this charity, it is just the group that speaks to me most profoundly.
The exhibition will take place here in Cianciana at Passareddu Artist Residency. We formed Passareddu last year, as place for art exhibitions, cultural exchange and local and visiting events. It is constructed from second hand shipping containers, pallets and love. Passareddu has hosted numerous successful events during it's inaugural year, and is the ideal setting for this project.     The Challenge


 The primary challenge is the individual creation of so many masks by next summer.  It is a challenge worthy of our combined efforts, and exactly the kind of spirit and cooperation I hope to inspire with the completed project.

<p><b>Most of this funding goal is going towards
paying the people that worked on the project: </b></p>
<p>The rest of the budget is promotional and marketing. Since we are self
publishing through IngramSpark, a print on demand service, there are almost no up
front printing costs. We are lucky to live in a world where we have access to
this technology! If we went a traditional self publishing route, we would need
to pay for at least 1,000 copies of the book upfront and need to pay for
shipping them to individuals. Our start up costs are so low because we don't have to do that. With Print
on Demand, we receive a small royalty for each book sold, and IngramSpark prints
the book as people order them online. Going the self publishing route also means
we have creative control and can keep the book community-based. This
also means we are doing all our own marketing and promotion. That requires a
lot of work and costs money in merchandise, paper publicity and website
maintenance costs that we wouldn’t have if we went through a publishing house. </p>
<p>As
an illustrator, <b>Puja is paid $3,000 for
this project</b>; a flat rate for all illustrations for the book, and images
for promotional purposes (such as the images you saw in the video). This is a
rate that Puja and I came up with together. From our research, this rate is
comparable or better than the average for this volume of work. For myself, I
projected that if I were to be paid hourly, I would receive around $7,000 for
the creation of the book (10hrs/week at $20/hour for 35 weeks), however<b> I am paying myself the same as Puja</b>. I
don’t expect to be fully compensated for my own passion project in the way I
would be paid for a contracted job of the same nature. However, <b>it's
important to compensate myself and Puja well </b>for a couple of reasons:</p>
<p>-  We are dedicating
an immense amount of time to this project that would otherwise go towards traditional
paid work</p>
<p>-  We are setting an
example that young, female entrepreneurs can pursue creative work that improves
the world without running themselves into a financial hole. I strongly believe
we can all do great work, make the world a better place and pay the bills. The
only way to do that is to advocate for ourselves and believe in ourselves. </p>
<p>-  As women, its incredibly
important to be cognizant of our learned tendency to undervalue ourselves and
our work. By paying ourselves well, we are pushing against that societal voice of ""not worthy,"" by saying ""yes, we are.""</p>
<p><b>The Perks</b></p>
<p>We
are so excited to be offering you some fun perks! Quick note about Indiegogo
fees and such. I won’t bore you with math (unless you’re interested!), but the
10% budgeted for fees only includes any Paypal contributions, but only credit card contributions of $15+. If you donate less than $15
we are super super grateful and excited, I’m just letting you that more than 10%
of your donation will end up going to fees if you use a credit card. Paypal doesn't make a difference. </p><p>On a more fun note, I want to let you know that <b>each perk includes the perks from smaller amounts, too!</b></p>
<p><i>$1 Virtual Hug!</i> Holy moly, who couldn’t use another hug in
their day?! </p>
<p><i>$5 Shout out on Social Media!</i> Like so many social medias – all the tweets
and grams and posts </p>
<p><i>$15 Digital Reject Zine!</i> We are compiling all the pick up lines that
didn’t make it into the book into a super fun digital zine</p>
<p><i>$50 Temporary Tattoos &amp; Digital
Copy of Pick Me Up! </i>We’ll mail you some sweet temporary tattoos –
your 12 year old self will be so jealous. Also, you’ll receive the <i>Pick Me Up</i> E-Book!</p>
<p><i>$100 Pick Me Up &amp; Thank you in the

Pick Me Up, maybe we’ll even sign it! And you will be prominently included in

<p><i>$250 Tote Bag!</i><b> </b>In addition to the goodies above, we’ll throw

at the bar and buy cute strangers’ drinks on us.</p>
<p><i>$1,000 Dinner with Us &amp; Your Pick

will receive the <i>Dinner Date On Us
</i>perk instead, <i>and</i> still get to contribute the pick up line of your
choice in <i>Pick Me Up. </i>Pick up line
must be chosen by June 30<sup>th</sup>, 2016.  </p>
<p><b>What if we don’t reach our goal?</b></p>
<p>Puja gets paid first and foremost. Artists have to be paid, otherwise who will make beautiful things for us? The first thing to go will be
the payment for my time and effort. If we don’t reach our goal, it was me who
didn’t do my job fully, so its only fair. But lets not think like that. No
matter what, this journey and this book has value far beyond $8K!</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Like all creative endeavors, we are going to hit some bumps
in the road. We already have! This was originally supposed to be a Kickstarter
campaign and it was planned to launch a week later than it has. It was totally
the right call to make the switch, but it was stressful!  </p>
<p>I love this project and trust us to bring it to
life. It is a beautiful idea that is visiting us and we are just along for the
ride. Any problems are just opportunities to learn and grow, even if they feel
dumb and stressful at the time. I’m sure our plans will change and things will
materialize in ways we cannot predict. I’m ready and open to that. It’s
actually more fun then everything going to plan, right? </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Money is not the goal of this project, community is. If
you can’t, or just don’t want to give money to the project, help in other ways.
Tell people about the project online, or even better, in person! People trust
people, and having your stamp of approval on our idea is a huge honor. If you

<p></p>
<p>The Harmoniscope requires participants to work together in order to decipher the mystery of how it works and why it’s here.

Those willing to make the extra effort of aligning the reactor core will be rewarded with a dramatic sound and lighting event that energizes and triggers the journey to another location in space and time. Our project goal is to make it easy enough to decipher, that a group of people will align it successfully a majority of the time.  </p>
<p>As with any journey to Burning Man, the ultimate destination will be determined by the participants. As they leave the Harmoniscope, their minds will be altered from how they entered by virtue of their experience, their dreams, and their desires.  </p>

To contact us please email MaudSulterPassion@gmail.com or find us on Facebook<div>Maud Sulter (1960-2008) was an award-winning artist and writer of Ghanaian and Scottish descent who lived and worked in Britain. Her significance today lies in her dramatic and bold re-invention of the imagery of Black women and her art emphasises the long-standing presence of Africa in western art and modernity. She exhibited widely and represented Britain at <em>Africus</em>, the Johannesburg Biennale of 1995. Her art has been acquired by numerous private and public collections. <em>As A Blackwoman</em> was the title of her first collection of poems, and this perspective shaped her work as an artist, writer, curator, film-maker and cultural historian.

To contact us please email MaudSulterPassion@gmail.com or find us on FacebookMaud Sulter (1960-2008) was an award-winning artist and writer of Ghanaian and Scottish descent who lived and worked in Britain. Her significance today lies in her dramatic and bold re-invention of the imagery of Black women and her art emphasises the long-standing presence of Africa in western art and modernity. She exhibited widely and represented Britain at Africus, the Johannesburg Biennale of 1995. Her art has been acquired by numerous private and public collections. As A Blackwoman was the title of her first collection of poems, and this perspective shaped her work as an artist, writer, curator, film-maker and cultural historian. She edited a pioneering collection of writings and images, Passion: Discourses on Blackwomen’s Creativity, founded Urban Fox Press, networked internationally in Black feminist and lesbian movements, curated nearly 20 exhibitions, and set up a gallery, Rich Women of Zurich in central London.

What We Need & What You Get

SELF Festival can be realized thanks to the enthusiastic work of the organizations International ArtExpo, It's LIQUID Group, Venice Art House and Ca' Zanardi, with the contribution of each artist selected and involved in the different appointment.
Even if we don't achieve the funding goal, SELF Festival realization is GUARANTEED!
20,000 EU is the budget we need to IMPROVE the festival experience through:

Realization of a final catalogue which will talks about the experience of SELF Festival. The catalogue will be in A5 format, hardcover, 100 pages with text, pictures and photos. The catalogue will be printed in 5.000 copies to be shared during all the international future events of It's LIQUID and International ArtExpo, and in all the galleries and museums around the world which are partners of our organization, such as MuMo – Museum Montanelli in Prague, 
Laura Haber Gallery in Buenos Aires, MIXER gallery in Istanbul, MECA 
art center in Almeria, CCCB - Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona
in Spain, NCCA - National Center for Contemporary Arts of Moscow, The Ferry Gallery in Bangkok, BAC gallery in  Bogotà, etc.  


Facilitate art performers attendance. Art performers take part in the show for free, without paying any fee. We would like to be able to support them more, providing them with a pocket money useful to cover a part of their travel and accommodation expenses (for 2 days), and offering them all the needed technical equipment for their show. We usually host about 5 live performers for each event we organize. For the first appointments of the Festival in May, we will host the amazing live performance of Candida Kandinskij, a one-man band, industrial rock project, curated by the visual artist Giovanni De Benedetto; the experimental dance performance of Alexandra Foffano and Angelica Stecchi; the elegant dance choreography of Jonathan Tabacchiera.""Premature 23"" by Giovanni De Benedetto""Magma"" by Alexandra Foffano and Angelica Stecchi""Omaggio a Francesco Paolo Tosti"" by Jonathan Tabacchiera




Projecting art videos of famous international video artists, covering all the needed costs for screening them and for requested technical equipment. The more money we raise, the more amazing artists we will be able to project during the shows.

Hosting a rich program of talks and workshops to achieve an active participation and exchange between artists, academics and the general public. Among the workshops programmed, the artist and theorist Simonetta Moro, director of IDSVA, the Institute for Doctoral Studies in the Visual Arts

of Portland (USA), will present a huge art project at Venice Art House for the whole month of May 2015 and have lectures and workshops during the festival.Venice map installation by Simonetta Moro


Production of SELF's gadgets and promotional materials: 1.000 pencils, 1.000 bags, 5.000 stickers, 10.000 invitation cards.





At the end of the campaign, the total amount of budget we raise, will be divided among the different purposes.

The more donations we receive, the more stunning live performers,
 famous art video projections and significant workshops we will offer to
 the audience!

<h3>The Extended Version</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486073016/cy8mnpvaievfpzeyt8nd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are a group of female performance artists making a film that challenges the still ever present constructs of patriarchy! Our film questions societal roles and exposes the complex nature of femininity. We are making space for more diversty in a male dominated genre of filmmaking. TriTonia is an homage to grindhouse and slasher films which are commonly associated with the exploitation of women. Our film places women in a primal and animalistic place of power and leadership. To keep it real we're shooting on Super8 and 16mm film.</p>
<p>Three feral beings bound by the blood of companionship summon their prey through the macabre and erotic tunnels of their minds. Invested in the common necessity of survival, they meet their prey in violent and perverse encounters extracting the life force which momentarily allays their desires. Wandering through the moving image, our characters confront dualities of dream versus reality, deity or human, pain or pleasure, revenge or justice.

<h3>The Director: Marcelle Marais</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486070539/snsk7hfma9qtmo45fr81.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, multifaceted artist Marcelle Marais advances, pursues and indulges the creative discourse with a renegade abandon. Her work rips the socially constructed veils off the faces of genderism, power dynamics and the cycles of abuse in domestic relations. She explores the depths of memory in family myth constructions through exorcisms and ritual immolation of the Immaculata. Memory, too, is engaged with witchcraft, ritual, sex work, navigation of boundaries and psychological blood letting in pursuit of the restoration and empowerment of women. </p>

<h3>Why Celluloid Film?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486071338/xhtguayq1a67c1mozqdw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I’m filming Tritonia on Super8 and 16mm film. I've been shooting on celluloid film for many years and find it to possess deeply sensual and rich qualities that digital film is not capable of producing. There is something magical and tactile about working with film. It’s connected with the human instinct of touch and yet each frame captured on film has an element of chance associated with it. No shot can be replicated exactly the same way. There are many variables related to a specific moment in time that can never be experienced again such as the way light and color mix on the surface of film.  When you say ‘action’ and the film rolls you are capturing a sacred moment and participating in the creation of an illusion. Recording a series of still images and then projecting them over light at the speed of 24 frames per second creates an illusion of movement. It’s magic! Film is magic to me and I want to transport my viewers into visual portals reminiscent of dreams and the profound capabilities of the imagination. The sensuality of working with film is evocative and the medium that comes closest to resembling the experience of human memory. I believe film to be the only medium capable of capturing the metaphysical journey of Tritonia.</p>

We are a group of female performance artists making a film that challenges the still ever present constructs of patriarchy! Our film questions societal roles and exposes the complex nature of femininity. We are making space for more diversty in a male dominated genre of filmmaking. TriTonia is an homage to grindhouse and slasher films which are commonly associated with the exploitation of women. Our film places women in a primal and animalistic place of power and leadership. To keep it real we're shooting on Super8 and 16mm film.
Three feral beings bound by the blood of companionship summon their prey through the macabre and erotic tunnels of their minds. Invested in the common necessity of survival, they meet their prey in violent and perverse encounters extracting the life force which momentarily allays their desires. Wandering through the moving image, our characters confront dualities of dream versus reality, deity or human, pain or pleasure, revenge or justice. Follow the official TriTonia motion picture page on facebook at https://www.facebook.com/tritoniafilm/
A percentage of funds raised will be donated to Saint James Infirmary in San Francisco 
http://stjamesinfirmary.org/
Join us at our TriTonia fundraiser extravaganza on March 10th to ritualize and party hard in honor of our project and thank you in person for your support!

The Director: Marcelle Marais

Born and raised in Cape Town, South Africa, multifaceted artist Marcelle Marais advances, pursues and indulges the creative discourse with a renegade abandon. Her work rips the socially constructed veils off the faces of genderism, power dynamics and the cycles of abuse in domestic relations. She explores the depths of memory in family myth constructions through exorcisms and ritual immolation of the Immaculata. Memory, too, is engaged with witchcraft, ritual, sex work, navigation of boundaries and psychological blood letting in pursuit of the restoration and empowerment of women. 
 

Why Celluloid Film?

I’m filming Tritonia on Super8 and 16mm film. I've been shooting on celluloid film for many years and find it to possess deeply sensual and rich qualities that digital film is not capable of producing. There is something magical and tactile about working with film. It’s connected with the human instinct of touch and yet each frame captured on film has an element of chance associated with it. No shot can be replicated exactly the same way. There are many variables related to a specific moment in time that can never be experienced again such as the way light and color mix on the surface of film.  When you say ‘action’ and the film rolls you are capturing a sacred moment and participating in the creation of an illusion. Recording a series of still images and then projecting them over light at the speed of 24 frames per second creates an illusion of movement. It’s magic! Film is magic to me and I want to transport my viewers into visual portals reminiscent of dreams and the profound capabilities of the imagination. The sensuality of working with film is evocative and the medium that comes closest to resembling the experience of human memory. I believe film to be the only medium capable of capturing the metaphysical journey of Tritonia.

<h3>WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO</h3>
<p>Pretty &amp; Inked Magazine was founded by Editor-In-Chief Natasha MacKenzie to not only support the art of tattooing, but to positively promote successful tattooed women with the hope of dispelling any prejudices or misconceptions and championing body appreciation.</p>
<p>Having always had a fascination and appreciation for the art of tattooing, Nat found herself immersed in the tattoo culture and the amazing talent behind it. While the industry has grown so much in such a very short time there is still an existing negative stigma when it comes to tattooed women, and women in the industry. A belief that tattooed women will never amount to anything personally or professionally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492623935/bwh4bzjtjksftm6vsfyf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Aside from her own negative experiences, Nat has met women across the globe with disheartening stories where these beautiful and successful individuals feel self conscious in their inked skin. Tattoos have helped these women get through cancer, depression, illness and heartbreak and yet they are made to feel ashamed of what they have added to their skin to get through these life changing situations. Women who will wear winter clothing in the middle of July for fear of being verbally harassed in the street. Women who have become afraid to go out with friends for the chance of being grabbed by strangers and abused for their skin. Women who are told they would be prettier without them, and will never be a good wife or a good mother with them.</p>
<p>Determined to change this negative stigma in society, make tattooed women just as accepted publicly as they are in tattoo culture, and allow tattooed women to be more than mere sex objects, Nat pulled together a team of like-minded industry professionals and founded Pretty &amp; Inked Magazine. A magazine to educate the masses on the art of tattooing, go in-depth with tattoo artists and their unwaverable dedication to the craft, and to promote Tattoo Bettys - women who are successful, talented, beautiful and tattooed.</p>

<h3>WE CAN'T CHANGE THE WORLD WITHOUT YOU</h3>
<p>Pretty &amp; Inked Magazine started with two pre-issues before heading for our official launch, with Issue No.1, this fall. With your help we will not only be able to keep this magazine going and inspire these 'Tattoo Bettys' to be their wonderful selves, we will reach new heights and new borders when it comes to vanquishing this negative stigma and the realisation of tattoos as a fine art form.</p>
<p>Exclusive content, in-depth interviews, stunning photography, and heartwarming stories are just a few of the things this magazine can only get across on a printed page. It's an independent publication for an alternative mind.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491577929/ouadv5whxgpexvdnrwoc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p>

<h3>HOW YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL HELP</h3>
<p>You will be directly responsible for seeing our first official issue realised in print and helping us launch a new social change to a greater audience. Your contributions will go directly towards the cost of having the magazine physically made (printing and publishing) and the costs it takes to distribute this magazine (shipping and delivery).</p>
<p>By helping us increase the exposure of Pretty &amp; Inked in local shops and increasing distribution across the globe, you're not only helping us but the artists who spend hours on end honing their craft, and thousands of tattooed women around the world to be themselves. With the support of this initial launch not only will we be able to get Issue No.1 off the ground, we will be able to continue this publication for years to come.</p>
<p>Of course for all of this to happen we need funding to not only print and distribute the first issue, but to give us a launching pad to start to grow the publication. For our lovely supporters who have seen our pre-issues, they were only a glimpse into what Pretty &amp; Inked is bringing to your coffee tables with Issue No.1. The overall design and content of the magazine goes further into the art, the education behind tattoos, in-depth never before seen interviews with the masters in the industry, and double features on amazing tattooed women from around the globe and their inspiring stories on how they overcame difficulty, negativity, and adversity. And of course, paired with some jaw-dropping photography.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our independent publication is run purely on the support of like-minded individuals determined to change the world's view on tattoos and tattooed women. Running this magazine out of our own pockets for the last two issues we are now at a point where we cannot keep going without your contributions. Blood, sweat, tears, and countless sleepless hours go into each issue and we wouldn't have it any other way. We believe in what we are trying to achieve, but have reached a point where we cannot make as much of an impact without you.</p>
<p>If our funding goals are not met Issue No.1 will be printed and head into stores and around the globe, but this would mean even greater challenges lie ahead of us than the one we are facing right now. A mission to change the world requires passion and funding, we have buckets of passion we just need help with the funding.</p>

<h3>Honoring The Divine Feminine Through Body Paint</h3>
<p>My soul purpose for body painting is, not only to show the beauty of the human figure, but also to honor this as a true Art form. Body painting allows me to pay homage to the goddess that lives in all, male and female alike, and to open channels for Healing.<br/>I hope this book inspires you to follow your dreams and to recognize your own Divinity.<br/>This long-awaited project has finally come to fruition with the help of countless friends and photographers who all believed in the idea and donated their time and energy.</p>
<h3>Featured Goddesses</h3>
<p>I illustrated the goddess in all cultures and faiths. My intention was to lift up the divine feminine and help balance the energy between our masculine and feminine aspects; to bring us to our rightful place in what has been thousands of years of patriarchal rule. Every new step was guided and every wish, even when I didn’t know how, was shown to me from Great Spirit, the Divine. If I only touch one of you, then I’ve reached my goal.<br/>In my naivety, I thought I would race through and complete my goal within a year. But then life happened. Some setbacks were necessary, allowing for what I needed at the right time, others were a matter of conflicting schedules, but I never gave up. Five years later, I am overjoyed to bring you: Honoring the Divine Feminine Through Body Paint.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Support ART! Buy a book or contribute...</h2>
<p>Imagine creating your own fantasy world...<br/>An idea can manifest itself into a scene complete with body painting, custom backgrounds, props and costume wear. That's what I do!<br/>This project requires a lot of love and some money to get it out to the world.   When you support this project, you receive a ton of love from me as well as a great quality coffee table book, prints or a body painting session of my work. </p>

<p>Amy Young's 30+year career in airbrush artistry has left its mark on the walls and bodies of Austin and the surrounding area. Her whimsical work includes several Austin-area outdoor murals -- just try to spot the floating pancakes at Kerbey Lane on the Drag. Her large body of paintings on canvas and masonite feature goddess-themed interpretations of fellow fire performers. Look quickly when you hear a Harley and you might see some of her work flying down I-35 or gracing a roaring hood in the Art Car Parades of Houston or Austin. Amy's extensive variety of body painting work spans every age group and interest from childrens' birthday parties to Carnival and Renaissance festivals.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Honoring The Divine Feminine Through Body Paint
My soul purpose for body painting is, not only to show the beauty of the human figure, but also to honor this as a true Art form. Body painting allows me to pay homage to the goddess that lives in all, male and female alike, and to open channels for Healing.I hope this book inspires you to follow your dreams and to recognize your own Divinity.This long-awaited project has finally come to fruition with the help of countless friends and photographers who all believed in the idea and donated their time and energy.
Featured Goddesses
I illustrated the goddess in all cultures and faiths. My intention was to lift up the divine feminine and help balance the energy between our masculine and feminine aspects; to bring us to our rightful place in what has been thousands of years of patriarchal rule. Every new step was guided and every wish, even when I didn’t know how, was shown to me from Great Spirit, the Divine. If I only touch one of you, then I’ve reached my goal.In my naivety, I thought I would race through and complete my goal within a year. But then life happened. Some setbacks were necessary, allowing for what I needed at the right time, others were a matter of conflicting schedules, but I never gave up. Five years later, I am overjoyed to bring you: Honoring the Divine Feminine Through Body Paint.

Support ART! Buy a book or contribute...
Imagine creating your own fantasy world...An idea can manifest itself into a scene complete with body painting, custom backgrounds, props and costume wear. That's what I do!This project requires a lot of love and some money to get it out to the world.   When you support this project, you receive a ton of love from me as well as a great quality coffee table book, prints or a body painting session of my work. 
 
Body Art + Self-love About the Artist

Amy Young's 30+year career in airbrush artistry has left its mark on the walls and bodies of Austin and the surrounding area. Her whimsical work includes several Austin-area outdoor murals -- just try to spot the floating pancakes at Kerbey Lane on the Drag. Her large body of paintings on canvas and masonite feature goddess-themed interpretations of fellow fire performers. Look quickly when you hear a Harley and you might see some of her work flying down I-35 or gracing a roaring hood in the Art Car Parades of Houston or Austin. Amy's extensive variety of body painting work spans every age group and interest from childrens' birthday parties to Carnival and Renaissance festivals.

<p>For this performance, I have reached out to fellow musicians I know from my own music practice as well as students in both the MFA programs at Mills' dance and music schools.Their expertise costs time and money and as part of conjuring up a more equitable world, it is key that any and all who participate get compensation for their time and talent. <strong>This is the primary reason why I am seeking funding for this work.</strong></p>

<h4>
My
name is Zuzana Mantel, I live in the Czech Republic and I'm a painter and mosaics maker. I paint light and color,
emotion and vibration. I want to catch magic moments of our life. My
creation is focused on natural and human forms. I create with love.</h4>
<p>
My
art captivated many art lovers, critics and curators. After a
successful presentation at Tokyo International Art Fair in May 2015
I've got many invitations to exhibit in Europe and USA. I'm really
delighted by the interest and I would like to deliver a direct
contact of my works with the observers. I know, from my own
experience, that watching the art and being surrounded by it brings
joy and new pieces of knowledge.</p>
<p>
<b>Why
is it important to me, what is my goal</b></p>
<p>
Right
now, it's unable to finance all the exhibitions from my private
resources. By way of the crowd founding I'm asking for your support.
As a reward I offer to you ownership of one my original artworks.</p>

name is Zuzana Mantel, I live in the Czech Republic and I'm a painter and mosaics maker. I paint light and color,
emotion and vibration. I want to catch magic moments of our life. My
creation is focused on natural and human forms. I create with love.

My
art captivated many art lovers, critics and curators. After a
successful presentation at Tokyo International Art Fair in May 2015
I've got many invitations to exhibit in Europe and USA. I'm really
delighted by the interest and I would like to deliver a direct
contact of my works with the observers. I know, from my own
experience, that watching the art and being surrounded by it brings
joy and new pieces of knowledge.

Why
is it important to me, what is my goal

Right
now, it's unable to finance all the exhibitions from my private
resources. By way of the crowd founding I'm asking for your support.
As a reward I offer to you ownership of one my original artworks.

<h3>Get The Doodlecats On The Road</h3>
<p>Our ideas are getting bigger, along with our business and because we tend to come up with things nobody has tried yet, it can be difficult to find venues that will allow us to experiment. A  Doodlecat Bus would enable us to follow where our imaginations lead. And to take a great big bunch of Doodlecats with us when we do. This first phase of crowdfunding will help us obtain a 53 seater coach and, crucially, get it legal and on the road. In a marvellous bit of unintended forward planning (something we excel at) our DJ is also a bus driver!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our ideal vehicle is a coach - big enough to take a bunch of people and their luggage to a festival or on tour. We're looking at elderly ex service coaches, which sell for around £3000. We need something with loads of baggage store space where we will install the water tanks that'll make it possible for us to body marble thousands of people whilst being responsible with our waste water. Something sturdy that won't complain if we attach a stage to the side or a slide from the roof... </p>
<p>Eventually the plan is to remove half of the  seats to create a versatile open plan performance space which we're calling The Back of The Bus. We'll make this available to other rebellious artistic endeavours for cheap or free, and we'll hire it to less rebellious endeavours to create a fund to support new art and activism. </p>
<p>Our perks, unsurprisingly are pretty much all BUS based! From G&amp;T parties on the beautiful South Downs to a bus based Playpen experience for you and 30 mates, there are a range of pledge amounts so that you can give us some love without breaking the bank. We're doing a flexible fund, because we're good at making do with what we've got (that's doodling!) and any contribution will help us do more things - but should it transpire that we don't achieve our goal of purchasing a bus, you will have the option of our doodled up substitute perk (like maybe we have to hire someone else's bus for a picnic) or getting your money refunded. </p>
<p>The Philosophy Of Doodle, upon which all our events (and our business model) are based has taught me that too much of a plan is never a good thing. Bodydoodling and indeed The Doodlecats were not so much a plan as a response to what YOU all told us you wanted. Once we have the bus, the directions in which we choose to point it will occur the same way.</p>
<p>In Doodle (and YOU) we trust.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Dawn Rosner, The Glassy Geek (so named because most of my art
reflects my love of geek culture).  I'm a stained glass artist raising two
boys on my own.  My younger son, now 16 years old, has autism, and I'm his
sole care giver.  Working from my home-based studio allows me to be
available to provide him with the level of care he requires; however, art is
often a hit-or-miss career, and it can be a financial struggle at times. 
Your generous donations will allow me to continue to make ends meet for my
boys, provide my younger son with the care he requires, and help finance
supplies so I can create even bigger and better works of art to continue
working to support my family.  My thanks to you will be a reward of dragon
art you can enjoy for years to come. </p>
<p>I have been making stained glass on and off for a couple of decades. 
About 5 years ago, I turned my passion for geek culture into a stained glass
art career, and started selling as The Glassy Geek online and at Florida science fiction
and comic conventions.  I work in both copper foil and lead came, and
incorporate fused glass pieces into some of my designs.  I also make fused
glass jewelry.  Some of my work has appeared on display at the John F.
Germany Public Library in Tampa, FL, and at the Transmetropolitan Gallery in Orlando, FL.<br/></p>

</div>","It's a familiar yet tragic story...at the end of the quest, when the adult
dragons have been slain and the knights have returned to the keep, young
dragons, injured or orphaned, are left to fend for themselves. 
Many are lost.

(Orphaned young dragon)
Some, however, are rescued by The Glassy Geek*, who
tirelessly rehabilitates and trains the young dragons, and works hard to find
them loving, forever homes. 
Unfortunately, funds are low, and resources are limited, making it difficult to
care for all the dragons left behind.(*The Glassy Geek is an artist working hard to support a special needs son in a single parent household during these difficult economic times, yet still makes the effort to provide the very best in dragon outreach and care.  See below the Rewards section to learn more.)
That's where YOU come in.  Your generous donation can help fund The
Glassy Geek's new Center for the Rehabilitation Of Wild Dragons (CROWD).  The CROWD Fund will allow for expanded dragon saving services, including care
and treatment, house-training for young dragons, and much needed wing
prostheses for injured dragons.  (feeding dragon fruit to a litter of rescued immature dragons)Best of all, the CROWD Fund will enable
us to allow some of YOU, the generous benefactors, to care for injured or
orphaned dragons in the comfort of your own homes.

(Rescued and trained young female dragon, recently re-homed)

We know that not everyone is in a position to make a
large donation, and not everyone feels ready to care for a dragon.  That's
why CROWD Fund contributors are encouraged to give at whatever level suits them
best.  Every contribution, large and small, is appreciated and rewarded.  

(dragons in supervised flight training at CROWD. Notice the rare frost dragon at bottom of group)For the
cost of a single cup of coffee (espresso based, probably a venti), CROWD Fund contributors
will receive a Save the Dragons logo decal; a larger donation will earn
you a CROWD Save the Dragons logo t-shirt.  A donation of a mere penny a day (for the equivalent of 4,000 days) will allow you to adopt a fully recovered and trained orphan dragon,
while a more generous contribution will allow you to help care for a very
special wounded dragon, perhaps one whose prosthetic wing was funded by you
yourself!  So many dragons come into the CROWD clinic in serious condition, but The Glassy Geek carefully treats each one to aid the dragons on their paths to healthy, fulfilling lives.(wounded dragon being examined at CROWD clinic)Using cutting-edge technology, the CROWD clinic is able to help seriously wounded dragons with everything from scale grafts to partial transplants.  In cases where transplants won't take, the latest in prosthetic technology is employed.  The CROWD clinic is proud to boast a 99.9% success rate in rehabilitating even the most seriously wounded dragons!(same dragon as above after receiving expert dragonfly wing partial transplant from compatible species Dragonflyus Giganticus)As you can understand, it takes a lot of resources to provide these kinds of services.  Every one of your pennies is appreciated!  Got way too many pennies?  Well, those in a position to help us fund for the future with the
largest donations will receive a special commemorative dragon stained glass
panel.  (See details for each available contribution level.)
Day after day, quest after quest, young dragons
are being left behind.  Your donations, large and small, could make all
the difference.  Won't you please help?

(iridescent pale blue dragon seeking a forever home at re-homing event)

Okay, they're hanging stained glass dragons...but here at CROWD, we believe no
dragon should be left homeless and suffering in this day and age, especially
not well-trained, stained glass dragons.  Please consider helping The
Glassy Geek's dragon friends find their forever homes!Your kindness and generosity, and love of
dragons, means more to us than just a word of thanks!  Here’s how CROWD will reward your donations:Of course you get our undying gratitude, but you also get a virtual hug from across the Internet!  (You may request a substitute hearty virtual handshake if you aren't the hugging type.)
For about the price of one cup of coffee, you can support dragon rehabiliation and show off your support with a removable vinyl
featuring simplified CROWD logo.  It may be placed on pretty much any smooth
surface, such as car windows, laptops, walls, refrigerators, and so on.



For the cost of just three cappuccinos (or a decent sandwich with fries), you'll receive an autographed copy of Dragon Run by Patrick Matthews!  This perk is limited to the first ten people to claim it.Fused glass pendant featuring a sepia tone Welsh dragon on an ivory glass background, set against lovely clear red glass, hung from a
standard cord necklace that you may keep or replace with your own chain.  Each one is hand made by The Glassy Geek, and will therefore be unique (shapes will vary due to hand made nature of this item).

Unisex t-shirt, either digital or screen printed (depending
on quantity claimed), just like those worn by CROWD clinic staff!  Shirts will probably be a light
heather gray, but other color choices or styles may become available.  We will contact you via email to get your shirt preferences.
For a slightly reduced rate over the first wave (see below), the second wave of orphaned dragons will ship starting in
January 2016 (if you’d like one in time for Christmas, please see the next
reward).  You'll have your choice of glass colors.  When you choose
to re-home an orphaned dragon, you'll be contacted with a color list from which
to choose.  You may also choose a body color of silver or black.  After all,
there are so very many orphaned dragons, I'm sure we can find just the right
dragon for you.  So, you want to take an orphaned dragon home in time for the
holidays!  You’re so nice.  If you claim your orphan before November 21,
you’ll be sent an email with the full list of color choices.  If you claim your orphan after that date,
your color choices may be limited by availability, since there will be less
time to get your new dragon to his or her forever home in time for the
holidays.  URGENT UPDATE!  Recent quests along the Atlantic coastline have created a need for homes for several of these special little dragons.  Don't let the toothy grin of a coastal dragon fool you--these little 
fellows are as sweet as can be, with a jewel-like glint in their eyes!  Wave #2 of the Coastal Dragon Orphan adoptions goes out beginning in January 2016.URGENT UPDATE!  Recent quests along the Atlantic coastline have left a number of adolescent Coastal Dragons in need of care and forever homes!  A handful of them will be fully rehabilitated and trained in time to arrive in their forever homes in time for the holidays.  Since there are a limited number of these dragons ready to travel, your color choices may be somewhat limited, but we'll do all we can to find just the right forever friend for you!The Glassy Geek has a special needs child, and cares for
special needs dragons, so knows first hand that their needs aren't ALL that's
special about them!  Each of the Special Needs Dragons will be completely
unique, and may incorporate metal or 3D printed plastic prosthetics, missing
pieces of wing, or bandages.  If the dragon is in recovery, he or she may
come with a pet cone (a.k.a. Cone of Shame) to prevent self-injury.  I assure you, every special
needs dragon is beautiful, and deserving of an abundance of love!  If you'd like your special needs dragon to arrive before the Christmas holiday, please select a Special Needs Dragon Wave #1 instead.
A few of our special needs dragons will be ready to adopt
just in time for the Christmas holiday!  See description above for Special Needs Dragon, Wave #2 for more information.  Special dragons need special homes!

Second wave of our “I Love Dragons” rewards package will
begin shipping in February 2015, and will include  a special needs dragon (or, if you prefer, a fully rehabilitated dragon), a Save the Dragons t-shirt, and a
Save the Dragons vinyl decal.  All of your
items will arrive together.  Delivery
time will depend on number of perks claimed.

First
wave of our “I Love Dragons” rewards package will ship in two phases.  You will receive  a special needs dragon (or, if you prefer, a fully rehabilitated dragon), and a Save the Dragons vinyl decal, which
will ship out on or before December 21, 2015. 
You will also receive a Save the Dragons T-shirt and a decal.  Shirts will ship out beginning in January
2015. 

Created only as claimed, your dragon panel will be hand
made, and The Glassy Geek will consult with you to be sure the color scheme
will match your décor.  You will see a
photo of the proposed design to be sure it meets with your satisfaction before
the panel is made.  The Glassy Geek will send photos of the work in
various stages, so you can see how your panel is progressing.  Please be
advised that all stained glass perks are individually hand made by The Glassy
Geek, and that panels are time consuming to create.  Please allow several months for your panel to
be created just for you.As with the $500 reward level, your 10x12 inch stained glass

<p>My name is Kristen McNevins. I am a visual artist working primarily in photography and been given an amazing opportunity. At the end of this August I will leaving my home in Connecticut, and heading to Ireland to attend a 4 week artist residency at The Burren College of Art. I recently finished a series, Out of Habit,  in completion of MFA in photography from the Savannah College of Art and Design, and now that I am finished I am looking for opportunities to make my next series. Usually, I travel light when I make work,
relying on my camera and my immediate surroundings as a source of creativity.

<p>Right now, I don't have much of a studio space or any means

<div>
<p>In the heart of the deep playa, curious structures rise sharply from the dust.  From the exterior they resemble a rustic
workshop, littered with gears and gadgets that compose parts of a larger
puzzle.  Vintage furniture, flickering
chandeliers, and a welcoming porch beckon you to the entrance.  From the dimly-lit interior, faint strains of
jazz and tinkling laughter emanate into the night.  Welcome, dear and dusty traveller, to the
Black Rock Blind Tiger.</p>
<p></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Black Rock Blind Tiger is a novel speakeasy conceived
around the idea of participation and play. 
To gain access, you must solve the exterior puzzles and discover the
password that allows entry.  Not in the
mood for mysteries?  No worries,
friend—the Black Rock Blind Tiger offers something for everyone, whether it’s a
moment’s respite on the widow’s walk, or a garnished gift slipped to
you through a secret drawer. </span><br/></p>

<p>Our team of artists and builders have built one of the structures already.  We are now transforming a 30-foot
trailer into the interactive 1920s speakeasy for all Burning Man participants to
experience and enjoy.  We’ll have interactive gifts, scintillating conversation, and excellent jazz music to
keep you dancing the night away.  But the
Black Rock Blind Tiger is more than just a speakeasy.  Join us and delight in the curious art, the
unusual objects, and the many surprises that await you inside of the Black Rock
Blind Tiger. </p>

<br/>
</div>
<h3>The Inspiration</h3>
<div>
<p>The Black Rock Blind Tiger is inspired by prohibition-era
speakeasies, or secret drinking establishments that often required a password
to gain entry.  Occasionally thirsty people
skirted prohibition laws by acquiring “prescriptions” for “medicinal” drinks
that were otherwise unlawful.  Sometimes
these drinks were served through a secret drawer so that the identity of the
server was never revealed. The name “Blind Tiger” itself is code for an illegal
drinking establishment where the seller's identity was concealed.</p>

led by veteran Burning Man and Burning Flipside attendee Tiffaney Benson.  The team includes a 20+ person crew of artists,
mixologists, builders, designers, and do’ers.

<h3>Funding</h3>
<div>
<p>We’re raising funds to transform our vintage Silver Streak
trailer into a literal work of art.  To
date we have raised $5,000 through local fundraisers, but we have about $10,000
remaining to meet our goal.  Our major
expenses include building supplies, transportation, décor, gadgets, lighting, insurance, and tools.  For a
breakdown of our budget by category, see our Funding page:  <a href=""http://www.blackrockblindtiger.com/funding.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.blackrockblindtiger.com/funding.html</a></p>
<p>The Black Rock Blind Tiger is a volunteer-led project
supported entirely by our team members, fundraiser attendees, and Indiegogo
campaign backers.  Your support of our
campaign allows us to turn our dream of a community speakeasy on the playa into
a reality.  We have already acquired our
trailer and construction is currently underway! </p>

</div></div>","Welcome to the Black Rock Blind Tiger!

In the heart of the deep playa, curious structures rise sharply from the dust.  From the exterior they resemble a rustic
workshop, littered with gears and gadgets that compose parts of a larger
puzzle.  Vintage furniture, flickering
chandeliers, and a welcoming porch beckon you to the entrance.  From the dimly-lit interior, faint strains of
jazz and tinkling laughter emanate into the night.  Welcome, dear and dusty traveller, to the
Black Rock Blind Tiger.


The Black Rock Blind Tiger is a novel speakeasy conceived
around the idea of participation and play. 
To gain access, you must solve the exterior puzzles and discover the
password that allows entry.  Not in the
mood for mysteries?  No worries,
friend—the Black Rock Blind Tiger offers something for everyone, whether it’s a
moment’s respite on the widow’s walk, or a garnished gift slipped to
you through a secret drawer. 


Our team of artists and builders have built one of the structures already.  We are now transforming a 30-foot
trailer into the interactive 1920s speakeasy for all Burning Man participants to
experience and enjoy.  We’ll have interactive gifts, scintillating conversation, and excellent jazz music to
keep you dancing the night away.  But the
Black Rock Blind Tiger is more than just a speakeasy.  Join us and delight in the curious art, the
unusual objects, and the many surprises that await you inside of the Black Rock
Blind Tiger. 



The Inspiration

The Black Rock Blind Tiger is inspired by prohibition-era
speakeasies, or secret drinking establishments that often required a password
to gain entry.  Occasionally thirsty people
skirted prohibition laws by acquiring “prescriptions” for “medicinal” drinks
that were otherwise unlawful.  Sometimes
these drinks were served through a secret drawer so that the identity of the
server was never revealed. The name “Blind Tiger” itself is code for an illegal
drinking establishment where the seller's identity was concealed.


Inside the ""Outhouse of Conflict,"" part of the Black Rock Blind Tiger that went to Burning Flipside 2016.


The Team

The Black Rock Blind Tiger is based out of Austin, Texas and
led by veteran Burning Man and Burning Flipside attendee Tiffaney Benson.  The team includes a 20+ person crew of artists,
mixologists, builders, designers, and do’ers. 
For more about our team, see our Team Bios page:  http://www.blackrockblindtiger.com/artist-and-team.html

Funding

We’re raising funds to transform our vintage Silver Streak
trailer into a literal work of art.  To
date we have raised $5,000 through local fundraisers, but we have about $10,000
remaining to meet our goal.  Our major
expenses include building supplies, transportation, décor, gadgets, lighting, insurance, and tools.  For a
breakdown of our budget by category, see our Funding page:  http://www.blackrockblindtiger.com/funding.html
The Black Rock Blind Tiger is a volunteer-led project
supported entirely by our team members, fundraiser attendees, and Indiegogo
campaign backers.  Your support of our
campaign allows us to turn our dream of a community speakeasy on the playa into
a reality.  We have already acquired our
trailer and construction is currently underway!

<h3>The Bucky Ball Pit</h3>
<p>Buckminster Fuller was a da Vinci of the 20th century - a poet, an engineer, a futurist, a polymath. He spent his life discovering and utilizing natures coordinate system in order to make the world work for 100% of humanity. He found that the closest packing of spheres (or balls, if you will) revealed the underlying structure of the universe, upon which 3.8 billion years of life on earth had designed itself.</p>
<p><br/>The Bucky Ball Pit is inspired by the life and work of Buckminster Fuller who peeled back the layers of the reality he was born into and looked at it from a fresh perspective. You will literally crawl inside his mind made of a geodesic dome, a bounce house and a ball pit, seeing the world as he saw it, but most importantly you will be inspired to do your own thinking. </p>
<p>There will be many avenues for learning about Bucky in the ball pit. We are designing a custom VR experience that will guide you through Bucky's understanding of nature's coordinate system. We will be screening his 42-hour long lecture titled ""Everything I Know"" layered with ambient music. There will be lectures both planned and impromptu, books, posters, models and much much more. </p>
<p>We are also building The Bucky Neurological Translator by which Buckminster Fuller explanation and insight is absorbed by an individual.  The individual's autonomic nervous system is influenced by the feelings associated with this absorbed data.  A basis physiological expression associated with both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system is then expressed into the Bucky ball volume.  Those meandering through the volume feel a auditory and tactile pressure reflective of this nervous system state.  A novel and fundamental communication is enabled to connect abstract Bucky thoughts with core physiological state. </p>
<p>This project will be brought back to the playa adjacent (formally known as the default world) after burning man and set up at events, conferences, festivals, city parks, and many other venues. We're committed to growing this project, enhancing the VR experience and offering it to as many people as possible. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Imagine This</h3>
<p>You are a dusty hot mess in the best kind of way. The conditions for epiphany are riper than that peach rolling around at the bottom of your backpack. You’re steeped in the experiment-in-community that is burning man, the gifting economy keeps delivering serendipity to you in shovel fulls, the harsh climate is testing your limits, you’re facing your triggers, un-imprinting past traumas, surrounded by smiling authentic faces, and perhaps have invited entheogens into the mix. Mini-epiphanies and even the larger kind are waiting with baited breath to thrill your mind, body, and soul. You and 70 thousand others are exploring the life’s work of a great renaissance man, Da Vinci, a man inspired by nature’s coordinate system, a man so creative that some of his designs and models still have not been built.</p> <p>Then a friend pulls you into a ball pit. You think, hey this is a nice fun comfy respite from it all. Then you realize it’s themed Buckminster Fuller, the Da Vinci of the 20th century, a polymath- a futurist, poet, writer, architect, inventor, and as most burners are aware- the inventor of the geodesic dome! You look around at the dome that is covering the ball pit and see quotes of his, models of his explorations in geometry, and a gorgeous geometric art installation on the ceiling behind it all. You see triangles, hexagons, and spheres everywhere.</p> <p>Then a friendly host hands you a Virtual Reality headset and asks: “would you like to become re-enchanted with the fundamental coordinate system of the universe? You slide it on and immerse yourself in an exploration in nature’s coordinate system. You learn about simple shapes like tetrahedrons and more complex ones like the vector equilibrium. You learn the definition of <i>Synergetics: the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components, including humanity's role as both participant and observer. </i>You are inside an experience that has been designed to reorient your fundamental understanding of the universe. You have an epiphany: Universe is an abstraction,  but when you understand how it works you can become an active participant instead of a passive observer. Woah.</p> <p>If you are there at the right time you’ll also be set up with bio sensor that will take your heart-rate, and visualize it on the dome above you.</p> <p>If you are there between 5-7 you will also participate in a Geometry of Thinking workshop . You’ll make your own models to take home and tools for teaching others about spheres, nanotech, biomimicry and how the universe works.</p>

WHAT WOULD I DO?"" -R. Buckminster Fuller</i></h2></div>","The Bucky Ball Pit
Buckminster Fuller was a da Vinci of the 20th century - a poet, an engineer, a futurist, a polymath. He spent his life discovering and utilizing natures coordinate system in order to make the world work for 100% of humanity. He found that the closest packing of spheres (or balls, if you will) revealed the underlying structure of the universe, upon which 3.8 billion years of life on earth had designed itself.
The Bucky Ball Pit is inspired by the life and work of Buckminster Fuller who peeled back the layers of the reality he was born into and looked at it from a fresh perspective. You will literally crawl inside his mind made of a geodesic dome, a bounce house and a ball pit, seeing the world as he saw it, but most importantly you will be inspired to do your own thinking. 
There will be many avenues for learning about Bucky in the ball pit. We are designing a custom VR experience that will guide you through Bucky's understanding of nature's coordinate system. We will be screening his 42-hour long lecture titled ""Everything I Know"" layered with ambient music. There will be lectures both planned and impromptu, books, posters, models and much much more. 
We are also building The Bucky Neurological Translator by which Buckminster Fuller explanation and insight is absorbed by an individual.  The individual's autonomic nervous system is influenced by the feelings associated with this absorbed data.  A basis physiological expression associated with both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system is then expressed into the Bucky ball volume.  Those meandering through the volume feel a auditory and tactile pressure reflective of this nervous system state.  A novel and fundamental communication is enabled to connect abstract Bucky thoughts with core physiological state. 
This project will be brought back to the playa adjacent (formally known as the default world) after burning man and set up at events, conferences, festivals, city parks, and many other venues. We're committed to growing this project, enhancing the VR experience and offering it to as many people as possible. 
 
Imagine This
You are a dusty hot mess in the best kind of way. The conditions for epiphany are riper than that peach rolling around at the bottom of your backpack. You’re steeped in the experiment-in-community that is burning man, the gifting economy keeps delivering serendipity to you in shovel fulls, the harsh climate is testing your limits, you’re facing your triggers, un-imprinting past traumas, surrounded by smiling authentic faces, and perhaps have invited entheogens into the mix. Mini-epiphanies and even the larger kind are waiting with baited breath to thrill your mind, body, and soul. You and 70 thousand others are exploring the life’s work of a great renaissance man, Da Vinci, a man inspired by nature’s coordinate system, a man so creative that some of his designs and models still have not been built. Then a friend pulls you into a ball pit. You think, hey this is a nice fun comfy respite from it all. Then you realize it’s themed Buckminster Fuller, the Da Vinci of the 20th century, a polymath- a futurist, poet, writer, architect, inventor, and as most burners are aware- the inventor of the geodesic dome! You look around at the dome that is covering the ball pit and see quotes of his, models of his explorations in geometry, and a gorgeous geometric art installation on the ceiling behind it all. You see triangles, hexagons, and spheres everywhere. Then a friendly host hands you a Virtual Reality headset and asks: “would you like to become re-enchanted with the fundamental coordinate system of the universe? You slide it on and immerse yourself in an exploration in nature’s coordinate system. You learn about simple shapes like tetrahedrons and more complex ones like the vector equilibrium. You learn the definition of Synergetics: the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components, including humanity's role as both participant and observer. You are inside an experience that has been designed to reorient your fundamental understanding of the universe. You have an epiphany: Universe is an abstraction,  but when you understand how it works you can become an active participant instead of a passive observer. Woah. If you are there at the right time you’ll also be set up with bio sensor that will take your heart-rate, and visualize it on the dome above you. If you are there between 5-7 you will also participate in a Geometry of Thinking workshop . You’ll make your own models to take home and tools for teaching others about spheres, nanotech, biomimicry and how the universe works.
 

What We Need & What You Get
Here is what we need monies for:

<h3>Hey everyone, I'm Nina Browwn, a R&amp;B/Pop recording artist based in Toronto, Canada looking to raise funds for some new projects to further my music career.</h3>
<p>My goal with this campaign is to raise enough funds to be able to record more music, help my band out as well who have been working so hard with me at rehearsals to prepare for shows and really just be able to impact more people with music. </p>
<p>With your support, I truly feel that I will be able to deliver an outstanding product that will appeal to all ages and types of people. Nothing makes me happier than when someone tells me how my music touched them and resonated with them because they had been through similar situations as the topics of my songs. By reaching out and supporting me, you'll be apart of something great that I am truly humbled about and proud of! I won't disappoint, I can promise you that! </p>
</div><div>
<p>My goal with the funds raised is to put them towards another EP project which will contain 5-6 new songs that really touch on some very personal topics and situations I have been through in my life and thanks to music, I was able to overcome them and move forward.</p>
<p>The funds will also be used to promote my project once completed, to put on shows locally, build my brand through exposure and also help the community through music. </p>
<p>By contributing to my campaign, you can be sure that I intend to send out free CDs signed by me to each of you, I intend to get Nina Browwn swag for you guys such as merchandise. But most importantly, I want to sing for you guys! So... if you guys need someone to perform for any events for you locally in Toronto, I'm your girl! I want to have fun with you guys, I want you to enjoy yourselves with me and really just have a great time! </p>
<p>Every little bit helps! Achieving the goal of $15,000 is a tall order and definitely NO easy task but I believe it's doable. Even if we don't make it to that dollar amount, whatever is raised will be going first into making the music and then into showing it off to the world!</p>
</div><div>
<p>My last project has been getting a lot of attention through Social Media and music platforms. On SoundCloud, I have over 600,000 plays of my songs and have been getting a lot of positive feedback from the Canadian market as well as in LA where I have been trying to breakthrough as well. I don't mind sleepless nights if it means that the end goal will be achieved!</p>
<p>I can say that with every dollar of support, it only makes me more hungry and eager to create and make all of my supporters and fans proud of what I am doing. It humbles me to know that people genuinely care about other people and those who have taken a leap of faith to follow their dreams! We can make it happen together, this I know in my heart! </p>
<p>I would love to reach as many people as possible and with your help by spreading the word, this will be possible. Let your friends, family, coworkers know that they can be apart of something special and powerful. I genuinely believe that we all have a passion for music somewhere inside of us and it affects us all in different ways. </p>
</div><div><p>I know it won't be easy and my journey is far from over, with lots of challenges ahead of me but I feel like I have been preparing for this my whole life and feel like there is no time like the present to make it happen. I am so blessed to already have an amazing following of people who love and support me and what I do so I can't wait to see what's all this has in store for me next. I plan to pay if forward and make sure that I do all I can to help others who also want to fight and not give up on their dreams.</p></div></div>","Hey everyone, I'm Nina Browwn, a R&B/Pop recording artist based in Toronto, Canada looking to raise funds for some new projects to further my music career.

<p><span style=""line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">Why the Liberace Foundation is a great investment, and how we feel we've earned it</span><br/></p>
<p>WHAT EXACTLY IS THE MONEY FOR?</p>
<p>We are NOT asking you for money to pay ourselves.  We are NOT seeking funds to spend in salaries or overhead.  These funds will be invested directly in development of the exhibit, completed at deep discounts, due in part to the donation of significant amounts of time by our renowned designers, and the donations of many thousands of dollars in rent by the owner of Thriller Villa.  Exhibiting here will not only cut our expenses by eliminating storage rent, it will also provide a spectacular and private venue for VIP supporters, brand licensees, Foundation members and other supporters to see the collection in all its glory, in private visits.  The intention is to bring about more public exhibitions by inviting key decision makers and financial supporters of the Foundation to experience the Collection first hand.  Donations paid by viewers will also support this initiative.</p>
<p>WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THE FOUNDATION?</p>
<p>Since February 2014, the Liberace Foundation has emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy virtually debt free, while re-structuring its business model to reduce its overhead by over $250,000 annually, to an all-time low of under $50,000 per year.  At the same time, we have increased our income by over $120,000 through sponsored exhibits and brand licensing.  While we were at it, we have exploded our online and interactive presence, and flooded across the pages of the national press.</p>
<p>Now, the Foundation is in the enviable position of having</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>NO RENT - This venue will not cost us any rent whatsoever, and will house the bulk of the Liberace Museum Collection</li>
<li>NO SALARIES - Our Board is now unpaid, and our staff is hourly</li>
<li>NO DEBT - We have eliminated virtually all long-term debt</li>
<li>GREATER EXPERTISE - Rather than one or two curators on staff, we now three trained archivists who are recent graduates of UNLV, plus a business graduate, all augmented by a stable of world-renowned curators, archivists, historians and veterans of Liberace's own show, serving as volunteers and directing exhibits, as members of our <a href=""http://liberace.org/about/advisory-board/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Advisory Board</a>
</li>
<li>OPTIMUM LOCATION - The new exhibit is scheduled to occupy the space for the next year, where it will enjoy perfect temperature conditions and the best in security, while providing a private environment for high-profile or celebrity supporters to visit without concern.</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://liberace.org/liberace-museum-collection/exhibits/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">NEW PRODUCTIONS</a> AND <a href=""http://liberace.org/liberace-brand-licensing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BRAND LICENSING</a> - The venue allows the perfect opportunity to invite show production and brand licensing partners to continue our expansions in those and other markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS MODEL?</p>
<p>Our business model is to continue to utlize the Liberace Collections and brand licensing to generate all operating income.  We will seek funds from donors only for our scholarship endowment fund (never to be spent on overhead or expenses), and for specific, defined projects such as this.  In short, this Foundation has tremendous earning power which your contribution will help us to permanently establish for the benefit of students of the performing and creative arts. Everything is in place.  Its your turn to take the stage.</p>
<p>With your help, we will remain debt free.  The income generated by donations will continue the <a href=""http://liberace.org/2015/01/27/liberace-foundation-grants-and-scholarships-report-1981-2011/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>scholarships and grants program</a> which have placed over $6 million in the hands of students of the performing and creative arts, at over 100 universities, over the past 30 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>Take a look at our video which includes a peek at the level of care provided by the archivists of the Liberace Museum Collection</li>
<li>The perks we have arranged are completely unique.  They include the last runs of items never again to be licensed or sold by the Foundation or museum gift shops.  These are truly collectors items.  Substantial donors will also enjoy naming opportunities for certain exhibit rooms during this exhibition, and ability to utilize Thriller Villa for your own events.  We have put significant thought and effort into the perks to make them of  sort that money alone truly cannot buy.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Your Impact Assured</h3>
<p>Donations and event sales at this exhibit will support the Foundation and its missions as defined by Liberace himself.  Your generosity secures our existing earning power so that it can provide scholarships, grants and performance venues for students of the creative and performing arts.  </p>
<p>Remember:</p>

</div></div>","The Liberace Museum Collection is on the moveElton John, Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga.  The top recording artists of the past 40 years credit Liberace as inspiration, catalyst,  Mr. Showmanship.  His name is mentioned over 3 million times on the internet.  ""Liberace"" is named in the lyrics of well over 1,000 songs spanning 60 years, across all genres. The Foundation started by Liberace himself in 1976 closed its famed museum five years ago, citing top-heavy expenses  and an outdated and outmoded facility.  In the past two years, new leadership has taken over and brought the Liberace brand back to a position of prominence in society and pop culture.The Liberace Museum Collection has contributed to film, stage and other museum productions with unprecedented success.  A multi-million dollar Liberace show in hologram, licensed by the Liberace Foundation and in production, has been in the national press
A massive restructuring since 2013 put the organization on much more solid financial and policy footing.  In the mean time, the Liberace Museum Collection has grown larger by more acquisitions of artifacts, and is now so vast it has never been seen at any one location, ever.

A MAJOR PRIVATE LIBERACE EXHIBIT
Now, a major donor has contributed an extraordinary facility to store much of the Liberace Museum Collection, and to house an exhibit more elaborate than any ever previously offered.   It will include the most famous stage costumes, jewelry, pianos of both the stage and rare antique types, mansion furnishings, fine art, fine china, crystal, chandeliers, candelabras, historic original documents, awards, correspondence, photos and more, all orchestrated by Liberace Foundation archivists in a private tour de force of the 6-decade career of Liberace. Special invited guests of the Liberace Foundation, including Foundation members, exhibit venue owners, brand licensee candidates, and contributors to this campaign will be invited by the property owner to tour the exhibit, in support of the Foundation. The exhibit will not be open to the general public.

THE FRIEND YOU MAY NOT KNOW

As were many other entertainers, Michael Jackson was a friend of Liberace's.  The influence of the King of Bling on the King of Pop is apparent in the costuming and showmanship techniques of Michael Jackson beginning in the late 1980's.  This will be apparent in the photos from the era, within the exhibit.

THE VENUE
Now, the most extraordinary of Liberace Museum Collection exhibits is being constructed in the massive, mysterious Subterranean Artists Vault at Thriller Villa, the former Las Vegas home of Michael Jackson.  This is the underground keep where Jackson kept his legendary billion-dollar art collection, until his death in 2009.




Why the Liberace Foundation is a great investment, and how we feel we've earned it
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE MONEY FOR?
We are NOT asking you for money to pay ourselves.  We are NOT seeking funds to spend in salaries or overhead.  These funds will be invested directly in development of the exhibit, completed at deep discounts, due in part to the donation of significant amounts of time by our renowned designers, and the donations of many thousands of dollars in rent by the owner of Thriller Villa.  Exhibiting here will not only cut our expenses by eliminating storage rent, it will also provide a spectacular and private venue for VIP supporters, brand licensees, Foundation members and other supporters to see the collection in all its glory, in private visits.  The intention is to bring about more public exhibitions by inviting key decision makers and financial supporters of the Foundation to experience the Collection first hand.  Donations paid by viewers will also support this initiative.
WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF THE FOUNDATION?
Since February 2014, the Liberace Foundation has emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy virtually debt free, while re-structuring its business model to reduce its overhead by over $250,000 annually, to an all-time low of under $50,000 per year.  At the same time, we have increased our income by over $120,000 through sponsored exhibits and brand licensing.  While we were at it, we have exploded our online and interactive presence, and flooded across the pages of the national press.
Now, the Foundation is in the enviable position of having


NO RENT - This venue will not cost us any rent whatsoever, and will house the bulk of the Liberace Museum Collection
NO SALARIES - Our Board is now unpaid, and our staff is hourly
NO DEBT - We have eliminated virtually all long-term debt
GREATER EXPERTISE - Rather than one or two curators on staff, we now three trained archivists who are recent graduates of UNLV, plus a business graduate, all augmented by a stable of world-renowned curators, archivists, historians and veterans of Liberace's own show, serving as volunteers and directing exhibits, as members of our Advisory Board

OPTIMUM LOCATION - The new exhibit is scheduled to occupy the space for the next year, where it will enjoy perfect temperature conditions and the best in security, while providing a private environment for high-profile or celebrity supporters to visit without concern.

NEW PRODUCTIONS AND BRAND LICENSING - The venue allows the perfect opportunity to invite show production and brand licensing partners to continue our expansions in those and other markets.

WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS MODEL?
Our business model is to continue to utlize the Liberace Collections and brand licensing to generate all operating income.  We will seek funds from donors only for our scholarship endowment fund (never to be spent on overhead or expenses), and for specific, defined projects such as this.  In short, this Foundation has tremendous earning power which your contribution will help us to permanently establish for the benefit of students of the performing and creative arts. Everything is in place.  Its your turn to take the stage.
With your help, we will remain debt free.  The income generated by donations will continue the scholarships and grants program which have placed over $6 million in the hands of students of the performing and creative arts, at over 100 universities, over the past 30 years.

Take a look at our video which includes a peek at the level of care provided by the archivists of the Liberace Museum Collection
The perks we have arranged are completely unique.  They include the last runs of items never again to be licensed or sold by the Foundation or museum gift shops.  These are truly collectors items.  Substantial donors will also enjoy naming opportunities for certain exhibit rooms during this exhibition, and ability to utilize Thriller Villa for your own events.  We have put significant thought and effort into the perks to make them of  sort that money alone truly cannot buy.




Your Impact Assured
Donations and event sales at this exhibit will support the Foundation and its missions as defined by Liberace himself.  Your generosity secures our existing earning power so that it can provide scholarships, grants and performance venues for students of the creative and performing arts.  
Remember:

We are a virtually debt-free foundation with no salaried employees and no rent overhead at this, our largest location
Funds raised will not be spent on overhead such as rent or salaries

<p>Drawing is something that's gotten me through a lot of things in life and it's something I enjoy more than breathing because it allows me to not only make other people happy, but it also makes me happy that people can appreciate something of mine that they don't need to.

</div></div>","Purpose:
Put on a show for 500 Black male teens during Black history month. Take 25 of them to be mentored by ""Egypt"" for an entire summer. Give them a chance to have a role model. Inspire them to be the prototype, not the stereotype. 








































Black Men: Naked
Truth One-man Show & Film
When President Obama asked the community to educate Black men in his ""My Brother's Keeper Campaign"", this show was created. 
One man and seven
characters illustrate healing truths many Black men want to say but can't or
won't articulate. Why won't they? If they did, society has already considered a
man who speaks openly about his troubles as, ""weak"",
""effeminate"" or ""soft."" From HIV testing, colon cancer screening to the affects  and low expectations of being a fatherless child, all are things men are taught to fight alone. 
Many Black men
are exhausted from defending stereotypes many don’t resemble or share. The
world must be tired of the repetitive and false negative images of Black
men. This show is not only debunking stereotypes but also disclosing an untold
experience many live daily. 
From World Famous
Apollo Theatre,  a TED talk, BET's 106 & Park to sharing stages with John Legend and
Alicia Keys, Devin T. Robinson X ""Egypt"" has made his brand of acting
a powerful tool to express social issues. 







(Egypt speaking on a panel with Arthur Wylie, John Legend, Dr. Del Rosario and Marc. Williams)

Contributing to this message allows for an untold story to finally be told. Your support creates history by giving an opportunity for a marginalized group of 500 Black youth to hear another side of their journey.                                                  (""Egypt"" speaking at TEDx PSUT)

What We Need!With 20,000$ we
can put on a dynamic production, have it professionally filmed (very costly),
send it to film festivals and have screenings at high schools to present this message.
A bulk of the money will be allocated to marketing. With events pertaining to
education, marketing is one area most organizations can't or fail to invest in
properly. The remaining dollars will go to:




Renting a venue for 3 dates.
Production of promotional commercials.
Radio commercials 
Hiring a director and production company to film the live event.
The filming of the event.
Booking up and coming national artists to open up the event, (which will help build attendance) 
Awards to local young Black artists who reflect the image of positive men. 
Transportation, events & meeting space for mentoring 25 youth for 90 days

What You Get!
From
personalized, ""Thank You"" videos, autographed posters, lunch
with ""Egypt"" to having your business showcased to 5,000 Facebook
friends, the perks are fun and worthy of your support! For the top contributors,
Egypt will write, perform and produce a 3-minute video of their submitted LIFE
STORY! 
What Happens If We
Don’t Meet Funding?
If we don't reach
our goal...THE SHOW MUST GO ON! We will put on a smaller show. Scaled to our
funds, inspire the community and use a virtual approach to mentoring youth! 
The Impact!
"" Gangs attract recruits by making them feel good for doing bad. What if we as a community made young men feel good for being good? The result would be a new gang. Call it, ""Change."" -Egypt
When we applaud misbehavior but are apathetic to the opposite, we indirectly encourage negativity. There are many young men who would have stayed on the correct path if they would have seen a show like this. If they would have realized there was hope, happiness or honor in doing the right things...maybe they would.
Many Black men
have ""made it"" but their stories aren't told. The negative images of
thugs, drug dealers or convicts own visual real estate on TV and computer screens. Therefore, they own mental real estate in the minds of children and many. 
What
if they heard the stories of the men who were dealt horrible cards but still
decided, ""I will not be a victim of my circumstance or a statistic because of
it.""? What if that was an undeniable message which echoed across the
world? The result would be a sigh of relief and a jolt of happiness as many would
finally receive an applause for ""doing right"" instead of being
grouped into a small box of those who care to do wrong or nothing at all. This
is that message. 
Let's make these 7 stories the new normal. If we do...we will start to see more young and older men doing the right things because of your support, your attendance and your applause. 
                  (Egypt performing at Florida Memorial University)

Why Does Egypt Care
and Is He Qualified?Despite losing
his mother at 12, having his father abandon him a week later then entering
college as an orphan, Egypt is a prime example of taking the cards you're dealt
and still being in the game. He's created
several successful one-man shows from, *""God, Me...HIV?"", *""From
Property To President"" and *""God Didn't Give Me HIV"" all
educating the masses about social issues.                     *(www.HIVShow.com and www.PropertyToPresident.com)

                                         Risks & Challenges


It's easy to have
a vision, a goal many people support and believe in. What's difficult is being
a voice for a marginalized body of people who may believe no one cares about
their struggle. We're so used to being ignored, hearing about something like this may seem more fiction than fact. Therefore, marketing will be the key (Bulk of budget) to ensuring a successful event.
Without a heavy media campaign, this may become just another ignored but needed
""positive"" production.
Since 2003,
""Egypt"" has put on successful one-man shows all across the world.
From Johannesburg, South Africa to South Florida. On multiple occasions,
300-500 people were in attendance to witness a message about social issues. No matter the ethnicity or subject, if you are willing to take a leap of faith and risk losing it all for a cause, success is your only option. 
This is his message. Give people a reason to come out. Let them know it's not a
""those people over there"" issue but a ""My"" issue. Over 11
years of making the connection and Egypt isn't giving up now.

<p>Ociciwan Contemporary Art Centre is a new Indigenous run exhibition and community space in ᐊᒥᐢᑿᒋᐩ ᐚᐢᑲᐦᐃᑲᐣ amiskwacîwâskahikan (Edmonton, Alberta.) Ociciwan supports the work of Indigenous contemporary artists and designers, and engages in contemporary critical dialogue.

<p>Ociciwan Contemporary Art Centre is a project that began with the Ociciwan Collective. Founded in 2015, Ociciwan Collective Core members originally formed the collective under the awareness that Edmonton is in need of more support for Indigenous contemporary artists, curators, designers, educators, and culture workers; as well as, the dialogue, criticality, and vision associated with this practice. Ociciwan partnered with local arts organizations, such as Latitude 53 Contemporary Visual Culture, dc3 Art Projects, the Art Gallery of Alberta, Maggie and John Mitchell Art Gallery and the Francis Winspear Centre for Music, to support and promote innovative and experimental Indigenous contemporary arts practices. This way of fostering exhibitions and creative projects has allowed us to build and engage with a broader audience. However, it has always been Ociciwan’s goal to open a centre and to operate in a permanent location within Edmonton, as a way to fulfill the mandate that was set forth at Ociciwan’s conception.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>OCICIWAN CONTEMPORARY ART CENTRE</h3>
<p>The goal of Ociciwan Contemporary Art Centre is to present Indigenous contemporary art and creative practices within our city,  and to serve as a developing model for supporting and developing Indigenous contemporary artist-centred galleries and cultural spaces. This art centre will allow the city to fully engage in its relationship to Indigenous contemporary art.</p>
<p>The Centre will remain collective-run with a group of Core Members, advising and co-curating exhibitions alongside Director Becca Taylor, rather than operating as a traditional artist-run centre. Current members of the Ociciwan Collective include Halie Finney, Alberta Rose W./Ingniq, Tiffany Shaw-Collinge, Erin Sutherland, and Kristy Trinier. Becca is joined by two staff members at the Centre: Michelle Campos Castillo (Project Coordinator) and Tracy Bradley (Community Coordinator). </p>
<p>Ociciwan Centre presents four exhibitions or creative projects annually, with additional community-based programming relating to our exhibitions program. The Collective will strives to support, value and foster contemporary Indigenous art practices, while continuing to engage and partner with the local Edmonton community.</p>
<p>In September, Ociciwan Contemporary Art Centre will open our doors to the public with an inaugural exhibition, “amiskwacîwâskahikan,” featuring artworks by eight artists who reside in, or hold a strong connection to, amiskwacîwâskahikan (Edmonton), Alberta.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>As an artist, my work blurs the boundary between nature and consumer culture. The Arctic is an intersection of these two things because it is ground zero for climate change, warming faster than anywhere else on the planet. Even more shocking, this remote area is seeing an influx of plastics carried north by currents.</p>
<p>My work is heavily influenced by both climate change and plastic, so I am compelled to explore this region. I intend to bring what I gain back to my work, my college students, and my community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>I will be a participant in the <a href=""http://thearcticcircle.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Arctic Circle</a> residency program. Aside from absorbing the beauty of this exquisite landscape, I will do research for two simultaneous projects. One involves Emiliania Huxlyei, a microscopic coccolithophore (see image below) moving north due to warmer temps. The other involves marine plastic that has literally been carried to the ends of the Earth via the Thermohaline current. </p>
<p>In preparation for my journey, I have met with scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), The University of Colorado, Bigelow Labs (Michigan), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>
<p>On the trip, I plan to write, photograph, film and record. I will scout and collect samples of plastics from the icy shores and water, as well as samples that may contain EHux. I am also hoping to meet with scientists at a few labs in Svalbard (NyAlesund and Longyearbyen).</p>
<p><u>I firmly believe that art is a crucial part of the conversation on climate change.</u> By contributing to this project, you are connecting me directly to scientists and artists who are working diligently to help ameliorate these issues, and who are inspired by the Arctic. You are also placing me in a uniquely stunning landscape where art and science intersect.</p>

<p>For your contributions, I am offering art prints, handmade jellyfish pendants, and even a few unique resin sculptures and paintings at a discounted price!</p>
<p>I have been funding this trip ahead of time (privately and through donations), so any money collected will offset the overall costs of this trip -- even if I do not reach my goal.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you are investing in my education, my cross-disciplinary collaboration, and the hands-on field research that informs my work. In this trip, nature and culture once again overlap; plastic is my symbolic metaphor for humanity's manic state, and a tiny EHux phytoplankton represents the briliance and deep history of our planet. </p>
<p>In the past I have created works with plastic materials to point out the magnitude of our choices. The 3.2 tons of black recycled HDPE pellets in <a href=""https://vimeo.com/246917916"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>Omega</strong></u></a> showed how one American's annual average plastic bottle purchases added to the overall global consumption. Projects like <a href=""http://reganrosburg.com/installation/2016/2/8/d0sogmwkn85hd35t1l5f2h2wpzoefn"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>The Relentless Memorial</strong></u></a> provided a place to contemplate and mourn our planetary losses. </p>
<p>My interests have expanded beyond my own work to include others. I have done this by inviting artists to comment on aspects of EcoPsychology in curated exhibitions like<a href=""https://axismundiartistsrespond.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <strong><u>Axis Mundi</u></strong></a>, by participating in conferences like the <u><strong><a href=""https://www.thinkerslodgehistories.com/climate-change-2017-thinkers-lodge.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Thinker's Lodge</a></strong></u> in Nova Scotia, and by co-creating the  <u><strong><a href=""https://www.cayoresidency.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cayo</a></strong></u> art/science residency in Eleuthera so that more artists may learn from each other.</p>
<p>I promise you this: your contribution will spawn large, thoughtful projects like these, dedicated to a careful consideration of our place in the world and resulting in evocative, knowledgeable, honest artwork about what is at stake.</p>

<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<p>Two years ago we entered the program as strangers. Together we've been through countless late nights, tough critiques, caffeinated drinks, etc. These experiences created an indelible bond between us. Now we are one family, each with a story to tell. This two-day show will exhibit our best works and reveal to you our individual processes. This show marks a point where we wave goodbye to our time together as students and welcome the uncertain future with open arms. </p>

<h3>Our Goal:</h3>
<p><i>Et Cetera</i> is entirely self-funded by the 25 students in our class. We’ve knocked on doors, hawked our wares, and cobbled our show together by our bootstraps. (But mostly, we emptied our pockets.) We now look to you, our beloved family, friends, and supporters for a little extra help in making the show everything we hope and dream it to be. Our goal is to raise a fraction of what we've paid out of our pockets. Every penny will go directly toward venue costs, rental fees, set up, print production, etc. A donation of any size will help us in furthering our goals for the show. As a token of our appreciation, every donor will receive an official <i>Et Cetera</i> sticker, pin, and personalized note.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate you and thank you for your support. We hope to see you at our show December 14–15 so we can thank you in person!</p>

<p>We are Stephanie + Kekeli, the founders and editors of a new type of publishing imprint called <strong>The Object Press</strong>.</p>
<p>Kekeli Sumah is an artist and designer currently pursing a Masters in Architecture at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). He also holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts and a Bachelor of Arts in Visual and Critical Studies from SAIC.</p>
<p>Stephanie Lin-Sumah is a painter and artist exploring the intersecting dynamics of race, culture and identity in her work. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Arts Studio from the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) and graduated from SAIC with a Masters of Art in Art Therapy. She currently works at SAIC.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This past November we were notified that our project idea: The Object Press would be included in a student exhibition organized by Ann Lui (faculty at SAIC and co-curator of the US Pavilion at the 2018 Venice Architecture Biennale) and Iker Gil—an associate curator. This exhibition is the first of it's kind in the history of the Venice Architecture Biennale and we're really excited to seize this opportunity to show alongside leading thinkers and practitioners in the fields of art, architecture and culture.</p>
<p>Our first issue as publishers: <i>Home/Lands</i>, will curate research artifacts from 10 local and international artists and designers, whose work addresses questions of citizenship and belonging through lenses of origins, personal narratives, geographies and physical acts of place-making.</p>
<p>Your contributions to this campaign will not only launch The Object Press by getting Stephanie + Kekeli to Venice, but more importantly, it will cement creative research in all forms as a legitimate line of critique and inquiry capable of addressing the issues of our times.</p>

<p>As makers, we've already started prototyping box designs and layouts for the 10 contributors we are publishing. We've put a lot of work into seeking advice from curators, designers and fabricators on how best to build and support the contents of the box.

<p>Since the student exhibition is organized as an SAIC study trip, Kekeli will be traveling with his classmates first and Stephanie will be joining him later.

<h3>The Impact, The Risk, The Challenge</h3>
<p>The Object Press is an answer to a need we identified when it comes to understanding the research and process of creative people; and we're poised to make a positive impact. Our biggest challenge will come from the The Object Press being such a novel idea—every step leads us into uncharted territory. Fortunately, we're plugged into a community of artists, designers, curators, mentors, business leaders and entrepreneurs who are willing to support our goals and visions along the way.</p>

</div></div>","We are Stephanie + Kekeli, the founders and editors of a new type of publishing imprint called The Object Press.
Kekeli Sumah is an artist and designer currently pursing a Masters in Architecture at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC). He also holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts and a Bachelor of Arts in Visual and Critical Studies from SAIC.
Stephanie Lin-Sumah is a painter and artist exploring the intersecting dynamics of race, culture and identity in her work. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Arts Studio from the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) and graduated from SAIC with a Masters of Art in Art Therapy. She currently works at SAIC.
 
Short Summary
This past November we were notified that our project idea: The Object Press would be included in a student exhibition organized by Ann Lui (faculty at SAIC and co-curator of the US Pavilion at the 2018 Venice Architecture Biennale) and Iker Gil—an associate curator. This exhibition is the first of it's kind in the history of the Venice Architecture Biennale and we're really excited to seize this opportunity to show alongside leading thinkers and practitioners in the fields of art, architecture and culture.
Our first issue as publishers: Home/Lands, will curate research artifacts from 10 local and international artists and designers, whose work addresses questions of citizenship and belonging through lenses of origins, personal narratives, geographies and physical acts of place-making.
Your contributions to this campaign will not only launch The Object Press by getting Stephanie + Kekeli to Venice, but more importantly, it will cement creative research in all forms as a legitimate line of critique and inquiry capable of addressing the issues of our times.
 

What We Need & What You Get

As makers, we've already started prototyping box designs and layouts for the 10 contributors we are publishing. We've put a lot of work into seeking advice from curators, designers and fabricators on how best to build and support the contents of the box. Now we need materials, special equipment and supplies to complete the box.
Since the student exhibition is organized as an SAIC study trip, Kekeli will be traveling with his classmates first and Stephanie will be joining him later. The $5,000 cost of school tuition and trip program fee will be covered by family contributions. But we will need help with traveling and living expenses. Here is the break down of anticipated costs:

Research + Development (design testing for the box): $200

Material Costs (wood, acrylic, display equipment, etc): $500

Mailing Costs (receiving and shipping contributor work local + international): $130

Shipping Costs (taking the box to Venice and back): $120

Round Trip Flight from Chicago to Venice (for two): $1700

Room + Board (for two): $2100

On-the-ground/canal Travel in Venice & Italy (ferry, public transit, rental car, gas): $620

Miscellaneous + Incidental Costs: $250

Indiegogo Fee Estimate: $280


Total Campaign Funding Sought: $5,900

<h3>Let's Take a Trip...</h3>
<p>Let's Take A Trip is an 108 psychedelic oracle deck based off personal trip experiences with magic mushrooms, LSD, &amp; cannabis. She is meant to be a full immersive experience through all the senses, sight, sound, touch, taste, &amp; our sixth senses of course. Let's Take A Trip was born shortly after experiencing an intense magic mushroom trip, opening Rainbow Liz in unexpected ways. A Meaningful Dream has always wanted to create an oracle deck, but the idea never came for the theme until Penis Envy entered our life. The deck came through as a major download, &amp; I received countless signs from the Universe that this NEEDED to happen. Let's Take A Trip is truly unique, as its very ""trippy &amp; abstract"" in nature &amp; strongly embraces psychedelics &amp; their sacred medicine they offer the cosmic consciousness. No deck has been created purely like this before.</p>

<h3>The Call...</h3>
<p>A Meaningful Dream is on the path to awaken consciousness on a cosmic level. When Rainbow Liz attended the very first Entheofest in Ann Arbor, Michigan, she received another call. Her ancestors were singing out to her, begging her to expand this offering beyond what was already created. To continue standing up for nature &amp; her magic she offers. To be a protector &amp; educator of Mother Earth. Which is why $11 per deck will be donated to Decriminalize Nature Michigan. To help make these plants legal, allow them to be more accessible to our community, &amp; to the stop the unnecessary war on plants. So far, Decriminalize Nature Michigan has successfully decriminalize magic mushrooms in Ann Arbor, &amp; Hazel Park, Michigan.

These islands (atolls) are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia.

He finds that exciting when<strong> the real distances of things being measured</strong> is not necessarily reflected scientifically or lawfully especially when it is influenced by desires, beliefs &amp; national needs. He thinks about what one did when one was a child. One would measure things around them with their outstretched fingers: the first act of almost pure measuring. That’s when he made the first sculpture in the first phase of Time Boomerang. He casted his hand, fingers fully outstretched in his childhood measuring gesture, in metal. When it was completed, he cut out the five fingertips, and moved them away from the hand, symbolically extending his ability to measure (or mark new territories).

In addition, he wishes to feel the energy that moves huge amount of world commerce in the expansive blue of the Pacific Ocean.  Instead of jet-lag, he will probably experience boat-lag when reaching America.   The type of cargo ship artist UuDam will take to come to Los Angeles (a 30-day trip)► WHAT WILL YOUR CONTRIBUTION SUPPORT?The cost of this ambitious Pacific Ocean crossing and performances is above and beyond the UuDam Studio and OCMA budgeted funds. This Indiegogo campaign is the catalyst to rally additional support needed to pay for the UuDam and his  assistant 6 weeks journey on a cargo ship and launching the third fingertip into California ocean. By donating to this campaign, you will help fund his and his assistant travel costs & equipment and provide modest housing during the 4-week long ocean travel & 2-week performance in California and airfare back to Việt Nam. Your support will also help provide honorariums for project collaborators, videographer, photographer, hotel and car rental, insurance, accommodations as well as video post-production, etc. The goal is to raise 19,000 USD to cover that cost.  Your gift will radically enhance the Time Boomerang exhibition project at OCMA by making it into reality in American continent.

These islands (atolls) are also claimed by Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Indonesia, and Malaysia. This bold overlapping exercise of powers with territorial map on an international scale made UuDam Tran Nguyen rethink the concept of measuring. He finds that exciting when the real distances of things being measured is not necessarily reflected scientifically or lawfully especially when it is influenced by desires, beliefs & national needs. He thinks about what one did when one was a child. One would measure things around them with their outstretched fingers: the first act of almost pure measuring. That’s when he made the first sculpture in the first phase of Time Boomerang. He casted his hand, fingers fully outstretched in his childhood measuring gesture, in metal. When it was completed, he cut out the five fingertips, and moved them away from the hand, symbolically extending his ability to measure (or mark new territories). These five places could be 5 corners of a museum, a university campus, a country, a continent, 5 continents of the Earth, 5 places in a Galaxy, or 5 Galaxies and so on. Phase #1: Cast hand and five fingertips ready for five continents ►INTRODUCTION TO TIME BOOMERANG, AMERICA PERFORMANCEOver a period of several years, UuDam will place the 5 fingertips in the oceans of five different continents. Until this moment, UuDam has successfully launched 2 of the 5 bronze fingertips into the waters of Europe and Australia continents as part of Phase #2 . By measuring the world, the artist wishes to elevate a regional conflict onto a vast time and space where mediated dialogues can take place without impassioned fistfights based on heated patriotism. The Time Boomerang is an on-going project made up of 8 phases. UuDam is pleased to present Phase #1, two parts of Phase #2, Phase #3 and Phase #4 for the first time in Orange County Museum of Art. This August, UuDam Tran Nguyen would like to complete the third part of Phase #2,  bring his third bronze fingertip to America. California will be the chosen destination.PHASE #2: The New Conqueror with a Good Passport. Part 3 of 5: America Performance      Phase #2: 30 days crossing the Pacific Ocean trip for the America performance - July-AugustIn July and August 2019, in conjunction with his exhibition currently on view at the Orange County Museum of Art,  the acclaimed Vietnamese artist UuDam Tran Nguyen will carry out his historic symbol-laden trip crossing the Pacific Ocean on a cargo ship. After that 30-day voyage, he will reach Los Angeles port. UuDam then will perform the dropping the third bronze fingertip into the California Pacific Ocean. Those two activities will complete Part 3 of Phase #2 of this 8-Phased Time Boomerang project.As the chief critic of OC WEEKLY Dave Barton wrote “Starting with the idea that a child uses his hand to measure things—and the image of a land grab is the perfect childish symbol for an empire—the artist has cast his hand, then cut of the tips of all five fingertips. Those sculpted fingertips will be dropped into bodies of water bordering five of the continents, as a performative way to reclaim territory. It’s essentially a nonsense gesture, but just as with many useless things signifying hope, he persists in doing it anyway.”    Phase #2: Europe Performance (picture by Polly Yassin)The crossing of the Pacific Ocean and the America performance later in California are continuing parts of the US debut of Time Boomerang at the Orange County Museum of Art from April 7, 2019 — Sept 1, 2019. This is a very special occasion to bring the TIME BOOMERANG's third bronze fingertip to the USA shore. Please join us in bringing this timely message of hope to California, a place that has prided itself on independent thinking, demographic diversity and home of the biggest Vietnamese-American community oversea that closely connected to the conflicts in the South China Sea, where this project got inspired from in the first place.     Phase #1, #2, #4 of Time Boomerang installation at National Art Center Tokyo, in the         SunShower exhibition ► AN OVERVIEW OF TIME BOOMERANGTIME BOOMERANG CONSISTS OF 8 PHASES:PHASE #1: The Real Distances of Things Being Measured Phase #1: Gilded bronze hand inside an engraved plexiglass box (picture by UuDam Studio)PHASE #2: The New Conqueror with a Good Passport, 5 parts     - Part 1: EUROPE (completed)On the 22nd of September 2015, UuDam traveled from Viet Nam to Sweden to launch the first of the five fingertips into the Gulf of Bothnia. The European performance is part of the TIME BOOMERANG Phase #2. During that time, Phase #1 was on display in the Miền Méo Miệng exhibition at Bildmuseet Museum.  Phase #2: Europe Performance (picture by Polly Yassin)- Part 2: AUSTRALIA (completed)On the 29th of November 2015, after two cancellations due to bad weather, the second bronze fingertip was launched into the Moreton Bay in Brisbane, Australia. UuDam was part of the 8th Asia Pacific Triennial while carrying out his second performance of the TIME BOOMERANG Phase #2. Phase #2: Australia Performance (picture by Chloë Callistemon)    - Part 3: AMERICA Performance (to be performed in August, 2019. This is where your funding is going to support).     - Part 4: AFRICA (to be announced)    - Part 5: ANTARCTICA (to be announced)PHASE #3: Digital Body Print - commissioned by OCMA By CAT scanning his body and extracting the bone part into digital files with his initial UDN carved all over. UuDam's skeleton could be printed in 3D on demand. This mimics the old practice of many war where one need to find the reason to occupy new territory. Once the bone is ready, the artist can bury them on any territory where he wants to possess.   Phase #3: Digital Body PrintPHASE #4: Cartography 101: Creating the Next Freaking World OrderBe our guest at the weekly breaking maps performance at OCMA.After ""conquering"" all five continents with his bronze fingertips, we have the power to turn it up side down and break it up.

<h3>Step Inside</h3>
<p>Beautiful Life is a gigantic, 12 m long, kaleidoscope powered by a projector which creates tessellations that move and change as you walk inside of the work. This interactive installation invites you to be the creator as you get lost in the world reflected around you.</p>
<p>We want to share Beautiful Life Project with you all, by touring it around Australia and then the world but we need your help to get it off the ground. Support us so we can bring it to an event near you.</p>
<p><strong>Our Rewards</strong></p>
<p>To thank you for your amazing support, we are excited to offer rewards directly inspired by the Beautiful Life Project. The amazing team of artists, designers and engineers behind this project chose the things that most excite and inspire them about the project to create all the gifts on offer.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573189503/taorkfljjhkibyrosgqu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Project Origins</h3>
<p>This started as a joke, but sometimes a joke is the only way to believe in the impossible. I was talking to a friend and we were discussing crazy project ideas and I asked, “Imagine what it would be like to walk inside a giant kaleidoscope”. Fast forward a few months and I was in Russia with my family and we started playing around with one from a local toy store. Drawing inspiration from the world’s most advanced artist – nature – we found that kaleidoscopic art was effortless, self-creating, limitless and gave everyone the opportunity to become an incredible artist.</p>
<p>Building some larger prototypes exploring different shapes and sizes, I knew the idea was something I should pursue when my grandma stuck her head inside and started playing like she was 5 years old again! This was going to be a project that engages all ages.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573033543/laqgm0lxvh4p0mjrnzeu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are inspired by art that enables the observer to be a co-creator and technology that brings people together rather than keeps us apart. The art that blurs the lines between artist and audience, child and adult, creator and consumer. By breaking down these walls we want to invoke a childlike joy in every person who steps inside, as the simple images move around them, reminding us all that there is indeed is Beautiful Life all around us.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Project Description</span></h3>
<p>We've ordered some materials and started construction but we need your help to get us across the finish line. Help us bring this project to life!</p>
<p>Beautiful Life Project is a massive undertaking, standing at 12m long and 3.7 m tall at its highest point. A complex steel frame underlies the structure with cladding on the outside and mirror panels covering the interior. A projector and screen set at the back of the structure provide a base for the kaleidoscopic tessellations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573033712/wgyhvgx24oajfmnmwspp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Stepping inside, the viewer is enveloped in mirrors, where they experience the kaleidoscope’s tessellations all around them. Their reflections become incorporated into the image, drawing them further into the artwork. A camera, provided, allows participants the option of filming themselves and world around them which is then projected back into the space.</p>
<p>Most kaleidoscopes produce a flat, 2-dimensional image, however, by tapering the structure we worked out we could use the mirrors to produce a 3-dimensional experience. The reflections within Beautiful Life create a sphere 18 meters in diameter around the viewer. This represents our earth, within our beautiful life, and the many facets that come with it. Through this imagery and by playing videos of nature, we want to remind the audience that beauty and nature are intrinsically linked and how important it is to take care of this precious resource.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573099918/imggw4rvoddisq6mdr9g.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The artwork on the exterior walls is created in collaboration with muralist Karri McPherson. Karri’s design was inspired by her love of geometric shapes and the underlying geometry and tessellation at the heart of a kaleidoscope. Using 34 different colours, her artwork hints at the multifaceted colourful experience within.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573033742/gv6kmbsx5clih283llks.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We want to share this project with you so much that we’ve taken a gamble and started construction, but we need your support to fully bring it to life. The project requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 500 m of steel </li>
<li>84m2 of external cladding</li>
<li>84 m2 of mirrors </li>
<li>80 cans of spray paint </li>
<li>1.5 tons of steel ballast </li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Plus projectors, nuts, bolts, screws, glue and hours of loving labour to bring it to life.</p>
<p>To date we have generously been supported by friends in lending us tools, time and a space to work but we need some further financing to get the project over the line. The more money we raise, the more awesome an experience it will be.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><h3>Opportunities</h3></div>
<p>Any money in addition to our goal will go to improving the technology and making it more interactive including:</p>
<ul>
<li>An external light experience (as envisioned below)</li>
<li>An interactive sound component</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>But the sky is the limit – our dream additions include changing our ballast to solar charged batteries to help festivals and other events minimise their impact on the environment.</p>

The crowdfunding will go towards material costs and overheads during this initial stage.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Design Details</h3>
<p>The design of the kaleidoscope is significant both mathematically and artistically.</p>
<p>The pentagon shape is key to the design. Beautiful Life is a floret pentagon, one of the most beautiful forms, characterised by symmetry about its peak, and all other angles are at 120 degrees. There are only a few types of pentagons that will tessellate in a way that allows the kaleidoscope reflections to occur. It is called a floret pentagon because the shape tessellates as a flower, which unfolds before you as you step inside the kaleidoscope. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573093892/fmwnkne3ppyt6aefutya.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The floret shape is also significant because it is the shape which most closely matches the human body. By shaping the work this way, the kaleidoscope becomes physically accessible to all people. More than that, the work is inviting to the audience and without audience participation the artwork is incomplete.</p>
<p>As environmentally conscious engineers, we also looked at how we could minimise the amount of material used without compromising on the experience. Compared to other shapes, the pentagon provides the most efficient material usage to space ratio.</p>

</div></div>","Step Inside
Beautiful Life is a gigantic, 12 m long, kaleidoscope powered by a projector which creates tessellations that move and change as you walk inside of the work. This interactive installation invites you to be the creator as you get lost in the world reflected around you.
We want to share Beautiful Life Project with you all, by touring it around Australia and then the world but we need your help to get it off the ground. Support us so we can bring it to an event near you.
Our Rewards
To thank you for your amazing support, we are excited to offer rewards directly inspired by the Beautiful Life Project. The amazing team of artists, designers and engineers behind this project chose the things that most excite and inspire them about the project to create all the gifts on offer.

 
Project Origins
This started as a joke, but sometimes a joke is the only way to believe in the impossible. I was talking to a friend and we were discussing crazy project ideas and I asked, “Imagine what it would be like to walk inside a giant kaleidoscope”. Fast forward a few months and I was in Russia with my family and we started playing around with one from a local toy store. Drawing inspiration from the world’s most advanced artist – nature – we found that kaleidoscopic art was effortless, self-creating, limitless and gave everyone the opportunity to become an incredible artist.
Building some larger prototypes exploring different shapes and sizes, I knew the idea was something I should pursue when my grandma stuck her head inside and started playing like she was 5 years old again! This was going to be a project that engages all ages.

We are inspired by art that enables the observer to be a co-creator and technology that brings people together rather than keeps us apart. The art that blurs the lines between artist and audience, child and adult, creator and consumer. By breaking down these walls we want to invoke a childlike joy in every person who steps inside, as the simple images move around them, reminding us all that there is indeed is Beautiful Life all around us.
 

Project Description
We've ordered some materials and started construction but we need your help to get us across the finish line. Help us bring this project to life!
Beautiful Life Project is a massive undertaking, standing at 12m long and 3.7 m tall at its highest point. A complex steel frame underlies the structure with cladding on the outside and mirror panels covering the interior. A projector and screen set at the back of the structure provide a base for the kaleidoscopic tessellations.

Stepping inside, the viewer is enveloped in mirrors, where they experience the kaleidoscope’s tessellations all around them. Their reflections become incorporated into the image, drawing them further into the artwork. A camera, provided, allows participants the option of filming themselves and world around them which is then projected back into the space.
Most kaleidoscopes produce a flat, 2-dimensional image, however, by tapering the structure we worked out we could use the mirrors to produce a 3-dimensional experience. The reflections within Beautiful Life create a sphere 18 meters in diameter around the viewer. This represents our earth, within our beautiful life, and the many facets that come with it. Through this imagery and by playing videos of nature, we want to remind the audience that beauty and nature are intrinsically linked and how important it is to take care of this precious resource.
 

 
The artwork on the exterior walls is created in collaboration with muralist Karri McPherson. Karri’s design was inspired by her love of geometric shapes and the underlying geometry and tessellation at the heart of a kaleidoscope. Using 34 different colours, her artwork hints at the multifaceted colourful experience within.

We want to share this project with you so much that we’ve taken a gamble and started construction, but we need your support to fully bring it to life. The project requires:

More than 500 m of steel 
84m2 of external cladding
84 m2 of mirrors 
80 cans of spray paint 
1.5 tons of steel ballast 

Plus projectors, nuts, bolts, screws, glue and hours of loving labour to bring it to life.
To date we have generously been supported by friends in lending us tools, time and a space to work but we need some further financing to get the project over the line. The more money we raise, the more awesome an experience it will be.
 
Opportunities
Any money in addition to our goal will go to improving the technology and making it more interactive including:

An external light experience (as envisioned below)
An interactive sound component

But the sky is the limit – our dream additions include changing our ballast to solar charged batteries to help festivals and other events minimise their impact on the environment.


 
Several festivals have shown interest in the work and we are determined to take it all around Australia, and then the world, so you all can experience the childlike joy of Beautiful Life. But given its size, we are going to need the help of everyone to make this happen. We are expecting a final build cost to exceed $50k plus labour and transportation. The crowdfunding will go towards material costs and overheads during this initial stage.

 

Design Details
The design of the kaleidoscope is significant both mathematically and artistically.
The pentagon shape is key to the design. Beautiful Life is a floret pentagon, one of the most beautiful forms, characterised by symmetry about its peak, and all other angles are at 120 degrees. There are only a few types of pentagons that will tessellate in a way that allows the kaleidoscope reflections to occur. It is called a floret pentagon because the shape tessellates as a flower, which unfolds before you as you step inside the kaleidoscope. 

The floret shape is also significant because it is the shape which most closely matches the human body. By shaping the work this way, the kaleidoscope becomes physically accessible to all people. More than that, the work is inviting to the audience and without audience participation the artwork is incomplete.
As environmentally conscious engineers, we also looked at how we could minimise the amount of material used without compromising on the experience. Compared to other shapes, the pentagon provides the most efficient material usage to space ratio.
 

The Team
Nikita Shtepa is the creative director of Beautiful Life Project. He is an engineer turned artist, creating interactive digital installation. Based in Australia, Nik has displayed at the Brisbane Street Art Festival in 2019 with Sound of Touch, an installation which allowed participants to use the human body as a musical instrument. Sound was created by holding hands and exploring how to create melodies through touch. Nikita has a background in R&D working on industrial sized solar projects and has a lot of experience in large scale installations.
Karri McPherson is a contemporary painter and muralist. She explores geometric art in relation to different special confinements. Beautiful Life is the largest canvas she has worked on to date and her geometric style makes the outside of the project an artwork in its own right. Karri has been involved in over forty exhibitions throughout Australia and the United States.

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Living in Norwich, Siris is a strong advocate for mental health awareness. His mission is to challenge public stigmas and create opportunities for people to engage in their community through art.</p>
<p>Since 2017, Siris has created exhibitions that focus on offering a personal insight into living with mental illnesses, to create conversations in public spaces and normalise talking about mental health. 'I deliberately pick public spaces, where people go organically, I want to challenge people by bringing mental health into their day to day lives.' - Siris Hill.</p>
<p>Due to his health, working in a scheduled environment is near impossible for him. It’s his dream to become recognised as an artist and to be able to make a living from something he can do that fits around his health.</p>
<p>‘I just want to make enough to live on and to fund my ideas continue to do what drives me, which is improve the lives of others with mental illness by challenging stigmas and creating opportunities and events to engage people in the arts and to share the power of creativity for well-being with others. I have so many ideas, I just don’t want anyone else to feel like I have and to feel like they’re on their own. It breaks my heart.’ Siris.</p>
<p>In 2018 Siris collaborated with Rethink Mental Illness after gaining their attention by inviting them to one of his previous exhibitions. Alongside Stuart Hellingsworth and Joe Haynes who work for Rethink mental Illness, Siris helped direct and curated 'Art of the Mind', an exhibition in Norwich showing works from artists from Rethink's various art groups around the country.</p>
<p>Following on from this he has been developing an arts class that will be hosted in Norwich and supported by Rethink to offer a place to come create and have fun for anyone struggling with their mental health, starting in April this year.</p>
<p>To date, through sharing his own journey from the worst times to his recovery he has been able to empower thousands through social media, creating a movement centred around his art and offers opportunities for other people in their communities to share their artwork with the public.</p>
<p>He has also attracted the attention of high profile artists, galleries, local press and TV and curators including Penelope Hines, a former curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum, all of whom have either offered opportunities or guidance and shown support in furthering his message through exposing his work.</p>
<p>In 2018 Siris' work was also discovered by agent Oliver Squirrell, who got in touch after experiencing Siris' work at the NUA degree show. The work at the show and on Siris' website resonated deeply with Oliver and he felt compelled to help Siris in his mission of challenging mental health stigmas and developing his artistic career further.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
<p>Siris has now been offered the opportunity to exhibit his work at the Moniker Arts Fair, which is hosted on Broadway, Manhattan in New York.</p>
<p>Having reviewed his work and connected with his story, the arts fair got in touch and offered him a unique space. Moniker only select a handful of individual artists each year, the majority of the space is taken up by galleries around the world to showcase the best in urban contemporary arts.</p>
<p>This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Siris, and potentially life changing. You can help get him there by backing this campaign!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><h3>Siris' Story (in his own words) </h3><p>I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease as a baby when I was given a lifesaving blood transfusion I spent the first 15 years of my life in and out of hospitals and doctors surgeries and the treatment I received and the feeling of having no control or understanding of the things that were done to me have become to root cause of my mental health. At 19 I had my first panic attack. From there my life completely changed overnight. I went from being outdoorsy and adventuress to being confined in my bedroom afraid to leave and struggling to not hyperventilate constantly. This increased the bad relationship I had with my mum and she ended up asking me to leave. I didn’t have anywhere to go, between sofa surfing and sleeping rough I basically lost my mind.</p><p>When I was willing to take my life I remember thinking to myself if you are willing to end everything you must be willing to start again. I decided if I couldn’t find happiness within myself that I would help others and find meaning through that. Shortly after this I curated an exhibition for Rethink Mental Illness in my hometown. This provided an opportunity for artists from their art groups to share their work with the public the response the received and the conversations I had with the public regarding mental health was incredibly positive. It showed me how important art is and how it can be used to not only help people suffering but to educate the public and challenge their ideas of mental health, that I too had when I was younger. Challenging that fear and creating empathy as a replacement is powerful. It strengthens communities. I started sharing my work online and have gained a small following of people who often message me to thank me for speaking out and sharing my journey or that they’ve been able to connect with family members by showing my work and then opening up and talking with them about themselves.  Not having a home or a safe place to go when you rest is terrifying, but the hardest thing for me is not having a place to go that’s away from my mind. Art has given me that, it’s one of the very few things that brings silence to me.<br/><br/>I continue to make art because it has given me a voice, a purpose and taught me discipline, which in turn has strengthened my mind and allowed me to take the same approach I have used to learn to paint to tackle my recovery head-on.</p><p>During my degree, I have continued to develop my practice and push my personal boundaries. I’ve created a small community who seem to feel empowered by my work and that has encouraged me to continue to speak out and tackle the stigma those with mental illnesses face in our society. To give a voice not only to myself but the thousands of people out there who are suffering, feeling lost and let down by their country and community.</p><p>I have been focusing on raising the profile of myself as an artist and a mental health awareness advocate in an attempt to reach more people to share my story and my message. As a result of this I have been offered a place to exhibit at Moniker Arts fair in New York, Manhattan in May.</p><p>This is a dream come true, to be able to exhibit my works and share my message with people not only internationally, but on Broadway in New York, it’s unbelievable. This is not only an achievement for myself but also a great opportunity to help challenge mental health stigmas at an international level and create a personalised insight on topics that are incredibly important.</p><p>I would be extremely grateful of any support that you could provide with regards to promoting my crowdfunding campaign.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>REWARDS</strong></h2><p><strong>A3 Print available prints: </strong>When donating to this reward, please comment on the title of the Print you would like to receive: The options are shown below. </p><p>Ashes</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548600494/m6gs3vhmr2umfmablcm5.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>Faceless Maiden</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548600512/usqhxvufidiflad65gmo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Print details...</p><p>Archival giclée print</p><p>Printed on Hahnemuehle Photo Rag 308gsm (smooth)</p><p>A3 Print - Size Includes border for framing. </p><p>Print may vary slightly due to variation in monitor screens</p><p> </p><p><strong>Signed Limited Edition Prints: </strong>When donating to this reward, please comment on the title of the Print you would like to receive: The options are shown below. </p><p>La Muerte Seductora</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548600801/avyzqzoeedfhmyp4vhwu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Cruciation</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548600842/ztpb0leicmngrgesrjh5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The Weight of Silence</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548600859/pmpnirrbwzmq4iww4ria.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Print details...</p><p>Each image is limited to 30 copies </p><p>Archival giclée print</p><p>printed on Hahnemuehle Photo Rag 308gsm (smooth)</p><p>A3 Print - Size Includes border for framing. </p><p>Print may vary slightly due to variation in monitor screens</p><p> </p><p><strong>Private Tutoring:</strong></p><p>Siris will offer 3 sessions of one-hour video calls one a week for three weeks to discuss your artistic work and current goals, critique and offer guidance.

<p>  Coming from a Taiwanese/Belgian family, I have always loved bubble tea since a young age, I would patiently be waiting every summer to go back to Taiwan to drink bubble tea at night markets every single day for 2 whole months!</p>
<p>And on top of that, I have always loved animals since a young age!</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, I have a new family member: an Australian Shepherd puppy!</p>
<p>I decided to name him Boba (short for bubble tea), and this whole idea of making a toy started when we went to have bubble tea together when Boba was only 2 and a half months old. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610408655/jvbfalqqzxzmy2kkpi4l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We decided to take a few pictures of him with the bubble tea, and saw that he had pocked a little hole on the side to lick the milk tea. He was definitely loving it and it was so cute. At that moment, I knew I had to make a bubble tea plushie toy for pets!</p>

<p>I'm going to exhibit my piece of furniture - a dressing table at the Salone del Mobile event at Lambrate Design District on the 9 - 14 April 2019. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where will the money go?</h3>
<p>I am raising money to fund this project which is divided into these parts: </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Production costs - <strong>1100 €</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>The dressing table is made of natural oak wood combined with brass legs and frame for the mirrors, leather tabletop and porcelain knobs for the drawers.</p>
<p>Everything is handmade by local artisans and porcelain knobs are handmade by me. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Participation fee - <strong>1305,4€</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>This amount covers the fee required for the registration and the exhibition stand.  </p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>The patent - <strong>600€</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>This amount covers the fee of registering my design with a lawyer to protect the concept in the European Union. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I'm lucky enough to raise beyond that amount I will use the money to cover all the extra costs such as transportation fees, stand design, setting up the website, ordering business cards and all the costs related to the travel - plane ticket to Milan, accommodation, etc. </p>

I'm a young interiors and furniture designer from Lithuania. I graduated from Glasgow School of Art and Politecnico di Milano, studying Bachelors of Interior Design. At the moment I'm working as a freelance interior designer on various projects. It is my dream to participate in such an event as Salone del Mobile as a furniture designer and I would be so happy if you could help me to make it happen! 
 
What is my project? 
I'm going to exhibit my piece of furniture - a dressing table at the Salone del Mobile event at Lambrate Design District on the 9 - 14 April 2019.

I am raising money to fund this project which is divided into these parts:

The dressing table is made of natural oak wood combined with brass legs and frame for the mirrors, leather tabletop and porcelain knobs for the drawers.
Everything is handmade by local artisans and porcelain knobs are handmade by me.

<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>Few people are lucky enough to have been blessed with both the means to hone their craft, the passion to shape it, and the exposure to make a difference in this world.<strong> Art. Passion. Love.</strong></p>
<p>Even fewer are given a second chance to pursue their passions. I am proud to say that for the second time in my life I feel empowered to try and, if the universe wills it, to impact the world around me through my art.</p>
<p>After earning my theatre degree at UCLA, I traveled to Turkey to rediscover my roots since I’m half Turkish and half American. I ended up working professionally there as both an actress for the State Theatre and a faculty member/director for a conservatory.  <strong>Art. Passion. Love.</strong></p>
<p>Due to a set of events best described as “larger than life” I decided to fight for the right to adopt as a single woman in a country that did not allow it.  After changing some laws and adopting my son, I relocated back to the United States. I needed stable income but still wanted to feel passion, so I chose nonprofits and then went into Human Resources. I could continue to help and serve others while growing as a business leader. <strong>Humans. Passion. Love.</strong></p>
<p>Then tragedy set in when my mother was diagnosed with cancer. As I cared for her and continued to work, I found art once again. I started creating miniature worlds in lanterns – I found that I could protect these worlds from tragedy.  I, also, started painting and the colors I used became an extension of my being.</p>
<p>Struggles in life continued but in the quiet moments, I realized that by focusing on my passions in a new way, my art hobby had blossomed into a small business. I was amazed when someone liked one of my creations enough to take it into their home to look at every day! <i>Wow, this still amazes me.</i></p>
<p>Then more setbacks for all of us!  COVID19.  Lost my job.  As I looked for work in panic and distress, it would all disappear in the moments when I created.  <strong>Art. Passion. Love.</strong></p>
<p>With the support and love of family and friends but against their sound advice (!), I have decided to make this an even bigger part of my life.</p>
<p><strong>My Art, The Goal &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>My creations range from abstract acrylic paintings to jewelry created from those paintings to three-dimensional works through my miniatures. Colorful. Hopeful. Jovial. </p>
<p>We may not always be able to keep tragedy away but sometimes out of tragedy can come a greater <strong>Hope. Passion. Love.</strong>  </p>
<p>The initial seed of $3000 can help me share my art with the world.</p>
<p>As you read my story, I hope you see that I have demonstrated skills but, most importantly, tenacity and persistence. I created a business plan to make this dream comes true. Now I just need some help. The first part of the plan is to create a professional website and implement other marketing strategies to show (to the world and myself!) that I can create a business out of <strong>Art. Passion. Love.</strong></p>
<p>If you choose to support this project, aside from the perks provided, I will keep you up-to-date as I work through this dream and, hopefully, my success can be an inspiration for you or others to ‘work’ through their passions.</p>

Mi presento:
Mi chiamo Emiliano Campagnola sono un attore e regista e da qualche anno sto sviluppando un progetto che si chiama Ecovillaggio La Giostra Vite9.                          Un Ecovillaggio creativo è un luogo che sa donare esperienze, saperi e uno spazio dove stare, provare, confrontarsi...L'intento è di unire la creatività artistica, il vivere naturale, le nuove tecnologie, verso l'autosufficienza energetica, idrica e alimentare. Un luogo dove formarsi e sperimentare queste attitudini.
Uno spazio dove mettere in rapporto sinergico vita e arte. 
L'avvio di questo motore di fantasia alla Giostra , concretamente potrà avere inizio a breve, manca solo un piccolo passaggio, il trasporto dei materiali sul posto. Questa primavera è previsto l'arrivo di due strutture semipermanenti: uno Chapiteau (tenda da circo francese) e il materiale del Big Bambù, (Opera-installazione del Macro). Più info sullo Chapiteau sul sito - TheenthusiasticsLo Chapiteau col suo rosso fiammante è uno spazio scenico, è festa, è magia. Al momento si trova in Sicilia e per farlo arrivare dobbiamo affittare una motrice per un rimorchio che arriverà via mare a Civitavecchia intorno al 20 marzo in tempo per il Solstizio di Primavera. Con il vostro aiuto potremmo far nascere insieme lo Chapiteau alla Giostra con una iniziatica esperienza di allestimento.Il Big Bambù è un opera dei due artisti gemelli americani Mike e Doug Starn esposta per 3 anni all'entrata del Macro a Testaccio. Abbiamo proposto ai responsabili della struttura di prenderci cura di tutto il materiale che sarà smontato a breve, per rigenerarlo in altre strutture che ne mantengano il valore. Rigenerando il meraviglioso materiale che compone l'opera, per realizzare strutture utili all'Ecovillaggio e altre creazioni. Tutto il bambù sarà materiale per un laboratorio di progettazione e costruzione tenuto da Stefan Pollak di AK0, architettura a chilometri zero.Per questa fase imminente è necessario raccogliere 3500€ il soldi raccolti serviranno per:
Trasporto Chapiteau 1000€
Preparazione terreno e allacci per lo Chapiteau 500€
Trasporto Big Bambù 1000€
Preparazione terreno e stoccaggio Bambù 500€
Preparazione casetta di appoggio per lavori e laboratori 500€Se non vuoi usare PayPal:  iban IT65D0760105138276650776653
I costi degli affitti dei camion possono essere differenti da quelli indicati, garantiamo comunque tutti i fondi raccolti in questa fase saranno utilizzati per le spese di avvio e messa in moto della Giostra.In cambio di una donazione offriamo passeggiate, spuntini, seminari, orti, spettacoli, feste...  

E molti altri doni che riceverete o verrete a ritirare alla Giostra come il poter coltivare i propri ortaggi in un ambiente amico e festeggiante durante i solstizi e gli equinozi , dove creare la propria bacchetta magica ad ogni età, dove trovare amuleti nascosti, dove potrete degustare o meno quello che arriverà dai carri e carretti in giro per prodotti buoni, ci dispiace un po' dover dare la scintilla al motore della Giostra ancora col petrolio, che come dice il saggio; ""Non ci prendiamo per il culo, è finito!"" La Transizione è da queste cose che comincia e da questi luoghi si impara a farlo reciprocamente.

<div><span style="""">I love making my art with the public so I'm honored that I've been invited to set up a table at South By South West (SXSW).

At that table, I hope to engage the public by having them participate in my art making process.

<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I have arranged for a free place to stay.   (Thanks Emma and Phillip!!!!)</div>
<div>I need funds for art supplies, airfare and food. If I could raise additional money to cover the week that I'll be taking off of work, that would be great.

I've estimated $150 for groceries and maybe 1 meal out.  I'll be taking 4 days/roughly 40 hours off of work which equals around a $350 pay check. </div>
<div>The <span style=""background-color: initial;"">perks you can choose from range from a little sticker collection of art to an actual vinyl sticker stating ""Love, APS"".

<div>I will not be making any money on this venture. It is purely a way to bring this unique experience the audience of SXSW to join-in and get creative. <br/>
</div>
<div>I've set up art-making stations at numerous events such as CRAFTED at O'Connors Brewery, The Renewal Art Show at The Warehouse, at the opening weekend of Alchemy's Pop The Trunk event and various other arts and craft events in Coastal Virginia. The children embrace the projects and dive right in. Some adults eagerly contribute but others are very apprehensive. They state ""I can't even draw a stick figure"".

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The new product line will consist of two series. The Big
FaceMe and little FaceMe pendants, this series come from a unique and custom
design made by me, based on the face of the future owner and are available in
two presentations:</p>
<p><b>1.</b>The little FaceMe pendants measure approximately 2
½ ""x 2 ½"" . In this presentation the hair is cut piece by piece and
the face is carved and painted by hand, carrying a metal edging and a little
silver ring.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>2.</b>The big FaceMe measures approximately 7 ½"" x 7
½"". In these pieces the hair and face are more detailed and its
manufacture is more complex, carrying a metal edging and a support so it can be
hung or placed on any surface.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">These FaceMe are perfect for personalizing spaces, can
be embedded in a cabinet, or just above the bedside table with a candle at the
base.</p>
<p>The possibilities are as many as objects surrounding

</p>
<h2><b>OBJECTIVES</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In April we will start the edging manufacturing, It
will be necessary to contact artisans from the region of Taxco to co-work with
them on the process (Taxco is the place where the finest silver is made).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After the most suitable strategy is decided for the
manufacturing process we will be on a testing stage to ensure that pendants are
fully wearable and resistant.</p>
<p>If everything goes fine by May we will start with the
production process.</p>
<p>The online store will be ready to open by August as
well as the appropriate advertising channels to generate presence around the
world.</p>

</div></div>","About
We are very excited
for this new product line because it comes from a year of development and
perfection of glass mosaic manufacturing techniques. What makes FaceMe pendants
innovative is that they are unique and exclusive pieces of design, customized specially for each
client from the creative vision of the artist based on the face of the future
owner. 
Project
The purpose
of this campaign is not only to complete the development of a new product line
but also the creation of the official online store as well as the broadcast
channels and advertising necessary.With your
support we will be able to give the Talisman and FaceMe series the final touch
that is fundamental for this pieces, adding a silver edging and a little ring
to give them a nice finish.

We will also
create the online IkoMozis Art store and work on the advertising and social
channels to generate presence around the world.     
IkoMozis
Art
IkoMozis Art is the result of four years of work on
perfecting the technique of glass mosaic combined with art and design.
Currently, in IkoMozis Art, unique decorative art
pieces are created from our own designs, custom requests and reinterpretation
of classic art pieces. 





 
IkoMozis Art pieces reinterpreting Water Serpents (Gustav Klimt), Starry
night (Van Gogh) and El Bañador (Pablo Picasso).




FaceMe
series
The new product line will consist of two series. The Big
FaceMe and little FaceMe pendants, this series come from a unique and custom
design made by me, based on the face of the future owner and are available in
two presentations:
1.The little FaceMe pendants measure approximately 2
½ ""x 2 ½"" . In this presentation the hair is cut piece by piece and
the face is carved and painted by hand, carrying a metal edging and a little
silver ring.








2.The big FaceMe measures approximately 7 ½"" x 7
½"". In these pieces the hair and face are more detailed and its
manufacture is more complex, carrying a metal edging and a support so it can be
hung or placed on any surface.
These FaceMe are perfect for personalizing spaces, can
be embedded in a cabinet, or just above the bedside table with a candle at the
base.
The possibilities are as many as objects surrounding
you.


                                   


Talisman
series (Special Edition)


The Talisman series is a special edition for the
perks of indiegogo, currently has four models and all the designs will be
completed by the end of February, it will feature 10 talisman models crafted in
glass mosaic, each one measuring approximately 1 ¾"" x 1 ¾"" (with a
metal edging and a little silver ring).




Our special way to say thank you










Ikomozis Art wallpapers.



Customized FaceMe
style designs. 



*Keep in mind that some perks including the Talisman,
Big FaceMe and FaceMe pendants are crafted by hand, therefore a certain period
of time is required for the elaboration process.



OBJECTIVES
In April we will start the edging manufacturing, It
will be necessary to contact artisans from the region of Taxco to co-work with
them on the process (Taxco is the place where the finest silver is made).
After the most suitable strategy is decided for the
manufacturing process we will be on a testing stage to ensure that pendants are
fully wearable and resistant.
If everything goes fine by May we will start with the
production process.
The online store will be ready to open by August as
well as the appropriate advertising channels to generate presence around the
world.







The
artist
A. Lucrecia Vélez is the founder of IkoMozis Art. She
has gained recognition throughout her art career exposing at international
Biennales and local contests.
