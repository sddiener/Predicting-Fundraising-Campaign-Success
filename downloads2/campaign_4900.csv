Hello world! 

We are The Soulflower Group and we need your
help rebuilding the mind and spirit of a community and region ravaged
particularly hard by the pain of our nation's economic downturn. We want to
build on our past efforts and include our new ideas. Our next step on this
journey is to bring to life our desire to curate a series of performances --
performances that build a sense of community wellness that stretches far beyond
the typical acts that stop off in our home: California’s Central Valley. 

We began this August by hosting the amazing Grammy®-nominated
artist Bilal. The show was a success of the spirit, but less rewarding financially. We are hobbled by a lack of seed money that will bring stability to our
efforts. Please help us rekindle deeper forms of expression in a community
that needs to feel something. Something more. We invite you to help launch the Soulflower Group Speakeasy series, a
collection of 5 performances and happenings we would like to produce over the
next 6 months.
 
The
first Soulflower Speakeasy would pair a nationally-recognized poet with local
poets, artists, music and special performances. We will begin with
singer, emcee, and HBO Def Jam poet and New Orleans native Sunni Patterson --
whose 2007 visit to the Valley left such a positive impression we
felt she would be the ideal spirit to reignite the movement.

Some History About Our Roots
In November of 2003, one of California's premiere poetry rooms closed its curtains. Devoya Mayo
hosted 44 shows and 216 poets over the span of three short years. In that
time The Ahh Yeah Poetry Jam was a spoken-word staple in
the Central Valley. Ahh Yeah was created and fostered with the intention of
bringing together diverse communities under one roof, and it succeeded in its
goal. Community leaders, emerging
and established poets, youth, elders, emcees, punks, professors, and musicians
alike all rocked the mic with Devoya, month after month, helping to
bridge cultural divides that often hide in plain sight.
When Ahh Yeah concluded, Devoya began to build on
her community organizing skills and was invited to take part in a
project sponsored by The American Friends Service Committee where she and 17
other organizers from the U.S traveled to Africa and worked with organizers
from the continent on the Life over Debt campaign. In 2005 she in turn was asked to help
coordinate the U.S. Campus Speaking tour to inform youth and communities across
the Midwest about the Life Over Debt campaign. 

Enter the Soulflower Group
In 2010, Devoya started The Soulflower Group, a consortium of local creatives who are committed to help rebuild our varied communities via performance, design, music, photography and the like. We all share a common vision of creating spaces and environments that people deserve rather than just settle for.
As a collective The Soulflower Group has two tiers of service. In-house
we produce, create and execute gatherings that foster community wellness. We
firmly believe that folks do better when they feel better, and we approach
every idea with this tenet in mind. Externally, our consultants deliver
creativity for individuals who may not otherwise have access to a creative
department. Each idea is funded out of pocket via members, with reimbursement
following thereafter.

What We Need 

Your help will cover costs of transportation/lodging for both the featured performer and her child, opening poets from outside the area as well as production and documentation costs. All documentation will be used in our efforts to recruit other performers to the Fresno area. Any funds you give beyond our initial funding amount will be used to produce the subsequent events in the series. All proceeds are returned back into the Speakeasy Series with the goal of becoming self-sustaining. Make no mistake we will exhaust every avenue to host this series. If we do not meet our funding goal we'll host the first installment and seek alternative options for all future performances.

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img3.etsystatic.com/002/0/6188665/iusb_760x100.9709863_p4c5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/Customcomix?ref=si_shop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Custom Comix</a> is a small family owned business that creates one-of-a-kind wearable pieces of comic book art. Every piece is made by hand and uses actual upcycled comic book / manga pages. We are the creators of the original comic book bracelets that have been on Etsy the past two years ( and counting!) </p>
<center><img alt=""Holly"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/296090_4659938064316_1455429865_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Holly""/></center>
<p>Custom Comix is made up of 2 1/2 people. My name is Holly Donahue and I hand make every item in my shop. I am also in charge of packaging, running the online store and all of the online social networks associated with Custom Comix, and I love every second of it!</p>
<p>Ryan Grant is my boyfriend and he is in charge of shipping off all of the items to their new homes. He is also my main support system and helps come up with new ideas for the shop, as well as help keep me grounded when convention season is here. He is also the muscle that builds all of the displays at each convention.</p>
<center><img alt=""fam"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/60729_4830532489070_813677706_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""family""/></center>
<p>My daughter Carmen ( or Batgirl as she demans to be called today) is 2 1/2 and helps where she can. Her tiny hands aren't ready to help me craft but that doesnt stop her from trying. She also helps to remind me why I do what I do everyday. She is my geekling in training and probably my biggest fan!</p>
<h3>How Custom Comix Started:</h3>
<p>If you are here and you know of my little shop, it is probably because you either are, or have a proud geek girl in your life. Have you tried shopping for her? 2 years ago when I opened up my shop, there was little to nothing out there for the geek girl to buy to flaunt her interets-- that was made with HER in mind. You couldn't go into Walmart to pick up a Tank Girl bracelet.. or anything Tank Girl for that matter. ( You still can't!) The fans of smaller fandoms were crying out for something for THEM but it wa falling on deaf ears. Coming back empty handed on a search for something for myself, I decided to just make something. Ryan joined in and that is how the comic book bracelet was born!</p>
<p>I was working full time at a bank and one of my clients loved my bracelet and told me about Etsy. I listed a couple of bracelets and found that I was not the only one frustrated with the selection of items available for geeky girls, and my shop took off! I was able to quit my bank job and stay home full time with my little one. </p>
<p><img alt=""collage"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://25.media.tumblr.com/cda8e8922cbb56c5ad3f4ecb4a3f8d43/tumblr_mg9e2gcLUs1qmjtoeo1_500.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""collage""/></p>
<p>We have come a long way since our first bracelet, and our line has really evolved since then. Two years ago we sold only bracelets and now we are able to offer earrings and most recently pendants in our line of products. I love being able to create unique items for amazing ladies and hearing their stories and seeing how happy my items make them really give me that drive to push the Custom Comix name. </p>
<p>I would love to offer a broader range of items to meet the requests of my supporters. Recently, I put out a product survey and got a huge response-- You told us what you would like to see us cover and smother next, and we REALLY want to bring that to you! That's what brings us to Indiegogo... </p>
<h3>New Products You Say??</h3>
<p>The goal amount that we need is $1000, and we plan on working for it. Here is a list of items and descriptions that we would love to offer in our shop. With $1000 we would be able to buy all of the pieces, machinery and tools needed to get us started with these new products. </p>
<center><img alt=""rings"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://25.media.tumblr.com/733f27088977699ca330a852b7f1e760/tumblr_mg9fvgyYGk1qmjtoeo1_r1_250.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""rings""/></center>
<p><strong>-RINGS!: </strong>Those of you who filled out our product survey, 90% of you suggested you would like to see rings for sale in our shop. The ones that we have our eye on are sterling silver in color, adjustable in size and like our pentants, they will have real glass placed on top of an image from a comic book to protect it. They will be round in shape and be 20mm in size.</p>
<center><img alt=""cuffs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/29dacb4026dbf510559da366c121c1fd/tumblr_mg9g88pEAg1qmjtoeo1_500.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""cuffs""/></center>
<p><strong>-CUFFLINKS!: </strong>MEN!! We really want to include the men this time around. It is always so sad to see guys sulk away from our booth when we are at conventions, so it would be nice to be able to include them! These cufflinks would be similar to the rinfs that we would like to offer. They will be silver in color and have a comic book image covered with a piece of glass to protect it. I am undecided on the shape as of right now, square or circle-- but if we go over our goal, I can experiment with both! These cufflinks would be great for adding a bit of geek flare for the business men out there, or a great accessory for dances or weddings!</p>
<p><strong>-MAGNETS/KEYCHAINS!: </strong>Right now, I do have pin back buttons, but I do not offer them in my etsy shop just yet. I want the ability to offer not only buttons, but the option for magnets and keychains! They would all measure 1 1/4 inches in length and be round in shape. </p>
<p><img alt=""buttons"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://24.media.tumblr.com/9e22113990f824bff45ba7ee46574993/tumblr_mg9fr0MnlD1qmjtoeo1_500.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""buttons""/></p>
<p><strong>-POCKET MIRRORS!: </strong>The pocket mirrors that we want are 2 1/4in big and will have a comic book image on one side which will be protected by a plastic casing similar to a very large pin back button and on the other side will be the mirror. These would be great to stash in your purse for emergencies!</p>
<p><strong>-VIDEO GAMES &amp; POP CULTURE!: </strong>We would like to extend our line to include images from your favorite video games and pop culture characters!</p>
<p>The $1000 is a minimum cost to get us started with the products listed above, if we go over our goal, we will be able to try out additional ideas that we have and buy MORE stock of the above listed materials!</p>
<h3>Here's What You'll Get!</h3>
<p>This is the fun part-- we are offering different prize perks for each donation tier! Here is what we are offering:</p>
<p><strong>You ROCK!</strong></p>
<p><strong>$1- </strong>For $1 I will personally send you an e-mail to remind you how awesome you are! ( You know, in case you forget) </p>

Custom Comix is a small family owned business that creates one-of-a-kind wearable pieces of comic book art. Every piece is made by hand and uses actual upcycled comic book / manga pages. We are the creators of the original comic book bracelets that have been on Etsy the past two years ( and counting!) 

Custom Comix is made up of 2 1/2 people. My name is Holly Donahue and I hand make every item in my shop. I am also in charge of packaging, running the online store and all of the online social networks associated with Custom Comix, and I love every second of it!
Ryan Grant is my boyfriend and he is in charge of shipping off all of the items to their new homes. He is also my main support system and helps come up with new ideas for the shop, as well as help keep me grounded when convention season is here. He is also the muscle that builds all of the displays at each convention.

My daughter Carmen ( or Batgirl as she demans to be called today) is 2 1/2 and helps where she can. Her tiny hands aren't ready to help me craft but that doesnt stop her from trying. She also helps to remind me why I do what I do everyday. She is my geekling in training and probably my biggest fan!
How Custom Comix Started:
If you are here and you know of my little shop, it is probably because you either are, or have a proud geek girl in your life. Have you tried shopping for her? 2 years ago when I opened up my shop, there was little to nothing out there for the geek girl to buy to flaunt her interets-- that was made with HER in mind. You couldn't go into Walmart to pick up a Tank Girl bracelet.. or anything Tank Girl for that matter. ( You still can't!) The fans of smaller fandoms were crying out for something for THEM but it wa falling on deaf ears. Coming back empty handed on a search for something for myself, I decided to just make something. Ryan joined in and that is how the comic book bracelet was born!
I was working full time at a bank and one of my clients loved my bracelet and told me about Etsy. I listed a couple of bracelets and found that I was not the only one frustrated with the selection of items available for geeky girls, and my shop took off! I was able to quit my bank job and stay home full time with my little one. 

We have come a long way since our first bracelet, and our line has really evolved since then. Two years ago we sold only bracelets and now we are able to offer earrings and most recently pendants in our line of products. I love being able to create unique items for amazing ladies and hearing their stories and seeing how happy my items make them really give me that drive to push the Custom Comix name. 
I would love to offer a broader range of items to meet the requests of my supporters. Recently, I put out a product survey and got a huge response-- You told us what you would like to see us cover and smother next, and we REALLY want to bring that to you! That's what brings us to Indiegogo... 
New Products You Say??
The goal amount that we need is $1000, and we plan on working for it. Here is a list of items and descriptions that we would love to offer in our shop. With $1000 we would be able to buy all of the pieces, machinery and tools needed to get us started with these new products. 

-RINGS!: Those of you who filled out our product survey, 90% of you suggested you would like to see rings for sale in our shop. The ones that we have our eye on are sterling silver in color, adjustable in size and like our pentants, they will have real glass placed on top of an image from a comic book to protect it. They will be round in shape and be 20mm in size.

-CUFFLINKS!: MEN!! We really want to include the men this time around. It is always so sad to see guys sulk away from our booth when we are at conventions, so it would be nice to be able to include them! These cufflinks would be similar to the rinfs that we would like to offer. They will be silver in color and have a comic book image covered with a piece of glass to protect it. I am undecided on the shape as of right now, square or circle-- but if we go over our goal, I can experiment with both! These cufflinks would be great for adding a bit of geek flare for the business men out there, or a great accessory for dances or weddings!
-MAGNETS/KEYCHAINS!: Right now, I do have pin back buttons, but I do not offer them in my etsy shop just yet. I want the ability to offer not only buttons, but the option for magnets and keychains! They would all measure 1 1/4 inches in length and be round in shape. 

-POCKET MIRRORS!: The pocket mirrors that we want are 2 1/4in big and will have a comic book image on one side which will be protected by a plastic casing similar to a very large pin back button and on the other side will be the mirror. These would be great to stash in your purse for emergencies!
-VIDEO GAMES & POP CULTURE!: We would like to extend our line to include images from your favorite video games and pop culture characters!
The $1000 is a minimum cost to get us started with the products listed above, if we go over our goal, we will be able to try out additional ideas that we have and buy MORE stock of the above listed materials!
Here's What You'll Get!
This is the fun part-- we are offering different prize perks for each donation tier! Here is what we are offering:

$10- For $10 you will receive a ring featuring the character of your choice! Each ring will be silver in color, round in shape and adjustable in size. It will have a glass top to protect the comic book image inside!

Wear A Hero Around Your Neck

Description
From a distance the sculpture looks like a tree or chandelier with strange translucent fruit or lighted pods suspended from stems radiating out from the center. 

Tree of Transmutation Sketch
The tree is made of fabricated steel branches that spring from the Playa and carry the suspended figures out from the center trunk.  Upon inspection the six pods appear to be female forms, two times life size, in various positions, suspended in space. 

Cocoons!
We have added a new feature to this project..Cocoons!  These suspended fabric cocoons will be hung between the branches so anyone can become fetal and emerge as the beautiful butterfly that they want to be.

Pyramid
In the center is a ten foot tall wooden pyramid pieced intricately together like the stonework of a Mayan wall.  The top is capped in three feet of copper plate with the tip intersecting a three-foot diameter ball of half life-size skeletons with a ten-inch iron version of the larger female figure suspended in the center.

Inner Core
The delicacy of the gesture appears as the figures rotate in their hanging positions. This sculpture engages a viewer from a distance, transforming as the figures interact on the Playa.

<p>What I am looking for is funding to support my first year in business.  I have a studio space in mind that has a very reasonable rent.  I found someone on Craig's List selling his late wife's ceramic studio - all equipment and supplies that I would need to get started.  I haven't even fully moved the equipment out of his house and have already made a sale!  I have many people - friends and acquaintences who have expressed interest in coming to my studio and I have a small amount of my recent work displayed on my Facebook page.  </p>
<p>Even if I don't reach my full goal, I will use the funds I do receive to get this studio opened.  The money I'm asking for is enough to cover rent and electricity for one year - and that's all.  I have most everything else I need.  I can find cheap or free tables and chairs on craig's list - preventing used furniture from ending up in landfills.  I don't need to spend a lot of money on fancy fixtures - that's not what this is about.  </p>
<p>I know I can create a warm, inviting space that people will want to come to.  I will have to start part time because I have to support myself - I'm a single mom who has raised 3 beautiful, successful daughters and now that they are all out on their own, I feel like I can do this and bring a little beauty to the world!  I have always been known as ""the cool mom"" because I keep up with current trends and have a contemporary style so my studio will be fresh and will draw all kinds of people.  </p>

<p>Even if you can't contribute financially, please spread the word for me!  Indiegogo has all the tools necessary to contribute to and/or share my cause.   My friends and family believe in me, and so do I!!  I can do this!  Any help will surely be appreciated.  Thank you for your time.  </p>

It's also geared towards providing assets for projects being developed for mobile platforms like iOS and Android, as well as PC/Mac builds. These assets are medium poly count, low bone count and have low texture overhead. I'll get into the nitty gritty technical details below.</p><p>What I'm hoping to achieve with this campaign is : Provide low cost assets to game developers for usage in their game development projects. At the same time I am hoping to fund my own hourly work on these assets and expand the collection to include all of the (4) skin texture variations and the (4) clothing variations.  This would allow for more than 32 different and unique zombie combinations.</p><p></p><h3>Technical Details</h3><p>3,321 polygons for Male Zombie Character Model</p><p>2,936 polygons for Female Zombie Character Model</p><p>1024 x 1024px Diffuse texture (both male and female)</p><p>1024 x 1024px Normal Map Texture (both male and female)</p><p>* Specular Map within the Alpha Channel of the Diffuse.</p><p>Character models are exported into FBX format, OBJ format (static models), and the source 3ds Max files. The FBX format will work in most major game engines used today.  Textures are offered as PSD files, with appropriately named layers, and overlay/color/pattern styles (for easy editing).</p><p></p><h3>Character Model Wireframe Previews</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/695855/files/20140705093221-MaleZombieWireframeTurnaround.gif?1404577941"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/695889/files/20140705095143-FemaleZombieWireframeTurnaround.gif?1404579103"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>I am hoping to fund my own hourly work on these assets and expand the collection to really give game developers a large pack of high quality assets.

</div></div>","Project Summary My name is James Arndt. I'm an established game developer based out of Central Florida. You can see my work at www.jamesarndt3d.com and check out a history of some of the games I've worked on.This campaign is based around the idea of bringing high quality assets to people for a very low price. It's also geared towards providing assets for projects being developed for mobile platforms like iOS and Android, as well as PC/Mac builds. These assets are medium poly count, low bone count and have low texture overhead. I'll get into the nitty gritty technical details below.What I'm hoping to achieve with this campaign is : Provide low cost assets to game developers for usage in their game development projects. At the same time I am hoping to fund my own hourly work on these assets and expand the collection to include all of the (4) skin texture variations and the (4) clothing variations.  This would allow for more than 32 different and unique zombie combinations.Technical Details3,321 polygons for Male Zombie Character Model2,936 polygons for Female Zombie Character Model1024 x 1024px Diffuse texture (both male and female)1024 x 1024px Normal Map Texture (both male and female)* Specular Map within the Alpha Channel of the Diffuse.Character models are exported into FBX format, OBJ format (static models), and the source 3ds Max files. The FBX format will work in most major game engines used today.  Textures are offered as PSD files, with appropriately named layers, and overlay/color/pattern styles (for easy editing).Character Model Wireframe PreviewsWhat I Need & What You Get I am hoping to fund my own hourly work on these assets and expand the collection to really give game developers a large pack of high quality assets. I can offer this at a very low cost due to the nature of crowdfunding. My goal is simple: financially cover the time spent working on these assets.
Now on to what you get!
(2) Base Character Models (Male and Female Versions)
(FBX format, and source 3ds Max file)
(4) Skin Texture Variations in layered PSD file format
(4) Clothing Variations (attached 3D Models/Skinned with Animation)

(FBX format, and source 3ds Max file)

(1) Unity Package File for each Perk Tier (one button Unity import)
(35) Unique Animations: 
(8) Walking Loop Animations
(6) Running Loop Animations
(6) Idle Loop Animations
(7) Attacking Animations
(8) Unique Eating, Getting Hit and Crawling Animations
* Animations are provided as ""in-place"" Legacy animations, as well as separate versions for Unity's Mecanim (including root motion for walk and run cycles.)
* I will also be including a Unity Package file for each perk tier. This will allow one button import into the Unity Game Engine, importing all of the assets at once.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Supreme Origins a not-for-profit group formed by a group of friends whose lasting friendships were built on their shared involvement and experiences of previous Sheffield Carnivals, which ran throughout the 1980’s to 1990’s.</p>
<p>The group perceive that cultural diversity is becoming more fragmented in the city, although cultural diversity is growing, and want to create and coordinate a carnival event that could bring people together, to share and celebrate the many cultures in Sheffield.</p>
<p>Most other cities have a carnival and we thought, why shouldn't we!</p>
<p>We are very excited to announce that <strong>Sheffield Carnival is launching at the Sheffield Fayre, taking place at Norfolk Heritage Park, on Monday 28th August 2017!</strong></p>
<p>The Carnival spirit has been missing from Sheffield for over 20 years and we are bringing it back with a bang.</p>
<p>The event will run alongside the Sheffield Fayre and will consist of a parade made up of children and people from the local community who will display their carnival costumes in the “Sheffield Shines” parade.  </p>
<p>The “Sheffield Shines” parade aims to celebrate everything Sheffield, the history, culture and heritage of Sheffield, what makes Sheffield unique and to showcase and celebrate the many cultures that reside in Sheffield.</p>
<p>2017 will be the first of what will be an annual event with a different theme each year.</p>
<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>theme for our very first carnival will be “Sheffield in Bloom</strong>”.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

<p>We will be running costume making workshops in the run up to the carnival and need your donations to help cover the cost of arts materials for our workshops.</p>
<p>We want to create beautiful vibrant costumes to show ""Sheffield in Bloom"" comprising of flowers, insects and plants in keeping with the Sheffield Fayre's Horticultural Show.</p>
<p><strong>This is where you could help!</strong></p>
<p>We are asking people to donate as much or as little as you can, to help us create some fabulous costumes.</p>
<p>It only takes ""£2 to Shine"" to support the ""Sheffield Shines"" parade.</p>
<p>We are suggesting people donate £2 (or more) and post a photo of yourself with the hashtag #2toShine on social media channels, to help Sheffield to Shine!</p>
<p>Any additional money we raise would be used towards expenses for artists and refreshments for the children taking part, any funds leftover will be rolled forward to next year.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Part of our vision is to encourage participation from the city and the wider region.  In order to achieve this we intend to engage with local people by providing workshops in local community centres, organisations and youth clubs.</p>

<h3>What are we up to this time?</h3>
<p>This year, Haute to Death is proud to be a featured collective for <a href=""http://satellite-show.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Satellite Art Show</a>, one of the more progressive and exuberant fairs that specializes in independent and emerging galleries, curators and artist lead projects.<br/><br/>While the visual works of Haute to Death will be on display, we've also included the work of respected creators and friends Lindsay Cashews, Jade Homicz, and John Griffith; artists who operate from their own self-actualized aesthetic universe, while simultaneously sharing<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> in our collective ethos, furthering the narrative and execution of this particular show.</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p>The concepts and spirit of the work in the show are those that are central to our parties; the internal exploration / external catharsis that club culture can have on ones identity and self-actualization. We have seen the affirmative power that a dance floor can have on people to feel safe to be themselves, as a space to transform and test the waters of new territories of their identity. It's a space that plays by different rules than those that preside over daylight hours. </p>
<p>We think it's very important and valuable for our family of creators; the artists, musicians and other creative professionals traveling along a similar path to us, who share a spirit and ethos with ours to be represented at these major industry gatherings. Through the help of our community, participating in these projects becomes a much more realistic and attainable goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What will help us succeed?</h3>
<p>As we know, taking on projects of any size requires more than passion. Time, energy, major organization efforts (seriously!) and initial funding are what actualize plans into the real deal. </p>
<p>For art fairs in particular, inclusion of independent projects is very rare. Not only are the opportunities for emerging or underground creators few and far between, but participation cost alone can be quite unrealistic for non-established, but fully worthy, artists and collectives.</p>
<p>We're thankful to have been selected by Satellite to represent our own facet of Detroit at this year's fair (and do not take the responsibility lightly!) Here's where your cash goes to help us make sure we do our best: </p>
<ul>
<li>$3000 covers participation and our booth at Satellite. While it may seem like a lot, this is only a fraction of what most fairs charge their participating galleries and curators. Satellite is the strongest choice to position our collective for relevant exposure and positive growth during Art Basel weekend. </li>
<li>$2000 covers production costs. Items like framing, lighting, packaging materials and shipping care, installation materials and other tools to make sure our 300 sq. foot booth shine as bright as it can.</li>
</ul>
<p>Honestly, that's about it. We've put in the work to make sure we get can get ourselves, our work, and our people down to Miami. Help recouping the cost of participating in Satellite is our primary need, and look to our community for a hand in doing so. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why is this so important?</h3>
<p>Detroit offers a lot for a creative quality of life, but very little for creators to elevate to higher echelons of the industry... So, we jump in and do it ourselves, taking agency over our collective narrative and the individual narratives of those who's work and well being are important and complimentary to our own. </p>
<p>Working with our community allows us to keep our vision uncompromised by the forces and demands associated with other forms of funding that support work like this. </p>
<p>Being able to stay true to our vision makes what we do impactful and intriguing. It comes from a real pocket of creativity and it helps people care and connect with the work and our stories that lead us there. When more people connect and buy into the work we raise the ceiling a little bit higher for what's possible in your career as a Detroit based creator. </p>
<p>We see the role we play in the bigger picture of Detroit and our creative community; improving that ecosystem and making a Detroit based creative career a little more viable for our cohort is very much a part of what drives us. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Anything else?</h3></div><div>
<p>Yes! We realize a financial contribution isn't always possible, and that's totally okay. We always need help getting the word out about not only this campaign, but the show itself!  </p>

</h3>for over a year now i have been practicing tarot and astrology, learning about herbs and herbal remedies, and for much longer i have been drawing. i've always played around with the idea of creating my own plant tarot deck, and now i finally feel like i know them well enough to get it done. i just need the start up money to get them printed....<br/>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>$800?!?!<br/>
</h3>this seems like a steep amount for a deck of cards? let's break it down<br/><br/><ul>
<li> <b>a tarot deck is 78 cards</b> (so this is 78 different cards, printed front and back in only ONE deck)</li>
<li>
<b>something to hold the cards </b>(simple tuck box is 25 cents a deck, or a pouch is another alternative)</li>
<li>

</div></div>","WHY?
for over a year now i have been practicing tarot and astrology, learning about herbs and herbal remedies, and for much longer i have been drawing. i've always played around with the idea of creating my own plant tarot deck, and now i finally feel like i know them well enough to get it done. i just need the start up money to get them printed....
  
$800?!?!
this seems like a steep amount for a deck of cards? let's break it down
 a tarot deck is 78 cards (so this is 78 different cards, printed front and back in only ONE deck)

something to hold the cards (simple tuck box is 25 cents a deck, or a pouch is another alternative)

shipping ($60-90 depending on the amount of decks ordered)

50-100 decks (the more you order the cheaper the cost of printing!)

and if we raise more, it would go towards more add ons - like gold foil printing on the tuck box, or a tarot card booklet to go along with it.
  
WHAT DO YOU GET?

<p><strong>DECIMALS REBUILT- HYPURITIDE<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>ONLY ONE GALLERY<br/></strong>September 21, 2013<br/>Toronto, Canada<br/></strong></p>
<p>My name is Evond Blake also known as <strong>MEDIAH</strong>. I’ve been an active graffiti artist since 1994 and since then I have transitioned into the world of media art using animation, graphics, and contemporary art. My work is labeled as Futurist or avant-garde because of the unconventional structure of my style. I define my work as Dynamism because of my unrelenting obsession with dynamic forms, speed, light and reaction.</p>
<p>HYPURITIDE is the 6th Installment of my mega-series of solo shows entitled DECIMALS REBUILT. The intention is to create visually stunning artwork that blurs the lines between new media practices, contemporary art, and the gritty, edgy aesthetic of graffiti art to create a unique experience that moves both spirit and mind.</p>
<p>YOU as the contributor can help me bring this amazing new world into existence. This show will be a catalyst for Decimals Rebuilt to be shown internationally.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Space rental- $2000 (two week rental with opening and closing receptions)<br/> Projection equipment rental -$1300<br/> Installation costs -$600<br/> Promotional materials -$400</p>
<p><strong>Perks (What YOU get)</strong></p>
<p>For every contribution of $25 or more you will receive a custom giclée print on archival watercolor paper signed and numbered by me personally. The smallest prints have a value of $40 on their own, but these prints are special as they will not be available for sale anywhere else.</p>
<p><strong>$10 - OFFICIAL SUPPORTER + name on revamped web site + hand written thank you card + DECIMALS REBUILT Wallpaper<br/></strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p>If I don't reach the goal of $4300, the donated funds will be prioritized into space rental and rental of projection equipment. For the past six years I have been investing my own funds and I will continue to do so as I cannot rest until I see this project through to its full completion.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>My intention is for each and every viewer to walk away from the show feeling spiritually awakened and inspired, like never before at another art show. To date DECIMALS REBUILT has been exposed to thousands of viewers across Canada with animation components featured in the Currents International New Festival in Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Outside of a donation, you can help this project by spreading the word about this fundraising campaign on facebook, instagram, twitter, on blogs, web sites and by word of mouth. Also, if you have any connections to technology sponsors (for LED, LCD TVs, and HD projectors) please get in touch with me.

<p><strong><br/></strong>PY // Art From Parkland's Youth is an art exhibition featuring local high school students in Parkland, WA being put on by Sarah Wise. Sarah holds a BFA in Graphic Design from Pacific Lutheran University in her home town of Parkland. She is currently working towards her MA in Arts Administration from the Savannah College of Art and Design, and this is her final project for that degree. The purpose of this show is to build positive community relationships through art. The students of the local Franklin Pierce School District's two high schools will submit their own original artwork to a jury comprised of PLU students, who will determine which pieces go on display in the Wekell Gallery at PLU. The community will then be invited to a weekend-long exhibition featuring this artwork, showcasing the creative talent found right here in Parkland.</p>
<h2><strong>PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth Business Sponsorship</strong></h2>
<p>Businesses may contribute to PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth in a variety of ways. The following are suggested levels of participation.

Promotion will include a special thank you to the business and a link to that business’ website (or phone number for businesses that do not have online presence).</p>
<p><strong>Businesses making a donation of $75 or more</strong> will automatically receive space in the Sponorship section of the gallery program, which will be distributed to viewers during the show. This is in addition to promotion online through the social media campaign.</p>
<p><span>Participation</span></p>
<p>Businesses are also encouraged to participate with promoting the show amongst the Parkland community. There are endless possibilities for how a business may participate in the show. Here are some suggested ways to participate:</p>
<p><strong>Feature student artwork in your place of business.</strong> Artwork is a great way to liven up any space, and what better way than to feature artwork from local high school students? Artwork may be installed in your place of business, along with the artists’ name, school, year in school, and information about the PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth exhibition at PLU. Here are the details:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may feature just one piece or however many you’d like, depending on availability</li>
<li>Your business will be included as a sponsoring business in the social media campaign online as well as in the printed gallery program at the show</li>
</ul><p><strong>Allow promotion of the show.</strong> If you don’t have the space to host artwork, another option may be placing flyers advertising the show in your business. We simply ask that you place at least one flyer in a visible place that will attract customer attention. Do you have a community bulletin board? What about your shop window? Inform the community about the upcoming show, and show that your business is involved with the community and the arts. Here are the specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post at least one flyer; we are happy to provide more at your request</li>
<li>Your business will be included as a sponsoring business in the social media campaign and will receive special thanks at the gallery show (please note: special thanks will be verbal during a speech for the gallery opening. This is not the same as being featured in the sponsors section of the printed program) </li>
</ul><p><strong>Post a link to the show’s Facebook page or blog on your business’ website.</strong> We’re happy to accept a little web traffic from your customers! You can raise awareness by featuring a link on your website and informing the community about this unique opportunity. Here are the specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Place a link to the show’s Facebook page or blog</li>
<li>We will link back to your business in our sponsors section online</li>
</ul><p>Because the purpose of this project is to build community relationships, any form of contribution to the cause is welcomed! If none of these options match your business’ needs, please reach out to Sarah Wise at <a href=""mailto:wise.sarahe@gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">wise.sarahe@gmail.com</a> to discuss other options. Together, we will find the perfect relationship for your business to support this project. Thank you!</p></div>","About The Project

The students of the local Franklin Pierce School District's two high schools will submit their own original artwork to a jury comprised of PLU students, who will determine which pieces go on display in the Wekell Gallery at PLU. The community will then be invited to a weekend-long exhibition featuring this artwork, showcasing the creative talent found right here in Parkland.
PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth Business Sponsorship
Businesses may contribute to PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth in a variety of ways. The following are suggested levels of participation. Local businesses wishing to support the Parkland community and this project are encouraged to do so in any way they see fit. For more information about the PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth project, Like us on Facebook at facebook.com/pyartshow.
Donations
Monetary donations are accepted. Contributions in any amount will be accepted. Funds will go towards the following:

Catering for the gallery’s opening night
Printing of all promotional materials for the show
Art supplies to help students prepare their work for the gallery space
Art-related prizes for students winning 1st, 2nd, and 3rd prizes
Any additional funds at the end of this project will be donated to the Franklin Pierce School District for arts education
Businesses making a donation of $30 or more will receive promotion as a “featured sponsor” in the PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth social media campaign. Promotion will include a special thank you to the business and a link to that business’ website (or phone number for businesses that do not have online presence).
Businesses making a donation of $75 or more will automatically receive space in the Sponorship section of the gallery program, which will be distributed to viewers during the show. This is in addition to promotion online through the social media campaign.
Participation
Businesses are also encouraged to participate with promoting the show amongst the Parkland community. There are endless possibilities for how a business may participate in the show. Here are some suggested ways to participate:
Feature student artwork in your place of business. Artwork is a great way to liven up any space, and what better way than to feature artwork from local high school students? Artwork may be installed in your place of business, along with the artists’ name, school, year in school, and information about the PY // Art From Parkland’s Youth exhibition at PLU. Here are the details:

You may feature just one piece or however many you’d like, depending on availability
Your business will be included as a sponsoring business in the social media campaign online as well as in the printed gallery program at the show
Allow promotion of the show. If you don’t have the space to host artwork, another option may be placing flyers advertising the show in your business. We simply ask that you place at least one flyer in a visible place that will attract customer attention. Do you have a community bulletin board? What about your shop window? Inform the community about the upcoming show, and show that your business is involved with the community and the arts. Here are the specifics:

Post at least one flyer; we are happy to provide more at your request
Your business will be included as a sponsoring business in the social media campaign and will receive special thanks at the gallery show (please note: special thanks will be verbal during a speech for the gallery opening. This is not the same as being featured in the sponsors section of the printed program) 
Post a link to the show’s Facebook page or blog on your business’ website. We’re happy to accept a little web traffic from your customers! You can raise awareness by featuring a link on your website and informing the community about this unique opportunity. Here are the specifics:

Place a link to the show’s Facebook page or blog
We will link back to your business in our sponsors section online
Because the purpose of this project is to build community relationships, any form of contribution to the cause is welcomed! If none of these options match your business’ needs, please reach out to Sarah Wise at wise.sarahe@gmail.com to discuss other options. Together, we will find the perfect relationship for your business to support this project. Thank you!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p class=""MsoNormal"">Introduction:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">What is NELAart? Northeast Los Angeles Arts Organization.
And where is it? Northeast Los Angeles includes Mount Washington, Highland
Park, Eagle Rock, Cyprus Park and Glassell<span style="""">  </span>Park. This area of Los Angeles has some of the city's most
diverse collection of artists and a rich history of being an arts
community. There are more and more creative artists moving here everyday. Weâ€™re
surrounded by fine and commercial artists, designers and architects, musicians
and performers, and as more move into the area they find kindred spiritsâ€¦ and a
community that celebrates the arts.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The area has been a home for arts and crafts for quite
awhile and itâ€™s having a resurgence. Itâ€™s only getting better. Thatâ€™s where
NELAart comes in. It was founded over 6 years ago by Brian Mallman and a small
group of gallery owners and artists who wanted to show art and bring attention
to the area as a center for arts. Second Saturday was started and has been
running continuously since. Galleries and artists come and go but the monthly
event lives on. It has given artists a place to show and arts enthusiasts a place
to see local art. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">THE Meat:</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Now NELAart is ready to take it to the next levelâ€¦weâ€™re
currently in the process of turning it into a non-profit. Fresh events are being
put together to bring more artists, galleries, and collectors and potential
collectors together. Itâ€™s about connecting people to art and art to people. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This brings me to why Iâ€™m here at Indie GoGo talking to all
of you. The process of transformation requires funding. And Indie GoGo is one
of the places weâ€™re going to to assist the start up process for NELAart. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">What are some of the things NELAart is planning to do you
may askâ€¦we want to spread the word about the arts in this area. We want to
assist artists with the things they may need help with such as applying for
commissions or putting together a portfolio. There will be grants, in fact
weâ€™ve already started a micro-grant program that gives artists cash. Itâ€™s based
on the live micro-grant funding model thatâ€™s sweeping the nation. Artists present projects to patrons that have bought tickets, and in most cases enjoyed
a little food and drink, and those patrons vote on the project they like best.
The winner receives the money from the ticket sales. Itâ€™s crowd funding
like Indie GoGo but it happens right in front of you. We also are planning indie film nights and literary salons, performance
and music events, pop up galleries and we're helping to bring more arts to the local
schools. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>
<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As an organization we also want to be able to provide
information to the arts community such as calls for art, business oriented
classes and lectures, insurance, and some of the things most artists cannot always access. All of this requires staff and that requires funding.
Weâ€™re not asking for the world, just some start up dollars. And there are
goodies to help encourage you to give us some assistance. </p>

<p>Hi, my name is Jairo, I studied Aerospace Engineering and have a degree in Film School from the Dutch Film Academy. After school I started working as a freelancer  and worked as a visual effects artist on commercials.</p>
<p>When I had the idea of shooting 3d movies with my iPhone I started to prototype and it worked. My challenge is to find a cheap way to let you guys participate. Unfortunately it is not as simple as installing an app from the app store. You need a way to physically record two images with a slightly different perspective.</p>
<p>I used 3d modelling software to figure out the dimensions. The final design is a combination of a single piece of cardboard and four metal parts. The app for shooting the movies is already in the app store.</p>

<h1> </h1>
<h1>Fund me!</h1>
<p>With the money now available, I investigated a good printing company which can deliver sturdy 400 grams laminated cardboard, it is very good for the model. Also there are two mirror plates underway from China, awesome!</p>
<p>Now I have to figure out how to further produce. Cutting thin metal sheet precisely is annoyingly hard to do and therefore very expensive. Also the cutting plan for the paper is pretty complex. </p>
<p>I need money to work this out, visit fabrication labs to develop my prototyping skills and even batch produce the parts needed myself if need. These are the perks I have on offer:</p>

<p>So plan A is get a group of people interested to try this invention of mine and use their money to work out the production of the models. I will keep everyone up to date on my decisions and make photo's etc. After that I will try to really kickstart this baby and find some crazy Japanese market to sell a million Woolfs.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Brian Lee, grandson of Betty and Calvin Douglas, and I have created this campaign to get funding to provide a trip of lifetime for my grandparents. I am going to take these civil rights soldiers to the inauguration to see their efforts come full circle. At 95 and soon to be 88 they will only get this shot at seeing the first African American President inaugurated, since we missed the first one. I have been blessed to have them in my life and owe them so much that this is the least I can do. With age and illness taking its toll my window to pay my gratitude is running out. These two individuals are a bit of living history and believe that they should see this event. Without them and others like them we would not have the country that we know today.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The first $10000 raised will go to providing proper transportation, lodging and healthcare. My stretch goal is to raise $100000 and film a documentary of their life experiences and trip to the inauguration. Everyone that donates will mentioned in the documentary once we get to our stretch goal.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The project is important to our society for a number of reasons. The people who fought in the civil rights movement harnessed a desire to make this country better. They struggled for equality in a world that wasn’t. We cannot forget what made us who we are today and therefore we need to see their story. </p>

<h3>What Is The ""Angel Experience"" -Healing Art Journal?</h3>
<p>The, ""Angel Experience"" – Healing Art Journal takes you on a self guided journey along a spiritual path forged from messages provided by the cosmos on the night of 11-11-2011. <span>Each of the messages provided in this beautiful journal unfolding each pf the steps showing you the steps to break through the barriers that stand in the way as you learn to reshape and redefine your true values and goals so you may meet for the first time... YOU.  </span></p>
<p>Sure we can question receiving messages from the cosmic universe, nevertheless the messages are here. There are no coincidences the clarity of these messages have come at this point in time. As you can see through Robyne's <a href=""http://www.robynearrow.com/who-is-robyne.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">background</a> and her ability to overcome the odds you know she value's inner strength and awareness unlike anything else. Her truth has allowed her to overcome the impossible not just once rather numerous times. You can be assured the Angel Experience is of great significance to the whole.</p>
<p>The ""Angel Experience"" in its physical form is a coffee tabletop art book and journal featuring the works of eleven, very talented artists who are working with Robyne to bring alive eleven main art (11"" by 14"") paintings from the photo's taken on the night of 11-11-2011. Additionally, there are other talented doodle-art artists and illustrators who will complete the 121 (11"" by 14"") doodle art illustrations. These illustrations support the eleven main art paintings allowing the journalers to work right along side the messages captured on the night of 11-11-2011.</p>
<p>The ""Angel Experience"" Healing Art Journal has great appeal for those who desire nothing more than to embrace their inner knowing and want their soul to lead the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who Is Robyne Arrow?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the story finds the storyteller. In the case of the ""Angel Experience"" the story teller is <a href=""http://www.robynearrow.com/who-is-robyne.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Robyne Arrow</a>.</p>
<p>On 11/11/11, while walking her dogs at night, Robyne was moved to capture photos of the night sky. When Robyne finally reviewed the photos weeks after they were taken, she realized her camera had captured something magical – see a few for yourself! </p>
<p>The first few photos into the series of photos on the night of 11-11-2011 portrays the importance of finding stillness in the midst of chaos. The photos then show the power of how various thoughts can either expand your inner soul to awaken or contract you back to your old ways. With the acknowledgement of understanding which thoughts are what you are lead into oneness. What is Oneness? Nothing more than connecting self with one's higher source.</p>
<p>The messages and the step by step process the bearer of light within the cosmos has provided are beyond powerful. It truly is amazing to see how Oneness forms through the power of thought:</p>

<p><strong>Fertility Of Oneness</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Immediately after the ""Fertility Of Oneness"" photo an Angel appears in the sky as if she has just been born. To sense the mystery of the angels is to touch the inner soul.</p>

<h3>A Little Bit More About The Project:</h3>
<p>Since realizing the artistic healing and inner awakening potential these messages have provided on the night of 11/11/11, Robyne has poured her heart and soul into authoring the journal chapters, which are now complete. She has also reached out to the artistic community to pave the way for exceptional works of art supporting the messages from the angel experience. This outreach has taken a life of its own and now she is working with various artists around the world to bring the photos and their messages to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Here is one of the original photos taken on 11-11-2011:</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""11-11-2011"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/14397_231258167005780_727970244_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Angel / Cherub""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>and here you see how the photo is brought to life in full living expression and color as represented in the following final production;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Angel Experience Healing Art Journal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/556881_231414336990163_199713505_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Angel Experience Healing Art Journal""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here they are both side to side, so you may see how the Angel is being brought to life first hand.</p>

<p>As you can see this is a very unique and inspiring project.  </p>
<p>Receiving these messages on the night of 11-11-2011 at exactly 11 PM is a miracle all on its own. Bringing these messages to life will be an even greater miracle. Robyne cannot do this type of project on her own. The Angel Experience is a big project. There are three steps that must be completed before the project can go to production.</p>
<p>The first step, Robyne has completed which entails authoring the messages for each of the eleven chapters that make up the Healing Art Journal. </p>
<p>The second step is where Robyne needs your support. Your contribution will help Robyne hire various talented and beloved artists to reproduce eleven of the original raw photos into 11 inches by 14 inches healing paintings using various paint, pen and pencil as shown in the above photo. Whatever you choose to contribute Robyne can assure you your support will be worth every cent.</p>
<p>The third step entails creating up to 120 doodle art illustrations providing an inspiring environment to journal one's intimate thoughts along with illustrations to color in with various forms of paints, water color, pencil or ink to express through another outlet.  This is what makes up the Healing Art Journal. </p>
<p>In the end, every page is a surprise, every page brings light onto your journey of self discovery. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Robyne's Funding Goals:</h3>
<p><strong>Goal 1</strong>: $2750.00 </p>
<ul>
<li>11-paintings sized 11"" by 14"" </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Goal 2</strong>: $7180.00</p>
<ul>
<li>121-doodle art illustrations sized 11"" by 14"" </li>
<li>9% of funds go to the campaign fees</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Reason For More Than One Funding Goal:</h3>
<p>Anything raised above our first goal will help us to complete the 121 pieces of doodle art illustration. The bigger the budget, the more impressive the art journal will be. Like many projects on Indiegogo, Robyne is not here to get rich, but to have an opportunity to create and share beautiful, inspiring artwork for the Healing Art Journal combined with unique, one of a kind messages taken from the night of 11-11-2011. </p>
<p>To lose out on creating this unique, one of a kind healing art journal would be a major loss to those who are looking for an avenue that will guide them to the answers they seek. The best part is this is not a man-made production rather a unique, one of a kind,  celestial gift.</p>
<p>Of course we have big dreams and goals! This project is not only about creating the artwork for the ""Angel Experience"" - Healing Arts Journal, but is also about inspiring and uplifting others while sharing Robyne’s story and experience with those who desire a greater sense of inner awareness. This is an incredibly uplifting and exciting project for all involved.</p>
<p>Your support will help us create all the art work necessary to complete the ""Angel Experience"" a healing art journal table top book containing eleven major photos including 121 pages of unique, and rare, art doodle illustrations. </p>
<p>Any additional funds collected from this campaign will go towards creating eleven, 22"" X 24"" canvas paintings taken from the main themed 11"" X 14"" paintings for the ""Angel Experience"" healing art journal. These canvas paintings will then allow Robyne to do an eleven city tour where she will share the Angel Experience messages through art exhibits beginning National Angels Day in August 2013.</p>
<p>We really hope you can help contribute towards making this healing art journal available worldwide to individuals who value the importance of allowing their soul to lead the way. </p>

<h2><strong>AN INNOVATIVE RESEARCH AND CREATION PROJECT IN DIGITAL ARTS</strong></h2>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></strong></h3>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who are we ? The most amazing team !</span></strong></h3>
<p>This project emerged from the encounter of brilliant established creators and dynamic emerging artists. Internationally acclaimed new media artists Isabelle Choinière and Ricardo Dal Farra, with scenographer and lighting designer Audrey-Anne Bouchard gathered an amazing team of collaborators together for this project’s realization. The great combination of knowledgeable and experienced new media artists with wildly creative and innovative younger spirits brings an incredible richness to our creative process.</p>
<p>To this day, over thirty people (artists, producers, promoters, researchers, programmers) are involved in this great project. Everyone is extremely competent and deeply committed to the research. Coming from media arts, dance, visual arts, electro acoustics, our team finds its strength in its multidisciplinarity. In a collective dynamic, we each bring our own expertise and sensitivity to the emergence of a unique artistic form.</p>
<p><em>**Watch the video for the project's complete credits</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The artistic project : an immersive <em>Collective Body</em></span></strong></h3>
<p>We believe that technologies, when integrated in a performative context, hold the potential to go beyond the spectacular and lead to deeper research. Therefore, in this research project, we are asking ourselves: <strong>how can technologies alter or even enrich the performer and the spectator’s sensorial experience ?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently exploring this idea in the creation of a dance and digital arts performance/installation entitled <em>Collective Body</em>. On stage, five female dancers, bodies intertwined, form a human sculpture in constant movement, a <em>Collective Body</em>. Bodies and breaths tangle, the dancers are simultaneously five bodies and one same mass. Before the spectator’s eye, our sound composer will be managing the live mediatisation of the dancers’ vocal expressions into digital sound. Those sounds will then be transformed and spatialized in real time around the spectators, integrating them in the sound installation, in the <em>Collective Body</em> itself.</p>
<p>This means that, as a spectator of our piece, you are sitting, not in front of the show, but <em>in</em> the performance. You become part of the installation itself. Not only can you see, from very close, the five performers moving in a unique and original way, but you can also hear their voices and feel them traveling all around you. We want this performance to be a surprising <strong>multisensorial experience</strong> for you, one that is perceptible by much more than only sight.</p>
<h3><strong>Art is about taking risks</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to use sound spatialization to blur your sense of space. We wish to invite you to share with us the risk of losing our stage conventions and sensory reference points, to reinvent together our common experience of this encounter that is <em>performance</em>.</p>
<h3><strong>Intimacy at the digital era</strong></h3>
<p>In the evanescence of this digital world, we sometimes lose the physical contact with the other. In our creation, we want to stage the presence of flesh, the human mass in its material and interconnected dimension. In the performance, the dancers are constantly touching each other, caring for each other. We believe that intimacy can be found in an environment inhabited by technology. The sound device that we are developing will be used not to transform the women’s voices into techno-like sounds, but rather to make their chant and breaths travel in space and envelop the spectator in this intimacy. We wish to state that “high tech” performance, beyond spectacular, can also be personal and touching.</p>

<h3><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Qui sommes nous ? Une équipe extraordinaire !</span></strong></h3>
<p>Ce projet est né de la rencontre de brillants créateurs établis et de jeunes artistes dynamiques. Les artistes Isabelle Choinière et Ricardo Dal Farra, internationalement reconnus pour leurs œuvres en arts et technologies, ainsi qu’Audrey-Anne Bouchard, scénographe et conceptrice d’éclairages, ont rassemblé une équipe de collaborateurs tous plus extraordinaires les uns que les autres, afin de réaliser ce grand projet. La combinaison gagnante du savoir et de l’expérience d’artistes chevronnés avec la créativité débridée et l’esprit novateur de plus jeunes créateurs, enrichie énormément notre processus de création.</p>
<p>À ce jour, plus d’une trentaine de personnes (artistes, producteurs, chercheurs, programmeurs) sont impliqués dans ce grand projet. Tous sont extrêmement compétents et profondément engagés dans la recherche. Provenant de la danse, des arts médiatiques, des arts visuels et de l’électroacoustique, notre équipe trouve sa force dans sa multidisciplinarité. Dans une dynamique collective, chacun d’entre nous apporte sa propre expertise et sa sensibilité à l’émergence d’un langage artistique unique.</p>

<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Le projet artistique : Un <em>Corps Collectif</em> immersif</span></strong></h3>
<p>Nous croyons que les technologies numériques, lorsqu’elles sont intégrées à l’espace performatif, peuvent dépasser l’effet spectaculaire dans une recherche plus approfondie. Dans le cadre de notre projet de recherche, nous explorons la question suivante : <strong>comment les technologies peuvent-elles altérer, voire enrichir l’expérience sensorielle du performeur et du spectateur ?</strong></p>
<p>Nous explorons actuellement cette idée à travers la création d’une performance/installation en arts numériques intitulée <em>Corps Collectif.</em><em> </em>Sur scène, cinq performeuses aux corps entremêlés, forment une sculpture humaine tridimensionnelle en mouvement constant : un <em>Corps Collectif</em>. Les corps et les souffles s’entrelacent, les performeuses sont à la fois cinq corps et une même masse. Sous les yeux des spectateurs, le compositeur sonore performe la médiatisation en direct des expressions vocales des performeuses en information audio numérique. Ces sons sont ensuite transformés puis spatialisés en temps-réel autour des spectateurs, intégrant ceux-ci à l’intérieur de l’installation sonore, à même le <em>Corps Collectif</em>.</p>
<p>Concrètement, cela implique que vous, spectateurs de notre création, prenez place, non pas en face de l’action, mais bien sur la scène, dans la performance. Vous faites partie de l’installation. Non seulement pouvez-vous observer de très près les cinq performeuses dessiner des mouvements originaux et uniques, mais vous pouvez également entendre leurs voix, les sentir voyager tout autour de vous. Nous voulons que cette performance soit une <strong>expérience multisensorielle</strong> surprenante pour vous, une expérience perceptible bien au-delà du seul sens de la vue.</p>
<h3><strong>L’art c’est prendre des risques</strong></h3>
<p>Notre objectif est d’utiliser la spatialisation sonore pour troubler vos repères dans l’espace. Nous vous invitons à prendre avec nous le risque de perdre nos conventions scéniques afin de réinventer ensemble notre expérience commune de cette rencontre dite <em>performance</em>.</p>
<h3><strong>L’intimité à l’ère du numérique</strong></h3>
<p>Dans l’évanescence du monde numérique, nous perdons parfois le contact physique avec l’autre. Dans notre création, nous voulons mettre en scène la présence de la chair, de la masse humaine dans sa dimension matérielle et interconnectée. Au cours de la performance, les danseuses se touchent constamment, prenant soin l’une de l’autre. Nous souhaitons donner sa place à l’intimité dans un environnement scénique habité par le numérique. Le dispositif sonore que nous développons nous servira non pas à transformer les voix des filles en sons techno-robotiques, mais plutôt à faire voyager leurs chants et leurs respirations pour envelopper le spectateur dans cette intimité. Nous voulons affirmer ainsi que les performances  “high tech”, au-delà du spectaculaire, peuvent également êtres personnelles et touchantes.</p>

AN INNOVATIVE RESEARCH AND CREATION PROJECT IN DIGITAL ARTS
 
Who are we ? The most amazing team !
This project emerged from the encounter of brilliant established creators and dynamic emerging artists. Internationally acclaimed new media artists Isabelle Choinière and Ricardo Dal Farra, with scenographer and lighting designer Audrey-Anne Bouchard gathered an amazing team of collaborators together for this project’s realization. The great combination of knowledgeable and experienced new media artists with wildly creative and innovative younger spirits brings an incredible richness to our creative process.
To this day, over thirty people (artists, producers, promoters, researchers, programmers) are involved in this great project. Everyone is extremely competent and deeply committed to the research. Coming from media arts, dance, visual arts, electro acoustics, our team finds its strength in its multidisciplinarity. In a collective dynamic, we each bring our own expertise and sensitivity to the emergence of a unique artistic form.
**Watch the video for the project's complete credits
 
The artistic project : an immersive Collective Body
We believe that technologies, when integrated in a performative context, hold the potential to go beyond the spectacular and lead to deeper research. Therefore, in this research project, we are asking ourselves: how can technologies alter or even enrich the performer and the spectator’s sensorial experience ?
We are currently exploring this idea in the creation of a dance and digital arts performance/installation entitled Collective Body. On stage, five female dancers, bodies intertwined, form a human sculpture in constant movement, a Collective Body. Bodies and breaths tangle, the dancers are simultaneously five bodies and one same mass. Before the spectator’s eye, our sound composer will be managing the live mediatisation of the dancers’ vocal expressions into digital sound. Those sounds will then be transformed and spatialized in real time around the spectators, integrating them in the sound installation, in the Collective Body itself.
This means that, as a spectator of our piece, you are sitting, not in front of the show, but in the performance. You become part of the installation itself. Not only can you see, from very close, the five performers moving in a unique and original way, but you can also hear their voices and feel them traveling all around you. We want this performance to be a surprising multisensorial experience for you, one that is perceptible by much more than only sight.
Art is about taking risks
Our goal is to use sound spatialization to blur your sense of space. We wish to invite you to share with us the risk of losing our stage conventions and sensory reference points, to reinvent together our common experience of this encounter that is performance.
Intimacy at the digital era
In the evanescence of this digital world, we sometimes lose the physical contact with the other. In our creation, we want to stage the presence of flesh, the human mass in its material and interconnected dimension. In the performance, the dancers are constantly touching each other, caring for each other. We believe that intimacy can be found in an environment inhabited by technology. The sound device that we are developing will be used not to transform the women’s voices into techno-like sounds, but rather to make their chant and breaths travel in space and envelop the spectator in this intimacy. We wish to state that “high tech” performance, beyond spectacular, can also be personal and touching.

We have been chosen to open the international digital arts festival CYNETART in Germany !

<h3><strong>Project Summary</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign will fund the creation of an art book of ‘Discoveries: Montreal’ by Denise Buisman Pilger. Discoveries: Montreal is a visual arts project that I have been working on for the past two years, it features all the boroughs on the island of Montreal. The book will have a total of 96 pages, showcasing all the pieces in the series as well as detailed information about the artist and the creation of the project. Contribute to this amazing book now!

<h3><strong>Artist Bio</strong></h3>
<p>Although based in Montreal, visual artist Denise Buisman Pilger is a frequent globe-trotter, gathering inspiration for her urban photo-collages along the way.  Exhibiting and selling her work prolifically in North America and Europe over the past several years, one of the highlights was a trip to Paris to participate in the ‘2011 Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Art’ at the Carrousel du Louvre.</p>
<p>Her creative practice spans more than a decade, beginning with several years as a professional graphic designer and art director for print media, both in Europe and North America.  This sensibility is reflected in her current body of work both aesthetically and technically.  From her home-based studio, she produces city-scapes that are graphic, contemporary and yet, nostalgic. </p>
<p>Originally from the Netherlands, Denise has a Bachelor of Arts in Illustration from Willem de Kooning Academy of Arts in Rotterdam, and continues to pursue creative professional development to stay on top of new techniques and materials.  She occasionally offers artist talks and technique classes in her community. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/830936/pictures/full/20130525115643-Exhibitis_600.jpg?1369508205"" src="""" style="""" title=""Selected Exhibits""/> </p>
<h3><strong>Artist Statement</strong></h3>
<p>Denise’s work reflects her love of photography, painting and travel configured into graphic pseudo-realities of everyday life filtered through her own whimsical creative lens. Her tableaux are bustling, surreal pastiches of -architectural elements and city life, arranged at unusual angles, irregular scale and not necessarily in their true-to-life configuration. </p>
<p>Her creative process involves digital photo manipulation, image transfer, acrylic photo collage, acrylic paints/-mediums, and other innovative techniques.  Working in a variety of scale, Denise creates panels that are graphic, contemporary and yet somehow nostalgic.  Often her pieces are black and white with minimalist colour accents, while others abound with colour - her visual vocabulary always unique and always authentic.</p>
<p>In her most recent series – Discoveries: Montreal - Denise explores each of the island city’s 34 boroughs.  Venturing out (camera in hand) she has captured the iconic and quirky details that make every borough unique, turning each into a one-of-a-kind mixed media panel.  The series offers a rare insight into the distinct flavors of all the ‘little villages’ that make up the island’s rich landscape.</p>
<p>Merging many photographs into a singular image, Denise’s unique impressions of the city capture the urban landscape through the eyes of a new resident, highlighting the often mundane, yet essential elements that make up the living, breathing and evolving ecosystem of the city she has called home since 2009.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Spread from the book"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/830349/pictures/full/20130525013030-Book_setup_600.jpg?1369470635"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>About the book</strong></h3>
<p>Discoveries: Montreal is a 'series' and although all the pieces can be enjoyed on their own, they are more powerful as a whole. With original artwork being quite expensive, the individual pieces will probably be sold off separately after the initial showing. This art book will be a way to keep the series together and it will make it possible for people to enjoy the entire series at home for years to come.</p>
<p>This 96page book will be perfect bound with minimalist graphic design, featuring only one piece on each spread so each piece gets full attention. The book will also contain information about the artist and the project and some insights in the creation process. This book will look great on your bookshelf or on you coffee table and will make a great conversation starter.</p>
<p>I am currently working on the final pieces, the series is expected to be finished by the end of June 2013. The text for the book is in the editing phase and the graphic design has been started as well. The book will be in both French and in English, just like the city the project is based on. The publishing date for the book depends on the time needed for photography, translation, proof reading and printing, but it has tentatively been set for early September 2013. Keep an eye on the updates for information on the creation of the book and the final pieces of the series. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Where will your money go?</strong></h3>
<p>This is a fixed campaign so you will only be charged if the campaign succeeds. The funds raised will be used to cover the costs of producing the book. It will pay for things like photographing the artwork, proofreading, editing, translation and printing of the book.</p>

</div></div>","Project Summary
This campaign will fund the creation of an art book of ‘Discoveries: Montreal’ by Denise Buisman Pilger. Discoveries: Montreal is a visual arts project that I have been working on for the past two years, it features all the boroughs on the island of Montreal. The book will have a total of 96 pages, showcasing all the pieces in the series as well as detailed information about the artist and the creation of the project. Contribute to this amazing book now! Help Denise raise funds and claim your reward on the right hand side!
 
Artist Bio
Although based in Montreal, visual artist Denise Buisman Pilger is a frequent globe-trotter, gathering inspiration for her urban photo-collages along the way.  Exhibiting and selling her work prolifically in North America and Europe over the past several years, one of the highlights was a trip to Paris to participate in the ‘2011 Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux-Art’ at the Carrousel du Louvre.
Her creative practice spans more than a decade, beginning with several years as a professional graphic designer and art director for print media, both in Europe and North America.  This sensibility is reflected in her current body of work both aesthetically and technically.  From her home-based studio, she produces city-scapes that are graphic, contemporary and yet, nostalgic. 
Originally from the Netherlands, Denise has a Bachelor of Arts in Illustration from Willem de Kooning Academy of Arts in Rotterdam, and continues to pursue creative professional development to stay on top of new techniques and materials.  She occasionally offers artist talks and technique classes in her community. 
 
Artist Statement
Denise’s work reflects her love of photography, painting and travel configured into graphic pseudo-realities of everyday life filtered through her own whimsical creative lens. Her tableaux are bustling, surreal pastiches of -architectural elements and city life, arranged at unusual angles, irregular scale and not necessarily in their true-to-life configuration. 
Her creative process involves digital photo manipulation, image transfer, acrylic photo collage, acrylic paints/-mediums, and other innovative techniques.  Working in a variety of scale, Denise creates panels that are graphic, contemporary and yet somehow nostalgic.  Often her pieces are black and white with minimalist colour accents, while others abound with colour - her visual vocabulary always unique and always authentic.
In her most recent series – Discoveries: Montreal - Denise explores each of the island city’s 34 boroughs.  Venturing out (camera in hand) she has captured the iconic and quirky details that make every borough unique, turning each into a one-of-a-kind mixed media panel.  The series offers a rare insight into the distinct flavors of all the ‘little villages’ that make up the island’s rich landscape.
Merging many photographs into a singular image, Denise’s unique impressions of the city capture the urban landscape through the eyes of a new resident, highlighting the often mundane, yet essential elements that make up the living, breathing and evolving ecosystem of the city she has called home since 2009.
 

About the book
Discoveries: Montreal is a 'series' and although all the pieces can be enjoyed on their own, they are more powerful as a whole. With original artwork being quite expensive, the individual pieces will probably be sold off separately after the initial showing. This art book will be a way to keep the series together and it will make it possible for people to enjoy the entire series at home for years to come.
This 96page book will be perfect bound with minimalist graphic design, featuring only one piece on each spread so each piece gets full attention. The book will also contain information about the artist and the project and some insights in the creation process. This book will look great on your bookshelf or on you coffee table and will make a great conversation starter.
I am currently working on the final pieces, the series is expected to be finished by the end of June 2013. The text for the book is in the editing phase and the graphic design has been started as well. The book will be in both French and in English, just like the city the project is based on. The publishing date for the book depends on the time needed for photography, translation, proof reading and printing, but it has tentatively been set for early September 2013. Keep an eye on the updates for information on the creation of the book and the final pieces of the series. 
 
Where will your money go?
This is a fixed campaign so you will only be charged if the campaign succeeds. The funds raised will be used to cover the costs of producing the book. It will pay for things like photographing the artwork, proofreading, editing, translation and printing of the book.
 

When can expect your perks?
Because this is a fixed campaign perk will not be shipped out until the end of the campaign. 
• The online credits will go live in the first week after the campaign has been finished. 
• The personalized art cards will be shipped in the first two weeks after the campaign has been finished.
• For the Giclee prints backers wil receive an email with on overview of all the boroughs in the first week after the campaign has been finished. Prints will be ordered as soon as all choices have been received, shipping will depend on the delivery time from the printer.
• The digital and physical copies of the book will be shipped as soon as they are finished. Copies for the supporters of this campaign wil be the first to be shipped. 
• Perks that include multiple items will be shipped as one package, delivery depends on contents.
You will be notified by email when your perk has been shipped.

<p>My name is Ashley Harris, and last year I represented the Chapel Hill team called the Sacrifical Poets at BNV, an international youth spoken word competition. I was chosen out of 12 youth to be on that six person team to voice the opinions of many in the Chapel Hill area. I wondered then why I was chosen. For 18 years of my life, I have been told to keep quiet. For 18 years of my life, I was told to cry, as long as no one heard me. I have been through many trials in my life, and through all of them had to keep them inside. When I finally wrote my feelings on paper and voiced them, I felt free. I felt like people were informed more about the issues I had but more importantly, I found that I was not alone. I found that I stirred concern in my stories, and that my stories brought me a sense of community. I believe the arts accomplish this feeling. I have been to numerous workshops, such as hip hop, rapping, dancing, and spoken word workshops that had programs to bring this sense of community. They kept children off the streets and they lessened violence in the areas they were held. It seemed in these workshops that despite ones denomination, sex, and race, they were able, through the focused art, to find common ground with one another. But unfortunately, Ive watched this institutions burn into the ground, become evicted and forgotten by the rest of the area. For example, there was a hip hop group from the Bronx that came to Charolette and told us about their after school program.</p>
<p>It sounded too good to be true, a haven where kids could do their work and invest in art that could possess a powerful, changing message. I believed in them whole heartedly, only to find out that they were convicted for a small fire hazard violation that was barely even visible. Then I came to realize this is happening everywhere, art programs are being shut down, and people could care less. Along with schools getting less funding, the first stab they see is the arts: they are quick to annilhate it. But they fail to realize the power of art, and how peaceful it can be. When a person goes on stage, when a child finger paints, when a singer sings, there is a common ground on that evoked emotion. There might be anger in that poet or artists voice, but in the audience there are hundreds of kids and adults who felt the same way and thought no one was listening. And those who didnt understand, finally do. That is the power of art no history, math, or science text book could ever achieve. When you read Issac Newton's laws, do you feel overwhelmed with emotion, that youve reached a revelation, that you no longer have to run away? That everything makes sense, and anger is futile, to forgive? Probably not. But with art, you do feel that. Art can cure an addict from addiction, art can help a runaway find his place, art can cure the sick.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This all sounds overly worded, but its true. Art saved me, a child from the lowest ends of the poverty line. A child who was bathed in verbal abuse. A child who was told at a young age they would be nothing. Art helped me realize I was not the only one, and there is a way we can help change the negative mentality this country gives the poor. There are people like me out there who feel worthless, like no one can or wants to hear them. But the exception is that I have my art, and I have this voice. There are many kids out there who have a voice that cannot be heard because there are no arts they can express themselves through. Me and three other women wish to restore this voice in areas where it has been degraded and devalued. I wish to go to Boston with these other talented artists and document the National Poetry Competition. As a member of The Rejects at UNC Chapel Hill, and a lifetime member of the Sacrificial poets, I believe it is crucial for me to bring art back. After it has touched my life, abandoning it would be the highest of treason. So please, help me and these young women as we try to reach out, and share the art of poets from all over the country.</p>

High Point was built on creativity in the form of the ingenuity that created the International Furniture Market.  We want to bring in world renowned artist TheLostCause (<a href=""http://www.thelostcausepdx.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thelostcausepdx.com</a>) in an effort to truly put our project on the map and raise the bar for public art in our area. The mission is not to take an opportunity away from local artists but to increase the opportunities for them to challenge themselves and provide a platform for them to take steps toward spreading their art to people around the world.</div><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p>Why High Point?</p><p>High Point was built and has thrived for many years on furniture and although manufacturing in the United States has left many cities barren and desolate, the furniture industry actually has a chance of returning to the states in a big way. This involves the growth and development of small batch manufacturers whom are currently hand making work locally. Designers of all sorts and creatives alike can find a world's audience in High Point as well as the contacts necessary to move their career forward. We want these people here and we need them here but reputations state that High Point lacks the community and culture to attract and retain this talent.  We need to show the world that we can support a strong creative class and an example can be set in High Point that we are truly on the verge of a second industrial revolution and this time we will be more conscientious about our practices as the stakes get higher.</p><p>High Point Mural Project: Making a difference one can at a time</p><p>Didn't realize one mural could have such a profound affect? A mural is a billboard to an artist or designer that they will be accepted and find peers that they can collaborate with,learn from and be challenged by.

If High Point had more murals, it would bring a buzz and level of excitement that is sustainable and profound.”-High Point Enterprise, <a href=""http://www.hpe.com/news/x2058990595/Coloring-outside-the-lines"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.hpe.com/news/x2058990595/Coloring-outside-the-lines</a></p><p>Come on High Point let's bring TheLostCause to High Point as a further push towards realizing our goals for making High Point the creative hub it is destined to be.</p><p>Just as murals are creative billboard it is also a representation of the artist's own creativity and message. As this mural will become a part of our community we want each of you to be part of it. Each of our prizes our designed to bring the community together, get to know the artist and celebrate the birth of the High Point Mural Project.</p><p></p><h3>Challenges: </h3><p>This journey to expand the cultural and creative capacity within our city has been an uphill battle. There have been years of challenges which have held us back in one way or another but we will continue to make cracks in the wall and as was started a year ago with the living wall eventually the flood of creativity will burst through and this revitalization will start to truly take hold.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other ways you can help:</h3><p>Keep fighting the good fight.

High Point was built on creativity in the form of the ingenuity that created the International Furniture Market.  We want to bring in world renowned artist TheLostCause (www.thelostcausepdx.com) in an effort to truly put our project on the map and raise the bar for public art in our area. The mission is not to take an opportunity away from local artists but to increase the opportunities for them to challenge themselves and provide a platform for them to take steps toward spreading their art to people around the world.The ImpactWhy High Point?High Point was built and has thrived for many years on furniture and although manufacturing in the United States has left many cities barren and desolate, the furniture industry actually has a chance of returning to the states in a big way. This involves the growth and development of small batch manufacturers whom are currently hand making work locally. Designers of all sorts and creatives alike can find a world's audience in High Point as well as the contacts necessary to move their career forward. We want these people here and we need them here but reputations state that High Point lacks the community and culture to attract and retain this talent.  We need to show the world that we can support a strong creative class and an example can be set in High Point that we are truly on the verge of a second industrial revolution and this time we will be more conscientious about our practices as the stakes get higher.High Point Mural Project: Making a difference one can at a timeDidn't realize one mural could have such a profound affect? A mural is a billboard to an artist or designer that they will be accepted and find peers that they can collaborate with,learn from and be challenged by. Please support bringing TheLostCause to High Point so we can continue our journey towards a more creative and interesting community.  What you need and what you get?Whale said when he comes to High Point in September, he wants to meet the locals and connect with artists while he paints murals that he hopes will have an impact.“Every city I have visited holds a high level of importance to their murals,” Whale said. “They are like landmarks and are talked about as such. If High Point had more murals, it would bring a buzz and level of excitement that is sustainable and profound.”-High Point Enterprise, http://www.hpe.com/news/x2058990595/Coloring-outside-the-linesCome on High Point let's bring TheLostCause to High Point as a further push towards realizing our goals for making High Point the creative hub it is destined to be.Just as murals are creative billboard it is also a representation of the artist's own creativity and message. As this mural will become a part of our community we want each of you to be part of it. Each of our prizes our designed to bring the community together, get to know the artist and celebrate the birth of the High Point Mural Project.Challenges: This journey to expand the cultural and creative capacity within our city has been an uphill battle. There have been years of challenges which have held us back in one way or another but we will continue to make cracks in the wall and as was started a year ago with the living wall eventually the flood of creativity will burst through and this revitalization will start to truly take hold.Other ways you can help:Keep fighting the good fight. Talk to people. Take action. Educate Yourself. Let Your Voice be heard and empower others to share theirs.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><strong>I have been training in the Japanese martial arts for 20 years…. 8 years ago I started making Japanese katana. I have met many peoples along the way, friends, brothers and of course teachers like Ben Kreiser, Sensei of </strong><strong>Min Ryû Shinto Ryu of the San Antonio School of Kenjutsu.  Ben Passed away in November 2012. He was an amazing man, teacher and martial artist. I can truly say knowing him for the short time I did know him; he made a major impact on my life. A few weeks before he passed, he called me and asked if I wanted his collection of Japanese fitting molds. Ben made his living doing restoration of Japanese katana.  Truly, he dedicated his life to preserving the Way of the Samurai. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> The collection is in a varied state. The newer molds are okay but with age they have deteriorated. The older molds are seriously deteriorated, Casters looking at them have called them ""gum"" meaning they are soft quite possibly unsalvageable. The older molds need to be repaired and remolded. I also want to preserve the more recent molds by creating new molds of each in a stronger longer lasting mold material as well as make a display of the collection. I plan to continue his work restoring Antique Katana as well as my work of creating new blades. The final goal of the project is to create a display of the final casting to setup in a public place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I would like to list a few themes I have noticed in the collection , particularly : cranes , dragons, water, bull, phoenix, eagle , Tiger , bamboo, chrysanthamums, water, fans,coy, monkeys, and several uniques geometric designs, Just to name a few I have noticed.</strong></p>

I will need to bring in a few experts. More Durable molds and models of all the individual pieces will be made. We will be using lost wax methods traditional to making these pieces.

It might take a week or more to repair the damaged pieces. All this will take several sculptures and casters to accomplish.

All of creation, from the distant past to the present moment, lives in the sword. All human existence flourishes right here in the sword you hold in your hands. You are now prepared for anything that may arise.” ― Morihei Ueshiba, The Art of Peace

 
We will be attempting to create a blog to show our progress, when you make your donation to the fundraiser , we will add your email to the blog update so you can see our progress.
The perks will be made after the fundraiser is over. We ask for your patience while we make them. The top perks will take the longest and with a lot of hustle, we are aiming to have all the perks save the top 3 completed and delivered in less than 3 months. That said we appreciate your patience. Several of the perks completion dates will be based on restoring the collection. We have set the number of perks HIGH so we can allow everyone to choose what they want and hopefully raise enough money to do more than just restore the collection.

<h2 class=""p1"">Why I make art...</h2>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">My entire life I have been affected and inspired through art. Growing up I was always drawing action figures, cars, and people from my favorite comic books. Little did I know, this would create a huge impact on my future. I received my first airbrush 10 years ago which shifted the direction of my art. It wasn’t until two years ago that I realized it was time for me to stretch out and grow. It was time to get an Art Studio. I started painting constantly and soon found it necessary to build my own panels. The use of wood became important as the foundation for my artwork. I started collaborating with an artist, my good friend, Travis Neditch. We painted back and forth on a single painting, fusing ideas and styles. Ever since that first collaborative piece was created, the momentum has continued to drive my art. I found that through collaboration: whether it is working side-by-side, with other artists, or simply sharing ideas of projects yet to come, creativity is limitless. Painting is one of my greatest passions, not only is it rewarding work it also makes me happy!</span></p>

<p>My name is Kameron Ross and I am a student at the Maryland Institute College of Art. I aspire to be a makeup/special effects artist for film or TV when I graduate. I have been applying and designing makeup for over 5 years, mostly unpaid work for family, friends, and campus activities.  </p>
<p>Recently, I entered two of my pieces in a competition sponsored by international makeup brand Illamasqua. Out of hundreds of applicants in my category (nonprofessional makeup artist), me and three other applicants were selected to participate in a live competition at the British Academy of Film and TV Arts in London on Oct 5, 2013 at 11:30am! I will be applying a makeup design of my creation during 90 minutes in front of makeup industry big-leagues. One of the judges is my all time my idol, makeup artist Alex Box! Applying a makeup in front of her is the equivalent of singing for Whitney Houston. This means so much to me in many ways, and I consider this the highest honor I've ever received for my talents. </p>
<div>Unfortunately, the competition does not sponsor travel/accommodation for its conestants. I will have to front the cost of round airfare, hotel for two nights, and meals for three days. Below is a breakdown of costs. </div>
<div>Airfare, roundtrip DC to London: 1002.40$</div>
<div>Hotel, Holiday Inn Heathrow, London: 90$/night, 270$ total</div>
<div>Meals for three days: 12$/meal, 108$ total</div>
<div>Through my part-time job, I am able to cover the costs of meals and hotel, but cannot afford the airfare. I am looking for assistance with the cost of airfare, which will be 1000$ roundtrip from DC to London. If any financial assistance can be offered to me, I would be more than grateful.<p></p>

<br/></span></span></div>","My name is Kameron Ross and I am a student at the Maryland Institute College of Art. I aspire to be a makeup/special effects artist for film or TV when I graduate. I have been applying and designing makeup for over 5 years, mostly unpaid work for family, friends, and campus activities.  
Recently, I entered two of my pieces in a competition sponsored by international makeup brand Illamasqua. Out of hundreds of applicants in my category (nonprofessional makeup artist), me and three other applicants were selected to participate in a live competition at the British Academy of Film and TV Arts in London on Oct 5, 2013 at 11:30am! I will be applying a makeup design of my creation during 90 minutes in front of makeup industry big-leagues. One of the judges is my all time my idol, makeup artist Alex Box! Applying a makeup in front of her is the equivalent of singing for Whitney Houston. This means so much to me in many ways, and I consider this the highest honor I've ever received for my talents. 
Unfortunately, the competition does not sponsor travel/accommodation for its conestants. I will have to front the cost of round airfare, hotel for two nights, and meals for three days. Below is a breakdown of costs. 
Airfare, roundtrip DC to London: 1002.40$
Hotel, Holiday Inn Heathrow, London: 90$/night, 270$ total
Meals for three days: 12$/meal, 108$ total
Through my part-time job, I am able to cover the costs of meals and hotel, but cannot afford the airfare. I am looking for assistance with the cost of airfare, which will be 1000$ roundtrip from DC to London. If any financial assistance can be offered to me, I would be more than grateful.

<p>H.H. Sri Sri Ravi Shankar's goal is to create social change through non-violence. He asks people to commit an act of non-violence for every violent act they witness. He also shared ways people can reduce stress in their lives, because, according to Sri Sri, stress is one of the leading forces behind violence. </p>
<p>NONVIO aims to take action by making violence associated with shame in our society. Where aggression and violence are promoted human values are destroyed but we need to promote human values now more than ever.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The NONVIO event promotes the intolerance of non-violence in all facets of our
communities. Our education system needs to inherently exhibit teachings revolving around tolerance, awareness and peace rather than greed and
self-promotion. Critically today youth and adults alike need to be educated
about the violence towards our natural environment and the degradation of
mother earth – with the awareness built through marketing endeavours with the help of your contribution, we can make the voice of Non-violence louder than violence itself. </p>

Also, Henri will be letting people know how they can best help those in need as he shows his own photos taken of the devastation in December of 2013 and January of 2014, along with the co-created artwork, which together will build a sense of urgency that much help is necessary.  <br/><br/><b>B) </b>  Offering the pieces of mixed-media art which Henri made together with the victims, of which will greatly help those families who assisted and collaborated with Henri on the art.

This came on top of the destruction caused by the earthquake less than a month before. Tacloban is ruined beyond recognition. And the reconstruction effort is being delayed due to the turmoil.  People are severely struggling with getting just the necessities.  Relief efforts are far behind what the original goals were. <br/><br/>Henri Cainglet is an award winning Filipino artist on a mission to bring direct assistance to those who need it most. Henri is in the devastated communities often, and has spent a great deal of time doing what few others are able to do - listening to, talking with, and getting the victims involved.  All of the photos shown in this campaign were taken by Henri in his travels doing the work he does for as many survivors as he can. Henri lives and works with the most affected victims of these tragedies. Wherever he goes, Henri educates the public with insight into which necessities are the most urgent, the best agencies to allocate contributions to, and by continuously raising awareness that the areas affected cannot be forgotten - too much still needs to be done. From their shattered lives, he teaches the survivors the skills necessary to create - to create art made from the very pieces of strewn debris scattered across what is left of the communities where his neighbors once called home.<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/498931/files/20140410115432-cover-photo.jpg?1397156072"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h1>About Henri Cainglet</h1><h1><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; color: rgb(34, 34, 34);""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FIFV2iavz2pc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DIFV2iavz2pc&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FIFV2iavz2pc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/></span></h1><p>Henri Cainglet is best known for his ""found-objects"" art composed of paintings, sculptures, and soft pieces. Mr. Cainglet has created Art in Tacloban after Typhoon Haiyan, and in his home town of Valencia, which is one of the towns in Bohol in the aftermath of the earthquake, using  the objects found along the paths of destruction by these two tragedies. His works have been seen in museums from Singapore and Malaysia, to Berlin, Austria, New York and San Francisco. His unique flair is to incorporate an objects’ unrefined roughness, its original state, into award-winning compositions. Cainglet received the 1996 Grand Prize in the National Visual Arts Competition in Manila, 1st prize in Sculpture, and 2nd Prize in the 1999 Hong Kong City of Life Jeepney Design Contest, among others. He is associated with the Kulay-Diwa Gallery of Philippine Contemporary Art in Manila., whose goal is to discover and promote the works of talented, young Filipino Artists.  Henri was honored to speak before the United Nations on February 18th, 2014 in their “Urban Futures . . . South Meets North” event for the “Age of Connectivity: Cities, Magnets of Hope . . . Imagining the Possible” Series which supported the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), HABITAT III Preparatory Process along with the International Council for Caring Communities, Inc.

Also, Henri will be letting people know how they can best help those in need as he shows his own photos taken of the devastation in December of 2013 and January of 2014, along with the co-created artwork, which together will build a sense of urgency that much help is necessary.  B)   Offering the pieces of mixed-media art which Henri made together with the victims, of which will greatly help those families who assisted and collaborated with Henri on the art. Together, the cost of the exhibitions expenses, along with the remainder going to the survivors.Super Typhoon Haiyan left more than 6,300 dead and over 1,000 missing - one of the most powerful storms to ever have hit the islands. This came on top of the destruction caused by the earthquake less than a month before. Tacloban is ruined beyond recognition. And the reconstruction effort is being delayed due to the turmoil.  People are severely struggling with getting just the necessities.  Relief efforts are far behind what the original goals were. Henri Cainglet is an award winning Filipino artist on a mission to bring direct assistance to those who need it most. Henri is in the devastated communities often, and has spent a great deal of time doing what few others are able to do - listening to, talking with, and getting the victims involved.  All of the photos shown in this campaign were taken by Henri in his travels doing the work he does for as many survivors as he can. Henri lives and works with the most affected victims of these tragedies. Wherever he goes, Henri educates the public with insight into which necessities are the most urgent, the best agencies to allocate contributions to, and by continuously raising awareness that the areas affected cannot be forgotten - too much still needs to be done. From their shattered lives, he teaches the survivors the skills necessary to create - to create art made from the very pieces of strewn debris scattered across what is left of the communities where his neighbors once called home.About Henri CaingletHenri Cainglet is best known for his ""found-objects"" art composed of paintings, sculptures, and soft pieces. Mr. Cainglet has created Art in Tacloban after Typhoon Haiyan, and in his home town of Valencia, which is one of the towns in Bohol in the aftermath of the earthquake, using  the objects found along the paths of destruction by these two tragedies. His works have been seen in museums from Singapore and Malaysia, to Berlin, Austria, New York and San Francisco. His unique flair is to incorporate an objects’ unrefined roughness, its original state, into award-winning compositions. Cainglet received the 1996 Grand Prize in the National Visual Arts Competition in Manila, 1st prize in Sculpture, and 2nd Prize in the 1999 Hong Kong City of Life Jeepney Design Contest, among others. He is associated with the Kulay-Diwa Gallery of Philippine Contemporary Art in Manila., whose goal is to discover and promote the works of talented, young Filipino Artists.  Henri was honored to speak before the United Nations on February 18th, 2014 in their “Urban Futures . . . South Meets North” event for the “Age of Connectivity: Cities, Magnets of Hope . . . Imagining the Possible” Series which supported the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), HABITAT III Preparatory Process along with the International Council for Caring Communities, Inc. (ICCC).  Your help in his project will go directly to the victims who need it the most.just last month...*below are photos taken by HenriThe Outskirts of Tacloban after the typhoon.and more.It's hard to know what's going to happen next.Amazingly, some things survived, and even among total loss, life begins anew. Certain remnants seemingly give blessings and hope of a new life to come.What's left to use? Henri and these boys collected shattered pieces and slippers ""left behind"" to create hopeful art pieces as a tribute.So many families lost everything, and were torn apart.Working with the Community    *See more families Henri has helped with his art in the Gallery Artwork Henri has created with those who were in despair before Henri introduced them to artistic expression.These survivors have found renewed hope, thanks to Henri's motivating them to create art which he hopes will raise funds for these very same. These works were in progress at the time the photographs were taken. Now finished (seen in the Gallery). Creating Art has allowed these victims of the tragedies find hope, and to deal with their despair by creating something of value in the wake of tragedy.CostsContributions will cover  the expenses involved in art exhibits and travel expenses. A portion of the money from the sale of the Art is going to the people needing it the most - some of whose faces you can see above and on the following page. A portion of the proceeds we raise from the backers supporting our cause will go to the accredited organizations. Of all charities Henri knows from his neighbors hurting the most, it is the Switzerland International Red Cross who are doing the most with the money donors are contributing.  Henri hopes to have an exhibition at the Philippines Embassy in Washington, D.C.  Along with some of the pieces made along with the victims of the tragedies,  the following art work done by the award-winning artist.

Franchino has shown his artwork at Artscape once before, in 2010 showing his Auduino Ant Farm, a synthesizer that translated ant movement into noise, as part of Betascape.  His first large interactive installation was Locale Unlimited, a collaboration with Jeremy Stern, in which Adam controlled lights shooting through starscapes hand cut in large paper by Jeremy.  

SuperGame!
Would not be possible without the network of Baltimore artists who are volunteering their skills and time to help make this
large scale project possible.  We are fortunate to have such an enthusiastic community of creative people contributing to aspects of SuperGame! such as construction, painting and sewing of game components, sign making, light animations, sound production, game operation during the festival, and of course, an endless supply of moral support. Scott and Adam hard at work on the structure for World Destruction Ring Toss!

<b style=""background-color: initial;"">INTRODUCTION</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<br/>Dear friends, <br/>
<br/>
It's been twelve years now I work in Rio de Janeiro with poetry, tourism, music,
arts in general and social inclusion. I participated in an NGO which
supports needy children from favela Parada de Lucas (Rio's periphery) with
projects such as graffiti, stencil, music and local collectivity.<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">At this time i've followed the
needs and issues of these children’s and others who could not participate in this program due to lack of physical space.<br/>Everyday in these NGO made me see how we have brilliant kids in the slums with no opportunity for their development.</span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""> I've been in this project for some months b</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">ut my heart and my mind are still touched by the memories of moments i had in this place.<br/>I can remember the heartness of these children and how my little contribution was important to them.</span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">M</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">eanwhile,  this time I've been giving guitar lessons, studying, working as a freelancer
in tourism, sometimes catching up some works as a photographer, feeding a website and a blog, making drawings and producing shirts, writing daily poems,
publishing books, tryin to raise funds for a educational project i have (I'll talk a
bit more about this later) and have some time to educate my daughter. So my time to do volunteer work was pratically zero and i needed think how give sequence in my contributions with society. Then i made a educational project to allow me do something with longer range.</span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The contribution i ask is to hire people to work with me in my initiatives. </span></div><div>So far my videos,
my volunteer works, my classes, my studies, my website, my books and editions were all funded by me, since part of creation, structural publishing and
marketing. I'm really passionate about what I do. But t<span style=""background-color: initial;"">he things are not
going the way I expected, and my art and social contribution are somewhat tied
by lack of funds. I was very reluctant until now but I have to agree that it is
time to ask for some help, I'm exhausted. </span>
</div><div>
At the moment, my educational project is validated by the Brazilian Ministry of
Culture and is valued at around $152.437,00, but here I only ask an initial
amount which I believe already cover some needs.<br/>
<br/>
I have been finding it difficult to raise the necessary to consolidate it as
most private organizations in Brazil only aim to profit financially from their
own investments or help projects that have truly walk alone and not need
monetary coverage. I find it strange, but is the way it works.<br/>
<br/>
About the contents, our project deals with poetry, music and we have future
plans to cover other subjects such as the ones mentioned above but aiming at
global inclusion, given that we intend to draw the attention of other countries
and cultures to our real everyday lives and even translate all texts to another
languages.<br/>
<br/>
We aim to meet the demands of all classes of the Brazilian society and intend
to use any funds received in the best possible way, highlighting the popular
culture, and opening up new climbs to strengthen and encourage the arts,
reading and music, reducing inequalities of opportunity in our country.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone involved and wish all participants in this project,
supporters or contributors, a better world, more just and free of all chains
that limit progress.<br/>
Best regards!<br/><br/><br/><ul><li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">ABOUT ME AND MY ART</b><br/>
</li></ul>
<span><br/> Well, for you to understand better about the aspects of my art, I have 31 years
old, one eleven year old daughter named Ana Julia, which is the name of a song
from a Rio band of MPB and Rock, well known here in my state.<br/>
I am known here as Magheize, a nickname given by my childhood friends.<br/>
<br/>
I was born in Suburb, more precisely between the North Zone and the Baixada
Fluminense. Since childhood I lived with the reality of working, fight for
my ideals, take care of my family and bring a smile even in the face of
adversity.<br/>
Here in Brazil is no lack of warmth and difficulties to be overcome.<br/>
<br/>
I studied for four years at FAETEC which is a technical and academic center
near my old neighborhood. There I majored in Speech, Music and presented my final
thesis on diaphragmatic breathing and employment exercises for the muscles in
the singing voice.</span>
</div><div>
<span>After the course I also did a test and graduated as a popular musician in guitar, singing and percussion by the Order of the Musicians of Brazil.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, i work on a cultural project, validated by Cultural Ministry and search about tourism, in Celso Suckow da Fonseca federal center, in addition to working in the area with people around the world, I do gradually some investiments in my social and music projects, aiming to become an exponent here in my country.</span>
</div><div><span>During these lines you will be able to better understand my story, what I've done here, where I am and where I'm going.<br/></span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div>
<ul><li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">SOME OF MY MUSIC. <br/></b>
</li></ul>
<div>These are some videos I made after a short course of editing and audio programming.<br/>
</div>
<span>
<br/><b>
AMENDOEIRA (Almond)</b><br/><br/>The almond is a very popular tree in suburban streets, gives us no
edible fruit but is a very wide and full of leaves. Every day you find
people taking shade to escape the high temperatures that reach 41 degrees
centigrade.</span>
</div><div>
<span>I grew up playing under these trees, which coincidentally existed
both in front of the house where I was raised, as in the pavement of the house of
my maternal grandparents where I spent my school holidays. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">At night it was surrounded by bats, well, I remember my kites hold them and
hide myself from other children in plays of hide and seek.</span>
</div><div><span>
This song alludes precisely in a metaphor about the difficulty of growing
up on the strees and face the time, is about the creativity of my people, your beauty and
the power that comes from this.</span></div><div><span>
I made this music with some things I learned on folk guitar, classical and
bossa nova. </span></div><div>

<p>Even so I was very pleased to be able to actively participate and take a bit of my culture to other places, this music give me some work and made me more powerfull with the strings.</p></span></div><div><span>

<div><span><p><b>SUPERNOVA</b><br/><br/>Nothing is more curious than the universe and that I've always been very curious about this subject. I made this song for a custom
soundtrack and thinking about music theraphy. Some parts were recovered
and ended up doing a synchronized video clippings with some images that was ready in my home studio.<br/>
<br/>I conclude that it is a very good music to sleep, and whenever working on my
stuff by dawn, I hear this music before falling asleep.</p>

<br/>
<b>TRISTES DIAS (SAD DAYS)</b><br/><br/>
This song was composed at the time of my adolescence, I just came to do the
recording and music video about ten years later.<br/>
<br/>
At this time I was writing five to ten poems a day and was not going to guitar
lessons. It was a very difficult phase in my life because my parents were
separating and had many fights, my daughter was very small and I had taken a
job as a mattress salesman and felt that walked in the opposite of art.<br/>
<br/>
But life, in spite of preaching in these parts, makes us stronger and makes us
face some facts, even bitter.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways it was exactly at this time that I decided to work with art and to
follow up my career this way.<br/>
<br/>
Developed a keener critical sense and I could see that we must give up some
things that are not relevant, because the only way to go, best of all, are the
pathways that make our hearts throb.<br/>
<br/>
The video images come to complete a comprehensive way what I felt at that time,
and this time, some musicians participated with flutes, percussion and electric
guitars.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to embed the video clip in a contest of Brazilian MTV, but what did the
head of staff at the time was the National Rap, MPB was already in decline due
to the fever of the troubled political moment that we passed.<br/>
<br/>
This was one of my best productions.<p></p>
<p>

<b>BEHIND BLUE EYES</b><br/><br/>I made this video for an ex-girlfriend of mine who had beautiful blue eyes.
We have separated after two years together and I was feeling crazy because in addition to not be giving more classes or working on art, I was very anxious to join college in Petropolis, highland area of Rio.<br/>
<br/>
I wondered a lot about being or not being a good artist and thought I really
had no talent for anything, since i had failed, somehow, every
contest i had entered.<br/>
<br/>
At this time I learned a lot about doing good clips with low costs and any tools. Prepared a portfolio of songs and invented a ""B"" plan to record a commercial CD in order to market it.<p></p>
<p>
<br/>
Finally, I got enough average and entered in the field of tourism and
hospitality. As soon as I arrived in that town, walked on foot for two days searching for any work, and finally got a job as a bilingual messenger at a local hotel. So i rooted in the place.<br/>
<br/>
My willpower and need for a change of scenery was so much that i took only a week to settle me.<br/>
<br/>
The longing of my ex-girlfriend was dissipating and my luck began to change.<br/>On this date I listened rock all time and needed to convert my feelings into
art, even though I was not use this video for any purpose.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F4pfUHs2zbL0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D4pfUHs2zbL0&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F4pfUHs2zbL0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>
<br/><b>THE LION'S MARCH</b><br/><br/>Very well, if you've followed me this far, you realize that I love study, learn new things and develop ideas. Even in bad conditions. Can also be inside of fact that I don't hold me a styles, i like music, and instrumental is one type i like much cause i got freedom feelings on it.<br/>
<br/>
This video was a test I did to see if I could accompany images with a guitar, improvising
music and connect them to the movements of animals on a documentary.<br/>
<br/>
Chose the lions because they are angry, they are at the top of the food chain
in grasslands, and also because it was the animal I most identified myself
at that moment. I had a complete mastery on choices. One day, reading Soren Kieerkegaard in a librally, a phrase struck me
too ""the truth is always a truth in action, as the faith is always faith
through works.""<br/>
<br/>
This Danish philosopher made some comparations between animal society and human. then I could see by his eyes and understand what he was saying.<br/>
<br/>
All this went through my head and then I I filtered the ideas for this arrangement with almost ten minutes long.<p></p>

<p><b>O BATE-BOLA
(The Beat-Ball)</b></p>
<p><br/>
<b>The tittle</b></p>
<p>
Bate-bola is a fantasy carnival popularly used in our festival. The
tradition was brought by Portuguese colonists, and was also influenced by the
Folia de Reis (Reverly King).</p>
<p>
In the early days, the fantasy of Bate-ball is much resembled the clown, but
including terrifying masks. Hitting the ground with their ox bladders quite
smelly, arrested by rope to a pole or cable, the hits balls were the terror of
the children. The balls are no longer bladders and now are rubber or plastic
but the fearful attitude of hits balls remains.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
<b>The Contents</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b></b></p>
<p>The book
alludes to the difficulties and delights of academic art world, paths and
difficulties, from the teachers to the entrance in the television medium and
state.</p>
<p>The title was
chosen as a metaphor to exemplify the attitude to achieve recognition and
success.</p>
<p>The book was also accepted by Cultura bookstore, one of the most popular of our country<br/></p>

<br/>
<br/>
The tittle</b></p>
<p><span>
The title makes reference to the discomfort that each sector of art
and Brazilian culture, may or may not cause every spectator.<br/><br/></span></p>
<p><span><b>
The Contents</b></span></p>
<p><span>This book was written as a comedy critical to
elucidate the growing Brazilian programs dedicated to laughter.</span></p>
<b>
</b><p>There is also
corroboration regarding some aspects of sex tourism, the period of
popularization of art via social medias and the question of tastes and
identification for every style of music.<br/></p>
<p>This time, the editing was done by a São Paulo company that would give me a better margin in publications and greater freedom of choice in the layout.</p>
<p>The cover was made by me, the detail is in the author's name, which is pushed out of the case, implying that there was an error in editing, but is not. This was indeed the expected effect to give the idea of the lack of space for the author in the book market.</p>
<p>In fact, the book's narrative that's about it, take things seriously while everyone is joking around. Trust in own work and potential.</p>

<p>I have developed a cultural project called ""Poesia na Música"" (Poetry in Music), which was recently approved by the Brazilian Ministry of Culture,  in accordance with the Rouanet Law, article 26,  allowing us - according to the standards of ""Rouanet"" Law, article 26 - the sponsorship opportunity through Donations, Tax Waiver or Federal Tax Incentives to fundraising revolving around R$ 340,580.00,  around US$ 150,000.00. </p>
<p>As still could not get a sponsor, I decided do this crowdfunding to reduce the amount required to 1/3, which is precisely what is necessary to start.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><br/></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Cultural details of the project</b></p>
<p>In the next semester, we will launch our website "" POESIA NA MÚSICA"", presenting to the world the icons of Brazilian popular musical poetry and the history of our music. They will be listed by the decade in which they acted, from the 1920' icon and pioneer, Heitor Villa Lobos.</p>
<p> Villa-Lobos engaged in what is the most significative popular music genre, featured in the most important group of Brazilian poet-musicians.  </p>
<p>Our project will be made available in both Portuguese and English, welcoming users from different parts of the world. We will also elaborate subtitled videos enabling the inclusion of the hearing and visually impaired.</p>
<p>There will be space for debates, sharing material about the subjects in the scope of the website and also poetry contests. A dynamic and practical way to spread knowledge and the perpetuation of our culture. </p>
<p>The project aims at strengthening cultural, to be able in the near future, meet the social sphere.<br/></p>

INTRODUCTION

Dear friends, 

It's been twelve years now I work in Rio de Janeiro with poetry, tourism, music,
arts in general and social inclusion. I participated in an NGO which
supports needy children from favela Parada de Lucas (Rio's periphery) with
projects such as graffiti, stencil, music and local collectivity.At this time i've followed the
needs and issues of these children’s and others who could not participate in this program due to lack of physical space.Everyday in these NGO made me see how we have brilliant kids in the slums with no opportunity for their development.

 I've been in this project for some months but my heart and my mind are still touched by the memories of moments i had in this place.I can remember the heartness of these children and how my little contribution was important to them.

Meanwhile,  this time I've been giving guitar lessons, studying, working as a freelancer
in tourism, sometimes catching up some works as a photographer, feeding a website and a blog, making drawings and producing shirts, writing daily poems,
publishing books, tryin to raise funds for a educational project i have (I'll talk a
bit more about this later) and have some time to educate my daughter. So my time to do volunteer work was pratically zero and i needed think how give sequence in my contributions with society. Then i made a educational project to allow me do something with longer range.
The contribution i ask is to hire people to work with me in my initiatives. So far my videos,
my volunteer works, my classes, my studies, my website, my books and editions were all funded by me, since part of creation, structural publishing and
marketing. I'm really passionate about what I do. But the things are not
going the way I expected, and my art and social contribution are somewhat tied
by lack of funds. I was very reluctant until now but I have to agree that it is
time to ask for some help, I'm exhausted. 

At the moment, my educational project is validated by the Brazilian Ministry of
Culture and is valued at around $152.437,00, but here I only ask an initial
amount which I believe already cover some needs.

I have been finding it difficult to raise the necessary to consolidate it as
most private organizations in Brazil only aim to profit financially from their
own investments or help projects that have truly walk alone and not need
monetary coverage. I find it strange, but is the way it works.

About the contents, our project deals with poetry, music and we have future
plans to cover other subjects such as the ones mentioned above but aiming at
global inclusion, given that we intend to draw the attention of other countries
and cultures to our real everyday lives and even translate all texts to another
languages.

We aim to meet the demands of all classes of the Brazilian society and intend
to use any funds received in the best possible way, highlighting the popular
culture, and opening up new climbs to strengthen and encourage the arts,
reading and music, reducing inequalities of opportunity in our country.

Thanks to everyone involved and wish all participants in this project,
supporters or contributors, a better world, more just and free of all chains
that limit progress.
Best regards!
ABOUT ME AND MY ART

 Well, for you to understand better about the aspects of my art, I have 31 years
old, one eleven year old daughter named Ana Julia, which is the name of a song
from a Rio band of MPB and Rock, well known here in my state.
I am known here as Magheize, a nickname given by my childhood friends.

I was born in Suburb, more precisely between the North Zone and the Baixada
Fluminense. Since childhood I lived with the reality of working, fight for
my ideals, take care of my family and bring a smile even in the face of
adversity.
Here in Brazil is no lack of warmth and difficulties to be overcome.

I studied for four years at FAETEC which is a technical and academic center
near my old neighborhood. There I majored in Speech, Music and presented my final
thesis on diaphragmatic breathing and employment exercises for the muscles in
the singing voice.

After the course I also did a test and graduated as a popular musician in guitar, singing and percussion by the Order of the Musicians of Brazil.

At the moment, i work on a cultural project, validated by Cultural Ministry and search about tourism, in Celso Suckow da Fonseca federal center, in addition to working in the area with people around the world, I do gradually some investiments in my social and music projects, aiming to become an exponent here in my country.
During these lines you will be able to better understand my story, what I've done here, where I am and where I'm going.

SOME OF MY MUSIC. 

These are some videos I made after a short course of editing and audio programming.



AMENDOEIRA (Almond)The almond is a very popular tree in suburban streets, gives us no
edible fruit but is a very wide and full of leaves. Every day you find
people taking shade to escape the high temperatures that reach 41 degrees
centigrade.

I grew up playing under these trees, which coincidentally existed
both in front of the house where I was raised, as in the pavement of the house of
my maternal grandparents where I spent my school holidays. At night it was surrounded by bats, well, I remember my kites hold them and
hide myself from other children in plays of hide and seek.

This song alludes precisely in a metaphor about the difficulty of growing
up on the strees and face the time, is about the creativity of my people, your beauty and
the power that comes from this.
I made this music with some things I learned on folk guitar, classical and
bossa nova. 

GNOSISI made this videoclip to entering contests of musical short films, remember to have it sent to some festivals in Cannes, Seoul, Berlin and other countries but i think my material doesn't been good enough to enter any of then.
Even so I was very pleased to be able to actively participate and take a bit of my culture to other places, this music give me some work and made me more powerfull with the strings.
The video is about the stages of life, is about having the knowledge that everything is finite.

SUPERNOVANothing is more curious than the universe and that I've always been very curious about this subject. I made this song for a custom
soundtrack and thinking about music theraphy. Some parts were recovered
and ended up doing a synchronized video clippings with some images that was ready in my home studio.
I conclude that it is a very good music to sleep, and whenever working on my
stuff by dawn, I hear this music before falling asleep.


TRISTES DIAS (SAD DAYS)
This song was composed at the time of my adolescence, I just came to do the
recording and music video about ten years later.

At this time I was writing five to ten poems a day and was not going to guitar
lessons. It was a very difficult phase in my life because my parents were
separating and had many fights, my daughter was very small and I had taken a
job as a mattress salesman and felt that walked in the opposite of art.

But life, in spite of preaching in these parts, makes us stronger and makes us
face some facts, even bitter.

In some ways it was exactly at this time that I decided to work with art and to
follow up my career this way.

Developed a keener critical sense and I could see that we must give up some
things that are not relevant, because the only way to go, best of all, are the
pathways that make our hearts throb.

The video images come to complete a comprehensive way what I felt at that time,
and this time, some musicians participated with flutes, percussion and electric
guitars.

I tried to embed the video clip in a contest of Brazilian MTV, but what did the
head of staff at the time was the National Rap, MPB was already in decline due
to the fever of the troubled political moment that we passed.

This was one of my best productions.


BEHIND BLUE EYESI made this video for an ex-girlfriend of mine who had beautiful blue eyes.
We have separated after two years together and I was feeling crazy because in addition to not be giving more classes or working on art, I was very anxious to join college in Petropolis, highland area of Rio.

I wondered a lot about being or not being a good artist and thought I really
had no talent for anything, since i had failed, somehow, every
contest i had entered.

At this time I learned a lot about doing good clips with low costs and any tools. Prepared a portfolio of songs and invented a ""B"" plan to record a commercial CD in order to market it.


Finally, I got enough average and entered in the field of tourism and
hospitality. As soon as I arrived in that town, walked on foot for two days searching for any work, and finally got a job as a bilingual messenger at a local hotel. So i rooted in the place.

My willpower and need for a change of scenery was so much that i took only a week to settle me.

The longing of my ex-girlfriend was dissipating and my luck began to change.On this date I listened rock all time and needed to convert my feelings into
art, even though I was not use this video for any purpose.

THE LION'S MARCHVery well, if you've followed me this far, you realize that I love study, learn new things and develop ideas. Even in bad conditions. Can also be inside of fact that I don't hold me a styles, i like music, and instrumental is one type i like much cause i got freedom feelings on it.

This video was a test I did to see if I could accompany images with a guitar, improvising
music and connect them to the movements of animals on a documentary.

Chose the lions because they are angry, they are at the top of the food chain
in grasslands, and also because it was the animal I most identified myself
at that moment. I had a complete mastery on choices. One day, reading Soren Kieerkegaard in a librally, a phrase struck me
too ""the truth is always a truth in action, as the faith is always faith
through works.""

This Danish philosopher made some comparations between animal society and human. then I could see by his eyes and understand what he was saying.

All this went through my head and then I I filtered the ideas for this arrangement with almost ten minutes long.



SMALL SHOWS AND GIGS
I will be brief to comment on this video.

There by the middle of 2009, I was the singer of this band called Foramalú. I sang covers of rock bands in Lapa, downtown Rio where the bands do a circuit. We were one of the bands that were always called.


We made a hundred concerts and gigs by the four corners of the state and this
was one of them. The video was made by a fan.


INK WORKS
Some street paintings, made parallel classes for children.





This is my daughter, Ana Julia. This time she must have been about six years old.


This refrigerator was painted to customer specification for a craft store. I worked on it for three hours and liked the result. The client even more.
After this day, I felt that artistic painting had not even limits.

Working on...



CLASSESThese photos were taken on a day of volunteer work in the slums of
Parada de Lucas, I was six months on the project, then called me to get fixed,
but was busy with a range of concerts and compositions copyright songs for
joining festivals state. I miss these kids that were really special.
 I do not
know if their have reached individual goals, but I know they were very good in what
they did. It was very nice to feel the affection of them with me
The educational project I have, currently occurred to me this time, but only got
approval from the ministry of culture in mid-2013.PARADA DE LUCAS SLUMS


These photos were taken by fifth graders in high school Anchieta, where I also participated with some art classes. I was the youngest of the teachers on the institution and had low experience but did my part with them.
ANCHIETA'S COLLEGE

BATUCADA'S BLOCK



PHOTOGRAPHY AND TOURISM
These are some photos I took as part of Tours.


Once I entered college, had a stoppage of almost a school year. The strike of 2011 devastated the students and so I returned to Rio with a locked
registration and entered the job market with only one completed period. Worked in for four years without leaving my project aside.

RED BEACH, URCA
The Red Beach is located in the neighborhood of Urca, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The beach is greatly appreciated by the surrounding landscape between the Urca and the hill of Babilônia.
The beach, despite having no large waves is deep.
In its sands, can be seen garnet crystals, but this is not the reason of his name; it is so called because the sand becomes reddish when the sun goes down, due to the reflection of sunlight on the red crystals and roses.
This photo was taken for a client who was visiting the Sugar Loaf.

Botafogo Praia is located in Botafogo Bay, the eponymous district in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

O BATE-BOLA
(The Beat-Ball)

The tittle

Bate-bola is a fantasy carnival popularly used in our festival. The
tradition was brought by Portuguese colonists, and was also influenced by the
Folia de Reis (Reverly King).

In the early days, the fantasy of Bate-ball is much resembled the clown, but
including terrifying masks. Hitting the ground with their ox bladders quite
smelly, arrested by rope to a pole or cable, the hits balls were the terror of
the children. The balls are no longer bladders and now are rubber or plastic
but the fearful attitude of hits balls remains.


The Contents

The book
alludes to the difficulties and delights of academic art world, paths and
difficulties, from the teachers to the entrance in the television medium and
state.
The title was
chosen as a metaphor to exemplify the attitude to achieve recognition and
success.
The book was also accepted by Cultura bookstore, one of the most popular of our country

POEMAS
ESCROTOS EXCRETADOS COMO CRÔNICAS
(Scrotums poems excreted as chronic)


The tittle

The title makes reference to the discomfort that each sector of art
and Brazilian culture, may or may not cause every spectator.

The Contents
This book was written as a comedy critical to
elucidate the growing Brazilian programs dedicated to laughter.

There is also
corroboration regarding some aspects of sex tourism, the period of
popularization of art via social medias and the question of tastes and
identification for every style of music.
This time, the editing was done by a São Paulo company that would give me a better margin in publications and greater freedom of choice in the layout.
The cover was made by me, the detail is in the author's name, which is pushed out of the case, implying that there was an error in editing, but is not. This was indeed the expected effect to give the idea of the lack of space for the author in the book market.
In fact, the book's narrative that's about it, take things seriously while everyone is joking around. Trust in own work and potential.

MUSICAL CIRCUIT


Some photos taken five years of work as a singer, producer and band concerts.MOFO BAR, LAPA

On the first floor of the old house is the bar with 130 seats.
I remember arriving at the last minute this day, for the soundcheck and also we replaced our drummer, who was having personal problems and can not attend.
Was a day of great hardship, however overcome. The show was very good and people loved our copyright songs.




SALOON 79, BOTAFOGO


The saloon 79, is a rock bar very popular in Botafogo. The only rule of the place is, playing rock and play loud. The place team was very competent and treated us very well.
Three bands performed on this day and the house was very crowded in the middle of our presentation.
When I arrived, there were not many people and i worried, but this time we had no problems and all members attended, everything happened as expected.



SESC, ENGENHO DE DENTRO

Festival of independent bands supported by the state board.
Tonight we did a forty-five minute set, with copyright songs I wrote in a week.
I remember that the band worked hard on the songs and our bass player can not participate because it was in Minas Gerais, waiting for the birth of your child.
Two new members were called, and a friend of ours, flutist, made appearances on some songs.
Ended the night in Lapa, to do a brief celebration. It was a very special day for us.


ODYSSEY THEATRE
We were headlining the night, remember it was a weekend, the house was packed.
It was my last show with this band before falling by late nights writing my educational project and working day in the bureaucratic part of it.

ABOUT MY EDUCATIONAL PROJECT WITH CULTURAL MINISTRY

I have developed a cultural project called ""Poesia na Música"" (Poetry in Music), which was recently approved by the Brazilian Ministry of Culture,  in accordance with the Rouanet Law, article 26,  allowing us - according to the standards of ""Rouanet"" Law, article 26 - the sponsorship opportunity through Donations, Tax Waiver or Federal Tax Incentives to fundraising revolving around R$ 340,580.00,  around US$ 150,000.00. 
As still could not get a sponsor, I decided do this crowdfunding to reduce the amount required to 1/3, which is precisely what is necessary to start.


Cultural details of the project
In the next semester, we will launch our website "" POESIA NA MÚSICA"", presenting to the world the icons of Brazilian popular musical poetry and the history of our music. They will be listed by the decade in which they acted, from the 1920' icon and pioneer, Heitor Villa Lobos.
 Villa-Lobos engaged in what is the most significative popular music genre, featured in the most important group of Brazilian poet-musicians.  
Our project will be made available in both Portuguese and English, welcoming users from different parts of the world. We will also elaborate subtitled videos enabling the inclusion of the hearing and visually impaired.
There will be space for debates, sharing material about the subjects in the scope of the website and also poetry contests. A dynamic and practical way to spread knowledge and the perpetuation of our culture. 
The project aims at strengthening cultural, to be able in the near future, meet the social sphere.

Details of the Advertising Project
The website should attract around 2,000 to 6,000  viewers daily, generating around 800,000 monthly visits (see technical report issued by the Ministry of Culture attached). 





Technical report issued by the Ministry of Culture



This is the system that puts me in direct contact with Cultural Ministry-Brasilia (Salic Web), is where i do all the procedures, shipping documents, do spreadsheets, calculate budgets, payroll and some other things.

Doing a bit of effort you can calmly analyze the numbers and even data. The print was small, but you can get a sense of the magnitude of it.

Dear, I must say that I'm working for two long years, going for three in this system. I also researched a lot about social security and IRS because these types of projects go through a big supervision, the project can suffers audit if i fail and all my 2004 work to date can down the drain with my credentials.

Here you can see closer the specifications. Are in Portuguese, but I think there is nothing to worry about, since it is quite simple to understand.

As you can see, we need to cover all these areas with the best professionals.

Various multitudes of instruments have been crafted, such as didgeridoos, tuning forks, and song bowls, to channel the natural vibrations of the universe and return flow and pattern to the physical body. By merging technology and these ancient practices, we are able to create our own devices as incredible tools and visual aids that educate and inspire individuals on a variety of different levels. Since my own discovery of cymatics within the water I placed in my Tibetan bowls during my practice, I have delved deep into personal study, experimentation, and creation in an attempt to share this harmonious resonance with all.</span></p>

The purpose and scope of the cymagica art installation series is to give participants a multisensory comprehension of the sounds that are occurring all around and within them at any moment, in a live and interactive setting.

What is Cymatics?
Sound can be made visible through the vibration of various materials, from water to oils, to sugars and sands, creating resonance patterns that give rise to symmetry, form, and pattern, mimicking various cosmic functions from simple ripple effects, to spiraling galaxy formations, to the organization of cellular organisms… all can be seen within the patterns created by sound interference, showing the sacred resonant processes that shape and connect us all.
Why is this important?
Sound has been used for millennia as a healing force, mentally, physically, and spiritually. Various multitudes of instruments have been crafted, such as didgeridoos, tuning forks, and song bowls, to channel the natural vibrations of the universe and return flow and pattern to the physical body. By merging technology and these ancient practices, we are able to create our own devices as incredible tools and visual aids that educate and inspire individuals on a variety of different levels. Since my own discovery of cymatics within the water I placed in my Tibetan bowls during my practice, I have delved deep into personal study, experimentation, and creation in an attempt to share this harmonious resonance with all.

The Opportunity at hand
This year we have the unique experience to bring this project to life at an incredible event ~Gratifly Music and Arts Festival. We want to make this experience available to a large audience, and collaborate with live music being fed from the stages. The fruition of this project would add a physical visualization of sound at an event that until now has only been done with digital media. We will also be creating an entirely interactive area for YOU to come play!



Interaction with the crowd
We will be providing instruments from guitars to synthesizers, microphones, and other implements of sonic oscillation to allow participants to see their OWN vibrations reflected back at them, and we would love to invite any musician (vocalist, instrumentalist, or even DJ!) or non-musician alike to bring their gifts and instruments to patch into the sound board we will be providing. 

Humble Beginnings
What We Need
In order to create the installation we want to see, we need your help! By supporting this project, you are helping us to spread our passion and knowledge of cymatics with the world.
For Gratifly festival, we will be building a new cymatics device from the ground-up onsite. This requires materials such as powered amplifiers and speakers, waterproofing materials, and construction materials for the base of the device. We will also need to build a weather structure from bamboo and tarp.
To broadcast the imagery, we will need an HD projector and screen.We also need various vibratory media, such as fluids and particulate matter.
Here is a comprehensive list of our needs in an itemized budget.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_9c3woNwFRju5GXDHHBdMFUyzrfiW1bgIwvZjToeqa4/edit?usp=sharing
The materials we will be vibrating include:
Water
Fluorescent Dyes
Glycerine (non-palm)
Vegetable Oil (non-palm)
Quartz Sand
Non-Newtonian fluids
Isopropyl
And of course... YOU!
This will be our sixth event performing cymatics, from small to large events, and no other event quite encapsulates the energy that Gratifly provides. In the hills of Lake Hartwell in South Carolina, Gratifly provides a vessel for personal growth and experience unlike any other. Coming early and helping build the stage and temple last year was one of the most inspirational experiences of my life, and I witnessed firsthand the power of the individual and the group to build dream into reality. This spurred me to share my gift with the live music community in a secretly educational, highly interactive and inspirational space. We would love to come inspire and show others how powerful following your dreams can be! 

Thank you for your time and consideration! We're looking forward to playing around in our sonic playground with you. If you can't donate money, please consider donating your energy by sharing this campaign through social media.
See you at Gratifly! (((<3)))

<p>My name is Samoa. I was born in a small fishing village near Hiroshima, Japan. I moved to New York City in 1980 and became a pioneer of the East Village performance art scene, performing regularly in the Pyramid Club, Danceteria, Armageddon, ABC No Rio and other notorious underground spaces in the thriving art world of downtown 1980s New York. When I arrived to in NYC, I did not speak any English but I found a way to survive by being open and willing to try new things.  I am the co-founder and guitarist, with artist Kembra Pfahler, of the punk rock glam band <i>The Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black</i>. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I’ve been working with oil paint for more than 17 years with an emphasis on politics, social issues, portraits and pets – and all with a kitsch but humorous sensibility. There are so many more paintings that I want and need to create to fulfill my vision but  I've reached a point where I need your help to continue. The paintings I want to create will feature people who have lived on the edge, or <i>outside</i> of society, bravely, uniquely making their own path and creating legacies which provide hope and inspiration to people like me – people who feel different and have never been comfortable within the confines of social “norms” - outsiders like Bob Dylan, Andy Warhol, Kembra Pfahler, Antony Hegarty and Lou Reed.  Many of these creative pioneers died tragically and too young. All of them left enormous hope to people like me and made a strong mark on my mind and soul. Here's a shortlist of some of the inspiring people I want to paint:<br/></p>

<p>This is the biggest project I have ever undertaken. It is very important to remember, especially young people, that our mind is not owned by anyone...yet. I want to bring vibrant art once again to the forefront of this great city that I love. Please help me to achieve this goal by being a vital part of it. Your contribution to this project will help in very real, tangible ways by giving me the ability to purchase materials, supplies and most importantly, time, to finish these portraits, photograph them and make fine art digital Giclée prints of all the work. I hope to exhibit the finished paintings in 2016. </p>

<strong>Art Residency Station @ Ablon</strong> </h2>
<p>For the past <strong>20 years,</strong> the building of <em>l'ancienne gare marchande,</em> or the old freight loading station, in <strong>Ablon</strong> (just 15 minutes away from the centre of <strong>Paris</strong>, <strong>France)</strong>, has served as an atelier for artists from all over the world.</p>
<p><img alt=""ARS Ablon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://skroz.in/wp-content/uploads/boljaslika.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""ARS Ablon""/></p>
<h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
<p>Australian band <strong>Dirty Three</strong>, as well as their front man <strong>Warren Ellis</strong>; French band <strong>Ez3kiel</strong>, and Croatian band <strong>Darko Rundek &amp; his</strong> <strong>Cargo Orchestra</strong> (to name just a few) have all chosen the facilities to write, record and perform their music. Numerous visual, video and performing artists, writers, photographers, and designers have also been drawn to this unique creative space. The venue even hosted a birthday party for the esteemed French philosopher <strong>Alain Badiou, </strong>with the help of his colleague <strong>Jacques Rancière</strong>.</p>
<p>Ablon is close to Paris’ city centre, yet still completely isolated.It has a history as a birthplace for exquisite art and a thoroughly welcoming ambience. Its stone walls create an amazing acoustic. And, handily, there are no neighbors to complain about noise!</p>
<h2><strong>Clear and Present Danger</strong></h2>
<p>For the last two decades, the French branch of <strong>SKROZ</strong>, a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit under French law, has been leasing the building from the French Rail Network (RFF). In the last X years, maintenance costs have grown so high that <strong>SKROZ</strong> can no longer both care for the venue and offer it to artists at affordable fees.</p>
<p>Unless we can swiftly make <em>l'ancienne gare marchande</em> self-sustainable (and by “swiftly,” we mean within the next two months), the venue will be either <strong>torn down or converted into commercial storage</strong>. Yet another valuable and historic arts space will be lost.</p>
<p><em><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://skroz.in/wp-content/uploads/ablon_panorama.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<h2><strong>Future</strong></h2>
<p>We are now seeking vital support to not only preserve the Gare d’Ablon, but to turn it into a residency venue that will enable artists from all over the world to have a space in Paris, the arts capital of Europe, that can be used for both work and cultural events.</p>
<p>In order to achieve that, we need to renovate and refurbish the space.  It has to be made habitable as well as fun to work in. The necessary permits must be applied for and obtained.  Most importantly, we hope to build a network of supporters that will enable us to acquire the building from its current owner.</p>
<p>With your help, Ablon's currently single 100m<sup>2</sup> large and 8m high atelier, with separate kitchen and bathroom, would turn into a two-tiered double bedroom residency with a 100m<sup>2</sup> of co-working space, sound studio and a garden to match.</p>
<p>All improvements will be done to the highest environmental standards, and the mezzanine will be built exclusively out of re-usable wooden blocks in to create both warm &amp; functional environments, as well as keep the unique acoustics of the space.</p>
<p><img alt=""wooden building blocks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://skroz.in/wp-content/uploads/wood.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""wooden building blocks""/></p>
<p>Every three months, there will be an open call for applications, with successful applicants being offered a residency in Ablon, with lengths varying from a week to a month.</p>
<p>The residents would then be able to live and work in Ablon, just a 15 minutes RER C ride away from Place Saint Michel in Paris. The atelier is a delightful environment for workshops, presentations, meetings and social gatherings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will create a communication platform and a newsletter for the Art Residency Station @ Ablon alumni, so our past and future tenants can share both their work and plans, creating new partnerships on their own.</p>

<strong><em>About Ablon</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong>
</h2>
<p><em>Ablon-sur-Seine is a commune in the Val-de-Marne department in the southeastern suburbs of </em><em>Paris</em><em>, </em><em>France</em><em>. It is located 15.3 km (9.5 mi) from the center of </em><em>Paris</em><em> and 8km from the </em><em>Paris</em><em>Orly</em><em>Airport</em><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>First mentioned in the 12<sup>th</sup> century, Ablon developed as a trading port for timber, coal, and especially Beaujolais wine, but by the 19<sup>th</sup> century became a resort for the Parisians, a place where they came to spend their holydays and  swim in the Seine (while it was still clean). It has kept the same residential character to this day.</em></p>
<p><em>Ablon today has a couple of great boulangeries or bakeries, as well a great butcher shop, a bodega and a pharmacy, all within a walking distance of Gare’d Ablon.</em></p>
<p><em>There are also a number of restaurants in the neighborhood – Chinese, Japoneese, Portuguese and – of course – French.</em></p>

<p> </p>
<p>SKROZ in an art collective whose work is not limited to one medium, artistic discipline or genre. It is a group of authors working as a team to a maximum extent (ergo the name of the collective – SKROZ), in situations where authorship is a product of collective work or the ones where the limits of singular authorship can not be determined.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>SKROZ was founded by director Nora Krstulović and dramaturge Maja Sviben, later succeeded by Vedran Peternel, involving a large number of associates from various artistic disciplines, with its opus ranging from theatrical shows and performances (‘Brutalno, skroz’, ‘Ponedjeljkom, soba 303′, ‘Pop, skroz’, ‘Tamo i natrag’, ‘Tinta, let i topla voda’, ‘Opera za tri lipe’, ‘@BetaSkroz’, ‘Forrest, Timer, Hardly, Quite’),  to creations in a number of other mediums, especially on-line.</p>

For the past 20 years, the building of l'ancienne gare marchande, or the old freight loading station, in Ablon (just 15 minutes away from the centre of Paris, France), has served as an atelier for artists from all over the world.

History
Australian band Dirty Three, as well as their front man Warren Ellis; French band Ez3kiel, and Croatian band Darko Rundek & his Cargo Orchestra (to name just a few) have all chosen the facilities to write, record and perform their music. Numerous visual, video and performing artists, writers, photographers, and designers have also been drawn to this unique creative space. The venue even hosted a birthday party for the esteemed French philosopher Alain Badiou, with the help of his colleague Jacques Rancière.
Ablon is close to Paris’ city centre, yet still completely isolated.It has a history as a birthplace for exquisite art and a thoroughly welcoming ambience. Its stone walls create an amazing acoustic. And, handily, there are no neighbors to complain about noise!
Clear and Present Danger
For the last two decades, the French branch of SKROZ, a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit under French law, has been leasing the building from the French Rail Network (RFF). In the last X years, maintenance costs have grown so high that SKROZ can no longer both care for the venue and offer it to artists at affordable fees.
Unless we can swiftly make l'ancienne gare marchande self-sustainable (and by “swiftly,” we mean within the next two months), the venue will be either torn down or converted into commercial storage. Yet another valuable and historic arts space will be lost.

Future
We are now seeking vital support to not only preserve the Gare d’Ablon, but to turn it into a residency venue that will enable artists from all over the world to have a space in Paris, the arts capital of Europe, that can be used for both work and cultural events.
In order to achieve that, we need to renovate and refurbish the space.  It has to be made habitable as well as fun to work in. The necessary permits must be applied for and obtained.  Most importantly, we hope to build a network of supporters that will enable us to acquire the building from its current owner.
With your help, Ablon's currently single 100m2 large and 8m high atelier, with separate kitchen and bathroom, would turn into a two-tiered double bedroom residency with a 100m2 of co-working space, sound studio and a garden to match.
All improvements will be done to the highest environmental standards, and the mezzanine will be built exclusively out of re-usable wooden blocks in to create both warm & functional environments, as well as keep the unique acoustics of the space.

Every three months, there will be an open call for applications, with successful applicants being offered a residency in Ablon, with lengths varying from a week to a month.
The residents would then be able to live and work in Ablon, just a 15 minutes RER C ride away from Place Saint Michel in Paris. The atelier is a delightful environment for workshops, presentations, meetings and social gatherings.
Furthermore, we will create a communication platform and a newsletter for the Art Residency Station @ Ablon alumni, so our past and future tenants can share both their work and plans, creating new partnerships on their own.

About Ablon 

Ablon-sur-Seine is a commune in the Val-de-Marne department in the southeastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 15.3 km (9.5 mi) from the center of Paris and 8km from the ParisOrlyAirport.
First mentioned in the 12th century, Ablon developed as a trading port for timber, coal, and especially Beaujolais wine, but by the 19th century became a resort for the Parisians, a place where they came to spend their holydays and  swim in the Seine (while it was still clean). It has kept the same residential character to this day.
Ablon today has a couple of great boulangeries or bakeries, as well a great butcher shop, a bodega and a pharmacy, all within a walking distance of Gare’d Ablon.
There are also a number of restaurants in the neighborhood – Chinese, Japoneese, Portuguese and – of course – French.

<h3>Hi I'm Tobin Louise Reimer, help me make books and prints!</h3>
<p>I'm starting on online store to sell my work and also have been accepted into the art fair that corresponds with Pop Montréal and need help covering the printing costs for these endeavors. I am a 24 year old artist living in Montréal whose work explores femininity, gender, nature, solitude, and relationships. I work in pencil, ink and watercolour primarily, in a delicate, illustrative style. I am making two books, one a collaboration with Noe Bagshaw about the uncomfortable sides of athletics and womanhood, and another illustrations of Greek Myths.</p>
<p>I graduated from Emily Carr University in 2011 in Visual Arts and have been working on drawings and paintings since then. I have participated in numerous shows in British Columbia, the Yukon, and now Quebec! I am working hard on the drawings for these publications but need help kicking off the printing costs. The more money I raise, the better the books will look, and maybe I can send you one! Books are a great way to showcase art and house ideas, can be shared with your friends, are light and portable, and fun! </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I'm going to be printing two books, one illustrations of Greek myths, and another with my fellow artist Noe Bagshaw exploring the complexities of femininity, the awkwardness of athletics, and the trials and tribulations of living in a bilingual city.<br/>I need $500 so I have enough books to sell at Puces Pop, the art fair that I am participating in, as well as making high quality art prints of various other works to sell. The books and the prints will also be available on my online store for purchase. This will also help cover the cost of promotional items such as business cards and postcards. </p>
<p>Depending on how much you pledge, you will receive a postcard, a book, or even a unique piece of art. Your contribution will help me, as an artist, focus on my art and not have to worry about where funding is coming from. </p>
<p>As a young working artist, it is often hard to financially back your endeavors while having time to work on them. Ideally, these are fused, but being an artist early in my career, I haven't reached this goal yet. I am pursuing a career in illustration and this will be a great venue for me to spread the word and meet a lot of people, especially with your help! <br/><br/>I am always working on new drawings and right now I would like to take action to publish two small volumes that will collect and document some exciting collections of new images and artworks! The books will be soft-cover zines, with sewn bindings and clear printing. The prints will be on archival artist paper so that they last and you can continue to enjoy them in years to come. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Being an artist, I must rely somewhat on the public to help continue doing what I love and sharing it with people that I love! Please help me reach my goal! Please share this campaign with others, and and if you're in Montréal, come see me at Puces Pop on May 31st! <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/140907449429174/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/events/140907449429174/</a></p>

BilletSPIN, here! </p><p>When we sat down to create something new for you, our one goal was to take precision top design to another level. Machining together pieces made of different materials to create a balanced, long-spinning top takes care, expertise, and a superior level of craftsmanship.</p><p>Complex designs like these are one of our specialties, so when it came to pushing limits, this is where we pressed. We could have stopped at a 2-piece design. Three? Now four would be amazing, but we couldn't stop there!</p><p>We are very pleased to introduce you to the Matrix, a precision top made of 9 PIECES!!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490882174/wvdy2unszfyveaihh8pm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>The Design</h2><p>That is not a typo. The Matrix is made up of 9 separate pieces! To put that in context, our best-selling top, the K2, was 3 pieces. The additional pieces of the Matrix are so expertly balanced that its performance isn't hindered by the complexity--both boast similar top spin times of about 7-10 minutes in our tests.</p><p><strong>See for yourself!

Each serration on the grip is individually machined. Below the grip, we feature a ""barbed wire"" pattern to complement the aggressive style of the design!</p><p>In order to give the Matrix the best performance and durability, we chose to use a Tungsten Carbide bearing ball for the contact point.

BilletSPIN, here! When we sat down to create something new for you, our one goal was to take precision top design to another level. Machining together pieces made of different materials to create a balanced, long-spinning top takes care, expertise, and a superior level of craftsmanship.Complex designs like these are one of our specialties, so when it came to pushing limits, this is where we pressed. We could have stopped at a 2-piece design. Three? Now four would be amazing, but we couldn't stop there!We are very pleased to introduce you to the Matrix, a precision top made of 9 PIECES!!The DesignThat is not a typo. The Matrix is made up of 9 separate pieces! To put that in context, our best-selling top, the K2, was 3 pieces. The additional pieces of the Matrix are so expertly balanced that its performance isn't hindered by the complexity--both boast similar top spin times of about 7-10 minutes in our tests.See for yourself! Full Length Spin video:So, what are the 9 pieces? There are 4 main components: two outer collars, an inner disc, and a stem. The two outer collars are aligned using 5 stainless steel dowel pins.These pins align the spoke patterns on each collar and the diagonal hash marks on the outside perimeters. Next we focused on the stem. It needed to have a great grip yet fit well with the overall theme of the top.On the top of the stem sits a 5-point star that is hand aligned to the spoke pattern on the outer collar. Each serration on the grip is individually machined. Below the grip, we feature a ""barbed wire"" pattern to complement the aggressive style of the design!In order to give the Matrix the best performance and durability, we chose to use a Tungsten Carbide bearing ball for the contact point. Through extensive testing, we have found this to be the absolute best material for this purpose!The Matrix is 1.2"" in diameter and weighs between 50-60 grams. The Matrix is offered exclusively on Indiegogo in standard material combinations. Each of the 25 different material combinations boasts its own visual appeal as well as a unique weight and feel. Made from stainless steel (SS), copper (Cu), and/or bronze (Br), the combinations take on a life of their own.  Here at BilletSPIN, we pride ourselves on making precision tops to the highest of quality standards. Due to the amount of machining and material fluctuations, your Matrix may experience a slight flutter. We will not refund or replace due to flutter. Thank you.See the perks on the right side of the screen for full material descriptions. Materials are listed from outside to inside (outer collar/inner disc/stem). Video of all 25 combos: How to orderReady to order? On the right side of the page, you will see a list of perks.

The estimated delivery for these tops is in July, 2017.  Here at BilletSPIN, we're proud of reliably fulfilling all of our campaigns. Customer service is a top priority for us, so please reach out if you have any questions! About UsMy name is Rich Stadler. I've been a machinist for over 25 years, and for me, there is nothing better than finding what is hiding in a raw bar of material. My passion for creating functional art with metal drove me to start BilletSPIN in March, 2015. In 2016, it became my full-time job.

Accordingly, such aspects are important to us when, as content creators, we use quite a lot of paper: to write, to sketch, to keep a schedule or gather memories. That’s why in the summer of 2018 we started working on items for ourselves, putting to use our experience in design, art, and handcraft. At first it was a simple hobby. But as friends grew interested in our stuff and broader circles started asking if it’s available anywhere, this hobby turned into a real project. What you can see is the fruit of our intense work.</p><p>We’re wzornik, and we’re here to bring you a functional, ethically made, and beautifully crafted range of paper goods.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544097608/frmtgvrntcmbe5d2haec.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Let us introduce our first collection: <i>closer</i>. Designed with both functionality and sensory pleasure in mind, it includes two types of sketchbooks, where each type features three covers to choose from. All items were crafted by us at home, allowing us to care for every detail, resulting in an entirely Earth-friendly production.</p><p><strong>The<i> </i>thinner type</strong> is made of 32 pages, neatly contained in citrus paper with a screenprinted design where each variant refers to a different summer mood. Handy, conveniently sized, and easy to carry around. The inside pages, all 100g/m, are made of corn paper, giving a lovely to touch rough texture with visible pieces. When it comes to our personal needs, we find it perfectly suited for quick notes, drafts, rough sketches and short thoughts. We kept the block blank - no lines, grids, or dots, so that you could fill it entirely as you prefer.</p><p><strong>The thicker<i> </i>type</strong> has double the amount of space - it includes 64 corn pages of the same density and texture as the thinner one. Binded in a way which specifically allows for a flat opening so that every part of each spread can be used. There are three color variants for covers: either made from cherries, lavender or olives. In this sketchbook we focused on frugality, enhancing the functionality of the product. For this reason, we left the spine visible. It’s ideal for sketches, concepts, small illustrations, journaling and scrapbooking.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544097626/klkxtvxcduyuwe1esuqs.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We took extreme care to choose <strong>the finest materials</strong>: what you get is not only high quality, but also produced without negative impact on your environment and surroundings.</p><p><strong>All the paper we use</strong> contains organic by-products which replace up to 15 percent of virgin tree pulp typically used in standard paper production. It’s FSC-certified, GMO-free, contains post-consumer recycled waste (40%)  and is produced with EKOenergy, resulting in a 20% reduction in carbon footprint. That’s not the only thing which makes it our number one choice, obviously.

Accordingly, such aspects are important to us when, as content creators, we use quite a lot of paper: to write, to sketch, to keep a schedule or gather memories. That’s why in the summer of 2018 we started working on items for ourselves, putting to use our experience in design, art, and handcraft. At first it was a simple hobby. But as friends grew interested in our stuff and broader circles started asking if it’s available anywhere, this hobby turned into a real project. What you can see is the fruit of our intense work.We’re wzornik, and we’re here to bring you a functional, ethically made, and beautifully crafted range of paper goods.Let us introduce our first collection: closer. Designed with both functionality and sensory pleasure in mind, it includes two types of sketchbooks, where each type features three covers to choose from. All items were crafted by us at home, allowing us to care for every detail, resulting in an entirely Earth-friendly production.The thinner type is made of 32 pages, neatly contained in citrus paper with a screenprinted design where each variant refers to a different summer mood. Handy, conveniently sized, and easy to carry around. The inside pages, all 100g/m, are made of corn paper, giving a lovely to touch rough texture with visible pieces. When it comes to our personal needs, we find it perfectly suited for quick notes, drafts, rough sketches and short thoughts. We kept the block blank - no lines, grids, or dots, so that you could fill it entirely as you prefer.The thicker type has double the amount of space - it includes 64 corn pages of the same density and texture as the thinner one. Binded in a way which specifically allows for a flat opening so that every part of each spread can be used. There are three color variants for covers: either made from cherries, lavender or olives. In this sketchbook we focused on frugality, enhancing the functionality of the product. For this reason, we left the spine visible. It’s ideal for sketches, concepts, small illustrations, journaling and scrapbooking.We took extreme care to choose the finest materials: what you get is not only high quality, but also produced without negative impact on your environment and surroundings.All the paper we use contains organic by-products which replace up to 15 percent of virgin tree pulp typically used in standard paper production. It’s FSC-certified, GMO-free, contains post-consumer recycled waste (40%)  and is produced with EKOenergy, resulting in a 20% reduction in carbon footprint. That’s not the only thing which makes it our number one choice, obviously. As we really care about how well different tools perform on it, we’re happy to say that it’s perfect for a vast variety of fineliners, fountain pens, water-based markers, ink tools, pencils and crayons.Screenprinting, or serigraphy if you like, is another part of our production.

<h3>We're Joy Dept., a group of grad students who believe in inspiring joyful human interaction. We're raising funds to help pay for the technology and materials needed to prototype and build our thesis project.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Picture this: it’s a cool summer evening, somewhere in the Colorado wilderness. You hear gentle pops and crackles coming from a fire, then the familiar muffled laughter of your closest friends. You smell the sweet, damp grass, the earthy pine logs burning in the fire, and even a hint of toasted marshmallows.</p>
<p><strong>We want to recreate this familiar experience by designing an interactive public art installation.</strong> In doing this, we hope to bring people together, first by curiosity, then with delight, and then, through connection.</p>
<p>This one-of-a-kind interactive installation, themed like a campsite, will build and scale as more people participate. As more people join in, sensors will trigger sound and light, the flames of ""campfire"" will grow bigger and brighter, and other thematic stimuli will surprise and delight.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Every spring the seniors of the MSU BFA program travel to Los Angeles to participate in the showcase that highlights our quality education and training. The important part of showcase are those who attend, LA Film and Theatre industry professionals and Missouri State alumni, giving the alumni the feeling that they left MSU in good, passionate hands and giving the industry pros the opportunity to give us our shot as we seek representation from them. That being said, its hard to get word out for those who work in the industry to come and see us at our showcase, this is where you can step in and help us achieve our goals. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">Your help comes into play here: Alumni panels, publicity, postcard invitations, mailing hundreds of head shots and resumes that we will be sending to industry professionals costs A LOT of money and it's what we spend all of our fundraising on. Every cent we earn goes directly to affording this.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Your money is important so you need to know why its helping not only us but you as well. By contributing to our success at showcase you will be contributing to the future of art and all its forms, every single person you have seen in this video are passionate and driven. Our dreams and achievements, through your help, will be providing a future for our artistic community and those to come. Those who will continue to create and inspire others for all to enjoy. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Yes, every time we are asked what our majors are we get that ""Good Luck"" glance with our response.  People will always say we're crazy, but if you reference the top once again, we already know. Their will be plenty of challenges on the road ahead: officially moving to our major cities, getting representation, finding work, you name it. None of this is an easy task, AND our training that we have all received from Missouri State University is giving us the best foot forward to making these leaps and bounds happen. Between our abilities as actors and the knowledge of the field as it currently stands are our best weapons in the arsenal as we take on our future. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Every spring the seniors of the MSU BFA program travel to Los Angeles to participate in the showcase that highlights our quality education and training. The important part of showcase are those who attend, LA Film and Theatre industry professionals and Missouri State alumni, giving the alumni the feeling that they left MSU in good, passionate hands and giving the industry pros the opportunity to give us our shot as we seek representation from them. That being said, its hard to get word out for those who work in the industry to come and see us at our showcase, this is where you can step in and help us achieve our goals. 

What We Need & What You Get
Your help comes into play here: Alumni panels, publicity, postcard invitations, mailing hundreds of head shots and resumes that we will be sending to industry professionals costs A LOT of money and it's what we spend all of our fundraising on. Every cent we earn goes directly to affording this.

The Impact
Your money is important so you need to know why its helping not only us but you as well. By contributing to our success at showcase you will be contributing to the future of art and all its forms, every single person you have seen in this video are passionate and driven. Our dreams and achievements, through your help, will be providing a future for our artistic community and those to come. Those who will continue to create and inspire others for all to enjoy. 

Risks & Challenges
Yes, every time we are asked what our majors are we get that ""Good Luck"" glance with our response.  People will always say we're crazy, but if you reference the top once again, we already know. Their will be plenty of challenges on the road ahead: officially moving to our major cities, getting representation, finding work, you name it. None of this is an easy task, AND our training that we have all received from Missouri State University is giving us the best foot forward to making these leaps and bounds happen. Between our abilities as actors and the knowledge of the field as it currently stands are our best weapons in the arsenal as we take on our future. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, we totally understand; we're poor college kids, we get it. But you can help us by spreading the word. By sharing and passing the message along we can keep pushing forward as we reach our goals. All we ask is that you stay tuned in with us and follow us on our social medias as Showcase comes near.

<p>My name is Camila Salcedo, I am an art student in Halifax, NS. One of my main art interests is performance art. My work primarily deals with the complex layers of being a Latina immigrant living in Canada. The intersectionality of my identity as a racialized, white-passing body has lead me to create work focused on feminism, political activism, sexuality and Venezuelan-Canadian cultural identity. </p>
<p>La Pocha Nostra is a 10-day International Performance Workshop taking place in Mérida, México in January of 2017. This workshop is led by Guillermo Gomez-Peña, a well-known Chicano performance artist. This year, I was selected as one of the 10 international artists that will join another 10 Mexican artists in the workshop. The workshop focuses and centres marginalized voices, creating an emphasis on art about race, ethnicity and cultural identity. Sharing a space and creating with fellow international performance artists, who are radical and like-minded, is going to be an amazing opportunity for me as an emerging artist.</p>
<p>As a student, this workshop would be quite expensive for me to participate in, and this is why I need financial help to be able to pay for the tuition ($850), flights ($800-1000) and accommodation ($400-800). The $2000, that I am hoping to raise through this campaign, will go towards covering those costs.<br/><br/>I travelled to Mexico City for the first time this past summer; It was the first time I had ever travelled alone. Travelling to Mexico as a young woman was very significant to me because I had never been back to Latin America since moving to Canada in 2007. Visiting the country made me feel a sense of home that I hadn’t felt in a very long time—I was able to speak my first language and I was able to connect with a culture that was more similar to my own. Having the ability to travel back to Mexico where I can participate in and create at La Pocha Nostra is my absolute dream!<br/><br/>By contributing to my campaign and helping me achieve my goal, you will be receiving hand crafted tropical-inspired objects!<br/><br/>Without this help I will not be able to fully afford to participate in this workshop and will be forced to take on debt that I simply cannot afford. If you are unable to contribute with money, please contribute by sharing widely with your communities. I would really appreciate it.</p>

<p>I'm Melanie Daniels, 65 year old community artist, (papermaker, printmaker, bookmaker, lately folkmonkey maker), educator and now a builder.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to see this campaign site.</p>
<p><strong>So what have I built in the past?</strong></p>
<p>Good question. My last project was founding and directing an inner city art school, Taproots, for 14 years, that reused a closed, 25,000 sq. ft. school building. Students came to our art programs from 32 different zip codes.</p>
I retired a few years ago and began my quest to create a personal and community creative space where I could make my art and others could join me making theirs.   I generated savings of $4,000 from a program that helps women develop assets and with that small sum I began building the studio.<strong><br/></strong>
</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong>How long has this been going on?</strong></div>
<div>I have been working on this ""green"" building for four years ( going on year 5  counting the training, clearing the site, finding local timberframers, and weather complications) with the help of neighbors, friends and passerbys.</div>
<div> 
<div><strong>Community Involvement<br/></strong></div>
A long with friends and neighbors I partnered with Missouri Botanical Gardens' Earthways Center in 2009 we held a cordwood building class on my site, 8 students, 5 helpers and instructors from the Earthwood School, Rob and Jaki Roy worked for three days to kick off building the walls of the studio. In 2010 some 78 people donated work or materials to the project and in 2011 another 61 people joined in.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><em>Now having used all my savings over the 5 years and I am out of funds and nearly out of time to get this first floor completed in this race against the weather.</em></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The mortar in the walls can't be used once freezing weather arrives. I am so close - 70% done with the walls</div>
<div>Your contribution can help me win this race with the weather and start moving my equipment inside so I can begin earning my living again as an artist.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>What Is Needed:</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>$6,000 to hire help for the next four weeks to work with me and mortar the logs into the remaining two walls and the last few feet at the top of the other three;</li>
<li>$650 to buy the 5,000 pounds of lime  and 10,000 pounds of sand for the mortar</li>
<li>$900 for electricity/lighting</li>
<li>$1,000 to buy a composting toilet</li>
<li>$ 600 a clean up sink/ shower</li>
<li>$300 for labor and materials to frame out 10 windows and 2 doors</li>
<li>$500 an electric energy efficient freestanding heater</li>
<li>$2,200 flooring</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><strong>Green Building?</strong></div>
<div>The Cordwood building process is labor intensive but yields a very energy efficient building with a insulation factor of R-23 due to 16"" thick walls and a 10"" thermal break space filled with cedar sawdust from a local cedar sawmill. I have used recycled windows, doors, outlet boxes and flex pipe from ReStore of Habitat for Humanity, Craigs List and recycling centers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All the 400 cedar logs used to create the walls have been saved from land where they would have been burned as scrap. The timbers for the posts supports are remilled cyprus telephone posts and the posts for the timberframe have been purchased from local sawmills, part of the flooring is made of boards from salvaged pipe crates donated by a neighbor.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Impact</strong></div>
<div>This building will of course have a huge impact on me personally as I can finally set up my etching press, papermaking equipment and bookmaking materials and begin making my living from my work.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Having this art studio in our village will be like having an art incubator that will nurture the creativity of all who join me in making their art.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anytime we increase creativity everything and everyone around us benefits as well.<strong><br/></strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are five closet artists on my road in this village who are waking up to their talents now that they have helped me work on this studio and probably many others as I come in contact with the other 100 homeowners here. My point is that when people gather together their creativity is supported and increases- the benefits go way beyond the walls of the studio!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Perks You will Receive (See Gallery for photos)<br/></strong></div>
<div><ol>
<li>$10 Instant Fame + Thank You</li>
<li>$15 Bookmaking Kit</li>
<li>$25 Original Photo Postcards</li>
<li>$55 Video: Making of the Studio</li>

<li>$95 Two Original Giclee Prints</li>

Thank you for coming to see this campaign site.
So what have I built in the past?
Good question. My last project was founding and directing an inner city art school, Taproots, for 14 years, that reused a closed, 25,000 sq. ft. school building. Students came to our art programs from 32 different zip codes.
I retired a few years ago and began my quest to create a personal and community creative space where I could make my art and others could join me making theirs.   I generated savings of $4,000 from a program that helps women develop assets and with that small sum I began building the studio.

 
How long has this been going on?
I have been working on this ""green"" building for four years ( going on year 5  counting the training, clearing the site, finding local timberframers, and weather complications) with the help of neighbors, friends and passerbys.
 
Community Involvement
A long with friends and neighbors I partnered with Missouri Botanical Gardens' Earthways Center in 2009 we held a cordwood building class on my site, 8 students, 5 helpers and instructors from the Earthwood School, Rob and Jaki Roy worked for three days to kick off building the walls of the studio. In 2010 some 78 people donated work or materials to the project and in 2011 another 61 people joined in.
 
Now having used all my savings over the 5 years and I am out of funds and nearly out of time to get this first floor completed in this race against the weather.
 
The mortar in the walls can't be used once freezing weather arrives. I am so close - 70% done with the walls
Your contribution can help me win this race with the weather and start moving my equipment inside so I can begin earning my living again as an artist.
 
What Is Needed:


$6,000 to hire help for the next four weeks to work with me and mortar the logs into the remaining two walls and the last few feet at the top of the other three;
$650 to buy the 5,000 pounds of lime  and 10,000 pounds of sand for the mortar
$900 for electricity/lighting
$1,000 to buy a composting toilet
$ 600 a clean up sink/ shower
$300 for labor and materials to frame out 10 windows and 2 doors
$500 an electric energy efficient freestanding heater
$2,200 flooring


Green Building?
The Cordwood building process is labor intensive but yields a very energy efficient building with a insulation factor of R-23 due to 16"" thick walls and a 10"" thermal break space filled with cedar sawdust from a local cedar sawmill. I have used recycled windows, doors, outlet boxes and flex pipe from ReStore of Habitat for Humanity, Craigs List and recycling centers.

Anytime we increase creativity everything and everyone around us benefits as well.

 
There are five closet artists on my road in this village who are waking up to their talents now that they have helped me work on this studio and probably many others as I come in contact with the other 100 homeowners here. My point is that when people gather together their creativity is supported and increases- the benefits go way beyond the walls of the studio!

<p> </p></span></span></div>","We are creating a large mural on the North Wall of the Odd Fellows building in downtown Sebastopol. 










The theme, based on a Kashaya
Pomo story details how Coyote the Trickster created the  Sonoma coastline by the unintended
consequences of his actions. This  mural about the origins of the
landscape has a bit of spiritual magic, a beautiful scene and a story that
comes from the very roots of this area. We are inviting the community to assist
us at a Community Paint Day September 22, and to be part of the crowd funding process. To date, our fundraising efforts, including in-kind donations, have totaled $26,000 of a $30,000
budget.  We are seeking an additional
$4,000 to cover scaffolding, primer and varnish costs to complete and
install the mural by October 15, 2013.

<p><strong>Hi, my name is Candice and I am a potter.</strong></p>
<p>I have been working with clay, throwing porcelain and stoneware; and teaching for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>I am trying to set up a studio at home to continue my work. I have a lovely small space in the heart of the Ashdown Forest, UK.  I have spent time, money and effort to get the studio up and running. I have restored the original stables, added a window, built a retaining wall in the garden and bought a kiln. I have two wheels, tools and my hands</p>
<p><strong>What I don’t have is electricity to power my kiln or lights and plugs in the studio.</strong></p>
<p>I need $3500 to cover the cost of upgrading my electric supply board, and to lay a cable to the studio capable of firing the kiln to 1260 degrees Celsius. I have obtained four quotes and they <strong>ALL</strong> equal the same amount…$3500. It sounds a lot, but without it I cannot follow my dream.</p>
<p>My dream is to produce beautiful ceramics, share my skills through lessons and weekend- retreat classes, introducing people to the therapeutic benefits of expressing their creative self. My aim is to establish a creative space for small groups to enjoy working with clay.</p>
<p>My incredible children, talented nephew and endlessly supportive husband have helped me put together this appeal. If I can get this to work it will change the life of my family, allowing us to move out of a difficult time and use my skills to enhance our lives.</p>
<p>Your contributions will be used to install electrics to the studio…To allow me to turn on the lights!</p>
<p><strong>It doesn’t need to stop there</strong>.</p>
<p>I would use any additional funding to buy another wheel or two, and to buy raw materials; clay, glazes, a raku kiln, and do some advertising for my classes.</p>
<p>I could never ask this of you without offering something in return, so, I will be offering incentives for your support, including lumpy memorabilia, slab and hand thrown porcelain or stoneware, and personalised tableware. I will also be offering lessons as reward if you are local. Come along and have a coffee and enrich yourself making something beautiful.</p>
<p>I understand if you yourself cannot contribute to this fundraiser. However, I do ask that you share this campaign through your own networks, be it Facebook, Twitter, etc. to get the word out!</p>
<p>Many thanks for your support.</p>
<p>All Contributors will join the wall of fame and get their name embossed on the studio wall in gold! Watch this space for updates. The bigger your contribution the bigger your name!</p>
<p><strong>Examples of rewards: </strong>These <strong>can only</strong> be fired if I reach my total!</p>
<p>I will be making small hanging lizards, stars, hearts and angels,which will be  scented.</p>
<p>Also, I will throw gift-bowls, hand decorated, or personalised, with a name or phrase…perfect for dinner-party gifts, or wedding favours. Specific quantities can be made to order. Quantity and detail will be dependent on your contributions.</p>

Our Story
'GLOBAl ArtXchanges' was formed about 2 years ago, here in Thunder Bay, Canada. 

I am Art Director/co-ordinator, Vesa Peltonen, who is an award winning visual artist/teacher. I have helped aboriginal students gain confidence through art. I received this award due to my many years of work in many aspects of art and as an entrepreneur, volunteering and working as an advisor for our province art council. I have been most honoured, but awards are not what I seek, it's watching my efforts work, seeing that young art students become happier, confident & motivated -sustained in their artwork needs. 

It is much about caring, compassion and determination. 'GLOBAL ArtXchanges; is meant to 'enrich the lives' of the youth who are in needy art groups and small art schools world-wide that do not have the resources to have proper art supplies. We do not send money. We only send the art supplies the contact person, director, or teacher requests. Once we see all is proper, we make sure they receive it. Money sent has less chance of going to the right place.  

Note  of Importance: 'GLOBAL ArtXchanges' already networked in Jugla, Ghana & sent them for art supplies. They sent us artwork by young students did. It was an incredible feeling, and it was most successful. They are now sustaining this art program, and we do the follow up. The artwork that we get from each place we touch will be apart of an exhibition showing 'International Youth Art' we have collected, one culmination and apart of the ongoing work. We've already put in money, & will receive funds from other sources, such as grants and special art council funding. We need $40K as we go.
The Impact

The impact is that not only do the young artists benefit, but also do their family, friends and community. The community begins to share in the responsibility to sustain this effort. Since the young artists have proper art supplies to work with, this puts smiles on the faces of everyone. Having family and teachers begin to share in the responsibility of motivating their youth thus enriches the spirit in people and involving many in this focus of the future of their children's education. ""No one can take a young person’s imagination away."" as is said. What We Need & What You Get


We need to reach a minimum fundraising effort of $12,000. (U.S.D) Once we have worked into many poor/needy world art groups we will have an international exhibition of their work 'called 'Compassion Through Art.. YOU WILL BENEFIT from the news we send to you about the ongoing efforts, where your funds have gone to, see photographs to art, to a final documentary short film.

Look NOW in the Donations we need & what each one you choose GIVE YOU for your generosity.

One year of Italian history told by Mother Nature. The daily breath of life of the mutant man, the internal struggle and the opposing forces of the roots and wings. Nature speacks and imposes her purifying aesthetics. An animist and pagan revenge, an artistic declaration of religiousness. An unprecedented narrative language, a story with many voices, the art of cinema to remind us that the word is not the most trivial language we have. A film which teaches how to use hands, eyes, ears and heart. Go out of the office and metro and look for this film. You’ll find yourself with wet nostrils, an extended neck and streched ears. It’s a unique experience for your senses.

<h3>Help The Only Female Team out of 200 Artists To Paint at UpFest!</h3>
<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong></p>
<p>   Artists <strong>Danielle Mastrion &amp; Lexi Bella</strong> met in 2008 during the Femme Fatale Art Battle (a live art competition) and began a friendship &amp; shared respect that has brought them to a new level in their work. For many years both ladies traveled within  the live &amp; street art circles of downtown New York, seeking to create bigger &amp; better art as well as teach &amp; mentor young artists by teaching programs for The Lower East Side Girl's Club &amp; Wingspan Arts.</p>
<p>    2012 was a milestone year for both artists with their careers blossoming, doing work that garnered them international attention. They were both in the ArtBattles huge Pop Up Art Gallery on Bleeker Street in Greenwhich Village; both exhibited in <em>5 Raw,</em><em> </em>a landmark show at Gallery Bar in the Lower East Side last Summer; both participated in the Centre-Fuge Public Mural Project twice, with <strong>Danielle's Tribute to the Beastie Boys being featured on <a href=""http://RollingStone.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RollingStone.com</a>.</strong> Between the two of them they have painted walls in locations such as <strong> 5 Poinz Living Graffiti Museum, The Brooklyn Collective (Formerly The Bushwick 5 Points), at Art Basel Miami 2013, in Berlin, Paris, &amp; The North Philly Walls. Both artists traveled to Paris together</strong> last Fall to compete in ArtBattles 2012 International Championships with 8 other artists from NYC, LA, Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam, &amp; Warsaw. They both won the first round, &amp; Lexi won the Amercan Championship. To get to the international round, both ladies have won several ArtBattles in New York City, garnishing spots in the International battles to represent America &amp; New York City. Both ladies also were part of <strong>Fountain Art Fair</strong> this year, the art world's most anticipated NYC Art Fair during the Armory Show. Now they are ready to go back across the pond &amp; paint their designated 10 X 10 Ft Wall &amp; show them how NYC does it!</p>

<p><strong>What is UpFest:</strong></p>
<p><strong>   Upfest - The Urban Paint Festival,</strong> created in 2008 between three crazy but art loving individuals. Inspired by Super Cans (Southampton), Cans Festival (London) and the growing number of paint jams around the UK, Upfest was born. </p>
<p>  With over <strong>1000 artists applying &amp; 200 being accepted</strong> for 2013, Upfest has turned into the <strong>biggest international Live &amp; Street (Urban) Art Festival in Europe</strong> and is creating a format soon to be but not yet replicated in the States. inside and outside music stages at full volume with 10X10 ft walls constructed all over for registered artists to paint, South Bristol turns in to the place to be for all things street for <strong>48hrs of 'Live' Urban and Contemporary Art.</strong>       </p>
<p>  Over the last three festivals <strong>Upfest has worked with a local charity called Nacoa</strong>, this amazing charity support many children across the UK, who live with alcohol or drug dependant family members. We would like to thank all the artists that attend for helping us <strong>raise over £15,000 so far for Nacoa</strong> and just as important, raise awareness of the vital work they do.</p>

Who We Are:
   Artists Danielle Mastrion & Lexi Bella met in 2008 during the Femme Fatale Art Battle (a live art competition) and began a friendship & shared respect that has brought them to a new level in their work. For many years both ladies traveled within  the live & street art circles of downtown New York, seeking to create bigger & better art as well as teach & mentor young artists by teaching programs for The Lower East Side Girl's Club & Wingspan Arts.
    2012 was a milestone year for both artists with their careers blossoming, doing work that garnered them international attention. They were both in the ArtBattles huge Pop Up Art Gallery on Bleeker Street in Greenwhich Village; both exhibited in 5 Raw, a landmark show at Gallery Bar in the Lower East Side last Summer; both participated in the Centre-Fuge Public Mural Project twice, with Danielle's Tribute to the Beastie Boys being featured on RollingStone.com. Between the two of them they have painted walls in locations such as  5 Poinz Living Graffiti Museum, The Brooklyn Collective (Formerly The Bushwick 5 Points), at Art Basel Miami 2013, in Berlin, Paris, & The North Philly Walls. Both artists traveled to Paris together last Fall to compete in ArtBattles 2012 International Championships with 8 other artists from NYC, LA, Paris, Barcelona, Amsterdam, & Warsaw. They both won the first round, & Lexi won the Amercan Championship. To get to the international round, both ladies have won several ArtBattles in New York City, garnishing spots in the International battles to represent America & New York City. Both ladies also were part of Fountain Art Fair this year, the art world's most anticipated NYC Art Fair during the Armory Show. Now they are ready to go back across the pond & paint their designated 10 X 10 Ft Wall & show them how NYC does it!

What is UpFest:
   Upfest - The Urban Paint Festival, created in 2008 between three crazy but art loving individuals. Inspired by Super Cans (Southampton), Cans Festival (London) and the growing number of paint jams around the UK, Upfest was born. 
  With over 1000 artists applying & 200 being accepted for 2013, Upfest has turned into the biggest international Live & Street (Urban) Art Festival in Europe and is creating a format soon to be but not yet replicated in the States. inside and outside music stages at full volume with 10X10 ft walls constructed all over for registered artists to paint, South Bristol turns in to the place to be for all things street for 48hrs of 'Live' Urban and Contemporary Art.       
  Over the last three festivals Upfest has worked with a local charity called Nacoa, this amazing charity support many children across the UK, who live with alcohol or drug dependant family members. We would like to thank all the artists that attend for helping us raise over £15,000 so far for Nacoa and just as important, raise awareness of the vital work they do.

@upfest
   These ladies are the only all-female team asked out of 200 artists from all over the world to paint at UpFest! Gender does not matter in regards to art, capabilities, or talent; BUT we are looking to inspire young female artists via the Lower East Side Girl's Club, as listed below: 
WE ARE ALSO DEDICATING THE WORK WE CREATE TO THE LOWER EAST SIDE GIRLS CLUB AND WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO YOUNG WOMEN THERE ABOUT OUR TRIP ON OUR RETURN & TEACHING A MURAL PAINTING CLASS
PLEASE SUPPORT THE ARTS!  We can't get over there without your help !


What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for $5,000 to cover all costs associated with our trip to Bristol from May 25th-May 28th 2013. We are both working artists in (expensive) New York City who have more than one job to pay our rent. Lexi is a mother so she has an extra person to take care of as well! As much as we want to make a living with only by doing art, we arent quite there yet & REALLY NEED YOUR HELP to grow as artists & continue to inspire & continue to spread the benefits of public art internationally. 
Here is the break down of costs:

Air Travel from NYC to Bristol May 25-28:$900-$1500 per person, $3000 for 2
Hotel from May 25-28:$325
Transportation & car rental:$500
Paint & Supplies for 10ft X 10ft mural:$200
Food:$300
Miscellaneous/Emergency fund (injuries, unforseen costs, etc): $625

(if there are left over funds when we return we intend to donate them to the Lower East Side Girl's Club)
Our Gifts To You:
Each of our Perks involve handmade art pieces by us for you!
You receive a piece of art history you helped create by supporting us.
Not only do you get the satisfaction of being a collector (look out Barnes)but we will also send a quality photograph of our finished piece to every one of our contributors!
Finally you also help us to inspire & teach the girls at the Lower East Side Girls Club, who we will be speaking to about our experience when we return as well as teaching about the process!
Sounds like a Win/Win/Win to us!
 
The Impact
       On an artistic level we believe very much in Public Art and perpetuating work that beautifies cities or any surroundings as well as work that is accessable to any viewer. Over the past 30-50 years work within the white cube of a gallery has become more obscure and intimidating to the average person. You can ask anyone what kind of music they like & they will answer you but if you ask them what kind of art they like they may respond, ""I dont know"" or perhaps try to dig into their memory of an art history class they took once. When art is public or in the streets it is accessable for everyone's opinion & more important enjoyment. We want to not only continue the tradition of painting on a large scale & bringing art to the people, as well as develop techniques in the New York tradition of spraypaint. 
     On a pro-woman level being the only female team out of 200 being asked to paint at UpFest carries a lot of weight with us.

<h3>Be a part of something special!</h3>
<p>A very personal tattoo design has been drawn to incorporate participating fans’ names, spanning the whole of our guitarist Chris Holmes’ left leg as a thank you for your endless support, without which we would never have made it this far.  </p>
<p>Chris explains “I've had an overwhelming response from friends, family and fans regarding the enjoyment they receive from being a part of Sansara. Never have I felt so supported by the people that truly matter to me, those that listen to the result of our creativity and passion. I want to give something back and show you all how truly appreciative I am of your love for real, honest and hardworking musicians. </p>
<p>“People say that a tattoo should have deep meaning and I feel that you have all become the very core of my life, so it feels right to have a permanent representation of that with me forever. Some may think I’m insane for doing such a crazy thing, perhaps they’re right, but I wouldn't have it any other way. I’m in this for life and if I wish to ‘donate’ my leg to those who've given me so much, then that’s what’s happening.”</p>
<p>Hundreds of fans will have the opportunity to be included in the permanent tattoo design and nothing like this has ever been attempted before. The first batch of names will be tattooed on 19th June this year (Chris' Birthday), so become a part of the Sansara family forever and make history at the same time!</p>
<p>Remember to share this around - The more the project is seen, the faster the design can come together!</p>

Portuguese furniture into book covers. The idea surged probably inspired by the 
beautiful profession of my husband,  Rúben, who is a restorer of old  furniture and sculptures. To continue doing what we do and love to do, we urgently need to construct a new place to work with wood. We are about to move.                                           The idea of ""books with wooden memory"" was  been born in the tiny country house that we, as lovebirds rented 10 years ago, just after our studies.  Slowly the book making took over the house - from small stable we created carpentry; our bedroom is used for the paper cutting and storage and tiny living room is my office, photo studio and place where I stitch all the books. Now, together with one friend who helps me.  Portuguese Television made nice report from our current workshop this spring.                Together with two children, that came to join us in this adventure, the house became even more tiny and the alarming security conditions of the house (amateur electrical installation, moldy walls all winter, etc.) became unsupportable. We realized that romanticism has its limits and started to look for something more appropriate.  As asking for a loan in Portugal is impossible, especially as freelancers, it  took us two years to find something we can afford to rent and has soul and space that will allow us to work and live in better conditions. Finally we have got it, but the charming house needs some initial restoration - that´s where our savings will go.                       The house we should move into now is beautiful (!), it has a lot of living space for our growing kids and for the bookbinding, but as nothing is perfect, it has no division can be transformed into workshop for our work with wood.Luckily, it has a lot of land around and we are able and anxious to One, that we can dismantle and take with us, if we, eventually, need to go once again.  We need your support now to help us raise funds for such construction.  As our dreams get bigger with the space, we would like to attract more creative people to collaborate on the reclaiming ideas. There are still precious parts of the old furniture that we have no capacity to transform.  For the bookmaking, we are currently collaborating with some friends and Communidade Vida e Paz  but with more space we want to get the place buzzing much more! Working with wood is the livelihood for both of us, so it is completely essential to have the studio done before we can move in. Once we get all the materials, the job can be done in three weeks, so we are confident that by the beginning of July, I am  making books again and Rúben has its place to continue  creating his beautiful boxes, boards and tree swing 
for our shop together with his principal activity - old furniture and 
sculpture restoration. At this time, our dream of collaborative working platform will have a base to come true.                                     The studio will be big enough to store all the precious furniture fragments I collect for years, to fit  all the carpentry machines and tools for wood working. We will create good space  for all the wood cutting, cleaning and sanding and especially a place for all the hand carving of  the personalized covers. It will have two divisions,  one for the ""clean"" work (waxing, polishing, hand carving, eventually painting)  and part for the ""dirty"" work like wood cutting, planing, sanding etc..We will be finally able to work on bigger pieces..Here is the place for our future workshop. The house with its garden  has been abandoned for 9 years,  but with some work  it all gets in place. The workshop we want to build  will be bigger than our current place and  will finally allow me and Rúben, together with partners we want invite to collaborate, to share one working space in some comfort.  What is also important, the conditions  allow us to have proper electricity in workshop and house.The estimation cost only for the  materials is 6500 €. If we get less then this amount, the construction will need to be smaller, but some place to work simply has to be built.                                            First of all, I want to make sure 
this isn't just a charity effort, but an opportunity to make some personalized gifts for the amazing people who have 
supported our work over the years! As you know, there are no two equal pieces  in our production and we have no stock of the gifts we are about to offer for the contributions, so here comes just overall idea  of what you will get. The types of wood reclaimed from old  furniture vary a lot, so you may receive piece from wood of different color or grain. What is guaranteed is that it is made from a material with long, long memory.      Examples of name boardExample of TWO names boardExamples of personalized diary                    Examples of personalized albumsThe bookmaking workshops and bookmaking residence scheduling will be discussed individually.",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>ONCE UPON A TIME…..</b></p>
<p><b>I clicked ‘SEND” in the dreamy hope, I’d make it to this beautiful
point.</b></p>
<p>It was a ‘way too early morning’ internet
search that tumbled me into and landed me on Arquetopia’s page. During an
overload of paper working tasks, for my recent role as an arts project manager…
I would often take breaks for my mind, fleeting off into the net, seeking to
find dream possibilities that would merge my passions. On that particular
3am-ish, it absolutely occurred. </p>
<p>Did I find it… or did it find me? A center for:
creative, cultural and community innovation with a focus on collaboration and
positive social action… formed by an industrious, talented and passionate team
of individuals…. Who were offering Artist Residencies... For the ‘Day of the
Dead/Dia De Muertos’…. In Mexico.<span>  I may
have fallen off the chair… I was definitely doing so in my mind, utterly
gobsmacked.</span></p>
<p>Waves of tingling goodness rose within my
entire self. Could this be possible for me? Should I apply? Are those even questions?
</p>
<p>My interest in Mexican culture, and that of
the Latin Americas, may be considered an obsession. If stalking a culture was
possible, I’d be jailed. </p>
<p>Initially, through fault of a gorgeous uni
tutor I was taught by (Miss Sonya Peters), I was introduced to and spiked by an
immediate love and admiration for the works of Mexican Artists &amp; Activists:
Frida Kahlo and then, her partner Diego Rivera.</p>
<p>Their
bravery in the raw revelation of their most distinct human experience,
captivated me. It also led me into a deep line of research regarding the bold
vibrancy of life this country beholds, regardless of seriously challenging
stories. It is like the more the push against the people, the greater the
explosion of creative expression, the more fervent the individual strives to
assert themselves through positive practice. I am enamored. </p>
<p>Applying was a must of my heart strings, and
as you know from the intro… I clicked ‘SEND’…. And here we now are. <br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.arquetopia.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.arquetopia.org/</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.elysiumgreene.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.elysiumgreene.com/</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/handmadechanger"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/handmadechanger</a></p><p><b>WHO THE HECK AM I?</b>
</p><p>I am Elysium Greene, and although there are
quite a few titles that represent my life undertakings, after being a soul
parent to another gorgeous human… I find dubbing myself a Social Arts Activist to
be the most fitting. </p>
<p>What this means for me is that my arts
practice has basis in two important places: That initiatives and outcomes are
aligned with theories of ‘triple bottom line living’ and that they offer those
engaged, an opportunity to further recognize the power of their unique and
limitless potential. </p>
<p>For those not yet introduced, Triple Bottom
Line Living is basically a form of personal and decided accountability in life,
not about perfection but presence. To act with awareness toward and
responsibility for: economic, social and environmental impacts and outcomes. By
doing so we inevitably honour the self, others and our shared spaces. </p>
<p>Stemming from this, in recognizing each
person’s unique and limitless potential, we come to a truth that I feel is
undeniable in and of life. This being that: there is, was, and will only ever
be one of you. Regardless of similarity, no other being can produce any outcome
that you will produce in your particular way. For me I feel there is an
abolishment of rivalry here, making it possible to honour the individual wholly,
whilst also causing greater space for effective and empowered collaboration. We
can in duality appreciate fully the self and other for the positive. </p>
<p>Although Aesthetic outcomes are important to
me (being the sensory beauty of a ‘thing’) Triple bottom line and self/other
honouring, comes first in all that I be and do. I work with a multitude of
mediums, considering first the above and then moving into what would fit most
conceptually with the narrative I am looking to convey. Sometimes this may be
performance orientated, painting, sculpture, music, etc. from my individual
self, and at other times it may the creation of initiatives that support the expressive
practices of others, as well as providing educative opportunities in the arts
for varied demographics. Essentially, I consider all to be vital formations of
my practice, which I am truly grateful for. </p>
<p>But rocking onward to the particular business
of the awesome opportunity that has been offered to me (and now you)…. </p>
<p><b>WHY IS THIS ARQUETOPIAN RESIDENCY PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT?</b></p>
<p>Engaging directly with artisans and the Puebla
community for Dias De Muertos, means I will be 100% immersed and engaged with a
cultural practice that celebrates through resourceful creation and community
connection that which is often feared within a large percentage of western
cultures, especially my own. </p>
<p>In speaking of this, I am referring to the
unavoidable aspect of life, being our mortality. From my subjective experience,
I have grown up and into a world faced often with the passing away of those I
have loved deeply. As a child I had come to understand this as a mournful and
quite dark occurrence, one which was best put aside in life and forgotten as
soon as possible in an effort to ‘move on’. </p>
<p>What I have encountered from a far in
researching the practices of Dias De Muertos, is a celebration that is
embracing of our mortality, enacted annually in honour and mindfulness towards
those loved ones as they have left this world. This is not to say that grief
and pain are absent here, but that they have the opportunity to be transmuted,
through creativity, celebration and connection into positive experience. </p>
<p><b>WHERE DOES THIS DIRECT RESEARCH LEAD?</b></p>
<p>It is the way in which these practices allow
for the very natural physiological processes of emotion and feeling to be
experienced and expressed, that I am most interested in and where the focus of
my residency will be based. </p>
<p>For the past year I have been working on,
well… several creative outcomes actually, but in regards to this amazing
project, what has filled my heart and mind often are the written stories I have
created that address simple and fundamental aspects of life toward the greatest
possibility for wellbeing. </p>
<p>In research practice I worked with a gorgeous
health practitioner (Tania Veronese) during this period to address directly the
‘thought-belief-feeling- action’ cycle of physiology. This practice of
conscious self-observance and decided alteration is a form of direct
neurological or brain retraining that enables the individual to slowly
recondition patterns which do not serve in the fulfillment of a beautiful life
(which we are all absolutely deserving of, of course!) </p>
<p>During this time, I also undertook a practice
to address the important physical aspects of my lived experience. I did so (and
continue) under the teaching of a brilliant Canadian yoga instructor Kelly Korpesio,
who served to break down misconceptions regarding my body’s own potential,
whilst also dispelling fear and developing instead an understanding of presence
and awareness for physiological sensation. </p>
<p>These commitments in combination with past
investigations, led me to realize how important such knowledge is for the self.
It is the simplified understanding of how we are able to empower ourselves
through our choices, by observing, rather than fully attaching to our feeling and
physical sensations that I find a most valuable as a change agent. </p>
<p>Although I understand the benefits of activism
on a global scale – I do see the biggest agent for change globally as being:
self-responsibility, self-awareness and self-love. Without being idealistic, if
we are each moved toward this first, a whole lot of positive ripples would
occur that could dispel an awful lot of not-so-great happenings that occur on
our planet. </p>
<p><b>WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME?</b></p>
<p>With intention, I imagine a beautiful and
vibrant narrative, scientifically and culturally based with a large dose of
soulful whimsy. An illustrative publication expressing a possible directive
toward how we might meet our rising emotions and feelings with agency,
dispelling fear and creating more space for stillness and balance within
ourselves. With visuals and text created for both our children and inner
children, this authorship would serve to offer assistance in understanding a
very natural process of our humanness and how we may harness it. </p>
<p>In Merging with the practices of local
artisans, joining with the community of Puebla, in collaboration with other
residing international artists and the directors and staff of Arquetopia,
brings me to the opportunity of producing this with a multitude of positive
outcomes. </p>
<p>In Puebla, I will be connecting to my direct
environment, drawing inspiration from all that which is present to me. Like a
happy sponge I will open to absorbing every possible goodness available. In
doing so the absolute outcome for the visual aspects of the publication are not
set in stone. It may be that through my residency I am taken with a practice
that moves more toward the development of a sculptural narrative documented
through photography or hand drawn illustrations using traditional Pueblan
techniques, the potentials here are quite limitless. </p>
<p>What will occur for certain: </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The creation of a hard copy &amp; EBook children’s publication with
content as specified above, delivered as one in English &amp; <span>Española </span>that will be available to
the public. </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>This publication will contain the name and location of each individual
that has contributed in any sense to the ‘Handmade Change : Cambio Hecho a
Mano’ project magnifying the importance and prevalence of collaboration.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>The authorship sales will also maintain a 30% donation from profit toward
the ongoing positive practices of Arquetopia Mexico, which aside from the
economic positives – will also contribute to supporting the beautiful bridge of
cultural connection and exchange between Mexico and Australia.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>WHAT OTHER NIFTY UNDERTAKINGS ARE YOU ACTIVATING FOR THIS PROJECT OF
GOODNESS?</b></p>
<p>Nothing escapes this beautiful path without the
side sprouting goodness of something a lil bit special… and to align with that,
I will be undertaking a 3<sup>rd</sup> LIVE ‘Inner Lurve Bird’ conceptual self
painting performance at a secret Gold Coast location which will be revealed on
the official project pages in a weeks time!</p>
<p>This performance is set to nab the communities
lovely attention toward the HAND MADE CHANGE : Cambio Hecho a Mano Residency
Project, as well as provide information regarding ARQUETOPIA Southern Mexico.
Most importantly though, it is performed with the direct intention of
reflecting our individual limitless potential toward our self-experience and
expression!</p>
<p>You can view film documentation of past
performances through the links below and too, keep a check on the project pages
for the performance release date and location!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>LET’S GET
OUR COLLABORATIVE PERKINESS ON!!</b></p>
<p>I love the
idea that, through asking for your awesome contribution &amp; support with this
project, the residencies essence of collaboration begins way before my arrival.
</p>
<p>Acknowledging
every ‘heart-connected-hand’ that makes any positive outcome possible on this
earth, is of absolute importance to me. In this way there is no 'thing' that is
devoid of collaboration, even when individual efforts are magnified. We
experience a world filled with creative joint efforts, everything we: see,
utilize &amp; engage with is the formation of many hands working together for
innovative results. </p>
<p>It is kooky
but, I often find myself considering such things when the garbage is collected.
My perception and cognition is used to the fact that this will occur for me in
my particular location, but imagine life without this industrious chain of
workers &amp; subsequent events? Every single human that causes that very
important public service to occur, so that I (and we) may live within sanitary
and beautiful conditions. It is humbling and inspiring that folk would dedicate
their 'one time lives' to such practices. So much collaborative creativity in
positive action right there! </p>
<p>And so here
it is too, although my passion does not seek to provide the vital service that
cleanses and beautifies our shared spaces in that particular way.... I am
seeking to create an outcome through unity, creativity and mindfulness, which
will offer positive expansion for our inwardly experienced worlds, to then
further our individual &amp; collective wellbeing.</p>
<p>When you
contribute to this project, you are right there with me, another amazing hand
creating positive change toward a common goal. We move together, regardless of
geographic location, or particular investment, and whatever the outcome maybe,
it is formed through 'us', by 'us' and for 'us'. </p>
<p><b>SO... WHAT IS FINANCIALLY NEEDED TO GET THIS ALL A
HAPPENIN’?</b></p>
<p>There are
several costs involved in undertaking residency with Arquetopia. The
organization has been effecting positive change with creative collaboration
through residencies since 1996. I find this to be an epic task to succeed with
in light of Mexico's economic climate. There is no beating around the bush
here, in Australia we are blessed with a different economic experience. One of
the first positive ripples of this residency is the effect of being able to
contribute economically to the organization itself and thus Mexico, via my
placement. </p>
<p>The 8 week
period of residency in Puebla that has been offered to me totals: $4537.37
Australian dollars. This is my primary goal and focus for the raising of funds
through this campaign and covers:</p>
<p><b>A. Accommodation and Meals for the period</b></p>
<p><b>B. Use of the open artist studios</b></p>
<p><b>C. Connection with local artisans or any folk I
should need to collaborate with to enable my intended project</b></p>
<p><b>D. Full support and assistance in any other way
that is possible from the beautiful Arquetopia staff to enable successful
residency outcomes. </b></p>
<p>I would be
completely grateful, touched, humbled, inspired (and all emotions such as this)
if we could reach this one goal. </p>
<p>In saying
that and believing in all things limitlessly growing in an awesome fashion, if
we can reach beyond it, this is how the budget will be utilized: </p>
<p><b>$4537.37 = Residency Cost Covered!</b></p>
<p><b>$6000 = the above + Return flights from London to
Mexico City! (Est. $1700)</b></p>
<p><b>*I am departing for Mexico from London as I will be
taking my beautiful 10 year old daughter Esona to stay with her father &amp;
his family in the UK first from Australia.</b></p>
<p><b>$7000 = the above + Insurance Protection for my
travel period! </b></p>
<p><b>$8000 = the above + Consumables &amp; Incidental
costs covered for the period!</b></p>
<p><b>$9000 = the above + Arrival &amp; Departure
accommodation costs pre &amp; post residency, as well as connecting travel
needs &amp; residency art materials for period.</b></p>
<p><b>$11,000 = A $2000 start-up fund to secure first
edition print of the residency outcome for the illustrated publication. </b></p>
<p><b>$11,000 &amp; BEYOND = the possibility of extended
development, collaboration and residency with Arquetopia in the publication

<br/></div>","ONCE UPON A TIME…..
I clicked ‘SEND” in the dreamy hope, I’d make it to this beautiful
point.
It was a ‘way too early morning’ internet
search that tumbled me into and landed me on Arquetopia’s page. During an
overload of paper working tasks, for my recent role as an arts project manager…
I would often take breaks for my mind, fleeting off into the net, seeking to
find dream possibilities that would merge my passions. On that particular
3am-ish, it absolutely occurred. 
Did I find it… or did it find me? A center for:
creative, cultural and community innovation with a focus on collaboration and
positive social action… formed by an industrious, talented and passionate team
of individuals…. Who were offering Artist Residencies... For the ‘Day of the
Dead/Dia De Muertos’…. In Mexico.  I may
have fallen off the chair… I was definitely doing so in my mind, utterly
gobsmacked.
Waves of tingling goodness rose within my
entire self. Could this be possible for me? Should I apply? Are those even questions?

My interest in Mexican culture, and that of
the Latin Americas, may be considered an obsession. If stalking a culture was
possible, I’d be jailed. 
Initially, through fault of a gorgeous uni
tutor I was taught by (Miss Sonya Peters), I was introduced to and spiked by an
immediate love and admiration for the works of Mexican Artists & Activists:
Frida Kahlo and then, her partner Diego Rivera.
Their
bravery in the raw revelation of their most distinct human experience,
captivated me. It also led me into a deep line of research regarding the bold
vibrancy of life this country beholds, regardless of seriously challenging
stories. It is like the more the push against the people, the greater the
explosion of creative expression, the more fervent the individual strives to
assert themselves through positive practice. I am enamored. 
Applying was a must of my heart strings, and
as you know from the intro… I clicked ‘SEND’…. And here we now are. http://www.arquetopia.org/http://www.elysiumgreene.com/https://www.facebook.com/handmadechangerWHO THE HECK AM I?
I am Elysium Greene, and although there are
quite a few titles that represent my life undertakings, after being a soul
parent to another gorgeous human… I find dubbing myself a Social Arts Activist to
be the most fitting. 
What this means for me is that my arts
practice has basis in two important places: That initiatives and outcomes are
aligned with theories of ‘triple bottom line living’ and that they offer those
engaged, an opportunity to further recognize the power of their unique and
limitless potential. 
For those not yet introduced, Triple Bottom
Line Living is basically a form of personal and decided accountability in life,
not about perfection but presence. To act with awareness toward and
responsibility for: economic, social and environmental impacts and outcomes. By
doing so we inevitably honour the self, others and our shared spaces. 
Stemming from this, in recognizing each
person’s unique and limitless potential, we come to a truth that I feel is
undeniable in and of life. This being that: there is, was, and will only ever
be one of you. Regardless of similarity, no other being can produce any outcome
that you will produce in your particular way. For me I feel there is an
abolishment of rivalry here, making it possible to honour the individual wholly,
whilst also causing greater space for effective and empowered collaboration. We
can in duality appreciate fully the self and other for the positive. 
Although Aesthetic outcomes are important to
me (being the sensory beauty of a ‘thing’) Triple bottom line and self/other
honouring, comes first in all that I be and do. I work with a multitude of
mediums, considering first the above and then moving into what would fit most
conceptually with the narrative I am looking to convey. Sometimes this may be
performance orientated, painting, sculpture, music, etc. from my individual
self, and at other times it may the creation of initiatives that support the expressive
practices of others, as well as providing educative opportunities in the arts
for varied demographics. Essentially, I consider all to be vital formations of
my practice, which I am truly grateful for. 
But rocking onward to the particular business
of the awesome opportunity that has been offered to me (and now you)…. 
WHY IS THIS ARQUETOPIAN RESIDENCY PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT?
Engaging directly with artisans and the Puebla
community for Dias De Muertos, means I will be 100% immersed and engaged with a
cultural practice that celebrates through resourceful creation and community
connection that which is often feared within a large percentage of western
cultures, especially my own. 
In speaking of this, I am referring to the
unavoidable aspect of life, being our mortality. From my subjective experience,
I have grown up and into a world faced often with the passing away of those I
have loved deeply. As a child I had come to understand this as a mournful and
quite dark occurrence, one which was best put aside in life and forgotten as
soon as possible in an effort to ‘move on’. 
What I have encountered from a far in
researching the practices of Dias De Muertos, is a celebration that is
embracing of our mortality, enacted annually in honour and mindfulness towards
those loved ones as they have left this world. This is not to say that grief
and pain are absent here, but that they have the opportunity to be transmuted,
through creativity, celebration and connection into positive experience. 
WHERE DOES THIS DIRECT RESEARCH LEAD?
It is the way in which these practices allow
for the very natural physiological processes of emotion and feeling to be
experienced and expressed, that I am most interested in and where the focus of
my residency will be based. 
For the past year I have been working on,
well… several creative outcomes actually, but in regards to this amazing
project, what has filled my heart and mind often are the written stories I have
created that address simple and fundamental aspects of life toward the greatest
possibility for wellbeing. 
In research practice I worked with a gorgeous
health practitioner (Tania Veronese) during this period to address directly the
‘thought-belief-feeling- action’ cycle of physiology. This practice of
conscious self-observance and decided alteration is a form of direct
neurological or brain retraining that enables the individual to slowly
recondition patterns which do not serve in the fulfillment of a beautiful life
(which we are all absolutely deserving of, of course!) 
During this time, I also undertook a practice
to address the important physical aspects of my lived experience. I did so (and
continue) under the teaching of a brilliant Canadian yoga instructor Kelly Korpesio,
who served to break down misconceptions regarding my body’s own potential,
whilst also dispelling fear and developing instead an understanding of presence
and awareness for physiological sensation. 
These commitments in combination with past
investigations, led me to realize how important such knowledge is for the self.
It is the simplified understanding of how we are able to empower ourselves
through our choices, by observing, rather than fully attaching to our feeling and
physical sensations that I find a most valuable as a change agent. 
Although I understand the benefits of activism
on a global scale – I do see the biggest agent for change globally as being:
self-responsibility, self-awareness and self-love. Without being idealistic, if
we are each moved toward this first, a whole lot of positive ripples would
occur that could dispel an awful lot of not-so-great happenings that occur on
our planet. 
WHAT WILL BE THE OUTCOME?
With intention, I imagine a beautiful and
vibrant narrative, scientifically and culturally based with a large dose of
soulful whimsy. An illustrative publication expressing a possible directive
toward how we might meet our rising emotions and feelings with agency,
dispelling fear and creating more space for stillness and balance within
ourselves. With visuals and text created for both our children and inner
children, this authorship would serve to offer assistance in understanding a
very natural process of our humanness and how we may harness it. 
In Merging with the practices of local
artisans, joining with the community of Puebla, in collaboration with other
residing international artists and the directors and staff of Arquetopia,
brings me to the opportunity of producing this with a multitude of positive
outcomes. 
In Puebla, I will be connecting to my direct
environment, drawing inspiration from all that which is present to me. Like a
happy sponge I will open to absorbing every possible goodness available. In
doing so the absolute outcome for the visual aspects of the publication are not
set in stone. It may be that through my residency I am taken with a practice
that moves more toward the development of a sculptural narrative documented
through photography or hand drawn illustrations using traditional Pueblan
techniques, the potentials here are quite limitless. 
What will occur for certain: 
· 
The creation of a hard copy & EBook children’s publication with
content as specified above, delivered as one in English & Española that will be available to
the public. 
· 
This publication will contain the name and location of each individual
that has contributed in any sense to the ‘Handmade Change : Cambio Hecho a
Mano’ project magnifying the importance and prevalence of collaboration.
· 
The authorship sales will also maintain a 30% donation from profit toward
the ongoing positive practices of Arquetopia Mexico, which aside from the
economic positives – will also contribute to supporting the beautiful bridge of
cultural connection and exchange between Mexico and Australia.

WHAT OTHER NIFTY UNDERTAKINGS ARE YOU ACTIVATING FOR THIS PROJECT OF
GOODNESS?
Nothing escapes this beautiful path without the
side sprouting goodness of something a lil bit special… and to align with that,
I will be undertaking a 3rd LIVE ‘Inner Lurve Bird’ conceptual self
painting performance at a secret Gold Coast location which will be revealed on
the official project pages in a weeks time!
This performance is set to nab the communities
lovely attention toward the HAND MADE CHANGE : Cambio Hecho a Mano Residency
Project, as well as provide information regarding ARQUETOPIA Southern Mexico.
Most importantly though, it is performed with the direct intention of
reflecting our individual limitless potential toward our self-experience and
expression!
You can view film documentation of past
performances through the links below and too, keep a check on the project pages
for the performance release date and location!

LET’S GET
OUR COLLABORATIVE PERKINESS ON!!
I love the
idea that, through asking for your awesome contribution & support with this
project, the residencies essence of collaboration begins way before my arrival.

Acknowledging
every ‘heart-connected-hand’ that makes any positive outcome possible on this
earth, is of absolute importance to me. In this way there is no 'thing' that is
devoid of collaboration, even when individual efforts are magnified. We
experience a world filled with creative joint efforts, everything we: see,
utilize & engage with is the formation of many hands working together for
innovative results. 
It is kooky
but, I often find myself considering such things when the garbage is collected.
My perception and cognition is used to the fact that this will occur for me in
my particular location, but imagine life without this industrious chain of
workers & subsequent events? Every single human that causes that very
important public service to occur, so that I (and we) may live within sanitary
and beautiful conditions. It is humbling and inspiring that folk would dedicate
their 'one time lives' to such practices. So much collaborative creativity in
positive action right there! 
And so here
it is too, although my passion does not seek to provide the vital service that
cleanses and beautifies our shared spaces in that particular way.... I am
seeking to create an outcome through unity, creativity and mindfulness, which
will offer positive expansion for our inwardly experienced worlds, to then
further our individual & collective wellbeing.
When you
contribute to this project, you are right there with me, another amazing hand
creating positive change toward a common goal. We move together, regardless of
geographic location, or particular investment, and whatever the outcome maybe,
it is formed through 'us', by 'us' and for 'us'. 
SO... WHAT IS FINANCIALLY NEEDED TO GET THIS ALL A
HAPPENIN’?
There are
several costs involved in undertaking residency with Arquetopia. The
organization has been effecting positive change with creative collaboration
through residencies since 1996. I find this to be an epic task to succeed with
in light of Mexico's economic climate. There is no beating around the bush
here, in Australia we are blessed with a different economic experience. One of
the first positive ripples of this residency is the effect of being able to
contribute economically to the organization itself and thus Mexico, via my
placement. 
The 8 week
period of residency in Puebla that has been offered to me totals: $4537.37
Australian dollars. This is my primary goal and focus for the raising of funds
through this campaign and covers:
A. Accommodation and Meals for the period
B. Use of the open artist studios
C. Connection with local artisans or any folk I
should need to collaborate with to enable my intended project
D. Full support and assistance in any other way
that is possible from the beautiful Arquetopia staff to enable successful
residency outcomes. 
I would be
completely grateful, touched, humbled, inspired (and all emotions such as this)
if we could reach this one goal. 
In saying
that and believing in all things limitlessly growing in an awesome fashion, if
we can reach beyond it, this is how the budget will be utilized: 
$4537.37 = Residency Cost Covered!
$6000 = the above + Return flights from London to
Mexico City! (Est. $1700)
*I am departing for Mexico from London as I will be
taking my beautiful 10 year old daughter Esona to stay with her father &
his family in the UK first from Australia.
$7000 = the above + Insurance Protection for my
travel period! 
$8000 = the above + Consumables & Incidental
costs covered for the period!
$9000 = the above + Arrival & Departure
accommodation costs pre & post residency, as well as connecting travel
needs & residency art materials for period.
$11,000 = A $2000 start-up fund to secure first
edition print of the residency outcome for the illustrated publication. 
$11,000 & BEYOND = the possibility of extended
development, collaboration and residency with Arquetopia in the publication
period to enable maximum impact and positive possibilities for project reach.
As you can
see, what is needed beyond the goal I have put forward is quite extensive. For
this reason I have chosen the flexible platform option. This means, with
Indiegogo, if we don’t make it quite to target, it is ok! The funds will still
be put toward the project and help immensely – if we should go above &
beyond – it is of course, also totally amazing!
I WOULD LIKE TO PERK YOU!
When I
considered putting forward this campaign, a very shy aspect of myself piped up
to question the ‘should-ness’ of it all. The vulnerabilities emergent from
putting ourselves fully out there and asking for support can exist for us all.
In these cases, I always feel it’s probably best to tell my mind to take a
break and embrace the situation heart first. Also, the essence that this could
be the first point of collaboration for the project, enabling my own community
and those far reaching to become contributors, far outweighs any rising fears. 
And so if
all of the above lights up your ‘everything’ as it does mine… and you’re taking
this beautiful ride with me, I have so much appreciation for your support! I
also have some sweet… sweeeeet… perky-perks to gift back your way! 
Every
collaborator regardless of support type, will be listed in the final
publication, besides which there are: artworks, eBooks, hardcopy publications and the like to choose from
in exchange!
If you find
yourself in the position of not currently being able to give financially, but
have time to be a Handmade Change Sharer…. Please let me know – because this is
also completely awesome and highly valuable! 
In all other cases, Please see below for the perky-perk
gifts on offer for your beautiful support, and thank you so very much for your

I’m Jez Dolan, an artist based in
Manchester UK. I work with printmaking, installation and performance, and much of my practice as an artist utilises LGBT heritage and archives from
which to create new artwork.
My current project is an exploration of George Cecil Ives, who in the late 1890's in London founded The Order of Chaeronea, the modern world's first secret homosexual society. Members of the order included Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred 'Bosie' Douglas. Ives and The Order are a little known or explored, but a crucial part of a shared LGBT heritage.
I’m interested in exploring our
shared LGBT heritage and history, and presenting it in the context of
contemporary art. This shared heritage is something which often goes unnoticed and uncredited. 
The resulting exhibition will be presented at Artwork Atelier, Salford in January 2015, and will comprise of installation, sound and printmaking (exact dates tbc).

   The Project
The project, and my practice is highly rooted in research. George Ives' papers (he kept a daily diary for 63 years) and the ephemera of The Order are held in the archives of The Harry Ransom Centre, University of Texas at Austin, and I will be undertaking a research visit to the archive in October. Ives' papers in the archive are rarely accessed, and are not available outside of the archive.
I am currently in discussion with a number of curators and gallerists to develop the exhibition further.

I received £10,000 from Arts Council England to enable this project to happen. The total cost of the project is £13,000.

Add to that sewing, writing, dog training and poop scooping!</p>
<p>However, one subject matter that always captivated me was the egg.  Eggs were magical to me when I was a child and they hold my fascination to this day.  Over the years, as I pursued my serious life, I continually sketched eggs, made soft fabric eggs, explored eggs in history, mythology, cooking and art.  I created brass egg containers and quilted the insides to be fertilized.  My egg art was a poorly guarded secret.  I even created a 14K gold test tube baby, using the lost wax process. This was my artistic interpretation of a fertilized egg in a test tube.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I changed the direction of my life to take a chance and pursue my art seriously.  I have experienced success as a pastel artist, but one day as I was playing around with a new medium, wet felting, the idea of egg containers came to me.  And I started creating and designing what I now call my Feltagge Fleggs, wet felted eggs with legs. These containers are both a work of art and a place to hold your goals, dreams and even secrets.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t stop there.  My paintings and pastels began to take a new direction, and I am now looking at the egg as the idea subject matter to nurture my growth as an artist. </p>
<p>My show is not the completion of two years worth of work, but rather a milestone in my journey.  This show is the not the end of my exploration with eggs as my focus; it is my commitment to continuing what I hope will be a lifelong passion fulfilled.  I am working with several mediums that I have always loved, and adding new ones as I learn.  </p>
<p>My fundraising campaign is important as the best vehicle to bring my innovative egg creations to the art-appreciating public. I will be documenting the process to share in a series of workshops I will be presenting throughout the year. A gallery is hosting this show in June and the funds will be used to help make this possible.</p>
<p>My Egg Project will be in the feature artist section of the gallery. My eggs would never have been created if not for being around a collaborative group of artists. After working alone for so many years, the sharing the experience with others and inviting input took me in unexpected and exciting directions!  Part of this exhibit includes an “egg hunt” in the gallery, inviting other artists to create a piece of work where viewers will search for and report their findings.  These search ballots will be recorded and at the end of the exhibit I will hold a drawing with one of my Feltagee Fleggs© as the grand prize.</p>
<p>Eggs symbolize for me the hatching and incubating process.  And my “nest” hosts so many others who unknowingly or not, have contributed, mentored, encouraged and delighted me along the way. This show is my thank you them, but also an invitation to others to join me in the process.  Contributing financially is one way for now, but my goal is to continue to create and encourage collaborations after the exhibit.  I love the idea of helping others to hatch their ideas, to respect their incubation periods and to grow some feathers and fly.  My show at its most basic level is to exhibit my work, but at its dream level it is to help others see where they can reach to in their own creativity.  I strive to be part of the process that encourages others.</p>
<p>The contributions will allow professional filming of the show to be presented to public libraries, area schools and senior centers as a way of engaging the community's awareness of creativity being available to all. The film will include the Quarterly 30-Day Creativity Challenges I offer at the Art MoB gallery in Hendersonville, North Carolina.  Additional funds will be used for the following:</p>
<p>Framing supplies for nice paintings and pastel drawings items ($700)</p>
<p>Printing materials for marketing use, for cards and prints for sale ($500)</p>

Chin and I make paper flower wreaths, prints, and drawings out of my studio in Lawrence, Kansas. A little over two years ago, I fell in love with a guy from Germany. We’ve spent about a year and half 5,000 miles apart — for those keeping track, that is more distance than both the Proclaimers and Vanessa Carlton combined are willing to walk for love. It’s a real bummer being so far apart, and we’re ready to close the distance.However, it’s important to me that my ambitions in love don’t interfere with the career I’ve worked hard to build. My plan is to open a similar version of my shop operation in Germany after obtaining a freelance visa. The visa application is a pretty convoluted process that requires not only a lot of paperwork and bureaucratic gymnastics, but also a sizable chunk of money.Oof.Here’s where you come in - we can help each other out! Maybe you’ve wanted to own a piece of my work for a while, or perhaps one of your loved ones has expressed a desire to have a Grace D.

Each deck comes with a folded cheat-sheet with glimpses at the meanings of the cards. ​what's this all about?This in an invitation for you to receive a vintage-inspired tarot deck with a modern sci-fi twist. This deck explores themes present in contemporary tarot art such as sci-fi and fantasy, and does it while also keeping both feet firmly on the ground.If you're a seasoned tarot reader, this is an opportunity to get a fresh viewpoint, and if you're a complete beginner, I've got you covered with a basic cheat-sheet of meanings included with each deck. what you'll receiveThe most important benefit offered as a perk within this campaign is the deck itself. It's a 78 card tarot deck printed in full color on 330 g/m2 paper, with rounded corners and no borders. This includes a double sided cheat-sheet with a nudge to the meanings of the cards.Another option adds a handmade pouch to the tarot deck perk. The pouch is made up of two fabrics, and one of those has been designed and printed to accompany the card designs. The lining is made from another fabric - a randomly selected re-purposed one.The third option adds a handmade altar / reading cloth to the tarot deck. There are 6 different design variations and the one you receive will be selected at random.   If you pledge under the price of the deck and choose the Digital Artwork perk, you will receive a full color digital image of the Lovers card which you can print in good quality up to 12 x 17 cm size (4.7 x 6.7 in). If you want a specific other card from the Major Arcana please contact me and leave your email and the name of the card that you want to receive and I will be in touch. what I'm asking for & what's to be doneStarting goal: $15'000 to bring this project to life. The money will be used towards printing a first run of the Vibra Tarot deck and shipping it out. This is a starting goal, as I'll be over the moon if this is surpassed and we can print more decks and include stretch goals - yay!Stretch goal #1: $20'000 in project funds is reached:  the SOLO ALTAR CLOTH perk is unlocked and you can now add a matching altar cloth to your benefits.Stretch goal #2: $25'000 in project funds is reached: the GILDED EDGES option is unlocked and ALL decks now come with silver gilding of the edges.What's still to be done in regards to me designing this project is that I've got to design a fabric design for the pouches. risks & challengesThe card designs are finished and ready to print. The only real risk is the risk of missing out on this deck.There's a great support system of fairy godmothers and godfathers (family and friends) who help with developing the deck whenever input from others is needed. There are around 33 people that have contributed greatly to this project already! MY GRATITUDE TO YOU!If I don't reach the entire starting goal, I plan to use the money to print the number of decks that have been pledged for and ship them to the contributors. other ways You can helpLove the deck but don't have the cash?Share this project on your social media or let your tarot friends know specifically.Leave a comment with some of your love.The Digital Artwork perk is just $10 so if you want a new background for your phone or a small DIY print, you can give that a go!

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<h3><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Thank you so much for your interest in our new shop! It feels like the culmination of many spent working together as a couple &amp; creative team, and we can't wait to share it with you! It all still feels pretty surreal, to be honest :)</span></h3>
<p>We (Ashley &amp; Justin) met in art school &amp; have been together since 2004, through all kinds of personal, artistic, and financial ups &amp; downs. For years, we took turns working  random jobs, giving each other alternating time to move our creative goals forward. Over the years I've sold thousands of small drawings, and Ashley built a handmade business that eventually became a full-time job for both of us. Secret Holiday has been our sole livelihood for five years, and we're thankful every day to be able to work, and laugh, and solve problems together.</p>
<p>We've been dreaming about opening a storefront in Northampton for a long time. When we first moved here in 2007, it was already taking shape - - ""someday we're going to do this &amp; it's going to be amazing!"" But in reality it started a long time before that. 13 year old Ashley had already decided she wanted to go to art school &amp; own a shop when she grew up - - and for me, mid-90s Northampton was the coolest place I'd ever been. I spent a lot of time here - - seeing bands, buying cds &amp; ill-fitting vintage corduroys, and imagining what kind of shop I might open someday in a place like this...  </p>
<p>Well, here we are! By some crazy combination of luck and determination we're in our thirties and nearing the grand opening of our awesome little shop, Grapefruit! And it's happening in this magical, strange little city that is special to both of us in so many ways. We feel so strongly that we belong here, and that we've created something that people are really going to relate to. We've curated a super weird, beautiful, challenging collection of work to share with you - - All kinds of handmade goods, original art, jewelry, self care, books &amp; zines, pop culture artifacts, fancy chocolate... We think it's a really unique mix of art &amp; culture &amp; social consciousness &amp; beauty &amp; coziness, and it is VERY true to who we are. We sincerely hope that it adds something fun &amp; worthwhile to Western Mass :)</p>
<p>Another really great thing is that our studio will be in the back half of the space, so there will be lots of creative energy right here in the shop &amp; potential for all kinds of workshops &amp; events.</p>
<p>We've got about a month left to make it all come together, and there's an overwhelming (but exciting) amount of stuff to get done. The content is all set - - we've got work from several dozen artists &amp; makers (including our own) in house &amp; ready to go... but everything else is in some state of being unfinished or not yet begun :)</p>
<p>We've got to:</p>
<p>- build a dividing wall</p>
<p>- build &amp; buy displays</p>
<p>- paint exterior &amp; some of interior</p>
<p>- install a window</p>
<p>- design &amp; produce signage</p>
<p>- purchase an iPad/cash register</p>
<p>- finish paying for wholesale orders</p>
<p>- purchase all the little essentials: bags, boxes, labels, wrappings papers, office supplies, plants, &amp; a zillion other little things too boring or weird to list</p>
<p>- probably ten other things we haven't thought of yet!</p>
<p>The largest challenge of getting all this accomplished is that we have to take a LOT of time away from Secret Holiday, which is how we actually pay for everything in our lives. There's no loans, no secret benefactor... just us! So there's very little money coming in while we're working to open Grapefruit. If this project we're undertaking interests or excites you at all, please consider helping us fund everything we've got to get done! We would be eternally grateful, and you could simultaneously be purchasing some awesome stuff! </p>
<p>Here's what's available:</p>
<p>For $10, you get a Grapefruit button &amp; a thank you note</p>
<p>For $20, you get a cool Grapefruit tote bag + button </p>
<p>For $40, you get a $50 gift certificate to Grapefruit (A nice discount - - 20%! And it never expires!) PLUS the Grapefruit tote bag + button </p>

It was incredible fun! I’ve been concocting this particular project, Mega Mega, for YEARS and it’s going to make quite an impression (if you donate $25 or more, you’ll understand what I’m talking about *wink* *wink*).Burning Man runs on laughter and ridiculous fun and the Mega Mega team of artists and builders are darned sure gonna bring it! Meet the Team!We have a blast making big art and connecting over our shared enthusiasm to bring Mega Mega to the burn. We'd love to meet you out there but until then, virtually meet the crew!

<h3>The Printmaking Friendship Story!<br/>
</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2008, after just graduating from college, I made plans to move to Madison, Wisconsin to begin a printmaking internship at <a href=""http://http://www.tandempress.wisc.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Tandem Press</a>. Needing a roommate and friends in this new city, I asked for the phone numbers of my soon-to-be fellow interns, and called Elizabeth Stoutamire in Georgia. I still have a very vivid memory of that phone call; we did not become roommates, but found an instant affinity with each other, working happily together in the print shop over the summer. Printmaking has served as a thread throughout our friendship, and has brought us together for many collaborations. We have made a tradition of visiting each other every few months, always brainstorming a new project, and excitedly making plans for the future.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In May 2009 during the opening for a print exchange and exhibition Elizabeth had organized in Madison, she mentioned something about a guy named Gabriel who had stopped by. She was unusually excited to see the fellow, and breathless when we hung out with him later that night. Something was afoot!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>That August Elizabeth visited Chicago and we made our first collaborative print together, a combination of etching and non-toxic photo-etching. In October of 2009 we printed together again, this time producing the screen printed show posters for an exhibition I'd curated. Gabriel drove Elizabeth to Chicago to attend the opening. A year later, in the fall of 2010 we collaborated for a third time on a series of screen prints and an etching, working into a plate with cotton blooms from Elizabeth's Southern childhood and trillium flowers from my youth in Eastern Ohio; flowers that both bloom white and decay to purple, marking the passage of time. By then, Gabriel had proposed to Elizabeth, and she was already talking about screen printing her invitations.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Another year has passed since then, and my life points from Chicago toward London for grad school. Elizabeth and Gabriel are getting married on October 15th, a few weeks after I move, and they've asked me to be in the wedding party. I very much want to return to Wisconsin to help them celebrate, and to give them my wedding gift---a photo-etching of Elizabeth and Gabriel, a hand-made print to commemorate three years of friendship and printmaking---but I can't do it without your help. </p>

<b>Mission
Statement:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
	We
are a group of artists committed to building a bridge between the
creative communities of Oakland and Guadalajara. 
</p>
<p>
	By
developing a network of artists, we aim to cross the divide between
Mexico and the USA. Oaklajara will facilitate an ongoing conversation
between these creative communities, expanding and enhancing
possibilities for individuals on both sides of the border.</p>
<p>
	Our
collective comprises both English and Spanish speakers. By engaging
local creators in the collaborative artistic process, we will create
a bilingual environment for the cross-pollination of artistic
endeavors.</p>
<p>
	We
all see and hear a lot of misleading news about Mexico and the United
States. To unite, build, create, and learn together is to break down
barriers and forge an understanding of our similarities as humans and
as artists.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p>
<p>
	Somos
un grupo de artistas comprometidos a la creación de un puente entre
las comunidades creativas de Oakland y Guadalajara.</p>
<p>
	A
través del desarrollo de una red de artistas, estudiantes y
mentores, nos proponemos cruzar la divición entre las naciones
fronterizas de México y EUA que facilitará a las comunidades
 creativas a involucrarse en un diálogo, expandiendo y
mejorando las posibilidades para individuos en ambas localidades.</p>
<p>
	Nuestro
colectivo se constituye de hablantes tanto de Inglés y Español, y
al involucrar a creadores locales en los procesos colaborativos
artísticos, crearemos un ambiente bilingüe para la mutua
polinización de intentos artísticos.</p>
<p>
	Todos
vemos y escuchamos muchos noticias engañosas acerca de México y de
EUA. El unir, construir, crear y aprender juntos es derrumbar

<b>Oaklajara
2013 Plan:</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span> The official dates of Oaklajara this year are November 15th - December 15th. Artists from Oakland, CA will be traveling to Guadalajara, JAL to collaborate with the artistic community there. We want to expand on some of the themes that were explored during last year's project, namely, focusing more on music and on having multiple events in different locations throughout the month. Last year Oaklajara teamed up with members of the art/sound collective S.P.A.Z. from Oakland (<a href=""http://www.spaz.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.spaz.org</a>), who brought to the table their skills in the realm of sound and their enthusiasm in planning &amp; setting up for events. In years past, Oaklajara has relied on musicians being able to provide their own sound equipment, or on renting equipment, limiting the freedom we had in terms of planning different events. This year, however, members of S.P.A.Z. along with some folks from Guadalajara will be driving a sound system south from Oakland for use throughout the entire Oaklajara project as a semi-permanent and mobile system. With this addition we will be seeking out temporary locations to organize even more social and artistic gatherings, growing our network, and making more projects and interactions possible. We hope that this will better aid us in collaborating with even more artists of all disciplines, allowing us the ability to take the party on the road and to host workshops throughout the month.</span></p>
<p>This year, in contrast to previous years where we have had just one night to showcase the art and music that has come together during the project, we want to have two main events in Guadalajara. One night will feature bands from Oakland and Guadalajara, and the other night will feature DJs and other electronic sound pioneers from both areas. Both events will include artwork and installations that we have created over the month of collaboration. We are also in communication with people in San Pancho and the San Pancho Art Collective to try and coordinate having a New Year's Eve event there.</p>
<p>The money we raise will be used for purchasing art supplies, renting event space, transporting the mobile creation station, documenting the project, and sharing our creations. The participants from Oakland will be funding their own travel and housing costs.</p>
<p>As always, the workshops and events will be free and open to the public. Oaklajara has been and will continue to be a collective comprised of those who show up and want to participate.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; display: inline !important;""><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Manifesto:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We exist underground.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We
are artists, musicians, vagabonds, poets, blacksmiths, DJs, welders,
scavengers, social workers, organizers, sound artists, chefs,
butchers, fashionistas, critical thinkers, hustlers, participators,
movers and shakers, cultural ambassadors, baristas, seekers of truth,
lovers of learning, and human beings. We live in Guadalajara, JAL,
and in the Bay Area, CA.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The
seeds of Oaklajara were first planted in 2010 when those of us from
the Bay Area first traveled to Guadalajara, JAL. While there, we met
and were inspired by the creative community there, and decided that
we wanted to collaborate with them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Since
then, Oaklajara has manifested itself in many ways. It started as an
idea to send art back and forth by mail. tThen, when that seemed
insufficient, it turned into a fundraiser event in Oakland where some
folks from Guadalajara came up to visit and to help with the creation
of art which would come to define Oaklajara's first project: creating
an archive of images which would facilitate the acquisition of
language skills for both native English and Spanish speakers looking
to increase their ability to communicate with each other. The
majority of the work that was made for this project was made from
salvaged and re-purposed materials and was created in Guadalajara, JAL, in the winter of 2012. The culmination of this project was a
gallery opening and free concert featuring three local bands held at
the Darjeeling tea house in Guadalajara.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Oaklajara's
second major project took place once again in Guadalajara during November and December of 2012. This time, we incorporated more music
into the creative process and were able put on and participate in
radio shows and to meet and collaborate with other musicians, all the
while continuing to host events at which we invited people to come
out and to make art out of materials scavenged from the landfill in Guadalajara. The main event took place on a rooftop in the form of a
free event where all of the artwork was displayed alongside of an
interactive art wall which was continually contributed to by the
attendees during the course of the event using materials provided by Oaklajara. the event also featured site-specific installations,

Statement:



	We
are a group of artists committed to building a bridge between the
creative communities of Oakland and Guadalajara. 


	By
developing a network of artists, we aim to cross the divide between
Mexico and the USA. Oaklajara will facilitate an ongoing conversation
between these creative communities, expanding and enhancing
possibilities for individuals on both sides of the border.

	Our
collective comprises both English and Spanish speakers. By engaging
local creators in the collaborative artistic process, we will create
a bilingual environment for the cross-pollination of artistic
endeavors.

	We
all see and hear a lot of misleading news about Mexico and the United
States. To unite, build, create, and learn together is to break down
barriers and forge an understanding of our similarities as humans and
as artists.



Declaración
de nuestra Misión:



	Somos
un grupo de artistas comprometidos a la creación de un puente entre
las comunidades creativas de Oakland y Guadalajara.

	A
través del desarrollo de una red de artistas, estudiantes y
mentores, nos proponemos cruzar la divición entre las naciones
fronterizas de México y EUA que facilitará a las comunidades
 creativas a involucrarse en un diálogo, expandiendo y
mejorando las posibilidades para individuos en ambas localidades.

	Nuestro
colectivo se constituye de hablantes tanto de Inglés y Español, y
al involucrar a creadores locales en los procesos colaborativos
artísticos, crearemos un ambiente bilingüe para la mutua
polinización de intentos artísticos.

	Todos
vemos y escuchamos muchos noticias engañosas acerca de México y de
EUA. El unir, construir, crear y aprender juntos es derrumbar
barreras y forjar un entendimiento de nuestras similitudes como
humanos y artistas.

Oaklajara
2013 Plan:


 
 The official dates of Oaklajara this year are November 15th - December 15th. Artists from Oakland, CA will be traveling to Guadalajara, JAL to collaborate with the artistic community there. We want to expand on some of the themes that were explored during last year's project, namely, focusing more on music and on having multiple events in different locations throughout the month. Last year Oaklajara teamed up with members of the art/sound collective S.P.A.Z. from Oakland (http://www.spaz.org), who brought to the table their skills in the realm of sound and their enthusiasm in planning & setting up for events. In years past, Oaklajara has relied on musicians being able to provide their own sound equipment, or on renting equipment, limiting the freedom we had in terms of planning different events. This year, however, members of S.P.A.Z. along with some folks from Guadalajara will be driving a sound system south from Oakland for use throughout the entire Oaklajara project as a semi-permanent and mobile system. With this addition we will be seeking out temporary locations to organize even more social and artistic gatherings, growing our network, and making more projects and interactions possible. We hope that this will better aid us in collaborating with even more artists of all disciplines, allowing us the ability to take the party on the road and to host workshops throughout the month.
This year, in contrast to previous years where we have had just one night to showcase the art and music that has come together during the project, we want to have two main events in Guadalajara. One night will feature bands from Oakland and Guadalajara, and the other night will feature DJs and other electronic sound pioneers from both areas. Both events will include artwork and installations that we have created over the month of collaboration. We are also in communication with people in San Pancho and the San Pancho Art Collective to try and coordinate having a New Year's Eve event there.
The money we raise will be used for purchasing art supplies, renting event space, transporting the mobile creation station, documenting the project, and sharing our creations. The participants from Oakland will be funding their own travel and housing costs.
As always, the workshops and events will be free and open to the public. Oaklajara has been and will continue to be a collective comprised of those who show up and want to participate.


Manifesto:

We exist underground.


We
are artists, musicians, vagabonds, poets, blacksmiths, DJs, welders,
scavengers, social workers, organizers, sound artists, chefs,
butchers, fashionistas, critical thinkers, hustlers, participators,
movers and shakers, cultural ambassadors, baristas, seekers of truth,
lovers of learning, and human beings. We live in Guadalajara, JAL,
and in the Bay Area, CA.


The
seeds of Oaklajara were first planted in 2010 when those of us from
the Bay Area first traveled to Guadalajara, JAL. While there, we met
and were inspired by the creative community there, and decided that
we wanted to collaborate with them.


Since
then, Oaklajara has manifested itself in many ways. It started as an
idea to send art back and forth by mail. tThen, when that seemed
insufficient, it turned into a fundraiser event in Oakland where some
folks from Guadalajara came up to visit and to help with the creation
of art which would come to define Oaklajara's first project: creating
an archive of images which would facilitate the acquisition of
language skills for both native English and Spanish speakers looking
to increase their ability to communicate with each other. The
majority of the work that was made for this project was made from
salvaged and re-purposed materials and was created in Guadalajara, JAL, in the winter of 2012. The culmination of this project was a
gallery opening and free concert featuring three local bands held at
the Darjeeling tea house in Guadalajara.


Oaklajara's
second major project took place once again in Guadalajara during November and December of 2012. This time, we incorporated more music
into the creative process and were able put on and participate in
radio shows and to meet and collaborate with other musicians, all the
while continuing to host events at which we invited people to come
out and to make art out of materials scavenged from the landfill in Guadalajara. The main event took place on a rooftop in the form of a
free event where all of the artwork was displayed alongside of an
interactive art wall which was continually contributed to by the
attendees during the course of the event using materials provided by Oaklajara. the event also featured site-specific installations,
photography, screen printing, and live music provided by local bands
and DJs from both Oakland and Guadalajara. The event was filmed and
the resulting footage was used to create a short documentary about Oaklajara and its participants.


Oaklajara
continues to grow and to connect people with one another. Some of us
got involved because we heard stories and saw pictures from the
events and were inspired to participate. Others of us have met at the
events and found kindred spirits - people who don't take everything
at face value and who think outside of the parameters prescribed to
us by our cultures and our societies. We open up our homes to each
other and create a space where like-minded individuals can meet and
get to know each other, and we get to have a lot of fun.


Oaklajara
will continue to show up, to participate, to support other people's
projects, to encourage people to explore themselves and the world
around them, to share skills and food, to cultivate an international
community of artists, and to create events where people can do things
that take them out of their normal routines. Oaklajara's events are
always free and have been made possible by a combination of
grassroots fundraising, networking, and the sharing of community
resources. 



Oaklajara
is collaborative, resourceful, international, exciting,
unintelligible, welcoming, inspiring, eclectic, non-hierarchical,
feral, creative, innovative, participatory, curious, and engaged. By
being a part of Oaklajara, we are able to embody our shared values of
freedom of expression, inclusivity, sustainability, and authenticity.


We
are Oaklajara.

<div>I Felt that I needed to add this in so everyone understands why I need this funding and hopefully clarify a few aspects of this campaign. The author Shauna Scheets is an Independent author working on limited funds and I myself an independent voice talent working with limited funds...this audio book is a royalty based project that I have volunteered for, so its success is needed for both of us. I want my voice to be heard and with your help it will happen and know your funds are not being wasted or miss used in any way. This is my entry into a new life and I am excited that I have even gotten this far. For everyone that has read and will read or even donate Thank you. </div>
<h3>Who I am and what I am trying to do:</h3>
<div>My name is Kane Silva and I live in Boise which is the lovely Capital of the state Idaho. All I have ever wanted to do in life is be successful, which I am sure everyone on here is attempting. The difference for me is that I truly am running out of options and just about the only thing left is this amazing place called IndieGoGo. </div>
<div>On the date of February 15th 2014 at approximately 3 am I suffered a severe seizure like spasm while I was driving home, which in turn put me into a concrete barrier at around 80 mph and rolled. This wreck has left me in a state where I have not been able to work due to my injuries. As of right now I have very few options or opportunities for employment which will allow the flexibility I now need. My options being; start my paperwork for disability or hope that a vocational rehabilitation program can find me some kind of work. This wreck has changed my outlook on life as I am sure anyone that has been through the same traumatic experience can attest to. I feel like this is a second life and I am only 27 years old I do not want to sit back and collect a barely survivable amount of money from the government. I need a career that I can be proud of and this is my goal here with you.</div>
<div>This campaign is my chance at a change...a real change that I thought was simply a pipe dream. I want to make this a reality and hope some of you wish the same for me.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Plan for the money:</h3>
<div>As I have mentioned in the video I need real and professional studio time to accomplish this goal. I have a local studio offering me time at $40 dollars an hour which is the best deal I can find. Some of the money will go towards buying equipment and software. I don't know how successful this campaign will be so studio time for the book is and will be the first option and equipment/software the last goal.</div>
<div>This audio book will be from the Author <b>Shauna Sheets</b> and the book titled <b>The Tower of Boran</b>.</div> <p>This book is my first break into the industry as well as an exciting but challenging venture.</p>
<ul></ul>

</div></div>","Funding Information:
I Felt that I needed to add this in so everyone understands why I need this funding and hopefully clarify a few aspects of this campaign. The author Shauna Scheets is an Independent author working on limited funds and I myself an independent voice talent working with limited funds...this audio book is a royalty based project that I have volunteered for, so its success is needed for both of us. I want my voice to be heard and with your help it will happen and know your funds are not being wasted or miss used in any way. This is my entry into a new life and I am excited that I have even gotten this far. For everyone that has read and will read or even donate Thank you. 
Who I am and what I am trying to do:
My name is Kane Silva and I live in Boise which is the lovely Capital of the state Idaho. All I have ever wanted to do in life is be successful, which I am sure everyone on here is attempting. The difference for me is that I truly am running out of options and just about the only thing left is this amazing place called IndieGoGo. 
On the date of February 15th 2014 at approximately 3 am I suffered a severe seizure like spasm while I was driving home, which in turn put me into a concrete barrier at around 80 mph and rolled. This wreck has left me in a state where I have not been able to work due to my injuries. As of right now I have very few options or opportunities for employment which will allow the flexibility I now need. My options being; start my paperwork for disability or hope that a vocational rehabilitation program can find me some kind of work. This wreck has changed my outlook on life as I am sure anyone that has been through the same traumatic experience can attest to. I feel like this is a second life and I am only 27 years old I do not want to sit back and collect a barely survivable amount of money from the government. I need a career that I can be proud of and this is my goal here with you.
This campaign is my chance at a change...a real change that I thought was simply a pipe dream. I want to make this a reality and hope some of you wish the same for me.   Plan for the money:
As I have mentioned in the video I need real and professional studio time to accomplish this goal. I have a local studio offering me time at $40 dollars an hour which is the best deal I can find. Some of the money will go towards buying equipment and software. I don't know how successful this campaign will be so studio time for the book is and will be the first option and equipment/software the last goal.
This audio book will be from the Author Shauna Sheets and the book titled The Tower of Boran. This book is my first break into the industry as well as an exciting but challenging venture.

  You Impacting my life:
Everyone has a dream and sometimes life gives a bit of a push to get you to pursue that dream as I know it has for me. I do not want to let this accident beat me so help me fight and stay strong.

am I doing this?</b></p>
<p>I’m a photographer from Campeche, at the Yucatan
Peninsula, in the Southeast of Mexico. I’ve been active in photography for the
last 9 years of my life and I’ve been able to show my work in many collective
exhibitions and also individual shows. My photos have been seen in
exhibitions in Mexico, USA, Cuba, Austria and Serbia. You can see my work in<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/here-now--4/edit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span> jpdeberman.com/en</span></a></p>
<p>I'm doing this crowdfunding project to make possible
my photo exhibition ""Here &amp; Now"", next September 15th in the main
gallery of <a href=""http://www.gradbeograd.eu/index_en.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>KC Grad</span></a>, considered <a href=""http://stillinbelgrade.com/top-10-art-spaces/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>one of the top 10 art
spaces</span></a> in Belgrade,
Serbia, and recognized in the whole Balkan region.  </p>
<p>The idea of this photo project, which has 16 pieces at mininum size of 50x70 cm, is to show different
kinds of relation that people have with their enviroment. Some of the pics are
posed, some not, but keeping an aesthetic that makes the spectator wonder if
the subjects are acting or not.</p>
<p>My idea is that we all play different roles in
society, in our surroundings. We're always wearing a mask, and depending where
we are is the mask we're using.</p>
<p>I like the idea of presenting in this project also
these images of people ""facing their fate"", people who are showed in
the way they are, maybe with their natural mask, in an environment where they
develop their normal lives.</p>
<p>This project
have been developed with analog and digital formats.</p>
<p><b>Why do I need your support?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>With your financial support I will be able to
     make this exhibition possible at all. Serbia (and the Balkans at all) is a
     difficult place to live from art. You need to do many other things to be
     able to support yourself as an artist, which means, not having enough time
     to dedicate yourself to art. Without your help I have to cover all for myself.</li>
<li>If the goal is reached, I will be able to exhibit
     ""Here &amp; Now"" with high quality prints and present them in
     lighboxes.</li>
<li>I will also print 50 special edition catalog of
     the exhibition.</li>
<li>If more money  than the goal is reached it
     will be used for starting my next project which is a shortfilm called
     ""One day"" that will be also done here in Serbia. </li>

MOVED.Visit: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/art-and-community-at-klg-education/x/15638175#/Thank you for understanding!Our MissionLocated in the heart of New Haven’s Westville village, Kehler Liddell Gallery (KLG) is a cooperative gallery owned and operated by member artists. Our mission is to represent, present, promote, and sell work of local contemporary artists. As champions of free speech, we do not censor our artists’ work or written statements. We are dedicated to representing critical perspectives that challenge and illuminate our culture and enrich our aesthetic experience.Our History Founded by 8 artists in 2003, KLG is New Haven’s longest running retail gallery to date, though KLG has always been more than just a store. An outgrowth of the Westville-based arts renaissance, KLG has anchored such beloved local arts events as the Westville Artwalk, the Halloween Parade and the Holiday Open House. Additionally, KLG has hosted a wide breadth of public programming charged by the excitement of cross-disciplinary collaborations, including projects with musicians, theatre troupes, filmmakers and authors.Our VisionWith more than a decade under our belt, KLG is looking to an even brighter future. In addition to presenting monthly high-quality art exhibitions – always free and open to all – we will expand gallery programming with a robust schedule of free and low-cost community arts programs and events for children, young people, adults and families. Artists will lead monthly story-time events, family movie nights, portfolio review days, artist talks, workshops, demos and more. An apprenticeship program will be established for students seeking to gain experience in a retail gallery. We are also actively seeking out additional partnerships to activate the gallery in new and exciting ways and to offer more artists the opportunity to share in our space for creative expression. In the last several months, we have started to present our ideas to the community. The response has been overwhelmingly positive.Our Funding PlanTo produce this programming, KLG is partnering with the ArtEcon Initiative, a new neighborhood-based non-profit. We are thrilled to announce our team has been awarded a Mayor's Neighborhood Cultural Vitality Grant from the City of New Haven. This campaign is our next step. Funds will support: part-time Arts + Programming Coordinator ($12,000); artist honorariums ($3,350), free materials and supplies for program participants ($2,200,), outreach and marketing ($800), overhead ($2,500), space use and occupancy ($4,150). Your donations will significantly contribute to our first year of community arts programming.Our PerksWe are offering some fantastic perks in exchange for your generous support. Artists have donated numerous artworks — many at bargain prices. In addition, our dedicated volunteers are offering curated brunches and cocktail parties at the gallery – all you have to do is show up! Please note: We welcome financial contributions in any amount. Any contribution that exceeds the value of the goods exchanged is tax deductible.See below, visit kehlerliddellgallery.com/programs, or stop into the gallery to view our perks.​Personal Thank You (email): $10Personal Thank You (postcard): $25Personal Thank You (postcard) + KLG Sticker: $35Artist Postcards, Set of 10: $50Rent Our Gallery: $500: Events are 4 hours.

<h3>Bringing Cameras to the Claraty Arts Project </h3>
<div>
<h3></h3>
<p>The Claraty Arts Project is teaming up with Courtney Bent, the producer of the award-winning documentary film, Shooting Beauty (see trailer below), and founder of the 100 Cameras Project, to put cameras into the hands of the Claraty artists with intellectual and developmental disabilities.   For many of our artists, this will be the very first time they have ever had the opportunity to take a picture.  Physical restrictions and expense have made it difficult for these individuals to do something many of us take for granted- capture a moment in a photograph.  But with the money raised through this campaign, we will be able to provide a photography workshop and create custom adaptive camera systems for each Claraty artist regardless of their disability, allowing them for the first time to express themselves and share their unique visions through photography.  If successful, the project will not only empower and build confidence in the new photographers, but will stand as an example of the potential of art to heal, to inspire, and to prove to all of us that no matter what our ability levels or differences are, we have more in common than what meets the eye.</p>
