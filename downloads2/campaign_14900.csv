<h3>Who I am, and why I need your help!</h3>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I'm Andy. I'm what you'd call an occasional freelance videogame critic (known mostly for my freelance contributions for IGN AU and for hosting the <a href=""http://switchfocuspodcast.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Switch Focus Podcast</a>), and videogames have been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>During early childhood they captured my imagination. They were a constant escape in my awkward teens. Most pertinently, they helped me through some pretty tough times in my twenties. At my loneliest, when I was sick to the back teeth of working in a job I hated, when I had <i>nothing</i> else, games were often the only thing that brought me joy.</p>
<p>That's what this is about.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518429346/gslkzuc6ktfjdnfrlcwc.jpg"" src=""""/>For years I've wanted to try my hand at writing fiction, and last year I finally gave it a go. I started small and followed the old idiom of 'write what you know' to pen a short, 8-page semi-autobiographical comic script about how important videogames were to me at a time I had nothing else.</p>
<p>The comic revolves around a character called Geoff, a twentysomething man working a 9-5 job that he absolutely hates, with nothing else going on but the repetition of existence. Yet, there is one escape that makes him happy. I think you can guess what that is.</p>
<p>Since I finished the script, I've been on the hunt for an artist to help bring my comic to life, and months later I've finally found one I want to work with.</p>

<p>For me, this project is <i>absolutely</i> non-profit. It's an experiment. Me taking my first steps as a creator rather than a commentator. When the comic is completed, I will release it on the internet for free.</p>
<p>The small amount I'm trying to raise in this campaign is solely to pay the artist, <a href=""http://alpacawesome.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Skye</a>, so that she can turn my words into pictures.</p>

<p>Should I achieve my funding goal, it will not only ensure that the comic definitely happens, but happens much quicker than not reaching it. If I don't reach the goal, I will still make every effort to get it completed and explore other avenues if I have to.</p>
<p>I have set the campaign up as 'Flexible Funding', so even if I don't beat the full total, I'll still be able to get the ball rolling.</p>

Hi folks,

What this campaign is for
For me, this project is absolutely non-profit. It's an experiment. Me taking my first steps as a creator rather than a commentator. When the comic is completed, I will release it on the internet for free.
The small amount I'm trying to raise in this campaign is solely to pay the artist, Skye, so that she can turn my words into pictures.

<h2>Who is Ghost Man?</h2>
<p>Kyle Glass was just a young freelance graphic artist trying to make it on it his own. His interest inlcude drawing, reading, playing videogames... and the paranormal. Together Kyle and his roomate Zach Hutchins report and blog about the things that go bump in the night.  </p>
<p>It all changes for Kyle when his grandfather dies, a man he respected more then anyone. At his grandfathers will reading Kyle is surprised to recieve a generous sum of money from the estate and something else. As a child Kyle's grandfather was a collecter of odd trinkets and artifacts, one thing in particular always caught young Kyle's eye. It was a necklace adorned with a blue crystal with a scythe blade on one side and an angel wing on the other. On the way home as Kyle admires the necklace he mugged, shot and left for dead in alley. Upon his death his spirit fuses with the strange trinket and transfroms Kyle into Ghost Man. Now he walks on both sides of the living and the dead trying to figure it all out</p>
<p>Want to know what happens next? Then help us get the first issue of Ghost Man off the ground. Come with us on his journey as goes up aginst zombies, black eyed kids, The Mothman and more. However to get to these adventures we need to Make Issue one a reality. </p>
<h2>What's the Money for?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>The bones you through towards Ghost Man will go toward paying the artist to draw the book, as well as printing up a small run. These copies we'll be used to help it go digitally later, they are basically being used to get the word about about Ghost Man and Illo comics which we hope to make into an online comic book company in the near future for not only Ghost Man but other titles as well.</p>
<p>The money we get from you is crucial to Ghost Man and Illo Comics. We don't have any funds right off the bat to make this happen we have to get it all form you guys, it's about as grass roots as you can get.</p>
<p>Any extra cash we get will go towards getting a few extra books printed up and go towards the second issue and maybe even the website for Illo Comics..</p>

<h2>Would you like to support the alternative arts and youth education at the same time? If so, please invest in my political comic book!</h2>
<p>I took a cartooning class at the <a href=""http://www.edalliance.org/index.php?src="" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Educational Alliance</a> in New York City to fulfill my childhood dream of being a cartoonist. This experience has inspired me to create my own comic book, <i>The Global Kid</i>, about a kid who grows up in countries around the globe (mirroring my own childhood). Through the first person narration of the main character, 14 year old Sami, we will learn about his nomadic life and his understanding of each country's politics. <strong><i>The comic book ultimately aims to </i><strong style=""font-style: italic;"">ente</strong><i>rtain and educate teen and adult readers about political risk, prediction and strategy </i>around the world </strong>– a topic I teach and write about for my work at NYU, Wikistrat and the Huffington Post's WorldPost.</p>
<p>But <i>The Global Kid</i> is also about helping youth reach their potential through education.<em><strong style=""font-weight: bold;""><em> 100% of comic book sales will go to global education non-profits that help youth reach their potential</em></strong></em>. Please help us cover production costs for a 32-page color comic book and support youth education at the same time. </p>

<p>But I am also the quintessential global kid, having lived in 7 different countries by age 14 and whose first love was cartoon drawing. When my family and I moved from Riyadh to London and then to Singapore in the early 1990s, I threw myself into my comic creations. Here are some of my first sketches of familiar characters when I was around 10-13 years old:</p>
<p>          <img alt=""Bunny"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/845635/pictures/full/20130602072940-Age_12_-_Rabbit_.jpg?1370183387"" src="""" style=""""/>             <img alt=""Spooky Family"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/845638/pictures/full/20130602073008-Age_12_-_Spooky_Family.jpg?1370183410"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Over 20 years later, I have returned to my first love, thanks to my cartooning class and teachers (artists extraordinaire <a href=""http://judekillory.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jude Killory</a> and <a href=""http://www.joshbayerart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Josh Bayer</a>) at the Educational Alliance. Here are a few sketches I did this year – some familiar characters which I gifted to my nieces, nephew, godson and friends' kids:</p>
<p><img alt=""Girl"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/845641/pictures/full/20130602073214-Dora_-_13.jpg?1370183540"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/> <img alt=""Dog"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/845645/pictures/full/20130602073346-Scooby_-_13.jpg?1370183632"" src="""" style=""""/> <img alt=""Family"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/845647/pictures/full/20130602073518-Simpsons_-_13.jpg?1370183724"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>These were all drawn using pencil, then inked with black pen and finally colored with markers. For the comic book, I am exploring different coloring techniques, including paints, brush pens and digital software for richer colors and a more professional look. Here is one of the first drafts of Sami, in pencil, ink, marker and digital color:</p>

<p>Below are a few very rough thumbnail sketches of introductory panels from different pages of <i>The Global Kid</i>. But keep in mind they will be redrawn (and the text will be typed) as I continue to develop the story. I'm also doing more research into the politics of the relevant countries and getting more input from education specialists about appropriate content on politics for teen readers.</p>

Here are some of my first sketches of familiar characters when I was around 10-13 years old:
                       
Over 20 years later, I have returned to my first love, thanks to my cartooning class and teachers (artists extraordinaire Jude Killory and Josh Bayer) at the Educational Alliance. Here are a few sketches I did this year – some familiar characters which I gifted to my nieces, nephew, godson and friends' kids:
  
These were all drawn using pencil, then inked with black pen and finally colored with markers. For the comic book, I am exploring different coloring techniques, including paints, brush pens and digital software for richer colors and a more professional look. Here is one of the first drafts of Sami, in pencil, ink, marker and digital color:
 
Below are a few very rough thumbnail sketches of introductory panels from different pages of The Global Kid. But keep in mind they will be redrawn (and the text will be typed) as I continue to develop the story. I'm also doing more research into the politics of the relevant countries and getting more input from education specialists about appropriate content on politics for teen readers.

<p class=""p1"">Satanic Mojo is spawned from a fascination with underground pop culture, youth tribes, street fashion, musical movements and so forth.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Whereas Victorian children were often clad in miniature versions of the three-piece-suits grown-ups, the modern teenager has always striven to find their own style.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The rise of pop culture is in many ways the history of the teenager, the rebels, the fashion tribes. Elvis hip-thrust was deemed indecent by TV as were Mary Quants high slashed mini skirts and The Beatles long hair.</p>
<p class=""p2""> From Hells Angels to Punks, Headbangers, Goths, Ravers or the hoodies of today youth tribes have routinely been demonised, shunned or banned from the pubs. The main connecting thread between all of these is that from Rock'n'Roll to Acid House, even comics and role-playing games, they have, at some point, been labelled as Satanic by a hysterical mass-media.</p>
<p class=""p1"">In Jan 2012 I started a blog, <a href=""http://www.satanicmojo.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.satanicmojo.blogspot.com</a>, taking a tongue-in-cheek look at the influence of the dark arts on pop culture.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Following this thread of influence I developed the idea of producing a series of limited edition artworks resembling ephemera from past decades.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Phase One looks at the counter-cultutre of the late 1960s.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Inspired by the dark side of psychedelia, The Process Church Of The Final Judgement, The Church Of Satan, the influence of Aleister Crowley &amp; his Thelemites on the hippy scene, LSD, Underground Comix, The Manson Family, conspiracy theory, Heavy Metal, Hammer Horror, etc.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The first collection of works comprises of:</p>
<p class=""p1"">a 36 page underground comic, lovingly rendered by a team of artists (inc Shaky Kane &amp; Garry Leach) to resemble the style of the day (36 pages limited to 666 copies); a psychedelic black-light poster with velvet flocking (artwork evocative of a classic rock festival poster), t-shirts, badges, patches, stickers and more...</p>
<p class=""p1"">With the current insipid, P.C. safeness of popular culture I feel it is important we remember the pioneering spirit and unabashed bravery of those psychedelic radicals who defended the right of free expression through their raw and visceral creations.</p>

<p class=""p3""><strong>So What Will It Look Like?:</strong></p>
<p class=""p3"">Satanic Mojo Comix will do its best to emulate the art styles of the late 1960s. It will be printed on an off-white pulpy paper stock, using old-fashioned risograph 'stencil duplicator' technology to reproduce a vintage 'off register' effect. </p>

<p class=""p3"">Interior pages will be in black and white, with the possible addition of further colours or pages should sufficient funds be found.</p>
<p class=""p3"">This 36 page comic will run to a limited edition of 666 copies. </p>
<p class=""p4"">The t-shirts will be short run, hand pulled screen prints produced using home-made D.I.Y screens to give that low budget vintage effect. This will also allow for special one-off/experimental garments to be produced, employing multiple prints, hand colouring etc.</p>
<p class=""p4"">Also, we plan to produce a poster print, in the style of the classic UV posters of the period, featuring a psychedelic witch enacting the rite of the Black Mass with a goat-masked cultist.</p>
<p class=""p3"">The poster will be a 4 colour screen print at A2 size</p>
<p class=""p3"">(420 x 594mm - 16.5 x 23.4 in)</p>
<p class=""p3"">It will be printed in UV reactive fluorescent colours with flocked blacks to give that traditional black velvet effect.</p>

What's the story?:
The legend of Satanic Mojo begins with a potent batch of Black Acid known as Satanic Mojo or LSD666.
This acid is reputed to give dark occult visions, out of body experiences, and allow contact with certain entities.
As the 'Summer Of Love' makes way for the 'Summer Of Bad Craziness', ""Black Acid"" achieves a cult status amongst a certain sector of the hippy community obsessed with the occult revival and rennaissance of Satanism.
In 1968 a San Francisco-based artist collective is established, woking under the Satanic Mojo banner.
 

 
Over the next year they produce a series of t-shirts, posters and comix, until things are brought to an un-timely end when the studio is destroyed by fire.
Myriad rumours circulate regarding the fire. It is believed that they have 'stepped on the toes' of a local Coven, or that they had caused the fire themselves by meddling with forces man was meant to leave alone. These rumours in turn go on to inspire a shlocky and exploitative grindhouse movie, and a whole generation of artists and musicians throughout the 70s up to the present day.

In Jan 2012 the popular Satanic Mojo blog appears, dedicated to providing a tongue in cheek look at the influence of the dark arts on popular culture.

The Creative Team:
Please allow me to introduce myself, my name is Jason Atomic. I'm a London based British artist. 
Despite having a background in self produced comix, I have been away from the medium for the last 20 years, concentrating more on drawing and painting from life. I have exhibited internationally and in 2008 set an un-offical World land speed record for portraiture at the National Portrait Gallery.
Recently I began curating comic-inspired group shows and performance events at Resistance Gallery & Orbital comics in London. These include The Iconography Of Mask, Hail To The King, Stripped and The Magick Eye. I have written for various magazines in the UK & Japan including Tokyo Journal, Pimp, Alternative London and The Illustrated Ape (for which I art-edited the latest issue)
For this project I have recruited a team of comic creators including UK comics legends Shaky Kane (Deadline, Bulletproof Coffin)and Garry Leach (2000ad, Warrior,A1) as well as American indie/underground creators Paul Lyons (Monster) and Dennis Franklin (Monster & movie art department for 'House of the Devil').

These items are intended as art objects which will form a metafictional collection of facsimile ephemera from the mythical Satanic Mojo Studio.
Only half the print run will be available through this indiegogo campaign. The rest will go on to form part of a multi-medi group exhibition and performance event to be held in London.
 
What you'll get if you contribute:
There are a wide range of perks available. 

Badges, patches and stickers featuring the sigil of Satanic Mojo.

This sigil was designed by Jinx Dawson, of Satanic psychedelic acid rock group Coven. 
It was Jinx, a practicing witch, who back in the 1960s introduced the sign of the horned hand to the rock scene. 
All perks will come together with a specially distressed certificate.

 ""Do What Thou Wilt... Then Split""
(See image above in Legend of Satanic Mojo)
A t-shirt featuring a cartoon version of Aleister Crowley in familiar triangle hat making the sign of Pan whilst walking in a pose reminiscent of R. Crumb's classic ""Keep On Truckin'"" shirt. 
 
""Creepy Crawl"" 

Manson family inspired t-shirt featuring the title ""Creepy Crawl"" and a hairy hippy spider with a Charile Manson death's head on its abdomen.
""Satanic Mojo T-shirt""

The Satanic Mojo logo flanked by a pair of winged demons.
 The Satanic Mojo Black Light Poster
 The Satanic Mojo diffusion range Poster
The same design as the other poster but printed in one colour (black) on fluorescent paper.
Satanic Mojo Comix, 36 page comix with colour cover and B/W interior.
 
 Where Will Your Money Go?:
The funds raise through this indiegogo campaign will go towards printing/material costs for Satanic Mojo Comix, the posters and t-shirts, as well as a fee for contributing artists.
Should the goal be exceeded, additional money raised would allow me to pay a bonus to contributors, to further enhance the finished product (better quality material, more colours, etc) or to add new designs to the collection.
 
Flexible Funding:
I am committed to producing this comic & poster and will go ahead with or without my complete goal being reached. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help:
If you're still not convinced but want to help this project gain some momentum, we would be delighted if you'd share our links on Facebook, twitter and other social media platforms. 
Wether you are contributing of not we'd be delighted to hear your feedback in the comments section above.
Follow the Satanic Mojo blog.
Any bloggers or journalists out there with an interest in the Satanic influence on pop culture - I am available for interviews and will be happy to discuss this project in more depth. 
 
""For Open Minded Adult Intellectuals Only"" :
In the spirit of the counter-culture of the late 1960's these limited edition art objects will feature erotica, macabre themes and drug references. As such, they are intended for a mature audience.",10.0,0,"3 Campaigns

About me
 
The art of jean-Sebastien Lajeunesse reflects a search and exploration on 
imaginary worlds. Within his strange universe, he sits on the ground surrounded 
by archives, tools, sculptures and recycled materials. Pencil in hand, the line 
dares, bursts, comes alive and multiplies, creating stretched forms, texturded 
and contrasted. Fantasy characters come out of nowhere, twisted, fragiles and 
fluids, they all juggle with old memories. All these small symbolic creatures 
tell about their joys and sorrows. A theatrical study that plays with the 
character's emotions. New worlds surges on heterogeneous objects in various 
techniques and different mediums. The idea starts with a vision, will tranform, 
shimmer and expand like a dance reaching for the indefinable, always open to 
new interpretations.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello possible contributors! My name is Will Laury, character actor, comedian, musician, singer-songwriter and CEO of Bad Daddy Productions. I am currently attending The Los Angeles Film School in Hollywood, scheduled to graduate in April 2011. I studied cinematography, production, editing, screenwriting, etc., although my passion by definition, is being an entertainer. I’m set to star in this screener film as a pre-emptive showpiece of the premise of a concept I have for a film, then series, of a weekly variety comedy/drama called <i>“WIL:DO’S WORL:D”</i>  that I have created and of which I am the star talent. This short film is a pre-emptive showpiece of the premise of this aspiration. I understand the general inner workings, or should I say the background of film and production, and of being on “the set” and all that it entails that this short film will set the stage for in this show based on the struggles of a street performer, Wildo, (pronounced Will-doe) who goes totally “Hollywood” sans the Hollywood ego, after much resistance. As a consequence it will exhibit the range of my talents (well, some of them anyway) and to introduce “Wildo,” the main character, to the (entertainment) world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The contract I have made to and for myself:  I am determined to not only complete this project, (even with minimal funding), but to proceed with the larger than life ambitious goal to effect my brainchild, “<i>WIL:DO’S WORL:D”</i>. Oh yes people, it’s going down.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Basics in what I need is donated time ,energy, and work ethic, but mostly your contributions...</p>
<p>...Because that will pay for:</p>
<p>             *The make-up person, costumes and props--which is extensive for I will be portraying several characters.</p>
<p>             *Craft services to supply eats for my cast and crew.</p>
<p>             *Permits and fees</p>
<p>             *And and all other costs incurred that is bound to rear its ugly head.</p>
<p>Any excess of raised contributions--which we obviously don’t anticipate at this juncture--will be applied to the production and funding of the film and subsequent series, “WIL:DO’S WORL:D”.</p>

<p>Masked vigilante <strong>THE PURPLE TIGRESS</strong> first appeared in print in 1944. After two short adventures she disappeared from publishing...until now.</p>
Scott T. Hicken, a longtime comic book reader and fan, conceived and wrote the new story for <strong>The Purple Tigress</strong> and her fellow masked vigilantes. His friend Greg Baker, a fellow comic aficionado and writer, helped edit and refine the story. Using old comic book characters that have lapsed into the public domain Scott and Greg decided to pen a new tale that maintained the 1940s setting instead of flashing forward the characters to the present day. The comic will be drawn by the amazing artistic team of Andrea + Ale.<br/><p>Anita Morgan, a.k.a. <strong>The Purple Tigress</strong>, has been reimagined as a fiercely independent woman trying to find her way in the societal boundaries of the 1940s - even while maintaining continuity with her first two published adventures. Assisted by her housemaid Prissy and the miniaturized informant Ritty, Issue #1 introduces a new and fantastic transformation of Anita's goals and abilities. Nearly forgotten characters Mavara, Merciless the Sorceress, Jean Starr, and Bert McQuade round out the cast.</p>
<p>This Fundraiser is to raise the money needed to illustrate the 30 page Issue #1, and there will be two ways to get it - pledge $10 or more and you will get a PDF copy when all the pages are complete. Once those have been distributed, <strong>Purple Tigress #1</strong> will start posting page-by-page on <a href=""http://www.purpletigress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PurpleTigress.com</a> for everyone to read. Revenue generated by ads and other income will go towards the creation of Issue #2 (of a planned 6 issue arc).</p>
<p>Please note: the writers view incidental and tasteful nudity as part of life and art. There are two versions of Issue #1 that will be available; one artfully censored and one uncensored. You will be able to specify which you want when pledging.</p>
</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$3,000 will fund about two-thirds of Issue #1 (thanks to fees), but we think it is the most realistic goal to set. We have a few rewards for funding our project:</p>

<p><strong>$15 - $19 pledge</strong>: The above, and a Character Guide highlighting some of the public domain characters you will see in Issue #1, with old and new character art</p>
<p><strong>$20 - $25</strong>: The above, and the first two Purple Tigress adventures redrawn by our artists to act as a bridge between Anita's original adventures and our Issue #1</p>

<p>My name is Jerry Richardson. I have been living in Japan and China over the past 10 years. When Anchor Face was forced into exile I just happened to be on the same ship that he set sail on.

<p>There weren't many others on the ship we set sail on and my background in tattoo design was the closest he could get it an illustrator. So the style in the book is influenced by nautical tattoo designs of the early 1900's. Norman Collins is one of my favorite tattoo artists so his style influences my work. I also like to read Popeye comic strips and watch Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli movies so there might be a little of that in the work as well. If Anchor Face likes my style for this first book then I hope to do more issues for him but from what I can gather we are sailing to Japan or China at the moment, he might get a new artist from there if he doesn't like my work. I hope I can illustrate another few issues for him at least, even though I get seasick I have loved creating this first issue.</p>
<p>I have seen some amazing things so far on our adventures, things that I could never have imagined. I've been to places that I didn't even know existed and this is all because of Anchor Face. That being said my favorite part of sailing with Anchor Face has been getting to know him and his new crew. Even though I'm just the comic book writer he has still made me feel part of the team. Some say he can be a little cold and steely-eyed but getting to know him I've found he has a good heart, he always looks out for his mates, he has a passion for justice and has dedicated his life to doing what's right.

Who is Anchor Face?

Welcome Aboard. Anchor Face has resurfaced after having gone missing somewhere on the bottom of the ocean for 10 years. He went missing after being double-crossed by one of his team members and when he finally resurfaced everything had changed. His old superhero team had been decommissioned. All teams have been decommissioned except one government approved superhero team. Achor Face has heard that some of his old team members had escaped to various locations around the world. Come and join Anchor Face on his Odyssey around the world to find his old team members and discover what has happened over the past 10 years as he explores exotic locations, battling ancient beasts and encountering bizarre cultures as well as making new friends and powerful new allies in the fight for all that is good and just.
Some of Anchor Face's adventures are set out at sea but many more are set in the countries and far-off lands that he is forced to explore.
 

Progress Update
 

26 pages of the comic have been drawn, painted and lettered already. When it is completed it will be a 32-page comic book and is the 1st in the Anchor Face series. The funding will be used for the printing of the book.

But, please, keep in mind that I will have limited copies of the book, prints etc. If you want to make sure that I will have your perk at Comicdom send me an e-mail at elenagarts@gmail.com titled ""Bloodfest-Comicdom""  with your full name and your perk.About the bookBloodfest: Bad Blood is the first installment of a bigger story and my first attempt at creating a webcomic. It launched on Tapastic in 2016 and has since gained a small but solid following. A little over a year later it was successfully completed. You can read the entire thing online:
https://tapas.io/series/bloodfest
http://bloodfestcomic.tumblr.com/
The goal now is to create a printed version of the comic, so that you can enjoy it whenever and wherever you want, even when the Wi-Fi is wonky. The printed version will include the already existing pages and some exclusive comics & illustrations that are not available online.The campaign will run on a fixed goal, so if you want a physical copy make sure to contribute to the campaign before it ends. The money raised will be used to cover the printing and shipping costs and various other fees.The comic book will be a full-color paperback. It will be 88 pages long and 17x24cm in size and it will roughly look like this:Please, note, that the comic is not suitable for younger readers as it contains intense violence, blood and gore, sexual content and strong language. About the storyBloodfest: Bad Blood is about vampires, humans and whatever is in-between. It has a little bit of action, a little bit of horror and a lot of suspense. And leather. A lot of shiny leather.The protagonist is a vampire-human hybrid who calls himself “Nate”. The story starts as Nate wakes up, exhausted and disoriented, in the company of two Vampire Hunters. The three of them are being held in a cell by the Brotherhood, a vampire criminal organization. Now they have to sort out their differences and work together in order to escape.The story and the characters are heavily inspired by some of my favorite movies from the late 90s and early 2000s, like Blade, Underworld, Resident Evil and a variety of Van Damme and Seagal movies. The idea behind this comic was to take elements from these movies and combine them into a more modern and diverse story.About the PerksBut the comic book isn't all you get! Bookmarks:With every physical copy of the comic you get two of these badass bookmarks!Prints:(A4 Print Pack, A5 Prints Pack, ALL Prints Pack, EVERYTHING Pack)And don't forget the wide variety of prints! From A5 to A3, on good quality paper. Hang them all over your home and drive your housemates mad!   Tote Bag:(Tote Bag Pack, EVERYTHING Pack)You can also get this sexy 33x33cm tote bag, made of Polyester Poplin fabric, with a 35cm-long cotton shoulder strap. Perfect for carrying your copy of the comic around and making all your friends jealous!  Original Artwork & Commissions:Original Artwork Pack: One lucky contributor will get to have the two original ink drawings below, on thick A5 paper. EVERYTHING Pack: Two other lucky people will get two ink commissions on thick A5 paper (like the ones below)! You can ask for one character of your choice with a simple background (nothing too explicit, please).""Undead"" comic:(Bloodfest & Undead Pack)Are you a Greek-speaking contributor? Well, It's your lucky day! If Bloodfest: Bad Blood wasn't enough, you can also get the three issues of my zombie comic Undead! I self-published it in three parts from 2015 to 2017. It's about a zombie outbreak in the Greek town of Patras. Each issue is 20-24 pages long and 14,8x21cm in size.Undead IS NOT IN ENGLISH. Please don't choose this perk if you can't read Greek.How can you help?If you want to help but your budget won’t allow it, don’t fret! There are other ways:

TimeframeThe comic is completed and the book is ready for printing. Once the campaign is over and the money transferred I will, immediately, start getting all the items ready. Since I have never used crowdfunding before, I may deal with unexpected difficulties. But I’m sure that all the books will be shipped in the following 1-3 months after the campaign's end.Of course, I will keep you updated about everything!About the creatorElena Gogou is an aspiring artist from Greece. She recently received a Master’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Patras, but, to her family’s disappointment, has decided to pursue a career as an illustrator and comic artist. She has been creating comics as a hobby since 2014. You might have stumbled on her work at a Greek comic convention or on social media.  Or you might have never heard of her, in which case, hi.

The story takes place in the vibrant, synth-pop filled era of the 1980's in the loud, crowded streets of New York City.  Where we left with FALLEN #1, the Godfather himself Zeus was murdered right in front of his ward Casper Clay. The criminal world of deities was sent reeling at the news of an immortal god being taken out. While the Greek family is scrambling to react, Casper's life is sent spiraling as he is expelled from his previous life and exiled from the world he once served...Who Will Like FALLEN?Obviously fans of the first book will really enjoy this one but if you're just getting on board now and you like any of these things, you're going to love FALLEN;80's Pop Culture - FALLEN is inspired by and infused with a lot of the 80's classics from music,  movies and style.Mythology - Doesn't matter if you're a fan of Greek, Norse or any other mythology, FALLEN is going to touch on it all.Crime Thriller - If you're intrigued by stories of crime, murder and mystery. It's like a mash up of John Wick, Constantine and Clash of the Titans.FALLEN is inspired by neo-noire stories like Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049 and fantasy stories like Fables and The Wolf Among Us.Press:""FALLEN provides a new spin on an old tale and does it by infusing the story with dirt, grime, and some godly magic. FALLEN is a must-read for lovers of mythology, crime dramas, or well-constructed comics."" -  Monkeys Fighting Robots ""If you enjoyed Hercules or The Odyssey (the Poem and subsequent 90s mini-series) – then you’ll lap up what this comic book has in store for you."" -  Soda and Telepaths  Rewards Preview:Issue 1 CoverIssue 1 Variant CoverIssue 1 Page 1Issue 1 Page 2Issue 1 Page 3Issue 1 Page 4Issue 2 CoverIssue 2 Page 1 (black and white)Issue 2 Page 2 (black and white)Issue 2 Page 3 (black and white)Creative Team:The team has stayed the same with the three of us still passionately working on the series;Matt: Creator and Writer of FALLEN.

<p>Hi! I’m Brian Defferding – author, artist and publisher of the gothic horror graphic novel series “School.” This is my Indiegogo fundraiser for the sixth issue of the series.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with the story, I’ll give you a little background. The story centers around a 12-year-old girl named Lindsay, it begins with her “waking up” inside an elementary school, covered in blood. Furthermore, she realizes she’s not just covered in blood, she is actually dead and is a ghost, ever-living inside the walls of the school, with little memory of her past. This story is about her recollecting her past, unraveling the mystery behind her death, and meeting some other ghostly friends – and enemies – along the way. It’s creepy, it’s frightening, it’s tragic, it’s something COMPLETELY different from any other comic you have ever read or seen.</p>
<p>This book started out as my senior project at Minneapolis College of Art and Design all the way back to 2001. I got 12 pages done; almost one-half of the issue. After I graduated, I put the pages away, forgetting about it for a few years. When I moved back to my hometown in Wisconsin in 2003, after unpacking my art I found those pages again; and realized this was a great idea with so much potential to be a wonderful story. Thus, I picked up where I left off, and my first 32 page self-published, self-distributed comic came out in June 2005. I have been at it ever since, working on it when I can, selling and promoting it at conventions around the US.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need, What You Will Get</h3>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>Because this venture is pretty much a one-man show, and it is not distributed through Diamond Comics Previews catalog, this is where you come into play. I need to raise money for printing costs of both the sixth issue as well as reprints of the previous issues; and I have TONS of awesome merch and swag to toss in for anyone that wants to jump on board - from custom commission drawings, hand-painted tile coasters, T-shirts and mugs to an eight-piece poster set. I’ll also be selling paintings. Stretch goals will include reprints of previous issue, hardcover options, and more merch/swag for the masses!

For those of you who are not familiar with the story, I’ll give you a little background. The story centers around a 12-year-old girl named Lindsay, it begins with her “waking up” inside an elementary school, covered in blood. Furthermore, she realizes she’s not just covered in blood, she is actually dead and is a ghost, ever-living inside the walls of the school, with little memory of her past. This story is about her recollecting her past, unraveling the mystery behind her death, and meeting some other ghostly friends – and enemies – along the way. It’s creepy, it’s frightening, it’s tragic, it’s something COMPLETELY different from any other comic you have ever read or seen.
This book started out as my senior project at Minneapolis College of Art and Design all the way back to 2001. I got 12 pages done; almost one-half of the issue. After I graduated, I put the pages away, forgetting about it for a few years. When I moved back to my hometown in Wisconsin in 2003, after unpacking my art I found those pages again; and realized this was a great idea with so much potential to be a wonderful story. Thus, I picked up where I left off, and my first 32 page self-published, self-distributed comic came out in June 2005. I have been at it ever since, working on it when I can, selling and promoting it at conventions around the US.


What I Need, What You Will Get
   Because this venture is pretty much a one-man show, and it is not distributed through Diamond Comics Previews catalog, this is where you come into play. I need to raise money for printing costs of both the sixth issue as well as reprints of the previous issues; and I have TONS of awesome merch and swag to toss in for anyone that wants to jump on board - from custom commission drawings, hand-painted tile coasters, T-shirts and mugs to an eight-piece poster set. I’ll also be selling paintings. Stretch goals will include reprints of previous issue, hardcover options, and more merch/swag for the masses!

""Squidface"" 9""x9"" print - goes with a $30 contribution along with a copy of the book.
""The Lake"" 11""x17"" print - goes with a $50 contribution along with a copy of the book.
""Transistor Infection"" 12x12 print - receive this with the sixth issue with a $30 contribution!

<h3>What's P2 anyway?</h3>
<p>President- Charsya Paul<br/>Vice President- Moyia Hardeman<br/>Video Editor- Kimberly Rogers</p>
<p>P2 Manga was established in July 2008. It was created by Charsya Paul, an aspiring OEL manga artist who wanted to make her mark for something she believe strongly in. So why the word manga instead of comics? ""Manga"" in nothing but a word that means comics. Because manga is so popularized in American society, what other way to get artist interested than to have them relate to something so familiar.</p>
<p>Charsya realized how a lot of American artist who were interested in the manga drawing style weren't really looked upon for the very reason OEL is frowned upon--they weren't from Japan. OEL mangas have a story to tell too,and this sparked the birth of P2.

<p>Moyia and I have struggled to get a good fan base over these 5 years we've been active. So far our statistics show that we have a good fan base in France, Philippines, as well as the United States. HOW AWESOME IS THAT! We've had fans purchase our unique books from our site as well as online stores. However, even though we've had sales with our books, we also had to belt out more than what was coming In. so here's how you can help, we are relying on you our wonderful fans and supporters of OEL mangas everywhere to help contribute to our cause. We want to keep the good fight for fellow OEL manga artists' everywhere to show them that there is a company out here that want to help people realize their dreams of being published. If you are able to help support this cause you will recieve a nice bundle of stuff depending on the amount you give.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As we mentioned, in our quest to expand our reach in the publishing world we hit a lot of bumps In the road. We had to belt out a lot of money to try to straighten things out and to be sure to pay our lovely authors of these wonderful books That they created. We were able to limp this far but our legs have finally given out. We are hanging on by a thread to keep this dream alive for not only us and our authors, but to those who believe in our goal we set forward. This money would be used to slowly pick up the damaged pieces of our fragile little company so we can start over and try another approach at pleaseing all parties involved in this endeavor. We are proud to have said that we started out as an artist trying to realize her dream and backed up by family and friends able to stand for 5 years. Year by year we have learned what it means to publish OEL titles and the hardship it takes to push these titles to become equal with that of Japanese manga.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to help us financially then help by spreading the word to other fans of OEL manga artist and small press companies. Either way we will be greatly appreciactive of any help we can get. Please help us in our campaign, and trust  us when we say that we hate to even ask this, but our authors wanted us to give it our best shot! So we hope to do our best for them!</p>

<p>P2 Manga started out as a small project but has grown to much, much more. If our goals are met we have a couple of ideas in order to help our artist. They include ebooks, magazines, and possibly more titles. These funds are for the sole purpose of being able to help young artist get their stories published. Because of the trouble we are in, we had to close our submission period disappointing <strong>A LOT</strong> of aspiring artist. With this money, we can push our titles further out of Louisiana and get the physical books in stores around the world. With this, we can possibly expand our company little by little. We can continue being the light that allows artist to take a stand and say ""I want to be recognized!"" We have so many ideas and because of what has happened we havent had the chance to show how great P2 Manga can truly be.</p>
</div></div>","What's P2 anyway?
President- Charsya PaulVice President- Moyia HardemanVideo Editor- Kimberly Rogers
P2 Manga was established in July 2008. It was created by Charsya Paul, an aspiring OEL manga artist who wanted to make her mark for something she believe strongly in. So why the word manga instead of comics? ""Manga"" in nothing but a word that means comics. Because manga is so popularized in American society, what other way to get artist interested than to have them relate to something so familiar.
Charsya realized how a lot of American artist who were interested in the manga drawing style weren't really looked upon for the very reason OEL is frowned upon--they weren't from Japan. OEL mangas have a story to tell too,and this sparked the birth of P2. Although some of the artist that worked along side her were not American, she also pushed for their work as well. Along with her cousin Moyia Hardeman, we have dedicated ourselves to our artistsby making their dreams come true and even helping artist improve where their weakness' are. Moyia has taken out time in her school schedule to critique artist, help them develop a stronger story and grasp the concept of the importance of being original.

<p>Dear Reader,</p>
<p>My name's Atabay and I'd like to tell you why I think my book 21st Century Man is worth your investment. </p>
<p>21st Century Man is an original graphic novel of 70 pages with art by Kostas Pantoulas (Lost In Space: The Lost Adventures, Electromagnate: The Book of Rebel Nations), lettering by Buddy Beaudoin (Prat) &amp; Lucas Gattoni (Kinetic), and beautiful covers by up-and-coming concept illustrator Julian Cruz. </p>
<p>21st Century Man focuses on the daily life of David, a jaded city  dweller struggling to keep up with the expectations of modern society. </p>
<p>The world births us, raises us with its own arbitrary and often times nonsensical standards of behavior then shoots us like a cannon ball into adult world. We're left with very little insight as to how we tick, or what we truly want. How could we possibly hope to understand our fellow travelers when we're complete mysteries to ourselves? This is where the Monster comes in. The Monster's vicious, unrelenting and he has an insatiable appetite for human flesh. He also pushes away everyone close to David and ruins his every shot at having a productive, successful life. Just like the monster inside of you, then.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 deals with the place the Monster takes in David's life as he attempts to live the way one ought to. Well paying, but menial job. Finding a soul compatible with your own. Becoming something more than just a complex system of synapses in a closed off vessel. Chapter 2 sees our protagonist suffer the repercussions of his innate malevolence and his struggle to drop his bad habits, complete with nightmarish visions of a world dead-set on making his life a living hell. Chapter 3 investigates the role the Monster plays in the lives of others, and the various ways it affects them, for better or worse. Would David put a hold on his own suicide to help a child retrieve his lost balloon?</p>
<p>You might think that all sounds like portentous dribble (it is), however the book will employ these grand themes to tell a character driven story of ordinary people playing the game of life with a bad hand. Our protagonist is molded in the tradition of Patrick Bateman (American Psycho), Elliot Alderson (Mr. Robot), and Tyler Durden (Fight Club); all intellectuals suffering from a deep moral rot, of which is usually manifested as a hatred of others and a disconnect from reality. We will take that template of protagonist and drop him in the framework of something like (500) Days of Summer.</p>
<p>The book is finely penciled, hand inked and painted with water colors. It is also mostly presented to you in pages with 5 or 6 panels of equal size like window panes allowing you to bear witness to the intimate truths of peoples' souls. It truly looks like nothing else on the stands today. I now present to you the covers of our 3 chapters, as well an excerpt of chapter 2.</p>

<h3>A Unique Veteran History and Art Project.</h3>
<p>At Full Mag we work with military veterans to present their first-person stories, in their words, in our high-quality graphic novel and military history magazine.  Our team of veterans and historians captures stories that would otherwise be lost to the ages while providing a platform for artists to honor the veteran storytellers.  Each story presented is the result of an interview by the Full Mag team, or the written word of the storyteller. </p>
<p>Our second volume just won the 2020 MWSA Gold Medal award in the graphic novel category. </p>
<p>Now we are set to publish the third volume of this award winning series and we need your help.</p>
<p>Full Mag: Veteran Stories Illustrated, Vol. 3 is bigger and better than ever... 10 stories, 88 pages,  magazine sized, perfect bound, printed in the USA in full color on 80# paper.   These amazing first-person stories, illustrated by the best graphic artists, can only be told by those who experienced the events themselves.  This volume includes the amazing veteran stories of:</p>
<ul>
<li>WW II Combat Engineer, crossing the Rhine- by Harold Vachal, art by J.W. Erwin</li>
<li>WW II Soldiers overrun during the Battle of the Bulge- by Bob Buntin, art by Gary Martin</li>
<li>WW II Airman shot down over Italy- by Eldon Dahl, art by Nossretep</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The largest expenses, by far, for this unique veteran history project are the costs of paying artists and printing. </p>
<p>We believe in paying artists competitive page rates and that is what we do.  For many reasons Full Mag must be printed in the USA and it is!  We believe in putting out the highest quality product and putting quality and care into every step of this process and that is what we do.  This volume represents untold thousands of hours of time from the veterans and our team.  You the customer and sponsor benefit from all of this. </p>
<p>When you support our campaign and receive your copies of Full Mag, <u>you are part of the team that obtains and presents the stories of these veterans while supporting the arts in a real way, by providing paying work to artists.</u>  You receive the product of thousands of hours of work and the opportunity to read these amazing first-person accounts in a wonderfully engaging format.  This is unlike any other veteran history project. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Gold Medal Review &amp; Testimony from Veteran Participants</h3>
<p>The feedback from veteran participants and/or their families is quite moving.  Here we share some of those quotes and from the Military Writers Society of America review of our most recent volume, which won the 2020 Gold Medal in the graphic novel category...  </p>
<p><i>FULL MAG is a terrific read, a terrific graphic novel, and a terrific tribute to the men and women of the armed forces. Strongly recommended.</i> -- MWSA Review</p>
<p><i>The whole magazine is excellently done. I was so impressed by the art. The story is so well done. Thank you for a great job.  I can't wait till I can give them to my family. --  </i>quote from Vietnam veteran storyteller</p>
<p><i>I also want to tell you how meaningful it was for my Dad to know that his stories would live on. What you are all doing is such important work.  </i><i>Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</i>-- quote from daughter of WW II storyteller</p>
<p><i>Yesterday was the 75 Anniversary of Operation Market Garden.  They celebrate it still. Yesterday church bells ringing at 10:45: the hour the airborne forces left England: ceremonies and memorials all day long.  Today allied vets come for ceremony at Grave just north of St Hubert's.  I sent a copy of Full Mag... to.... She took your Full Mag to her class: this Anniversary they wrote essays on the subject: over here [America] none know about it unless you're a historian!!! -- </i>quote from storyteller wife of WW II veteran.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>A Great Opportunity</h3>
<p>This campaign has a very low risk of non-fulfillment.  We have done this before and practice the philosophy of continuous improvement.  You will receive your product. </p>
<p>The art and printing costs for this veteran history project are very high.  However, Full Mag also makes a great gift and it is important to share these veteran stories.  This combines to create an opportunity for sponsors.  We humbly ask that you pick up some extra copies.  Providing copies of Full Mag to your network shows folks that you are part of the team that is obtaining and presenting these stories so they are not lost.     </p>

<h3>You are not alone!</h3>
<p>Full Mag is also sponsored by First Spear, Magpul Industries, Hoplite Industries, Hamilton &amp; Co. CPAs, and the Veterans Leadership Program.  Without these sponsors, we could not do this.  You will see their amazing ads in this volume. </p>
<p>In addition, Full Magazine Publishing has also donated ad space to several organizations in this volume including: Warriors and Quiet Waters, the American Legion, the Montana Veterans Memorial, and the Semper Fi &amp; America's Fund.</p>

Full Mag: Veteran Stories Illustrated, Vol. 3 is bigger and better than ever... 10 stories, 88 pages,  magazine sized, perfect bound, printed in the USA in full color on 80# paper.   These amazing first-person stories, illustrated by the best graphic artists, can only be told by those who experienced the events themselves.  This volume includes the amazing veteran stories of:

Replacement at Inchon and rodeo rider-by James Aplan, art by Thomas Muzzell



What We Need & What You Get
The largest expenses, by far, for this unique veteran history project are the costs of paying artists and printing. 
We believe in paying artists competitive page rates and that is what we do.  For many reasons Full Mag must be printed in the USA and it is!  We believe in putting out the highest quality product and putting quality and care into every step of this process and that is what we do.  This volume represents untold thousands of hours of time from the veterans and our team.  You the customer and sponsor benefit from all of this. 
When you support our campaign and receive your copies of Full Mag, you are part of the team that obtains and presents the stories of these veterans while supporting the arts in a real way, by providing paying work to artists.  You receive the product of thousands of hours of work and the opportunity to read these amazing first-person accounts in a wonderfully engaging format.  This is unlike any other veteran history project. 

Gold Medal Review & Testimony from Veteran Participants
The feedback from veteran participants and/or their families is quite moving.  Here we share some of those quotes and from the Military Writers Society of America review of our most recent volume, which won the 2020 Gold Medal in the graphic novel category...  
FULL MAG is a terrific read, a terrific graphic novel, and a terrific tribute to the men and women of the armed forces. Strongly recommended. -- MWSA Review
The whole magazine is excellently done. I was so impressed by the art. The story is so well done. Thank you for a great job.  I can't wait till I can give them to my family. --  quote from Vietnam veteran storyteller
I also want to tell you how meaningful it was for my Dad to know that his stories would live on. What you are all doing is such important work.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.-- quote from daughter of WW II storyteller
Yesterday was the 75 Anniversary of Operation Market Garden.  They celebrate it still. Yesterday church bells ringing at 10:45: the hour the airborne forces left England: ceremonies and memorials all day long.  Today allied vets come for ceremony at Grave just north of St Hubert's.  I sent a copy of Full Mag... to.... She took your Full Mag to her class: this Anniversary they wrote essays on the subject: over here [America] none know about it unless you're a historian!!! -- quote from storyteller wife of WW II veteran.


A Great Opportunity
This campaign has a very low risk of non-fulfillment.  We have done this before and practice the philosophy of continuous improvement.  You will receive your product. 
The art and printing costs for this veteran history project are very high.  However, Full Mag also makes a great gift and it is important to share these veteran stories.  This combines to create an opportunity for sponsors.  We humbly ask that you pick up some extra copies.  Providing copies of Full Mag to your network shows folks that you are part of the team that is obtaining and presenting these stories so they are not lost.     


You are not alone!
Full Mag is also sponsored by First Spear, Magpul Industries, Hoplite Industries, Hamilton & Co. CPAs, and the Veterans Leadership Program.  Without these sponsors, we could not do this.  You will see their amazing ads in this volume. 
In addition, Full Magazine Publishing has also donated ad space to several organizations in this volume including: Warriors and Quiet Waters, the American Legion, the Montana Veterans Memorial, and the Semper Fi & America's Fund.",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Why</h3>
<p>Hey Knuckle Head,</p>
<p>D-String here and today I'd like to tell you a little bit about my life.  Since I was 6 years old my only goal was to be a writer. While all the other first graders were coloring, playing games, and making friends (three things I was not very good at) I was drawing and writing books.  On every front cover that I drew on torn out pieces of spiral notebook paper I would proudly write ""By: Daniel Ravenda"" in the bottom right corner. I knew back then that what I really wanted to be was a writer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Countless novel drafts, series, poems, and children's books later I have finally realized my dream of being a published author.  Back to Your Roots Is the first written work that I have ever seen come to print, so naturally It means a lot to me. Oh and ironically I forgot to tell the artist to put ""By: Daniel Ravenda"" in the bottom right corner.... Sorry six year old self, but hey at least we made it. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Ok great, I did it.  I wrote, published, and printed a written work.  Now what?  Well now comes the real hard part, making more.</p>
<p>Illustrating comics isn't cheap, and well for those of you who know me you know I have the artistic ability of an iguana... and iguana who's lost a hand.... Two hands.....  Anyway, I was very lucky to come across an artist Brook Waterwriter, who illustrated the entire comic, and commissioned her to bring my work to life.  WOW! As you can tell she did an amazing job, every page is exactly how Imagined it when writing the script. </p>
<p>I am setting a goal of $5000 to help me put out an entire series of GKM comic books, because as you'll see, I've only just begun telling this story.  Thats where you Knuckle Heads come in.  Every dollar you pledge to our campaign is another dollar towards making that 6 year old boy's dreams become a reality, and to show our appreciation we have come up with some fantastic perk packages for you!</p>

<p><b>Why Campbell?</b></p>
<p>Campbell is a city in Santa Clara County, California, and part of Silicon Valley, in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is a community that never experienced a pop culture convention. We want to change it and bring a convention to the city of Campbell for the community to enjoy and be proud of.  </p>
<p>It will be a one-day event celebrating pop culture in all its forms - from comic books to movies to games to toys to cosplay. It is going to be a day of fun for all ages - and right in the backyards for those living in Campbell. </p>
<p><b>What makes Campbell Con different? </b></p>
<p>Campbell Con is an experience that is pop culture with a touch of intimacy.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>This convention is something new to the arena of comic book/pop culture events in the fact that corporations have taken over the convention scene with such events as SDCC and New York Comic Con. The one thing these conventions miss in the throngs of celebrity and fans wanting to catch a glimpse of the latest thing in the industry is intimacy with the event. More and more we hear of fans disappointed in those corporate conventions stating that they get shuffled along to see their favorite convention guest like cattle. These conventions are more than happy to take your hard earned money, but leaves you unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Campbell Con is different because it offers intimacy with the guests who appear. There is no rushing you out of line or pushing a fan to the side. We cater for the fan, this convention is ran by fans for the fans.</p>
<p>This is why there is only a small limited exclusive number of tickets available so the fan can take their time being one on one with their favorite guests and artists at the convention. There is plenty of space and yet it will have all the fun of those so called conventions. It is time to bring back the conventions back to the fans, and Campbell Con is dedicated to that endeavor.</p>
<p>There is only a LIMITED number of fans who will be able to attend this incredible event that one must act now to cement their place, but once you're in you will have the time of your life conversing with guests, friends, and all those in attendance. Campbell Con is a convention where there is no strangers, just friends we haven't met yet.</p>
<p>Come and join us for fun and friendship in this amazing time for pop Culture.</p>
<p><b>What to do at Campbell Con?</b></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Campbell Con 2015 is a one-day pop culture convention in beautiful Campbell, CA.
Why Campbell?
Campbell is a city in Santa Clara County, California, and part of Silicon Valley, in the San Francisco Bay Area. It is a community that never experienced a pop culture convention. We want to change it and bring a convention to the city of Campbell for the community to enjoy and be proud of.  
It will be a one-day event celebrating pop culture in all its forms - from comic books to movies to games to toys to cosplay. It is going to be a day of fun for all ages - and right in the backyards for those living in Campbell. 
What makes Campbell Con different? 
Campbell Con is an experience that is pop culture with a touch of intimacy.

This convention is something new to the arena of comic book/pop culture events in the fact that corporations have taken over the convention scene with such events as SDCC and New York Comic Con. The one thing these conventions miss in the throngs of celebrity and fans wanting to catch a glimpse of the latest thing in the industry is intimacy with the event. More and more we hear of fans disappointed in those corporate conventions stating that they get shuffled along to see their favorite convention guest like cattle. These conventions are more than happy to take your hard earned money, but leaves you unfulfilled.
Campbell Con is different because it offers intimacy with the guests who appear. There is no rushing you out of line or pushing a fan to the side. We cater for the fan, this convention is ran by fans for the fans.
This is why there is only a small limited exclusive number of tickets available so the fan can take their time being one on one with their favorite guests and artists at the convention. There is plenty of space and yet it will have all the fun of those so called conventions. It is time to bring back the conventions back to the fans, and Campbell Con is dedicated to that endeavor.
There is only a LIMITED number of fans who will be able to attend this incredible event that one must act now to cement their place, but once you're in you will have the time of your life conversing with guests, friends, and all those in attendance. Campbell Con is a convention where there is no strangers, just friends we haven't met yet.
Come and join us for fun and friendship in this amazing time for pop Culture.
What to do at Campbell Con?

Our confirmed guests include Marvel & DC artist Chris Marrinan, writer and creator of the comic book ""CruZader - Agent of the Vatican"" Omar Morales, and actor starred in the films ""Friday The 13th Part 5"", ""Busted"", ""National Lampoon’s Last Resort"", writer, producer and radio host Dominick Brascia, and more to be announced.

<p>Godsend is a superhero/supernatural story that I created in 1994 and after many years, I have finally been able to put together a fantastic creative team to help make the Godsend comic book a reality.</p>
<p>Godsend follows the adventures of recent college graduate  Austin Jackson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets a strange man who leaves him with a powerful, ancient artifact known as the Blade of Power.</p>
<p>Now Austin must adjust to life in a new city and a new job all while trying to deal with the strange events that have been occurring since he came into possession of the sword.</p>
<p>Soon, Austin discovers that it is up to him to protect the Blade of Power from the Knights Templar and to protect humanity  from the unholy Swordsmen and their demon horde!</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the first six fully completed pages of Godsend #1 in the Gallery! </p>
<p>Godsend contains no gratuitous sex, foul language, or over the top violence/blood and guts. Godsend would be rated PG-13 if it were a movie and will contain action akin to superhero movies like Iron Man, Batman, or Captain America.</p>
<h2>Sharing Godsend's Story</h2>
<p>Being a comic book creator is a lot of fun, you can create anything that you can think of and the possibilities for stories are unlimited. Someone once said that being a comic book creator is like being a movie director with an unlimited budget because the things you can do with a comic book would cost many millions to do in a movie. </p>
<p>This is true, however, the second best part of creating a story is sharing it with others. It has been my dream, for a long time, to be able to share my stories with others. This is especially true with Godsend since it is the first character/story that I ever created. </p>
<p>Comic books excite me. The stories, the artwork, and how a well done comic book can draw you in and captivate you as well as any well written novel can.</p>
<p>Getting Godsend funded would be a dream come true. The thought of being able to share the adventures of Austin Jackson/Godsend  with readers around the world excites me! I have an amazing creative team working on Godsend and knowing that these books will be professionally done really makes me proud. It is my goal to not only make sure that these books look professional, but to make sure the story will entertain you and make you look forward to the next issue!</p>
<p>I have a lot of stories to tell with Godsend and with your generosity and help, I, along with the Godsend team, will be able to get the series off the ground and get Godsend's journey started.</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

<h1><strong>Why $3000?</strong></h1>
<p>The $3000 will strictly be used to pay the creative team, for advertising, printing, indiegogo incentives, and any other production costs of Godsend #1. We have a fantastic creative team working on Godsend, most of who are working for little or no up front pay. It's very important to me that they are paid for their fantastic work so, that hopefully, they will stick around for future issues of Godsend. Advertising is imperative for the success of Godsend. We have to be able to spread the word so that everyone will kinow about the Godsend comic book.</p>
<p>Up until this point, I have been funding the production cost of Godsend out of my own pocket. We have been able to get a lot accomplished but, it's a slow go since I just don't have a lot of extra money. If I can get Godsend funded, it will definitely expedite the process and we can get the book finished and into the readers hands a lot faster. Like with most independent comic book creators, money is the biggest hurdle we have to overcome. You can have the best project in the world but if you can't afford to produce the book in a quality manner, the world will never know. That is why it is so important to me that Godsend get funding.</p>
<p>If we should surpass our goal, that money would go strictly to production costs of Godsend #2.</p>
<h1>Shipping</h1>
<p>Shipping costs are included in your pledge. We do, however, ask that international backers add $5.00 to their pledge to help with shipping costs</p>
<h2> We Need Your Help</h2>
<p>We have accomplished a lot in the production of Godsend #1 but, we need your help to make the book a reality. Without Godsend #1, there will be no Godsend series. So, this is where it all starts.</p>
<p>With your financial assistance, we will be able to get Godsend finished quicker and, therefore, get it into the readers hands quicker.</p>
<p>We know money is tight for most people right now, so, if you can't make a pledge to our campaign but would still like to help out, here's what you can do.</p>
<p>You can visit our Godsend facebook page here <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/godsendcomic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/godsendcomic</a></p>

<p>Also, you can mention our campaign on any forums or blogs that you think would be beneficial to the project.</p>
<p>And, of course, tell everyone you know about Godsend and our campaign!</p>
<p>If money is the biggest hurdle that we indie comic book creators face, marketing is a close second. It doesn't matter how great a project is, if no one knows about, it will never succeed.</p>
<p>So, these things are huge and would most definitely be appreciated more than you will ever know!</p>

<p>For too long Hollywood and the entertainment industry have been only catering to one side of the aisle. Now it's time to even the score.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Introducing Agent Poso: TASK FORCE AEGIS</h3>
<p>Set ten years in the future a global threat has arisen, and the President must turn to those he can trust. An off-the-books team that works directly for him, in the shadows. For the most sensitive missions, he calls upon Agent Poso and TASK FORCE AEGIS</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Together with Agent Draino, Agent Tay, Agent Fairbanks and the help of the mysterious operative ALX, the Task Force takes on the NO FAIL missions that the President assigns Tier One.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agent Poso: TASK FORCE AEGIS issue #1 is a 32 page graphic novel and a high-energy rollercoaster of action, espionage, geopolitics and tongue-in-cheek political satire. It's an adventure everyone in the family can enjoy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Agent Poso: TASK FORCE AEGIS #1 has been made possible thanks to the exclusive pre-campaign sponsorship of the <a href=""https://americanpriority.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">American Priority Conference</a>. Attend AMPFEST2019 for a special AGENT POSO panel with Jack Posobiec and the Task Force.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Agent Poso Story</h3>
<p>The entertainment industry is in crisis. Hollywood and the streaming platforms are busy attacking American values, and the major comic book companies are no longer interested in telling great stories of high adventure — only of showcasing their own progressive politics.</p>
<p>Agent Poso sets out to reverse that trend by telling a real adventure story backed up with world class art and writing. We became sick of the Hollywood elites cramming their values into their products, and wanted to create a series about young conservatives that could be enjoyed from anyone from 2 to 92. After the success of Trump's Space Force, we approached Jack Posobiec about this spy thriller. In real life, Jack served as a US Navy intelligence officer, and now serves as a tireless conservative warrior in the fight against the Left. We are excited to work with Jack and others in the new conservative/MAGA movement to send a message to Hollywood that they don't own us or pop culture anymore. Help us build a successful franchise with Agent Poso and TASK FORCE AEGIS, the tip of the spear of a new wave of conservative counterculture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jack Posobiec has been part of the creative team since day one as co-creator along with comics industry vet and Creative Director Brett R. Smith.</li>
<li>AGENT POSO is written and illustrated by American comic book industry professionals, at the top of their field, and will be printed in America.</li>
<li>This project is our chance to prove the market for not only great adventure stories which entertain, but also stories with a conservative point of view.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Introducing TASK FORCE AEGIS</h3>
<p>TASK FORCE AEGIS exists to diffuse situations that are too politically sensitive for the CIA. AEGIS is a specialized group of professionals who remain hidden from the public eye. Although its network of specialists and operators is growing, we will introduce you to the key operatives found in issue #1.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Posobiec</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568490015/q6wr28yd960j2nemmvld.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Jack, or AGENT POSO as he is known by the team, leads Task Force AEGIS field operations. Jack is a master of disguises, stealth, espionage, and both armed and unarmed combat. He has the skill to blend in to any group to gather intel...except for one thing: cargo shorts.</p>
<p><strong>Tanya Tay Posobiec</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568490090/tb3vshgepmpj0sacmxsa.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>You don't seriously think Tanya would let Jack go into harm's way without her help, do you? Born in the USSR, and now a proud American, Tanya is an expert with languages, and a crack shot with a rifle. And she is more than capable of keeping the agents of Task Force AEGIS in line when they cause trouble... like using the fancy hand towels.</p>
<p><strong>Cassandra Fairbanks</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568490152/ytllgaollcjdcq6bkrte.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Cassandra is the Cyber-Ops specialist for Task Force AEGIS. She has been involved in cyber operations since the internet was created, and is always there to be the moral voice for the team or to let loose a little Puerto Rican attitude. Especially where animals are concerned. But don't expect any sympathy for clowns. </p>
<p><strong>DC Draino</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568490188/ewvqvtgxyw8dx7cuvl7v.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Agent Draino is Task Force AEGIS' special equipment and weapons expert. The cigar-chomping, country-music loving, truck-driving heavy. Sometimes in life you need a hammer, not a scalpel. And a well-maintained beard. </p>
<p> </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","For too long Hollywood and the entertainment industry have been only catering to one side of the aisle. Now it's time to even the score.  
 
Introducing Agent Poso: TASK FORCE AEGIS
Set ten years in the future a global threat has arisen, and the President must turn to those he can trust. An off-the-books team that works directly for him, in the shadows. For the most sensitive missions, he calls upon Agent Poso and TASK FORCE AEGIS
 
Together with Agent Draino, Agent Tay, Agent Fairbanks and the help of the mysterious operative ALX, the Task Force takes on the NO FAIL missions that the President assigns Tier One.
 
Agent Poso: TASK FORCE AEGIS issue #1 is a 32 page graphic novel and a high-energy rollercoaster of action, espionage, geopolitics and tongue-in-cheek political satire. It's an adventure everyone in the family can enjoy.
 
Agent Poso: TASK FORCE AEGIS #1 has been made possible thanks to the exclusive pre-campaign sponsorship of the American Priority Conference. Attend AMPFEST2019 for a special AGENT POSO panel with Jack Posobiec and the Task Force.
 



 
The Agent Poso Story
The entertainment industry is in crisis. Hollywood and the streaming platforms are busy attacking American values, and the major comic book companies are no longer interested in telling great stories of high adventure — only of showcasing their own progressive politics.
Agent Poso sets out to reverse that trend by telling a real adventure story backed up with world class art and writing. We became sick of the Hollywood elites cramming their values into their products, and wanted to create a series about young conservatives that could be enjoyed from anyone from 2 to 92. After the success of Trump's Space Force, we approached Jack Posobiec about this spy thriller. In real life, Jack served as a US Navy intelligence officer, and now serves as a tireless conservative warrior in the fight against the Left. We are excited to work with Jack and others in the new conservative/MAGA movement to send a message to Hollywood that they don't own us or pop culture anymore. Help us build a successful franchise with Agent Poso and TASK FORCE AEGIS, the tip of the spear of a new wave of conservative counterculture.

Jack Posobiec has been part of the creative team since day one as co-creator along with comics industry vet and Creative Director Brett R. Smith.
AGENT POSO is written and illustrated by American comic book industry professionals, at the top of their field, and will be printed in America.
This project is our chance to prove the market for not only great adventure stories which entertain, but also stories with a conservative point of view.

 
Introducing TASK FORCE AEGIS
TASK FORCE AEGIS exists to diffuse situations that are too politically sensitive for the CIA. AEGIS is a specialized group of professionals who remain hidden from the public eye. Although its network of specialists and operators is growing, we will introduce you to the key operatives found in issue #1.
Jack Posobiec

Jack, or AGENT POSO as he is known by the team, leads Task Force AEGIS field operations. Jack is a master of disguises, stealth, espionage, and both armed and unarmed combat. He has the skill to blend in to any group to gather intel...except for one thing: cargo shorts.
Tanya Tay Posobiec

You don't seriously think Tanya would let Jack go into harm's way without her help, do you? Born in the USSR, and now a proud American, Tanya is an expert with languages, and a crack shot with a rifle. And she is more than capable of keeping the agents of Task Force AEGIS in line when they cause trouble... like using the fancy hand towels.
Cassandra Fairbanks

Cassandra is the Cyber-Ops specialist for Task Force AEGIS. She has been involved in cyber operations since the internet was created, and is always there to be the moral voice for the team or to let loose a little Puerto Rican attitude. Especially where animals are concerned. But don't expect any sympathy for clowns. 
DC Draino

Agent Draino is Task Force AEGIS' special equipment and weapons expert. The cigar-chomping, country-music loving, truck-driving heavy. Sometimes in life you need a hammer, not a scalpel. And a well-maintained beard.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>""The King's Demon"" is a light fantasy short story by myself, Jess Ange. It focuses on a female knight who has dedicated her life to the kingdom, but now finds her loyalty compromised by evidence that shows the kingdom is corrupted. The King's Demon Project is both a personal and school project that will result in two book versions that will be printed and then hand bound by me. This campaign will fund the creation of editions, or copies, of the books, and to also introduce ""The King's Demon"" to an audience.</p>
<h3><strong>What IS The King's Demon Project?</strong></h3>
<p>""The King's Demon"" (now referred to as KD) is a short story I wrote a couple of years ago. It is very close to me, so I've attempted a couple of times to bring it out to the world in a visual format. Why did I fail those times? Well, because I sucked at drawing comics. Drawing comics is hard! If you ever meet a comic artist, give them a hug or a bro fist.</p>
<p>That said, KD has had plenty of time to stew in my brain. I swore to myself that I'll make it see the light of day again. That opportunity arose when I signed up for an independent study course at school. I essentially get to create my own assignments for credit. Being a design major and an amateur bookbinder, I wanted to marry the two, but what to do for content? Then I thought, ""Hey dummy, you DO have content for a book sitting around!"" And so I brushed the dust off of KD and pitched the assignment to my professor, which as you can see, was given the green light.</p>
<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p>Despite all odds, Leona Wilds is the king's best knight. Not only does her status as knight bewilder many, she also came from a recently annexed province, making her dark features and height stand out amongst the fair people of Correxia. When Leona is sent on a mission to recover the kidnapped first prince, she walks into a trap and is forced to question her ideals...and the very kingdom she serves.</p>
<p>You can follow <a href=""http://kingsdemon.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The King's Demon blog</a> on Tumblr for more work in progress shots and process images!</p>

<p>Above: A sample spread without the story text on it.</p>
<h3><strong>One Story, Two Experiences</strong></h3>
<p>I will be making two books. One is the <strong>Text Version</strong>. It'll be just that, a small book with just the written story in it. It will be a small book sewn together with a paper cover; it will effectively been the highest quality paperback book you've probably ever seen! The point of this book is to focus on typography layout, as an exercise of laying out content in a publication. There aren't any pictures, but this is the story in it's original format, which is different from the other version. The second book is the <strong>Graphic Novel Version</strong>. I say graphic novel, but in reality, this won't be a normal, straight-up comic. I'll be experimenting with sequential art, with fewer panel grids and more of a, well, ""artsy"" feel. This version will be a bigger book, printed in full color, and case bound with hard covers.</p>
<p>In the event that someone grabs the New King Award, I'll be making a special third book that includes both versions of the story, concept work, and the original drafts of the story.</p>

<h3><strong>The Obstacles</strong></h3>
<p>There are two major obstacles in front of me, that I'm sure everyone is familiar with: time and money.</p>
<p>I'm a full-time student, I have a part-time job on the weekends, I am the promotions person for my school's art club, and I am half of an art studio I run with a friend. Needless to say, I'll be managing my time carefully and doing my best to not procrastinate or be lazy, regardless of how badly I want to watch Sailor Moon or read The Lord of the Rings. As the project goes on, I'll be updating with a to-do list/calendar to stay on task. Keeping my actions within view of the public will also keep me in line!</p>
<p>When my professor mentioned the idea of making editions — or copies — of KD, I said sure...but paying for printing is beastly! The Text Version will be printed on my studio printer, but the Graphic Novel Version will need to be printed at a store depending on how many of that version I'll be making. Even then, there's the cost of book board, paper, ink, and the intangible cost of time. My first solution to this problem is this campaign. How many editions of these books I make is dependent on how much money I can raise. It will truly be a test of my skills in marketing a product, by seeing if anyone would even want this or not!</p>
<h3>Just the Start</h3>
<p>KD has the potential of a continuation. My goal is to get these books in the hands of you, so that you can help <em>me</em> continue Leona's story. This initial print run will be a stepping stone along the project's path; first, a few books, then more to be sold at conventions, and then a continuation. So please, even if fantasy isn't your thing, share the project! Sir Leona appreciates your tweets and efforts.</p></div>","""The King's Demon"" is a light fantasy short story by myself, Jess Ange. It focuses on a female knight who has dedicated her life to the kingdom, but now finds her loyalty compromised by evidence that shows the kingdom is corrupted. The King's Demon Project is both a personal and school project that will result in two book versions that will be printed and then hand bound by me. This campaign will fund the creation of editions, or copies, of the books, and to also introduce ""The King's Demon"" to an audience.
What IS The King's Demon Project?
""The King's Demon"" (now referred to as KD) is a short story I wrote a couple of years ago. It is very close to me, so I've attempted a couple of times to bring it out to the world in a visual format. Why did I fail those times? Well, because I sucked at drawing comics. Drawing comics is hard! If you ever meet a comic artist, give them a hug or a bro fist.
That said, KD has had plenty of time to stew in my brain. I swore to myself that I'll make it see the light of day again. That opportunity arose when I signed up for an independent study course at school. I essentially get to create my own assignments for credit. Being a design major and an amateur bookbinder, I wanted to marry the two, but what to do for content? Then I thought, ""Hey dummy, you DO have content for a book sitting around!"" And so I brushed the dust off of KD and pitched the assignment to my professor, which as you can see, was given the green light.
The Story
Despite all odds, Leona Wilds is the king's best knight. Not only does her status as knight bewilder many, she also came from a recently annexed province, making her dark features and height stand out amongst the fair people of Correxia. When Leona is sent on a mission to recover the kidnapped first prince, she walks into a trap and is forced to question her ideals...and the very kingdom she serves.
You can follow The King's Demon blog on Tumblr for more work in progress shots and process images!

Above: A sample spread without the story text on it.
One Story, Two Experiences
I will be making two books. One is the Text Version. It'll be just that, a small book with just the written story in it. It will be a small book sewn together with a paper cover; it will effectively been the highest quality paperback book you've probably ever seen! The point of this book is to focus on typography layout, as an exercise of laying out content in a publication. There aren't any pictures, but this is the story in it's original format, which is different from the other version. The second book is the Graphic Novel Version. I say graphic novel, but in reality, this won't be a normal, straight-up comic. I'll be experimenting with sequential art, with fewer panel grids and more of a, well, ""artsy"" feel. This version will be a bigger book, printed in full color, and case bound with hard covers.
In the event that someone grabs the New King Award, I'll be making a special third book that includes both versions of the story, concept work, and the original drafts of the story.

<p>Because we don't need that much!

Our most valuable asset is time--we haven't had much due to demanding work and school. This summer is a window of opportunity to get this done.</p>
<p>Also, the colorist's wacom is about to go kaput. We decided it was best if we take preorders/donations to help make this happen.</p>
<p>Indiegogo also imposes a minimum of $500, which we didn't like, but since they deliver funds to us directly, it's alright if we don't reach the full $500. We do need to at least reach $350 though.</p>
<p>So while other people may ask for thousands of dollars.. we aren't going to, because it simply isn't necessary (no offense to anyone else's campaign). We only need just a smidge to help us get started.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Luca an Italian illustrator, tattoo artist and concept artist. Some months ago I launched my first crowdfunding campaign to produce this sketchbook, and it was successful. I printed the books and they went sold out early. Some people asked me for a copy and then I decided to re-propose the book again, this time for Indiegogo users.</p>
<p>This book is a collection of many drawings made by me in the last few years: sketches, studies, preliminary pencils and final b/w and color pieces, most of them representing amazing creatures both from my imagination and from the classical canons of fantasy.</p>

<p>Many b/w drawings (preliminary works for full color illustrations) from my publications with Paizo (Pathfinder) are also included in this book.</p>

This book is a collection of many drawings made by me in the last few years: sketches, studies, preliminary pencils and final b/w and color pieces, most of them representing amazing creatures both from my imagination and from the classical canons of fantasy.

Many b/w drawings (preliminary works for full color illustrations) from my publications with Paizo (Pathfinder) are also included in this book.
There are also some superheroes fan-art and commissions, preliminary studies I've made for my old comic projects, and step by step character and creature designs.

What you can get is the PDF of the book, the paperback book that you can see in the pictures (120 pages, color print and signed by the author) with or without an original pencil drawing inside. 
Risks & Challenges
I've already printed this book, so I have the definitive ready-to-print files and a trustworthy typography, so it is very unlikely to be late.

<h2>Kicking Butt In High Heels</h2>
<p>My name's Emily, and I'm 16. I'm among the hundreds of thousands of people who are upset by the lack of female superheroes in comics and graphic novels. There's Superman, Batman, Spiderman - where are the women? Where are our cool role models who kick butt? </p>
<p>Kicking Butt In High Heels is a series of graphic novels that will have multiple superheroes of different races, so every girl can find someone to look up to.</p>
<p>Everyone who works on Kicking Butt In High Heels will be female, from the artists to the writers to me to the people who print it.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for $50,000. Most of that will be going to paying artists and writers, and the rest will be going to publishing costs. If we don't reach our goal, we'll do our best to meet it with what we have.</p>
<p>As to what you get - we have some pretty cool perks, including t-shirts, signed panels from the graphic novel, signed copies of the graphic novel, and copies of the graphic novel itself.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is going to be valuable to a lot of females everywhere. Think of how amazing it would've been to, as a child, read a book about a female superhero who kicks butt! I think it'll have an amazing impact on females all over.</p>
<p>There's no reason all the superheroes need to be male - us females are just as powerful. It's time to prove it to the world by making this a reality.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Obviously, there are risks and challenges involved. I have two published books, though, based on my viral Tumblr projects (Dear My Blank and The Last Message Received) which both have art accompaniment, so I feel I'm pretty qualified to handle them. We'll be as transparent as possible about everything.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate (or even if you can and you really think we're a cool campaign) tell your friends about the campaign!</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>My name is Jeff Duvall. Ever since I was in elementary school, I've always dreamed of creating comics. I always found the idea of creating my own world and having people fall in love with it as a fascinating thing. Over the years, I've sold comics at different conventions such as Otakon, Awesome Con, and Baltimore Comic Con. I took a hiatus to grow my skill so I could provide better quality work. Now, I'm more confident in my ability and want to bring a better story to you all.</p>

<h3>Who Am I??</h3>
<p>I am Tony Kittrell.  I am a Firefighter/Paramedic, a husband, a father and a grandfather.  I am also a comic book fan for 40 plus years and it was that love that made me want to create my own comics.</p>
<p>With over ten years of experience as a Creator, Editor, Writer and Publisher in the Indie Comics field, I have brought close to fifty comic titles to the industry.  But I have failed at getting a completed Indiegogo campaign...so far.   While I haven’t had a successful Indiegogo campaign yet, I have had eight successful Kickstarter campaigns that shared my creations with the world and more importantly were completed as promised.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>COSMOS is a twelve issue maxi-series that serves as an introduction to my comic book universe and is without a doubt my biggest project ever!  </p>
<p>In the 32 page COSMOS #1, a routine U.S. Space Mission to the moon sees an alien invasion force from another galaxy come to Earth.  Also, the cosmic powers of this universe (known as The Universals) convene as a cosmic threat approaches.  A mysterious hero, Genesis, appears on a planet without any memory of who he is and is met by the cosmic being Enigma the Soultaker.  This begins a journey that will reveal the secret history of the universe but also serve as the catalyst which will either save or destroy all creation!</p>
<p>Not only is this maxi-series bringing together all of my cosmic heroes in one book, it also doubles as the biggest Indie Comics crossover in comics history.  Over 75 Indie Comics Creators &amp; Publishers have come onboard this series to make it truly amazing!  You are in store for several BIG surprises!!</p>
<p>By supporting my campaign, you will be allowing me to introduce new readers to my comics universe, other indiecomics publishers and to hopefully create more great books that will entertain and thrill you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am trying to bring awareness of my comics to everyone who likes comics with good stories, great art and cool &amp; fun characters.  I am only asking for a minimum funding goal since the book is completed and I am trying to introduce my comics to a new audience of as many people as possible.  All funds raised will be going towards printing the book, shipping to backers and to pay for the rewards.</p>
<p>We are offering an awesome new comic series plus some pretty cool rewards.  By becoming a backer, you can receive exclusive trading cards and prints, have you or your character added to the story and more. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you will be introducing yourself to a wild and fantastic comic book universe that is celebrating a decade of great comics as well as supporting the Indie Comic movement itself.  It will personally benefit the team and I because we get to share our book by bringing this series which is a labor of love to the world of Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Also, if this campaign is successful, COSMOS #2 will launch here on Indiegogo in January 2020.</p>

There's a huge rogue gallery of diverse space villainy, an array of conscious planets, or bizarre deep space anomalies. The Danger-Squad will take us on a fantastic journey few have seen. 
What's in the Book?
The content and packaging of the book is as follows: This is the first Danger-Squad graphic novel, which would be the origin story. It would be 50 pages of colorful high quality paper. The hardcover measures at 8.5"" x 12.5"" and features the Danger-Squad origin story followed by vivid splash pages.  Looking to have guest artists also contribute to these splash pages with their own creative visual interpretations.
The Budget and Costs
The budget of this comic book includes the collaboration with a colorist, an inker, and letterer. I'm creating 300 copies of this story to share with readers far and wide. I'm looking to invest an amount on the marketing and promotion to put out there for the public consumption and awareness. (Comic-Con, post cards, and travel to various art related events).
These Stories Are A Life Dream 
I'm the creator, writer, and the artist of this story. All these years have prepared me for a special opportunity like this. It's all coming together full circle now. I want this project to represent my passion, respect, and appreciation for the comic book, and science-fiction medium. 
With your support, I can complete, publish, market and distribute my first major comic. I want to make this a quality work, which represents my passion, respect, and appreciation for the comic book, and science-fiction medium. I would be sincerely grateful for any amount you can contribute to this dream!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm FifthDream. If you've found this page, you probably already know me. I'm an aspiring artist. I dabble in my spare time with painting, and comic book art. I've been drawing almost all of my life, and have been reading comics and manga for a little less time than that. I've always wanted to make comics, and have a lot of ideas, if not quite the skills to do it on my own. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recently, a popular manga-creation program called Comipo! ( <a href=""http://www.comipo.com/en/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.comipo.com/en/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.comipo.com/en/index.html</a> ) was released in English. The software allows users to create 3-d characters and pose and place them into comic panel templates, helping to simplify the process of producing manga. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At this point in my life, I'm unfortunately struggling financially, and even the modest cost of this software is beyond my reach. But I've always loved the idea of the program, and am eager to be able to use it to practice with, and eventually begin creation of a manga that's been an idea kicking around in my head for years. The characters and story are amusing to me, and I think others would feel the same way. I do believe my own skills as an artist may be a bit limited to produce this manga on my own. but with Comipo!, I think i'd have a good headstart getting this idea out of my head, and onto virtual paper!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So donate to my modest campaign, and help my ideas come to 2-d sequential-panelled life!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><font color=""#993333"">(NOTE: THE PROJECT GOAL IS STATED AS $500. THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A MINIMUM GOAL SET BY THIS SITE. I AM ONLY TRYING TO RAISE $60. I WILL STILL RECEIVE DONATIONS MADE THAT DO NOT MEET THIS IMPOSED MINIMUM GOAL.)<br/></font> </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'd love to be able to bring my idea idea to life, so that others can enjoy it as much as I do. While I think I'm a decent artist, I'm not sure I I have the skills to produce an ongoing manga without some help.  With this software, I'd have a huge headstart. (And not only with this specfic idea, but with other, random smaller comic ideas that come to me from time to time.) I'd love to be able to start producing this comic and publish it on the web. It might not happen immediately, but having Comipo! to practice with would be a great beginning. Your donation will help produce my vision and publish it for others to see. Don't let what I think is a cool, funny story idea stay hidden from the world forever. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is where you come in. I'd like to raise the funds to purchase theComipo! software (just $49.95 US), and cover the fees for my campaign (roughly 7-10% for the host site, and 3% Paypal fees, a total of $60 US).<font color=""#cc3333""> </font><font color=""#993333"">(I REALIZE THE GOAL IS STATED AS $500. THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS A MINIMUM GOAL SET BY THIS SITE. I AM ONLY TRYING TO RAISE $60. I WILL STILL RECEIVE DONATIONS MADE THAT DO NOT MEET THIS IMPOSED MINIMUM GOAL.) </font>Rewards for donation will include updates on progress with practicing the use of the software, links to future projects created with the software, and higher-end donators will receive custom manga and/or characters appearing in manga. Also, all donators will get some secret information on what the manga will be. Awesome, no? The cost is really low, so any donation will bring the goal much closer to becoming a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If I'm unable to raise the full amount, what I do raise will be saved and used for purchasing the program when further funds are avalaible (maybe through another campaign!). Regardless, when the program is purchased, rewards will be provided, maybe just a little later. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Promotion would definitely help. Are you part of a community where others may be interested in my project? Let them know! Spread the word! Any help with my campaign is appreciated more than you can know. </p>

 be a little stressful for the editor (yours truly).  We have already

the first time that we have worked with this printer so hopefully they 
will be able to turn out a quality product for us.<br/><br/>Also, we don't have as many perks this year as last year so it we are going to emphasize volume of perks rather than a handful of big ticket items.<br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>

Library Comic Con on Saturday August 29th where the anthology will make 
its debut.  If there is any extra money left over, that cash will go to 
the Friends of the Boise Public Library.   The Impact You will be able to own a piece of Idaho sequential arts history and help out a great cause at the same time.Risks & Challenges

 We're waiting on a couple of creators pieces so making the deadline will
 be a little stressful for the editor (yours truly).  We have already 
obtained the Tarzan license so that won't be a problem.  Also, this is 
the first time that we have worked with this printer so hopefully they 
will be able to turn out a quality product for us.Also, we don't have as many perks this year as last year so it we are going to emphasize volume of perks rather than a handful of big ticket items.   Other Ways You Can Help 
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: 
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.
Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!

 That's about it.  Thanks in advance for your help.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>The comic will be updated twice a month, with a total of thirty full length issues after all is said and done, with ten issues for each season. With your help, we can not only promise more frequent updates to the comic, but we'll also be able to make it worlds better.</p>

All civilizations come from it and all existing parallel dimensions will converge to it. Lumina is the planet of light and creation, the kingdom of Fej Farok.<br/><br/>The Fej Farok is a parasite and a deity, which can cross the membrane that separates the parallel universes, adjusting their balance if needed. It’s a creature made up of two parts – Fej and Farok – and each of them is hosted by two bodies, two porters, elected among the descendants of the Abyssals, very intelligent and ancient creatures that form the spiritual and religious side of Lumina. When the Fej Farok picks two individuals, the chosen ones, it literally owns their bodies and gives them unimaginable power. They become Fej (Yin), and Farok (Yang).<br/>The dawn of time and Fej Farok ruled the planet Lumina .<br/>However, the ambition and the thirst for conquest of Fej were great : he wished to conquer all the planets in the Universe, in all possible realities , using their immense powers . To achieve his goal , he needed his half Farok , which, however , did not share the destructive plans and conquerors of the counterparty.<br/>Fej so he decided to kill Farok . A few moments before being struck by the sword of Fej , Farok could be projected on a planet , of all possible worlds , in a time among all possible times . In just a few seconds to choose two innocent creatures and give them his share of the parasite and its powers . On that planet , the Earth, in the present, Fej would not be able to find the completion of his power to achieve his evil purposes.<br/>Earth. Today.<br/>Miriam and Kite are two lively kids, as many of their age, divinding their time between school and friends. They’re orphans. Miriam looks after her little brother, who’s not really the easy kind, though. Miriam is a very nice young girl and careful sister but at times she can be a little bit too much harsh with herself and the people around her. Kite is a real force of nature, lazy at school and on the everyday tasks and a real daredevil on the streets while practicing his favorite hobby, the Parkour: he’s a young, flamboyant energy mix.<br/>For some time now, the two have been sharing a strange hallucination: they were both still, hand in hand, in a kind of a mesmerized state, staring at a strange geometric flame containing an immense, very brightly lit opening in its very center. Kite and Miriam have never given too much weight to these visions, till one day, at school, they got suddenly surrounded by very menacing mysterious Black Creatures. Frightened to the bones, they tried to run away, but they soon found themselves in the strange place they’d seen in their common visions.<br/>They got pushed inside the flame and from that moment on their life would’ve never been the same.<br/>When they wake up, Miriam and Kite are right in the midst of a bloody battle between the Black Creatures and a powerful warrior. Above their heads a giant sprawling body materializes and grows exponentially, destroying everything around him. Behind them, a strange man in a hood speaking an incomprehensible strange language, is repeating a magical chant that sounds like an ancient rite.<br/>In no time, the two kids got parted. As is Miriam taken by a Black Creature, Kite stays on the scene, firmly clinging to the strong arm of the warrior. The gigantic creature has disappeared. Now Kite is alone, confused but very determined to find his sister. He will face a long and tough journey, alongside with and fighting against extraordinary creatures. His goal is to find Miriam and get out of that vast and dazzling planet Lumina, as the fearsome warrior Oleg and the abysmal Nohe call it.<br/><br/><p></p><h2><b></b></h2><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/504722/files/20140413061126-lumina-slide-03.jpg?1397394686"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>REWARDS </b></h2><p></p><ol>

Lùmina is a bright, colorful italian graphic novel project by Emanuele Tenderini and Linda Cavallini, authors of many titles previously published by names such as Sergio Bonelli, Delcourt, Ankama, Mondadori, Hachette, Les Humanoïdes associés, DeAgostini, Panini.The book's genre is in between sci-fi and fantasy, mainly inspired by Miyazaki, who you'll certainly recognize in the vast landscapes and open spaces. Wonderful creatures and charismatic characters will be involved in one of the most amazing adventures ever told in a graphic novel.The plot unveils around the story of two children, Kite and Miriam, brother and sister, who find themselves thrown in a parallel world called Lùmina.This will be one of the first comic books in the world to be coloured with the hyperflat technique (link) and printed using hexachrome, a six-color printing process (link).                                            We decided to bring this project to life through the crowdfunding community, as we believe that the straight connection between the authors and the readers is the strongest factor during the publishing process.Plus, we are sure that the only way the comics world can be brought to a higher level is through the support of its ultimate investors - the readers.The storyThe planet, Fej Farok, brother and sister Miriam e KiteLumina is the whole Universe’s oldest planet.

Frightened to the bones, they tried to run away, but they soon found themselves in the strange place they’d seen in their common visions.They got pushed inside the flame and from that moment on their life would’ve never been the same.When they wake up, Miriam and Kite are right in the midst of a bloody battle between the Black Creatures and a powerful warrior. Above their heads a giant sprawling body materializes and grows exponentially, destroying everything around him. Behind them, a strange man in a hood speaking an incomprehensible strange language, is repeating a magical chant that sounds like an ancient rite.In no time, the two kids got parted. As is Miriam taken by a Black Creature, Kite stays on the scene, firmly clinging to the strong arm of the warrior. The gigantic creature has disappeared. Now Kite is alone, confused but very determined to find his sister. He will face a long and tough journey, alongside with and fighting against extraordinary creatures. His goal is to find Miriam and get out of that vast and dazzling planet Lumina, as the fearsome warrior Oleg and the abysmal Nohe call it.REWARDS

<h2 dir=""ltr"">--Project Description--</h2>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">I'm just 30 pages shy of completing <em>Dream Life | a late coming of age.</em>
</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Douglas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Max Douglas</a>, I'm a cartoonist, working under the pen name <a href=""http://www.salgoodsam.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Salgood Sam</a>, and with your help I’d like to get the first half of the longest story I've ever tried to tell completed in time for <a href=""http://torontocomics.com/news/tcaf-2013-may-11th-and-12th/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TCAF 2013</a>.</p>
<p>I'm very close already, <a href=""http://dl.salgoodsam.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">over 115 pages are done</a>, just a mere thirty left to complete the first three chapters. I hope with this campaign I can dedicate the rest of this year to making those thirty pages my primary focus.</p>
<p>This story is a labour of love. A work of fiction with fantastic and adventure elements. It borrows from my own life--as close to autobiography as I've dared in many ways. The cast is an amalgam of people I've known and myself, played off archetypes. The situations and conflicts borrow from my own experiences and stories I've been close to.</p>
<p>Charlie's childhood friend is about to die.<br/>Hitch hiking in BC PJ's luck runs out.<br/>Lionel is in existential free-fall.<br/>Leslie is a therapist and part time drug dealer.<br/>It's just occurring to her she hates her job.<br/>Dan's daughter thinks he needs to grow up.<br/>-<br/>The story of five friends.<br/>Dreams, drugs, &amp; denial<br/>all failing to weather<br/>the arc of life unscathed.<br/>Each coming to terms with lives peter panned,<br/>and in danger of going off the rails.</p>

<p>I've worked both <a href=""http://www.salgoodsam.com/comics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">commercially and independently</a> for others most of the 20+ years that I've been a cartoonist. I've been lucky to often make my living doing that but there are always trade-offs and limits to the work.</p>
<p><strong>With <em>Dream Life</em> I'm trying to do all the things i've always wanted to, tell a story that I'd want to read--without compromise or conditions.</strong></p>
<p>I've been very lucky <a href=""http://www.canadacouncil.ca/writing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">to receive grant funding</a> for <em>Dream Life</em> in the past. That had been a huge help getting this far. But life throws us unforeseen curves: In early 2011, <a href=""http://www.salgoodsam.com/2011/03/25/my-little-friend/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">I was diagnosed with testicular cancer</a>, and had an operation to remove it. I got lucky, hopefully will stay lucky. But I did lose a lot of time to that, dealing with the stress, distractions, and recovering from the operation.</p>
<p>And just as I was getting back to feeling normal, I got slammed by a bacterial infection in my stomach in the fall, lost fifteen pounds in two weeks, and a couple months due to being laid out and exhausted by that. So while the grant made getting as far as I have possible, and recovering a lot less stressful, I did not get as far as I had wanted to. So close though. So so close.</p>
<p>So it goes. I'm grateful and I'll keep at it one way or another, but the grant funds are gone now. Working as a freelancer takes up most of my time. Between finding the next job and doing the jobs, I’m left with little space to squeak out pages.</p>
<p>So I thought I’d try crowdfunding to make room to wrap up this first half of the book and put a small run of 100 B&amp;W first editions in time for TCAF 2013. To do that I need to finance 3 months of focused work on this and this alone. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.salgoodsam.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/calanderX.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""last three months of 2012 is all i think it should take.""/></p>
<p>I also plan to upload the book to <a href=""https://www.createspace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Create Space</a> [Amazon] so it will be available to all right away, either in print or digitally via their app market.<br class=""""/><br class=""""/>On my own I’ll get there one day but probably not in time for TCAF, and I have other obligations in 2013 that will probably cause even more delays. So now’s the time to make this happen.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">What I Need &amp; What You Get<br/>[<em>update: i've added printed edtions care of Create Space for some!</em>]</h3>
<p><strong>The minimum to ensure this all happens is I think, $3500</strong>.</p>
<p>I've set the goal here at $3800 because of the site fees. If we reach $3800, what I'll get is just a bit over $3500. If we fall short the fees are a bit higher [4% if we match the goal, 9% if we fall short].</p>
<p>If we can surpass the goal, the surplus initially will go into better printing and/or a larger run for the first edition, and a bit more time/peace of mind.</p>
<p>If it looks like we're really going to knock it out of the park I'll think of some new worthy expanded goals, and perks. More art and reserved copies of the first edition are the first likely candidates.</p>
<p>For now I want to keep the bar low, so $3000 to cover living expenses while I do the work, and $500 to go mostly towards perks, maybe a bit left over for printing the first editions.<br/><br class=""""/>The smallest support option is <strong>$5</strong>, with the perk of getting a digital edition [<em>PDF or CBR, specify your preference when you dontate</em>] of <em>Dream Life | a late coming of age</em>, book one. Like all supporters will get your name listed on the thank you page in the book and on my site unless you request otherwise. This option is essentially a pre-order of the digital edtion which will be sold for about that give or take a cent. I'm considering also making a set of 5 ¢99 versions available too but either way, $5. But by supporting now you will be the first to get Dream life, even before the early print editons are mailed out you'll be able to download your digital copy!</p>
<p><strong>Updated:</strong> Folks who took 15 dollar personal digital edition will still get it but i removed it in the list to make room for new options. Personalized editions can still be had via the ""get's personal"" perks offered: <del>For the supporters backing with <strong>$15</strong> or more, their digital editions will be personalized, with a scanned handwritten signature, note, and sketch inside the “front page”. This will be unique to the funding drive.</del></p>
<p>The physical copy of signature pages will be mailed to you via regular letter post [no express or registered mail]. I'll be sending you an adhesive bookplate too if you're getting a copy of the book now.</p>
<p>Starting at <strong>$25 </strong>us, <strong>$35</strong> for canadian and international backers [<em>postage fees inc</em>], by having supported the project you will receive the Limited Early Edition of the book, with 10 pages of extended content. A preview of book two, art, and other goodies.</p>
<p>You will again be among the first to see it, receiving your copies in March. Before the formal launch in May 2013! Your early editions will be identifiably marked as a result of having contributed Distinguished inside and out from the Launch editions. I'm thinking i'll draw a special back cover and spine for them both. The run will be limited to supporters who back the book before the funding drive ends October 15th 2012.</p>
<p>For <strong>$35 </strong>us,<strong> $ 45 </strong>for canadian and international backers [<em>postage fees inc</em>],<strong> </strong>you get A personalized digital copy, a copy of the singed page with sketch, and the Limited Early Edition of Dream life | a late coming of age. The signature page will be done on paper the right size to fit in your physical copy. I'm including an Adhesive bookplate designed for the Limited Early Edition too now. I'll be happy to do so again in person someday too if I happen to meet you. And shake your hand too! I might get emotional. :D</p>
<p><strong>All Sociaty6 prints and the digital library of my independat work  have been removed as options. </strong>Not to worry, those who got them will be honoured of course! And if you miss the prints, you can always go for small donation here and get something from the <a href=""http://society6.com/SalgoodSam"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shop</a>!</p>
<p>For <strong>$100</strong>, along with all of that. you will get a bit part as an extra for one or more panels in <em>Dream Life</em>. 6 of these have been taken, expect to see cartoonists in this. :)</p>
<p>I'll send you a print of your cameo page along with the signature page in the mail.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>$200</strong> will get you either a piece of original art from <em>Dream Life</em>, or a private commision. Anything you like within reason [I won’t draw something I find offensive or otherwise objectionable]. This perk also comes with the printed book, and the digital catalog including personalized <em>Dream Life-book one</em>.</p>
<p><em>I've been tweaking the perks. Have a look and see what fits you!</em></p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">What will be the Impact?</h3>
<p>Well put simply, you will make my day, life, etc. It's really frustrating to be so close to being done this chunk of the book, and have to work on it in dribs and drabs.</p>
<p>I want <em>Dream Life</em> to be my BEST work. So, having the freedom to dedicate my energy to it alone for any amount of time will be awesome.</p>
<p>I can't promise you this book will change the world or solve poverty, but it will change my life; getting as far as I have already has, as it's already been noticed and got me nominated for an award last year as a web comic. Completing it and being able to present it in time for TCAF next year will mean the accomplishment of a major life and career goal. And for what it’s worth, I do think work that aspires to the standards and richness I hope to bring to <em>Dream Life</em>, enriches our world over all. Stories that have heart and integrity and try to make us think while being entertaining and beautiful.</p>
<p>With your help that's what I hope to bring forth.</p>
<h3 dir=""ltr"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I've made it easy to pitch in even a little, but if you're really unable to support <em>Dream Life</em> financially, you can always help by telling as many other people as you can about this funding drive, and <em>Dream Life</em> generally. Use the Indiegogo social sharing tools, ‘like’ <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/DreamLifeALateComingOfAge"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the fan page on Facebook</a>, and share this link to the first 100+ pages online, on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.347547195323844.77452.347543618657535&amp;type=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/112302328634546793979/albums/5628569453039009185"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Google+</a>, or <a href=""http://dl.salgoodsam.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the webcomic page here</a>, free to read.</p>

<h1>Expanding on plans, publishing wise.</h1>
<h3>I’ve just met my main goal for a crowd funding campaign to finance completing  Dream Life: a late coming of age!</h3>
<p><strong>So with a little over a week left in this funding drive, I’m going to go forward with a modified version of my second-tier goal and put up a set of retailer options!</strong></p>
<p>There are variables that have to be entered manually, make sure you read carfully before entering, and please do <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=salgood%5BAT%5Dgmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">contact me too</a>. It would be nice for the exchange to be more personal and we can confirm the package you opted for.</p>
<p>You also have the option of doing this less publicly, via emal and other payment options, we don’t have to use Indiegogo for this.</p>
<p>To have a look at the contents of the book, I’ve created <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXd-M34_NRw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a trailer on youtube</a>, and feel free to read through the 100+ pages <a href=""http://dl.salgoodsam.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, or <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.347547195323844.77452.347543618657535&amp;type=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, or <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/112302328634546793979/albums/5628569453039009185"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>, or via <a href=""http://dl.salgoodsam.com/pdf/DL1st105BnW150dpi.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this PDF file</a>.  The web versions has some colour pages, something I was playing with but don’t have time to complete that way in the foreseeable future. <br/><br/>For now the book is to be black and white like the PDF. The Launch edition will be <strong>150 pages, colour cover, 6”x9”, B&amp;W interiors. Suggested retail price of $16us</strong>. But there are <a href=""http://society6.com/SalgoodSam"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">prints of the colour art</a> available.</p>
<h2><strong>THE DEAL</strong></h2>
<h3>Following <strong>The Early Editions</strong> in March for individual backers, exclusively for Brick &amp; Mortar comics retailers I’m adding the opportunity to make pre-orders of<strong> The Launch Edition</strong>, to be released corresponding with the official launch date of the May 5th-6th weekend of <a href=""http://torontocomics.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">TCAF</a> (Toronto Comic Arts Festival) 2013.</h3>
<p>See the glossary at the bottom of this section for full descriptions of the different editions, there are 3, 5 if you include the digital ones!</p>
<p>Retailers in <strong>Canada</strong> and the <strong>US</strong> can get 5, 10 or 20 books for their shops, to be made available in the weeks before TCAF. Meant to be released the week &amp; weekend of the official launch at the show.</p>
<p>For Retailers in Toronto, I plan be in town at TCAF 2013 attending. Presenting, confirmation of my attendance pending. So I can arrange to visit your shop that week in person!</p>
<p>And, if retailers elsewhere are interested in participating, I’ll be able to arrange pre-orders for anywhere Amazon delivers. I have less control over the timing abroad though,<strong> so I can’t promise these the May 5th-6th weekend</strong>.</p>
<p>They could be as much as 22 days later at the end of the month. With that in mind, I’ve posted rates for the <strong>UK, EU, AU, &amp; NZ</strong>. Let me know if you would like your country estimated.</p>
<p>I’ve set the new retail options up by region, building the shipping fees into the price listed so it’s all straightforward–please take a moment to make sure you enter the right details when <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/224653/pledges/new"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">contributing</a>.</p>
<p>To keep things simple on this site all numbers are in US currency. I'm warned by Amazon that you may have to deal with duties or taxes on your end. </p>
<p>Reatilers participating in this presale will have their name and buisness listed on a thank you page. We will also post listings on <a href=""http://www.salgoodsam.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">salgoodsam.com</a> and <a href=""http://dl.salgoodsam.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the official Dream Life site</a> of all the shops that participate.

<h2>VIRTUAL BOOK TOUR</h2>
<p>With the bookplates and timing synced around my presenting the book at TCAF and related promotional efforts launching the title, it should make for a nice launch-week boost. I’d love to build on that but my ability to travel is limited. However, If you have the facilities in store –<strong> a laptop webcam and decent Internet connection</strong> — I was thinking i could make virtual appearances for an hour or so via skype or hangouts to meet with fans and chat in the days before or just after TCAF as well. Schedule permitting, but <strong>free</strong>!</p>
<p>I would like to get around more but I seldom have the means. So this one of the better chances you have of seeing me ‘in person’ outside of the Montreal/Toronto Corridor.</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Montreal/Toronto Corridor, and Southern Ontario:</strong> retailers interested in me making an appearance should <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=salgood@gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">contact me</a> about scheduling a singing in your store between May 8 to August 5th.</p>
</div>
<div class="""">
<strong>These pre-sales are final after the close of this pre-sale Oct 15.</strong> It would be nice but i can’t support returns, sorry.</div>
<p>Again I will likely have a later round of pre-orders around the holidays so don’t feel pressured to commit  They will be the same prices too.</p>
<p>Details about that, order sizes over 20, or anything else can be discussed via email before you pledge. Feel free to <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/?view=cm&amp;fs=1&amp;tf=1&amp;to=salgood@gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">contact me</a> with questions!</p>

Suggested retail price of $16us. The digital edtions will be PDF or CBR files, the retail price is expected to be $5.99.</p>
<div class="""">
<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Early Edition | March 2013</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The first edition exclusively created for <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/dreamlife1?a=212910"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indiegogo backers of the book</a>, with 10 pages of extended content. A preview of book two, art, and other goodies.</p>
<p>It will be published and shipped through out March 2013. Before the formal launch of Dream Life book one in May 2013.</p>
<p>Early editions will be identifiably marked as being a gift of appreciation for  having contributed. Distinguished inside and out from the Launch editions by unique art and printed bookplates. A special back cover and spine for them each is planed. The run of the Limited Early Editions will be limited to individual supporters who back the book before the funding drive ends October 15th 2012.</p>
</div>
<div class="""">
<ul>
<li><strong>The Launch edition | May 2013</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Like the first Early editions, The Launch edition will have it’s own unique markings and a printed decorated book plate inside the front cover with blank space for a sketch and signature. The spine and back will sport art unique to it as well.</p>
<p>This edition will be a limited run, closing within 3 months of the launch date – May 5th to the August 5th – or when 2000 copies are published, whichever comes first.</p>
</div>
<div class="""">
<ul>
<li><strong>The Standard Edition | August 2013</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After August 2013, orders from retailers and online orders from Amazon will be fulfilled with the standard edition  It will have it’s own unique markings and a printed decorated book plate inside the front cover with blank space for a sketch and signature. It will be nice but somewhat less elaborate. The spine and back will sport art unique to it as well. But it will not be limited at all.</p>
<p>You will not be able to order the Lunch or Early editions on Amazon online, only the standard edition  The Early editions will only come from backing this drive, and the Launch editions only from retailers or me directly at shows for the Launch period.</p>
<p>This by the way is not meant to encourage readers to buy all three. You’re welcome to, but my desire was to build in a way for backers and retailers to have an edge while ultimately planing for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">longest tail</a> possible.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Standard Digital Edition <strong>| August 2013</strong></strong></li>

<p>A <em>PDF </em>of <em>Dream Life | a late coming of age</em>, book one. it’s planed to retail at 5.99, and be broken up into six 99 cent units as well. </p>
<p>It will also be included in the purchase of the physical books from me online or in person after august.</p>

<p>99 cents less than the standard edition. </p>
<p>This one will include the cover art for the first two Editions, and a personalized sketch and signature. It will be available in PDF or CBR. The signed sketch will be mailed to the backers who receive this version. For those getting the physical book they will also receive an adhesive bookplate to include in their copy. This edition will be a digital copy of the Early Edition, and include the same extra 10 pages, modified to include a copy or your unique sketch and signature.</p>
</div></div>","We made it!!! How much further can we go?

To be honest I was not at all confident this would work at first. Well, pressure is on, because I made my first funding goal!
Woooo! :D 
If you would like to help you still can!
your backing will make things a lot easier while i complete the book and the days left until Oct 15th are the last chance to get the limited Early Edition of Dream Life | a late coming of age, book one.
Take a look at the updated perk options and please consider jumping in! I took out those few people were not really going for, but the most popular remain. The $5 digital option, easy on the pocket book and cheaper than the standard Digital will be [99 cents less]. The Materialists options, and The Lucid Dreamer & The Pure Conscious Event will get you the very limited Early Edition of the book with extra content, and there's still Parts and Art to be had too. So have at it! 
For those checking out this campain for the first time, there are a 107 backers for the project so far and counting! I feel like dancing. But when you edit a perk here you loose the head count so thats why the low numbers on the perk descriptions.Backers, don't worry, if yours was one of the perks i took down, all perks will be honoured, my word! If not a few suprises too [working on a few things, probably won't be confirmed till it's time to ship the books so i won't be saying, you'll just have to find out! ;)].
-----Ok, Meating the goal also means I can expand on my plans publishing wise with confidence. Retailers, Comic shop and Book shop folks, look below to the bottom of this page, or here on my home site, for the new Retailers Only options to participate in the coordinated May 5th formal luanch of Dream Life | a late coming of age. 
No small business

--Project Description--
I'm just 30 pages shy of completing Dream Life | a late coming of age.

Hi, my name is Max Douglas, I'm a cartoonist, working under the pen name Salgood Sam, and with your help I’d like to get the first half of the longest story I've ever tried to tell completed in time for TCAF 2013.
I'm very close already, over 115 pages are done, just a mere thirty left to complete the first three chapters. I hope with this campaign I can dedicate the rest of this year to making those thirty pages my primary focus.
This story is a labour of love. A work of fiction with fantastic and adventure elements. It borrows from my own life--as close to autobiography as I've dared in many ways. The cast is an amalgam of people I've known and myself, played off archetypes. The situations and conflicts borrow from my own experiences and stories I've been close to.
Charlie's childhood friend is about to die.Hitch hiking in BC PJ's luck runs out.Lionel is in existential free-fall.Leslie is a therapist and part time drug dealer.It's just occurring to her she hates her job.Dan's daughter thinks he needs to grow up.-The story of five friends.Dreams, drugs, & denialall failing to weatherthe arc of life unscathed.Each coming to terms with lives peter panned,and in danger of going off the rails.

I've worked both commercially and independently for others most of the 20+ years that I've been a cartoonist. I've been lucky to often make my living doing that but there are always trade-offs and limits to the work.
With Dream Life I'm trying to do all the things i've always wanted to, tell a story that I'd want to read--without compromise or conditions.
I've been very lucky to receive grant funding for Dream Life in the past. That had been a huge help getting this far. But life throws us unforeseen curves: In early 2011, I was diagnosed with testicular cancer, and had an operation to remove it. I got lucky, hopefully will stay lucky. But I did lose a lot of time to that, dealing with the stress, distractions, and recovering from the operation.
And just as I was getting back to feeling normal, I got slammed by a bacterial infection in my stomach in the fall, lost fifteen pounds in two weeks, and a couple months due to being laid out and exhausted by that. So while the grant made getting as far as I have possible, and recovering a lot less stressful, I did not get as far as I had wanted to. So close though. So so close.
So it goes. I'm grateful and I'll keep at it one way or another, but the grant funds are gone now. Working as a freelancer takes up most of my time. Between finding the next job and doing the jobs, I’m left with little space to squeak out pages.
So I thought I’d try crowdfunding to make room to wrap up this first half of the book and put a small run of 100 B&W first editions in time for TCAF 2013. To do that I need to finance 3 months of focused work on this and this alone. 

I also plan to upload the book to Create Space [Amazon] so it will be available to all right away, either in print or digitally via their app market.On my own I’ll get there one day but probably not in time for TCAF, and I have other obligations in 2013 that will probably cause even more delays. So now’s the time to make this happen.
What I Need & What You Get[update: i've added printed edtions care of Create Space for some!]
The minimum to ensure this all happens is I think, $3500.
I've set the goal here at $3800 because of the site fees. If we reach $3800, what I'll get is just a bit over $3500. If we fall short the fees are a bit higher [4% if we match the goal, 9% if we fall short].
If we can surpass the goal, the surplus initially will go into better printing and/or a larger run for the first edition, and a bit more time/peace of mind.
If it looks like we're really going to knock it out of the park I'll think of some new worthy expanded goals, and perks. More art and reserved copies of the first edition are the first likely candidates.
For now I want to keep the bar low, so $3000 to cover living expenses while I do the work, and $500 to go mostly towards perks, maybe a bit left over for printing the first editions.The smallest support option is $5, with the perk of getting a digital edition [PDF or CBR, specify your preference when you dontate] of Dream Life | a late coming of age, book one. Like all supporters will get your name listed on the thank you page in the book and on my site unless you request otherwise. This option is essentially a pre-order of the digital edtion which will be sold for about that give or take a cent. I'm considering also making a set of 5 ¢99 versions available too but either way, $5. But by supporting now you will be the first to get Dream life, even before the early print editons are mailed out you'll be able to download your digital copy!
Updated: Folks who took 15 dollar personal digital edition will still get it but i removed it in the list to make room for new options. Personalized editions can still be had via the ""get's personal"" perks offered: For the supporters backing with $15 or more, their digital editions will be personalized, with a scanned handwritten signature, note, and sketch inside the “front page”. This will be unique to the funding drive.
The physical copy of signature pages will be mailed to you via regular letter post [no express or registered mail]. I'll be sending you an adhesive bookplate too if you're getting a copy of the book now.
Starting at $25 us, $35 for canadian and international backers [postage fees inc], by having supported the project you will receive the Limited Early Edition of the book, with 10 pages of extended content. A preview of book two, art, and other goodies.
You will again be among the first to see it, receiving your copies in March. Before the formal launch in May 2013! Your early editions will be identifiably marked as a result of having contributed Distinguished inside and out from the Launch editions. I'm thinking i'll draw a special back cover and spine for them both. The run will be limited to supporters who back the book before the funding drive ends October 15th 2012.
For $35 us, $ 45 for canadian and international backers [postage fees inc], you get A personalized digital copy, a copy of the singed page with sketch, and the Limited Early Edition of Dream life | a late coming of age. The signature page will be done on paper the right size to fit in your physical copy. I'm including an Adhesive bookplate designed for the Limited Early Edition too now. I'll be happy to do so again in person someday too if I happen to meet you. And shake your hand too! I might get emotional. :D
All Sociaty6 prints and the digital library of my independat work  have been removed as options. Not to worry, those who got them will be honoured of course! And if you miss the prints, you can always go for small donation here and get something from the shop!
For $100, along with all of that. you will get a bit part as an extra for one or more panels in Dream Life. 6 of these have been taken, expect to see cartoonists in this. :)
I'll send you a print of your cameo page along with the signature page in the mail.
Finally, $200 will get you either a piece of original art from Dream Life, or a private commision. Anything you like within reason [I won’t draw something I find offensive or otherwise objectionable]. This perk also comes with the printed book, and the digital catalog including personalized Dream Life-book one.
I've been tweaking the perks. Have a look and see what fits you!
What will be the Impact?
Well put simply, you will make my day, life, etc. It's really frustrating to be so close to being done this chunk of the book, and have to work on it in dribs and drabs.
I want Dream Life to be my BEST work. So, having the freedom to dedicate my energy to it alone for any amount of time will be awesome.
I can't promise you this book will change the world or solve poverty, but it will change my life; getting as far as I have already has, as it's already been noticed and got me nominated for an award last year as a web comic. Completing it and being able to present it in time for TCAF next year will mean the accomplishment of a major life and career goal. And for what it’s worth, I do think work that aspires to the standards and richness I hope to bring to Dream Life, enriches our world over all. Stories that have heart and integrity and try to make us think while being entertaining and beautiful.
With your help that's what I hope to bring forth.
Other Ways You Can Help
I've made it easy to pitch in even a little, but if you're really unable to support Dream Life financially, you can always help by telling as many other people as you can about this funding drive, and Dream Life generally. Use the Indiegogo social sharing tools, ‘like’ the fan page on Facebook, and share this link to the first 100+ pages online, on Facebook, Google+, or the webcomic page here, free to read.
Many thanks.
------------------------------------
I would not have gotten this far without help.Thanks to Jonathan Sugarman, who helped inspire this story, started the adventure with me and left lots of fun words to play with.
Thanks to Sadoceanspacebear, for the beautiful sounds.
To a.j.duric for showing me how to craft a grant application.
& A.J.Murphy for checking my grammar.
And many more too numerous to name.
And far from least, the generous funding ofthe Canadian Council for the Arts

We acknowledge the support of the Canada Council for the Arts, which last year invested $154 million to bring the arts to Canadians throughout the country.
Nous remercions le Conseil des arts du Canada de son soutien. L’an dernier, le Conseil a investi 154 millions de dollars pour mettre de l’art dans la vie des Canadiennes et des Canadiens de tout le pays.
 
 
 !!---------- Retailers Only------------!!

9 days for Second tier goals.

Expanding on plans, publishing wise.
I’ve just met my main goal for a crowd funding campaign to finance completing  Dream Life: a late coming of age!
So with a little over a week left in this funding drive, I’m going to go forward with a modified version of my second-tier goal and put up a set of retailer options!
There are variables that have to be entered manually, make sure you read carfully before entering, and please do contact me too. It would be nice for the exchange to be more personal and we can confirm the package you opted for.
You also have the option of doing this less publicly, via emal and other payment options, we don’t have to use Indiegogo for this.
To have a look at the contents of the book, I’ve created a trailer on youtube, and feel free to read through the 100+ pages here, or here, or here, or via this PDF file.  The web versions has some colour pages, something I was playing with but don’t have time to complete that way in the foreseeable future. For now the book is to be black and white like the PDF. The Launch edition will be 150 pages, colour cover, 6”x9”, B&W interiors. Suggested retail price of $16us. But there are prints of the colour art available.
THE DEAL
Following The Early Editions in March for individual backers, exclusively for Brick & Mortar comics retailers I’m adding the opportunity to make pre-orders of The Launch Edition, to be released corresponding with the official launch date of the May 5th-6th weekend of TCAF (Toronto Comic Arts Festival) 2013.
See the glossary at the bottom of this section for full descriptions of the different editions, there are 3, 5 if you include the digital ones!
Retailers in Canada and the US can get 5, 10 or 20 books for their shops, to be made available in the weeks before TCAF. Meant to be released the week & weekend of the official launch at the show.
For Retailers in Toronto, I plan be in town at TCAF 2013 attending. Presenting, confirmation of my attendance pending. So I can arrange to visit your shop that week in person!
And, if retailers elsewhere are interested in participating, I’ll be able to arrange pre-orders for anywhere Amazon delivers. I have less control over the timing abroad though, so I can’t promise these the May 5th-6th weekend.
They could be as much as 22 days later at the end of the month. With that in mind, I’ve posted rates for the UK, EU, AU, & NZ. Let me know if you would like your country estimated.
I’ve set the new retail options up by region, building the shipping fees into the price listed so it’s all straightforward–please take a moment to make sure you enter the right details when contributing.
To keep things simple on this site all numbers are in US currency. I'm warned by Amazon that you may have to deal with duties or taxes on your end. 
Reatilers participating in this presale will have their name and buisness listed on a thank you page. We will also post listings on salgoodsam.com and the official Dream Life site of all the shops that participate. That will include detailed info about where you are located, hours, and contact info.

VIRTUAL BOOK TOUR
With the bookplates and timing synced around my presenting the book at TCAF and related promotional efforts launching the title, it should make for a nice launch-week boost. I’d love to build on that but my ability to travel is limited. However, If you have the facilities in store – a laptop webcam and decent Internet connection — I was thinking i could make virtual appearances for an hour or so via skype or hangouts to meet with fans and chat in the days before or just after TCAF as well. Schedule permitting, but free!
I would like to get around more but I seldom have the means. So this one of the better chances you have of seeing me ‘in person’ outside of the Montreal/Toronto Corridor.
Inside the Montreal/Toronto Corridor, and Southern Ontario: retailers interested in me making an appearance should contact me about scheduling a singing in your store between May 8 to August 5th.


These pre-sales are final after the close of this pre-sale Oct 15. It would be nice but i can’t support returns, sorry.
Again I will likely have a later round of pre-orders around the holidays so don’t feel pressured to commit  They will be the same prices too.
Details about that, order sizes over 20, or anything else can be discussed via email before you pledge. Feel free to contact me with questions!
 
GLOSSARY OF EDITIONS
The Books will be produced via CreateSpace and shipped in North America to arrive the week before May 5th. Up to 22 days Later overseas. 150 pages, colour cover, 6”x9”, B&W interiors. Suggested retail price of $16us. The digital edtions will be PDF or CBR files, the retail price is expected to be $5.99.


Limited Early Edition | March 2013

The first edition exclusively created for Indiegogo backers of the book, with 10 pages of extended content. A preview of book two, art, and other goodies.
It will be published and shipped through out March 2013. Before the formal launch of Dream Life book one in May 2013.
Early editions will be identifiably marked as being a gift of appreciation for  having contributed. Distinguished inside and out from the Launch editions by unique art and printed bookplates. A special back cover and spine for them each is planed. The run of the Limited Early Editions will be limited to individual supporters who back the book before the funding drive ends October 15th 2012.



The Launch edition | May 2013

Like the first Early editions, The Launch edition will have it’s own unique markings and a printed decorated book plate inside the front cover with blank space for a sketch and signature. The spine and back will sport art unique to it as well.
This edition will be a limited run, closing within 3 months of the launch date – May 5th to the August 5th – or when 2000 copies are published, whichever comes first.



The Standard Edition | August 2013

After August 2013, orders from retailers and online orders from Amazon will be fulfilled with the standard edition  It will have it’s own unique markings and a printed decorated book plate inside the front cover with blank space for a sketch and signature. It will be nice but somewhat less elaborate. The spine and back will sport art unique to it as well. But it will not be limited at all.
You will not be able to order the Lunch or Early editions on Amazon online, only the standard edition  The Early editions will only come from backing this drive, and the Launch editions only from retailers or me directly at shows for the Launch period.
This by the way is not meant to encourage readers to buy all three. You’re welcome to, but my desire was to build in a way for backers and retailers to have an edge while ultimately planing for the longest tail possible.



The Standard Digital Edition | August 2013

A PDF of Dream Life | a late coming of age, book one. it’s planed to retail at 5.99, and be broken up into six 99 cent units as well. 
It will also be included in the purchase of the physical books from me online or in person after august.



The Personalized Digital Edition | March 2013

Exclusively from the Indiegogo funding drive. It is being offered during the funding drive exclusively at $5.
99 cents less than the standard edition. 
This one will include the cover art for the first two Editions, and a personalized sketch and signature. It will be available in PDF or CBR. The signed sketch will be mailed to the backers who receive this version. For those getting the physical book they will also receive an adhesive bookplate to include in their copy. This edition will be a digital copy of the Early Edition, and include the same extra 10 pages, modified to include a copy or your unique sketch and signature.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>About the Story</strong></h2>
<p>""The Pipers"" is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, who wrote over 100 short stories and over 40 books — many of which are responsible for films such as Blade Runner, Minority Report, Total Recall and The Man in the High Castle.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>About the Creators</h2>
<p>We are siblings! We were born 18 months apart in Portland, Oregon to parents who self-published over 20 books — books are in our blood! Paul du Coudray is a designer / artist / illustrator living in Taos, New Mexico. Beth is an author, speaker, and illustrator living in Portland, Oregon. She has illustrated books such as Before They Were Authors, I, Parrot, and The Girl Who Named Pluto.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Why Print?</h2>
<p>Mascot is publishing books as a way of creating 'artifacts' and some artifacts deserve to be held. We also recognize that making a book requires resources and the actual impact of consuming resources is exponentially more complicated than just what goes into making a book. As we strive to make all printed works as tree-worthy as possible, we are additionally donating money for at least 1 tree to be planted per printed book.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>Indiegogo is the perfect platform to fund the completion and printing of this book, and offers us the ability to produce books for exactly how many people would like to buy them! We already have a print broker lined up, a warehouse in Colorado ready for shipping &amp; fulfillment — so why are we asking for money? We want to know how many books to print for you! One of the most exciting things about this project is that we are done... with the WHOLE book... let's go to print!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Affordability</h2>
<p>We're offering an e-book for international supporters because shipping books outside of the U.S.A. is crazy expensive. We also want to make this book accessible to anyone in the world, and to honor the rights-free status of Philip K. Dick’s story. If for any reason you can’t afford the print version and don’t have a dollar to spare for the digital version, you can direct message Paul on Instagram when the project is over and we’ll send you a link for a free download!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Gifts</h2>
<p>Do you want to give this as a gift to someone for the holiday or just because? Send the following link, or download the PDF to give to loved ones while they await the book in the mail! Check it out:</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Timing</h2>
<p>When the Indiegogo ends we'll know how many books to print and we'll place an order shortly thereafter! The process of printing takes about 3 months, so you could expect your book(s) sometime in early Spring :-)</p>

<h2>Mascot</h2>
<p>Studio Mascot, founded by Paul du Coudray, is growing up to be a group of practitioners who are exploring a variety of themes within multiple mediums.</p> <p>Mascot Press • A small press devoted to important works. We have several more books planned for 2019.</p> <p>Mascot Films • We are working on a couple of film projects, ranging from animated films to documentary style.</p> <p>Mascot Foundry • Our mini-foundry was created in order to share the hand-written fonts that we use in our projects with other artists. Why? Because most of the hand-written fonts out there suck. We hope ours don’t suck and that you enjoy using them.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>(1) International shipping is expensive and therefore a major challenge is that the bulk of the minimum funding necessary will need to come mostly from people within the U.S.A. (2) Quality control can also be a challenge when printing, but we're using the same print brokers in Colorado that have helped us — and our family — in the past multiple times!</p>

Paul du Coudray is a designer / artist / illustrator living in Taos, New Mexico. Beth is an author, speaker, and illustrator living in Portland, Oregon. She has illustrated books such as Before They Were Authors, I, Parrot, and The Girl Who Named Pluto.
 
Why Print?
Mascot is publishing books as a way of creating 'artifacts' and some artifacts deserve to be held. We also recognize that making a book requires resources and the actual impact of consuming resources is exponentially more complicated than just what goes into making a book. As we strive to make all printed works as tree-worthy as possible, we are additionally donating money for at least 1 tree to be planted per printed book.
 
Why Indiegogo?
Indiegogo is the perfect platform to fund the completion and printing of this book, and offers us the ability to produce books for exactly how many people would like to buy them! We already have a print broker lined up, a warehouse in Colorado ready for shipping & fulfillment — so why are we asking for money? We want to know how many books to print for you! One of the most exciting things about this project is that we are done... with the WHOLE book... let's go to print!
 
Affordability
We're offering an e-book for international supporters because shipping books outside of the U.S.A. is crazy expensive. We also want to make this book accessible to anyone in the world, and to honor the rights-free status of Philip K. Dick’s story. If for any reason you can’t afford the print version and don’t have a dollar to spare for the digital version, you can direct message Paul on Instagram when the project is over and we’ll send you a link for a free download!
 
Gifts
Do you want to give this as a gift to someone for the holiday or just because? Send the following link, or download the PDF to give to loved ones while they await the book in the mail! Check it out:
https://www.mascot.studio/gift

 
Timing
When the Indiegogo ends we'll know how many books to print and we'll place an order shortly thereafter! The process of printing takes about 3 months, so you could expect your book(s) sometime in early Spring :-)

Mascot
Studio Mascot, founded by Paul du Coudray, is growing up to be a group of practitioners who are exploring a variety of themes within multiple mediums. Mascot Press • A small press devoted to important works. We have several more books planned for 2019. Mascot Films • We are working on a couple of film projects, ranging from animated films to documentary style. Mascot Foundry • Our mini-foundry was created in order to share the hand-written fonts that we use in our projects with other artists. Why? Because most of the hand-written fonts out there suck. We hope ours don’t suck and that you enjoy using them.

Thanks!

Risks and challenges
(1) International shipping is expensive and therefore a major challenge is that the bulk of the minimum funding necessary will need to come mostly from people within the U.S.A. (2) Quality control can also be a challenge when printing, but we're using the same print brokers in Colorado that have helped us — and our family — in the past multiple times!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About The Artist</h3>
<p>A graduate of the University of Cincinnati with a degree in painting, Russell has run the gamut in comics. After establishing a name for himself at Marvel on Killraven and Dr. Strange, he went on to become one of the pioneers in opening new vistas for this underestimated field with, among other works, adaptations of operas by Mozart (THE MAGIC FLUTE), Strauss (SALOME) and Wagner (THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG). Craig has completed five volumes of comic-book adaptations of the FAIRY TALES OF OSCAR WILDE and has beautifully brought to life characters as diverse as Batman, Conan, Hellboy, The Spirit, Death and The Sandman. His more recent work includes comic book adaptations of Neil Gaiman’s CORALINE and THE GRAVEYARD BOOK.</p>
<h3>Our Fourth Art Restoration Campaign</h3>
<p>We are pleased to launch our fourth art restoration-related crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the scanning, restoration and preservation of the original color art that P. Craig Russell created for his comic-book adaptation of THE JUNGLE BOOK stories ""The King's Ankus"" and ""Red Dog!""</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479351506/qdrcjsouujuofaj0glvx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Coloring Comics In The 1980s</h3>
<p>Back in the 1980s and early 90s, well before computer coloring, P. Craig Russell decided that he wanted to hand-color a number of his creator-owned projects using mixed media to allow for more gradations in color, mood and effect. To start with, he had his original black-and-white line art reproduced on letter-sized sheets of clear plastic. He then placed that plastic copy over another piece of letter-sized art paper. When hand-coloring, he would lift the plastic sheet repeatedly, over and over and over again, so that he could apply the mixed-media color to the bottom sheet. It was an insanely time-intensive process, but the end results were uniquely and undeniably beautiful. When the art was published, it was shot from the reduced color “masters"" with the reduced black &amp; white linework overlaid via the plastic.</p>
<p>In recent years, this original original color art has deteriorated badly, with much of it becoming “mottled,” chipped, faded and decayed. The plastic overlays with the black and white line art have also yellowed, shrunk and flaked away. These first color ""masters"" are pretty much unusable for any future presentation of these groundbreaking stories. All are in dire need of both restoration and preservation. This includes the color art for such landmark projects as SALOME, THE MAGIC FLUTE, PELLEAS AND MELISANDE, THE JUNGLE BOOK, HUMAN REMAINS. THE GIFT OF THE MAGI and more. We are attempting to restore and preserve all of these masterworks on a project-by-project basis.</p>
<p>To date, we've successfully crowdfunded restorations of  ARIANE AND BLUEBEARD, THE DREAMING CITY and WHILE THE GODS LAUGH. This fourth campaign is to restore and preserve P. Craig Russell's original color art for two of his JUNGLE BOOK stories—""The King's Ankus"" and ""Red Dog.""</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479352296/lqvgwsbdztf69zqi9jt3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Our Restoration and Preservation Process</h3>
<p>First, an “Artifact Scan” will be made of each original comic art page. While appearing to be in black and white, each original art page is scanned in color to show blue pencil and other corrections. This is to create a digital file of the original page for preservation and posterity:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479180923/go7kf68oae3tefg4vrzq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The second step will be to create a second high resolution scan—this time in black &amp; white—to capture Craig's black ink art in as pristine a manner as possible. The bitmap scan is then gone over with a fine-tooth “digital comb” to remove as many imperfections as possible—again, to capture the ink art as crisply and cleanly as possible:</p>

About The Artist
A graduate of the University of Cincinnati with a degree in painting, Russell has run the gamut in comics. After establishing a name for himself at Marvel on Killraven and Dr. Strange, he went on to become one of the pioneers in opening new vistas for this underestimated field with, among other works, adaptations of operas by Mozart (THE MAGIC FLUTE), Strauss (SALOME) and Wagner (THE RING OF THE NIBELUNG). Craig has completed five volumes of comic-book adaptations of the FAIRY TALES OF OSCAR WILDE and has beautifully brought to life characters as diverse as Batman, Conan, Hellboy, The Spirit, Death and The Sandman. His more recent work includes comic book adaptations of Neil Gaiman’s CORALINE and THE GRAVEYARD BOOK.
Our Fourth Art Restoration Campaign
We are pleased to launch our fourth art restoration-related crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the scanning, restoration and preservation of the original color art that P. Craig Russell created for his comic-book adaptation of THE JUNGLE BOOK stories ""The King's Ankus"" and ""Red Dog!""

Coloring Comics In The 1980s
Back in the 1980s and early 90s, well before computer coloring, P. Craig Russell decided that he wanted to hand-color a number of his creator-owned projects using mixed media to allow for more gradations in color, mood and effect. To start with, he had his original black-and-white line art reproduced on letter-sized sheets of clear plastic. He then placed that plastic copy over another piece of letter-sized art paper. When hand-coloring, he would lift the plastic sheet repeatedly, over and over and over again, so that he could apply the mixed-media color to the bottom sheet. It was an insanely time-intensive process, but the end results were uniquely and undeniably beautiful. When the art was published, it was shot from the reduced color “masters"" with the reduced black & white linework overlaid via the plastic.
In recent years, this original original color art has deteriorated badly, with much of it becoming “mottled,” chipped, faded and decayed. The plastic overlays with the black and white line art have also yellowed, shrunk and flaked away. These first color ""masters"" are pretty much unusable for any future presentation of these groundbreaking stories. All are in dire need of both restoration and preservation. This includes the color art for such landmark projects as SALOME, THE MAGIC FLUTE, PELLEAS AND MELISANDE, THE JUNGLE BOOK, HUMAN REMAINS. THE GIFT OF THE MAGI and more. We are attempting to restore and preserve all of these masterworks on a project-by-project basis.
To date, we've successfully crowdfunded restorations of  ARIANE AND BLUEBEARD, THE DREAMING CITY and WHILE THE GODS LAUGH. This fourth campaign is to restore and preserve P. Craig Russell's original color art for two of his JUNGLE BOOK stories—""The King's Ankus"" and ""Red Dog.""

Our Restoration and Preservation Process
First, an “Artifact Scan” will be made of each original comic art page. While appearing to be in black and white, each original art page is scanned in color to show blue pencil and other corrections. This is to create a digital file of the original page for preservation and posterity:

The second step will be to create a second high resolution scan—this time in black & white—to capture Craig's black ink art in as pristine a manner as possible. The bitmap scan is then gone over with a fine-tooth “digital comb” to remove as many imperfections as possible—again, to capture the ink art as crisply and cleanly as possible:

We then take Craig's original mixed-media hand-coloring and scan it at a very high resolution:
 
Finally, the super-sharp, original black line art is taken from our second scan and combined with the newly-restored hand coloring in an all-new, high resolution digital file. This is the cleanest, clearest presentation that this stunning art has ever had—and it’s now beautifully restored and preserved for generations to come:


What We Need & What You Get
This multi-year undertaking is going to be extremely expensive and time-consuming, so we are raising funds for the restorations via a series of project-related crowd-funded campaigns. 
Please keep in mind that after we pay IndieGoGo fees, PayPal fees for credit card processing, income taxes (funds raised via crowdfunding campaigns are considered as income and thus are taxable) and the substantial costs of creating, manufacturing and shipping our physical perks . . . not a lot of money is left over. After the dust clears, we still have to have sufficient funds remaining for the primary purpose of the campaign—to restore and preserve P. Craig Russell's original art.

<h3>About the project</h3>
<p>'Undocumented: The Architecture of Migrant Detention Centres' is a graphic account of the conditions in Canada's horrific migrant detention system by author and activist Tings Chak. Here's Tings in her own words:</p>
<p><i>""On September 17, 2013, just two weeks into my final semester of architecture graduate school, something historic happened: 191 migrant men in immigration detention centre in Central East Correctional Centre—a maximum security prison in Lindsay, Ontario—went on hunger strike. These men—among the thousands of women, men, and children across the country detained every year indefinitely without charge or trial—refused meals, refused enter their cells, and did so in the face of already great repression and isolation. They were resisting the fact that their freedom was being stolen simply because they were born in the ""wrong"" place.</i></p>
<p><i>As a student who felt too politicized, too radical, and too involved in migrant justice movements, I struggled to talk about detention centres in architecture settings. To me, it was clear how architecture gets used to uphold state violence against migrants, particularly working class Black and Brown migrants. To me, immigration detention was an architecture problem if only for the fact that architects design, build, and profit off of the detention of migrants!</i></p>
<p><i>Even the most well-meaning of liberal architects and architecture students alike would end up asking me, What about a better (more humane/green/socially responsible) detention centre? </i></p>
<p><i>But my answer would be: No prisons. No detention. No families separated by cages. The answer is: Freedom to move, return, and stay.</i></p>
<p><i>During those months following the hunger strike, while intensely organizing with grassroots groups like No One is Illegal - Toronto and End Immigration Detention Network that took leadership from immigration detainees, I explored more this question of the architecture of migrant detention. But the more I searched, the more I realized how hidden this world was—intentionally so. The buildings, like the people locked inside them, were undocumented.</i></p>
<p><i>So began this unusual project of using the architectural tools of representation I learned in school as a political tool of documenting and reconstructing these sites of detention. Unbeknownst to me, what emerged was a graphic ""novel,"" or visual essay, or architectural documentary called Undocumented: The Architecture of Migrant Detention.</i></p>
<p><i>This is a project about implicating the many hands who participate in and profit from the design and construction of detention centres. This is a project about bringing in these out-of-sight-out-of-mind realities into our conversations about the built environment.</i></p>
<p><i>But most importantly, this is a project about provocation, inviting YOU, the reader, to join us in the political project of dreaming (and building) a world without prisons and without borders.</i></p>
<p><i>tings chak""</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487374503/kmnid6ool9d2d40wgnon.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Whether we are situated in the United States, Canada, Australia, or anywhere in the European Union, the nature of migrant detention centers remains much the same. This book will help readers and activists around the world better understand the consequences of a world that militarizes its borders, and criminalizes those who cross them in the name of ""national security"".</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The basics about Undocumented:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>It was first published as a series of zines, then as a small-run of less than 1,000 copies.<br/> </li>
<li>This time, we're aiming to print 3,000 copies.<br/> </li>
<li>Ad Astra Comix is a Canadian publishing collective dedicated to producing social justice comics.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the deal:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a pre-order campaign. For the most part, you'll be ordering a copy of the book, which you'll receive as soon as it's printed (approximately a month before the book will be available in stores).  $8000 pays for the book's printing, transport, and related operating costs. If we raise more than $8000, we have some exciting ideas that we can share with you when the time comes.<br/> </li>
<li>Royalties on this title are being donated by the author to the End Immigration Detention Network, so every book purchased helps in the fight for migrant justice!<br/> </li>
<li>We've set a goal that will allow us to print 3,000 copies. If we don't raise the full amount, we will do a smaller print run to ensure the book still reaches as many people as possible - including you, as a funder.<br/> </li>
<li>A number of rad artists around the world have contributed unique, original art for sale to support the crowdfunder. If you order one of these prints, you'll not only be supporting the publication of the book, but supporting the important work of political artists. In short: you're awesome!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By pre-ordering a copy of this book, you are making this special edition of ""Undocumented"" possible. Here's why that matters:</p>

'Undocumented: The Architecture of Migrant Detention Centres' is a graphic account of the conditions in Canada's horrific migrant detention system by author and activist Tings Chak. Here's Tings in her own words:
""On September 17, 2013, just two weeks into my final semester of architecture graduate school, something historic happened: 191 migrant men in immigration detention centre in Central East Correctional Centre—a maximum security prison in Lindsay, Ontario—went on hunger strike. These men—among the thousands of women, men, and children across the country detained every year indefinitely without charge or trial—refused meals, refused enter their cells, and did so in the face of already great repression and isolation. They were resisting the fact that their freedom was being stolen simply because they were born in the ""wrong"" place.
As a student who felt too politicized, too radical, and too involved in migrant justice movements, I struggled to talk about detention centres in architecture settings. To me, it was clear how architecture gets used to uphold state violence against migrants, particularly working class Black and Brown migrants. To me, immigration detention was an architecture problem if only for the fact that architects design, build, and profit off of the detention of migrants!
Even the most well-meaning of liberal architects and architecture students alike would end up asking me, What about a better (more humane/green/socially responsible) detention centre? 
But my answer would be: No prisons. No detention. No families separated by cages. The answer is: Freedom to move, return, and stay.
During those months following the hunger strike, while intensely organizing with grassroots groups like No One is Illegal - Toronto and End Immigration Detention Network that took leadership from immigration detainees, I explored more this question of the architecture of migrant detention. But the more I searched, the more I realized how hidden this world was—intentionally so. The buildings, like the people locked inside them, were undocumented.
So began this unusual project of using the architectural tools of representation I learned in school as a political tool of documenting and reconstructing these sites of detention. Unbeknownst to me, what emerged was a graphic ""novel,"" or visual essay, or architectural documentary called Undocumented: The Architecture of Migrant Detention.
This is a project about implicating the many hands who participate in and profit from the design and construction of detention centres. This is a project about bringing in these out-of-sight-out-of-mind realities into our conversations about the built environment.
But most importantly, this is a project about provocation, inviting YOU, the reader, to join us in the political project of dreaming (and building) a world without prisons and without borders.
tings chak""

Whether we are situated in the United States, Canada, Australia, or anywhere in the European Union, the nature of migrant detention centers remains much the same. This book will help readers and activists around the world better understand the consequences of a world that militarizes its borders, and criminalizes those who cross them in the name of ""national security"".
 
The basics about Undocumented:

It was first published as a series of zines, then as a small-run of less than 1,000 copies. 
This time, we're aiming to print 3,000 copies. 
Ad Astra Comix is a Canadian publishing collective dedicated to producing social justice comics.


What We Need & What You Get
Here's the deal:

This is a pre-order campaign. For the most part, you'll be ordering a copy of the book, which you'll receive as soon as it's printed (approximately a month before the book will be available in stores).  $8000 pays for the book's printing, transport, and related operating costs. If we raise more than $8000, we have some exciting ideas that we can share with you when the time comes. 
Royalties on this title are being donated by the author to the End Immigration Detention Network, so every book purchased helps in the fight for migrant justice! 
We've set a goal that will allow us to print 3,000 copies. If we don't raise the full amount, we will do a smaller print run to ensure the book still reaches as many people as possible - including you, as a funder. 
A number of rad artists around the world have contributed unique, original art for sale to support the crowdfunder. If you order one of these prints, you'll not only be supporting the publication of the book, but supporting the important work of political artists. In short: you're awesome!




The Impact
By pre-ordering a copy of this book, you are making this special edition of ""Undocumented"" possible. Here's why that matters:
Migrant detention is a horrific practice that is largely unknown, even in the communities that host migrant detention centers. We hope that this book (and the art from our art drive) can help raise awareness about this struggle.

This book will be an invaluable resource for understanding the conditions in the migrant detention system. The success of this crowdfunder will send a message that awareness around this issue is growing, and add to the chorus of voices challenging the practice of migrant detention.

Supporting this crowdfunder helps show the world that there is a demand for projects like this one - comics that are not only entertaining, but informative! Your support on this project helps us continue to make comics about social justice--that inform AND engage.

<h3>OMG! A Horror Anthology #1</h3>
<p>I am Robert Dieterle I started  Aequitas Comics in July 2018 with the idea of bringing a fresh new way of publishing new comics using veteran and up and coming artists from around the world. What better of a way than an anthology to makes it easy to mix up old and new talent. </p>
<p>Our horror anthology is the ground work for introducing a variety of new characters that will have the opportunity to become their own stand alone comic series. We have a dozen short stories in production for issues 2 and 3 along with 2 stories we hope to be successful by themselves.  </p>
<p>By contributing to our project you will help us bring new talent to the industry with new ideas. As you all know Anthologies can go on forever and we plan on keeping them scary, funny, dramatic, and to have the person reading the stories thinking to themselves OMG!  at the end of each short story.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The goal is 5k</h3>
<p>5k would fund the printing of the book in the united states. That way we can start shipping the day the campaign ends. Remember the book is done, all edits are complete and its ready for print.</p>
<p>Each book will be inspected prior to shipping and packed with press board to prevent damage. If we reach our goal everyone gets a 8 x 10 print of a random character from the book, by one of the following artists; Ryan Kincaid, Tone Rodriguez, Chris Ehnot, Jose Varese, Candice Dailey, or Josh Church.</p>
<p>If we do not reach the 5k we will still print the necessary amount of books to fill every order placed. If we surpass the goal every $2500.00 we will add stickers, bracelets, koozies, and metal trading cards.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Success!</h3>
<p>Getting a good comic book with awesome artists working together on great content is what the success of this campaign will bring to the world of comics. Here is the list of contributors for issue #1; Tone Rodriguez, Ryan Kincaid, Rob Broussard, Chris Ehnot, McLain McGuire, Jose Varese, Jeremy Clark, Jake Goodman, Damon Pellican, Candice Dailey, Raymund Lee, Bill Morrison, Jorge Cortes, Albert Morales, Joshua Church, David Delanty, and Robert Dieterle.</p>

</div></div>","I Need to Comic Strip. My name is Alexander Shen and I'm pretty avid comic strip drawer. I love comic strips and the fact I get to tell a story or joke in such a limited amount of space.


There are times when I have a great idea, but don't have anything to jot it down on. Sometimes the only piece of paper I have is the back of a ketchup stained receipt. Sometimes I don't have access to my tablet or I forgot my sketchbook at home because I was working on something non-comic related.
The Comic Strip Notepad gives you 50 pages of blank comic strip panels to keep at all the places (the office, your car, at school, wherever) so you're never without a place to draw comics.



Why $600? No frills, my friends. It allows me to get enough notepads printed to keep costs down and to ship them to you.



What does the notepad look like?
Each Comic Strip Notepad offers:


50 pages
The notepad measures 4.25"" x 5.5""
4 panels - each 2"" x 1.75"" (to be used horizontally or vertically)
3 lines for writing down notes

<h3><i>Into the Breach</i></h3>
<p>The ACOR asset recovery team is contracted to track down and recover invaluable data from a lost terraforming ship the Argo, that was bound for Saturn's moon, Titan.  Immediately after boarding, Logan, Sam, Nikki, Bjorn, Wil and their handler, Angelica quickly find themselves in a fight for their lives with a rival recovery firm and an unknown species of space-faring parasites quickly labeled ""xeno-morphs"" that have been feeding off the cargo.</p>

<p><b>Hey!</b></p><p>I am an artist and writer and I have decided to put
together and publish a graphic novel of my own short stories and I need your
help! I was fist published in comics at the age of 14 and over the years I have
worked on many cool projects  including
an illustrated story for Heavy Metal Magazine which I will include in this book!
To let you know a little more about me I have also done design and illustration
work for games, film and television working on some fantastic projects such as Through The Worm Hole With Morgan Freeman, Tugger The Ship and the game Dungeon Crawler. I have even wrote and directed a short film about a shape shifter called ""Shifter""<br/></p>
<p>This awesome new graphic novel will showcase some of my coolest
sci-fi and fantasy work! THE BOOK will feature 12 short stories, ranging from 1 or 2 pages to 20, and as mentioned will include my Cyberpunk story ""The Living City"" published by Heavy Metal Magazine. We are hoping to have the book out and in print by March 2016 but are hoping for an earlier release date if all things go well. <br/></p>
<p>To the right I have some wonderful incentives for you to
look over as you consider helping make this awesome publication a reality. I still have some work to do to complete The Book but most of the $5,000.00 in funds will go to the printing costs, a portion of it will also go to my very good friend and team member, Rene Vriends who is helping with lettering, scanning original pages and other odds and ends to help the production go more smoothly. THE BOOK will be 60 plus pages, full colour, square bound <i>and
beautiful</i>! Here is your chance to become a part of its creation!<br/></p>

My name is Gareth Gaudin and I am a cartoonist in Victoria, BC Canada and I've worked in a comic book store for 25 years. Three days ago, a woman came into my shop with the most beautiful copy of Amazing Fantasy #15 that I've ever seen.

She had bought it as a teenager in the eighties for under five hundred dollars and it seems that now was the time to set it free. My first step (there was not much I could do while she was standing in front of me with it) was putting a photo on Instagram, asking if anybody had an extra five hundred thousand dollars on hand. She said ""No, ask a MILLION"" (I put half a million). It's a crazy amount of money either way.</p><p> </p><p>Within hours, I got a call from a reporter named Lauren Boothby (from a local newspaper called Victoria News) who came down to do a piece on it: <a href=""http://www.vicnews.com/news/rare-1-million-firs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.vicnews.com/news/rare-1-million-firs</a>...<br/><br/>First thing the next morning, however, my phone started really ringing! I had four film crews at my shop by mid afternoon and by the end of the day I'd been interviewed seven times.

these who help fund the book here on kickstarter, I will also sell the 
extra books at conventions. I'm also lucky enough to live in a large

fell and the great Gods rule Olympias. But this world is no different 
then our own, the people are just as obsessed with social media and 
celebrities just as ever! So it's no guess that the Gods themselves take
 just as much interest and amusement in the lives of humans. In 
Venus as a Boy we follow the adventure of a group of fangirls after they
 get mixed up in the kidnapping of two very famous celebrates. But they 
have the deal with more then just evil fangirls as they get mixed up in a
 far more larger plot being pulled by the Gods and gain control of 
magical jewels. Venus as a Boy is a serial comic with at the moment 15 issues planned. 
But of course that can change as I flesh out the story. In the mean time
 I want to start off with the print of the first issue! Lost at Sea. A 
16 page comic (+ covers and fun stuff) that will introduce everyone to 
most of the characters and begin their journey. If this fundrasier is 
successful I will then start another to print the second issue! This story is one that's been growing in my head for quite a while. 
After I found a style that suited the writing style I began working on 
it digitally. It would be a great accomplishment to get the whole series
 completed and published! Aside from sending the book out to all 
these who help fund the book here on kickstarter, I will also sell the 
extra books at conventions. I'm also lucky enough to live in a large 
city of New York which is an active hub of comics. I also plan on 
physically visiting comic shops throughout the city to directly sell 
copies to be put on shelves! By selling these comics I not only fund the
 rest of the series, but my artistic/comic career in general!It may seen like a lot to ask but 90% of the funds from my goal amount is going to be used to send the comic for print. The other 10% goes to making your rewards and shipping cost. My

<p class=""p1""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kuzimu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Indiegogo-header.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p class=""p1"">Kuzimu is a horror comic book about the realm of the dead and the consequences of a single life across time. Once a Maasai shaman, Pt'eros must face the truth of his existence to find peace and escape the afterlife. It is a dream-like book filled with interpretive visuals, symbolism and fantastically weird beings.<strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">It was first self-published as a webcomic, then as the first independent comic published through Graphicly's digital platform. Now this year it is being released as 194-page full colour graphic novel (paperback) by indie publisher 215 Ink, in stores and at Baltimore/New York Comic Con.</p>
<p class=""p2"">I am looking to raise $1750 for travel to and accommodation in New York for Saturday 13th and Sunday 14th October.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong> </strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kuzimu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Help-header.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">I have 3 other Kuzimu Graphic Novels planned and would love to have the full story see the light of day. Naturally, this depends on not only sales of the book but also awareness of it. If there is a perfect place to do this, it is at Comic Con, where I can turn the press, fans and comics professionals onto my work.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Getting a comic to this stage largely on my own has taken a toll on personal finances, relationships and my health to a degree. It is make or break time to take it to a higher level.</p>
<p class=""p2"">I need some help to raise the money to get me and my pencils to the next step toward a career in comics.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>GREAT AND PRECIOUS THINGS FOR YOUR SUPPORT</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kuzimu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Things-header.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">This book has been a personal journey for me. Having created the main characters at 15 and then developing the book for the last six years, this will be the culmination of about half my life.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Because this means so much, I promise to repay each contribution in some personalised way.</p>
<p class=""p2"">All funders will be mentioned in the next issue of Kuzimu (no 8), which is scripted and should be ready for release Winter 2012/13. Mid level perks get you a signed copy of the book 'Kuzimu Volume 1' with a personal message from me (you can ask for something specific). Higher level perks get you a unique inked or coloured sketch of any character you like (as specific as you please, it is up to you).</p>
<p class=""p2"">The most precious thing I can offer at the highest levels of funding is a piece of original inked artwork from my book. Every page is like a baby to me, but getting the work out there is so much more important!</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>SPECIAL OFFER FOR COMIC CON ATTENDEES (AT 215 INK'S BOOTH 2279):</strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kuzimu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Comic-con-header.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">As the event itself is the goal of this campaign, if you're going to New York I can do something a little extra for you.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Each mid to high-level perk contains the option to have it shipped to you, or to collect it from me personally on Saturday 13th/Sunday 14th October from my publisher 215 Ink's booth (number above). You can even let me know whether you want me pre-prepare it or if you want me sign your book etc. and draw your sketch on the day!</p>
<p class=""p2"">Two of the basic mid-level perks are specifically set up for this. One is cheaper to allow for collection at the con and the other adds international shipping. all higher level perks allow for shipping.</p>
<p class=""p2""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE IS VITAL</strong></p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.kuzimu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Any-help-header.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">It's a tough time and a tough world out there. I understand that you might not have money to give. But you can still help me if you believe in my work. Please help spread the world on Twitter, Facebook, your blog or anywhere your friends are via a direct link or the share buttons.</p>
<p class=""p2"">If you're not convinced, here's some kind words said about the book:</p>
<p class=""p3"">'<em>Kuzimu</em> isn’t quite like any comic I’ve come across before.' - Comics Bulletin</p>
<p class=""p3"">'The experience of reading an epic such as Kuzimu changes you a little...</p>

Kuzimu is a horror comic book about the realm of the dead and the consequences of a single life across time. Once a Maasai shaman, Pt'eros must face the truth of his existence to find peace and escape the afterlife. It is a dream-like book filled with interpretive visuals, symbolism and fantastically weird beings.
It was first self-published as a webcomic, then as the first independent comic published through Graphicly's digital platform. Now this year it is being released as 194-page full colour graphic novel (paperback) by indie publisher 215 Ink, in stores and at Baltimore/New York Comic Con.
I am looking to raise $1750 for travel to and accommodation in New York for Saturday 13th and Sunday 14th October.
 
WHY I NEED YOUR HELP

I have 3 other Kuzimu Graphic Novels planned and would love to have the full story see the light of day. Naturally, this depends on not only sales of the book but also awareness of it. If there is a perfect place to do this, it is at Comic Con, where I can turn the press, fans and comics professionals onto my work.
Getting a comic to this stage largely on my own has taken a toll on personal finances, relationships and my health to a degree. It is make or break time to take it to a higher level.
I need some help to raise the money to get me and my pencils to the next step toward a career in comics.
 
GREAT AND PRECIOUS THINGS FOR YOUR SUPPORT

This book has been a personal journey for me. Having created the main characters at 15 and then developing the book for the last six years, this will be the culmination of about half my life.
Because this means so much, I promise to repay each contribution in some personalised way.
All funders will be mentioned in the next issue of Kuzimu (no 8), which is scripted and should be ready for release Winter 2012/13. Mid level perks get you a signed copy of the book 'Kuzimu Volume 1' with a personal message from me (you can ask for something specific). Higher level perks get you a unique inked or coloured sketch of any character you like (as specific as you please, it is up to you).
The most precious thing I can offer at the highest levels of funding is a piece of original inked artwork from my book. Every page is like a baby to me, but getting the work out there is so much more important!
 
SPECIAL OFFER FOR COMIC CON ATTENDEES (AT 215 INK'S BOOTH 2279):

As the event itself is the goal of this campaign, if you're going to New York I can do something a little extra for you.
Each mid to high-level perk contains the option to have it shipped to you, or to collect it from me personally on Saturday 13th/Sunday 14th October from my publisher 215 Ink's booth (number above). You can even let me know whether you want me pre-prepare it or if you want me sign your book etc. and draw your sketch on the day!
Two of the basic mid-level perks are specifically set up for this. One is cheaper to allow for collection at the con and the other adds international shipping. all higher level perks allow for shipping.
 
ANY HELP YOU CAN GIVE IS VITAL

It's a tough time and a tough world out there. I understand that you might not have money to give. But you can still help me if you believe in my work. Please help spread the world on Twitter, Facebook, your blog or anywhere your friends are via a direct link or the share buttons.
If you're not convinced, here's some kind words said about the book:
'Kuzimu isn’t quite like any comic I’ve come across before.' - Comics Bulletin
'The experience of reading an epic such as Kuzimu changes you a little...
Brett has opened my eyes to a different type of storytelling.' - Randy Haldeman, This isn't Work
'A cool looking comic' - Jeff Lemire

<p>Monsters, ghosts, and murderers, oh my! You will find all that and more in the <em>Skin Crawling Comics Anthology.</em> From giant cockroaches, to vampire-victim support groups, to killer garden gnomes, <em>Skin Crawling Comics</em> offers tales of the grotesque and the macabre to give the readers a unique taste of terror.</p>

<p><em>""Hunger"", artist Sarah Elkins. See Perks.</em><em>  </em></p>
<p><em>Skin Crawling Comics</em> is a 180 page, color horror anthology comic book that draws inspiration from the spooky storytelling styles of classics like <em>Creepy, Eerie, </em>and<em> Tales from the Cry</em><em>pt. Skin Crawling Comics</em> will appropriate for readers ages 16 and up.</p>
<p><em>Skin Crawling Comics</em> is designed with the creepy in mind and rejects the idea of ""splatter porn"" as a substitute for storytelling. This doesn't mean we don't get gruesome, just that we do so with a purpose.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>All of the work required to create <em>Skin Crawling Comics</em> is already complete. We just need an infusion of capital to actually print and manufacture the finished product. Our goal is to raise $18,000 to make <em>Skin Crawling Comics</em> a reality. The costs break down to:          </p>
<p><span>1) Printing = $6,000</span></p>
<p><span>2) Shipping = $10 - $25 per book, depending on the destination. Overseas shipping is available.</span></p>
<p><span>3) Costs of Perks = $2,500</span></p>
<p><span>4) Cushion = IndieGoGo takes a 4% commission, and expenses tend to increase unexpectedly, so we're building a safety net into the campaign itself.</span></p>
<p><span>5) Page Rate for Contributors = Paying the artists for their contributions. If we meet our goal, not only do the pledgers get a wonderful book but the 40 creators who made <em>Skin Crawling</em> possible get a very modest page rate for their hard work.</span></p>

You will find all that and more in the Skin Crawling Comics Anthology. From giant cockroaches, to vampire-victim support groups, to killer garden gnomes, Skin Crawling Comics offers tales of the grotesque and the macabre to give the readers a unique taste of terror.

""Hunger"", artist Sarah Elkins. See Perks.  
Skin Crawling Comics is a 180 page, color horror anthology comic book that draws inspiration from the spooky storytelling styles of classics like Creepy, Eerie, and Tales from the Crypt. Skin Crawling Comics will appropriate for readers ages 16 and up.
Skin Crawling Comics is designed with the creepy in mind and rejects the idea of ""splatter porn"" as a substitute for storytelling. This doesn't mean we don't get gruesome, just that we do so with a purpose.
 
""F.V.K."", artist Sha-Nee Williams. See Perks.
What We Need & What You Get


All of the work required to create Skin Crawling Comics is already complete. We just need an infusion of capital to actually print and manufacture the finished product. Our goal is to raise $18,000 to make Skin Crawling Comics a reality. The costs break down to:          
1) Printing = $6,000
2) Shipping = $10 - $25 per book, depending on the destination. Overseas shipping is available.
3) Costs of Perks = $2,500
4) Cushion = IndieGoGo takes a 4% commission, and expenses tend to increase unexpectedly, so we're building a safety net into the campaign itself.
5) Page Rate for Contributors = Paying the artists for their contributions. If we meet our goal, not only do the pledgers get a wonderful book but the 40 creators who made Skin Crawling possible get a very modest page rate for their hard work.

 
What if the Artist or Podcast Perks Run Out?
IndieGoGo will only allow 20 active perks. As soon as one sells out another will rise up like a zombie horde. 
                                  
""Wesley"", artist Aaron Hazouri. To get in on the zombie action see the Return of the Living Dead perk or the Retailer perk.
 
Stretch Goals
If we surpass our goal then eveyone that pledged enough to receive a physical copy of the book (or more) will be automatically eligible for extras if the following funding levels are reached:

$30,000 = A signed, original print by artist Alex Sauvik, created specifially for Skin Crawling.
$50,000 = A limited, hardcover edition of Skin Crawling Comics, available only through the IndieGoGo campaign.

 
Make an Impact
In order to get published one has to be published. Confusing, I know, but Skin Crawling hopes to help out 40 creators with that problem. Skin Crawling Comics not only brings back spooky storytelling, it works as a portfolio piece for the creators involved.

It does so with equal doses of hilarity and mind
numbing horror.The main story follows Jackal Black, a cynical and sarcastic young man as he is yanked from his dull life into the bizarre dreamtime; a transit hub between dimensions.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Dhalmun is a mix of different ideas I decided to put together and make one, hopefully consistent, world. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I started working on ""Dhalmun: Age of Steam"" sometime in 2010. Didn't get too far with that one, though. After that, in summer of 2011, I launched a webcomic ""Dhalmun: Age of Smoke"" and it has been my main project since.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>""Age of Steam""</strong> is a story trying to go back to the roots of heroic/superheroic characters, connect with characters like Zorro, Robin Hood or the Four Musketeers. Maybe with a slightly darker tone. I wouldn't call it a steampunk comic, even though, as the title suggests, the steam-based technology is a major part of that world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>""Age of Smoke""</strong> is a story set in the same world, generations later. As AoS deals with the beginning of a superhero era, this one deals with its end. Now, people with powers don't seem to be as good as they used to be. Or maybe they just have more power.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>""Dhalmun: Age of Smoke"" is available to read <a href=""http://komiksbiram.blogspot.com/p/age-of-smoke.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a></strong>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since I've been posting stuff for free on the Internet, naturally I have no money (shocking, I know). I work on an 8-year old computer (which is fine, except for the fact that I live in constant fear of it breaking down), and I have no marketing skills (which raises a question of how in the hell am I going to promote this campaign).</div>
<div>I'm doing all this by myself and I want to be able to focus on the work that is to be done. And I guess this is where you guys can help.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you contribute $1, you get digital copies of both ""Age of Steam"" short stories, ""Age of Smoke"" #1-4 (which will be also published <a href=""http://komiksbiram.blogspot.com/p/age-of-smoke.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online</a>), ""Dhalmun: Lesser Evil"" #1. You also get whatever gets unlocked in the <strong>GOAL PACK.</strong>
</li>

<div> </div></div>","Short Summary
Dhalmun is a mix of different ideas I decided to put together and make one, hopefully consistent, world. 
 
I started working on ""Dhalmun: Age of Steam"" sometime in 2010. Didn't get too far with that one, though. After that, in summer of 2011, I launched a webcomic ""Dhalmun: Age of Smoke"" and it has been my main project since.
 

""Age of Steam"" is a story trying to go back to the roots of heroic/superheroic characters, connect with characters like Zorro, Robin Hood or the Four Musketeers. Maybe with a slightly darker tone. I wouldn't call it a steampunk comic, even though, as the title suggests, the steam-based technology is a major part of that world.
 

""Age of Smoke"" is a story set in the same world, generations later. As AoS deals with the beginning of a superhero era, this one deals with its end. Now, people with powers don't seem to be as good as they used to be. Or maybe they just have more power.
 

""Dhalmun: Age of Smoke"" is available to read here.
 
Since I've been posting stuff for free on the Internet, naturally I have no money (shocking, I know). I work on an 8-year old computer (which is fine, except for the fact that I live in constant fear of it breaking down), and I have no marketing skills (which raises a question of how in the hell am I going to promote this campaign).
I'm doing all this by myself and I want to be able to focus on the work that is to be done. And I guess this is where you guys can help.  
 

What We Need & What You Get

If you contribute $1, you get digital copies of both ""Age of Steam"" short stories, ""Age of Smoke"" #1-4 (which will be also published online), ""Dhalmun: Lesser Evil"" #1. You also get whatever gets unlocked in the GOAL PACK.

If you contribute $5, you get all of the above plus ""Dhalmun - Mythology"", a short, illustrated summary of the myths and gods of Dhalmun.
If you contribute $20, you get the above and a digital, hi-res (300dpi) sketch/speedpainting of a Dhalmun character of your choosing
If you contribute $50, you get the $5 perk plus a detailed digital painting of a chosen character/location from Dhalmun

THE GOAL PACK
If the campaign reaches these goals, i'll be able to make more work, and each of the contributors will get it:



If the campaign reaches $1400, the pack will contain a short ""The Cleaning Lady""


If the campaign reaches $2000, the pack will also contain ""Dhalmun: Lesser Evil"" #2


If the campaign reaches $3000, the pack will also contain ""Dhalmun: Age of Steam"" #1


 
So, the more money this campaign makes, the more each one of you gets. Sounds good?

<div>
<p>This a story for all generations of Star Wars fans and all parents of children who love Superheroes, but want less screen time and less bombastic violence for their young kids.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> </div><h3>Greetings Everyone!</h3><div>
</div><p>  My name is Brady, and I've been working for the last ten years to bring to life an epic horror series that, in my hopes, will revitalize the werewolf-horror subgenre. I've written three novels, The Book of Gray, The Book of Gray: To Live and Die, and The Book of Gray: Of Sand and Ash. With the help of my good friends over at Studio Ronin, I wish to translate this action-horror franchise into beautifully mastered Graphic Novels that everyone can enjoy! </p><div>
</div><p>  I've been an artist and a writer all my life, with a large collection of passion projects that I've been dying to get off the ground. You can see my work over at <a href=""http://www.bradygoldsmith.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bradygoldsmith.com</a>, or, <a href=""http://www.thebookofgray.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thebookofgray.com</a>. There, you will find everything that I've done, including the extensive art that I have produced in regards to The Book of Gray, as well as the art that Studio Ronin has already begun producing. </p><div>
</div><p>  You may be asking, $50,000.00 seems like an awful lot for a Graphic Novel? You're right, but let's look at why, because it's an extremely valid question. Studio Ronin is one of the industry leaders in traditional Graphic Novel art, meaning, everything that is done is hand painted and then mastered digitally. Personally, the style that they offer is a perfect fit for a horror Graphic Novel such as this, and they're the only one's I want behind the brush. </p><div>
</div><p>  Studio Ronin, and that of Christopher Shy, were responsible for the epic Dead Space Graphic Novel, based on the EA Video Game, as well as the popular Graphic Novels I Sleep in Stone and Man of Leaves. You may also recognize their work from the iconic album cover for Coheed and Cambria, Good Apollo Vol 1. Christopher of Studio Ronin is THE artist on The Book of Gray.</p><div>
</div><p>  50k, at minimum, will fund the project to completion. What does that mean? A 220-250 page full color Graphic Novel. Yes, that is correct, 220-250 pages. This isn't a comic book, but a full length Graphic Novel, and I can promise that it will be filled with the following:<br/><br/>1. An extremely realistic approach to the genre<br/>2. A dark atmosphere<br/>3. Dead things<br/>4. Bloody werewolf transformations<br/>5. Brutal werewolf on werewolf action<br/>6. Immersive plot and characters</p><div>
</div><p>  Back to the point! 50k will allow me to pay my artist in full to complete The Book of Gray. Any additional funds will help boost our ability to print and produce, ship product, and further dive into the second Graphic Novel, The Book of Gray: To Live and Die. (Which we really, REALLY want to get to because it takes place in WW2) </p><div>
</div><p>  It is my goal to make The Book of Gray Graphic Novel something memorable, something iconic, something dark and gritty and real- but most of all, something that will give horror fans exactly what they've been wanting to see from a killer werewolf saga. </p><p><br/></p><div>
</div><h3>Short Summary about The Book of Gray</h3><div> </div><p>  You can find everything about The Book of Gray, and it's sequels, on my website listed above. But, here's a short story synopsis of The Book of Gray, which will be the focal point of Graphic Novel!<br/></p><p>
</p><p>  ""Skonar Gray, a young boy from Romania (1831), finds
himself in a world of darkness and mystery. Amidst the innocence of first love
and the hope of a better life, the decadent layers of his existence start to
unravel around him. Creatures prowl the forests around his home and his family
hides a dangerous secret. Segregated and alone, Skonar will soon come to find
that the secret lurking within the
walls of his home is unescapable.</p><div>
</div><p>  What causes the maddening pains, the nightmares,
and the dead to come beckoning? What is the reason behind the horrors of his
father’s demands and his brother’s violence, the blood, and the changing coming
from within? Only words from a book, written ages ago and lost within the
depths can help Skonar to understand who and what he really is. But most of
all, how he can change who he is to become in order to face a condemned world.</p><div>
</div><p>  The past, the present, and the future, will
collide as Skonar embarks on a journey that will change everything.”</p><p><br/></p><p></p><div>
</div><h3>What we need and what you get</h3><div>
</div><div> </div><p>  We're going to keep it simple. The absolute minimum we need to create this Graphic Novel with Studio Ronin is 50k. All of the money received from this fundraising campaign will go directly to funding the artist, Christopher Shy, printing, and shipping. Every last penny of this campaign is going to the creation of this Graphic Novel. Please note, this is an ALL OR NOTHING campaign. We cannot do this without the support of all of you! If we make our goal, then we are eternally indebted to you for your contributions, and will send you cool stuff, as well as include your name as a special thank you in the final Graphic Novel! Anything above and beyond our goal will only make our job easier, get everything printed, and, also help us dive right into The Book of Gray: To Live and Die. If we do NOT make our goal, all donations will be refunded back to you.</p><p>  What do you get? </p><p>  One thing we will guarantee is that each and every person responsible for helping this Graphic Novel come to be will be thanked by name. But, we do have some exciting perks, such as signed prints and posters. We honestly don't have a lot to work with, but we want to make sure that all of you are apart of this project and forever recognized for it. This entire thing is in your hands. In the end, we're hoping that it isn't just about a Graphic Novel, but a following, in support of something truly great.</p><p><br/></p><div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every little bit helps. Our entire goal depends on your support! No pressure!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The team that we have is limited, which is why we need your help! As long as we can get the funding, we can easily produce our first Graphic Novel within 9-12 months.

</div></div>","Greetings Everyone!
  My name is Brady, and I've been working for the last ten years to bring to life an epic horror series that, in my hopes, will revitalize the werewolf-horror subgenre. I've written three novels, The Book of Gray, The Book of Gray: To Live and Die, and The Book of Gray: Of Sand and Ash. With the help of my good friends over at Studio Ronin, I wish to translate this action-horror franchise into beautifully mastered Graphic Novels that everyone can enjoy! 
  I've been an artist and a writer all my life, with a large collection of passion projects that I've been dying to get off the ground. You can see my work over at www.bradygoldsmith.com, or, www.thebookofgray.com. There, you will find everything that I've done, including the extensive art that I have produced in regards to The Book of Gray, as well as the art that Studio Ronin has already begun producing. 
  You may be asking, $50,000.00 seems like an awful lot for a Graphic Novel? You're right, but let's look at why, because it's an extremely valid question. Studio Ronin is one of the industry leaders in traditional Graphic Novel art, meaning, everything that is done is hand painted and then mastered digitally. Personally, the style that they offer is a perfect fit for a horror Graphic Novel such as this, and they're the only one's I want behind the brush. 
  Studio Ronin, and that of Christopher Shy, were responsible for the epic Dead Space Graphic Novel, based on the EA Video Game, as well as the popular Graphic Novels I Sleep in Stone and Man of Leaves. You may also recognize their work from the iconic album cover for Coheed and Cambria, Good Apollo Vol 1. Christopher of Studio Ronin is THE artist on The Book of Gray.
  50k, at minimum, will fund the project to completion. What does that mean? A 220-250 page full color Graphic Novel. Yes, that is correct, 220-250 pages. This isn't a comic book, but a full length Graphic Novel, and I can promise that it will be filled with the following:1. An extremely realistic approach to the genre2. A dark atmosphere3. Dead things4. Bloody werewolf transformations5. Brutal werewolf on werewolf action6. Immersive plot and characters
  Back to the point! 50k will allow me to pay my artist in full to complete The Book of Gray. Any additional funds will help boost our ability to print and produce, ship product, and further dive into the second Graphic Novel, The Book of Gray: To Live and Die. (Which we really, REALLY want to get to because it takes place in WW2) 
  It is my goal to make The Book of Gray Graphic Novel something memorable, something iconic, something dark and gritty and real- but most of all, something that will give horror fans exactly what they've been wanting to see from a killer werewolf saga. 
Short Summary about The Book of Gray   You can find everything about The Book of Gray, and it's sequels, on my website listed above. But, here's a short story synopsis of The Book of Gray, which will be the focal point of Graphic Novel!
  ""Skonar Gray, a young boy from Romania (1831), finds
himself in a world of darkness and mystery. Amidst the innocence of first love
and the hope of a better life, the decadent layers of his existence start to
unravel around him. Creatures prowl the forests around his home and his family
hides a dangerous secret. Segregated and alone, Skonar will soon come to find
that the secret lurking within the
walls of his home is unescapable.
  What causes the maddening pains, the nightmares,
and the dead to come beckoning? What is the reason behind the horrors of his
father’s demands and his brother’s violence, the blood, and the changing coming
from within? Only words from a book, written ages ago and lost within the
depths can help Skonar to understand who and what he really is. But most of
all, how he can change who he is to become in order to face a condemned world.
  The past, the present, and the future, will
collide as Skonar embarks on a journey that will change everything.”
What we need and what you get
   We're going to keep it simple. The absolute minimum we need to create this Graphic Novel with Studio Ronin is 50k. All of the money received from this fundraising campaign will go directly to funding the artist, Christopher Shy, printing, and shipping. Every last penny of this campaign is going to the creation of this Graphic Novel. Please note, this is an ALL OR NOTHING campaign. We cannot do this without the support of all of you! If we make our goal, then we are eternally indebted to you for your contributions, and will send you cool stuff, as well as include your name as a special thank you in the final Graphic Novel! Anything above and beyond our goal will only make our job easier, get everything printed, and, also help us dive right into The Book of Gray: To Live and Die. If we do NOT make our goal, all donations will be refunded back to you.  What do you get?   One thing we will guarantee is that each and every person responsible for helping this Graphic Novel come to be will be thanked by name. But, we do have some exciting perks, such as signed prints and posters. We honestly don't have a lot to work with, but we want to make sure that all of you are apart of this project and forever recognized for it. This entire thing is in your hands. In the end, we're hoping that it isn't just about a Graphic Novel, but a following, in support of something truly great.   The Impact
Every little bit helps. Our entire goal depends on your support! No pressure!

  Risks & Challenges  The team that we have is limited, which is why we need your help! As long as we can get the funding, we can easily produce our first Graphic Novel within 9-12 months. That will be the general turn around for completion. Studio Ronin, and that of Christopher Shy, works by hand with a paint brush doing what he does best. Each and every panel, page, and spread of this Graphic Novel will be a piece of art- which is the quality that we're looking for. Detail, story, and quality, is everything! We're already underway with getting The Book of Gray up and running, we just need your help to see it through to the end. Please, and thank you!   Other Ways You Can Help  If you can't contribute, please help us spread the word so we can get this project recognized! Our goal is to create a horror saga that will truly redefine the entire werewolf subgenre. Let's do that together!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><u><strong>Hypnos Synopsis</strong>;</u> <strong>Rodion</strong> was a convict. <strong>A serial killer with a death sentence</strong>. It seemed his fate had been already settled until <strong>he got a second chance to redeem his life</strong> and regain his freedom.</p>
<p>He was obligated to <strong>participate in</strong> a secret experimental program called <strong>""S.I.M.U.L.A.T.O.R"". A virtual reality supported by advanced AI designed to analyze and solve murder crimes.</strong> Throughout <strong>immersing in it,</strong> <strong>Rodion</strong> is supposed to <strong>encounter several murder cases</strong> which were <strong>committed by</strong> the most devious sadists in the history of mankind; <strong>Jack the Ripper, H.H.holmes … etc.</strong>. But things are much more complicated than they seem.</p>
<p>After some time, <strong>Rodion</strong> realizes that participation in ""S.I.M.U.L.A.T.O.R"" also has a price when he starts to <strong>experience amnesia and personality disturbances</strong>. However, even <strong>that is not his biggest problem,</strong> especially when he witnessed the <strong>AI concept of murder changes </strong><strong>to</strong><strong> not solve crimes but for studying the murder itself.</strong></p>
<p>Rodion discovers later that not everything he faces in the simulator is imagination, and <strong>the serial killers who are simulated by the artificial intelligence are more than just virtual projections or forgotten memories!</strong></p>

What is Znahar series?! What are Thanatos and Hypnos?!
Znahar series is a full detailed Comic about a supernatural world beyond our reach or understanding. Thanatos and Hypnos are parts of the series. Each part has a separate and a different story. Thanatos is the prequel of Hypnos.

Hypnos Synopsis; Rodion was a convict. A serial killer with a death sentence. It seemed his fate had been already settled until he got a second chance to redeem his life and regain his freedom.
He was obligated to participate in a secret experimental program called ""S.I.M.U.L.A.T.O.R"". A virtual reality supported by advanced AI designed to analyze and solve murder crimes. Throughout immersing in it, Rodion is supposed to encounter several murder cases which were committed by the most devious sadists in the history of mankind; Jack the Ripper, H.H.holmes … etc.. But things are much more complicated than they seem.
After some time, Rodion realizes that participation in ""S.I.M.U.L.A.T.O.R"" also has a price when he starts to experience amnesia and personality disturbances. However, even that is not his biggest problem, especially when he witnessed the AI concept of murder changes to not solve crimes but for studying the murder itself.
Rodion discovers later that not everything he faces in the simulator is imagination, and the serial killers who are simulated by the artificial intelligence are more than just virtual projections or forgotten memories!
Sample pages of Hypnos:​







Still, yet Hypnos and Thanatos have two separate stories, we must notify that the origin of The ""S.I.M.U.L.A.T.O.R"" was created in Thanatos, and Hypnos’ story depends on many facts that will be discussed in Thanatos.
A small overview of Thanatos; A grieving father, Isaac, finds out that his daughter died in a mysterious accident, has been brought back to life with a different name, Identity, and memory. He starts searching for answers to ultimately discover an illegal experimental program that mentions him as the first patient.
You can check the episodes released of Thanatos on webtoon.
