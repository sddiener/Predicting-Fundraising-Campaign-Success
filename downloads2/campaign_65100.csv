<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Short Story</h3>
<p>The SmarTHERM system has existed for more than 25 years now. The reason for its creation is that its founder built a large house in Quebec (Canada) in the early nineties. The house was equipped with a 25 KW/hr central electric heating system (furnace).  The winters being <u>rather cold</u> at north of the 49th parallel, the first electricity bills were very high (about $4500/yr, (60,000 KW/yr)).  So, being a long time software engineer, the founder believed at the time that a computer-based heating control system would do a better job to dramatically reduce the heating costs and increase the level of comfort of the occupants than any existing programmable thermostat.  So, an old TRS-80 Model I was brought to the rescue and this is how the SmarTHERM system came alive at the beginning.</p>
<p>At first, the system was very basic and the hardware interface was built on a small hard-wired ""breadboard"". But rapidly, the system evolved and was ported to an IBM PC-XT infrastructure, then an AT-286 infrastructure, a 386, a 486, and so on... By the same time, the system migrated from a DOS environment to a Windows 98, a Windows XP, and a Win 7 environment.  At a certain point, the breadboard was replaced by an ISA Printed Circuit Board (PCB), and more lately a PCI compliant PC Card.</p>
<p align=""center""><b>The system is now fully functional and has proved its point<br/>with energy savings of about 35% ! </b></p>
<p>Over the years and through its constant improvements, the system proved its robustness and its efficacy. Currently, the energy consumption of the above house has dropped to about 37,000 KW/yr and a heating cost of about $3200/yr despite the increased rates of energy over the years.</p>
<p>Often, visitors who had the chance to see the system in action ask us why we do not sell the system on the market.  During many years, we refused to bring to the market a product which was not perfect enough with regard to what we wanted it to accomplish.  But since a couple of years, the system has reached a level of completeness and robustness that brought us to envisage this possibility and we made some moves in that direction lately.  This campaign is a turning point towards that direction to bring the SmarTHERM system to the market.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Goal </h3>
<p>The goal of our campaign is to bring to the market our flagship project in which we invested thousands and thousands of hours in research and development over the last 25 years. At this time of its life cycle, the product has successfully passed all the preliminary phases of development and is market ready.</p>
<p>For now, our more specific goal is to manufacture a limited quantity of our SmarTHERM product, test them, sell them, receive feedback and comments about the product from our committed subscribers, make modifications where appropriate and launch a more widespread campaign in a second phase after this phase will have proven the robustness of the product in different house configurations.</p>
<p>It is very important for us to reach our campaign funding target because our campaign budget is based on the manufacturing of a number of units that will allow us to acquire parts, components, devices, etc. or to negotiate services at discounted volume prices and consequently, meet the unit cost on which our perks are based on.</p>
<b>What happens if we do not reach our Campaign goal? </b><p>We will make all possible efforts to make our campaign successful and we hope it will be, but if we don't reach our campaign funding target, we are prepared to fulfill our obligations even though this will mean we will probably have to ship some of our perks at loss. Even with a reduced number of units sold, <b>we think we will be able to reach most of the goals aimed by this campaign at this stage</b>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the SmarTHERM system has existed for more than 25 years and over time has successfully passed all the development phases of a project (concept, design, alpha, beta, prototype and fully functional system). At this time, the technological risks and challenges facing the SmarTHERM project are <b><u>very limited</u></b>.  </p>
<p align=""center""><b>The project is not a vague conceptual idea to be developed and realized.<br/>It is a <u>fully functional product</u>! </b></p>
<p>The system is made up of 3 main components:  the Software, a PC Card and the Weather Station.</p>
<p><b>The SOFTWARE:</b></p>
<p>The Software has completely been developed in-house and is probably the most robust and time-tested part of the system. Indeed, the software is at the heart of the system and as previously mentioned, the system has been in used for more than 25 years now. So, over the years, thousands and thousands of hours in development has been devoted to this part of the system including a lot of improvements, tuning, testing, etc. . As most software products, we know that there will always be improvements to come in future versions but taking into account its development state, there is absolutely <b><u>no risks attached to this part of the system</u></b>.</p>
<p align=""center"">N.B. You can check by yourself the SmarTHERM software performance by downloading a fully functional <b>DEMO</b> at the following address:<br/><a href=""http://sylver-tech.com/download.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sylver-tech.com/download.html</a></p>
<p><b>The PC Card:</b></p>
<p>At the beginning, this part of the system was developed in a ""lab"" mode, basically founded on a ""breadboard"" and manually hard-wired.  But as soon as this part of the system became relatively stable in terms of completeness and functionality, a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) was developed to support this fundamental part of the system. The first version of the PCB was an ISA PC Card and was totally designed in-house. Obviously, the manufacturing of the PCB has been outsourced to a specialized manufacturer, but at that time, the assembly of the components of the board was made in-house.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, given the phasing out of the ISA standard, we developed a PCI compliant PC Card.  The migration to this new and more demanding technology standard proved to be very challenging and required a lot of efforts but at the end, the SmarTHERM system now runs on this more flexible and open technology.</p>
<p>So, in terms of challenges, <b><u>this hardware part of the system is completely functional and does not require any modification now</u></b>. Moreover, in terms of risks, the manufacturing of this piece of hardware is outsourced to a specialized manufacturer, as well as the assembly of the components of the PCB which is more complex and demanding in the case of the PCI technology.  In short, <b><u>the risks related to this part of the system are very limited</u></b>!</p>
<p><b>The Weather Station:</b></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Weather Station is an important part of the system. It gathers all the outdoors sensors (temperature, wind, sunshine strength) required for the software to take its decisions based on the real actual on-site weather conditions.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the project, most of the sensors of the Weather Station were entirely home-made devices. But over time, we replaced them by sensors available on the market that we have adapted to our system. These sensors are largely available on the market and <b><u>so this part of the system does not constitute a risk either</u></b>.</p>

<p>The main element of the heat exchange device developed by us is a rotating multi-disk rotor. On one hand, disks rotate between the fins by which a heat source (or absorber) is equipped with. On the other hand, the multi-disk rotor is the element of the fan which is similar to Tesla’s turbine device. Unlike fan equipped with blades, disk fan can pump substantially large volumes of air and that provides excellent heating or cooling of disks which are intermediate heat carriers between the heat transfer fins of the heat source and air. The temperature of the disks which closed to pumped air, the relatively high rate of passage of disks between the fins, and the short distance between the disks and fins, together, provide enhanced heat transfer process.  </p>
<p>In fact, Tesla claimed that his turbine was the most efficient and the most simply designed rotary engine ever designed. Until today no one has refuted his claims!</p>

</div></div>","To be a happy companion, every dog needs home and loving owner. Most dogs prefer to rest after walk or play. However, if it’s too hot or too cold in the doghouse, their rest wouldn’t be that much relaxing.
Our solution: eegloo - small, very silent doghouse air conditioner. We are convinced every dog on the planet dreams about it. More than that, such an AC will help your pet stay healthy and active, isn’t it what you dream about?
Not only our AC controls the “weather” in your dog’s home, it cools or heats based on the current outside temperature. Our AC also removes excessive moisture, fine dust, and even bacteria all-together.
 

 

 

 

As a base for our invention, we took Nikola Tesla’s disc pump and then developed unique 2-in-1 node - heat exchanger and fan unit (patent pending). It has high heat exchange effectiveness, compact size and very low noise level during its operation.
There are plenty of applications for our invention - computer cooling, individual climate zones, air conditioning systems and etc. However as big dog lovers, we decided to start with a doghouse AC.
 
 

 

The main element of the heat exchange device developed by us is a rotating multi-disk rotor. On one hand, disks rotate between the fins by which a heat source (or absorber) is equipped with. On the other hand, the multi-disk rotor is the element of the fan which is similar to Tesla’s turbine device. Unlike fan equipped with blades, disk fan can pump substantially large volumes of air and that provides excellent heating or cooling of disks which are intermediate heat carriers between the heat transfer fins of the heat source and air. The temperature of the disks which closed to pumped air, the relatively high rate of passage of disks between the fins, and the short distance between the disks and fins, together, provide enhanced heat transfer process.  
In fact, Tesla claimed that his turbine was the most efficient and the most simply designed rotary engine ever designed. Until today no one has refuted his claims!
 

 


Dimensions (expected), LxWxH: 35x14x17 cm
Power supply: 12-15 VDC, 25 A
Cooling / Heating zone: up to 120x120x120 cm (50 cu ft)

 

 
You can install eegloo in three easy steps:

Make hole in doghouse wall
Install eegloo
Connect eegloo to the power source

 

 

 
Turn ON your eegloo by pushing button and set desired temperature. Period.
 

 
Q: What makes your AC unique?
A: Good question, additional to above features here are some highlights to help to answer it:
High efficiency of our heat exchanger allows us to reduce energy usage and expand AC operational temperature range, for example very cold or very hot weather;

Device monitors if pet is inside the doghouse and deactivates itself if not. OLED display indicates if pet is present;
​
 
It will heat up your pet in cold time and cool down in hot time;


Lifespan of our product is longer than average, thanks to the use of simple electronic thermoelectric elements;
eegloo is designed in a way it’s dust immune, which spares you time cleaning it.

​
Q: Is this good for pets?
A: We are glad you asked. Our device not only keeps optimal temperature range in the doghouse, but also removes moisture, ammonia, dust particles and even bacteria.

Q: Can I use it for cat?
A: Absolutely!!

<h3>Fully Autonomous</h3>
<p> While the ambient temperature is within the comfort zone, it idles, periodically checking the temperature. Once a decent amount of temperature differential is detected, it will cool or warm towards the ideal temperature by a few degree. When the occupancy is detected, it goes into a full cooling/warming mode with it's speed curve set by the animal's weight - the heavier the animal is, the harder it pushes to get to the optimal stage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473938628/bar9rvkkbohmqe8abiqb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> The occupancy pattern is learned and will prepare Aridus Den to react faster or be more energy efficient. If the animal does not come in for an extended period of time, it will go into different stages of energy savings mode, just like your laptop or a smartphone to save energy.</p>
<p> So whether the season has changed, or the animal has gone for a vacation, there is never a need to adjust temperature. Just plug in, and let them enjoy.</p>

<h3>(quiet)</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Most small animals- Cats, dogs, ferrets, and rabbits - have very sensitive ears. So we got rid of these - the noise, moving parts, and fans.</p>
<p>The result is silent operation. Even while it cools at full speed, to provide the most comfortable space for your loved one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473939002/lbrg3y9w5urxuzk4smsf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Efficiency</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Most air conditioners and heaters at households are convective. It means that they cool or warm the entire air in the space to get to your animal friend.</p>
<p>Aridus Den is conductive for both cooling and heating. In fact, it uses the same component for both cooling and heating, known as thermoelectric module. </p>
<p>The module heats and cools a panel of aluminum alloy, one of the most heat conductive element around us, and it spreads the temperature on the sitting surface evenly.</p>
<p>Stacked with it's smart energy control, leaving Aridus Den on at all times consumes only about the same amount of energy that a regular 60W light bulb would, if it was lit only for a few hours at night.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473939586/v74bwufqhnzq2nloz43b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Refrigerant-free</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlike a simple fan, Aridus Den can cool below room temperature. But it differs itself from an air conditioner or refrigerator in that it does not use any refrigerant.</p>
<p>Any of those gases - methyl chloride, CFC, HCFC, HFC - are not only toxic to animals and humans to inhale, but is also one of the main source of air pollution when escaped (and yes, they do escape over time).</p>
<p>As for you, You'd never need to call a mechanic to fix a refrigerant leak. For the animals, they will be intrinsically safe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473939948/e39ajcegdch1en3zkzob.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Emotional attachment</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We like to buy new things for them. A new warm pet bed for the winter, a new wooden house for the spring, a cooling pad for the summer.</p>
<p>We keep buying them, partially because they only work for a specific (narrow) temperature range, and also because your loved one simply does not recognize it as their home.</p>
<p>Aridus Den is the all-season solution that goes much cooler than what a cooling pad can handle on a hot summer day, and much warmer than a thick fluffy houses in a cold winter day. </p>
<p>A sensor monitors ambient temperature real time and another sensor locates millimeters beneath their body, to get the accuracy that a home thermostat can never achieve.</p>
<p>All-season also means that the house isn't getting replaced every few months, and that will grow an emotional attachment as their own private space that is always comfortable.</p>
<p>Moving every few months versus living in one house for years. Which would feel more like being at home?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473940031/jw8fsnxyhaqmyhqtppr6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Smart padding</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are using a type of gel that allows the aluminum panel to transfer heat more efficiently. At the same time, it will provide a soft cushion. The types of fabrics we are testing have a higher heat conductivity to make sure that we have a better communication with the animal's body temperature. They can easily be separated and washed, so your loved one won't have to share the bed with bugs and bacteria.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473940273/mjwpwrajdyib1sgnyol3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Don't chew worry</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Some animals will chew. We anticipate it. So we located the transformer right at the plug to make sure that even if they chew through the cord, the voltage running the cord is low enough not to harm them or to start fire.</p>
<p>And we are stepping further to sculpt and test various designs of the cord itself to be chew-proof in the first place.</p>
<p>We are still going though trials and errors, but it's only a matter of time until we find a form that fuses a great degree of safety and sound aesthetics.</p>

<h3>A den</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Small animals like small spaces. They like to fit themselves into boxes, sleep under the bed, hide in closets and hang inside a washing machine. Leaving them under a nine feet high ceiling designed for human makes them feel vulnerable. A house for them should just fit them. Like a den.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Q. What about my big dog?</p>
<p>A. We've already designed a larger version. But a large product requires a large amount of funding, so we are concentrating this smaller version at the time - we think a size that fits most every cats, small dogs, rabbits, and ferrets has a larger market. Help us take off, and we'll definitely make a larger version, bringing all the technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q. Supported voltage?</p>
<p>A. Current prototype only supports 120V for US. But there's plenty of transformers that supports 110V-277V universal input, so there's no reason we can't bring this to the rest of the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q. What's the processor like? Is this a computer?</p>
<p>A. It does compute, but it's not going to give you a friendly Windows blue screen. Depending on the production volume, we'll decide the specifics of electronic components. Current prototype uses Arduino based system with a few dedicated boards, but we are hoping to make everything into one chip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q. What color of the pad will I get? How soft is it?</p>
<p>A. We'll provide a variety of inner pad and the outer cover so you can mix and match. Specifics of it will depend on pricing and availability of the factories so we'll take a round of survey before we place the order. If you have an awesome idea, let us know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q. Can the ears and pad covers be used independently from Aridus Den?</p>
<p>A. The bottom of ears have curvature matching the outer diameter of Aridus Den so you can't really stick it to other surfaces. The covers can be put on something else, but we made it to have higher heat conductivity that you wouldn't want to use it separate from Aridus Den. All accessories are free of shipping, as we'll only ship these to the people who has an order of Aridus Den.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q. How much electricity will I save, compared to using an air conditioner and heater?</p>
<p>A. There are too many variables such as the size of the space they are in, leakage, climate of where you are at, and so on. But think of it this way. It should consume much less than an incandescent 60W light bulb in most every scenarios. And 60W is not a very bright one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q. Why such a slash of price?</p>
<p>A. Most, if not every, components of Aridus Den are mass-market friendly. The more we can produce, the cheaper it gets at a dramatic rate and in this campaign we are also skipping all the middle merchants other than Indigogo and Paypal each taking small fees. Besides, we really think that this is a product that will make it's early buyers to advocate. Let's disrupt the copy-and-paste pet house market that's filled with consumables. It's time we make something that the four-pawed users will like.</p>

(quiet)
 
Most small animals- Cats, dogs, ferrets, and rabbits - have very sensitive ears. So we got rid of these - the noise, moving parts, and fans.
The result is silent operation. Even while it cools at full speed, to provide the most comfortable space for your loved one.
 

 

Efficiency
 
Most air conditioners and heaters at households are convective. It means that they cool or warm the entire air in the space to get to your animal friend.
Aridus Den is conductive for both cooling and heating. In fact, it uses the same component for both cooling and heating, known as thermoelectric module. 
The module heats and cools a panel of aluminum alloy, one of the most heat conductive element around us, and it spreads the temperature on the sitting surface evenly.
Stacked with it's smart energy control, leaving Aridus Den on at all times consumes only about the same amount of energy that a regular 60W light bulb would, if it was lit only for a few hours at night.
 


 
Refrigerant-free
 
Unlike a simple fan, Aridus Den can cool below room temperature. But it differs itself from an air conditioner or refrigerator in that it does not use any refrigerant.
Any of those gases - methyl chloride, CFC, HCFC, HFC - are not only toxic to animals and humans to inhale, but is also one of the main source of air pollution when escaped (and yes, they do escape over time).
As for you, You'd never need to call a mechanic to fix a refrigerant leak. For the animals, they will be intrinsically safe.
 

 
Emotional attachment
 
We like to buy new things for them. A new warm pet bed for the winter, a new wooden house for the spring, a cooling pad for the summer.
We keep buying them, partially because they only work for a specific (narrow) temperature range, and also because your loved one simply does not recognize it as their home.
Aridus Den is the all-season solution that goes much cooler than what a cooling pad can handle on a hot summer day, and much warmer than a thick fluffy houses in a cold winter day. 
A sensor monitors ambient temperature real time and another sensor locates millimeters beneath their body, to get the accuracy that a home thermostat can never achieve.
All-season also means that the house isn't getting replaced every few months, and that will grow an emotional attachment as their own private space that is always comfortable.
Moving every few months versus living in one house for years. Which would feel more like being at home?
 

 
Smart padding
 
We are using a type of gel that allows the aluminum panel to transfer heat more efficiently. At the same time, it will provide a soft cushion. The types of fabrics we are testing have a higher heat conductivity to make sure that we have a better communication with the animal's body temperature. They can easily be separated and washed, so your loved one won't have to share the bed with bugs and bacteria.
 

 
Don't chew worry
 
Some animals will chew. We anticipate it. So we located the transformer right at the plug to make sure that even if they chew through the cord, the voltage running the cord is low enough not to harm them or to start fire.
And we are stepping further to sculpt and test various designs of the cord itself to be chew-proof in the first place.
We are still going though trials and errors, but it's only a matter of time until we find a form that fuses a great degree of safety and sound aesthetics.
 

 
A den
 
Small animals like small spaces. They like to fit themselves into boxes, sleep under the bed, hide in closets and hang inside a washing machine. Leaving them under a nine feet high ceiling designed for human makes them feel vulnerable. A house for them should just fit them. Like a den.
 

 
Ear accessories
Magnetic attachment allows free-positioning of these ears to make them even cuter.
 

 
 
Q&A
 
Q. What about my big dog?
A. We've already designed a larger version. But a large product requires a large amount of funding, so we are concentrating this smaller version at the time - we think a size that fits most every cats, small dogs, rabbits, and ferrets has a larger market. Help us take off, and we'll definitely make a larger version, bringing all the technology.
 
Q. Supported voltage?
A. Current prototype only supports 120V for US. But there's plenty of transformers that supports 110V-277V universal input, so there's no reason we can't bring this to the rest of the world. 
 
Q. What's the processor like? Is this a computer?
A. It does compute, but it's not going to give you a friendly Windows blue screen. Depending on the production volume, we'll decide the specifics of electronic components. Current prototype uses Arduino based system with a few dedicated boards, but we are hoping to make everything into one chip.
 
Q. What color of the pad will I get? How soft is it?
A. We'll provide a variety of inner pad and the outer cover so you can mix and match. Specifics of it will depend on pricing and availability of the factories so we'll take a round of survey before we place the order. If you have an awesome idea, let us know.
 
Q. Can the ears and pad covers be used independently from Aridus Den?
A. The bottom of ears have curvature matching the outer diameter of Aridus Den so you can't really stick it to other surfaces. The covers can be put on something else, but we made it to have higher heat conductivity that you wouldn't want to use it separate from Aridus Den. All accessories are free of shipping, as we'll only ship these to the people who has an order of Aridus Den.
 
Q. How much electricity will I save, compared to using an air conditioner and heater?
A. There are too many variables such as the size of the space they are in, leakage, climate of where you are at, and so on. But think of it this way. It should consume much less than an incandescent 60W light bulb in most every scenarios. And 60W is not a very bright one.
 
Q. Why such a slash of price?
A. Most, if not every, components of Aridus Den are mass-market friendly. The more we can produce, the cheaper it gets at a dramatic rate and in this campaign we are also skipping all the middle merchants other than Indigogo and Paypal each taking small fees. Besides, we really think that this is a product that will make it's early buyers to advocate. Let's disrupt the copy-and-paste pet house market that's filled with consumables. It's time we make something that the four-pawed users will like.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

Troubled Sleeping? Hyperhidrotic? Got the caffeine jitters? The SUNTQ weighted blanket, made of 100% polyester, adopting the latest technology, makes the blanket more chill than that made of bamboo. Some experts get the result after their research. The weighted blanket can make you feel secure, as if you’re being hugged,which helps you calm down and lulls you to sleep, says Chris Branter, a certified sleep science coach and founder of SleepZoo.com. As for why weighting blanket is effective, most of the benefits boil down to so-called “deep stress stimuli” or “deep stress treatments”—the kind of pressure that babies feel in their shackles, Branter explains. ""The researchers believe that stress will make you feel grounded in your sleep surface, reduce the secretion of stress hormone cortisol, which has a negative impact on melatonin production.Who should use a weighted blanket? Almost everyone can benefit from the use of weighted blankets.

We all love our cats, and have even learned to love the mischief they get up to. But one thing we can all agree on, is that we HATE cleaning the cat litter box. It is the one task that almost everyone tries to pass on to someone else in the house. That is why we created FlipMate! We want to make your life easier (including ourselves - we have many cats too) and take the hassle out of cleaning our beloved cat’s litter box.No more procrastinating until your cat becomes rebellious because FlipMate has made this dreaded chore the easiest task in the house. How FlipMate worksIt really is that simple! No more digging for clumps. No more wasted cat litter. No more mess.FlipMate saves you time and money so you can get back to laughing at your cat’s amusing antics even faster! 
FlipMate is versatileWe know that not all cats are the same. Some like to kick the litter out while digging and some cats likes to spray up high. For those cats, you can attach the litter guard to keep the mess off the floor.The lid is also completely removable when space is an issue, so you can keep the lid off the box until it is time to clean the litter box.You can also lay the lid flat and fix the litter guard to trap litter when your cat exits the box.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Welcome to YourBlunderBox .</h2>
<p>     I'm Jeff ,a father, inventor, patent holder, a master plumber and business owner for over 17 years.  I have had this idea for over 10 years due to the need i found while installing and repairing water damage caused by refrigerators  water lines leaking . Usually the damage is more severe because the line hides behind the refrigerator and leaks slowly until the water shows up else were.  Insurance claims average between $8,000 and $15,000 for kitchen appliance water line leaks. The time line from discovery to completion of repairs averages 14 days. Your support can help get this product manufactured here in the United states and help save thousands of home owners from refrigerator water leaks.</p>
<p>     To achieve our goals we will need to raise $27,000 . This will fund the injection mold production and  first run of approximately 2000 units including  shipping . I already have a manufacturer lined up that will make the mold and run production in house locally.</p>
<p>     The MSRP after the campaign will be $28.00 ,but if you contribute now you can pre order one at the low price of $20.00. Want more than one ? No problem each additional one bought at the same time can be had at $15.00 each ( must ship to same address as initial one) What a deal.</p>
<p>     If we don't reach our goal funds will be returned .</p>
<p>     Funding time line .. approximately 30 days after funding we  get mold made and start production run. Next 60 days we take possession of inventory and start shipping.</p>
<p>     Your help reaching this goal will allow the average person get an affordable product that can save them thousands in damage  and help prolong the life of the appliance. I have about 24 of these units installed locally . We already have 3d printed and field tested for proof of concept with no problems .  When shown to other plumbing professionals  the unit has been met with a lot of positive feed back. I personally have my retirement tied up in this project. Just so you know I have everything invested to make this a successful venture.</p>
<p>     If you like this product please invest with me to make it a reality. If an investment is not for you but you can see the value please share this campaign with friends and family. Thank you for your interest.</p>

excel tableMy storyMy name is Zoltan Szimeonov.I’m from Budapest, Hungary, and I’m an IT student in my final year of university.During my time at the university, my financial situation has varied a lot.At the beginning of my studies, I received money from my family from our home savings fund every month, and I had other support from my family and I also took out a student loan.Unfortunately, at this time I wasn’t really studying, I was just having fun, and by the time I started taking my studies seriously, the funds in the savings account and my family’s intention to help had run out.From that point on, I lived only on student loan, and at first this meant I had to live in extremely difficult circumstances.Later, making use of my interest in my profession and my skills, I created an Excel program for personal household budgeting.I wasn’t expecting much at first, but as I started using it, I was shocked to see that merely by organising my finances I could achieve as much change and stability in my quality of life as I could have with a large amount of money.When I didn’t have the table, I simply spent my money the way I wanted until it lasted, and, as a result, I spent huge amounts on things that were much less useful in my life compared to spending the same amount on housing fees or meals, or saving it for years to be able to buy a home one day.Moreover, less usefully spent amounts affected useful spendings directly.When I had a lot of money, but had no tables, plans or rules, I spent money on a lot of less useful, and a lot of useless things, and at the end of the month I was always short of cash, I was often late with my housing fees, and sometimes at the very end of the month, I could barely buy food.However, when I had just one third of the money, but I used my tables and had plans, I didn’t have these problems anymore.Most importantly, I didn’t feel a decrease in my quality of life that I would have expected based on the difference of the available amounts.The significance of adequate household records, in my experience, comes second, right after the most important factor, i.e. the amount available for the household.Even though money is a crucial question, and this is just a small table, it is rather important, so it is also important that this household planner should be as good and effective as possible.Recognising this, I wish to bring to the market my own, Excel-based household budgeting system that I have been developing for many years now, as I believe it will help a lot of households improve.Currently, there is only a Hungarian version. The aim now is to launch the Hungarian version, which will be followed by the development of the English and German versions of the planner in late 2018.This tool is basically used for optimizing resources, saving money is not the main point, it is just a part of the method.When set appropriately, the household planner helps you turn useless or less useful spendings into useful ones (e.g. a nice holiday, or your own home sometime in the future), while also providing a more stable framework for everyday life.This means the product can be useful for families and living communities, regardless of their financial situation.What do I need money for?Primarily, I need money for the AdWords campaign, as right now the major obstacle to sales is that the product is not known.In addition, there are other expenses related to further development, and later, once the enterprise is operational, I will need money for an office.Present plansAt present, the company’s foundation is in progress.The first major objective is the product launch of the Hungarian version, for which serious advertising (e.g. Adwords) is necessary.The version optimised for British and German conditions, with many extra functions, will be made and launched in the market following the success of this launch.With the English and German-language versions the target audience will be much larger, which requires a large initial advertising investment; this will be funded from the profit of the first basic version.There are further plans to develop many similar programs, e.g. to support the administration of studies, or the work and the income of entrepreneurs and freelancers.

</h2><p>LUMBIENT is a beautiful ceiling light with endless design possibilities. LUMBIENT's design flexibility, inspired by human diversity, allows you to show your unique taste and creativity.</p>
<p>LUMBIENT's design is simple: instead of using a single, fixed light shade like most pendants use, LUMBIENT has several light shades that come in different colors and sizes, and are easily replaceable. This lets you personalize LUMBIENT and 
create something that looks like it‘s yours, not someone else’s.</p><p>With 72 
positioning points, 4 different shade sizes, and 10 different shade 
colors* for you to choose from, 
the number of possible personalizing variations is one with 115 digits. 
For 
comparison, the count of atoms in the universe is estimated to be a 
number with only 80 digits! This makes the LUMBIENT that hangs in your 
own home or office most likely the only one in
the universe with <b>YOUR</b> specific personal combination.

 How cool is that?!</p><p>*This campaign starts with an offer of 7 colors.

<p>LUMBIENT was created to be environmentally friendly, because no matter how we 
look at it we have only one planet earth. For that, LUMBIENT is made out of
 environmentally safe materials that are easily recyclable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>LUMBIENT's body materials</b> - birch wood is biodegradable and 100% recyclable, polycarbonate is 100% recyclable. </li>
<li>
<b>LUMBIENT</b><b>'s leaves </b>- made of polypropylene which is so safe to use 
that it's a prime component in food containers. Polypropylene is also 
100% recyclable. </li>
</ul>
<p>
One aspect of environmentally friendly products is their life 
cycle: how simple is it to recycle a specific product? Does the product need extensive 
disassembly and material separation before it can be recycled? When 
designing LUMBIENT, I insisted on having no glue, bolts or welding
 points on the final product. This makes LUMBIENT not only easy and quick for you
 to assemble but also simple to disassemble and separate the different 
components for easier recycling. </p><br/>

</div></div></div>","INTRODUCING LUMBIENT
LUMBIENT is a beautiful ceiling light with endless design possibilities. LUMBIENT's design flexibility, inspired by human diversity, allows you to show your unique taste and creativity.
LUMBIENT's design is simple: instead of using a single, fixed light shade like most pendants use, LUMBIENT has several light shades that come in different colors and sizes, and are easily replaceable. This lets you personalize LUMBIENT and 
create something that looks like it‘s yours, not someone else’s.With 72 
positioning points, 4 different shade sizes, and 10 different shade 
colors* for you to choose from, 
the number of possible personalizing variations is one with 115 digits. 
For 
comparison, the count of atoms in the universe is estimated to be a 
number with only 80 digits! This makes the LUMBIENT that hangs in your 
own home or office most likely the only one in
the universe with YOUR specific personal combination.

 How cool is that?!*This campaign starts with an offer of 7 colors. Want more colors? - support LUMBIENT to help us reach our ""Additional Colors"" stretch goals!VERSATILITYLUMBIENT's design makes it easy to personalize so it fits many room designs, home interiors, and offices. For example:

Redecorating? Just replace the leaves in minutes to fit LUMBIENT to the new color scheme. 

Know anyone who is a sports fan? Get them a LUMBIENT with the colors of their favorite team.

Want to create a unified decorating scheme? Keep a consistent look throughout your home by
having multiple LUMBIENTs, each with a color scheme to fit your individual
room.


Decorating a kid's room? Don't worry about their changing taste over time. When time comes, simply replace LUMBIENT's leaves to fit their new taste.

LUMBIENT'S APPTo make personalizing LUMBIENT easy, I have created a web application. 
The app initially creates a random design, which is changeable up to the 
last detail meaning you are able to determine each 
leaf's position, color and size.Just try it out, it's cool! => LUMBIENT web application COMMITMENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT

<h4>Does BikeSys need a data connection to work?</h4>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Yes and No, BikeSys need data connection to send you theft warning, SOS message and unlock by BikeSys APP. It makes GPS more accurate also. But don’t worry about the data charge. BikeSys will only send message when you need. We commend getting a SIM with a pay-as-you-go plan, so you only end up paying for it when you see it. On the other hand, BikeSys works without SIM card if you don't need those functions. Proximity unlock will still work as it use BLE 4.0 but not data connection.</p>

<h3>Greetings!</h3>
<p>Welcome to the first crowdfunding campaign for the Internet Connection Informant, the ultimate broadband connection monitoring and management system.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A Quick List Of Features</h3>
<p>Informant is arguably the most comprehensive connection monitor and manager in its price range, with a feature set that goes on and on and on, but the first few features are probably the most critical:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Super Easy To Install.</strong> Informant's installation process is about as easy as it gets. Plug your modem's AC power cable or adapter into one outlet on the back of the unit, plug your router's power cable or adapter into the other outlet, connect a network cable from the unit to your router, and plug in Informant's power cable. Informant takes it from there.</li>
<li>
<strong>Super Easy To Use.</strong> Using Informant for its basic purpose doesn't require networking expertise. In fact, Informant was carefully designed to be as hands-off as possible. Of course, if you want to do more with Informant, you can, but that's entirely up to you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Totally Automatic Setup &amp; Operation.</strong> Informant automatically detects your networking equipment and where it resides on your network, automatically configures itself accordingly, and automatically begins testing; your first basic ""up/down"" connection test will happen within a few moments and your first comprehensive connection test will be on the next quarter-hour.</li>
<li>
<strong>Your Information Is Private.</strong> Informant does not send anything out aside from test data such as DNS lookup requests and ""pings."" Informant does not monitor anything done by the users on a network, only the Internet connection to and from the network. The testing system is open-source, so you can inspect the program code and see for yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>If those aren't already enough to invite contributing and picking a perk (or two or three), let's get into some of the good stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Quick Tests Every 30 Seconds.</strong> Informant will perform a simple ""is it up or not?"" test once every 30 seconds (by default), by performing a ""ping"" (ICMP ECHO request) against up to five ""ping""-friendly IP addresses. If this test fails, Informant logs the failure and restarts your modem and router.</li>
<li>
<strong>Comprehensive Tests Every 15 Minutes.</strong> Informant's comprehensive tests check for DNS lookup problems, slow website access, and also whether your modem and router are responsive or lagging. Results are recorded and reported.</li>
<li>
<strong>Latency/Route Monitoring.</strong> Informant can regularly test latency and routing (via ""ping"" and traceroute) up to 32 IP-address/port combinations. Know when a favorite game server, website, etc. is lagging or unreachable.</li>
<li>
<strong>Front-Panel OLED Display.</strong> See what Informant thinks of the connection, get status info, and see what the URL is for Informant's built-in website (next item!) directly from Informant.</li>
<li>
<strong>Built-In Mobile-Friendly Website.</strong> Informant includes a built-in web server, and the website it serves gives access to test results (see the next feature!), administration and configuration controls such as a one-click ""restart modem/router"" button, and more. Informant's website is also mobile-aware and responsive, so it works with almost any display size from mobile phone to 4K monitor and beyond.</li>
<li>
<strong>Charts! Charts Everywhere!</strong> Informant saves the results of up to 32,768 tests, and presents the data as charts. Check your connection's condition for the last 24 hours, last week, last month, or break tests down by the hour or day to see if your connection does strange things at specific times.</li>
<li>
<strong>Integrated Security.</strong> Informant does not send information outside your network except what it requires for testing, and its website won't allow access to outside IP addresses. As an additional safeguard, any device that wants to access administration and configuration controls must register itself with Informant by repeating a security code Informant will display, thus requiring direct physical access to the unit.</li>
<li>
<strong>Power Failure Detection and Recovery.</strong> Informant has its own internal power bank that allows the unit to detect a power failure, shut itself down gracefully, watch for the power to be restored, and restart everything once power has stayed up long enough to appear reasonably stable. All of this is automatic.</li>
<li>
<strong>No Subscriptions and No Apps Required.</strong> No monthly fees! We plan to offer additional services on a subscription basis at a later date, but these are entirely optional.</li>
<li>
<strong>Open-Source Testing Software.</strong> Informant's test scripts are written in Python and a programming API is provided. Inspect the program code yourself! Create your own tests! Try out tests written by others!</li>
<li>
<strong>Aggressive Attention To Safety.</strong> Informant includes a number of safeguards and fault detection systems for electrical safety, such as fused AC mains power input, industrial high-power relays, state-change lockouts, and AC mains voltage sensing. Informant also includes temperature sensing with overheat detection.</li>
<li>
<strong>Quiet Operation.</strong> With an aluminum chassis and fanless operation, Informant can reside quietly almost anywhere.</li>
<li>
<strong>We Support &amp; Encourage Right To Repair.</strong> Informant's schematics, diagnostic and repair information, and testing system source code will all be available from Informant's website, and spare/replacement parts will also be available to keep your Informant up and running.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>There's a lot more we can get into, as Informant's feature list is already extensive, and we plan to add more features and functionality during and after the campaign</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who Informant Is For</h3>
<p><strong>For Seniors</strong></p>
<p>Informant's ability to automatically detect and report connection problems, and automatically restart networking equipment as needed, makes modern Internet-connected life a lot easier for Seniors. No need for messing with power cables when something acts up!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For the Family IT Person</strong></p>
<p>If you're the ""computer person"" for your family, just imagine <i>never again</i> having to use the phrase ""did you try unplugging it and plugging it back in?"" Informant handles this for you. Plus, Informant supports VPN access, so you can reach into the family network from anywhere and monitor and/or manage the connection remotely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For Small Businesses</strong></p>
<p>Informant removes the need to babysit a company's broadband Internet connection. With a basic ""up/down"" test happening every 30 seconds (by default), Informant eliminates having to worry about unexpected downtime, or worse, not even knowing about the downtime for who knows how long. Stored test results make finding connection problems, and reporting them to your service provider, a lot easier.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For Travellers</strong></p>
<p>Let Informant keep your connection up and running while you're not there, so you can reach your home network's servers and services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For Everyone!</strong></p>
<p>If you have a broadband Internet connection, Informant is for you. Informant can work with cable, DSL, or fiber, and supports most of the ""officially supported"" broadband modems in use throughout North America.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This campaign is the gateway to our first production batch for Informant. As such, we've tried to do all of our homework to ensure minimum risk to all involved. Our target goal ensures that we can produce Informants in sufficient numbers to exploit the benefits of economy of scale and thus keep the per-unit production costs low enough to keep the asking price low, and this being a fixed-funding campaign means that we don't receive a cent unless we clear the cost hurdles from the very beginning.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>The process thus far:</p>
<ul>
<li>29 Mar 2017: The first fully-functional proof-of-concept codebase is developed.</li>
<li>14 Oct 2017: The first fully-functional prototype is built.</li>
<li>11 Feb 2018: The second fully-functional prototype is built.</li>
<li>5 Aug 2018: The third fully-functional prototype is built. (This is the demo model shown in this campaign.)</li>
<li>1 Oct 2018: This crowdfunding campaign begins.</li>
</ul>
<p>The process yet to come:</p>
<ul>
<li>November-December 2018: Development continues on a pre-production version, and tooling and equipment are acquired.</li>
<li>January-May 2019: Certification and safety testing are conducted on pre-production units, and the production design is finalized.</li>
<li>June 2019: Mass production begins.</li>
<li>July 2019: The first wave of completed units ship to backers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, the future plans are subject to change.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p><strong>$500,000 Goal</strong></p>
<p>If we reach this level, we'll design and offer three-outlet and four-outlet models in addition to this campaign's two-outlet. Control more devices from anywhere in your network!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$750,000 Goal</strong></p>
<p>If we reach this level, we'll design an additional model that can perform separate WiFi connection testing, and can restart a router or WAP as required using a third or fourth outlet. Test your wireless connection as well as your wired!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>$1,000,000 Goal</strong></p>
<p>If we reach this level, we'll expand Informant from North America AC mains power only to as many other countries as we can.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Of course we welcome any financial support you wish to give to our project. We also welcome any other forms of support you can offer, such as sharing this campaign on your social media accounts, or even telling friends and neighbors about that neat little box that resets your connection for you.</p>
<p>We even welcome the time you've spent reading our campaign information, and thank you for giving us a little bit of your day!</p>

Plus, Informant supports VPN access, so you can reach into the family network from anywhere and monitor and/or manage the connection remotely.
 
For Small Businesses
Informant removes the need to babysit a company's broadband Internet connection. With a basic ""up/down"" test happening every 30 seconds (by default), Informant eliminates having to worry about unexpected downtime, or worse, not even knowing about the downtime for who knows how long. Stored test results make finding connection problems, and reporting them to your service provider, a lot easier.
 
For Travellers
Let Informant keep your connection up and running while you're not there, so you can reach your home network's servers and services.
 
For Everyone!
If you have a broadband Internet connection, Informant is for you. Informant can work with cable, DSL, or fiber, and supports most of the ""officially supported"" broadband modems in use throughout North America.
 

Risks & Challenges
This campaign is the gateway to our first production batch for Informant. As such, we've tried to do all of our homework to ensure minimum risk to all involved. Our target goal ensures that we can produce Informants in sufficient numbers to exploit the benefits of economy of scale and thus keep the per-unit production costs low enough to keep the asking price low, and this being a fixed-funding campaign means that we don't receive a cent unless we clear the cost hurdles from the very beginning.
 
Timeline
The process thus far:

29 Mar 2017: The first fully-functional proof-of-concept codebase is developed.
14 Oct 2017: The first fully-functional prototype is built.
11 Feb 2018: The second fully-functional prototype is built.
5 Aug 2018: The third fully-functional prototype is built. (This is the demo model shown in this campaign.)
1 Oct 2018: This crowdfunding campaign begins.

The process yet to come:

November-December 2018: Development continues on a pre-production version, and tooling and equipment are acquired.
January-May 2019: Certification and safety testing are conducted on pre-production units, and the production design is finalized.
June 2019: Mass production begins.
July 2019: The first wave of completed units ship to backers.

Naturally, the future plans are subject to change.
 
Stretch Goals
$500,000 Goal
If we reach this level, we'll design and offer three-outlet and four-outlet models in addition to this campaign's two-outlet. Control more devices from anywhere in your network!
 
$750,000 Goal
If we reach this level, we'll design an additional model that can perform separate WiFi connection testing, and can restart a router or WAP as required using a third or fourth outlet. Test your wireless connection as well as your wired!
 
$1,000,000 Goal
If we reach this level, we'll expand Informant from North America AC mains power only to as many other countries as we can.

<li>Coordinating with manufacturers to evolve Fortigis from prototype to end product may be challenging.  We have prepared for this by speaking with the manufacturing companies ahead of time in order to get a clear idea of what the process will be like. In this way, most potential issues have already been assessed. Building computer hardware comes with its own inherent risks but given the experience and professionalism of our suppliers, we trust that there will be marginal unforeseen issues.<br/> </li>
<li>We need to optimize the applied software and apps. Our beta products are already equipped for that task, but over the next few months, we will have to improve the software in order to scale and support thousands of homes and connected devices. This is certainly a challenge, but one that we have had a collective hands-on experience to overcome. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520951622/uorlzforpszzrnsejmak.jpg"" src=""""/>

</ul><p><strong>How does the Fortigis protect users?</strong><br/>Fortigis is a cloud-enabled, privacy &amp; security wireless, VPN router that checks, controls and manages who connects to a user’s Wi-Fi network. In short, it works with your router to protect all your connected devices.</p><p><strong>Can something like a smart refrigerator or a smart teddy bear really be used to hack?</strong><br/>Yes and it’s not difficult! An 11-year-old in Austin, Texas used his teddy bear to hack into Bluetooth devices to manipulate a robotic teddy bear at a cybersecurity conference in the Netherlands.<br/><br/><strong>What could happen if I don’t protect my data and devices?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Your privacy being violated<ul><li>IP Cameras, smart TVs, voice assistants and other smart devices can lead to you being tracked, and having your personal and sensitive information held for blackmail</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Your Identity in someone else’s hands<ul><li>Laptops, desktops or storage devices can be hacked. Shopping from the privacy of your own home isn’t private if you aren’t protected.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Your home unlocked without permission<ul><li>Smart locks or doors hacked to open at the touch of a button</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Your family’s safety is in jeopardy<ul><li>Smart devices in your kitchen, heater, AC, CO monitoring can be hacked and turned off when you need it the most to survive.  Medical devices (e.g. insulin pumps) get hacked and your life is at the mercy of the adversaries!</li></ul>
</li>
<li>You unknowingly aid in a crime<ul><li>Your connected devices can be harnessed to commit a cyberattack against someone without your knowledge</li></ul>
</li>

In the wrong hands, they can also be used to steal, attack and invade your privacy, devices and data.And this is exactly why we made Fortigis.Fortigis protects you from online threats with an all-in-one package, that includes VPN, Firewall, Intrusion Prevention System, Antivirus, and Anti-malware.Fortigis allows you to control who is connected to your home network, alerts you when someone is trying to connect and informs you about your connected smart devices' activity.All these features are managed at your fingertips via an app available on web and mobile!Statistics are not in our favor, adversaries aren’t either!We want to safeguard ourselves and others. We’ve seen the impact of being unprotected first-hand and we’ve made it our mission to defend everyday people against online threats so that no more lives are affected.Installing Fortigis is easy and quick. Easy as 1-2-3 (with a happy bonus 4)!Adding New Devices - Whenever you add a new device to your network, Fortigis automatically identifies the type of connected device and assigns the relevant security profile without any configuration or downloading special software to the device. Fortigis is a powerful sentry protecting your castle with two incredible weapons at the ready:  the Virtual Private Network (VPN) and the patent-pending AI-powered security cloud. They are always working together in the background to create the ultimate in home (castle) network security.  The VPN - Cloak of PrivacyFortigis creates a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to give you online privacy and anonymity by creating a secure and private connection from your home network.                                                                                                                                           Having a VPN connection means that your actions on the internet are virtually untraceable. This protects you from being tracked and exploited online.  The secure connection encrypts all of your incoming and outgoing web traffic so no one, not even your internet provider, can see your online activity. It acts as the cloaking device that hides your IP address from the websites you visit and the services you use.The Power of the Security Cloud - The All Seeing WizardFortigis connects to a proprietary security cloud to create the VPN. This isn’t just any cloud,  it contains Fortigis’ patent-pending adaptive security system. This utilizes machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to powerfully protect your home network. Fortigis deploys real-time threat analysis and security scanning to make sure that all inbound and outbound traffic is always private and clean from any viruses, malware, ransomware, and other threats.A low-cost monthly subscription is necessary to take advantage of the AI-driven Cloud and the up to 200Mbps VPN. The subscription is in addition to the Fortigis device.Foritigis comes with a free app (iOS/Android/Web) that allows users to easily manage their network.  Through the app, you can confirm or deny access to anyone or anything trying to connect to your network. You can also monitor all relevant analytics for all of your devices and network.The app also provides real-time stats on connected devices such as average internet speeds, devices blocked, total threats and failed connection attempts. There is even a map of where the attacks are coming from.No need to hide your technology with the Fortigis!Strength and Beauty - Inspired by the fortifying bricks in castle walls and the clean complexity of the Rubik’s cube, the Fortigis is a patented work of art symbolizing both strength and beauty.Whisper Quiet - The Fortigis also has no moving parts, so will be whisper quiet while it stands in silence guarding your internet walls.Having worked at the enterprise security level for many years, we saw the good, bad and ugly of unsecured online networks. A tipping point for us was when Dyn, one of the largest DNS providers, was attacked by 100,000 hijacked smart devices (i.e. smart locks, lights, refrigerators, security cameras and more). That attack almost took down the entire internet.With hackings getting more and more commonplace each year, we realized that there was a clear and desperate need for the Fortigis around the world. We could no longer stand by in good conscious while millions of people around the world continued to be at risk to attacks. So we jumped into action to provide the same level of security we’ve been involved with for years to everyday people.Join our campaign and help us stop online attacks once and for all.Your contribution will help us ensure that your connected home will be protected by the best security service in the world.  With your help, we will finish our development, expand the power of our cloud and perfect our production processes. The Fortigis team is a band of serial entrepreneurs, hackers, and executives with over 60 years of experience. We’ve founded or co-founded technology companies in the areas of cybersecurity, robotics, IoT, and telecoms. This blend of skills ensures that we are prepared to be successful in both the technology and business sides.Our team has already sold a successful cybersecurity startup focusing on threat intelligence and behavioral analytics. Most of the team has also participated in TechStars, MassChallenge, and other reputable accelerators.But most importantly, we are everyday people that use the internet. Our driving passion is to provide you with the same online protection as we would our own family and loved ones. Our team is well equipped to deliver products we are proud of on time. We have both the technical expertise and the previous business experience required in order to execute the Fortigis project.With that said, there are several things that we need to overcome in order to succeed:
Coordinating with manufacturers to evolve Fortigis from prototype to end product may be challenging.  We have prepared for this by speaking with the manufacturing companies ahead of time in order to get a clear idea of what the process will be like. In this way, most potential issues have already been assessed. Building computer hardware comes with its own inherent risks but given the experience and professionalism of our suppliers, we trust that there will be marginal unforeseen issues. 
We need to optimize the applied software and apps. Our beta products are already equipped for that task, but over the next few months, we will have to improve the software in order to scale and support thousands of homes and connected devices. This is certainly a challenge, but one that we have had a collective hands-on experience to overcome. 

How does the Fortigis protect users?Fortigis is a cloud-enabled, privacy & security wireless, VPN router that checks, controls and manages who connects to a user’s Wi-Fi network. In short, it works with your router to protect all your connected devices.Can something like a smart refrigerator or a smart teddy bear really be used to hack?Yes and it’s not difficult! An 11-year-old in Austin, Texas used his teddy bear to hack into Bluetooth devices to manipulate a robotic teddy bear at a cybersecurity conference in the Netherlands.What could happen if I don’t protect my data and devices?
Your privacy being violatedIP Cameras, smart TVs, voice assistants and other smart devices can lead to you being tracked, and having your personal and sensitive information held for blackmail

Your Identity in someone else’s handsLaptops, desktops or storage devices can be hacked. Shopping from the privacy of your own home isn’t private if you aren’t protected.

Your home unlocked without permissionSmart locks or doors hacked to open at the touch of a button

Your family’s safety is in jeopardySmart devices in your kitchen, heater, AC, CO monitoring can be hacked and turned off when you need it the most to survive.  Medical devices (e.g. insulin pumps) get hacked and your life is at the mercy of the adversaries!

</div></div>","About Las-Bot
We have created a reliable compact laser engraver that is really simple to use. Now engraving your photo on plywood is as easy as printing it on paper. Moreover, you could engrave on other materials: plastic, leather, rubber, paper and even glass. 
And here it is, take a closer look:

Our designers have taken care of the Las-Bot forms and it can perfectly fit into the interior of your house, studio, garage, workshop or any other place where You would like to use it.


Cute own style wallet, personalized cup, beautiful painting for the wall, homemade shadow play, funny breakfast for family or special board game for kids - these are just a few samples how You could improve things around or simply express Your love to family and friends.

Mini-guide
Las-Bot was specially designed for a simple use and after 2-3 times it would not take more than 5 minutes to prepare image for engraving.

General steps are:
1. Take a photo or download/purchase and image You would like to engrave. 
NOTE: Higher resolution of original image would lead to higher quality of engraving. 
2. Convert Your image into a G-code using our software. Some additional filters could be used before converting to stylize image.
NOTE: Software for Windows is available. Software for macOS, IOS and Android is under construction.
NOTE: You could use third-party software and open source software, as Inkscape, to create G-code. Las-Bot would still work with it.
3. Send ready code to the Las-Bot via USB cable, Bluetooth or SD card. 
4. Drink a cup of coffee while Las-Bot is working on Your image engraving.
Programs, Instructions, FAQ, Tips and Tricks would be available on our website for read and download after fund-raising campaign will finish. We hope You would ask many questions during campaign so that we could make information even more useful.

<p>WORLD LIGHT is a 2 in 1 decorative ambiance lighting for your space. During the day, it gives the visual impression of a detailed 3D World Map. Come nightfall, the lamp comes to life, illuminating a fabulous view of Earth at Night. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Inspired by NASA Earth Observatory</strong></h3>
<p>Back in 2019, we created the NITELANDING Lamp out of the special connection we had with the view from the airplane window seat at 30,000ft.  Each time when we think about it, it brings a smile to our faces. </p>
<p>Then when we looked at the sky above and wondered what is it out there in the vastness of space &amp; how will the world look like from there? So out of curiosity, we browse through the available media on space exploration. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630346602/tdyi9e9batqkzughflhi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> The more we see Earth's images from NASA satellite &amp; observatory, we felt as though we walked into the most magnificent art gallery. We then came to our realization that we're one of this little gleam of light that this astronaut saw up there. The beautiful collective lights showed human settlements like the saying ""where there is light, there is life"".</p>

WORLD LIGHT is a 2 in 1 decorative ambiance lighting for your space. During the day, it gives the visual impression of a detailed 3D World Map. Come nightfall, the lamp comes to life, illuminating a fabulous view of Earth at Night. 

Inspired by NASA Earth Observatory
Back in 2019, we created the NITELANDING Lamp out of the special connection we had with the view from the airplane window seat at 30,000ft.  Each time when we think about it, it brings a smile to our faces. 
Then when we looked at the sky above and wondered what is it out there in the vastness of space & how will the world look like from there? So out of curiosity, we browse through the available media on space exploration. 

 The more we see Earth's images from NASA satellite & observatory, we felt as though we walked into the most magnificent art gallery. We then came to our realization that we're one of this little gleam of light that this astronaut saw up there. The beautiful collective lights showed human settlements like the saying ""where there is light, there is life"".

We created the 'WORLD LIGHT' through the eyes of the astronaut viewing Earth at night. We want you to have that same fascination as we have.  WORLD LIGHT by Night

</h1> <p>Hi, my husband and I are cat crazy and between us our families have owned over 25 cats! Although we love our little fur balls, we hate cleaning their litter.

<p>After the smell, dirty litter falling around and back into the clean tray are at the top of everyone's hate list. Stepping in scattered litter bare foot goes beyond annoying into the realm of dangerous, especially for children and pregnant mothers. <br/></p>
<p>We spent years researching the market, but could not find a simple solution for this common frustration. So we decided to create our own solution!

<h2>The Simplest Answer is the Best<br/>
</h2>
<p>After several scoop prototypes, we realized the solution was simple. Turn the scoop design upside down! By placing the grill on the roof, it creates a containment in the base of the scoop to prevent wet, fragile clumps falling back in and around the clean litter (cats hate this). In addition, the rounded grill system allows a smooth and controlled sift as you twist (rotate).<br/></p>
<p>No more litter spillage, brilliant! <br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<h2>
<b>We're under patent pending</b><br/>
</h2>
<p>We underwent many iterations to perfect the grill design and its overall shape to maximize the scoop's effectiveness. For example, the grill has two widths so as you twist the scoop it can sift according to your own litter type with greater control. <br/></p>
<p>We then created 3D printed prototypes and invited several cat lovers around the world to beta test the scoop. Once we were all confident our scoop design was perfected, we submitted it for a patent.<br/></p>

<h2>'It's a revolution' (literally!) </h2>
<p>Twist &amp; Sift is a completely unique design. It's a 
revolution, literally, because you 'revolve' or twist the scoop to sift 
the litter. This simple rotation allows you to shovel, rotate and sift out the clean litter, while containing the dirty litter safely in the base of the scoop.<br/></p>
<p>As you may know, cats have extremely sensitive smell so maintaining a clean litter 
tray helps prevent kitties looking for other places to go around your 
house. <br/></p>

<blockquote><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I have enjoyed camping my whole life. There were many canoe and camping trips with my friends every summer and we always had a tarp to setup. Setting it up and managing it was always a pain.</span></blockquote>
<p>I've watched so many people try many different techniques to get a tarp positioned just right over their campsite before they could enjoy their trip. Some brought ladders and milk crates, others moved picnic tables, and some even had their younger brother stand on their shoulders. I've watched people hurt themselves trying to get the tarp up high enough, and I've witnessed epic arguments between couples trying to communicate across the campsite, in the rain. Often, those people were sour for hours all because of the pain in setting up a tarp.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I had a conversation with a friend of mine that I became inspired and realized there had to be a better way.  I didn’t want a solution that meant damaging the trees, or leaving litter in the campsite.  It had to have zero impact on the campsite and a maximum of efficiency and function.  </p>
<p>The idea for the Kurl was born.</p>
<p>The system was designed to connect to a tree and to secure ropes while making it simple to readjust the tarp height without all the complicated rigging.</p>
<p>I graduated in 2001 from the University of Calgary with a Masters in Environmental Design (Industrial Design). My thesis was the re-design of a neo-natal transport incubator with attention to the user interface. I have designed components for air craft and I specialize in creating ergonomic functionality, this product will do the job it was intended for and is as easy to use as advertised.</p>
<p>My designs have always payed significant attention to human factors and ergonomics.  So it was natural for me to bring these skills into the world of camping.  We went through many iterations to get to the solution seen here.  At last, tarp set-up is a stress-free, fast endeavor, even on the rainiest of days!</p>

And just in case if they are lost or find themselves wandering in unknown neighbhourhood, the Intellicane safety system tells them their current position and even helps them to contact family or a designated friend. One of the most compelling features among the others is the object detection.When we ourselves have trouble finding house keys or wallet , it’d be even more challenging for the visually challenged. Using the phone app which collaberates TAG and bluetooth technologies together, it helps lead them to the object through acoustic signals  and thus helps them find the object they are looking for.These features among the others help the visually challenged overcome their limitation with sensible, practical solutions which are embodied into this Virtual guide called the IntelliCaneIntellicane - A Virtual GuideFeatures : How is your contribution going to be spent?

Our goal is to design & produce a tool for hardware pentesting  :


Internet Of Things 
Industrial devices
Scada systems 
Basic electronic products of everyday life

HardSploit is a Metasploit like tool but for Hardware Hacking.

HardSploit Project is lead by our Company (Opale Security) and its internal teams : 


Yann ALLAIN (former CSO of an International Company, CEO of Opale Security, Electronic Engineer, Senior Pentester, BlackHat Speaker & Trainer)
Julien M. (Electronic Engineer, Hardware & Software Pentester, BlackHat Speaker & Trainer, Electronic Makers)
Gwénolé A. (Software Developper, Open Source Addict, Software Pentester)

How long can we continue to rely on hardware or critical electronic devices without being able to properly assess their security?
The most surprising (disturbing?) fact is  that our industrials and our security experts do not mastered design techniques or audit of hardware systems. There is a gap between the threat and the response capacity of the actors in this field.Therefore the risks of attacks on the processed data increase (personal, supervision process of industrial equipment…).
It is clear that something is needed to help the security community to audit and control embedded systems security.
This is what motivated us to create HardSploit : a complete tool box (Hardware + Software), a Framework which aims to:

Facilitate the audit of electronic systems for  security industry  workers (Consultants, Auditors, Pentesters, Product designers etc.)
Increase the level of security (and trust!) of new communicating products designed by industry

What we want to achieve with the HardSploit Project





HardSploit Framework features



Hardsploit is a tool with software and electronic items. It is a technical and modular plateform (using FPGA) to perform security tests on electronic communications interfaces of embedded devices. It's a Framework.
All-in-one tool for Hardware pentest ! 
Main Functions (HardSploit modules)
The main Hardware security audit functions are




Sniffer, Scanner, Proxy, Interact with electronic bus

Dump memory
...

Hardsploit Modules will let Hardware pentester to intercept, replay and/or and send data via each type of electronic bus used by the Hardware Target. The Level of interaction that pen-testers will have depend on the electronic bus features...
HardSploit 's modules enable you to analyse all sort of electronic bus (serial and parallel type)



JTAG, SPI, I2C's, 
Parallel address & data bus on chip, 
and more others to come in the futur (OneWire, UART, etc...)

Assisted visual wiring function
No more stress with that tremendous part of Hardware pen testing : You will know what need to be connected where !

We integrated into the tool an assisted visual wiring function to help you easier connect all wires to the Hardware target: 

GUI will display the pin organization (Pin OUT) of the targeted chip.
GUI will guide you throughout the wiring process between Hardsploit Connector and the target
GUI will control a set of LED  that will be turn ON and OFF to easy let you find the right Hardsploit Pin Connector to connect to your target



GUI and Software associated
The software part of the project will help conducting an end-to-end security audit. It will be compatible (integrated) with existing tools such as Metasploit. We will offer integration with other API in the future.
Our ambition is to provide a tool equivalent to those of the company Qualys or Nessus(Vulnerability Scanner) or the Metasploit framework but in the domain of embedded / electronic devices.



What is the Current Status of the Project?   



Hardware design is complete 

HardSploit Hardware prototype PCB board is nearly complete (last debugging function in progress)

Firmware (FPGA VHDL module and low level API) is in progress
GUI and Integration in Metasploit Framerwork just begin

More information on http://HardSploit.io to follow all the project steps


But we really need you to 

Be able to create our first volume batch of PCB boards (Volume will reduced the price of the final products)
Be able to buy some (more?) professional assembly equipments dedicated to manufacturing of prototypes, small and medium series. 

To let our team concentrate on this exciting project. The goal is to have a dedicated R&D team for HardSploit.

To create & promote a complete community web site and trainings programs dedicated to Internet of Things Security (a sort of OWASP web site but for security of embedded device)

Why would you be involved?


Participate to a project related to Internet of Things & Security
Your contribution & name will be associated for ever to this project
Have the chance to be able to receive a first Version of HardSploit with its Special PCB board designed only for you !
and more ... see our pleges ;-)




Main difficulties to overcome




Several HardSploit VHDL modules designed for proxying data through electronic buses will be a tricky low level design to achieved


Time & the Security consultant Day to Day business could alter our capacity to progress quickly


But We are optimistic for HardSploit to limit those issues as : 

Julien M. (Electronic engineer in charge of Hardware) doesn't sleep so much ;-)

As I said (I'm a CEO), A day is complete after the 25th hours of works :-p

<p><b>What are
the risks and challenges in making AmbiScreen?</b><br/>Since
January 2014, when we started to bring AmbiScreen to life, we have learned a
lot about the whole manufacturing process. We have visited various events and
conferences worldwide and learned from communication with our potential
customers as well as suppliers. We have few Chinese suppliers and suppliers
from Europe, too. We learned a lot during this
exciting project. But we know „shit can happen“. We have several component suppliers
in factories in China and we want to be correct to you. Y
must know troubles can always happen. If any of our suppliers were delayed, our
whole batch would be delayed, even if other parts would be ready on time. But
what we can say as well is, we are much better in solving problems than we were
2 years ago. The AmbiScreen team is following our internal rules in order to
reduce risks to the minimum.</p>
<p></p>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>Why is there a $35 shipping fee?</b><br/>We developed AmbiScreen as all-in-one device and you’ll find all necessary things in your package. Therefore package is bulky and the fee reflects current costs to reliably ship AmbiScreen to you in most regions around the world.<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>I asked for my Perk to be sent to the wrong address, what should I do?</b><br/>Please contact us at indiegogo (at) ambiscreen.tv</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>When will you ship the AmbiScreen ambient light?</b><br/>We aim to ship the first AmbiScreen pre-orders in March/April 2016<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>I can't get my payment to work in Paypal, what should I do?</b><br/>Email the Indiegogo Customer Happiness Team at <a href=""support@indiegogo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@indiegogo.com</a>. They'll be able to track your transaction and help with any issues<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>I had challenge making a contribution, please help!</b><br/>If you had trouble making a contribution, please check <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526846-Common-Contribution-Errors"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo's common contribution errors</a>.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Want to become a Reseller or purchase in Wholesale quantities?</b><br/>Please e-mail us at hello(at)ambiscreen.tv<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Do I need to configure the device before using?</b><br/>AmbiScreen has predefined number of LEDs on each side of the screen in standard. If you want to change this as well as some other settings, we recommend to setup your wifi (this is done just once and easily by connecting mouse or keyboard via USB to AmbiScreen and setting up credential for your local network). Then you can set all settings via mobile app (such as colors, effects, number of LEDs, adjust the brightness, gamma colors, etc.).<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does AmbiScreen support HDMI 2.0?</b><br/>We are working hard to include HDMI 2.0 support in one of the next generations of AmbiScreen. For now, HDMI 2.0 is not included.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does AmbiScreen support 4K2K?</b><br/>You can use your display with 4K2K and AmbiScreen together -  to do so, connect AmbiScreen to dual-way SCART connector on your display. Direct connection over HDMI in standard version of AmbiScreen supports 1080p. Higher resolution needs more powerful internal parts. As we stated before, geeks can upgrade part as they want. So yes, there is an option to upgrade AmbiScreen to 4K2K version. In future, we plan to include 4K2K support as a standard feature of all AmbiScreen devices.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does AmbiScreen support HDCP?</b><br/>We are using HDMI splitting components with declared HDCP capability from our manufacturers. Currently it supports HDCP 1.3. Later, we are about to support higher versions, too. <span style=""text-decoration: line-through;"">But we are still working on HDCP support for second component in our device and we expect, we will be able to include HDCP in first release.</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What about 3D support?</b><br/>We used some internal parts with 3D support and software part supports 3D, too. But it is important to say that 3D is just experimental feature for geeks and it is disabled by default (for now, we can’t guarantee full 3D support). <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does AmbiScreen support CEC/ARC?</b><br/>We plan to add CEC/ARC capability in one of the next releases. We are working on this feature - it's possible that we solve this soon and final product will have it included. We want to be fair, so we need to say it is 50:50 for now for the first release.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Do you have support for smart bulbs in AmbiScreen?</b><br/>Not yet, but it is on our To-do-list.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>I have a black wall. Will AmbiScreen work with dark walls or any other colo(u)red walls?</b><br/>Yes, colour effects are nice with dark walls, too. But what’s more, you can adjust all RGB levels according to your wall in our mobile app. Please see our video, where we demonstrate the view „WITH and WITHOUT AmbiScreen“ - wall in this video behind the display is painted black.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">What happens if I buy a new TV/display? Can I move it to my new TV?</b><br/>Yes! LEDs are removable (simply unstick) and you can move it to a new TV in the future. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>What kind of LED do you use in AmbiScreen?</b><br/>Currently we have the best results with WS2801 LED chain (these are in standard package). But if you are a geek, you can select another type of LEDs in AmbiScreen settings just right now and use it together with AmbiScreen device.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>I have smaller/larger display. Will it work?</b><br/>Yes, you simply set amount of LEDs on each side of your display and you are done! AmbiScreen is for any screen size. For larger displays order more LEDs from our Perks. If your display is smaller than 50"" turn off unused LEDs via mobile app. So simple.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I connect more leds to AmbiScreen? Let’s say, 100-200 LEDs or more?</b><br/>Yes, you can! Order more extendable LEDs from our Perks and you can connect as many LEDs as you want. We strongly recommend this experimenting for geeks.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<p><b>Do you plan to support other LEDs in AmbiScreen?</b><br/>Yes, in future we plan to support other LEDs than WS2801. You can select other type of LEDs in AmbiScreen settings just right now and use it together with AmbiScreen device.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Will I be able to change type of my LEDs in the future when I buy AmbiScreen now?</b><br/>Yes, you surely will.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>My TV set has USB. Can I connect AmbiScreen directly to it?</b><br/>No, you can use HDMI or analog inputs on AmbiScreen. AmbiScreen contains USB, but it is just for plugging an external HDD, a mouse, a keyboard, a pen drive, or another device to AmbiScreen.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What diagonals is AmbiScreen device for?</b><br/>You can use it with any screen. Every package of AmbiScreen contains LED for effective work on the diagonals up to 50 inches (extremely up to 55 inches - because LED chain is 3,6m long), but you can buy additional LEDs for larger screens (see in Perks). Visual effects depend on several characteristics special for your set-up. One of the main characteristics is the distance between your TV set and the wall. The smaller it is, the worse the light diffuses and the chance to see “black holes” between LED modules is higher, so consistence of a spot is lower. Optimal distance between the wall and display is between 5-12cm (2-5in). </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<b>What is optimal distance from the wall?</b><br/>We recommend 5-12cm (2-5in) distance between the wall and your display for the best experience. We tried up to 20cm (8in), effect was viewable, but we highly recommend 5-12cm (2-5in) distance. The smaller it is, the worse the light diffuses and the chance to see “black holes” between LED modules is higher, so consistence of a spot is lower.<br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>How about displays larger than 50”?</b><br/>The solution is to extend LEDs with an additional LED chain. You can buy additional LEDs for bigger screens (see in Perks). You will obtain additional LEDs with an additional power supply or one more powerful power supply than is packed in standard edition.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does it work with my Raspberry Pi?</b><br/>Can I change Raspberry Pi for more powerful one? Yes, you can. But you will need to rearrange some internal parts.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I change Raspberry Pi for more powerful one?</b><br/>Yes, you can. But you will need to rearrange some internal parts.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does it work with XBMC, OpenELEC, etc?</b><br/>AmbiScreen contains pre-installed OpenELEC media center with Kodi. If you are a geek, you can install any operating system or program your own functionalities.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I upgrade memory with a microSD card?</b><br/>Yes, you can use your own microSD with a higher capacity. AmbiScreen contains a microSD card in package, too.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I update firmware of device when a new version is released?</b><br/>Yes, it requires basic knowledge of computers.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I upgrade hardware by myself?</b><br/>Yes. AmbiScreen is modular device, it means - if you are a geek - you can change any component.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Which input sources are supported?</b><br/>AmbiScreen supports digital and analog inputs - HDMI and RCA video cinch. You can connect video with SCART via RCA, too. Cables, adaptor and connectors are included in package.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Do I need special video converters?</b><br/>No. AmbiScreen has its own HDMI and analog converter and splitter built-in.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does this device require a computer to work?</b><br/>No, you don’t need a computer<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What does ""Future features"" mean?</b><br/>We want to develop these features in the future. These features are currently not available in our device.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Will I need a new AC/DC adapter plug in USA, UK, Australia, Europe, etc.?</b><br/>Don’t worry, it’s already taken into account. We will provide suitable plugs for each country in accordance to a particular delivery state or a backer’s special request.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Where and when can I buy AmbiScreen outside of Indiegogo?</b><br/></p>
<p>Those who didn’t get to participate in our Indiegogo campaign in time can still get all the information and news updates on when and how to get the device from our official project site <a href=""http://www.ambiscreen.tv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ambiscreen.tv</a>.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Internal modules are connected together with standard components. Geeks can change internal modules. Software used in AmbiScreen device is open-source and it is up to you what you install (or simply use pre-installed software).</p>

Turn on your TV and light appears again. Push the button on your wall and light comes to life.AmbiScreen is the most universal open platform for ambient lighting for any display and TV, gaming console, DVD player, set-top box, PC, Mac, PlayStation, Xbox or any other device you have in your home.
   
You can use AmbiScreen with other devices, or even without it, as an autonomous mood light system. AmbiScreen is the first design micro-computer ever with an ambient lighting controller and an integrated media center simple to use for home users, as well as powerful for geeks. You can customize your own AmbiScreen and change its internal parts and build up a new device.At AmbiScreen, we believe it always makes you feel better when using light effects everywhere in the house. So we created AmbiScreen. It is not necessary to have it just behind your TV, you can use it in many scenarios in your bedroom (picture light, bed light), bathroom, living room ... and it works with any device or as a standalone box.AmbiScreen was developed after long years of searching for a suitable device, apt to induce more spectacular light scenes in the household. We were seeking such a device, which would be able to create a lighting atmosphere for chill out; when organizing parties, get the vibrant atmosphere moving; calm the mind down when reading a book or kiss us goodnight on the way to the world of dreams, when falling asleep. Easy to use

set count of your LEDs on each side of your screen. 
AmbiScreen package comes with everything needed to use it out of the box. 52 LEDs 3,6m long are great for every screen size up to 50/55"". Larger display? Simply connect LED extension kit with another 52 LEDs (can be multiplied as many times as you want).



Enjoy lights
Static color.Dynamic colors.
blobs (warm, cold - blue, green, red)
rainbow moods

Have a party? Use a Strobe effect (blue, white, pink) & Snake effectWant more? Develop your own effect and share it with community (for geeks)
What can I set?

speed of LEDs (rate, great to set it up for quick and slow scenes - update frequency of the LEDs)

each R,G,B channel (gamma correction, blacklevel, whitelevel threshold, color saturation gain, color value gain)

count of your LEDs

or even you can install another operating system and use it as your micro-computer with controller for LED lights



Our goal is to become a platform for making agreeable atmosphere and inducing home comfort by means of light elements. A platform exploited by a wide range of users, from home ones to geeks. 
e.g. Would you like to install your own simple web server? Or automatize another function? You can perfectly achieve this with AmbiScreen. The options are amazing, because it uses a reliable micro computer and software package based on Linux, with which you can do whatever you want. 
We had failed to find such a device on the market, so we decided to design it. 




Your eyes need time to adjust to bright and dark scenes. It is called the ""iris"" in your eye which is responsible for this. AmbiScreen helps iris to reduce this time so your eyes and eyes of your children are protected while watching.

RESEARCH RESULTS:""Eyestrain can occur when the eyes are fixed on an object for a long period of time, there is poor lighting,"" explains John Bullough, Ph.D., lighting scientist at the LRC and lead researcher on the television study. ""... Reducing contrasts in perceived brightness between a visual display and its background will result in reduced visual fatigue and eyestrain.""   // www.sciencedaily.com
""...when you watch TV in the dark, then the problem is that that is the only lighting in the home. Your eyes are forced to constantly adjust to different levels of lighting which makes the pupils dilate over and over again. Your eyes use more muscles and fatigue those muscles involved.""   // www.healthguidance.org




























* SCART downsampling usually works just with internal TV tuner (RCA, CVBS), two-way SCART transmits signal from display to AmbiScreen

Ready for large displays
AmbiScreen is for any screen size. Default package comes with LEDs for all screen sizes up to 50""/55"".
Do you have a larger screen? Just add ""LED extension kit"" perk as many times as you need. AmbiScreen is ready for huge displays.  
What if my display is smaller than 50""? That's ok. Turn off unused LEDs via mobile app. So simple.

What are
the risks and challenges in making AmbiScreen?Since
January 2014, when we started to bring AmbiScreen to life, we have learned a
lot about the whole manufacturing process. We have visited various events and
conferences worldwide and learned from communication with our potential
customers as well as suppliers. We have few Chinese suppliers and suppliers
from Europe, too. We learned a lot during this
exciting project. But we know „shit can happen“. We have several component suppliers
in factories in China and we want to be correct to you. Y
must know troubles can always happen. If any of our suppliers were delayed, our
whole batch would be delayed, even if other parts would be ready on time. But
what we can say as well is, we are much better in solving problems than we were
2 years ago. The AmbiScreen team is following our internal rules in order to
reduce risks to the minimum.



Why is there a $35 shipping fee?We developed AmbiScreen as all-in-one device and you’ll find all necessary things in your package. Therefore package is bulky and the fee reflects current costs to reliably ship AmbiScreen to you in most regions around the world.

I asked for my Perk to be sent to the wrong address, what should I do?Please contact us at indiegogo (at) ambiscreen.tv

When will you ship the AmbiScreen ambient light?We aim to ship the first AmbiScreen pre-orders in March/April 2016

I can't get my payment to work in Paypal, what should I do?Email the Indiegogo Customer Happiness Team at support@indiegogo.com. They'll be able to track your transaction and help with any issues

I had challenge making a contribution, please help!If you had trouble making a contribution, please check Indiegogo's common contribution errors.

Want to become a Reseller or purchase in Wholesale quantities?Please e-mail us at hello(at)ambiscreen.tv

Do I need to configure the device before using?AmbiScreen has predefined number of LEDs on each side of the screen in standard. If you want to change this as well as some other settings, we recommend to setup your wifi (this is done just once and easily by connecting mouse or keyboard via USB to AmbiScreen and setting up credential for your local network). Then you can set all settings via mobile app (such as colors, effects, number of LEDs, adjust the brightness, gamma colors, etc.).

Does AmbiScreen support HDMI 2.0?We are working hard to include HDMI 2.0 support in one of the next generations of AmbiScreen. For now, HDMI 2.0 is not included.

Does AmbiScreen support 4K2K?You can use your display with 4K2K and AmbiScreen together -  to do so, connect AmbiScreen to dual-way SCART connector on your display. Direct connection over HDMI in standard version of AmbiScreen supports 1080p. Higher resolution needs more powerful internal parts. As we stated before, geeks can upgrade part as they want. So yes, there is an option to upgrade AmbiScreen to 4K2K version. In future, we plan to include 4K2K support as a standard feature of all AmbiScreen devices.

Does AmbiScreen support HDCP?We are using HDMI splitting components with declared HDCP capability from our manufacturers. Currently it supports HDCP 1.3. Later, we are about to support higher versions, too. But we are still working on HDCP support for second component in our device and we expect, we will be able to include HDCP in first release.

What about 3D support?We used some internal parts with 3D support and software part supports 3D, too. But it is important to say that 3D is just experimental feature for geeks and it is disabled by default (for now, we can’t guarantee full 3D support). 

Does AmbiScreen support CEC/ARC?We plan to add CEC/ARC capability in one of the next releases. We are working on this feature - it's possible that we solve this soon and final product will have it included. We want to be fair, so we need to say it is 50:50 for now for the first release.

Do you have support for smart bulbs in AmbiScreen?Not yet, but it is on our To-do-list.

I have a black wall. Will AmbiScreen work with dark walls or any other colo(u)red walls?Yes, colour effects are nice with dark walls, too. But what’s more, you can adjust all RGB levels according to your wall in our mobile app. Please see our video, where we demonstrate the view „WITH and WITHOUT AmbiScreen“ - wall in this video behind the display is painted black.

What happens if I buy a new TV/display? Can I move it to my new TV?Yes! LEDs are removable (simply unstick) and you can move it to a new TV in the future. 

What kind of LED do you use in AmbiScreen?Currently we have the best results with WS2801 LED chain (these are in standard package). But if you are a geek, you can select another type of LEDs in AmbiScreen settings just right now and use it together with AmbiScreen device.

I have smaller/larger display. Will it work?Yes, you simply set amount of LEDs on each side of your display and you are done! AmbiScreen is for any screen size. For larger displays order more LEDs from our Perks. If your display is smaller than 50"" turn off unused LEDs via mobile app. So simple.

Can I connect more leds to AmbiScreen? Let’s say, 100-200 LEDs or more?Yes, you can! Order more extendable LEDs from our Perks and you can connect as many LEDs as you want. We strongly recommend this experimenting for geeks.


Do you plan to support other LEDs in AmbiScreen?Yes, in future we plan to support other LEDs than WS2801. You can select other type of LEDs in AmbiScreen settings just right now and use it together with AmbiScreen device.

Will I be able to change type of my LEDs in the future when I buy AmbiScreen now?Yes, you surely will.

My TV set has USB. Can I connect AmbiScreen directly to it?No, you can use HDMI or analog inputs on AmbiScreen. AmbiScreen contains USB, but it is just for plugging an external HDD, a mouse, a keyboard, a pen drive, or another device to AmbiScreen.

What diagonals is AmbiScreen device for?You can use it with any screen. Every package of AmbiScreen contains LED for effective work on the diagonals up to 50 inches (extremely up to 55 inches - because LED chain is 3,6m long), but you can buy additional LEDs for larger screens (see in Perks). Visual effects depend on several characteristics special for your set-up. One of the main characteristics is the distance between your TV set and the wall. The smaller it is, the worse the light diffuses and the chance to see “black holes” between LED modules is higher, so consistence of a spot is lower. Optimal distance between the wall and display is between 5-12cm (2-5in). 



What is optimal distance from the wall?We recommend 5-12cm (2-5in) distance between the wall and your display for the best experience. We tried up to 20cm (8in), effect was viewable, but we highly recommend 5-12cm (2-5in) distance. The smaller it is, the worse the light diffuses and the chance to see “black holes” between LED modules is higher, so consistence of a spot is lower.

How about displays larger than 50”?The solution is to extend LEDs with an additional LED chain. You can buy additional LEDs for bigger screens (see in Perks). You will obtain additional LEDs with an additional power supply or one more powerful power supply than is packed in standard edition.

Does it work with my Raspberry Pi?Can I change Raspberry Pi for more powerful one? Yes, you can. But you will need to rearrange some internal parts.

Can I change Raspberry Pi for more powerful one?Yes, you can. But you will need to rearrange some internal parts.

Does it work with XBMC, OpenELEC, etc?AmbiScreen contains pre-installed OpenELEC media center with Kodi. If you are a geek, you can install any operating system or program your own functionalities.

Can I upgrade memory with a microSD card?Yes, you can use your own microSD with a higher capacity. AmbiScreen contains a microSD card in package, too.

Can I update firmware of device when a new version is released?Yes, it requires basic knowledge of computers.

Can I upgrade hardware by myself?Yes. AmbiScreen is modular device, it means - if you are a geek - you can change any component.

Which input sources are supported?AmbiScreen supports digital and analog inputs - HDMI and RCA video cinch. You can connect video with SCART via RCA, too. Cables, adaptor and connectors are included in package.

Do I need special video converters?No. AmbiScreen has its own HDMI and analog converter and splitter built-in.

Does this device require a computer to work?No, you don’t need a computer

What does ""Future features"" mean?We want to develop these features in the future. These features are currently not available in our device.  

Will I need a new AC/DC adapter plug in USA, UK, Australia, Europe, etc.?Don’t worry, it’s already taken into account. We will provide suitable plugs for each country in accordance to a particular delivery state or a backer’s special request.

Where and when can I buy AmbiScreen outside of Indiegogo?
Those who didn’t get to participate in our Indiegogo campaign in time can still get all the information and news updates on when and how to get the device from our official project site www.ambiscreen.tv.

Internal modules are connected together with standard components. Geeks can change internal modules. Software used in AmbiScreen device is open-source and it is up to you what you install (or simply use pre-installed software).",29.0,4,"1 Campaign

<p>We’re fortunate to live in a community where eating healthy is a bit of a ‘thing’. As far as possible we support food producers and suppliers at local farmer’s markets in our area.<br/>We'd love to grow our own crops, but without the luxury of adequate outdoor space, conventional growing methods needed a re-think. This led us to hydroponics! We were surprised to realise that there weren't any affordable, uncomplicated systems on the market - so we decided to design one! During the past ten months, our team of designers brainstormed and tested multiple designs until we developed a system that's affordable, easy to set up, has a small footprint, and is also environmentally friendly. <br/><br/>We are extremely proud to present you with The Blue Grow Garden!</p>

<p>In simple terms, the BlueGrow Garden is a vertical hydroponic plant growing system. Hydroponics is a method of growing various plants in a nutrient-rich water solution, rather than in soil. For the experts out there - our system falls into a sub-category of hydroponics called Nutrient Film Technique (NFT). The main advantage of the NFT system over other forms of hydroponics is that the plant roots are exposed to adequate supplies of water, oxygen, and nutrients.</p>
<p>The BlueGrow Garden is water-wise, energy efficient and has a small surface area. This means that the system is perfectly suited to a variety of environments and can be placed anywhere that gets adequate sun or artificial light.</p>
<p>The impressive part of the BlueGrow Garden (in our opinion, of course!), is the fact that you can assemble it in only nine easy steps in less than ten minutes and with NO tools!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The BlueGrow Garden takes less than ten minutes to assemble, with no finicky parts or tricky methods. Once assembled, simply place your seedlings into the provided baskets and slot them into any of the spaces along the grow tube. Fill the reservoir with water and selected nutrients - then turn the pump on, and you're growing!</p>
<p>When the pump is switched on (and very importantly, stays on), nutrient-rich water is <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>pumped from the reservoir via the inner tube to the top, and then </span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>cascades back down to the reservoir.</span> The continuous circulation of water ensures that your seedlings have all they need to grow into healthy, vibrant plants.</p>
<p>Considerations for growing hydroponic plants includes natural or artificial light availability, nutrient selection, ambient temperature, humidity, and pH level of the water. Once these factors are controlled, hydroponics provides a less time-consuming and superior growing medium than conventional soil. The turn-around time from seedling to harvest can be as short as 15 days depending on what you grow, and an average growth cycle for a variety of herbs and vegetables is around one month. The BlueGrow Garden is also great for growing flowers!</p>

<p>We've spent a fair amount of blood, sweat and tears during the last ten months developing and testing the BlueGrow Garden. The most expensive part in setting up our business is the cost of the moulds and tooling. As is normally the case, the raw material and components (called a bill-of-materials) we need in the production of the BlueGrow Garden are subject to 'economies-of-scale'. Simply, the larger the quantities we buy, the lower the price.</p>

<p>Liquid soap has become a popular method of cleaning anything from hand washing to the local carwash. Modern society and industry have many functions for liquid soap. In many circumstances, it is the only type of soap that can be utilized and various industries have become dependent on liquid soap and many would not exist without it. In fact, many industries and products are completely centered around liquid soap and would not subsist without it.</p>
<p>One of the industries to come out of the advent of liquid soap is the soap dispenser. Soap dispensers come in a great variety of styles and designs and are very convenient for replacing the usual solid, powder or bar soap. Solid or bar soap is very difficult to store once is has been wet. A tray or other device is necessary to prevent the soap from creating a mess and it’s not very practical for use for any purpose other than bathing. The much-preferred method is the liquid soap dispenser and has now become a favorite for bathing also.</p>
<p>Liquid soap for hand washing and for dish washing has been commonly produced in containers that are intended sit by the sink and will typically have a hand pump or some other type of dispensing device included in the container or bottle. Designed to be readily accessible to the sink the bottle of soap will tend to create rings on the sink edge and the use of a pump will usually result in some soap being spilled and either collect around the bottle or drool down the edge of the sink. Wet hands can trail water up to the soap bottle creating a further unsightly disorder. The closer the soap dispenser can be to the water faucet the use of liquid soap becomes more efficient and convenient for the user.</p>
<p>The Tap Faucet Soap Dispenser is a clever and innovative solution the mess and inconvenience that can be caused by bottles of soap sitting by the sink. The product is designed to screw on to the faucets threaded aerator attachment located usually at the end of the faucet pipe. The threads in the center of the product will accept the threaded end of the faucet pipe and tighten to fit snugly on the faucet. A built-in aerator is located in the water flow center of the Tap Faucet Soap Dispenser and allows the normal flow of water through the aerator.</p>
<p>The product is positioned at an extremely convenient arrangement that is accessible yet out of the way. The soap can be accessed through the button that is positioned at the bottom of the device and the button is the entire bottom section. This arrangement will allow a “press anywhere” action on the bottom section for soap. The soap pump is located within the soap reservoir. A pick-up tube attached to the pump assures that the pump will continue to pick-up soap contained within the reservoir when low quantities are present. The soap reservoir contains a large amount of liquid soap but is still small enough to be out of the way while being accessible. A simple press of the pump button will activate the pump and liquid soap will be expelled out the soap dispensing nozzle located underneath the product. A refill access port is located on the top of the reservoir</p>

No more nasty surprises.</p><p>Cleaning toilets is a <strong>nasty affair</strong> and not a topic you would bring up at a party! <strong>Until now! Welcome, The Smart Toilet ""Brush n Plunger"" Combo called ""Looi"".</strong> Through forward-thinking design we have re-invented the old loo brush into a Combo a Brush Plunger - <strong>A World First!!</strong></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://looicombo.sirv.com/Looi/GIF's/BATHROOM.gif"" src=""""/></p><div>
<p> </p>
<p>It's not only a <strong>nasty affair</strong> to unblock a loo, especially when it's <strong>overflowing</strong>, but it can be <strong>very embarrassing and costly too</strong>. The traditional plunger was designed <strong>almost 200 years ago!</strong> It's only recently that the loo brush changed and it still remains the ugly duck in the closet, not to mention the traditional plunger, no wonder <strong>why it is hidden!!</strong></p>
<h2>Safe Materials</h2>
<p>Apart from the<strong> anti-microbial</strong> technology within the plastics which is <strong>certified to ISO standards,</strong> Looi is made of <strong>FDA and RoHS certified materials</strong>, which means all of its components are  <strong>100% non-toxic, safe, and me-friendly.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597976032/d7sgzlpmt2hnfdhs3wxd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Smart Materials</h2>
<p>The <strong>hydrophobic</strong> performance is created by a <strong>silica nano-technology</strong>, also combined into the plastics, which means <strong>water doesn't stick</strong> to the surface, so almost completely dry straight after use. The materials used are also<strong> UV-Resistant.</strong> Looi adopts a different approach that uses a highly sustainable and efficient silicone <strong>UPX elastomer</strong> material that is both <strong>durable and flexible.</strong> Needless to say, Looi is <strong>Odor Free</strong> and won't smell when you sit on the Throne.</p>
<p>Additionally, the brush head and other soft parts are made of <strong>UPX silicone/rubber </strong>which has a very high <strong>tear strength </strong>with additional properties like <strong>anti-corrosion, UV resistant, water-shedding, and anti-bacterial.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597976230/k3xrbahdbxg8pgajxjps.png"" src=""""/></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>It's unique <strong>durable silicone</strong> designed shape combined with <strong>split vertical multi-blades</strong> and a <strong>hollow bottom</strong> will not only clean your toilet but will clear blockages and probably save you money and embarrassment. The all-new toilet <strong>""Brush n Plunger""</strong> Combo. It's the Next-Gen LooTool, <strong>Snazzy, Smart, and Clean</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://looicombo.sirv.com/Looi/GIF's/Top-View-Handles.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<div>
<h2>Toilet Usage</h2>
<p>According to the World Toilet Organization (WTO), the average person uses a toilet <strong>2,500 times</strong> year, or <strong>six to eight times daily</strong>. Imagine 1 Billion people using the loo twice a day without a plunger handy! Imagine how many embarrasing moments Looi can prevent.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://looicombo.sirv.com/Looi/GIF's/Blocked-toilet-1.gif"" src=""""/></div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Why Looi is Different</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Replaces traditional Brush and Plunger sets, combining them into a 2 in 1 Tool!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Me-friendly - kid safe materials</strong></li>
<li><strong>It's Smart, Clean &amp; Ezy-to-use</strong></li>
<li><strong>Complements any bathroom</strong></li>
<li><strong>Cleans efficiently </strong></li>
<li><strong>Doesn't Clog-up</strong></li>
<li><strong>Is Odor free</strong></li>
<li><strong>Dries quickly</strong></li>
<li><strong>Washable</strong></li>
<li><strong>UV Resistant</strong></li>
<li><strong>Non Fading</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ezy Grip</strong></li>
<li><strong>Saves you embarrassment!!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>​</strong></p>
<p><strong>80% of homes</strong> only have the <strong>traditional toilet brush</strong> in the bathroom which is <strong>useless</strong> if and when the loo (sink, bathtub, or basin) blocks. ​With a Looi, it will <strong>complement</strong> any bathroom <strong>setting</strong> and can be used with confidence because it's Snazzy, Smart and Ez-to-use - a <strong>complete LooTool</strong>, always available when something does go wrong. Actually, it might just save you some embarrassment or a <strong>visit</strong> from the plumber.</p>

<p>Although the project is only at the <strong>concept stage</strong>, many design <strong>simulations tests</strong> have been performed to make sure the product will deliver when manufactured.</p>
<p><strong>Drawings and concept functionality</strong> were reviewed and <strong>verified</strong> by our suppliers and the product is <strong>production-ready</strong>. We still feel a prototype is essential to ensure our color scheme matches perfectly and the last unknown issues are sorted before commiting to full production.</p>

<h2>Ezy Grip Handle</h2>
<p>The handle grip is <strong>ergonomically</strong> and <strong>sturdy</strong> designed and ezy on the hands giving you a perfect <strong>non-slip grip</strong> when used as a brush or plunger.

<h2>Changeable Handle</h2>
<p>The <strong>soft grip</strong> of the handle as well as the cap is made from the same durable materials as the bottom parts. If required a new handle can be <strong>replaced</strong> simply by unscrewing and adding the new one, no rocket science.</p>

<h2>Airflow while Docked</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">While Looi is <strong>docked</strong>, there is ample airflow <strong>through</strong> the holder. The blades are <strong>perforated</strong> to allow air passing through the holder. The blades are <strong>extended</strong> to act as legs and also to allow air to <strong>circulate</strong> through the plunger. The holder has <strong>elongated vents</strong> to allow plenty airflow. The water residue that might collect during use, will soon <strong>evaporate</strong> in the holder because of free <strong>circular airflow</strong>. Cleaning the holder is easy.</span></p>

No more nasty surprises.Cleaning toilets is a nasty affair and not a topic you would bring up at a party! Until now! Welcome, The Smart Toilet ""Brush n Plunger"" Combo called ""Looi"". Through forward-thinking design we have re-invented the old loo brush into a Combo a Brush Plunger - A World First!! 
 
It's not only a nasty affair to unblock a loo, especially when it's overflowing, but it can be very embarrassing and costly too. The traditional plunger was designed almost 200 years ago! It's only recently that the loo brush changed and it still remains the ugly duck in the closet, not to mention the traditional plunger, no wonder why it is hidden!!
Safe Materials
Apart from the anti-microbial technology within the plastics which is certified to ISO standards, Looi is made of FDA and RoHS certified materials, which means all of its components are  100% non-toxic, safe, and me-friendly.
 

 
Smart Materials
The hydrophobic performance is created by a silica nano-technology, also combined into the plastics, which means water doesn't stick to the surface, so almost completely dry straight after use. The materials used are also UV-Resistant. Looi adopts a different approach that uses a highly sustainable and efficient silicone UPX elastomer material that is both durable and flexible. Needless to say, Looi is Odor Free and won't smell when you sit on the Throne.
Additionally, the brush head and other soft parts are made of UPX silicone/rubber which has a very high tear strength with additional properties like anti-corrosion, UV resistant, water-shedding, and anti-bacterial.
 

 
It's unique durable silicone designed shape combined with split vertical multi-blades and a hollow bottom will not only clean your toilet but will clear blockages and probably save you money and embarrassment. The all-new toilet ""Brush n Plunger"" Combo. It's the Next-Gen LooTool, Snazzy, Smart, and Clean.
 


Toilet Usage
According to the World Toilet Organization (WTO), the average person uses a toilet 2,500 times year, or six to eight times daily. Imagine 1 Billion people using the loo twice a day without a plunger handy! Imagine how many embarrasing moments Looi can prevent.
 

 
Why Looi is Different

Replaces traditional Brush and Plunger sets, combining them into a 2 in 1 Tool!
Me-friendly - kid safe materials
It's Smart, Clean & Ezy-to-use
Complements any bathroom
Cleans efficiently 
Doesn't Clog-up
Is Odor free
Dries quickly
Washable
UV Resistant
Non Fading
Ezy Grip
Saves you embarrassment!!

​
80% of homes only have the traditional toilet brush in the bathroom which is useless if and when the loo (sink, bathtub, or basin) blocks. ​With a Looi, it will complement any bathroom setting and can be used with confidence because it's Snazzy, Smart and Ez-to-use - a complete LooTool, always available when something does go wrong. Actually, it might just save you some embarrassment or a visit from the plumber.
 



 

 
Although the project is only at the concept stage, many design simulations tests have been performed to make sure the product will deliver when manufactured.
Drawings and concept functionality were reviewed and verified by our suppliers and the product is production-ready. We still feel a prototype is essential to ensure our color scheme matches perfectly and the last unknown issues are sorted before commiting to full production.
 

 
Ezy Grip Handle
The handle grip is ergonomically and sturdy designed and ezy on the hands giving you a perfect non-slip grip when used as a brush or plunger. The top is designed to sit snugly in your palm when used for clearing a blockage. The handle is also changeable if required.
 

 
Changeable Handle
The soft grip of the handle as well as the cap is made from the same durable materials as the bottom parts. If required a new handle can be replaced simply by unscrewing and adding the new one, no rocket science.
 

 
Looi's Makeup Summary
 
The design aimed to create something elegant yet simple which is visible in every bathroom
 


Plunger Brush  - Blades act as Bristles

The blades wipe away grime as opposed to the scratching of current brushes
The blades don't get clogged up and are flexible and will not scratch the surface

The pointy tips of the blades make ""under the rim"" cleaning a breeze
Blades at the bottom are extended to act as legs when docked, allowing airflow to dry Looi, even inside the plunger
The bottom part acts as a plunger and forms part of the brush. The material is flexible to expand when used to unblock the loo. Ezy to use when needed and friendly-me



Handle - Ergonomical Ezy on the hand

The handle is made of the same material used on the head, providing a soft grip 

The ""doorknob"" top is designed for comfort when used as a plunger
Apart from stylish, the handle is designed to sit snuggly in your palm when used for normal cleaning

It screws into an insert and can be replaced, either when the head needs replacement or when damaged



Holder - Stylish yet Simple

The holder is designed around Looi in order to maximize airflow when not in use
It has a rigid stand to prevent tip over
Easy washable 



 

 

 
Roll n Wrist - Brush
Looi follows the toilet contours and with a simple ""Roll n Wrist"" action, it will wipe away any marks. The soft material won't scratch the surface of the loo.
The spiky blades on the brush effortlessly reach the underside of the rim by a simple ""Roll a Wrist"" action. It also rinses clean with a flush so no nasties are left behind on the blades or head.
 

 
Plunger
Regardless of how full the loo is, simply aim at the bottom opening, press down a couple of times, and.... Voilà (Wa-Lah). This anti-germ, multi-purpose design with aligned blades will give you enhanced cleaning and unblocking power. The handle's sturdy design will make using the plunger, unblocking the loo, a breeze!
 
 
 

 
Dynamics
The dock's simple design is elegant yet efficient to allow airflow to naturally dry any water residue after use. Looi is visible from the top and enhances the uniqueness and color of the brush to match the decor. The bottom of the blades acts as ""legs"" which allows ample airflow while docked.
 

 
Airflow while Docked
While Looi is docked, there is ample airflow through the holder. The blades are perforated to allow air passing through the holder. The blades are extended to act as legs and also to allow air to circulate through the plunger. The holder has elongated vents to allow plenty airflow. The water residue that might collect during use, will soon evaporate in the holder because of free circular airflow. Cleaning the holder is easy.
 
 
 
Under the Rim
While many current brushes have gadgets & gizmo's attached, they still fall short of cleaning under the rim properly. With Looi, you won't have that problem. The pointy blades are designed to get in under the rim with ease.
 

 

 
Color Range
These are currently the 4 colors we intend to use. Research and Decor Consulting shows that these are the most popular color for modern decor. Its possible to add more if there are a demand.

This lamp can function as the primary light source in your room, further tailoring the experience of dynamic lighting. We combine the following technologies:
Aromatherapy 
Dynamic Lighting
Sound Therapy
Crescent Lamp pairs with a mobile application. Based on the information you enter into the application, a custom schedule is created which combines the three technologies into one comprehensive experience. All of these features combine for an unparalleled sleep experience that you cannot attain from any other sleep aid.Over time, as you get accustomed to your individualized Crescent Lamp, it gets easier to fall asleep and maintain your sleep cycle. As you become used to the lamp, you become conditioned to the various stimuli of the lamp. How does a Crescent Lamp help you fall asleep?The following stimuli will help an individual fall asleep at night:
The scent of lavender to calm you down and increase deep sleep
Warm light tones which promote melatonin growth through removal of blue light tones
Soothing sounds which enables users to enter sleep
When the combination of smell, lighting, and sound is activated 30 minutes before you sleep, you will begin to feel drowsy as you associate these stimuli with sleep. This is key to maintaining a strong sleep cycle.Stay asleep at night.The aromatherapeutic diffuser will release scent either at a default time, or at a variable time to ensure restful sleep throughout the night. Throughout the night, as you get closer to waking up, the scent will change to a revitalizing (lemon) based scent in order to help you wake up. Start your day with Crescent Lamps.As you near you wake up time, the three technologies of your Crescent Lamp will move into a wake up stage, initiating the following:
Blue light to suppress melatonin product and beat morning tiredness 
A customizable, gentle sound such as a Spotify song, classical music, or a standard alarm tone
Revitalizing scents such as mint, eucalyptus and lemon which help you feel refreshed
Perfect for those without stable sleep schedules.Crescent Lamps are optimized for people traveling and cannot maintain a strict sleep schedule while on the go. Due to the sleek and portable design, this lamp can be taken while traveling to maintain your sleep cycle.This makes Crescent Lamps perfect for those who live at home and those constantly on the move. Enabling all types of customization. The Crescent App allows you control over your sleep schedule. By simply entering parameters such as time asleep and time awoken, the Crescent App determines and controls:
Frequency and duration of scent release
Types of scent emitted
Amount of blue light emitted
Intensity of light
Sound, type, and intensity of sound
Humans have relied on the awakening effects of the bright blue sky to prepare us to start our days and the soothingly orange sunsets to induce rest. To prove the effectiveness of our features, we utilize several studies:
The effects of lavender have been tested by a variety of medical establishments, such as the University of Massachusetts Medical School and EBCAM. 
One trial from the Wesleyan University showed that with bursts of lavender, young men and women experienced more deep sleep and woke up with more vigor in the morning. 
Why is Crescent Lamps perfect for your room?In order to create a product which could fit in any setting, we prioritized a minimalist design. This includes a variety of significant features including:
A low profile material so the Crescent Lamp can look good in all settings
A lightweight build and shape lead to easy transportation
Form factor of a lamp to provide functionality in a compact size
All controls are through the Crescent App, allowing for a clean display of the Crescent Lamp
We have many plans for future products and features, but one we would like to talk about is the inclusion of biometric data in the process of a customizable lamp. We hope to connect with devices such as FitBits and phones to monitor:
Heartbeat
Temperature
Sleep duration
Sleep stages
We know that with funding we can implement these features into our product. This will lead to a much more customized sleep experience. Your Crescent Lamp will dynamically change to fit you. With the funding we receive from our backers, we plan to:
Implement biometric data from your phone or wearable technology to further customize your sleep experience
Test and further refine our current prototype
Finalize the design for our final, market-ready product
Reach out to design and manufacturing experts to talk about implementing technology in a market-ready product
Begin tooling for manufacturing

<p>I enjoy the flavor of a green bowl, not the taste of burnt resin.</p>
<p>There is nothing like a tasty green bowl and a nice glass of wine or whisky. The flavor matters and nasty resin or bad chemical cleaners can ruin the flavor. The problem is, all the market leading pipe cleaning solutions could never got my pipe, bong or vape really clean. So, I decided to tick my wife off and start experimenting in our garage with botanicals and natural ingredients to figure out how to remove the resin and enjoy the flavor of the bud.  After a spell, I created an amazing cleaner. I've kept it secret for years, but now I'm releasing it to the public.</p>

<h2><strong>Aero Craft Panels Ltd</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Our Story: Johan, aviation, and the panels</strong></h3>
<p>Aero Craft Panels was founded just under a year ago by Johan Brand, whose creative ideas have grown from a childhood of aviation, a career as a helicopter pilot with the South African Police, and a lifetime of designing in workshops... </p>
<p><i>""I have a great fascination with all things aviation and I love aircraft; I always have and I always will. I love aviation traditions and history.   The stories surrounding great aviators, past and present, form a true inspiration for me.  In addition to this, I have always had a desire to design, create and build.  It is these passions of mine that ultimately led me to creating Aero Craft Panels!"" </i></p>
<p>Johan never suspected that his design for a drinks panel that looked like the side of an aeroplane would end up being so popular.  With just a few Facebook posts to advertise his new product, Johan was already selling more bar cabinets than he could easily keep up with.  Such a clear demand for the <strong>Drinks Panel - Mark ll </strong> as well as for the wall art panels (panels that do not open) has been an incredible and welcome surprise.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556217661/uboiy0zxdnc9cobm0l6w.jpg"" src=""""/><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Products:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Aero Craft Drinks Panel - Mark II </strong></h3>
<p>Our exclusive <strong>Drinks Panel - Mark II </strong>is by far our most popular panel model. Measuring 112cm x 75cm,  it is functional and beautiful. When closed, the panel sits attached to a wall.  Then, with a simple turn of the key, it opens smoothly using gas struts to reveal a one-of-a-kind and ready to enjoy drinks cabinet. All that remains to be done is to dim the LED back lights, pour the drinks…. Bottoms Up!</p>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555151685/vlllm1gmmqmvllklyfep.jpg"" src=""""/></p></div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>Wall Art Panels</strong></h3>
<div>Our unique <strong>Wall Art Panels</strong> are striking pieces of aviation art.  They can be ordered in various background finishes and with a choice of national roundel, insignia designs and/or identification numbers. Two sizes are available: small measures 57cm x 40cm and large measures 112cm x 75cm.  LED back lighting is optional.</div>

<div> </div>
<h3><strong>Workshop and Detail</strong></h3>
<div>In our small Pennine workshop, we design and craft these beautiful, bespoke aluminium panels to perfectly represent an aircraft fuselage section.  They are built using the actual aircraft building techniques and methods of 75 years ago, right down to the  aircraft rivets used during assembly.   We put an extremely high emphasis on quality and attention to detail.  Johan puts a great deal of thought and passion into the mechanics and design of our panels to make sure they are both functional for today's world  but also historically authentic.</div>

<h3>
<strong>Why do we need your help?</strong> </h3>
<p>We are completely inspired by how pleased each of our customers is with their panel.  However, our increasing popularity means we have to build the company in order to keep up with demand and to bring our unique products to as many aviation enthusiasts as possible!  We want to continue to uphold our standard of workmanship and quality while expanding our business, so we are asking for your help!</p>
<p>The proceeds of this campaign will be used to fund:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556386070/x3n2pawyaob0qjnh50fr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Premises:  Our first step will be to find and relocate to a bigger workshop, as each panel is still crafted in Johan's tiny, one room cottage workshop. Johan often comments that, <i>""It is so small in there, I need to step outside to change my mind."" </i> Part of this relocation will also be hiring an apprentice, expanding our small but growing team. </li>
<li>Exhibitions:  Attend a selection of UK air shows and aviation exhibitions, raising our profile and bringing Aero Craft Panels to more and more people!</li>
<li>New tools:  Johan is still using his old faithful corded hand drill bought back in the 90's, so he is most definitely in need of an upgrade!  As demand grows, so does the need and use of our tools. These new tools and larger space, will also enable efficient development of new, exclusive products.</li>

Our Story: Johan, aviation, and the panels
Aero Craft Panels was founded just under a year ago by Johan Brand, whose creative ideas have grown from a childhood of aviation, a career as a helicopter pilot with the South African Police, and a lifetime of designing in workshops... 
""I have a great fascination with all things aviation and I love aircraft; I always have and I always will. I love aviation traditions and history.   The stories surrounding great aviators, past and present, form a true inspiration for me.  In addition to this, I have always had a desire to design, create and build.  It is these passions of mine that ultimately led me to creating Aero Craft Panels!"" 
Johan never suspected that his design for a drinks panel that looked like the side of an aeroplane would end up being so popular.  With just a few Facebook posts to advertise his new product, Johan was already selling more bar cabinets than he could easily keep up with.  Such a clear demand for the Drinks Panel - Mark ll  as well as for the wall art panels (panels that do not open) has been an incredible and welcome surprise.
 
The Products:
Aero Craft Drinks Panel - Mark II 
Our exclusive Drinks Panel - Mark II is by far our most popular panel model. Measuring 112cm x 75cm,  it is functional and beautiful. When closed, the panel sits attached to a wall.  Then, with a simple turn of the key, it opens smoothly using gas struts to reveal a one-of-a-kind and ready to enjoy drinks cabinet. All that remains to be done is to dim the LED back lights, pour the drinks…. Bottoms Up!

 
Wall Art Panels
Our unique Wall Art Panels are striking pieces of aviation art.  They can be ordered in various background finishes and with a choice of national roundel, insignia designs and/or identification numbers. Two sizes are available: small measures 57cm x 40cm and large measures 112cm x 75cm.  LED back lighting is optional.
 

 
Workshop and Detail
In our small Pennine workshop, we design and craft these beautiful, bespoke aluminium panels to perfectly represent an aircraft fuselage section.  They are built using the actual aircraft building techniques and methods of 75 years ago, right down to the  aircraft rivets used during assembly.   We put an extremely high emphasis on quality and attention to detail.  Johan puts a great deal of thought and passion into the mechanics and design of our panels to make sure they are both functional for today's world  but also historically authentic.

 

 

Why do we need your help? 
We are completely inspired by how pleased each of our customers is with their panel.  However, our increasing popularity means we have to build the company in order to keep up with demand and to bring our unique products to as many aviation enthusiasts as possible!  We want to continue to uphold our standard of workmanship and quality while expanding our business, so we are asking for your help!
The proceeds of this campaign will be used to fund:

Premises:  Our first step will be to find and relocate to a bigger workshop, as each panel is still crafted in Johan's tiny, one room cottage workshop. Johan often comments that, ""It is so small in there, I need to step outside to change my mind.""  Part of this relocation will also be hiring an apprentice, expanding our small but growing team. 
Exhibitions:  Attend a selection of UK air shows and aviation exhibitions, raising our profile and bringing Aero Craft Panels to more and more people!
New tools:  Johan is still using his old faithful corded hand drill bought back in the 90's, so he is most definitely in need of an upgrade!  As demand grows, so does the need and use of our tools. These new tools and larger space, will also enable efficient development of new, exclusive products.
Website update: Our website is in desperate need of an update.

 

£10,000  Re-location to larger workshop premises from our current one room workshop.

£4,000  Exhibition space at a number of major UK airshows and one American airshow.

£2500  Upgrade of tooling and equipment for existing and exciting new product development.

£2000 Website upgrade and customisation.

<p>The Baby Boomer generation is one of the largest groups of population and they are turning 65 every eleven-seconds.  The Baby Boomer generation has redefined every thing about American life — the way schools were designed, the way our homes are designed, the structure of the work week and the nature of work itself, the role of fitness in our daily lives and they are going to redefine what it means to age and grow older.  They will not be satisfied with unattractive, function only products.  They have had the largest influence on consumer driven decisions and are often the first adopters of new ideas and technologies.  We are able to keep people living at home whether they are aging or experiencing a disability, and this group of people does not want their home to look or feel like a hospital.  The need for well designed daily living aids that can blend into their surroundings and provide the assistance and safety for those that need them.

<p>We have self funded the first three years of Millea Living. During that time, we have created our brand and marketing strategy, designed the entire Judith Collection which includes a bench, a wall-mounted bench, a cart, a bed stability rail, toilet stability bars and grab bars.  We have prototyped and produced the Judith Bench which is available to the public now.<strong> </strong> With this funding, we are planing to <strong>prototype and manufacture the first run of the Judith Cart</strong>. </p>
<p>We have found that educating the public about the need for better designed assistive products is highly important. There are very few companies focusing on this growing need.  Most people are unaware of the safety and independence issues that many people face. The funding will also be used to take advantage of opportunities to speak, write and educate people on the challenges and opportunities about design for all ages and abilities.</p>

The Judith Cart is designed to provide a work surface at a bed or chair, but it can also double as a bar serving cart!  A storage area under the table surface can be used to store computers, books, newspapers or other items.  Choose your caddie insert to hold remotes, medications and other items you need close at hand. You can even choose our ice bucket insert! 

 



Portable: The lightweight and durable design allows for easy transport throughout the home.

Adjustable Height: The Judith Cart can be adjusted for perfect positioning alongside any bed height. 

Customizable: Interchangeable storage inserts accommodate a variety of needs. Choose an ice bucket, locking top enclosure, or open insert.  

Powered Up: Equipped with standard 120V plug-ins, just plug it in, and The Judith Cart is powered to keep your blender or laptop going strong. Use the Power Port to recharge wireless chargers and power up anything with a USB port.

Multipurpose: The beauty of all Millea Living furnishings is their . . . well . . . beauty!  The Judith Cart can also function as a bar cart, work station or side table anywhere in your home.

Sustainable and Durable: We strive to use recycled materials that also can be easily recycled, as well as long-lasting materials and components.

Easy to Clean: Life can be messy! The non-porous surfaces of The Judith Bench allow easy cleanup of splashes and spills, and the removable inserts are dishwasher safe.

And you will not forget it.</h2><p>Based on research conducted by Avast, 83% of Americans use weak passwords, and 10% use very weak ones like ""qwerty"", ""123456"" or ""iloveyou"" because it is easy to keep them in mind if they are simple. We in our team have the same problem. If you have a strong enough password it is difficult to keep it in mind and if you have a simple one it is totally unsafe. Does this sound familiar to you?</p><p> </p><h2>However, we found a solution</h2><p>This card can keep a lot of passwords. You can easily reconstruct your password from it. There are no ways to hack the card, you don't need electricity, WiFi, or cellular because Mnemocard does not need all of that, it's just a piece of plastic, after all, beautifully designed, and with unique characters on it though.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611343757/blalgjvbq2vbaj9fqacp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>How to use mnemocard:</h2><p>1.

Set your own symbol (digit(s), word(s), character(s)) to ""Joker"". Keep it in mind and use it among other symbols of your password.</p><p>4. Don't draw, scratch, or somehow mark a pattern on your mnemocard.</p><p>5. To retrieve your password take your mnemocard and read symbols following your pattern.</p><p><strong>And one more thing - you don't really need to hide your mnemocard.

And you will not forget it.Based on research conducted by Avast, 83% of Americans use weak passwords, and 10% use very weak ones like ""qwerty"", ""123456"" or ""iloveyou"" because it is easy to keep them in mind if they are simple. We in our team have the same problem. If you have a strong enough password it is difficult to keep it in mind and if you have a simple one it is totally unsafe. Does this sound familiar to you? However, we found a solutionThis card can keep a lot of passwords. You can easily reconstruct your password from it. There are no ways to hack the card, you don't need electricity, WiFi, or cellular because Mnemocard does not need all of that, it's just a piece of plastic, after all, beautifully designed, and with unique characters on it though. How to use mnemocard:1. Create a memorable pattern. Try to use symbols from both tables.2. Make the length of your password to at least 8 symbols.3. Set your own symbol (digit(s), word(s), character(s)) to ""Joker"". Keep it in mind and use it among other symbols of your password.4. Don't draw, scratch, or somehow mark a pattern on your mnemocard.5. To retrieve your password take your mnemocard and read symbols following your pattern.And one more thing - you don't really need to hide your mnemocard. Only you know your pattern and thus the password behind it.And also: In case you lose your mnemocard, remember, there are two of them, and they are identical. Example: How to use mnemocard for different websites.  Our features:1. Three levels of protection: unique symbols at each card, two separate tables, ""Joker"" symbol for additional security.2. Limitless amount of passwords.3. Tables have colorish and geometry mnemomarks for easy pattern creation and navigation.4. Each mnemocard has a unique set of symbols.5. You don't really need to hide your mnemocard.6. It is the size of a credit card. You can keep it in your wallet.7.  You don't need Wi-Fi and electricity. Mnemocard is working withoutall of it :)Type of cards:There are two types of cards available. The first one is a regular mnemocard. It consists of two tables for 2D patterns (40 symbols), and a limitless amount of passwords. Another one is mnemocard+. It consists of four tables on two levels. You can create 3D patterns (80 symbols) and an even more limitless amount of passwords. What is in the ""box""1. Each user will get a unique stylish mnemocard for everyday usage.2. Plus another copy of your unique stylish mnemocard.3. Detailed user manual.4. Special sticker for your laptop.5. And all stuff is placed in the special opaque secure envelope.   What after crowdfunding:First of all, we would like to reduce the price of mnemocards and make them even more affordable. If we can raise a certain amount of funds, we can afford to produce them in bulk and reduce the cost of materials and manufacturing.In the future, we also want to use other more environment-friendly materials for the mnemocards like metal, wood, paper, and carbon.

</div>
<div><b>Noise &amp; Light</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Greatly reduces noise originating from outside the bedroom and home.</li>
<li>Greatly reduces the noise of your partner's snoring so that you can get a consistent high quality sleep.</li>
<li>No need for blackout blinds as you will be able to sleep in total darkness while your room is lit by bright sunlight.</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Transformability</b></div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Harmony offers 5 different and effective positions, each one addressing and providing a solution for a different bed partner issue.</li>
<li>Harmony allows you and your bed partner to sleep together in the same traditional open bed but when the need arises, Harmony can quickly and easily transform to a different position that suits your current situation.</li>
<li>Serenity transforms from the traditional open bed to a covered position to block out disruptive noise and light originating from outside the bedroom or home. </li>
</ul>
<div>
<b>Health and Relationship</b> </div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Enjoy consistent and uninterrupted sleep...every night.</li>
<li>Greatly reduce the chance of waking up due to your partner, others in the house or noise originating from outside your home.</li>
<li>Waking up well rested greatly optimizes your mood, energy level and productivity for the day ahead.</li>
<li>A well-rested couple, without suffering from each other's sleep issues, is a happy couple!</li>
<li>Sanctuary can be optionally tilt-enabled. This reduces puffy eyes and puffy face when waking up in the morning. The entire mattress can be tilted so that you do not suffer gradual neck or back pains.</li>
<li>Sanctuary's optional sunlight lamp can be programmed to gradually brighten to coincide with your wake-up time. Why set an abrupt and piercing alarm or radio station when you can wake up slowly and naturally with the sun...which is proven to be healthier and more rejuvenating.</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Comfort</b></div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Harmony's patent-pending design means no more compromising on the room temperature at night...Sanctuary's internal climate control allows you and your partner to set different temperatures (in the Total Privacy Position)</li>
<li>Each partner can sleep on a different mattress style and firmness!<span style=""background-color: initial;""> You can sleep on a softer mattress while your partner sleeps on a harder mattress.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Intimacy</b></div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Harmony's Tatami position offers a uniquely relaxing and intimate environment with optional Wallboards, mood lighting and recessed speakers. Take a mental break during the day or at night and enjoy the relaxation and environment the Tatami Position provides.</li>
<li>Lay with your partner under a combined, large enclosure surrounded by a beautiful landscape while you listen to your favorite music under soft, slowly changing mood lights. For intimate times...make it Tatami time.</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Savings/Environmental</b></div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Save up to 20% on your energy bill! Sanctuary's optional internal climate control heats or cools JUST you and/or your partner's individual sleeping space(s).</li>
<li>Why heat or cool your entire home at night when you can just heat or cool your own individual sleeping space for substantially less......Sanctuary actually pays for itself over time!</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Security</b></div>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Sanctuary provides earthquake protection! It is built strong and can withstand falling debris in the event of an earthquake!</li>
<li>Sanctuary is optionally locking-enabled (from the inside). You will have piece of mind knowing that you can be sleeping in a secure and protected environment at any time.</li>

</div><div>
<div>No one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one that is the World's 1st anything. We have worked diligently to prepare this product for Indiegogo, manufacturing and fulfillment, but there are inherent risks you should consider:<br/>
</div>
<div>
<i>Product Adjustments:</i> As Sanctuary gets ready for production, there will likely be some adjustments to improve the final product and ultimately benefit you, the consumer! Therefore, the actual product delivered may not be exactly as shown or described. Remember, you are contributing to a work-in-progress.<br/>
</div>
<div>
<i>Estimated Shipping Time:</i> A product like Sanctuary requires sourcing various components from a variety of manufacturers. Therefore, if one manufacturer is late on shipping materials/components, it could delay the shipping process. HOWEVER, as a precaution, we will endeavor to have backup suppliers so as to minimize the risk of late shipment.</div>

</div></div>","You supply your mattress, we'll provide Sanctuary!One of the things that we all do, every day, is sleep.



Yet, for
many reasons, we do not get the restful and fulfilling sleep that we need;
The cost to us personally and as a society is high; from medical ailments to poor performance at
work.
Further, approximately
10.2 million couples sleep apart, in separate beds or separate rooms.
Some people even buy expensive mattresses, only to end up sleeping on the couch. 
Why is that?

Perhaps it's
not the mattress but the sleep environment that makes the difference.

_____________________________________________________________________________


Hi, my name is David. I am the founder and CEO of Foundation Planning Corp. My partners and I have been working a long time on this project. Milestones that we have accomplished include: design, engineering, construction of a working prototype, patent applications and the securement of a manufacturing facility.
I want everyone to join the revolution and help change bed design forever!_____________________________________________________________________________


What is Sanctuary?
We created a revolutionary* bed that when needed or desired, can easily transform from a standard open, exposed mattress to a covered mattress.In the Standard position, the cover stores under the bed and can be rotated over the bed at any time to form a covered position.


Serenity and
Harmony both accomplish this but Harmony goes one step further as the beds can
separate to form more positions (Reading, Privacy & Total Privacy) or join
to form one covered position (Tatami).
Sanctuary - it's time to ensconce yourself in a unique, relaxing and sleep-inducing environment.
* Patent Pending; U.S., Canada & International PCT (has been approved).



Harmony offers the flexibility of sleeping with your partner in the same standard open bed while being able to, at any time, transform to any of 5 unique positions, each providing a solution to a problem.





Standard Position - Sleep with your partner in the same Standard open bed....





        Reading Position - Read late into the night while your partner drifts to sleep               undisturbed.... 


3.


        Privacy Position - Get up in the morning, turn on the lights and get dressed                 without disturbing your partner!


4.        Total Privacy Position - Enjoy peaceful sleep, no matter how loud your partner         snores....

5. 


       Tatami Position - For intimate times........make it Tatami time.

       
      (inside Tatami - choose your favorite surrounding) 
Serenity is great for singles and couples (Serenity 60"")!

Why? - The Benefits of Sanctuary

Noise & Light


Greatly reduces noise originating from outside the bedroom and home.
Greatly reduces the noise of your partner's snoring so that you can get a consistent high quality sleep.
No need for blackout blinds as you will be able to sleep in total darkness while your room is lit by bright sunlight.

Transformability



Harmony offers 5 different and effective positions, each one addressing and providing a solution for a different bed partner issue.
Harmony allows you and your bed partner to sleep together in the same traditional open bed but when the need arises, Harmony can quickly and easily transform to a different position that suits your current situation.
Serenity transforms from the traditional open bed to a covered position to block out disruptive noise and light originating from outside the bedroom or home. 


Health and Relationship 



Enjoy consistent and uninterrupted sleep...every night.
Greatly reduce the chance of waking up due to your partner, others in the house or noise originating from outside your home.
Waking up well rested greatly optimizes your mood, energy level and productivity for the day ahead.
A well-rested couple, without suffering from each other's sleep issues, is a happy couple!
Sanctuary can be optionally tilt-enabled. This reduces puffy eyes and puffy face when waking up in the morning. The entire mattress can be tilted so that you do not suffer gradual neck or back pains.
Sanctuary's optional sunlight lamp can be programmed to gradually brighten to coincide with your wake-up time. Why set an abrupt and piercing alarm or radio station when you can wake up slowly and naturally with the sun...which is proven to be healthier and more rejuvenating.

Comfort



Harmony's patent-pending design means no more compromising on the room temperature at night...Sanctuary's internal climate control allows you and your partner to set different temperatures (in the Total Privacy Position)
Each partner can sleep on a different mattress style and firmness! You can sleep on a softer mattress while your partner sleeps on a harder mattress.


Intimacy



Harmony's Tatami position offers a uniquely relaxing and intimate environment with optional Wallboards, mood lighting and recessed speakers. Take a mental break during the day or at night and enjoy the relaxation and environment the Tatami Position provides.
Lay with your partner under a combined, large enclosure surrounded by a beautiful landscape while you listen to your favorite music under soft, slowly changing mood lights. For intimate times...make it Tatami time.

Savings/Environmental



Save up to 20% on your energy bill! Sanctuary's optional internal climate control heats or cools JUST you and/or your partner's individual sleeping space(s).
Why heat or cool your entire home at night when you can just heat or cool your own individual sleeping space for substantially less......Sanctuary actually pays for itself over time!

Security



Sanctuary provides earthquake protection! It is built strong and can withstand falling debris in the event of an earthquake!
Sanctuary is optionally locking-enabled (from the inside). You will have piece of mind knowing that you can be sleeping in a secure and protected environment at any time.

Risks & Challenges

No one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one that is the World's 1st anything. We have worked diligently to prepare this product for Indiegogo, manufacturing and fulfillment, but there are inherent risks you should consider:


Product Adjustments: As Sanctuary gets ready for production, there will likely be some adjustments to improve the final product and ultimately benefit you, the consumer! Therefore, the actual product delivered may not be exactly as shown or described. Remember, you are contributing to a work-in-progress.


Estimated Shipping Time: A product like Sanctuary requires sourcing various components from a variety of manufacturers. Therefore, if one manufacturer is late on shipping materials/components, it could delay the shipping process. HOWEVER, as a precaution, we will endeavor to have backup suppliers so as to minimize the risk of late shipment.

<p>To celebrate 110 years of the famous Titanic, we would want to hand-build 110 units of this historic lifeboat model. They will be available in 2021 or could be earlier depending on your funding.</p>
<p>The RMS Titanic’s lifeboat model will surely bring back the memory of the most tragic sea disasters in modern history. Lifeboat 7 was a wooden starboard lifeboat and the first one to be lowered from the sinking Titanic. Although there was a capacity of 65 people, it left with only 28 people on board, thus with 37 empty seats. The reason why was that many women and children were reluctant to enter a small wooden lifeboat and preferred to stay on the massive ’unsinkable’, but sinking, Titanic.<br/><br/>Our model is beautifully hand built from scratch using ’plank on frame’ construction method using the highest grade of western red cedar. It features intricate details such as wooden paddles, footings, thwarts, braces, ropes, flotation devices, rudder, tiller, lifelines, and much more. The model comes with a detachable wood stand and high precision laser engraved nameplate of Liverpool with star line flag and SS Titanic name on the model stern and front bow.

The rest of the funds will be used for equipment, materials and tools such as professional paper cutting machines and large format printers. Part of the funds will be dedicated to renting an office space, setting up the production and other legal paperwork. Lastly, the rest is for Indiegogo fees  and financial transaction fees.

All packages will be shipped from Portugal which means that all backers from EU countries won't have any additional costs.We have already shipped some of our products to the USA and Australia with no additional costs for the recipients, but we cannot guarantee this since it doesn't depend on us. Each country has their own import duty and tax rules, so if you have already ordered something from Europe in the past, this will be similar experience for you.If case you choose a PDF template, it will be delivered to you digitally at the end of the campaign.

We know it's horrible to wait for something we love. Instead of launching on Indiegogo months ago and letting you wait, we diligently prepare our works until today. 5. Q:  What is the LED light panel's power?A: 6 Watt. It is safe to use while providing enough brightness and decoration. 6. Q: What should I do if I have bought one Lamplay and want to buy one more?A: Please simply contribute to one more perk. Or buy a perk with bundle discount. 7. Q: Do I get a discount on the price/shipping fee if I buy more than one Lamplay?A: Try to be an Early Bird and grab steep discounts. For shipping, we already ate up part of the cost to save you money. Please show your support by paying for the shipping cost. There will be a surprise gift in each and every package. 8. Q: What color is the light?A: We offer 2 colors (White and Warm White). We will send out a survey for you to choose soon. 9. Q: What is the Lamplay's size?A: Lamplay's size can be customized to your needs. However, we suggest familiar sizes of 30 x 30 (centimeters), 30 x 40, 40 x 40, 40 x 60, 60 x 60, 60 x 80 ... These sizes have been proven to be all-time favorites. The height will be from 3 to 4 centimeters, depending on the size of Lamplay.10. Q: What type of voltage and plug is it for Lamplay?A: The LED light panel's voltage ranges from 85 to 256V and Lamplay uses two-prong plug. Since the plug and voltage condition vary in different countries, please prepare your own plug adapter and converter if needed. 11. Q: How long is the cord of Lamplay?A: It's 2 meters (6.56 feets)12. Q: Can I change the LED light panel at the back of Lamplay?A: Absolutely! It's an easy process and will not cost you more than 90 seconds. 13. Q: Can I wash Lamplay?A: You can wash the canvas print's surface by using soft fabric to wipe gently with water.14. Q: Will Lamplay be damaged in the shipment process?A: Each Lamplay is covered by 3 layers of protection to minimize damage possibilities:
Corner protectors
Bubble and plastic wrap
Carton box
And we have a policy to exchange a new product if you receive a Lamplay in an undesirable state.15. How many designs that I can choose from?A: After the campaign, we will send out an email survey with 30+ designs and we continuously add new designs weekly. In case that you contribute a Customized Lamplay's perk, we'll quickly send an easy-to-follow guide for you to submit your own design. What can be cooler than having your own personalized Lamplay?16. A. Why does it take 1 year to make Lamplay? Although the result may look simple, we have invested over a year to conceptualize, design, experiment and test the product. Simplicity is elegant. Achieving it is a real struggle. 17. Q: Where is Lamplay made?A: We design and develop Lamplay in Paris (France). The production takes place in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam). 18. Q: I'm a business owner/wholesaler/distributor and would like to sell Lamplay?A: Please contact us at inquiry@artfini.com19. Q: My question is NOT listed here, what should I do?A: Send it to us at inquiry@artfini.com. We love to help.20. Q: ..... [for upcoming questions]",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Homeless &amp; Orphan Pets Exist - H.O.P.E. is a non profit and non-governmental organization which is currently located at Pekan Nanas, Johor. H.O.P.E. was established in April 2008 and was officially registered with the Registry of Societies of Malaysia on August 2009. H.O.P.E. is a 100% NO KILL animal shelter for all breeds of dogs and cats. We are currently sheltering over 2000 homeless cats and dogs. Now, we need a total of 80 bags of 15kg dog food to feed our doggies per day, a total of 2400 bags of 15kg dog food/month! That’s means we have to spend over 40k$ per month for the expense of food itself and also approximately 4k$ – 8k$ on medical bills.</p>

<h3>Vision And Mission</h3>
<p>Our four core missions – rescuing, re-homing, sterilisation and increasing public awareness of pet ownership and responsibilities. An enormous amount of love and care is given to ensure that the animals are happy and healthy. Apart from food and water, like any pet kept in your home, the animals in H.O.P.E. Receive an adequate amount of medical care. All the animals in H.O.P.E. Are sterilised and given regular vaccinations. Our vision is to reduce suffering in the world and advocate humane behaviour through education and provision of rescue, rehabilitation, and shelter to abandoned, neglected, and abused dogs. Hope the Government to have a more stringent legislation to protect and rescue stray pets. Establish a harmonious relationship between man and animals.</p>
<h3>Future Plan</h3>
<p>We planned to build a school rooms and lecture halls where the public and schoolchildren can come to learn about our furry friends, a shop where the public can purchase anything they want for their furry friends. There will be electricity, fresh water and shady places.</p>
<h3>Words From The Founder</h3>

You can attach up to 3 more pots to this pot – simply without drilling. Thanks to the water tank, your plants are supplied with water up to three weeks. Wall greening has never been easier - with Leafy. Why greenery?Plants have a significant influence on your health and life:
they have a relaxing and stress-reducing effect
increase performance and concentration
and simply make happy
They also have proven effects on their environment:
they filter pollutants from the room air
bind carbon dioxide
produce oxygen
and increase humidity
Following studies underline these arguments:NASAPlants can remove toxins from the air - up to 87 percent of volatile organic compounds every 24 hours (NASA research)Texas A&M University""People who keep flowers in their home feel happier, less stressed and more relaxed. As a result of the positive energy they derive from the environment, the chances of suffering from stress-related depression are decreased as well."" (study)Nursery & Garden Industrie Australia""Staff who had plants placed in their offices showed reductions in stress levels and negative feelings of a magnitude of 30 to 60%, while those with no plants recorded increases in stress and negativity of 20 to 40%, over the 3-month test period"" (study) Why wall mounted?Whether living room, kitchen or balcony, wall greening is possible almost everywhere. Our wall greening system is more space-saving than most other planting options and enriches smaller rooms thanks to its flat design. Easy installationCreate your personal wall greening in three simple steps:
Drill two holes into the wall. The best way to do this, is to use the bracket as a template. Make sure that the bracket is almost straight. 
Now attach the bracket to the wall with the supplied screws. Depending on the wall material you may need different dowels. You can use the mini water level for alignment. It's included in every Leafy set. 
Attach the first pot to the bracket. To add another pot simply attach the corresponding bracket to the already mounted pot and hang the next pot onto this bracket. The video below demonstrates how it works. That's it!
 DesignFORM: The simple, rounded design and the concealed bracket keeps Leafy discreetly in the background and puts your plants in the spotlight. FUNCTION: The integrated 500 ml water reservoir and the included water level indicator provides you with a simple and practical way of greening your home. For hanging Leafy outdoors, you may use the overflow, so your plants are save even from heavy rain. FILL: We recommend to use a mineral plant substrate instead of soil to keep your maintenance effort low and your home clean.FUTURE: We care for our environment! Therefore we use high quality Poplyprophylene (PP) for the production of Leafy. PP is one of the most commonly used plastics worldwide.
It is durable

has a long service life

and is 100% recyclable.
What is included?Everything you need to start greening your home! Each set contains:
1 pot
1 mount
1 separator to form the water reservoir
1 water level indicator
1 plug to close the overflow
2 screws with dowels for mounting.
We have some awesome perks that all contain different numbers of our Leafy sets.If something is missing or if you need a custom perk please feel free to contact us: hi@iamleafy.comDo you want to sell Leafy at your local store or webshop? Do you want to green an entire department of your company? Please contact us for business corporation: hi@iamleafy.com What is CrowdfundingWith crowdfunding you contribute to the implementation of a project or idea. In our case we finance the production of Leafy by selling various pot sets (called ""Perks"", find them in the top right-hand corner) in advance. For this we need at least 109.000€, this is the so-called ""funding threshold"". The amounts paid are collected until we reach the funding threshold. If we do not reach this amount, all supporters will get their entire money back and Leafy will not be able to be implemented.At the moment support is only possible by credit card (for EU: only Visa, MasterCard or American Express). Why we need youAfter 1,5 years of designing, developing and prototyping, we are now ready for the next, and most important step. However, we need your help to do so! By supporting us, you will enable us to produce the first batch of our Leafy pots and build the basis for the next generation of wall greenery.Are you ready to take this step with us? Then support our campaign and share the idea with your family and friends! You can contribute a lot with just a few clicks! Timeline  WHAT´S THE MONEY FORWe would like to give you an overview of what we need the money for:Impressions FAQWhat do i get when i order?A small set contains 2 Leafy pots, a medium set contains 3 Leafy pots, and a large set contains 4 Leafy pots. Each Leafy pot comes with a mount, a separator to form the water reservoir, a water level indicator, a plug to close the spillover for indoor use, and two screws for mounting (dowels are not included).What are the dimensions of Leafy?The dimensions are: height 29,5cm x width 30,2cm x depth 12,7cm.
How does Leafy work?Install the mounting bracket to the wall and attach the first pot to the bracket. If you want to add another pot, you can simply attach the corresponding bracket to the already mounted pot and then attach the next pot to this bracket.Where can I use Leafy?You can use Leafy nearly everywhere: at home, in your garden, your Office…When does shipping begin?End of 2018.How much is shipping?Shipping costs 7€ to Germany, 15€ to the rest of EU and 36€ to everywhere else.Is there the possibility for a distribution partnership?Of course! Please contact: hi@iamleafy.comDo I have to pay VAT / GST?Yes, when you live outside the EUIs there a warranty?Every Leafy pot comes with a two-year warranty.What is your refund policy?Refunds are available through Indiegogo at any time during the crowdfunding campaign. After the campaign ends, you will need to email us at hi@iamleafy.com for refunds on a case-by-case basis.What is your return / exchange policy?If you are not satisfied with your product you may exchange it for a new one within 30 days, shipping & handling fees are not included.How can I choose more rewards?You need to make a new contribution for each perk.If I have other questions, who should I contact?If you have any other question, please send an email to hi@iamleafy.comHi, ich bin Leafy!Leafy ist ein modularer Blumentopf mit dem du schnell und unkompliziert verschiedenste Arten von Wandbegrünungen realisieren kannst, egal ob im Innen- oder Außenbereich.Warum Leafy?Die meisten auf  dem Markt erhältlichen Begrünungssysteme sind unhandlich, aufwendig zu installieren, teuer oder nicht problemlos erweiterbar.Mit Leafy haben wir diese Probleme gelöst: Du benötigst nur zwei Schrauben, um den ersten Leafy-Pflanztopf an deiner Wand zu befestigen. An diesem Topf kannst bis zu 3 weitere Töpfe anbringen - ganz einfach und ohne zu bohren. Dank des integrierten Wassertanks sind deine Pflanzen bis zu 3 Wochen mit Wasser versorgt. Noch nie war die Begrünung von Wänden so einfach - mit Leafy. Wozu dient eine Begrünung?Pflanzen haben einen erheblichen Einfluss auf deine Gesundheit und dein Leben:
Sie wirken entspannend und stressmindernd
steigern deine Leistung und Konzentration
und machen glücklich
Sie haben zudem nachweislichen Einfluss auf ihre Umwelt:
Sie filtern Schadstoffe aus der Raumluft
binden Kohlendioxid
produzieren Sauerstoff
und erhöhen die Luftfeuchtigkeit
Die folgenden Studien belegen unsere Argumente:NASAPlants can remove toxins from the air - up to 87 percent of volatile organic compounds every 24 hours (NASA research)Texas A&M University""People who keep flowers in their home feel happier, less stressed and more relaxed.

Unser Wandbegrünungssystem ist platzsparender als die meisten anderen Bepflanzungsmöglichkeiten und findet durch seine flache Bauweise selbst in kleineren Räumen platz. Einfache InstallationDrei einfache Schritte sind notwendig, um deine persönliche Wandbegrünung zu erstellen:
Bohre zwei Löcher an der Stelle in die Wand, an der du den Pflanztopf aufhängen willst. Nutze hierzu die Halterung als Schablone, damit die Löcher an der richtigen Stelle sind. Achte darauf, dass die Halterung nahezu gerade ist. 
Befestige nun die Halterung mit den mitgelieferten Schrauben an der Wand. Je nach Wandmaterial benötigst du eventuell andere Dübel, die du problemlos in jedem Baumarkt erhältst. Nutze die mitgelieferte Mini-Wasserwaage um die Halterung exakt gerade auszurichten. 

Befestige nun den ersten Topf an der Halterung. Wenn du einen weiteren Topf hinzufügen möchten, kannst du einfach die entsprechende Halterung an dem bereits montierten Topf anbringen und dann den nächsten Topf an dieser Halterung aufhängen. Das Video unten zeigt, wie es funktioniert. Das war´s!
 

DesignForm: Das schlichte und unauffällige Design sowie die verdeckt liegende Wandhalterung lässt Leafy dezent im Hintergrund erscheinen und setzt dabei deine Pflanzen perfekt in Szene. Funktionen: Das integrierte 500 ml Wasserreservoir sowie der zugehörige Wasserstandsanzeiger bieten dir eine einfache und praktische Möglichkeit dein zu Hause zu begrünen. Um Leafy außen zu nutzen, öffne ganz einfach den Überlauf, so sind deine Pflanzen auch bei starkem Regen vor Staunässe geschützt. Bepflanzen: Wir empfehlen dir anstelle von Erde ein mineralisches Pflanzensubstrat zu verwenden, so hältst du den Pflegeaufwand gering und dein zu Hause sauber.Zukunft: Unsere Umwelt ist uns wichtig! Deswegen nutzen wir für die Herstellung von Leafy hochwertiges Polyprophylen (PP). PP ist einer der meistgenutzten Kunststoffe weltweit:
Es ist widerstandsfähig

hat eine hohe Nutzungsdauer

und ist zu 100% recyclebar.
Was ist enthalten?Alles was du zum Start benötigst! Jedes einzelne Set enthält:
1 Pflanztopf
1 Halterung
1 Zwischenboden um das Wasserreservoir zu bilden
1 Wasserstandsanzeiger
1 Stopfen um den Überlauf zu verschließen
2 Schrauben mit Dübeln für die Wandmontage

</ol></div>","Featured on Sugar device is a revolutionary tool to control AC Voltage applications,With beautiful design ,and simple connection and control,Sugar is the best tool for a wide range of users such as makers,engineers,students and teachers to learn and build different AC voltage applications projects.Working with AC voltage is very dangerous, connecting AC wire inappropriately may cause electrical shock which could cause death in the worst case.To make it more safe and easy for everyone to control AC voltage application,we designed Sugar to feature an unique mechanical case,offering full protection for the users. Sugar can control AC Voltage in 2 different ways:

As an ON-OFF switch, you can for example turn on/off  an AC  lamp.

As an AC output voltage Control  applications of sugar includes  AC Dimmer,AC Motor speed control,AC Heaters temperature control and more.
  Sugar device Hardware    Sugar device Features                               
Sugar device works with 110V and 220V,sugar also  comes with an internal AC-DC power circuit to power the controlling Circuit inside Sugar device.
Sugar works with 50Hz and 60Hz as well,this is an important feature for AC output control for an applications like AC dimmer Lamp.
With it's protection case,Sugar offers a full protection from high voltage components and makes it easy for  everyone to build their own projects.
                               
To control Sugar device all you need to do is to connect it with your development platforms using RJ12 cable,no need to worry about faults like short circuit any more.
To control Sugar device , you need to send PWM (Pulse width modulation) from your development platforms, that's make controlling AC Voltage so simple and easy to integrate with any development platforms (Arduino,Raspberry pi,Ti,etc).
The data signal can be either 3.3V or 5V so you can control it from 3.3V development platforms like Raspberry Pi or from 5V development platforms like Arduino Uno,Mega .. etc.
                                     Sugar device works with many AC applications such as,AC lamps,dimmer lamps,AC induction motors,AC water heater,AC wall adapter and more.Meet the Sugar device familySugar device comes with 2 different types to meet different project requirements:

Sugar 300 : With white color,can control up to 300W,ideal for beginners and educational purpose.

Sugar 1000 : With black color , can control Up to 1000W,ideal for makers  and professional with advance applications 
           Sugar is designed for :  Sugar  is made for everyone! Educational institute , college students, hobbyists, teachers, instructors , working professional, engineers or anybody who loves building and developing DIY projects , Sugar is an ideal tool for  creative projects , it is cost effective but most importantly it keeps you safe.  Sugar works with many electronics development platforms

Once the bowl is tipped over, your baby loses a chance to learn self-feeding. So... Still looking for baby bowls with SUPER SUCTION?? You are so lucky that you met ICEMY :):):) The suction cup at the bottom prevents ICEMY from sliding or flipping over. Now you see how strong the suction is. ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓

The super suction cup was created after numerous trials in forming the best geometrical design. It attaches not only onto glass but also plastic and even wood. It’s great for using them on highchairs or tables.  Does my baby really need their own bowl?☞ Absolutely, YES!!Teaching self-feeding is very important. By six months of age, most infants will have developed sufficient motor skills to be able to feed themselves rather than needing to be spoon-fed by an adult (Daniels, L. et al., 2015). In 2002, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the best age for starting complementary feeding should be at six months. The majority of babies who were able to self-feed with a spoon at an earlier age (9-11 months) had higher intake of energy, macronutrients, thiamin, vitamin B-6, magnesium, and zinc in comparison than those who did not (Carruth, B. R. et al., 2004). Therefore, your six month old baby should have a bowl and spoon of their own.  Then, does the bowl must have suction cup?☞ For your baby's better growth, SURE. It MUST!!The most frustrating part of self-feeding training that occurs too many times is when bowls are tipped over or thrown. Once the bowl is flipped over, your baby loses a chance to learn self-feeding.  Do not miss the valuable opportunity to learn self-feeding. ICEMY will be a tool for your child to work towards mastering the skill of feeding themselves.ReferencesCarruth, B. R. et al. (2004). Developmental Milestones and Self-Feeding Behaviors in Infants and Toddlers. The American Dietetic Association, 104, 1.Daniels, L. et al. (2015).

<p>Here on our side, it's a bit more complicated. We need your support to prepare Chaotic-Tock for mass production and there are other expenses as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have budget for larger orders of plexiglass and other materials. That would make our product cheaper.</li>
<li>Pay-it-back. We've been doing everything with almost no budget whatsoever. We were lucky to have people around us that were willing to do their awesome part for free. If this campaign is successful, we have unwritten obligations to reward their effort and pay for their expenses.</li>
<li>Buy our own tools. We do everything without even the most basic tools like a multimeter or oscilloscope. We don't even have a decent camera to make pictures of our products - we had to borrow one to share Chaotic-Tock with you.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441821828/jvyusotygaddbkqcmteg.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Do you use old motors in every new clock?</b><br/>
    No. We only used salvaged motors in the first, wooden prototype. The new clocks use a pair of new, more reliable and very common stepper motors.
  </li>
<li>
<b>Can I power this clock with batteries?</b><br/>
    No way! You would have to change them at least once a week. The clock comes with a 3m long white cable. The cable plugs in on the back side of the clock which means it can be totally invisible if properly installed.
  </li>
<li>
<b>How do you set the time?</b><br/>
    That's what the three buttons labeled H M C are for. For more info, check the <a href=""http://chaotic-tock.damogranlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/UserManual.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">user manual on the official website</a><a href=""http://chaotic-tock.damogranlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/UserManual.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a>.

It also makes your mouth smile while watching others struggle with it.It's a big thing: 35 cm wide x 29 cm high and about 5cm thick (that's about 14 x 12 x 2 inches). If you plan to mount it on a wall, the holes are exactly 300mm apart (11 13/16 in).
The TeamWe are Damogran Labs, a young startup company from Slovenia. There's us, the two brothers - mechanical and electrical engineer, a designer and a marketing guy.
Chaotic-Tock is one of the projects we have been working on for the last 3 years. We have other cool projects, but this is the most evolved and we chose it to start our business.
The Deal
It's all very simple on your side. Here are your options:


€2: Chaotic Contributor.
Thank you for supporting us and all the pleasant chaos we are about to unleash upon the world with the clock. Your name will be listed in an online memorial page. Forever.


€25: A T-Shirt.
You get this cool T-shirt with a precise drawing of the planet Damogran and its orbit around something. You won't only look supercool wearing it, you'll also be a part of our story with this project and others as well.



€100: An Early Bird!*
Get your own Chaotic-Tock at a special, early bird price. Only the first 20 contributors get this price!


€140: A Chaotic-Tock.*
A very, truly yours Chaotic-Tock, assembled by hand and with love in Damogran Labs, Slovenia. You can choose the color as well!

€180: A Customized Chaotic-Tock.*There is a certain degree of freedom when cutting base plate and gears. We'll do it for you for a little extra gravy - check out the customization page on the site!



Here on our side, it's a bit more complicated. We need your support to prepare Chaotic-Tock for mass production and there are other expenses as well:

Have budget for larger orders of plexiglass and other materials. That would make our product cheaper.
Pay-it-back. We've been doing everything with almost no budget whatsoever. We were lucky to have people around us that were willing to do their awesome part for free. If this campaign is successful, we have unwritten obligations to reward their effort and pay for their expenses.
Buy our own tools. We do everything without even the most basic tools like a multimeter or oscilloscope. We don't even have a decent camera to make pictures of our products - we had to borrow one to share Chaotic-Tock with you.


The Risky Bits

Our chaotic-prototype has been running since the beginning of May 2015 and is still turning very happily.That said, there's not many things that could wrong to prevent you from getting what you crave. There could be a delay if we somehow got too many orders, but that's just a delay - it wears out sooner or later.
The Timeline
There is no timeline. You get your rewards a month after a successful campaign. It couldn't get much simpler.
OK, OK, if you really want a timeline, it's something like this:

August 17: Campaign starts
September 30: campaign ends

October 31: your reward is on the way.




Frequently Asked Questions


Do you use old motors in every new clock?
    No. We only used salvaged motors in the first, wooden prototype. The new clocks use a pair of new, more reliable and very common stepper motors.
  

Can I power this clock with batteries?
    No way! You would have to change them at least once a week. The clock comes with a 3m long white cable. The cable plugs in on the back side of the clock which means it can be totally invisible if properly installed.
  

How do you set the time?
    That's what the three buttons labeled H M C are for. For more info, check the user manual on the official website. In the future, we have plans to make it radio controlled, but that wouldn't work everywhere in the world.

Enough Chaos Already?
If you like the Chaotic-Tock but for some reason won't participate in this campaign, please feel free to share it among your friends and people that might be interested.
You might even dislike it! But we would never believe such a nonsense.

800 mirrors for €499 each 
100 pairs of mirrors for €899, that’s a 10% discount 

 
In the unfortunate case that we don’t meet our campaign goal, all contributions will be fully refunded. But let’s not make that happen!
By ordering your Axiom Smart Mirror you are contributing to the success and the livelihoods of a small group of talented and creative people that really dream and wish to launch a cool product to the world - and to see you, the end users happy with that product. 


It's always a challenge to bring a project through to production, but we have experienced product managers and industrial designers on our team that are familiar with the processes of production. That said there are always surprises and we will endeavour to meet the challenges that we face and keep our backers informed. We strive for excellence and will make sure that every effort is made to deliver the premium product that we envisioned.
Some challenges and considerations are, screen brightness or rather contrast. The screen backlight visibility. Availability of frameless panels of a good size, say 22"". Getting the reflective coating of the mirror just right so that it lets enough of the screen image through, but not too much, and still looks like a good mirror for everyday use. These and other things are challenges we are working on with a positive attitude to getting the product as good as possible.

</div></div>","Introduction / (THE PROBLEM): 

My name is Bill Sagona, I am the Founder, President and CEO of Sunshine Network Homes, Inc. (A Delaware C corporation) The reason I started this company, a highly scalable truly affordable and sustainable housing model was for multiple reasons. First, because I was appalled at the number of people in this country whom are either living in their cars and or are homeless living on the streets out in the cold. Another main reason was because I did not see any viable solutions out there that could solve our affordable housing crises at scale fast. In addition, too many people; America's work force, incomes are not keeping pace with the high cost of housing and overall living expenses. And lastly, because I personally could not find any decent, affordable housing in my own home town of Bend Oregon where the average cost of a home is $575,000 - $3,400,000.

People Are HUNGRY, SCARED & HURTING:
There are 38,000,000 people are on food assistance programs within the U.S. This number is obviously much greater now due to our global pandemic COVID19. Approximately 60,000,000 people in the U.S alone have now filed for unemployment government assistance due to our economy being shut down. In addition, we are still seeing approximately 850,000 people filing for unemployment claims every week.
 
Tragedy unfolding:
 
While HUD said ""it counted 114,829 homeless kids younger than 18, the Education Department reported 1.3 million homeless children in public schools during the same time in the 2016-2017 school year""
 

 

 
 

​People line up for miles, waiting hours in their cars just to get food to feed their families

People standing in long lines waiting hours to apply for unemployment insurance

OUR INSPIRATION:
Our timely and highly scalable business model is very unique compared to all other housing models in existence. Inspired by the SEARS & ROEBUCK kit home ,Henry Ford Model-T assembly line and  . . .
. . . Dick and Mack McDonalds brothers whom built the worlds first fast food restaurant, that was located at 14th & E street in San Bernardino CA, just 2-blocks from my grandmothers home located at Evans & E street three houses down on left side of street, a CA bungalow style. (""A hamburger in 30-seconds not 30-minutes"") We ate there regularly when my sisters and I would visit our grandmother from our home in the city next door, Rialto. The fries then were extra yummy, because they were fried in chicken fat, great for the taste buds, but bad for the heart. See movie The Founder / true story.

<p><i><strong>Love the start of a new season!</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>FIRST SEASON</strong></i>  brings together the love of sports and the life changing experience of adding children to a family. Our one of kind baby swings gives sports fans long lasting memories of swinging moments with their new child!</p>
<p>My name is Mike Putnam.  I have spent my 20 year career in the events, marketing and advertising industry.  When I was a kid, I loved playing and following sports.  Now as a father of two involved in youth sports, enjoying the game through my kid’s eyes makes me appreciate the impact sports has had on me and my family’s life.  We could not be more excited than to have the opportunity to be involved with a business that intersects with the priceless moments between parents and their children.</p>

<p>A little over two years ago my wife Lisa and I came up with the idea for<strong> <i>First Season</i></strong> while opening gifts on Christmas.  My nephew opened up a gift upside down.  It was a football helmet and as he pulled it out, Lisa said;</p>

</h3><p>Decades of research from Harvard Medical School, NASA, and leading institutions around the world have revealed a great deal of information about how light impacts and regulates our health. We designed Ario based on this large body of knowledge and on recommendations of the National Institute of Health and American Medical Association. Here is a summary.</p><p><strong>Our body learns what time it is from light in our environment.</strong> Non-visual photoreceptors in our eyes, discovered fairly recently, are sensitive to changing levels of blue light from above. These receptors provide signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a tiny region located in the hypothalamus responsible for controlling our circadian rhythm, or body clock. This in turn influences the production of hormones regulating bodily process.</p><p><strong>Today’s static artificial lights throw off our body clock by as much as three hours. </strong>While we don’t perceive this directly, this changes the balance of our endocrine system, generally reducing levels of body process regulating hormones both day and night. These changes to our basic physiology affect our metabolism which in turn impacts our sleep, behavior, mood, and general health.</p><p><strong>Medical and lighting professionals recommend the following</strong> to promote healthy circadian rhythm, restful sleep, and overall well-being. Ario is designed to deliver what is recommended: </p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Blue-rich light</strong> from above stimulates <strong>cortisol</strong> production in the morning to synchronize circadian rhythm and awaken, and during the day to maintain alertness.</li>
<li>
<strong>Amber-toned light</strong> with very little blue and a relatively dark ceiling, at the end of the day. This makes it easier to relax and prepare the body for sleep by facilitating the release of the hormone <strong>melatonin</strong> which is inhibited by typical light exposure at night.</li>

This is unnatural and has significant implications to our sleep, mood, immune system, weight management, and overall well-being. Ario FeaturesIn the PressArio in ActionArio’s high-performance LEDs provide bright, 2400 lumen output and a wide color range, from 6500K blue-rich light (mid-day sun) to 1800K amber light (candle/fire light).Ario provides a natural way to wake up when you want to, with gently increasing light.​ Ario  provides blue-rich light, energizing you like a sunny day while working at home.Ario's calming amber light creates a relaxing atmosphere.​  Ario's downward-directed light prepares you for sleep. Ario can turn itself off or act as a nightlight that won't disturb sleep. MOBILE & WEB ACCESSEverything the physical controls do and more! You are in control of how to start and live your day.

You can control Ario via physical buttons, wall switch, or the Ario app on your phone, tablet, or PC.EFFICIENCY & LONGEVITYArio’s solid-state LEDs use only 1/5 the energy of equivalent incandescent lights. Ario’s state-of-the-art LEDs and heat sink deliver >35,000 hours of life. Science Behind Ario
Decades of research from Harvard Medical School, NASA, and leading institutions around the world have revealed a great deal of information about how light impacts and regulates our health. We designed Ario based on this large body of knowledge and on recommendations of the National Institute of Health and American Medical Association. Here is a summary.Our body learns what time it is from light in our environment. Non-visual photoreceptors in our eyes, discovered fairly recently, are sensitive to changing levels of blue light from above. These receptors provide signals to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a tiny region located in the hypothalamus responsible for controlling our circadian rhythm, or body clock. This in turn influences the production of hormones regulating bodily process.Today’s static artificial lights throw off our body clock by as much as three hours. While we don’t perceive this directly, this changes the balance of our endocrine system, generally reducing levels of body process regulating hormones both day and night. These changes to our basic physiology affect our metabolism which in turn impacts our sleep, behavior, mood, and general health.Medical and lighting professionals recommend the following to promote healthy circadian rhythm, restful sleep, and overall well-being. Ario is designed to deliver what is recommended: 

Blue-rich light from above stimulates cortisol production in the morning to synchronize circadian rhythm and awaken, and during the day to maintain alertness.

Amber-toned light with very little blue and a relatively dark ceiling, at the end of the day. This makes it easier to relax and prepare the body for sleep by facilitating the release of the hormone melatonin which is inhibited by typical light exposure at night.

For kids aged 2+, but anyone who loves stories could get Neo home. 
                 We created 'Neo' a toy for kids to listen to stories and a companion mobile app for parents and family to create, share and discover new stories and connect with a community of parents who believe in the power of storytelling.Kids listen to stories delivered by Neo without using a mobile app. Neo talks to kids and tells them jokes and trivia.Connect Neo to your Home WIFI - with a simple one-time setup process using our app. It is easy to send a story to Neo.Record your own story - Record a story in your own voice on our mobile app and send it to Neo over the internet.ORPick a story from the app - Pick a story from our mobile app and Neo will narrate it to your child. These stories are pre-recorded audio books by storytellers.   Neo downloads and delivers stories to kids - Neo can talk and tells kids it has a new story. Kids press a button on Neo to listen to new stories.     I think it's a great idea. Makes it easier on single parents to have an aide to help tuck their kids in at bedtime.  - Chris, Dad. I am glad that you have come with a toy rather than using cell phone app directly for kids  - Ekta, Mother. I am a pilot and am not usually home for bedtime stories. This can help me read my kids bedtime stories when I am travelling"" - Samir, Dad  Playing with physical toys helps spark kids imagination, nurtures their social and creative skills.Today's toys need to be smart to interest kids and keep up with the new digital experiences. That does not mean every toy needs to morph into a mobile phone or a tablet. We were inspired by the 90's cult hit ‘Toy Story’ characters and brought alive Social Toys, toys on the internet with an explicit human connection.Social toys help re-kindle the connection with 'digital' kids and connect the entire family.Storytelling has always been at the core of parenting and fuels the power of imagination in a child.Neo the monster takes it one step forward helping the child bond with family despite the modern day pressures of time and physical availability.Every family has  stories to be passed on to the next generation. There are so many beautiful undiscovered stories even today. We want to bring together a community of story tellers and parents who believe in story telling. With Neo they can create and share new stories with the community. We prototyped 'Neo' using off the shelf components in early 2015. The next year and half was spent creating a delightful, stable, safe and manufacturable product.Our team went through multiple iterations of the electronic board design and selection of components.After we developed the electronics, we worked with the toy designer duo of Suhasini Paul and Paul Sandip to design the character and used prototyping techniques like 3D printing, CNC milling to create the physical prototype. We successfully carried out a small batch production of 40 units of the toy in 2016 to put our assumptions to test.Late 2016 we tested these toys with interested users as a part of our beta test and incorporated their feedback to improve the product.We are now ready to take the design and the electronics to the manufacturers for production.All we need is your help to make this campaign successful.      We have taken the utmost care to not collect any information unless its absolutely necessary for the purpose of a feature of the toy.No information shall be collected without the consent of parents.We do not store any information about kids as we understand, kids privacy needs to be respected.Parents have complete control over any information we collect and we promise to be transparent about it.We have worked with internet security specialists to ensure security and safety of the toy and we are always committed to this cause.   The funds cover the initial cost of production of the toys.

Once it’s online, it can take orders from your phone over the internet. Those orders are then sent via Bluetooth to the Geniis.What are the Geniis?The Geniis relay orders to your devices. They do this by shooting out infrared beams - just like your remotes do.So for example, if you wanted to control your TV with our app, you’d stick a Genii either on it or near it (the Geniis need to “see” the devices’ infrared receiver). The Geniis are battery operated, with battery life estimated at around two years.So I’m in China, and I want to turn my TV on in San Jose. Give me the blow-by-blow.Sure. You launch the Genii app on your phone and select the TV tab. Here, you tap “On,” just as you would if you were using your remote back home.Using either WiFi or a data connection, our app establishes a link with the Genii Hub you’ve installed back at your place. The Genii Hub gets the request, and sends it by Bluetooth to the appropriate Genii. In this case, it’s the one that you placed on your TV.The Genii gets the request from the Hub and sends an infrared beam to your TV, turning it on. Mission accomplished: now anyone passing by your house will think you’re right at home.Can I use the phone app to control the Geniis directly?You can indeed - but without a Genii Hub, your phone will need to be within Bluetooth range of the Geniis.How many Geniis will I need?That depends on how many devices you want to control. Each Genii can communicate with a single device.What about Genii Hubs?You’ll only need one of those. Since the Genii Hub uses Bluetooth, it can communicate with Geniis that are anywhere nearby - line-of-sight is not required. (Other smart-home hubs fire IR beams, which means they can only control the devices they can “see” - i.e., forget about turning the TV upstairs on).What does the standard Genii package come with?Our standard package comes with the Genii Hub and 3 Geniis. The app will be available on Google Play and iTunes (at no extra charge, of course).You can also purchase a package without the hub - i.e., 3 Geniis. See our perks for prices.What colors does Genii come in?An elegant white or a stylish black.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>When starting a new company, there are many risks that comes with the adventure. Although we try to plan for any obstacles that may come our way, we are all vulnerable to unforeseen hurdles. One of the obstacles we may incur is the time it takes to develop the software. If the development of the software takes longer than expected, it could push the delivery time back. If this happens, we are willing to give a discount on the product to the customers who purchased the device during this campaign. But we will work very hard to stay on schedule. Another obstacle we may face is the supplier may run into unforeseen issues that slows down production, or even bring it to a stop. Sometimes, these issues can't be helped, but we are willing to work with our customers on the best resolution for everyone involved.</p>

<p>Yes, we know what you're thinking; <i>Aren't there already solutions and companies dealing with smart home systems? </i>And to be honest, yes there are. However, Aria is nothing like other companies out there. We truly care about our community.</p>
<p>There are 3 main aspects that Aria focuses on to deliver the best smart products in the market:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fully Functional Products</li>
<li>Beautifully Designed Products</li>
<li>Low Cost/Affordable Products</li>

<p><strong>Functional Products</strong></p>
<p>Most of the solutions out there focus on one main thing, and that is to deliver a functional product. This is of course the most important aspect of a smart product, as it has to work and perform the <strong>whole set of features</strong> it is designed to. However, we believe that many companies take advantage of this aspect and end up charging homeowners for features that should be straightforward.</p>
<p>A smart light bulb, for example, is meant to have some standard features such as being dimmable or remotely controlled. But making these features certainly does not justify the high price of some existing light bulbs out there. There is no reason to spend $50 on a single light bulb and we noticed that these high price tags were stopping many homeowners from making their homes smart. Our products are carefully designed to meet our functionality requirements, as well as maintaining a level of sophistication that is worthy of showcasing in your home. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561698919/wg7fxfl0gdwg8tmtjdaw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Beautifully Designed</strong></p>
<p>There are also other products out there that provide the required functionality but compared to our standards, they do a poor design execution. We are strong believers that presentation is a very important aspect of every product and for that reason we have taken extra time to carefully design all of our products. We want to offer products that you will be proud of owning, and not something that just performs a set of functions. </p>
<p>This is what differentiates Aria from other competitive products as <strong>we design our products to be showcased and displayed</strong>, and not hidden away because they are bulky, basic or simply dull. Not only does Aria offer a wide variety of products, but also with its <strong>modern</strong> and <strong>elegant </strong>design you will no longer have to do a trade-off between design and functionality.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561699194/iozxi2gzuttjbr57b56n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Products Are Affordable!</strong></p>
<p>The main goal of Aria is not only to offer beautiful and functional products, but also offer them at a very low cost. We do not believe in over-charging or making our customers have to spend in additional equipment to make their products work. We believe that whatever comes in the box should already be plug-and-play and ready to go. For this reason all of Aria's products work via WiFi and most importantly without a hub. And even better, our products are <strong>up to half the price </strong>than other products on the market right now. </p>
<p>As a sample use case, picture yourself upgrading the light bulbs in your bedroom with smart light bulbs. You want to pick multi-color lights to be able to set the lighting in your bedroom to different colors. An average bedroom has 5 light bulbs, so doing this calculation:</p>

<h3>We Are The Complete Solution</h3>
<p>Aria is meant to be your last stop to make your home modern. Why are you going to spend time and effort looking for the <strong>best deal </strong>or lowest-cost products if Aria already offers that to you. Sure you can look around and find smart devices that are affordable, but you will end up buying different products, all from different companies, all manufactured in different places and worst of all they all come with their own software or proprietary app. <strong>Aria solves all of these issues</strong> by offering a wide range of products, at the most affordable price and the best user experience. And best of all, our apps work with every major operating system and smart assistants.</p>

<p>Our products do not require a hub for you to take control of your home. This is what sets us apart from many other smart products out there which require you to purchase a separate hub in addition to paying for your smart products.

You can then remotely control them through our mobile apps which will help you detach from physically controlling your devices.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

Canines are now dealing with more soft tissue injuries and pain issues than ever before. Until now, there has not been an OTC product to address both arthritis and soft tissue damage.</p>
<p>Forte Flex K9 is formulated to address both joint and soft tissue issues specific to dogs. Most joint products on the market focus only on the joints. Ours is the only canine product designed to help with both joints and soft tissue damage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Helps relieve discomfort with our proprietary blend of ingredients that work as a natural pain reliever and anti-inflammatory, while supporting the healing process of soft tissue.</li>
<li>Increases mobility in canines with pre-existing issues like arthritis, hip dysplasia, and ligament issues, such as ACL injuries</li>
<li>Studies show that dogs using Forte Flex K9 experience a visible change in mobility in under 30 days</li>
<li>Pre-purchasing Forte Flex K9 today will enable the production process to be put into place much more quickly, which means the product will be available to assist your pet much sooner.</li>
