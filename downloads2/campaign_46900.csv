It offers users a new way to express themselves by featuring a wide range of images, symbols, or hashtags to choose from. This fashionable device can accentuate your personality and share your style with the world. It is an aide that shares online activities while socializing in an offline setting. It is a rebirth of an icon from our adolescence, the pinned badge.This wearable's ability to feature images and art offers users a new way to express themselves.  Screens today are designed to face the user. Badger faces outward. Why?The same reason people wear a t-shirt of their favorite band or have a sports team on their phone case. In either context, you are signaling to the public that you are interested in that topic and you wouldn't mind if a person nearby talked to you about it. With Badger, this concept can be amplified by being able to swap images or hashtags on the fly. Since we were kids, an indispensable part of our clothing culture was a pinned badge because it was hip, modern, rebellious and a great way to express our views. With the emerging popularity of throwback fashions, the Badger is positioned to bridge the divide between classic styles and new trends.Upgrade all you wear. ShareWe have domain expertise in areas that cover engineering, design, and marketing so it was natural to combine ideas and creativity into a wearable for personal, business, and branding purposes.  How did we settle on naming the Badger? The animal is resilient, fearless and energetic, just as our team. This is set to become the 21st century electronic badge.The Apple Watch makes using a smartphone better. Fitbits are for health. GoPros are for videos. The Badger will be used for building networks based on person-to-person interactions.  Your offline avatar.Our goal is to offer a simple and fashionable device that complements your personality. Our team is working to design a device that will draw everyone's attention to the user, no matter the occasion. From idea and concept to final designThe interactive computer HAL 9000 from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was an inspiration behind the initial design.But don't worry, the Badger will never say: ""I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"". Instead it would become your faithful companion.
 The Badger is an exciting combination of an open display and iconic fashion accessory, the pinned badge.  Those who want to communicate directly with their surroundings wear descriptions on shirts, backpacks and other accessories. The Badger offers you the ability to make a style or business statement by allowing you to feature your favorite images, hashtags, or social media accounts. Wear Your FashionThe Badger allows users to change the display's artwork through an app to better match your wardrobe. Express yourself in a new way, become a designer, make your fashion visible, add flair to your attire, and share your creations with the community. The device's display enables you to tell others about yourself without saying a word. It invites you to create a community whether you are shy or an extrovert.The Badger aspires to dress, express and impress. The Badger is a new fashion icon. It is your style shared with the world through messages, designs, and animations.This is your offline social network. CONFERENCE Remove misinformation and confusion while avoiding delays and awkwardness at networking events. As you walk into the conference or convention, you will receive the Badger uploaded with all of your business contact information.You will no longer have to wait in line for your name tag and personal info during conferences. No more misinformation and confusion. No more frustrating delays when you network at events. The Badger replaces ugly lanyards, paper name tags, and boring business cards commonly seen at these venues.Along with your data, the Badger can show slides of your products, and even interact with others with similar interests.  It is an exciting new tool to present yourself and market yourself. Saves time for conference attendees/speakers/organizers and money for the conference/hotel industry because it replaces name tags, advertisement pins, and bulky materials. RALLIES  In political campaigns, the Badger will be used to portray not only your candidate, but also a whole range of feelings, messages, and symbols unimaginable to a static, classic badge. Wear Your Slogan CONCERTS  How about wearing album artwork of your favorite band before you see them next Friday?With the Badger you will be able to express your rebellious taste in music within your family or group of friends.  There are many more possible uses of our device such as: weddings, birthdays, dates, mixers, campus events, and public gatherings.So far everything we create or post online is generating profit for large companies. Why not reverse that? We are introducing a new, Personal Advertising Solution (PAS) as a feature within the Badger. The PAS will allow users to make money by advertising a campaign during social events and conferences, while making money from linking online activities to offline settings.Based on the interest of an advertiser, you will be offered opportunities to promote a cause or share a product with the Badger wearable acting as mediator during the process. This new approach offers you the chance to make money on the go. It was about time to empower users and make their activities profitable. When fully developed you will download our mobile app to discover the full potential of the Badger device. This is a sneak peek of the process of choosing, adjusting, and loading content on the device.Initial industrial designCurrent industrial designGrowing up and then working together our team dreamed about giving new life to our childhood fashion landmark, the pinned badge.

Today, although he is still involved in overseeing operations in his companies, he dedicates much of his time mentoring young entrepreneurs and helping local startup communities.As we worked on The Badger from idea concept to the first design, it became clear that Indiegogo was the best destination to share our project in order to help generate funds and to further validate our concept.As we conducted polls and research during this process, we've found that many are interested in wearables, but there isn't any wearable device today that truly defines the industry in the same way iPhone defines mobiles. With the Badger's partnership and third-party connectivity capabilities, this is a wearable unlike any other. Indiegogo embraces such models and was our logical choice. Be a part of the future communication trends.Purchase The Badger, show your creativity to the world and wear your heart now!If you are interested in writing about us and our mission please download our press kit.Thank you for your support!Our challenge lies in finding adequate funds for the final product as well as setting up and managing a supply chain.In order to ensure quality, efficiency and productivity we have narrowed down two options:1.

<h3>Crease Free Clothes</h3>
<p>Using our patented rolling technology, our bags allow you to transport your clothes crease free. By rolling, the bag also becomes more compact, and easy to carry through airports and on to a plane as carry-on.</p>
<h3>Move Freely</h3>
<p>Unlike other travel luggage on the market, your Henty CoPilot will allow you to move freely whilst carrying. With a Henty CoPilot, you're free to move with your hands free, meaning you can jump on a bike share, walk through parks or even run without worrying about wasting time returning to your hotel to pickup your luggage! </p>

Jeremy Grey developed a prototype bag to solve this problem for his commute to work in Sydney, Australia. The concept worked well, so he and childhood friend Jon Gourlay founded Henty and set about to hone the design and commercialize the bag.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>That first prototype evolved into The Wingman – a multi-purpose suit and garment bag which allows users to transport their work wardrobe with ease.</p>
<p>Today, Henty is proud to be a leading, sustainable company based in Tasmania, Australia, creating innovative products based on a “carry clever” ethos and selling them around the world.</p>
<h3>The Story behind Our Story</h3>
<p>Jeremy and Jon cycle to work, fly often and exercise daily.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about that time you struggled to pack your clothes when you walked, cycled or had to catch a plane? Chances are your clothes and belongings were jammed into a small backpack, suit bag or carry-on bag and arrived at your destination all creased and wrinkled. Or what about the time you decided to go to the gym or ride to work?</p>

<p>Henty was founded in Tasmania, Australia’s island state. Named after a remote area on the state’s rugged west coast, on the edge of the renowned Wilderness World Heritage Area. It’s home to diverse coastal and inland trails and has some of the cleanest air in the world.</p>

</div>","RE.BIN offers an easy way to recycle in style. MADE IN VERMONT, from 100% recycled plastic, RE.BIN is designed to be used with standard paper grocery bags for an easy, clean, sustainable recycling experience. 
RE.BIN promotes sustainability through a functional, innovative design that makes recycling more convenient for everyone. RE.BIN is perfect for anyone who is busy and tight on time.
Founded by an environmental lawyer with an eye for design, RE.BIN has set out to craft elegant, practical home products that allow consumers to keep sustainability at the center of their life.







 




 







    

 

 

 

                    

 

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Americans had a 34.3% recycling rate in 2013. Americans accumulated nearly 254 million tons of trash in 2013, but only recycled or composted about 87 million tons. With RE.BIN, it’s easier for you to recycle and do your part to protect the environment.


 At RE.BIN, we believe sustainability isn’t just a concept, it’s a value. We also believe that big change starts small. That’s why we strive to promote sustainability through functional, innovative design – to make eco-friendly living a simple, intuitive, attractive choice for everyone.
We made RE.BIN because we believe recycling should be easy, and that you shouldn’t have to compromise style to make a difference in the world. We crafted RE.BIN with the highest attention paid to minimizing its ecological footprint. RE.BIN is made right here in the USA - when you choose RE.BIN, you can rest assured that you’re choosing sustainability too.

 

 
Whitney Ferrell is an Environmental Attorney and the founder of RE.BIN. Whitney founded RE.BIN after three years of practicing environmental law with the Environmental Integrity Project (EIP), a public interest law firm in Washington D.C. RE.BIN is a culmination of Whitney’s two passions: the environmental and her love of design.
Whitney is admitted to the State Bars of Florida, Colorado, and the District of Columbia. She holds an LL.M. in Environmental and Natural Resources Law from Lewis & Clark Law School, a J.D. from the University of Denver Sturm College of Law, and a B.A. in Art History from the University of Virginia.




OUR DESIGN PROCESS & THE EVOLUTION OF RE.BINOver the past few years, we have taken RE.BIN from an idea to a production-ready product. We worked through several prototypes, meticulously researched recycled plastics, and visited manufacturers all across the U.S. before finding one that meets our sustainability standards. Now that RE.BIN has been successfully funded on Kickstarter, we are so excited and grateful to be able to share our project with you through InDemand! We know RE.BIN will make recycling easier for everyone, and we believe this will encourage recycling across all major U.S. cities. That's why we're so excited to begin manufacturing and deliver RE.BIN to you!

<p>Hello everybody, I’m Stefania Gagliardone and I am the founder of Keep Out. Keep Out is a Jewelry brand, mainly producing jewelry out of silver, in particular, bracelets.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Keep out is just a start up: I founded it 4 years ago when I randomly found out about an intriguing story from Latin America that tells grandmas would gift a thimble to their sons, nieces and relatives once they would leave the house. The thimble was considered a token of good luck and protection, that keeps all the things that sting you away from your life.I was very fascinated by this particular story. Plus, I’m also quite stubborn so I underwent this crazy idea of creating a company whose recurrent symbol is the thimble.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The bracelet we would like to realise with the crowdfunding is called Shot. It is made out of eco-friendly silicone. We have no intention of harming mother nature: this is indeed a very sensitive issue nowadays. That’s why we chose a company that could produce our bracelets in an eco-friendly material. Secondly, it is a colourful bracelet and just given the fact that it protects you and brings you some good luck I think it’s worth it to support this project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since I started this company, we also always wanted to contemplate social responsibility. For this reason, I will briefly talk about the city where I live: Casale Monferrato. Due to historical reasons, a considerable amount of asbestos, the main cause of the poorest mesothelioma, is present in Casale. Since our beginning, for a very personal reason, I have decided to support VITAS, a nonprofit organisation that accompanies terminal patients till the last day of his/her life. I think this is a marvellous project. For each bracelet bought, one euro is then donated to Vitas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I thank you for your time and patience and ask you to go have a look at our website and at the story of Keep Out, just get into the Keep Out world and see what’s our world!</p>

<p>Enko gives you unique shock absorption that no other shoe can. Impact is deadened, your stride is smooth and the sensation is like never before.</p>
<p>To optimise this revolutionary system of shock absorption, your shoe is delivered to you with shock absorbers that are adapted to your weight, guaranteeing you record-beating comfort that is far superior to that of any other shoe.</p>
<p>Your joints will thank you.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Enko is a revolutionary running shoe which, with its two shock absorbers, conserves all the energy stored in each stride. With a normal shoe, when your foot touches the ground, the energy is dissipated and completely lost.</p>
<p>By contrast, ENKO stores up the energy and gives it back when you lift your heel off the ground again.</p>
<p>Your running becomes extremely efficient.</p>

which provide it with significant cushioning (increased comfort) and energy
release (increased performance).</p>
<p>The innovative sole is equipped with two shock-absorbers,

HIGH PERFORMANCESHOCK ABSORPTION

Enko is a new type of running shoes, based on a unique and revolutionary technology. It is a new racing experience that gives you more power and operating comfort.This revolutionary shoe is to keep all the energy in your approach, while bringing you forward.When the foot hits the ground, with a classic shoe, the energy is dispersed and completely lost. Enko Running shoes that returns energy with every stride.It is a perfect running shoe that adapts to the weight of the driver, designed to prevent injuries and provide total comfort. It is the result of an avid runner Christian Freschi. His knowledge of metal engineering (profession) and dozens of prototypes for 12 years of research, made it all possible.Why buy this running shoe?

To protect your health with its exceptional shock absorption



It is the only market that adjusts the weight of the user


It optimizes the process, reduces fatigue and allows you to run effortlessly longer.


It fits all running styles


Quite simply, it gives pleasure running


Your joints will thank you

Enko gives you unique shock absorption that no other shoe can. Impact is deadened, your stride is smooth and the sensation is like never before.
To optimise this revolutionary system of shock absorption, your shoe is delivered to you with shock absorbers that are adapted to your weight, guaranteeing you record-beating comfort that is far superior to that of any other shoe.
Your joints will thank you.

Maximum energy


Enko is a revolutionary running shoe which, with its two shock absorbers, conserves all the energy stored in each stride. With a normal shoe, when your foot touches the ground, the energy is dissipated and completely lost.
By contrast, ENKO stores up the energy and gives it back when you lift your heel off the ground again.
Your running becomes extremely efficient.






SHOCK ABSORBERS

The springs are interchangeable depending on your weight.


They are available in the 10 kilograms of ranges:

                                                   
Your shoes will be delivered based on the weight that you provide.
The shock absorbers are interchangeable, based on your weight. You can buy different sets of springs, depending on whether you are looking for comfort or performance. For greater comfort, you will need a lower weight rating. If you are looking for performance, take a higher weight rating. You will receive a shock wrench and instructions, allowing you to easily replace the shock absorbers.The springs have a guaranteed lifespan of more than one million cycles. And they will keep 100% of their effectiveness in relation to the quality dampers traditional running shoes that degrade rapidly.


STUDS
ENKO your pair will be delivered with a key and 6 replacement studs.
The studs are interchangeable, giving your Enko shoes better durability than traditional running shoes.
Then you will be able to order the studs on our website www.enko-running-shoes.com.



              Do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions!



    The weight of a running-shoe ENKO 8.5 shoe size is 380 grams


The patented sole adapts to any type of stride: neutral pronation or supination.
With one click you can switch from walking to running position:
ON position allows you to use the Enko to your daily activities. Its high-tech design will turn the heads of everyone.
In the on position, the Enko turns into a running shoe with exceptional performance.
This running shoe is designed for use on roads, trails, paths, etc., but it is not suitable for practicing trail running.
We wanted an undisputed quality shoe, so we made them in Italy, an international reference for quality shoes, by the king of Rudiano.
Why such a price?


The ENKO running shoe is a high-tech product and is made with
the latest materials from the aerospace industry.
This is a Franco-Italian production: we build the
sole and assembly in our workshops in France while the shoes themselves are
made in Italy. These are custom shoes, made to order.
ENKO is truly amazing, it stores and returns
energy like no other shoe can do today.
It is unique in the world: the only shoe to adapt
to the weight of the runner.
The goal of Enko is to protect the health of
runners: the shoes have been designed to prevent injury.

We are so confident in our Enko running shoes that we have extended the guarantee of a 30 day warranty to a full ONE YEAR! This means that if all the parts are broken due to human error during your first year of ownership, we will gladly send you the brand new parts at no cost to you!

Why we need your help





The project that we present is a real breakthrough in innovation, an adventure to evolve the technology. No big brand running shoe would have dared to take the risk of such an innovation.
The goal of our approach is not to make a financial transaction. We are passionate and want to share this extraordinary evolution in running shoes with the greatest number of people.
The principle of crowdfunding is to support innovative projects, we rely on you to help this new technology exist and continue to develop.
All the advantages described with respect to the shoe are real.






The story Enko

Christian FRESCHI, designer and developer of Running Shoes Enko, is above all an avid runner who always run both competitively and for fun.
He spent 12 years developing this running shoe, and over the years has paid his genius in the making and testing dozens of prototypes, resulting today in a running shoe that is perfect and is protected by international patents.
The shoe adjusts to the weight of the rider, his running style, and is pronator or supinator.
With its double sole and design to avoid injury, it offers total comfort.
What we have done



                     We tested many prototypes




                            The unique design




                 
Technical specifications


                                      
                                      Study and Design Notes 

This shoe utilises mechanical parts integrated into the sole,
which provide it with significant cushioning (increased comfort) and energy
release (increased performance).
The innovative sole is equipped with two shock-absorbers,
permitting a gentle release, at the right moment, of all the energy stored
during cushioning of the stride........... . Learn more  :  Technical study  (PDF) .

How do I select more than one pair of shoes?
The Indiegogo system is not configured to select several pairs. If you want to choose more than one pair, you will need to launch a separate process for each pre-order.
I pre-ordered Enko Running Shoes, but I do not receive a confirmation email. How can I check the status of my order?

2.How can I make a claim?

3.Does the insurance provided by the campaign? Is it legitimate insurance?
ENKO the country participating in a pilot test with Indiegogo. Insurance is provided by Indiegogo and not the campaign.

to the Lighthill™ Wallet which is thinner, lighter and more flexible

This way, you get the best of both worlds - minimally thin yet massively convenient.

<p>With the special design of the anti-degaussing module, the wallet can keep 2 magnetic stripe cards. To make sure any cards with the magnetic stripe are securely protected, only 2 points have to note:</p>
<p>1, Keep the magnetic-field-shielding metal plates face to face;</p>
<p>2, Store any of your cards with a magnetic stripe in the anti-degaussing module.</p>

Carbon fiber is light and tough and great to look at. That`s why our team fell in love with it and started to make things with carbon fiber. To make the PITAKA New Wallet sleek as well as strong, we enhance it using our Aramidcore technology.

 

With the special design of the anti-degaussing module, the wallet can keep 2 magnetic stripe cards. To make sure any cards with the magnetic stripe are securely protected, only 2 points have to note:
1, Keep the magnetic-field-shielding metal plates face to face;
2, Store any of your cards with a magnetic stripe in the anti-degaussing module.
The following video shows more details.

 

The following video shows how we tested the magnetic stripe cards with the Anti-Degaussing module:

<p><strong>My name is Elliot Gatt. I'm a type 1 diabetic, and the Founder of Good Glucos, the world's first glucometer company with a giving model.</strong> Knowing first hand the struggle of paying for diabetes supplies, our mission is to make test strips accessible to everyone! </p>
<p>We sell affordable ($35/100) premium quality test strips on a subscription basis. For every 12 new subscribers we give away a 12 month subscription to someone in need. Your subscription is a gift of a month of essential blood glucose monitoring!</p>
<p>Since launching in January, <strong>we have given away 27,000 test strips! We’ve helped diabetics around the world, from Canada, USA, Morocco, Gambia, and most recently with Beyond Type 1 in Peru.</strong> </p>
<p>Type 1 Diabetes means constant blood glucose monitoring, up to 10 times per day, and the financial burden of medical supplies is endless. We want to help fill the need in this space, so we’ve designed a clothing line to help. </p>
<p>The concept is simple: <strong>1 Shirt = 50 Test Strips.</strong> For every T-Shirt we sell we will give away 50 diabetic test strips to someone in need. Each sweatshirt will provide 50 test strips AND a glucometer to someone in need. Strips and accompanying glucometers will be given away in 12-month supplies to each individual.</p>
<p>Equipped with the right tools to test blood glucose levels, individuals are better able to manage their diabetes and avoid severe health complications. Help someone with their complex diabetes management, with something as simple as a T-shirt purchase. </p>
<p>Look good, feel good, and do good.</p>

<p>Your contribution to this campaign will change lives. On our latest trip to Peru, we were able to help people like Lidia &amp; Victoria. Lidia is 57 years old, and her blood sugar level were in the high 300s (dangerously high). Victoria’s blood glucose was 585. Living with out-of-control, high blood sugars has incredibly detrimental long-term health consequences and impact quality of life both short and long term. The ability to measure their blood glucose levels, allows Lidia and Victoria to take steps to reduce their level, gain some control over diabetes, and avoid future complications.</p>

Type 1 Diabetes means constant blood glucose monitoring, up to 10 times per day, and the financial burden of medical supplies is endless. We want to help fill the need in this space, so we’ve designed a clothing line to help. 
The concept is simple: 1 Shirt = 50 Test Strips. For every T-Shirt we sell we will give away 50 diabetic test strips to someone in need. Each sweatshirt will provide 50 test strips AND a glucometer to someone in need. Strips and accompanying glucometers will be given away in 12-month supplies to each individual.
Equipped with the right tools to test blood glucose levels, individuals are better able to manage their diabetes and avoid severe health complications. Help someone with their complex diabetes management, with something as simple as a T-shirt purchase. 
Look good, feel good, and do good.

 


 




 


Our funding goal of $25,000 will enable us to give away over 41,000 test strips to those who need it most. We give 12 month subscriptions (100 test strips/month) by:

First, giving to those who need it most - individuals from around the world who apply for urgent help through our always giving tab 
Secondly, we will begin building our support for our 2018 Giving Trip to Peru 
Help us surpass our goal, and we provide test strips through our giving partner Margorie’s Fund, and Beyond Type 1’s Access Fund. 


 
Your contribution to this campaign will change lives. On our latest trip to Peru, we were able to help people like Lidia & Victoria. Lidia is 57 years old, and her blood sugar level were in the high 300s (dangerously high). Victoria’s blood glucose was 585. Living with out-of-control, high blood sugars has incredibly detrimental long-term health consequences and impact quality of life both short and long term. The ability to measure their blood glucose levels, allows Lidia and Victoria to take steps to reduce their level, gain some control over diabetes, and avoid future complications.
 

 



 


There are so many ways you can help us make a difference in this space:
    •    Know someone who is living with diabetes and isn’t able to afford test strips? Help them sign up to be a recipient: https://goodglucos.com/always-giving/ 
    •    Make some noise about this campaign, with Indiegogo’s share tools!
    •    Tell your family and friends about our Good Glucos Gives Campaign via text
    •    Tell the world on snapchat!:)
Thanks for reading our story, and helping us to make a real positive impact in the lives of those living with diabetes around the world. 
Remember, Good Glucos T-shirts look good, feel good, and do good!",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Most of the furniture you buy these days is deliberately designed to fall apart.

<p>probably your furniture. Shelving is usually made from pressed wood like plywood, MDF, particleboard, or fibreboard.

SAME SAME ...
Is there a reason why shelving has to be boring and static?Is there a reason why designer shelving should not be affordable?Is there a reason why everyone's house or office should look the same?We don't think so!
BADLY-MADE RUBBISH
Most of the furniture you buy these days is deliberately designed to fall apart. Depending on its quality, some furniture does stick around for a while, but a large amount of it is built cheaply to be landfilled after just a couple of years of use. The industry wants you to buy more new stuff. Bad for the environment and bad for your wallet!
THE MOST TOXIC THING IN YOUR HOUSE IS …
probably your furniture. Shelving is usually made from pressed wood like plywood, MDF, particleboard, or fibreboard. What you probably don't know, is that pressed wood contains high levels of formaldehyde; a highly toxic substance which evaporates over years and causes cancer.  For more info visit The National Cancer Institute and the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA.
TOXIC RUBBISH?  WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT! THE BAD NEWS END HERE AND THE GOOD NEWS START WITH 'BUILD'.",53.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<div class="""">Hi I’m Lila Morency. I was born in Quebec, Canada and lived there until I was 8 when my family relocated to Boulder, Colorado. After 10 years in this beautiful city I moved to Milan. I've now been living in Italy for the past 6 and a half years and I’ve been on the path of becoming a fashion designer. Ever since I organized a small fashion show during my last year of high school, I knew that fashion was going to be in my future. Quickly after high school graduation, I decided to go live in Italy for my sabbatical year in order to more clearly understand what being a fashion designer really meant. I became an apprentice for a designer who had a small company where they produced garments for well-known fashion brand names. There, I got my first taste of this fascinating world. After a year, I was guided to a great fashion institute in Milan where I decided to continue my studies. </div>
<p>After three incredible and challenging years at the Marangoni Institute, I graduated and was right away offered a job for a casual sports fashion firm. I’ve been working there for almost three years. Take part in all aspects of creating, product researching, and producing the collections.</p>
<p>This past Fall, I decided I was ready to take the leap and start designing my own collection. Last February I had my first fashion show in Florence. What a great experience! It was only intended to be a presentation, a coming out event. Therefore no clothes were sold afterwards.</p>
<p>For this next collection, I’m taking another leap. I’m launching myself into the world of high end fashion, organizing a show during the Milan Fashion week in September 2013. This means that, on top of drawing the clothes, I am now assembling the right team to work with me. This includes pattern makers, fabric factories, specialized seamstresses, and knitwear factories. I am also selecting the runway models, the location, photographers, makeup and hair artists, video makers, caterers, and the general crew for the preparation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div class="""">
<p>During fashion week everything costs more. For the show itself (the location, crew, models, photographers, caterers, video makers, and hair and makeup artists) I will need around €30k. On top of this I evaluate that the production of the garments that will be shown on the runway will cost about €20k. I need your help to get lots of publicity in order for the right people such as buyers and fashion journalists to come to the show. So the first thing you can do to be part of this experience is spread the word. Tell all of your friends, family and anyone you know who might have an interest in my project.</p>
<p>I also need your help with the financial part of this venture. Anything helps! I am offering perks for small and large donations from sneak peeks of outfits to garments and the ultimate prize: an invitation to the fashion show for 2. Your chance to mingle with the elite fashion world of Milan!</p>
</div>
<div class="""">I will post regular updates to let you know how the collection is evolving.</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I would like to have a long term impact. Since fashion is present in everyone's lives (we must all get dressed everyday), I hope to be able to inform people about the benefits of using certain fabrics versus others, of wearing garments that have been dyed with natural substances such as fruit and vegetables, instead of chemicals that produce toxic waste and require higher energy consumption. I will do my best to research and find the highest quality and most eco-friendly materials. We, as humans, are starting to pay more attention to how we treat our planet, and I want my work in fashion to contribute to that effort.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>No worries if you can't contribute financially! I thank you in advance just for the time you took to view my campaign and I hope to have ignited a spark in you to pass the message on to others because it is much easier to have an impact on the world if we all work together. I hope to get many of you involved and excited about this fascinating world of fashion!</p>

<p>Quello che hai appena visto era un flash sulla mia prima sfilata che è stata a febbraio. E’ stato un’esperienza emozionante, però il prossimo step è di lanciarmi nel mondo dell’alta moda durante la settimana della moda Milanese a settembre. E ho solo due minuti per trasmetterti il mio entusiasmo per il progetto! Ah già, io sono Lila Morency, come sicuramente avrai indovinato. Sono Canadese Francese, Americana, e praticamente Italiana anche e ho intensione di portare la mia visione globale alla prossima settimana della moda.</p>
<p> Io vorrei creare delle aspettative molto alte per I giovani stilisti in Italia visto che ce ne sono molto pocchi. Io non solo vorrei avere un impatto nel mondo, ma voglio dare a più persone la possibilità di contribuire e far parte di questa nuova avventura creativa. Quindi adesso ti dirò quello che farò nei prossimi mesi:</p>
<p>Durante questa fase iniziale del progetto, sto disegnando la collezione e cercando il team giusto con il quale lavorare. Questi includono:</p>
<p>modellisti, fornitori di tessuti, confezionisti e sarte specializzate, maglifici, e uno showroom per le vendite dopo.</p>
<p>Ho preventivato che mi costerà attorno ai 20 mila euro.</p>
<p>Per quanto riguarda la mia sfilata, gestirò:</p>
<p>La selezione delle modelle da passerella, la location, i fotografi, truccatori e parruchieri, una persona per le riprese video della sfilata e backstage, il catering, un dj/fonico, vestieriste, il team per la preparazione</p>
<p>Visto che tutto durante la settimana della moda costa il doppio, questa parte mi costerà attorno ai 30 mila euro. Lo so…sono tanti soldi…ed è per questo che io ti sto chiedendo di contribuire. Le persone che mi conoscono bene ti diranno che ho il vizio di sognare in grande e che lavoro con molto impegno per realizzare i miei obbietivi. Questo è il mio sogno più grande in questa fase della mia vita ma è anche il prossimo passo che devo compiere per far crescere la mia cariera. Questo è il momento giusto e ce la devo fare!...ne farai parte?</p>
<p>Se farai parte di questo progetto, potrai seguirmi passo per passo nella creazione di un nuovo brand di moda. Significa far parte di una squadra che crede nella magia di prendere elementi della natura e di creare bellissimi capi di abbigliamento, aiutando l’ecosistema perché userò fibre e tinture naturali. Ti ringrazio in anticipo per il tuo contributo e spero che, insieme, possiamo non solo raggiungere ma anche superare la somma che ho specificato qui. Conto su di te per aiutarmi ad avere sucesso nel mondo della moda, una sfilata alla volta.</p>

<div>Et ce n'est que pour la production des vêtements! J'estime à 20000 euros le coût pour les réaliser.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Pour la présentation de Milan, je dois m'occuper:</div>
<div>De la sélection des mannequins, de trouver un endroit, des photographes, des coiffeurs et maquilleurs, de la production d'une vidéo, des traiteurs, du DJ et équipement sonore, de l'équipe de montage</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Et parce que tous les prix sont le double pendant la semaine de la mode, cette partie coûtera environ 30000 euros. Je sais.... c'est beaucoup d'argent...

<p><u><strong>Who am I &amp; what do I know about making socks?</strong></u></p>
<p>My name is Jeffrey and I've been in the sock game for years - providing manufacturing support and designs for some of the biggest fashion brands in the world. I am very proud of all the work I’ve done with these companies but I always believed we could take quality and design to the next level - while keeping the price extremely affordable. So now it is time to fill in the gaps, go out on my own, and provide the most comfortable fashion sock a consumer could desire, while creating designs that will make you proud to roll up your pants!</p>

<p><u><strong>Why are we on Indiegogo?</strong></u></p>
<p>Heshí initial goal is to raise <u>$25,000</u>. Our initial purchase order for all styles and colors displayed has been placed and will be available to the general public whether we reach this total or fall slightly short. However, early adopters deserve a lot for their initial trust in a product. Depending on your contribution, <strong>you will enjoy anywhere from 3 pairs of HESHÍ socks to SOCKS FOR LIFE, at a greatly reduced price.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>When will I get my socks?</strong></u></p>
<p>Heshí socks are coming to a website near you (<a href=""http://www.heshiwear.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.heshiwear.com</a>). Our product is scheduled to arrive in our warehouse around March 1<sup>st</sup> , 2017 for direct shipment to our supporters. Our excitement to spread the word and share our product with early adopters is essential to the early success of our company. Your contribution will be a tremendous support to our company. It will allow us to take this revenue and further spread the word. We can ensure future seasons of Heshí socks while bringing a smile to your face and comfort to your feet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Will they shrink?</strong></u></p>
<p>Yes. They will shrink slightly after the first wash and the size chart has taken this into account. After that, enjoy the construction and comfort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Giving Back:</strong></u></p>
<p>Heshí has a vision of giving back to our world. We also understand socks are the #1 most requested clothing item in homeless shelters. With that knowledge, every contribution<strong> will allow Heshí to donate a pair of boot socks to a charity who needs our help.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>In Conclusion:</strong></u></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to review our socks. I hope we are what you are looking for, even if you didn’t realize you needed it. Your support means everything – whether it is a financial contribution through this website – or spreading the word to your friends and family through social media.  </p>

What is Heshí?
Pronounced Heh-She...

The name Heshí is in honor of my grandfather Harry. It was his nickname and I can only hope to bring as much love and happiness to the world as he brought to me.
In Chinese, the word Heshí means: ""suitable"" or ""to have a good fit."" Not a bad coincidence for a fashion brand.
We don't make socks specifically for men or women, all of our styles are for He's and She's.

So at our core, we are an all-inclusive company looking to bring love and comfort to all!

Who am I & what do I know about making socks?
My name is Jeffrey and I've been in the sock game for years - providing manufacturing support and designs for some of the biggest fashion brands in the world. I am very proud of all the work I’ve done with these companies but I always believed we could take quality and design to the next level - while keeping the price extremely affordable. So now it is time to fill in the gaps, go out on my own, and provide the most comfortable fashion sock a consumer could desire, while creating designs that will make you proud to roll up your pants!

Yes. They will shrink slightly after the first wash and the size chart has taken this into account. After that, enjoy the construction and comfort.
 
Giving Back:
Heshí has a vision of giving back to our world. We also understand socks are the #1 most requested clothing item in homeless shelters. With that knowledge, every contribution will allow Heshí to donate a pair of boot socks to a charity who needs our help.
 
In Conclusion:
Thank you for taking the time to review our socks. I hope we are what you are looking for, even if you didn’t realize you needed it. Your support means everything – whether it is a financial contribution through this website – or spreading the word to your friends and family through social media.

<h2>UPDATE: Hey everyone I am just waiting for the payment to clear and I will ship out your watches. Thanks for the contributions.</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><u>Summary</u></h2>
<p>Firstly you will not be waiting for purchase orders or prototyping or any of that other stuff that generally comes along with crowdfunding. These watches are ready to be shipped the minute the campaign concludes. I guarantee you will not find a watch this nice for a lower price so pledge with confidence.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2><u>What You Get</u></h2>
<p>Your watch will be shipped as soon as the campaign ends along with a multi-tool that will allow you to remove links from the steel band so you can size it to your wrist from your home. The tool can also be used to replace the band altogether with something you find more appealing (maybe leather...maybe a NATO...maybe milanese...who knows - whatever you like.) Furthermore, by having this tool you can interchange bands as much as you like, creating different styles for different occasions or for any other reason.</p>

<p><strong>So many watches ready to be shipped!</strong></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><u>The Long Story</u></h2>
<h3>Not important unless you're curious (previous campaign attempt)</h3>
<p>So basically my partner and I had an idea to create customizable titanium dials using a CO2 laser and anodization. We thought it was pretty unique because most custom dials were cheaply printed using paper or plastic. By using recycled titanium the faces had a shine to them and the process was quick and cheap enough to be affordable on a larger scale.  People could choose between designing their own watch or choosing from a variety of pre-made designs. Our first campaign almost got us to an ambitious goal - the minimum purchase order of the watches and some equipment - but ultimately fell short. As the campaign came to an end people started to withdraw when they realized we were not going to meet our goal, but we felt there was a good enough response to try again. With this in mind we decided to take out a loan and purchased the watches ahead of time. We believed that with a lower goal we could be successful and then make up the difference by selling watches afterwards. Having watches on hand also allowed us to demonstrate the concept in more detail by showing a number of examples of what could be done. This campaign went more poorly than the first. Perhaps it was some changes we made to the design process, perhaps it was the time of year, perhaps the concept just wasn't as cool as we thought it was, but all we know is that we didn't make it for a second time. At this point our hopes were deflated and we decided to move on with other aspects of life like work and school. Knowing what we know now we would do a lot of things differently, but it was a great learning experience and a fun experiment. The brand name we came up with was ""oblako"" and is laser embossed on both the case back and clasp. These are a limited edition in the lamest sense because they will never be produced again and it has a bit of a fun story to it.  We now want to offload as much of the remaining inventory as we can to recoup some of our costs. We took a long time finding a watch we were happy with and stand by the exceptional quality (especially at this price point). We are confident in saying that you could not find another watch as nice as this one for less money.</p>

Summary
Firstly you will not be waiting for purchase orders or prototyping or any of that other stuff that generally comes along with crowdfunding. These watches are ready to be shipped the minute the campaign concludes. I guarantee you will not find a watch this nice for a lower price so pledge with confidence.
 

What You Get
Your watch will be shipped as soon as the campaign ends along with a multi-tool that will allow you to remove links from the steel band so you can size it to your wrist from your home. The tool can also be used to replace the band altogether with something you find more appealing (maybe leather...maybe a NATO...maybe milanese...who knows - whatever you like.) Furthermore, by having this tool you can interchange bands as much as you like, creating different styles for different occasions or for any other reason.

Super Simple - Ready to Ship, No Headaches & A Great Deal!
$40 CAD (Approx. $30 USD) or $70 CAD (Approx. $52 USD) for 2
Ships in time for the holiday season - makes a great, affordable gift!
All watches that will be shipped are in brand new condition straight from the factory.
Below is the producer I originally ordered from. You can see that their watches are quite a bit pricer than what I am asking. It's a discontinued model.

My watch with a NATO strap! The band width is 22mm. There are tons of reasonably priced options on ebay (this is where I got mine) to achieve your desired look using the multi-tool.

Slim case provides a sleek look. Sapphire crystal for a scratch proof window with no glare.


Dial and movement removed from a case. Matte black dial with raised chrome indicators. Also has luminescent hands and indicators at each hour.


So many watches ready to be shipped!
 
The Long Story
Not important unless you're curious (previous campaign attempt)
So basically my partner and I had an idea to create customizable titanium dials using a CO2 laser and anodization. We thought it was pretty unique because most custom dials were cheaply printed using paper or plastic. By using recycled titanium the faces had a shine to them and the process was quick and cheap enough to be affordable on a larger scale.  People could choose between designing their own watch or choosing from a variety of pre-made designs. Our first campaign almost got us to an ambitious goal - the minimum purchase order of the watches and some equipment - but ultimately fell short. As the campaign came to an end people started to withdraw when they realized we were not going to meet our goal, but we felt there was a good enough response to try again. With this in mind we decided to take out a loan and purchased the watches ahead of time. We believed that with a lower goal we could be successful and then make up the difference by selling watches afterwards. Having watches on hand also allowed us to demonstrate the concept in more detail by showing a number of examples of what could be done. This campaign went more poorly than the first. Perhaps it was some changes we made to the design process, perhaps it was the time of year, perhaps the concept just wasn't as cool as we thought it was, but all we know is that we didn't make it for a second time. At this point our hopes were deflated and we decided to move on with other aspects of life like work and school. Knowing what we know now we would do a lot of things differently, but it was a great learning experience and a fun experiment. The brand name we came up with was ""oblako"" and is laser embossed on both the case back and clasp. These are a limited edition in the lamest sense because they will never be produced again and it has a bit of a fun story to it.  We now want to offload as much of the remaining inventory as we can to recoup some of our costs. We took a long time finding a watch we were happy with and stand by the exceptional quality (especially at this price point). We are confident in saying that you could not find another watch as nice as this one for less money.

Nobody knows that the lamps produced in the USSR are the most reliable, have the thickest glass and are very resistant to vibrations, because they were developed for use in the military industry. We broke a lot of indicator lamps from different manufacturers, such as the USA, Germany or Japan, and we can say for sure that you will make the right choice by choosing a clock on Soviet-made lamps. We use only new lamps, from old military warehouses.Products are very technological inside, the printed circuit boards of the clocks have been designed to provide all the reliability requirements. More than 10 different prototypes of watches were assembled and tested before we came to what you see. Each lamp is selected individually, based on the emmission parameters and diameter of the glass bulb.Nixoid  Nixoid use IN-16 nixie tubes to display the time. Specifically for the Nixoid clock we develop an algorithm for synchronous ignition of lamps and anti-poisoning of cathodes, so the resource of the IN-16 indicators increased several times and the viewing of the time became more beatiful.  Nixoid high voltage generation system has a power reserve of 3.57 times, it is very reliable. Specifically for the Nixoid we develop dynamic backlight charging battery level. When the battery is 100% charged, tubes has backlight like nuclear color, during use backlight slowly stay a green color.Nixoid specs:
Time format: 12/24 hour;
Date format: DD/MM/YY;
Battery: built-in rechargeable lithium-polymer, nonremovable, 220mAh;
Power supply: 5V DC;
Connection: micro-USB;
Operating temperature; 0 to +50c / 32 to 122F;
Dimensions: diameter is 55mm, height is 20mm;
Strap: 22mm, fully compatible with Gear S3 straps or any 22mm straps.
 You can charge wristwatch via any computer or notebook with USB port. Special charging system keep battery stronger for a long time. During charging, you can turn on the time display mode by simply pressing the button. Nixod autonomity is perfect! From one charge the watch works more than 20 days of normal use and more than 2 months in standby mode. And even if the battery is discharged to 0%, you do not need to adjust the time again, only charge it!Watch case made from ABS plastic. It does not rust and not amenable to acids. The case is strong and elastic. Each case is handled entirely by hand, passing all the stages - sanding, priming, painting. Every wristwatch is unique.Wristwatch is desighned for everyday wear, so it are light, compact and work for a long time.GlowerGlower use IV-9 numitron tubes to display the time. Small filaments are glow in NOS gas. It is look very futuristic. It is a new thing in tube wristwatches era. This watch small and very light. Glower watches use narrowly specialized microcircuits for controlling the filaments in the numitron IV-9 tubes, which made it possible to simplify the clock circuit and reduce the current consumption. We add battery percentage in menu, only long press a button and you can see the information about battery.Glower specs:
Time format: 12/24 hour;  
Date format: DD/MM/YY;  
Battery: built-in rechargeable lithium-polymer, nonremovable, 200mAh;  
Power supply: 5V DC;  
Connection: micro-USB;
Operating temperature; 0 to +50c / 32 to 122F;  
Dimensions: diameter is 49mm, height is 18mm;  
Strap: 22mm, fully compatible with Gear S3 straps or any 22mm straps.
During charging, Glower visualise cool effect on a tubes. You can turn on the time display mode by simply pressing the button. Full time of battery charging is above 50 minutes. From one charge the watch works more than 14 days of normal use and more than 2 months in standby mode. ERA VFDERA use IV-3A VFD (vacuum fluorescent display) tubes. Each tube has a phosphor coated anode that is bombarded by electrons emmited from the cathode filament. VFD tubes emits a very bright light with high contrast. We thought about making a wristwatch with this tubes for a long time and we did it. It was very difficult to make a small-sized scheme that can operate with such tubes effectively. They are unique, there are no analogues in the worls, we were the first to present a wrist watch with VFD tubes. ERA has a complex, but very accurate hight voltage generation system. Specifially for the ERA we add a battery percentage in menu and beatiful segment animation. ERA specs:
Time format: 12/24 hour;  
Date format: DD/MM/YY;  
Battery: built-in rechargeable lithium-polymer, nonremovable, 300mAh;  
Power supply: 5V DC;

Dimensions: width is 57mm, lenght is 42mm, height is 18mm;
Strap: 22mm, fully compatible with Gear S3 straps or any 22mm straps.
In the process of charging you can turn in the clock and see the percentage of charge in menu.When charging is complere, the LEDs will turn off.  Full time of battery charging is above 80 minutes.From one charge the watch works more than 15 days of normal use and more than 2 mounts in standby mode.Lamps have a very large and contrast segments.Video preview of wristwatchesWatch customizationEven such a stylish and unusual gadget, like a clock itself looks less impressive than with the bracelet or strap.

<p><b>StoP
on a Penny</b></p>
<p><b>Goal:
</b>Raise $2500 to
ride the STP bicycle classic on a Penny Farthing. </p>
<p><b>What
is the STP?</b></p>
<p>The Seattle to Portland Bicycle
Classic, or STP, is an annual bicycle ride from Seattle, Washington to
Portland, Oregon. The STP is one of the
10 biggest recreational bicycle rides in the country it is approximately 202
miles in length. Approximately the distance from New York to Boston or London
to Paris.</p>
<p><b>What
is a Penny Farthing?</b></p>
<p>The penny-farthing is a type of
bicycle with a large front wheel and a much smaller rear wheel. It was popular
in the 1880s. The name comes from the British penny and farthing coins, one
much larger than the other, so that the side view resembles a penny leading a
farthing. An important
and unfortunate attribute of the penny-farthing is that the rider sits high and
nearly over the front axle. When the wheel strikes rocks and ruts, or under
hard braking, the rider can be pitched forward off the bicycle head-first,
called ""taking a header"" or simply ""a header"". Headers were,
and still are, relatively common and a significant, sometimes fatal, hazard.</p>
<p><b>Why
do I want to do the StoP?</b></p>
<p>I want to ride the StoP because it
is a classic ride! Like the Markleeville Death Ride (but without the 15,000 feet
of climbing) it is a measure of your abilities as an athlete and has serious
bragging rights. It is a true test of what I can accomplish with focus and
determination. </p>
<p>Additionally<span>  I am looking for a challenge and this would
be a challenge! Something to excite me to push myself to do things I didn’t
know could be done let alone by me. I have competed in Ironman Triathlons and
the Boston Marathon and while these are great events I prefer to do something a
little more obscure. Recent challenges have been to ride a unicycle up Mt
Diablo and learning to play the bagpipes. Next year I hope to combine the two!</span></p>
<p>A 200 mile bike ride is a challenge
for any one. To do it on a Penny Farthing is as exciting as it is ridiculous,
but that is what makes it fun. Often, our lives becomes too routine, like Taco
Tuesday and running on Wednesday. The goals we set are predictable and failure
is rarely disastrous. With family and kids, it’s easy to set our sights on
getting through the week or semester and we lose some of the adventure of
living. Doing something crazy reminds me that I’m still alive and kicking
(peddling). </p>
<p><b>Do
I think I could make it?</b></p>
<p>I have been an endurance athlete
for a long time. I was always the slow kid, I’d finish but not too quickly. As
I got older and the distances got farther speed didn’t matter as much it was if
you could finish. I can finish. </p>
<p>I swam from Alcatraz to San
Francisco, across Lake Tahoe, run 25 marathons (including 3 Bostons Marathons),
four Ironman Triathlons, rode a mountain bike from San Francisco to Los Angeles
and across Ireland.<span>  </span></p>
<p>I know if I put in the time to
train I WILL finish.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Why don’t I buy my own bike??</b></p>
<p>A new bike just isn’t in the budget.
Aside from hula lessons, tae-kwon-do, school play, bagpipe lessons and a new
heater (surprise), we just don’t have the extra money to get a new penny
farthing.  Doing a crowd funding campaign is a way to raise money and
create a community of supporters that can be part of a great adventure. I have been told I would be more successful if
I was raising money for a charity. I did approach several charities and asked
if I could raise money for them but I thought it was disingenuous to nominally
support a worthy cause. Instead I prefer to do this ride as a fun raiser – no
D. Where the point is to have fun and to get people to smile at the absurdity
of a guy on penny farthing rather than make than feel like they should do more
for someone in need.</p>
<p><b>Why can’t I ride Emma Dodd, it looks
like a perfectly good bike?</b></p>
<p>My current penny farthing, Emma Dodd,
is a great bike but she was built for show not for serious biking. I recently
wore out a set of forks just riding around town. I will break a spoke on almost
every ride and have had problems with the solid rubber tires. I’m
afraid that if I push her on a long ride the wheel, with me on top, will
crumple. I am hoping to replace Emma with a bike that is built for riding:
larger wheel 52” vs 48” diameter, better geometry and most important springs on
the seat to help decrease RBFS (Rider Butt Fatigue Syndrome which currently
limits rides to 45 minutes) Basically I
need a penny farthing that can withstand the stress of a 200 mile ride.</p>
<p><b>Why should you contribute to Stop on a Penny?</b></p>
<p>Have you ever shared watched a survival
show where you think the premise is ridiculous but morbid curiosity keeps you
watching? Seriously, naked in the jungle? Will they really eat that? No Bear
Grylls, elephant poop is not a good source of protein! </p>
<p>This ride is like that, AND you can be
part of it! As a contributor you have the ultimate bragging rights. “Not only
is that guy nuts but I’m funding his project”. You can follow my training, by
watching video updates, ride with me if you are in the area and possibly even
take a ride on Emma Dodd,(my current penny farthing) I can answer questions and
let you know what it’s really like to ride that far on a bike from the 1880s. </p>
<p>As a thank you gift for contributing
and to make you feel part of the greatest Penny Farthing adventure since Thomas
Stevens rode around the world in 1884, you will receive a sticker with the StoP
on a Penny logo for a $10 donation, an awesome t-shirt with the StoP Logo for a
$25 donation, and for a $50 donation I will give you a riding lesson on Emma
Dodd if you are in the San Francisco, East Bay Area.</p>

<p>This is the next generation of travel wear. Gone are the days of stains, wrinkles, soggy clothes, and bulky travel bags. </p>
<p>Adventure Wear will be the one nice shirt you need on your trip. Stains come out, it won’t wrinkle, and it dries quickly, leaving you cool and ready for the day or night. </p>

<p><br/><strong>Where I got the Idea:</strong></p>
<p>While staying in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I made friends with several Italian immigrants who, like me, were trying to eke out a living and extend their stay. Some of their friends from Italy came to visit during the Sao Vito festival, which is basically a two month party celebrating all things Italian.</p>
<p>Of course, we had to take them out to celebrate. Unfortunately, they would only be there from Monday until Thursday. Keep in mind, I was traveling, so I only had one nice shirt. I just had to wash it a lot. We were out all night in typical Brazilian style, drinking wine until the sun rose the next day.</p>
<p>It was about this time I looked down to realize my clothes were completely ruined. We had left from work, and this left no time to change. Now it was time to go to work again, and my clothes were covered in grease, wine, and mud. No way I could go in looking like that. I panicked for about an hour, tried to clean my shirt off, but only made it wet in addition to dirty. Finally I called a friend and borrowed a shirt from him.</p>
<p>The next morning I was late, and in trouble. That made me think: What if I had a shirt that could match the flexible and unpredictable life of a traveler?</p>
<p><img alt=""Picture"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.weebly.com/uploads/7/1/0/2/7102066/2670553_orig.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/><strong>The Solution</strong><br/><br/>I realized that travelers needed something to lighten their load. Something versatile and resilient that could go on as many trips as they did. A shirt that they could wear to work, to the bar, to the Tomatina, whatever, then just wash it off and wear it again the next day.<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Tomatina_2006.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Pictured: Adventure                                                              Via <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Tomatina_2006.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia</a><br/><br/><br/><img alt=""Picture"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.weebly.com/uploads/7/1/0/2/7102066/5566156.jpg?251"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>What is it?</strong><br/><br/>Adventure Wear has been in the making for almost a year now. In that time I have worked with several different designers in an attempt to find the perfect fabric: a blend of natural and synthetic fibers to maximize comfort,  dry speed, style, and durability. I also researched many different nano washes to find the maximum stain release and resistant formulas. <br/><br/>Once I brought the fabric and the stain-release formula together, I began testing prototypes to find the perfect blend of fabric and concentration of stain-release to make the best shirt for travelers. <br/><br/>The tests I did include both in-house, controlled tests with specific substances and real life tests. I also gave the shirts to friends who I knew would be doing traveling or other adventurous things so they could give me independent feedback as to how Adventure Wear works in real life. You can see the data table from the tests and their testimonies below.<br/><br/>The fabric is a blend of cotton and polyester and is rated wrinkle proof and has the quick dry certification. <br/><br/>The shirts are made in humane conditions by workers paid a fair wage in Taiwan, and then imported to the US.</p>
<p><img alt=""Picture"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.weebly.com/uploads/7/1/0/2/7102066/658718.png?573"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><strong>Our Goal</strong><br/><br/>Our goal at Adventure Wear is to make life easier for travelers and professionals everywhere. Why worry about your nice clothes when you can just ball them up and throw them in your suitcase? Why let grease stains make you change your whole wardrobe? <br/><br/>The shirts are made from a blend of polyester and cotton, which gives them a combination of breathability, durability, and comfort. Applied to the fabric is a stain-release treatment that we have tested both at the office and in real world trials to determine how durable the shirts are. See the chart above for exact data. <br/><br/>The design is intended to look good in and out of the office, and keep you comfortable and dry while traveling.<br/><br/><img alt=""Picture"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.weebly.com/uploads/7/1/0/2/7102066/3374425_orig.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>                                                                Photo by Greg Bull Photography<br/><br/><strong>Your Contribution</strong><br/><br/>With the support of Indiegogo and people like you, we will be able to start manufacturing Adventure Wear full time.

<p>""My name is Mike Sotak, and I have had such a good experience with the Adventure Wear prototype that I felt the need to write about the product in detail. As an aerospace engineer in an office environment, wearing a nice shirt and slacks is a staple of the job. However, as a fellow adventurer who finds himself traveling constantly, wandering the city streets all hours of the night, I also need clothing that can keep up with my lifestyle. Similar to the Sao Paulo story, I have found myself transitioning from a night out on the town to an extended conference where I have to look presentable. This is where Adventure Wear truly meets my needs. <br/><br/>Let me relate a personal experience using the first prototype. Several months ago I was called on a last minute business trip to Pasadena, California, only several days after returning from a week long trip in Colorado Springs. I had no clean clothes, and I was to be attending two full days worth of meetings at JPL. Seeing this as a good opportunity to test the prototype, I asked the Adventure Wear team to use the shirt on my trip. Not only did the shirt keep me looking fresh for the conference, but it managed to handle the sweltering California sun as I roamed the streets each night in search of glory: fish tacos, sushi boats, and mojitos. After the conference was over, my physical appearance in Adventure Wear managed to conceal my exhausted mental framework. I look forward to the day when the team can roll out the full Adventure Wear line!""</p>

<p> </p></div>","Why Buy Adventure Wear?The many benefits include: 


Breathability: As seen in video, stains pass through and roll off of the shirt but won’t stick to it. The fabric will keep you cool and looking your best.

Durability: Save time by avoiding ironing. Throw it in your bag, no folding necessary.
Comfort: Adventure Wear boasts a soft, smooth fabric that provides a comfortable wearing experience.

Keep Clean: Stains wash out with water, ensuring you always look your best.


Look Great: The Adventure Wear fabric blend allows water to dry and sweat spots to evaporate quickly.

This is the next generation of travel wear. Gone are the days of stains, wrinkles, soggy clothes, and bulky travel bags. 
Adventure Wear will be the one nice shirt you need on your trip. Stains come out, it won’t wrinkle, and it dries quickly, leaving you cool and ready for the day or night. 

Where I got the Idea:
While staying in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I made friends with several Italian immigrants who, like me, were trying to eke out a living and extend their stay. Some of their friends from Italy came to visit during the Sao Vito festival, which is basically a two month party celebrating all things Italian.
Of course, we had to take them out to celebrate. Unfortunately, they would only be there from Monday until Thursday. Keep in mind, I was traveling, so I only had one nice shirt. I just had to wash it a lot. We were out all night in typical Brazilian style, drinking wine until the sun rose the next day.
It was about this time I looked down to realize my clothes were completely ruined. We had left from work, and this left no time to change. Now it was time to go to work again, and my clothes were covered in grease, wine, and mud. No way I could go in looking like that. I panicked for about an hour, tried to clean my shirt off, but only made it wet in addition to dirty. Finally I called a friend and borrowed a shirt from him.
The next morning I was late, and in trouble. That made me think: What if I had a shirt that could match the flexible and unpredictable life of a traveler?

The SolutionI realized that travelers needed something to lighten their load. Something versatile and resilient that could go on as many trips as they did. A shirt that they could wear to work, to the bar, to the Tomatina, whatever, then just wash it off and wear it again the next day.Pictured: Adventure                                                              Via WikipediaWhat is it?Adventure Wear has been in the making for almost a year now. In that time I have worked with several different designers in an attempt to find the perfect fabric: a blend of natural and synthetic fibers to maximize comfort,  dry speed, style, and durability. I also researched many different nano washes to find the maximum stain release and resistant formulas. Once I brought the fabric and the stain-release formula together, I began testing prototypes to find the perfect blend of fabric and concentration of stain-release to make the best shirt for travelers. The tests I did include both in-house, controlled tests with specific substances and real life tests. I also gave the shirts to friends who I knew would be doing traveling or other adventurous things so they could give me independent feedback as to how Adventure Wear works in real life. You can see the data table from the tests and their testimonies below.The fabric is a blend of cotton and polyester and is rated wrinkle proof and has the quick dry certification. The shirts are made in humane conditions by workers paid a fair wage in Taiwan, and then imported to the US.
Our GoalOur goal at Adventure Wear is to make life easier for travelers and professionals everywhere. Why worry about your nice clothes when you can just ball them up and throw them in your suitcase? Why let grease stains make you change your whole wardrobe? The shirts are made from a blend of polyester and cotton, which gives them a combination of breathability, durability, and comfort. Applied to the fabric is a stain-release treatment that we have tested both at the office and in real world trials to determine how durable the shirts are. See the chart above for exact data. The design is intended to look good in and out of the office, and keep you comfortable and dry while traveling.                                                                Photo by Greg Bull PhotographyYour ContributionWith the support of Indiegogo and people like you, we will be able to start manufacturing Adventure Wear full time.

'From Berlin to Beijing'
My name is Janine Grosche. I was born and raised in germany and i currently live and work in Beijing, China.
I have studied Fashiondesign at ESMOD Berlin from where i graduated in 2007 with a specialisation in menswear. As a school representative i was chosen to show my graduation collection at the 15th Hempel Award in Beijing during China Fashion Week.
As life goes my way brought me back to Chinas capital and i started to work as a Fashion Designer for a well known chinese Fashion Company.
After all i started to build my own label 'PATH' based in Beijing, which focuses on contemporary menswear. After my recent collection 'Ideal Disorder' for spring summer 2012 i have now the opportunity to show my upcoming collection for spring summer 2013 at an exclusive Fashionevent during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Berlin.
 
THE FASHIONSHOW
'Exclusivity & Significance'
I have been selected to show a 15 – 20 piece collection from my label 'PATH' at this Fashionevent which is initiated by ESMOD Berlin and where im invited to have the Final Show as an ESMOD Alumni, for what i have to fly with my entire collection from Beijing to Berlin.
This incredibly anticipated show is the Opening for Mercedes-Benz Fashionweek Berlin and provides an amazing opportunity for me to show PATH to a professional audience of people from the entire fashionindustry and international media. 
The Fashion Show will be hold at an extraordinary location in Berlin, the 'German Historical Museum', which is devoted to German History and defines itself as a place of enlightenment and understanding of the shared history of Germans and Europeans. It is beyond words that i have to mention how incredibly honored i feel to show my collection at this particular singular institution. This venue is especially exclusive, because this is the 1st time ever that a Fashionshow will take place. That fact makes it exceptionally unexpected, unique and oustanding from all regular Fashion Events in Berlin.
 
THE MEANING
'Behind the Scene'
To date I have funded the production of my previous collection entirely independently - working very hard and long hours on designing the actual collection as well as taking care of all creative direction from fotoshoots to coorporate identity of the label. Im also handle the entire Marketing and PR, promoting my brand on several networking pages and international fashion platforms. It is indeed a full-time job than just 'a' collection that im having fun with to create... It is my dream and actual goal to let PATH become a well-known Fashionbrand.
Through sponsorship contributions I am hoping get a step closer on my 'path' to go for my dreams and to raise approximately $6,000 by the end of Mai. This amount is the absolute minimum i calculated to make this possible.
This money will enable me to design and produce the new spring summer collection 2013, accessorise the collection and to shoot the lookbook for the entire range. I am currently approaching reputable industry leaders and the general public for contributions of any amount to help to cover these expenses and make the launch of this collection possible and of course as professional as expected.

We will be reaching out if there are any questions about your address or perk. Thanks!Our passion for hammocking, love of the outdoors, and appreciation for the highest quality gear led us to redesign the hammock strap. The Ultimate Strap is SLIMMER, LIGHTER, and EXTREMELY PACKABLE. All the while maintaining the strength and length of the industry's top selling hammock straps.Nano Weave™ TechnologyThis new technology makes the Ultimate Strap more than 2x lighter and sleeker than competing straps without sacrificing strength or durability. Take a look:Nano Weave™ Taper Here's where we drop the weight. We taper down the strap from 1 inch to .5 inch, thinning out 60% of the strap by HALF.By Nano Weaving™ the fibers together, the bottom of the taper remains just as strong as the top, and so does the rest of the strap. This means less material, less weight, and the same strength.Nano Weave™ LoopingOur Nano Weave™ straps are free of stitching, aka the weak points.Traditional stitching is used to construct most hammock straps. This leaves behind ridges, bulk, and worst of all, WEAK LINKS. There's a reason why so many products are double, triple, and even quadruple stitched, right?Bark + Cambium ProtectionLike any other hammock lounger, we care about the trees. We made the strap 1 inch wide to avoid girdling and damage to the bark and cambium.

    Deux Janus - NE86 Automatic   Redefining the ChronographA well-crafted chronograph watch offers the perfect meld of engineering and style. But sometimes, all those complex mechanics can feel somewhat overbearing. Especially when all you want is to know how much time has passed in the day without having to worry about anything else.Of course, not to get a chronograph would be to miss out on the cutting-edge precision such a device offers.We looked at the current range of chronographs out there and we couldn’t find a reasonably priced watch where you could turn off and on the complexity at will.So, we decided to create one of our own… One with all the features and professional look of top-end high-street watches. Now, we’re proud to present the Deux dual-faced automatic chronograph.A Watch You Can Change to Suit Your Mood We’ve engineered into the Deux Collection a one-turn adjustable diaphragm. Simply twist the front face clockwise to close the aperture, revealing a sleek,zen-like design.Turn the watch the other way to reveal the precision display with easily legible time indicators and second and minute chronograph dials. So, no matter if you’re in the mood for simplicity or precision, the Deux Collection will cater to your needs.Designed for collectors or those who appreciate fine things, this automatic chronograph is an essential item for any distinguished collection.You’ll also be pleased to hear that the Deux Collection is a limited edition which will be retired after 500 timepieces.   OUR WARRANTYDeux Watches offers a two-year warranty. If your watch is suffering from any mechanical or structural defect,  you send your watch back to us.  It’s All About the MovementA great watch isn’t just about the design, but the mechanics that power it.The Deux Janus is powered by the brand-new 34-jewel Seiko NE86 movement with a power reserve of 45 hours. This lightweight movement vibrates at a rate of 28,000 Hz an hour, offering intense precision, both for the watch and the chronograph. And we've taken things one step further by introducing the Deux Janus Elite, with a superior Swiss Caliber SW500 movement, for those who want the absolute best out of their watch.After a lot of market research, we came away impressed by the specifications that Seiko and Swiss Sellita offer in their movements. Their technology combines a column wheel and a vertical clutch, which gives the watch great vibrations, without the jerkiness that you often find in similar watches.It took us a long time to find the ideal movement for the Deux Janus Collection which wouldn’t drastically increase the cost of the watch.We believe we made the right choice with the Seiko NE86 and Sellita as it helps keep the watch lightweight, while still being amazingly accurate and feeling great on the wrist as it ticks away.Other FeaturesWe’ve worked hard to design a watch that has the high-quality of much more expensive high-street brands without costing the earth.The Deux Collection has everything you expect from a top-of-the-range watch, including:Sapphire scratch proof glass to protect your watch from wear and tearHighly durable tempered stainless steel with laser-cut engravings on the back faceA premium hand-crafted Italian leather strap with an optional add-on metal strapA low weightAnd a great look and feel that will make you feel proud to wear the Deux Watches, whatever the occasion     Deux Janus Elite - Swiss Movement  Deux Chimera - Automatic 9122For those on a lower budget, we’re proud to offer the Deux Chimera.

<h3>About PaperFlops</h3>
<p>PaperFlops is a creative workshop that employs underprivileged people including disabled people throughout Yogyakarta, Indonesia. </p>
<p>The workshop creates various unique handmade products made from recycled and up-cycled newspapers and other natural materials. All of the materials used in our workshop are environmentally friendly and sustainable. The products produced in our workshop include flip flops, sandals, bags, pencil boxes, and more.</p>
<p>Our best selling product are the flip flops and sandals made from recycled and upcycled newspapers. These Flip Flops are made of recycled and up-cycled newspapers. It takes approximately<strong> 1kg of old newspapers</strong> to produce a pair of PaperFlops Flip Flops. Other materials for the PaperFlop Flip Flops include root from old palm trees, coconut shells, and 100% natural rubber. The PaperFlop Flip Flops are quite <strong>durable</strong> and<strong> water proof</strong> since they are protected with a <strong>natural rubber sealant</strong>. Also, since each and every PaperFlop is individually handmade, we can create a pair for any shoe size. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Currently, we are working out of a small garage with the size of <span>2.4 × 4.9 m and some of the weaving done outdoors. This situation has limited our production capacity and our ability to recruit more underprivileged people to work at our workshop. We plan to <strong>lease a small warehouse</strong> (8.2 x 12.3 m) for 3 years so  we can help more people and increase our production. For this, we need your help. </span></p>

</div></div>","Digit Images needs your support!  Read all about us and check out our rewards to the right.   Join us in helping to launch an exciting new fashion accessory line to adorn your fingernails. Your contribution will help to fund these quirky, beautiful and elegant artificial nails. With over 30 unique designs you can accent your wardrobe and show-off your personality one image at a time or mix and match!



Being a true fashionista is more than your clothes—it's the way you
accessorize!  Now you can showcase  your style with fingernails from Digit Images! 
Our goal is to develop and offer this one-of-a-kind, unique technology  to transfer thousands of images onto high quality artificial nails--not just a decal or nail wrap. Drugstores only have a limited selection and nail salons can sometimes be expensive, so what’s a girl to do? Shop Digit Images and let your finger(tips) show the way!


We have at least 30 designs and every month we will be offering at least 10 new designs. We have 7 different categories . . .





That's because the last category is in a class by itself — 24ct gold gilded nails that will stun your friends with that feeling of luxury and beauty. They shimmer like no paint can. Each comes with 20 nails and a certificate of authenticity to prove they are the real thing.



Later we plan to introduce The Number 1 Fan to flaunt your favorite team colors after a successful launch!  In the spirit of fun your nails will come in an elegant gift box.  This way you can look glamorous immediately.





We are giving our nail aficionados two ways to participate in receiving the nails: You can become a member of Taylor’s Nailers or you can receive nails for the retail price.   Gift them to a friend or a loved one.  Wear them and share them.
As a member, we send you a survey with 10 new designs each month and you get to vote on your favorites. The design that gets the most votes will be the “Nail of the Month”, which you will receive the following month. 
You will also receive additional discounts; free shipping and a gift when you join for our full year Club 12, six month Club 6 membership, or our three month trial period, Club 3.

<p> Remote access to real-time data of rock movement is imperative to protect not only motorists on the country's roads and highways, but also for state highway departments of transportation to provide management of the state's assets.  TalonSentry and the Talon sensors provide just that - remote access to real time data of all types including movement, moisture and temperature.  In addition, the TalonSentry allows for remote video verification of problems that may exist in traditionally inaccessible locations.  It is our goal to help keep the roadways safe for all of those who travel on them. </p>

<h3><strong>Who We Are-</strong></h3>
<p><strong> S</strong>ilent Solutions LLC is a small woman-owned limited liability company that provides solutions for security applications in non-traditional outdoor markets.  We pride ourselves on our ability to assess each site as a unique entity, and provide innovative approaches to a client’s intrusion detection, surveillance, asset protection and monitoring needs.  There is no ‘vanilla’ solution in our business.</p>
<p> Silent Solutions provides integrated electronic security solutions that incorporate innovative technologies with our proven TalonSentry platform.  Solutions include state of the art electronic security panels, wireless long range sensors, cellular communications, solar power assemblies, IP cloud video cameras with access through a central server, smart phone access for remote camera viewing, and off –site monitoring that virtually eliminates false alarms. </p>
<p> In each and every instance, Silent Solutions has exceeded the expectations of its clients, protecting literally billions of dollars of assets from loss, overseeing the protection of heavy equipment, tools, building materials, copper pipes and electrical wiring, and a wide array of other valuable assets. Our ability to build a hardened wall around nearly any sized outdoor environment or project is truly what differentiates us from the traditional security providers.</p>
<p> Our unique approaches to securing sites have gained us the trust of our extensive customer base and distinguished us from any potential competitor. As such, we have been taken our proprietary approach to sites in five western states, where our clients have requested us to provide our level of unparalleled protection. These core business innovations have allowed us to transfer our business model to other ever-changing markets, opening doors to additional revenues.</p>
<p> After witnessing the results first-hand of the damage and devastation that rockfalls and landslides can cause across the world, as well as the number of lives cut short by these terrible accidents, we here at Silent Solutions wanted to find a way to restructure our technologies so that they could be implemented primarily as a life-safety device, but also be a way to help protect the states’ economies from the billions upon billions of dollars of losses that are suffered every time the highways are shut down.  We started development of the TalonSentry and Talon devises, which has led us to our current relationship with the Colorado Department of Transportation.</p>

<h3><strong>Today…</strong></h3>
<p>  Silent Solutions is now actively involved with the several Departments of Transportation (DOT’s), at various Rockfall Monitoring sites, providing unique solutions to the extremely difficult area of rockfall mitigation in even the most remote projects.  The importance of this task is to provide a life-safety element that alerts state personal of pending catastrophic releases before the rocks have an opportunity to actually fall.  It is our goal to save the lives of travelers wherever possible and also be able to give cleanup crews a shield of protection while they are at risk, working under unstable hillsides.</p>
<p> To date, Silent Solutions has perfected over four applications that have the potential to solve massive problems within the transportation industry.  We believe that the following technology represents the future of rockfall and landslide solutions…</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;"">  <img alt=""Sensor near edge of frame by climber"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.silentsolutionssecurity.com/publishImages/Project-Gallery~~element44~~41.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Monitoring I-70""/></p>
<h3><strong>TalonSentry-</strong></h3>
<p> TalonSentry is a revolutionary mobile, self-contained landslide and rockfall monitoring platform that provides the most advanced elements of wireless security, while remaining technologically agnostic to equipment with which it interfaces.  TalonSentry can communicate with nearly any type of existing sensing device and has the ability to interface with a powerful pan/tilt/zoom camera, allowing remote real-time viewing of areas of concern as well as the recording of actual video footage to an off-site secure server located thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>  TalonSentry uses an imbedded aircard to transmit data from the remote locations where it is placed. With a quad core processor imbedded as a part of it’s single board Linux based operating system, as well as a solid state 64 Gig hard drive, 1.7 Gigs of RAM and 2 Gigs of memory, this ruggedized computer effectively has no moving parts and is only 1.25” X 1.25” in size.</p>
<p> Because it operates on 5 VDC, the system is perfect for alternative sources of power, such as solar, wind or fuel cell applications. These features allow TalonSentry to provide landslide and rockfall security warning applications in the most difficult environments, offering protection to equipment, manpower resources and assets in locations that traditionally would have been impossible to protect.</p>
<p> Since TalonSentry utilizes the national cellular network to communicate, it allows for complete bi-directional communications. Data messages can be sent remotely to the computer and then on to each of the sensing devices, allowing changes to be made to sensor configurations on the fly. By allowing true remote operation and query of devices that may be spread across the nation or across the world, the TalonSentry can check system status, input/battery condition, radio signal strength, sensitivity levels and active transmitter status, all of which can be changed or reviewed remotely. No other data collection network offers this level of information or flexibility, thus revolutionizing the applications where TalonSentry can be used.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""> <img alt=""Rockfall Mitigation with Talon R90"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.silentsolutionssecurity.com/publishImages/Project-Gallery~~element44~~42.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""Talon R90 ""/></p>
<h3><strong>Talon-</strong></h3>
<p> The “Talon R-90” and is a low -powered, extremely accurate movement sensor developed specifically for landslide and rockfall applications, that could indicate that a slope or hillside is about to slide, or that rocks might release and fall. They were created for use where there is a need to monitor and react to varying degrees of movement and vibration.  Each Talon sensor has specific capabilities to adjust sensitivity levels and operational status, and the onboard radios create a mesh network between each sensor, reaching out over 3 miles, assuring that the data from each sensor arrives in perfect condition to the monitoring computer or data hub for transmission on to a SQL server.</p>
<p> The Talon sensor also incorporates a communications interface that allows it to introduce a number of divergent external sensors, such as an ultrasonic sonar that becomes an extremely accurate “crack meter” on rough-terrain hillsides. Or it can be attached to a hydrometer probe and measure the level of ground saturation or moisture. It can also become an active weather station, collecting real-time data on wind speed, direction, and amount of rainfall and temperature fluctuations, all from the same board.</p>
<p> As we continue to strive to find additional solutions that will allow us to incorporate already exiting technologies into our dynamic network, what we have developed is revolutionizing the whole landslide and rockfall mitigation industry, and it’s all being done with some very powerful and yet relatively inexpensive tools that will change the face of “predictability” forever.</p>

<p>Destefic clothing is an idea I came up with in 2010, I’ve always wanted to do it but haven’t really had the resources to develop it, into what I want it to be.</p>
<p>My Name is Shaun and I recently finished graphic design. Creating artwork is what I'm passionate about, but there’s something special about creating and designing for clothing.</p>
<p>I’ve basically created this campaign to get Destefic off its butt and into the world. I’m selling these tee’s at dirt cheap prices with not much profit, but hopefully enough to produce the second set of designs and most importantly produce my online store.</p>

<h3>What is Cross Culture?</h3>
<p>Cross Culture is an idea that was born out of an experiment in 2009. Like most experiments, it first started with a question : ""How come African fabrics, with all their colour and vibrance, are not part of the mainstream fashion"".</p>
<p>We believed the richness of colours and prints in African fabric could add a new dimension to the urban trend. We decided to test the idea, so we bought a sewing machine, some African fabric and a plain hoodie. The results of the experiment can be seen below.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/1322/files/kentehoodie.jpg?139"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We made 14 of the hoodies you see above and they sold out in a week!</p>
<p>We decided to try another experiment. To enhance the urban look, we collaborated with a popular graphic artist in Japan, Yamamoto Shigetomo, whose design is used by the likes of fashion icons such as Anna Sui. He designed some unique graphics for us to be used on hoodies and t-shirts.</p>

<p>The Monster Girl hoodie was our second creation. We knew this idea would create a new trend when someone bought the hoodie straight off the press from the print shop. Subsequently, our first batch of products sold out within a week, again!</p>
<p>We then decided to work with exciting designers from different parts of the world to create a graphic t-shirt range. We mixed an African print called 'Kente' with contemporary artwork to create the 'Kente Collection' of t-shirts. Each of these graphics has a story behind it.</p>

What is Cross Culture?
Cross Culture is an idea that was born out of an experiment in 2009. Like most experiments, it first started with a question : ""How come African fabrics, with all their colour and vibrance, are not part of the mainstream fashion"".
We believed the richness of colours and prints in African fabric could add a new dimension to the urban trend. We decided to test the idea, so we bought a sewing machine, some African fabric and a plain hoodie. The results of the experiment can be seen below.

We made 14 of the hoodies you see above and they sold out in a week!
We decided to try another experiment. To enhance the urban look, we collaborated with a popular graphic artist in Japan, Yamamoto Shigetomo, whose design is used by the likes of fashion icons such as Anna Sui. He designed some unique graphics for us to be used on hoodies and t-shirts.

<p><b>LIVE: </b>We are currently live on Reddit hosting an AMA, if you have any questions about the JESP project, check it out now! <a href=""http://redd.it/2bu7zg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://redd.it/2bu7zg</a><br/></p> <p>The JESP is an idea that I've had for a while. The idea to bring back steam power for anyone who wants it. Steam power is used by many large power stations as an efficent and simple way to convert heat energy into electrical energy.</p>
<p>I want this to be possible for anyone who wants it.</p>
<p>Once the overall design is ready for the steam engine, it can be used with almost any type of fuel to generate mechanical or electrical energy. It could also be used with concentrated solar, though that can be a rather complicated endevour.</p>
<p>I've always had an interest in engineering and how it can help us in our everyday lives. Though a steam engine may seem a waste of resources in the days of petrol engines, it may be cheaper, and more eco friendly, given the wide range of possible fuels. It is my hope that it could be made into a better alternative to restrictive internal combustion engines for portable generators, and perhaps even be useful for transportation.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/745304/files/20140726100736-2014-07-26_13.48.31.jpg?1406394456"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Funding - Stage One</h3> <p>The first part of the funding, this campaign will be for the research, development, and production of a smaller scale version of the JESP. This small version will operate using a candle as the heat source, will run for only a few minutes, and will only provide a small amount of power. The design will be released freely once completed, allowing anyone with the tools and parrts to create one. It will also be available as a perk on this campaign, as well as for sale after the campaign.</p>
<p>The amount requested, £500, is the smallest allowed on this site, and reflects the estimated cost to design, test and produce around 30 (after the prototypes and such). Because a lot of the cost is in overheads and development, it may be posdible if we reach beyond the target to lower the cost per unit. In this case a new price will be set and a refund of the difference offered to all of the original contributors.</p>
<p>Most of the experimentation and manufacturing will take place at my local Hackspace, Nottinghack, where I have been a member for a couple of years, and so some of the funding will be directed that way due to my increasing usage of the spacee, the rest will be spent on parts, materials and additional tools required.</p>
<p>All this will of course be logged, as I believe in open, transparent research and technology.</p>
<p>What you will get for your contribution (over £16) will be a fully functional mini steam engine, which can be powered by a tealight. I'll probably include a tealight or two unless it goes massively over budget!</p>

</div></div>","JESP
LIVE: We are currently live on Reddit hosting an AMA, if you have any questions about the JESP project, check it out now! http://redd.it/2bu7zg The JESP is an idea that I've had for a while. The idea to bring back steam power for anyone who wants it. Steam power is used by many large power stations as an efficent and simple way to convert heat energy into electrical energy.
I want this to be possible for anyone who wants it.
Once the overall design is ready for the steam engine, it can be used with almost any type of fuel to generate mechanical or electrical energy. It could also be used with concentrated solar, though that can be a rather complicated endevour.
I've always had an interest in engineering and how it can help us in our everyday lives. Though a steam engine may seem a waste of resources in the days of petrol engines, it may be cheaper, and more eco friendly, given the wide range of possible fuels. It is my hope that it could be made into a better alternative to restrictive internal combustion engines for portable generators, and perhaps even be useful for transportation.



  Funding - Stage One The first part of the funding, this campaign will be for the research, development, and production of a smaller scale version of the JESP. This small version will operate using a candle as the heat source, will run for only a few minutes, and will only provide a small amount of power. The design will be released freely once completed, allowing anyone with the tools and parrts to create one. It will also be available as a perk on this campaign, as well as for sale after the campaign.
The amount requested, £500, is the smallest allowed on this site, and reflects the estimated cost to design, test and produce around 30 (after the prototypes and such). Because a lot of the cost is in overheads and development, it may be posdible if we reach beyond the target to lower the cost per unit. In this case a new price will be set and a refund of the difference offered to all of the original contributors.
Most of the experimentation and manufacturing will take place at my local Hackspace, Nottinghack, where I have been a member for a couple of years, and so some of the funding will be directed that way due to my increasing usage of the spacee, the rest will be spent on parts, materials and additional tools required.
All this will of course be logged, as I believe in open, transparent research and technology.
What you will get for your contribution (over £16) will be a fully functional mini steam engine, which can be powered by a tealight. I'll probably include a tealight or two unless it goes massively over budget!
After this stage I will open up funding for the research, development and manufacture of the full sized JESP engine. The basic JESP will be gas powered (most likely butane) for simplicity of operation, but will be built in such a way that it can be heated by any source of heat/fire. Since most of the basics of the smaller engine can be scaled up, stage one will make stage two a lot easier.
  The Impact All contributions for this will be put into research and manufacturing related to the steam engine. You will not only be helping create a small proof of concept, but you will also be helping create the larger, more useful model (which will be on here shortly).The JESP Micro will also be a product able to be used for education on steam power for both adults and kids alike who are interested in the concept.
  Risks & Challenges  The risks are minimal -- this one is but a small step towards a larger goal. The key challenges will be working on the turbine as small steam turbines are anything but common and the entire turbine system will need to be custom designed and built. I do have a design for one that will work, but it may be a challenge to optimise it a bit more. The more funding, the more experimentation I can do and hopefully the more efficient the end product.

</div></div>","Five pieces for men and women that are both timely and timeless!
Wouldn’t it be great if you had a
handful of pieces in your closet that you knew – no matter what you paired them
with – were a sure way to the most stylish you? That armed with these perfectly
curated, essential pieces, you were going to be the best-dressed and most
confident YOU that you could be that day? Well, look no further. Meet Jake
by JAKE.


Jake by JAKE
combines simplicity with style and craftsmanship to clothing. We take the
spectrum of style and distill it down to several original pieces essential for each
season. These five easy pieces for men and five easy pieces for women are made
out of the finest quality materials in the most responsible of ways and brought
directly to you. Jake by JAKE is for people
who feel that their style is a way of saying who they are without having to
speak.We crowd-funded our
first production run of our new limited-edition ready-to-wear line this spring.
We were blown away by how enthusiastically it was received. Now that we’ve
nearly finished manufacturing all of the garments for the first run, we have
the capacity to expand the availability of this perennial ready-to-wear line as part of
Indiegogo’s new InDemand service. This way, more of you will now be able to
wear JAKE – though Jake by JAKE is still
limited edition, so you should act now.


Jake by
JAKE
is designed and made in San Francisco. For us, this is about more than just
being MADE IN THE USA, this is about revitalizing an industry in the city that
was once the bustling home of clothing manufacturing on the West Coast. With
our San Francisco-made philosophy, each collection we produce in the city
brings a job multiplier of 19. This means that each piece of Jake
by JAKE makes a difference not just to the city, but to
a San Franciscan and an American who takes pride in putting their unique skills
into practice at a truly livable wage… yet another reason people leave their
hearts in San Francisco.

Over the last few years we've had the
pleasure to meet and work with some amazing individuals and organizations. Your
support not only contributes to creating industry-specific jobs within San
Francisco, it also allows us to continue our steadfast dedication to giving
back to some amazing charitable partners and the community in which we live and
work.LIMITED EDITIONJake by
JAKE
is about perfection, not mass production. These super-premium pieces were designed to be
timely and timeless, which is why they are being produced only as LIMITED RUNS.
Once they're gone, they're gone. This is not something that everyone has, this
is something that you have. It's bold luxury clothing designed out of luxury
materials in small handcrafted batches so that each offering is carefully
curated and passed along to you as one of just a few, perfected in every
detail. Each USA-made piece is its own work of art and is signed and numbered by each
team member.


JAKE exists
for one very simple reason: we believe that style is about the individual.
Our style speaks volumes about each of us without us uttering a
single word. It is distinct. It is unique. And we love that. Over the last two
years we've been working hard to establish AND perfect the cornerstone of our
offering – custom and bespoke suiting and shirting for men and for women. We
have a passion for making things in a classic way with new twists… and maybe
because we also like a good challenge. At JAKE
we have always been classic yet modern with a defiant twist. 


LOOK WHO'S TALKING...






Now, only with your help, we’re introducing Jake by JAKE to
expand beyond bespoke suiting and shirting to touch many more elements of the
fashion world – without losing the quality and craftsmanship that make our
products exceptional.




Now that we've got your attention allow us the pleasure of introducing JAKE - five easy pieces for men and five easy pieces for women.  Early bird specials won't last long so jump in while you can before First Adopter pricing kicks in.  **NEWLY RELEASED FROM PROJECT RUNWAY**** STANDARD PERKS **

<p>Before I get to the 8 compelling reasons the UK Government agreed to fully authorize and license this recovery project, let me first tell you about our very cool and very exciting Perk for the first 20,000 early bird donors.</p>
<h3>How Our Donors Participate in Recovered Gold History</h3>
<p>With a minimum $195 donation (limited to the first 20,000 donors) you will receive a numbered coupon that confers on you the right to purchase one recovered gold coin (containing approximately one troy ounce of gold) as recovered from the expedition for just $50 US.  PLUS, you get access to the real time, online video documentary of the expedition filmed on the ship as the mission to recover the gold unfolds.</p>

<p>

5. We uncovered documents that prove lost cargo claims were paid by the War Risk Insurance program of the UK government to the owners of the gold cargos.  <b>Paying those lost gold claims is HOW the UK came to own the gold cargos of these ships.</b></p>
<p>

6. <b>We know within 4 meters</b> where the SS Arabic and TSS Hesperian lie on the ocean floor through exclusive 3D multi-beam acoustic images.</p>
<p>
7. Acoustic imaging visually confirmed <b>their secret gold storage facilities</b> remain intact and unopened and are available to our underwater equipment.

<h3>Our Track Record</h3>
<p>The Deep Marine Salvage team have spent decades working on and managing much more complex and deeper water projects than this expedition. The methodology, experience and practical successes and the ability to adapt to unique problems and situations give us a team second to none in this industry.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1009807/files/20141112160902-Recovery_Vessel.jpg?1415837342"" src="""" style=""padding-bottom: 30px; padding-top: 15px;""/>
<h3>The Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Make no mistake: many global salvages have been unsuccessful. But there is a huge difference between ""treasure"" type searches and a licensed, evidence-based recovery mission targeted at shipwrecks that have been surveyed with acoustic micro-beam technologies.</p>
<h3>The challenges in salvage work are:</h3>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
Locating the wreck
</li>
<li>
Condition, depth and how the wreck is lying on the seabed
</li>
<li>
Location within the wreck of the cargo sought
</li>
<li>
Recovery and value of the cargo
</li>
<li>
Ownership and keeping a share of the recovered cargo
</li>
<li>
Management and engineering competence
</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>We know what to expect and are prepared:</b></h3>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
We have GPS positions of each wreck.<br/>
</li>
<li>
Our wrecks lie in less than 200 meters of water, perfectly suited for our methodology of recovery. <br/>
</li>
<li>
We have documentation detailing how and where precious metals were stored. <br/>
</li>
<li>
The recovery plan has been designed to surgically gain access to the correct area of the wrecks and then efficiently recover the cargo assets. Our personnel have hands on practical experience in this type of work. <br/>
</li>
<li>
Licensing with the government department that has legal oversight and ownership of the cargoes is in place. Having legal permission and title to the cargo means no delays or legal issues after the fact and as such this will ensure the fastest completion of the mission of the Expedition. <br/>
</li>
<li>
Many years of practical experience on salvage projects give our staff and contractors an invaluable edge in conducting our project to the best and highest standards of efficiency and safety.<br/>
</li>
</ol>

The Deep Marine Salvage team have spent decades working on and managing much more complex and deeper water projects than this expedition. The methodology, experience and practical successes and the ability to adapt to unique problems and situations give us a team second to none in this industry.

The Risks & Challenges
Make no mistake: many global salvages have been unsuccessful. But there is a huge difference between ""treasure"" type searches and a licensed, evidence-based recovery mission targeted at shipwrecks that have been surveyed with acoustic micro-beam technologies.
The challenges in salvage work are:



Locating the wreck


Condition, depth and how the wreck is lying on the seabed


Location within the wreck of the cargo sought


Recovery and value of the cargo


Ownership and keeping a share of the recovered cargo


Management and engineering competence


We know what to expect and are prepared:



We have GPS positions of each wreck.


Our wrecks lie in less than 200 meters of water, perfectly suited for our methodology of recovery. 


We have documentation detailing how and where precious metals were stored. 


The recovery plan has been designed to surgically gain access to the correct area of the wrecks and then efficiently recover the cargo assets. Our personnel have hands on practical experience in this type of work. 


Licensing with the government department that has legal oversight and ownership of the cargoes is in place. Having legal permission and title to the cargo means no delays or legal issues after the fact and as such this will ensure the fastest completion of the mission of the Expedition. 


Many years of practical experience on salvage projects give our staff and contractors an invaluable edge in conducting our project to the best and highest standards of efficiency and safety.


PLEASE JOIN US In This Amazing Expedition!
We proved to the officials in charge, within a reasonable doubt, that the gold is there and we are the team to bring it back to the world. We have invested several years and millions of dollars to get all the evidence and to conduct the survey work that is now completed.
Our goal is to give you the opportunity to help us fund the remaining costs of salvage and to participate in the adventure online and a piece of the gold cargo we recover. At the end of this campaign, if more funds are needed to complete the Expedition, we will bring in large private investors after first extending this opportunity for people like you to participate in this exciting adventure.
With the successful recovery of the gold lost for 99 years in Late Spring/Early Summer 2015, your early $195 donor status earns you the right to participate online and purchase a true piece of history as recovered for just $50.
It’s an amazing Perk for an amazing technological achievement—join us today with your donation!

<h3>                                How It All Started!</h3>
<p>Did you know that the average person throws away roughly 70 pounds of clothing and textile every year? This is equivalent to 3.8 billion pounds of added waste to our landfills. Scary figures, right? </p>
<p> <img alt=""Landfill"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BMVVAA9uyAU/UGs49bFd02I/AAAAAAAAADE/RGTUWHTbfvs/s1600/shutterstock_60108481_Landfill.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 531px; height: 316px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After learning more about the daunting reality of clutter build up of our landfills, I gave my closet a deep personal inspection. How did I manage to accumulate this much clothes? Where did they all come from? It was really scary to find out just how much used clothing I have collected over the years. After opening endless amounts of cardboard boxes filled with ridiculously outdated clothing, I found something that really brought warmth to my heart – a hand-knit cardigan made by my grandmother. This cardigan was too special to let go of. How can I preserve this memorable item? This was the moment Needle Happy became a reality. </p>
<h3>                                 </h3>
<h3>                                Why Needle Happy?</h3>
<p>My job through Needle Happy is to remind everyone that if each and every one of us makes efforts in recycling clothing and textiles, our landfills will be filled with less clutter. </p>
<p>I am pretty sure that there are many of you that have closets full of clothes that you cannot seem to cut ties with because of fond memories, like the hand-knit cardigan my grandmother made for me or you saved clothes for later when you shed a few pounds (Yup, I have tons of those). When the time comes when you decide to tackle that outrageous pile of unwanted clothes, I kindly ask that you think about our environment and our landfills. Consider recycling your clothing the creative way and utilize our recycling process. Send in those pair of jeans that you refuse to throw out and have our in-house designers personally revamp them into a custom handmade bag made especially for you and no one else or purchase our ready-made products made out of 100% recycled fabrics. Needle Happy is the solution to turning around mad chaos of unwanted clothing into stylish custom accessories, while saving our landfill from unnecessary clutter. We think Needle Happy is a pretty stylish idea towards saving our environment, wouldn't you agree? </p>

<div>      My name is Eric Peterson.<br/>I've been a gamer since I could hold a controller.  I have obsessed over geek pop-culture since before it was ""pop"" and was just ""geek culture"".  I've also had an incredible interest in the mechanical aspect of everything I come in contact with. And by extensions a massive interest in electronics.  My lifelong dream has been to be able to merge all of those things and create something. In a way, I'm an artist in my own form.  </div>
<div>     For the last 2 years I have been brainstorming, designing, testing, and imagining on how I could put these elements of my life together.  Put that on rinse and repeat, and that's how I arrived at this idea several months ago. It hit me when I saw my lovely girlfriend wearing a pendant I had created in my high school shop class several years prior.</div>
<div>     This campaign would allow me to obtain the equipment needed to create all of the wonderful ideas that have filled my head and been suggested to me over the last few months. What you see in the gallery is only a small portion of what will be available.  These are just general examples of what I will be creating, as well as specific designs I've created in the last few weeks specifically for the purpose of this campaign.  Everything I create will be available on an Etsy store, and possibly a website if I am successful.  Except a select few ""one of a kind"" items of course.</div>
<div>      Not only would you be helping realize a lifelong dream of mine, but you would be bringing the joy of these objects to others as well.  I am also a cosplayer and frequently attend conventions of all sorts (Comic Con and the like).  And would love to be able to open a booth for my local conventions, to help bring these products to those who would enjoy them most.  I would fund all of this myself, but financially I just can't do it. Being as frugal as possible it would take me close to 2 years at best to come up with some bare minimum equipment.  This campaign can cut that time down to 30 days, and allow me to afford the equipment necessary to produce much higher quality, and intricate pieces.</div> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What is Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>      I am hopeful that I can raise $3,500. That would cover:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>The hand tools required for different shaping operations (files, pliers, calipers, etc)</li>
<li>The various tools needed for finishing jewelry/polishing</li>
<li>Molding and casting supplies and tools</li>
<li>A sufficient kiln for heating the castings</li>
<li>A vacuum table for ensuring the castings are as detailed as possible, as well as the resulting pieces retain that detail</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">A dedicated melting furnace to keep a ready supply of metal ready to be cast when each cast is ready</span>
</li>
</ul></div>
<p>      As for perks, a whole range of different items will be offered.  Most of the items given here will all be available later to be sold on the Etsy store.  With the exception of a few campaign only items.  As well as discounts on purchases made at the Etsy store.  A small portion of which are displayed in the Gallery.</p>
<p>      See the list to the right for more details on perks.  And heads up, ALL perks come with a coupon for the Etsy store!</p>
<p>      If the funding fails to reach the goal, they will be used to purchase as much of the equipment as possible.  See the ""Goal sheet"" in the gallery for a breakdown of which order funds will be applied.  Any OVER funding will go towards the purchase of a 3D printer that works with casting wax, significantly increasing production as well as cutting down the wait time before new designs can be put into production.  If this campaign doesn't meet the lowest funding point on the goal sheet, then the funds will either be refunded, or held onto until the remaining funds can be collected, which will become my top priority for my backers.</p>

<h3>What has already been accomplished</h3>      Everything on the business side of things has already been taken care of.  All of the proper licensing has been done, as well as tax related registrations.  I have several business accounts set up with various distributors. The main one (where the silver itself is purchased) is highly reputable for it's exclusive use of recycled metals and non conflict precious gems.  As well as suppliers for shipping materials, tooling, and general casting materials.<p>I have also created dozens of models of jewelry alone, many not pictured here.  Not to mention all of the other quality models I've created prior to this, which probably number in the hundreds.</p>
<p>      As you can see, I'm very serious about this project and will see it to completion. I am very invested in making this work.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What will this Impact?</h3>
<p>      This project would create a product that a growing community of cosplayers, gamers, nerds, geeks, or whatever they identify themselves as, could enjoy.  There ins't much in the way of affordable jewelry, let alone jewelry of this custom nature.</p>
<p>      Designs wouldn't be limited to my own imagination, item suggestions would be welcomed and possibly even become commonplace.  As well as customizations on existing items.  Do you want something to be enameled? It can be done.  Do you want your zombie earrings to be missing their left legs instead of their right arm? No problem.  Do you want raised lettering with a special message for that special someone? Done.</p>
<p>      Because everything will be done by me, I can keep all costs at a minimum, and offer a quality product at a very affordable price.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The three biggest challenges of this project are rather simple:</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Work space</li></ul>
<p>A sufficiently sized space that is safe against fire, but is also well ventilated and most importantly safe</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Equipment</li></ul>
<p>The right equipment plus the right person equals a job done right.  A job done right means a quality product</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>Production</li></ul>
<p>The actual creation of the product, from the initial model, to the wax replication, all the way until the object is polished boxed and shipped</p>
<p>      As far as work space, I already have that part covered. I have access to a large automotive shop (owned by family) that I can use to do all of the work in. Sadly it doesn't contain the equipment I need.  That's where this campaign comes in.  With the correct funding, I can obtain what i need for the production.  I feel I'm qualified to produce these objects. I've already created all of the models you see here.  I've also created items like these in the same manner a few years back in the shop class I mentioned earlier.  Not much is more satisfying than pulling the still warm creation you just made out of a cloudy bucket of water and plaster that was just searing moments ago.  The hours of work become worth it in a single instant.</p>

<h2><strong>Project Summary and Intro to Conformé</strong></h2>
Conformé, LLC was founded in 2011 by Michael and Debbie Daniele and a team of business analysts as advisors. We are creating the next generation of b2b compliance software. We build iOS and Android apps on mobile and tablet platforms with the educational mission to teach contractors, landlords and homeowners what they need to be successful and hazard-safe in their projects.Conformé is poised to change the world by changing how contractors renovate, rehab and build.  We are going to impact, and revolutionize contracting on a national and global scale with APPS that are easy to use and vitally relevant to current federal, state and local regulations.  We will make compliance easy, work practices understandable and documentation organized.
<h3><strong>We're going to change the world, and if you are passionate about APPS and about changing how contractors deal with hazardous waste we want you with us. Ultimately, it will reduce risks of exposure and save lives.</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign is important to us and we think this is critical enough to solicit your help in raising the necessary funds to continue development. Contractors are buying the app, but it has to get better, easier to use, include enhancement requests and be built to last through the next phase of app usage. It’s a small thing, but it has huge implications. For without the necessary documentation, contractors face huge fines (as in $37,500 each violation). Without it, homeowners, property owners and their surrounding neighborhoods are more at risk of being exposed to the effects of lead poisoning. In addition to the requirements of the EPA, this app will help each contractor and home owner know for certain that their work is done properly. All the regulations are at their fingertips.</p>
<p>Without your support, this project won’t be able to move to the next level in the time frame that is absolutely necessary. Each day that goes by more and more people face risk of being exposed. Children and elderly especially are most at risk. And it’s been proven that any lead levels are too much for our bodies to handle. There are adverse affects and reactions that can cause damage and pain for life. We feel the urgency to complete this project, and put it in the hands of every contractor in the U.S. There is also a movement for this kind of regulation to go global. It’s not just a problem in the States. All over the world, lead paint lays waiting for unsuspecting individuals. Lead dust is the most common and the most deadly. It’s virtually invisible. But yet, it’s really there. It must be removed with proper protocol or the results can be fatal. Not just for the homeowners, but for the contractors. We must get this project completed to make sure we can help lower the risk of this happening even one more time.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What’s In It for YOU!</strong></h3>
<p>We need $15,000. That will be used for the final development for the app, necessary changes and additions as well as adding enhancement requests that will make it much more functional. We have asked for feedback from our users and we have gotten it. They know what they need and how it could work best for them. We just listened.</p>
<p>It will also be used to promote and market this product. We’re not marketing experts by any means. We have some knowledge, but we need help and we’re not afraid to ask for it!  You can be sure that this isn’t going into our piggy banks, or funding our next vacation. There won’t be any vacation until this project is done. It’s just that critical.</p>
<p>Since most of our target for fundraising will be to those who actually could use the product, we want to offer to reward you with free apps, an honorable mention in the app credits, and even part ownership in the company’s profits once we reach profitability. You decide what works for you! We want to encourage you to participate at whatever level is comfortable for you.</p>
<p>This is a huge opportunity to partner with an exciting startup company at an early stage with potential for explosive growth (think global!) and great financial reward. We're all very excited about the idea and know that it will make a huge difference in the world, particularly for children and families who have experienced contamination through renovations.</p>
<h3><strong>What if?</strong></h3>
<p>In the unlikely event that we don’t reach our goal, the collected funds will be used on the above tasks that were outlined, based on priority. We definitely have updates to make and enhancements to add. That will be our primary focus first.</p>
<p>We know this will be a successful project. The app is already being used today by many, many contractors, homeowners, painters, renovators, and even individuals in the real estate business. They tell us that the product is just what they needed and they tell us that it’s great but certain features would make it even better. For instance, some users say it would be such an awesome idea to have the option to print right from the app, meaning, no matter where they are, they can send a command to a specified networked printer and their documentation will print out immediately. We loved the idea, and our developers are already considering how to add this feature. But there are many more ideas just like this one.

</div></span></div>","Project Summary and Intro to Conformé
Conformé, LLC was founded in 2011 by Michael and Debbie Daniele and a team of business analysts as advisors. We are creating the next generation of b2b compliance software. We build iOS and Android apps on mobile and tablet platforms with the educational mission to teach contractors, landlords and homeowners what they need to be successful and hazard-safe in their projects.Conformé is poised to change the world by changing how contractors renovate, rehab and build.  We are going to impact, and revolutionize contracting on a national and global scale with APPS that are easy to use and vitally relevant to current federal, state and local regulations.  We will make compliance easy, work practices understandable and documentation organized.
We're going to change the world, and if you are passionate about APPS and about changing how contractors deal with hazardous waste we want you with us. Ultimately, it will reduce risks of exposure and save lives.
This campaign is important to us and we think this is critical enough to solicit your help in raising the necessary funds to continue development. Contractors are buying the app, but it has to get better, easier to use, include enhancement requests and be built to last through the next phase of app usage. It’s a small thing, but it has huge implications. For without the necessary documentation, contractors face huge fines (as in $37,500 each violation). Without it, homeowners, property owners and their surrounding neighborhoods are more at risk of being exposed to the effects of lead poisoning. In addition to the requirements of the EPA, this app will help each contractor and home owner know for certain that their work is done properly. All the regulations are at their fingertips.
Without your support, this project won’t be able to move to the next level in the time frame that is absolutely necessary. Each day that goes by more and more people face risk of being exposed. Children and elderly especially are most at risk. And it’s been proven that any lead levels are too much for our bodies to handle. There are adverse affects and reactions that can cause damage and pain for life. We feel the urgency to complete this project, and put it in the hands of every contractor in the U.S. There is also a movement for this kind of regulation to go global. It’s not just a problem in the States. All over the world, lead paint lays waiting for unsuspecting individuals. Lead dust is the most common and the most deadly. It’s virtually invisible. But yet, it’s really there. It must be removed with proper protocol or the results can be fatal. Not just for the homeowners, but for the contractors. We must get this project completed to make sure we can help lower the risk of this happening even one more time.
What We Need & What’s In It for YOU!
We need $15,000. That will be used for the final development for the app, necessary changes and additions as well as adding enhancement requests that will make it much more functional. We have asked for feedback from our users and we have gotten it. They know what they need and how it could work best for them. We just listened.
It will also be used to promote and market this product. We’re not marketing experts by any means. We have some knowledge, but we need help and we’re not afraid to ask for it!  You can be sure that this isn’t going into our piggy banks, or funding our next vacation. There won’t be any vacation until this project is done. It’s just that critical.
Since most of our target for fundraising will be to those who actually could use the product, we want to offer to reward you with free apps, an honorable mention in the app credits, and even part ownership in the company’s profits once we reach profitability. You decide what works for you! We want to encourage you to participate at whatever level is comfortable for you.
This is a huge opportunity to partner with an exciting startup company at an early stage with potential for explosive growth (think global!) and great financial reward. We're all very excited about the idea and know that it will make a huge difference in the world, particularly for children and families who have experienced contamination through renovations.
What if?
In the unlikely event that we don’t reach our goal, the collected funds will be used on the above tasks that were outlined, based on priority. We definitely have updates to make and enhancements to add. That will be our primary focus first.
We know this will be a successful project. The app is already being used today by many, many contractors, homeowners, painters, renovators, and even individuals in the real estate business. They tell us that the product is just what they needed and they tell us that it’s great but certain features would make it even better. For instance, some users say it would be such an awesome idea to have the option to print right from the app, meaning, no matter where they are, they can send a command to a specified networked printer and their documentation will print out immediately. We loved the idea, and our developers are already considering how to add this feature. But there are many more ideas just like this one. We need your support to help us over the hurdle of getting it done. Once it’s in the hands of these developers, it should only take two to three weeks to see a brand new version. That is exciting!!

<p>One day, I got home from work, made a sandwich and sat down to catch up on some TV.  Just as I picked up my BLT, my dog Ralph gives me the look ""Pay attention to me!""</p>
<p>The DogClaw was born and the past 2 years have been busy.  Months were dedicated to the design.  A small business was formed.  Marketing campaigns were reviewed. A website was built.  Patent and trademark applications were filed and have been approved.  A substantial investment was made to build the equipment to manufacture the DogClaw.  This has all been completed.  We just need help to make our first production run!</p>
<p>The DogClaw was invented to bring the ultimate scratcher to dogs.  Simply put, the DogClaw is awesome.  With its claw like design the DogClaw is the ultimate scratcher for your dog (horses and other animals love it too!).  The ""scratching talons"" give your dog the deep scratch they want while the ""massaging knuckles"" smoothly glide over your dogs coat.  The ""Hold Anywhere Handle""  allows you to easily adjust your grip for comfort or distance from dog while the Collar Grab allows you to hook your dogs collar when a quick grab is desired. The DogClaw is the ultimate scratcher, and your dog wants one!</p>

<p>With over two years of development the DogClaw is finally ready for production.  The tool to manufacture the DogClaw is complete, and our manufacturing site is ready to go.  The DogClaw will be made in the USA!  In addition the DogClaw will be made using recycled materials and will be available in 3 colors.  Blue, Pink, and Blaze Orange.  </p>

<p><b>Help Jump Start My Career!</b></p>
<p>Hi! I’m Beth Aurora, a makeup artist &amp; licensed esthetician from Los Angeles, California.  (<b>Check out a preview of my portfolio in the
video above! Or check out <a href=""http://www.bethaurora.com)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bethaurora.com</a>).  </b>Growing up I was always interested in the arts,
photography specifically, but after high school I followed my family’s advice
and received a bachelor’s degree in English, from The University of
California-Irvine.  Since then, I
have been on the corporate grind. 
While I was making an “average” salary, I always felt that there was
something lacking.  That one thing
that made me excited to get up every morning and face my day, the one thing that
made it all worthwhile.  </p>
<p>A few years ago, I decided that it
was time to figure out what that “one thing” was.  I began playing with photography again and because of my love
for fashion photography, that led me to discover that makeup was my “one thing”.
</p>
<p>Since then, I have plunged head first
into the makeup and the fashion industries. I enviously flick through all of
the editorial spreads in fashion magazines, follow my makeup artist mentors on
social media, and attend industry events. I have been beautifying faces here
and there for about 2 1/2 years, but it wasn’t until the beginning of this year
that I decided to take a leap of faith and begin freelancing as a makeup artist
full-time. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Freelancing for me was a two-step
process.  Step one was enrolling in
and graduating from Los Angeles' top makeup school, so that I could refine
my technique as a makeup artist. Step two was building a SOLID portfolio (or
“book”) so that I could work on getting agency representation.  </p>
<p>I am proud to say that in May of this
year I saved up enough money, kissed the corporate world goodbye, and enrolled
in Make-up Designory’s full time Fashion Make-up Artistry Program, from which I have
recently graduated!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What’s Next?!</b></p>
<p>Step two! Now that I’ve graduated its
time to hit the ground running and start working, right? Right! But for
a freelance makeup artist starting to “build their book,  more often than not working means doing a lot of
work for free, or for “trade” rather. 
“Trade for portfolio” work is how all makeup artists, hairstylists,
wardrobe stylists, models, and photographers who want to work in the fashion or
advertising industries get started. </p>
<p>Let me back up just a bit.  I don’t want to work for MAC or become
the next YouTube beauty guru sensation. 
I am in no way disrespecting those individuals it takes A LOT to do
online tutorials and rock at the MAC boutiques, my goals are just
different.  I want my work to fill
the pages of fashion magazines, I want to be the key makeup artist for multiple
shows at New York &amp; Paris Fashion Weeks, and I want to emulate the artists
before me such as Pat McGrath, Gucci Westman, Dick Page, and Val Garland.  Trust me, those are some pretty amazing
paths to follow.. but that’s my dream! </p>
<p>So, how do I get there? I build an
amazing portfolio, doing “trade for portfolio” shoots nonstop.  This allows me to get images and to
perfect my craft.  My goal is to
spend the next 7-9 months doing just that so I can apply to be on an “Assistant
Roster” with an agency, which would get my foot in the door and could lead to representation. </p>
<p>Sounds like I have it all planned out
right?!  Well, kind of.  While I have an amazingly supportive
boyfriend and family and have saved money to live off of, I do need to
constantly replenish and build my kit to execute the looks needed for these
shoots.  And yes, some gigs do pay
an industry standard “Kit Fee,” but that sometimes is just enough to cover gas
getting to and from the location. </p>
<p>That’s where you come in!</p>
<p><b>How You Can Help</b></p>
<p>With your support, I will be able to
replenish my kit each month for the next 7-9 months (possibly even the next
year), and focus primarily on building my portfolio, without having to worry
about the stress/distractions a 9-5 job can bring.  This will expedite the process for me and get me closer to
my goal, all the much quicker!</p>
<p>It may seem quite the sum of money,
but all of the products I use add up. 
A teacher once told me, on average it is about $20 each time you use
your kit on a model.  I plan on shooting
at the <i>minimum</i> of 4 times a week,
with multiple models. Then I included all of the “Business Kit” essentials I
need to market myself, continue to educate myself, and grow as a
professional.  Here is a complete
breakdown of what I will need during that time:</p>

Hi! I’m Beth Aurora, a makeup artist & licensed esthetician from Los Angeles, California.  (Check out a preview of my portfolio in the
video above! Or check out www.bethaurora.com).  Growing up I was always interested in the arts,
photography specifically, but after high school I followed my family’s advice
and received a bachelor’s degree in English, from The University of
California-Irvine.  Since then, I
have been on the corporate grind. 
While I was making an “average” salary, I always felt that there was
something lacking.  That one thing
that made me excited to get up every morning and face my day, the one thing that
made it all worthwhile.  
A few years ago, I decided that it
was time to figure out what that “one thing” was.  I began playing with photography again and because of my love
for fashion photography, that led me to discover that makeup was my “one thing”.

Since then, I have plunged head first
into the makeup and the fashion industries. I enviously flick through all of
the editorial spreads in fashion magazines, follow my makeup artist mentors on
social media, and attend industry events. I have been beautifying faces here
and there for about 2 1/2 years, but it wasn’t until the beginning of this year
that I decided to take a leap of faith and begin freelancing as a makeup artist
full-time. 

Freelancing for me was a two-step
process.  Step one was enrolling in
and graduating from Los Angeles' top makeup school, so that I could refine
my technique as a makeup artist. Step two was building a SOLID portfolio (or
“book”) so that I could work on getting agency representation.  
I am proud to say that in May of this
year I saved up enough money, kissed the corporate world goodbye, and enrolled
in Make-up Designory’s full time Fashion Make-up Artistry Program, from which I have
recently graduated!
 
What’s Next?!
Step two! Now that I’ve graduated its
time to hit the ground running and start working, right? Right! But for
a freelance makeup artist starting to “build their book,  more often than not working means doing a lot of
work for free, or for “trade” rather. 
“Trade for portfolio” work is how all makeup artists, hairstylists,
wardrobe stylists, models, and photographers who want to work in the fashion or
advertising industries get started. 
Let me back up just a bit.  I don’t want to work for MAC or become
the next YouTube beauty guru sensation. 
I am in no way disrespecting those individuals it takes A LOT to do
online tutorials and rock at the MAC boutiques, my goals are just
different.  I want my work to fill
the pages of fashion magazines, I want to be the key makeup artist for multiple
shows at New York & Paris Fashion Weeks, and I want to emulate the artists
before me such as Pat McGrath, Gucci Westman, Dick Page, and Val Garland.  Trust me, those are some pretty amazing
paths to follow.. but that’s my dream! 
So, how do I get there? I build an
amazing portfolio, doing “trade for portfolio” shoots nonstop.  This allows me to get images and to
perfect my craft.  My goal is to
spend the next 7-9 months doing just that so I can apply to be on an “Assistant
Roster” with an agency, which would get my foot in the door and could lead to representation. 
Sounds like I have it all planned out
right?!  Well, kind of.  While I have an amazingly supportive
boyfriend and family and have saved money to live off of, I do need to
constantly replenish and build my kit to execute the looks needed for these
shoots.  And yes, some gigs do pay
an industry standard “Kit Fee,” but that sometimes is just enough to cover gas
getting to and from the location. 
That’s where you come in!
How You Can Help
With your support, I will be able to
replenish my kit each month for the next 7-9 months (possibly even the next
year), and focus primarily on building my portfolio, without having to worry
about the stress/distractions a 9-5 job can bring.  This will expedite the process for me and get me closer to
my goal, all the much quicker!
It may seem quite the sum of money,
but all of the products I use add up. 
A teacher once told me, on average it is about $20 each time you use
your kit on a model.  I plan on shooting
at the minimum of 4 times a week,
with multiple models. Then I included all of the “Business Kit” essentials I
need to market myself, continue to educate myself, and grow as a
professional.  Here is a complete
breakdown of what I will need during that time:


•  Makeup Kit Essentials
•  Airbrush compressor $400•  Airbrush foundations/concealers $200•  20 lipsticks  $300•  20 lip glosses $300•  20 lip liners $300•  6 eyeliners  $117•  32 eyeshadows (pans only) $320•  5 gel eyeliners $80•  10 blushes (pans only) $170•  16 foundations $496•  4 conceal/correct palette (light to dark) $160•  5 set powders $125•  6 mascaras $57•  50 pairs of eyelashes $50•  5 duos $35•  6 bottles of brush cleaner $180•  4 bottles of 99% $32•  3 large bottles of hand sanitizer $12•  150 powder puffs $150•  35 packs of sponges $80•  10 packs of mascara wands $50•  10 packs of precision q-tips $80•  30 packs of makeup wipes $75•  6 boxes of Kleenex  $6•  4 face washes $24•  4 moisturizers $32•  Specialty Items $500•  8 Large Z Palette 1$128•  3 Pro Z Palette $60•  “Business Kit” Essentials•  Business Cards $150.00•  Website Hosting $120.00•  Ipad $400•  Hair & Makeup Artist Network Membership $159•  The Powder Group Membership $125•  MAC PRO Workshops (Continued Education) $400•  Makeup Forever Workshops (Continued Education) $300•  Industry Trade Shows $250•  Ink & Paper $150

About JAZSALYN McNEIL

Hi I'm Jazsalyn, an emerging fashion/ textile designer. I was born and rasied in North Carolina where I currently study Textiles at North Carolina State University. My designs include a range from knits, prints and unconventional materials to reflect the ethereal energy between earth and the enchanting universe. At the age of 20 years old, I have won Belk's Southern Designer Showcase 2012 and North Carolina State University's Fashion Week 2012. Below are images of my previous award winning SPRING 2013 collection

THE PROJECT
Participating in Charleston Fashion Week will provide the opportunity to develop and grow as a designer, both creatively and through production management.  Ultimately, I am responsible  for the entire design production of 12 intricate styles for a Fall/ Winter 2013 Collection.  The sourcing, planning, budget, and creative direction, within a 2 month timeframe, is my cherished challenge!  With the support of ""indiegogo"" I can bring my creative vision to fashion moguls Fern Mallis, the creator of New York Fashion Week, CFDA Award winning fashion designer Antonio Azzuolo, and many more.  The opportunity of a lifetime is here, an opportunity that exists due to the support of heart throbe fashion lovers like you! 
 

The Funds raised will go towards:
-purchasing fabric/ yarn for print & knit designs  
-finalizing orders for embellishments and trimmings
-hiring a seamtress to help with production of garments 
-purchasing accessories and shoes for styling 
-covering travel expenses

Using technology to bring efficiencies to a process and solving problems through automation is one of our passions. Disrupting the outdoor billboard advertising business with an Internet of Things (IoT) ambient intelligent solution is an opportunity to which we have found a unique solution.
With TreasureCom Zeta
Mu, the company we are using as the vehicle for this business, we will have a unique opportunity to participate in the IoT connected advertising and
marketing space and we intend to do so with a fleet of over the road (OTR)
commercial trucks customized with Intelligent LED Screens.
TreasureCom Zeta
Mu has a strategic exclusive relationship with TIEMAC Corporation that provides
TreasureCom Zeta Mu with an advanced Microsoft Azure cloud based connected vehicle
Windows 8.1 Embedded Enterprise device installed in the trucks and with an advance telematics solution. We intend to use TreasureCom Zeta Mu to leverage this relationship and operate as
a separately and independently owned business. Our aim now is to demonstrate the process through a pilot with a fleet of 2 trucks in the USA.
   What We Need & What You Get Through an exclusive agreement with TIEMAC Corporation, we have the IoT device and Azure cloud infrastructure fully in place using Microsoft's Azure Intelligent Services System platform to underpin our solution.  
At this moment we are in the process of acquiring a small fleet of OTR commercial trucks customized with Intelligent LED Screens. We need $150,000 to get two (2) fully configured operable OTR commercial trucks on the road in the USA as proof of concept .   We need your financial support as well as your evangelism on what we are doing to disrupt the outdoor billboard advertising business through the creation of a new category of mobile IoT smart advertising billboard.  For your support we will provide you with some attractive perks in the form of FREE advertising that has value ranging from $10,000 to $300,000. You will be able to use the advertising spot for your business or resell it (for CASH) to the highest bidder of your choosing.  The funds we collect will go towards the purchase of two (2) OTR commercial tractor trailer 18 wheeler trucks each customized with a pair of IoT intelligent LED screens for the USA.

<p><b>HGC Celebrates 1 Year! </b>Last year for my birthday in October - I hosted my first ever HGC Gives Back Pop-up Shop at The Phoenix Bar &amp; Restaurant in Beverly Hills. With much support from The Phoenix and my HGC friends and family, I was able to host a <a href=""http://www.houseofgratiaetcaritas.com/blog/holiday-photo-shoot-2014/holiday-2014-photo-shoot-hgc-celebrates-the-spirit-of-ubuntu-in-style"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Holiday HGC Gives Back Pop-Up Shop in December</a> and partnered with a dear friend of mine to help collect winter accessories to hand out and to help raise funds for his Skid Row-focused charity, Moonlight Charity. </p>
<p><b>When Cancer Gets Personal</b> Growing up, my dad was the guy that encouraged me to follow my dreams. He inspired me to reach for the stars and to never settle for anything less. He taught my siblings and I about love. He encouraged us to travel, to  focus on our education, to eat weird foods, to love all kinds of music, meet new people, to love life and to be fearless. For as long as I can remember, my dad smoked cigarettes when he was stressed from working such long hours. All of my life, I know he worked incredibly hard to make a living through a restauranteur lifestyle and was the best father and husband our family could ask for. Unfortunately, somehow between the big dreams of achieving success and the harsh reality that was every day life, that strenuous lifestyle took a toll on him. In May of this year, my sister and I got the worst call of our lives - my dad who had just turned 60, had suffered from a minor stroke and through various tests, we found out he had a severely advanced stage 4 lung cancer. We packed up our bags and our apartment and drove home as soon as we could. From getting home on June 28th to help get him the attention and care he needed, there was not enough that we or the doctors could do to help stabilize his condition. In less than a month, on July 22nd, we lost the most amazing man I know, and my life will never be the same. Those three weeks were incredibly trying to say the least- but one thing is for certain- when we talked about how excited I was to grow the HGC blog, I knew he would have wanted me to continue moving forward. So as my first step into the path of social giving through House of G&amp;C, I want to make sure that the first digital pop-up campaign would be a success as long as it makes a difference. </p>

   Giving Back to Cancer Action of KC: The team from Cancer Action of Greater Kansas City were a tremendous help to myself and my family during this summer's trying time. I know that many individuals who cannot afford to cover the cost of meds would really appreciate the assistance no matter how small or big the contribution may be.   To make a difference, I'd like to use this digital pop-up initiative to raise funds to help cover 1 year's worth of meds for 6-10 individuals living with cancer.  If campaign goal is met, a minimum of $2,500 from this campaign will sent directly to Cancer Action of Greater Kansas City.  Any remaining funds will go to help contribute to the cost of a 4-person trip to the Great Wall of China for the Wong Family in 2016-2017. 
A personal email update will be send to you - to thank you for your contribution- and to let you know when the funds are sent to Cancer Action, as well as when the Wong Family takes their big trip. 






    How You Can Help: 

Look Good: Shop the online fundraiser or share the links with someone you love. 


Do Good: Shop cause-related apparel and accessories that I have featured on my www.houseofgratiaetcaritas.com blog! Read more about other HGC-approved brands. 


Give Back by sharing: If shopping or fashion isn't your thing, you can still donate directly to the campaign or help create awareness by sharing the pop-up link on Facebook, Twitter or sending to your friends who might be interested!",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><strong>what is sally chennery?</strong></h3>
<p>Well, before it was anything else, it was my name. Now it is my future, as well as my past and present. </p>
<p>After finishing my studies at the University of Creative Arts, I knew I had to take some time out of my trade to figure out what the fashion industry meant to me and what my role would be within that. With new knowledge, refined skills and a raw sense of determination, I'm finally ready. Welcome to Sally Chennery, the brand. I'm on instagram, @sallychennerybrand - there's not a huge amount there yet, but feel free to follow and become a part of the adventure.</p>
<p>I am looking for funding to help my ideas and prototypes evolve into a beautiful, accessible clothing line designed with ethical production and planet friendly practices in mind! Through academic and self study, Princes Trust courses, guidance from a wonderful business advisor and help from friends that started their own successful companies, I've collected a whole lot of knowledge. Paired with tried and tested designs, passion and drive, it's go time.</p>
<p>But times are tough, so with student debt and a low income part time job, I find myself with the time, skills and knowledge... but no funding. I guess that's where you can help. </p>
<p>Your money, every single penny, will make a huge contribution towards not just my dream, but a better future for everyone. That sounds grandiose- and yeah, you're right, it is. But it's through many small changes that big change is activated. Lets start using clothes to enrich our lives; clothes that you can wear for date night and to a day walking in the woods. Durable materials that age beautifully with you. Memories you carry around with you, that get just as messy as real life but come out of the wash as strong as ever. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>i'm starting small</strong></h3>
<p>I'm in it for a the long run, not the fun run.</p>
<p>I'm looking to raise €800. This will allow me to invest in an overlocker of my own- an essential bit of kit if you want your clothes to be hard wearing.  This magical bit of kit costs around 250- 300€ for a heavy duty model that can handle thicker fabrics such as denim and cord. As well as this, it will provide me with the funds to purchase enough fabric, hardware (like the buckles on dungarees or zips, for example) and various other resources needed to make a small first run of 4-5 carefully chosen designs. Lastly, this will fund a small amount of vintage fabrics which will be given new life as one-of-a-kind, made to order pieces. If I don't reach my goal, I will focus on first focus on purchasing my machine, then made to order pieces. I can't really comprehend this, but if I were to raise more money than I have anticipated is possible, I can put this towards really digging deeper into the possibility for change within the industry; growing my brand with the hope to one day employing people and paying them fairly for their skills and knowledge. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>i would love to offer you for your contribution;</strong></h3>
<p>€120+</p>
<p>Will secure you a pre-order for either a jumpsuit or an original vintage Japanese military inspired 6 panel sun hat. I will be in touch with you when the fundraising ends to give you ethically produced, sustainable fabric options and ask your measurements. Please allow up to 8 weeks after the end of the fundraiser for delivery.</p>
<p>€60+ </p>
<p>Your choice of my original vintage Japanese military inspired 6 panel cap with tote bag or slouch dungarees.</p>
<p>€25+</p>
<p>Hand embroidered easy fit t-shirt.</p>
<p>€15+ </p>
<p>A handy, hand made tote bag.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All contributions €5+ will receive a hand written thank you note and sticker printed on recycled paper!</p>

<h3><strong>why am i so confident i can make this work?</strong></h3>
<p>It's simple, really; I've worked really, really, <i>really </i>hard and I'm not slowing down any time soon. I've done my research, I've talked to my customer base. I have people asking me if they can buy the products I am uploading to my social media. I just need a little leg up, that's all.</p>
<p>But yes, there are risks and there will always be challenges.</p>
<p>That's why I'm starting small. I'm keeping my part time job, this means I'll always have a roof, food and health care. I'm working on my own- I won't be taking a wage at this time, all profits will go back into the business. I have training and knowledge in trend forecasting, costing and I've worked on the front line in retail stores for 13 years. I also know when to take a risk; the climate is right for pushing for a new normal in the fashion industries.  Evidence? Gucci just reduced their catwalk schedule to two shows a year from four. That's <i>half of their seasonal trends, gone.</i> Consumers, now more than ever, vote with their spending. I am voting with my money and I am listening too. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>times are tough for everyone</strong></h3>
<p>I get it- I really, really do. Please, don't feel bad if you can't contribute at all. Hey, if you've read this far I already think you're magic. But if you want to help in another way, please feel free to contact me. Words of support, sharing my page and/or this campaign- I honestly, from the bottom of my heart, can't thank you enough. </p>
<p>Lots of love,</p>
<p>Sally Chennery</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An addition;</p>
<h3><strong>what <i>exactly </i>does sustainable and ethical mean and why is Sally Chennery so fussed about it?</strong></h3>
<p>I have edited my campaign to add this section. It was brought to my attention that I haven't really gone into detail about this super important element to my brand. This was deliberate; I kind of assumed this would only reach my extended friends and family, but (amazingly!) I've reached a much larger audience. And whilst anyone that has met me has heard my rambling, passionate speeches about the towns forced to feed their children water polluted by the fabric factories upstream, not everyone has. And that's a problem now. </p>
<p>All too often we see buzz words like 'sustainable' and 'ethical' on the tags of the clothes we buy. But can it really be a true statement when this is a range of usually less than 10 pieces, in a store that sells millions of units of stock each year? It's an easy answer. Not even close. </p>
<p>I care about this because, well, I'm not really sure how I could <i>not</i>.</p>
<p>This is our future- it belongs to you, me, our loved ones, our children. Climate change is happening at a very visible rate now and time isn't on our side. At the moment, I am limited in what I can do; I hate it, but I have to accept it in order to move forward. If I don't start here, I can't start.</p>
<p>But there are fundamental choices I can make.  I am currently sourcing with fabric manufacturers and distributors based in Germany, trying to limit the amount of miles fabric must travel. I'm talking to representatives, if that doesn't work out I have a few good contacts in Portugal. I have studied green light reports, environmental impact, human impact and looked at brands that are doing exceptionally well. I have also investigated the brands doing very poorly, you would be surprised at some of the outcomes. Brands such as Lucy and Yak (check them out if you haven't already, they're really great) have resorted to opening their own factories to ensure they can produce to targets whilst championing ethical production from seed to customer. That's how difficult this can be, but it'll be so worth while. </p>
<p>I don't have that sort of scope right now. What I am doing is this; every single square inch of fabric I buy and use will come with <u>at least</u> one of the following certificates, which I will be asking for proof of before purchase. Please follow the links for a breakdown of exactly what each certificate represents;</p>
<p>GOT (Global Organic Textile Standard)</p>

<p>these are the bare minimum, there are also respected co operations that I will be looking out for. Examples include; Common Objective, Future Fashion Forward, Slow Fashion Next and Good Garment Collective.  </p>
<p>Additionally, I pledge to <strong><i>never</i></strong> stop researching, listening, reacting and learning. As new standards arise I want to be at the forefront of advances. Without sustainability, fair pay and fair working conditions for everyone involved in the process, my brand means nothing. I will try to be perfect, if I am not, I will make amends and then I will try harder. I hope to make this a successful brand. Not through immoral advertising designed to make the consumer feel bad about themselves, but because my customers know I do what I say I will, my clothes are comfortable and dynamic and that I care about building a good future for all of us.</p>

We've added a number of new features,including our 360° Air Cushion, for a shoe you can dance, jump, and runfor the bus in. 


We find your perfect fit:

No two feet, even your own left and right, are exactly the same.Just take one photo of each foot, and our image analysis technology doesthe rest. Never worry about ordering the wrong size or dealing withthe hassle of returns again.
 
 


 

We make shoes for living:
 Uncomfortable shoes hold us back - we can’t quite walk as fast, stand as long,or do the things we want to do. Inspired by the technical insoles in sneakers,we create shoes that are comfortable and functional, ones that enableall women to live fully. 
 

 

We curate timeless styles:  
We believe in buying less and buying better. We're about curating classicstyles that make dressing for all occasions effortless.We're starting with the Perfect Pump, a timeless staple with a sleek,pin-straight heel.  Available in Black, Blush, Chestnut, and Cream.
 
 

 
 
We are rooted in Korean design and craftmanship:
 
Our shoes are handmade by artisans in Seongsu-dong, a neighborhood inSeoul with a rich heritage of shoemaking. Our artisans have honed their craftover decades. Our manufacturer is a 2nd generation shoemaker with whomwe collaborated for our patent-pending 360° Air Cushion constructionand technical insole. 





 
Our story begins with the frustration of never being able to find shoes thatsit at the intersection of comfort, fit, and style. Something was always wrong- it was the right length but the wrong width, it fit our left foot but was a little loosefor the right foot, it gave us blisters or hurt if we walked all day in it…the list goes on. And if we were lucky enough to find THE ONE, it would beimpossible to replace after selling out.  
We learned that we weren't the only ones. 87% of women suffer fromuncomfortable shoes and that 76% of people don't fit into ""standard"" shoe sizes.Beyond blisters and sore calf muscles, the long-term health consequencescan be serious: bunions, foot deformities and back pain. We all have enoughgoing on in our lives - our shoes don't need to be creating problems for us.
 

 
Rooted in the Korean word ‘가다’ (kada), which means ‘to go’, we make shoes(‘kudu’)for going places. Shoes that take you from the boardroom to the bar,ones that you can jump, dance, and run for the bus in. Best of all, we make shoeshopping effortless: one virtual fitting from the comfort of your phone and a lifetimeof getting the perfect fit, every time, in every style.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hi, I’m Sam. I’m the founder of Ally. Ally Shoes was started in response to an accident I had.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>It started on a hike.</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530742509/psgljbkdjhemwgnw5il9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I’m an avid hiker. That’s why I went on a 7-day trek in Africa. It was great. I reached the summit and had an amazing time. But on the way down I injured my toes. It was bad.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It took half a year until I could start wearing closed-toe shoes. Also, heels were no longer an option. But I wasn't ready to give up. One question kept popping up in my head:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Why do heels HAVE to hurt?</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">That thought led to hours of extensive research with shoe experts around the world, including these two amazing women that helped me start ALLY together.</p>

<p>When we first started Ally shoes, we thought we were just making comfortable heels. But over the course of the journey, we found out it's so much more than that. </p>
<p><strong><i>The Ally Circle</i></strong> was initially formed as we were still developing samples for our first collection. We brought in friends who were fed up just as we were to chat about shoes, try on the samples, and give us feedback after wearing our product.</p>

</div></div>","Ally Shoes makes the 1st high-performance heels that look as good as they feel. 
Are you fed up with the narrow definition of what ""nude"" means?
Meet Ally - the world's most comfortable line of inclusive nude pumps.
Ally comes in 5 shades, 2 fabrics, 16 sizes and 3 widths, so you can pick the color, size, and feel that makes you look and feel your best*.
*Note: Indiegogo only allows us to list 10 sizing options, so please pick the closest size when you check out. We'll follow up to get your accurate size (US 5-12 / EU 35-44, incl. half sizes)  and width (narrow, medium, wide)*




""The NYC-based all-female team combines elegance with science to create heels that feel like 'pillows under your feet'.” - Vanity Fair
""Beauty meets functionality."" - Croissant
""Ally is where comfort meets science and technology."" - Inside Beauty

1. Comfort Our adaptable leather and the insole system are designed to provide the comfort you deserve.
2. QualityEvery pair of Ally heels is handcrafted by experienced shoemakers in the bespoke fashion district in Shanghai.
3. FitAll of our heels comes in 16 sizes (half size available) and 3 different widths.

Hear what real women, who spend all week strapped into the heels from our first collection""The Little Black Heels"", have to say.


Don't take our word for it. Ask Our Customers!




We use our patent-pending product design to provide the comfort you deserve. Our heels are made with new high-quality full grain adaptable leather; they include an ergonomic insole system, and your new favorite heels are built according to the highest quality craftsmanship available on the market.

Designed in NYC, Hand-made in Shanghai
Our heels are handcrafted by the best shoemakers in Shanghai's bespoke fashion district. Every pair of Ally heels is hand built, hand stitched, and hand finished with high quality leather specially-processed for sketchiness and adaptability.

If you look carefully, you'll find a discrete signature by our craftsman (or craftswoman) on the inside of every pair of heels, so you know the actual name of the person who built your heels.

 
""Every Step Counts""


To ensure your heels have the perfect fit from the first wear, we made it a point to offer half sizes and three different widths. Find your perfect fit, width, and size using a ‘smart fitting’ algorithm designed by Dr. Clarke and sent to you after purchasing.





What is “nude” for you?
The answer is different for everyone. Even among the Ally team -  a group of women of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds-we all have different answers.
That is why we decided to build something you don’t have to compromise on and created heels with five shades of nude colors.The Nude Collection comes in 5 shade and 2 fabrics; leather and suede.Our heels also come in 16 sizes and 3 fits; narrow, normal and wide. 

 
Timeline
 

 


Hi, I’m Sam. I’m the founder of Ally. Ally Shoes was started in response to an accident I had.
It started on a hike.

I’m an avid hiker. That’s why I went on a 7-day trek in Africa. It was great. I reached the summit and had an amazing time. But on the way down I injured my toes. It was bad.
It took half a year until I could start wearing closed-toe shoes. Also, heels were no longer an option. But I wasn't ready to give up. One question kept popping up in my head:
Why do heels HAVE to hurt?
That thought led to hours of extensive research with shoe experts around the world, including these two amazing women that helped me start ALLY together.


Ally is a women-founded team determined to build your staple high-performance heels with colors of nude for women with non-traditional skin tones.

 


Included with your order - A beautiful home as comfortable as your perfect heels
 
Our chic dust bags were designed to both protect your shoes from getting damaged, whether they are in your closet, suitcase, or gym bag, and look great!
Imagine how you’ll feel when unwrapping your favorite heels every time you wear them. It’s like giving yourself a gift over and over every time you slide into your favorite pair of heels!

An exclusive community of strong, independent women 
When we first started Ally shoes, we thought we were just making comfortable heels. But over the course of the journey, we found out it's so much more than that. 
The Ally Circle was initially formed as we were still developing samples for our first collection. We brought in friends who were fed up just as we were to chat about shoes, try on the samples, and give us feedback after wearing our product.
This little community of early adopters and testers has now grown into a tight and strong community of women in NYC and around the world.
As an Ally Circle member, you won’t just receive discounts and early access to new collections, you’ll also have a forum to celebrate your wins, discuss challenges, and talk about hot topics that matter to you.

</div></div>","The OSO Orbit chronograph is now available for purchase at osowatch.co. Receive your watch as early 3-5 days. The Orbit collection, also our maiden release, seeks to pave the way much like how our forefathers first ventured into space. Unraveling a world of timelessness and infinite possibilities that are still being explored today.Inspired by the human spirit that never settles for mediocrity, OSO Orbit was created for those with the same desire for discovery and drive for innovation.*All OSO Orbit watch comes with a default leather strap + a FREE matching NATO strap. The leather strap and NATO strap will still be included if you add-on the steel bracelet.All 6 colorways will be available. Every OSO Orbit watch comes with the default leather strap, a matching NATO strap, and a spring bar tool.Straying from modernity, the OSO Orbit collection maintains a tonneau shape, reminiscent of vintage chronograph watches from the early 70’s. The 70’s was a milestone for bold and experimental watch designs. OSO Orbit is a modern reimagining of vintage chronographs. The symmetry of the dials brings a clean, contemporary look to the watch. The curve lines of the rounded corners and dome-shaped Sapphire glass maintain its vintage integrity. Paired with genuine leather straps tie the look together, giving the watch an antique feel.The case is inspired by Astron, the first ever quartz watch introduced by Seiko on December 25, 1969 which revolutionized the watch industry.  We have designed it to give it a modern touch with linear brushing throughout the case, along with a high-quality marine grade stainless steel (316L) case typically found on high-end dive watches.Both the silver and gold case designs have elegantly slim profiles, with an ideal thickness of 12 millimeters. Despite the thin profile however, the weight of OSO watches still conveys a feeling of quality on the wrist.Seconds can feel like minutes, while minutes can feel like hours. With OSO’s hybrid chronograph movement, experience a sense of timelessness unlike any other. Powered by the famed VK64 Meca-Quartz from Seiko, also known as the “hybrid movement”, integrates quartz engineering with mechanical movement. Instead of the intrusive sweeping back motion typical of a standard quartz chronograph, the Orbit's chronograph hands are disengaged from the quartz motor and snap back to zero instantaneously upon reset. The result – a piece of time-keeping marvel that sits on the wrists of a discerning few. One that perfectly pairs the accuracy of quartz with the distinct aesthetics of a mechanical chronograph.The hand snaps back to zero just like a mechanical watchBring your OSO Orbit on adventures. It boasts an impressive water resistance of 100m and marine grade stainless steel (316L) case that is corrosion resistant. Topped off with high-quality Sapphire glass that is resistant to scratches, allowing you to transition between worlds unhindered. Each caseback of the Orbit collection is engraved with an elegant design of our solar system overlooking a mountain. A fitting tribute to mankind’s past success as well as a timely reminder of what we can achieve. There is much left to be explored, but none that can’t be attained with innovation. OSO Orbit uses Super-LumiNova C3 made in Switzerland. It is applied to all 11 metal indexes and the hands resulting in a well-balanced dial for maximum clarity in both daytime and nighttime. When light transmits across a boundary from one material to another, a change in speed causes a change in direction of the light wave. This results in an optical phenomenon called a mirage. Perhaps aptly named, as the Mirage looks uncannily familiar yet distant. A distinct 1940s deep forest green dial carries an air of sophistication, while the surrounding gold case brings an old-fashioned olive shade into the modern world. Culminating in a classic combination of gold and green that is reminiscent of that worn in yesteryears. For when you feel like an old soul. The emerald glow was illuminated by powerful ultraviolet radiation from supermassive black holes, allowing the Hubble to pick it up. At the core of the two galaxies were two black holes, although it is unknown whether they circled each other or even collided after the merger. Abyss is inarguably the most modern of the OSO Orbit collection. Black and white are subtle, yet the contrast is exuberant. Unlike Mirage and Quasar, Abyss is plated with polished stainless steel for a cool, sporty look.Complete with a genuine black leather strap, Abyss brings out the beauty in anything, on any occasion. You can be understated and still make a statement. For when you need the perfect blank canvas.High energy cores called quasars destroy galaxies to make way for new ones. Many quasars appear red through clouds of dust and gas, but they actually carry a bluish tint. In the Orbit collection, Quasar is a bespoke mix of dark cerulean and cyan. Much like the original quasars in space, this mesmerizing shade is made to break boundaries and bring a whole new dimension to your look. The retro blue tone and yellow hour and minute hands on Quasar are a refreshing break from deeper colors, revealing a glimpse of your unique personality on your wrist. The gold case ties the watch together, keeping it grounded in timelessness.For when you just want to be yourself.   The mecha-quartz movement allows the chronograph hand to tick five times per second and when reset, it snaps back to zero just like a mechanical watch. Watch it in action:How to set the date and time on the Orbit. Watch the Quasar in action:

</span></div> </div>","Foldee Disc™, endless fun that you can take with you wherever you go.Behind the simplistic design of Foldee disc™ were numerable tests of aerodynamics with various material compositions as we searched for the perfect balance in materials, disc diameters for optimal performance and optimal weight.
Catching: Foldee™ is flexible on all axis, making catching more intuitive and easy. During the discs flight you can adjust your catching position, however you feel like making the catch. With zero hard edges the disc is very easy to catch.



Safety: Due to its soft material, Foldee™ looses its shape, speed & rotation on impact. Foldee™ absorbs the impact and disperses the energy throughout the disc, limiting any potential injury.




Movement and exercise: Foldee™ is a recreational product that promotes a fun, healthy activity that helps to engage numerous muscle groups, strengthening your core and improving your balance.

Flying distance: Foldee™ optimal distance is between 1m – 30m for novice and intermediate users. Experienced users can reach longer distance without losing shape and form through the flight.


Foldee Disc™ is a flying object, so it's important to think about visibility. We chose four vibrant color options to allow the players easier visual location for tracking when playing Foldee games. Their distinctive colours make Foldee™ recognizable when at the park, beach or wherever you play.With your help and support we can bring Foldee™ to the World!",14.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Andrea Huff and with my fiancé Anton Strickland, we are starting our own clothing line called <span>Pursuit Dreamz Streetwear</span>. This idea didn't start out as an idea of my own, but of Anton's. He has always wanted to help people yet he also wanted to one day own a business- this is our way of bridging those two dreams together. Yet with that said, the ultimate goal of Pursuit Dreamz is not to just fulfill our personal dreams, but to help others achieve theirs along the way. We plan on donating a percentage of <span>all</span> of our profits to different non-profit organizations as well as starting a fund to sponsor people in the music and dance industry. </p>
<p>We actually started this business over the summer but we failed to plan for a long term. Our shirts sold great and we find a great niche to sell to, but we didn't anticipate the financial strain it would put on us personally. So this time around we're reaching out for help. To successfully re-launch Pursuit Dreamz we would need about $3000. Most of that, about $2000 will go to the designing and production of our shirts- five different designs to be exact. The rest of the money will be put towards upgrading and maintenance of our website and various social media outlets. Because we are online based, our site is basically the face of our business and we want it to look the best and also, be the easiest to navigate for our customers. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><span>The Impact</span></h2>
<p>We want to do our best to help change the world and the lives of individuals and we need your help to do that. By helping us start our business, you'll be enabling us to not only spread awesome through shirts but to also make an impact through the organizations we'll be partnered with. That is one of the core goals of Pursuit Dreamz. We don't want to be focused only on our sales or how many new products we can create, but on how well we treat our customers and change someone's life. </p>
<h2><span>Other Ways You Can Help</span></h2>
<p>We understand that some simply cannot contribute money but that doesn't mean anything. Spreading the word about us and our campaign is probably the best help we could ask for. Even if we do successfully launch our business, it would be nothing without you- the people who buy our products. So don't forget to share on Facebook, Twitter, and all the other Indie GoGo tools about us, Pursuit Dreamz. </p>
<p>And finally, thank you. </p></div>","Hey all!

We have known that for a long time, but we also know that the big brands are not only sell their products, they also sell their advertises and services. What make the big brands products become so expensise? They need to make expensive advertising and grow service centers so fast. But the new comers, set up a high quality products at super affordable price for one reason, popularity. They need to change people perceptions about the greatness of the products itself, not by how it will do after sale service. Because every high quality products actually can maintain its quality more than a year or two. Yes, almost every flagship products is really good at their first year while under their guarantee cards. That means, almost all flagship devices never use their guarantee cards, funny fact.</p><p>So we known that big brands have good advertising and services while new comers have attractive prices and products.</p><blockquote>As a new comer, we've learned a lot from OnePlus and Xiaomi. We've also learned a lot from the big brands on how they maintain their customers. We've made a solid team to birth a great smartphone at a great price.

The SSRT is a tile, but a smart tile, made of high quality carbon and plexiglass materials, which are controlled from the mobile

It's a tile that will transfer solar energy into electrical
energy. From the app on your phone you will be able to control the color of the

a  problem. With only one click on your
app you will start the heaters in the tile and the snow will melt in seconds so
you won't have to clean it.  Isn't that great? In the Press:       
The heaters are small like the ones in your car, and they
will be placed on a see through part of the tile.
Every tile has a sensor inside itself and when it snows on your roof you will
receive a notification on your APP.  When
you open it you will receive a question whether you want to remove the snow or
not, and with a simple touch on the "" Clean UP "" button the snow will melt. 
While others are out cleaning snow from their rooftops, you will enjoy your
free time with your loved ones.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 How does the SSRT work and what's it made of?



A decent size surface of the SSRT allows 8 solar cells to
take place on it without any problems.

When we connect 8 cells you will get 8 watts of power per tile.

The SSRT is built out of two layers of material. The first
layer is made of carbon where we place 8 solar cells, and on that layer a
see-through layer of plexiglass is placed as well.




The plexiglass allows light to come into the cells and
produce electrical energy.
Other than the two layers we have connectors which will
connect one tile to another.
With the use of connectors we don't  need wires which are already built into the
tile, it's enough to connect the SSRT to the next one with the help of another
one (And that's it).

 
Isn't
that cool?
               When we have another type of light, the solar tile will
produce electrical energy. The capacity of produced electrical energy is
depending on the intensity of the daylight as well as nightlight.
An average house spends about 18 kW/h of electrical energy
and in case if you produce more than 18 kW/h 
you will be able to sell the unnecessary part of electrical energy and
make money.
With the use of ecologically accepted consumers, like LED
lighting, you will be able to reduce the usage of electrical energy. With this
type of production and consumption of electrical energy you will be able not just to save but also to sell electrical energy to profit.

We wanted to build a tile that will be special, unique, and for all those that are having second thoughts about using the SSRT -no need to hesitate, because now we will tell you even more about its advantages, possibilities and quality.
If you get your whole roof covered with the SSRT, you will be able to change its color.
Also, by using the SSRT you won't have to pay high electricity bills.

<p>2-in-1 reversible bomber jackets jackets for men, plus a unisex style for
both men and women. A sophisticated formal jacket on one side, that can be
flipped to expose a casual and contemporary side. <br/></p><p><b>Mix of cotton twill or double sided high condensed jersey with crease resistant finish and high quality polyester neoprene that doesn't wrinkle </b>creates a innovative but still classic style for you. <br/></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465849283/SECOND_IMAGE_ifxt6g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Concept</h3><p></p><p>We designed the reversible bomber jacket concept keeping in mind that most men don’t particularly spend as much time as women in the dressing room. Men take function very seriously, and like their style to be effortless. Our customers have spoken, and now it's time to deliver. With WHICHKIM’s 2-in-1 reversible bomber jackets you can have the style of a dedicated fashionisto, and the ease of changing in a matter of seconds.<br/></p><p>WHICHKIM will be offering an array of options for the
jackets, for a truly one-of-a-kind wardrobe piece. Our future goal is to give you a wider selection of designs to choose from for a special custom jacket. This collection will be using highly functional fabrics such as crease resistant cotton and polyester blend, light weight polyester neoprene with abstract prints, and double sided knits. You will be perfectly ready for a chic and stylish Fall/Winter 2016 season. To begin with, we want to offer you the following options for your very own W Bomber Jacket:</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2></h2><h3>Fabrication</h3><p>We take fabrication very seriously. Yes, style and details are important of course but for men, function is the key. Keeping it is a double sided jacket in mind, we focused on minimizing having wrinkles on this jackets so flipping inside and out can be easier for customers but still keeping the price reasonable. We came up with cotton twill fabric that has crease resistant finish for one side which will bring formal look to the style, and highly condensed double sided jersey with less stretch with maximum durability and light weight polyester neoprene for the other side to keep the weight light but also to reduce the crease. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467916846/Fabrication_s0eg3i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>

Reversible Bomber Jackets 
Made for your choice!

 
2-in-1 reversible bomber jackets jackets for men, plus a unisex style for
both men and women. A sophisticated formal jacket on one side, that can be
flipped to expose a casual and contemporary side. Mix of cotton twill or double sided high condensed jersey with crease resistant finish and high quality polyester neoprene that doesn't wrinkle creates a innovative but still classic style for you. ConceptWe designed the reversible bomber jacket concept keeping in mind that most men don’t particularly spend as much time as women in the dressing room. Men take function very seriously, and like their style to be effortless. Our customers have spoken, and now it's time to deliver. With WHICHKIM’s 2-in-1 reversible bomber jackets you can have the style of a dedicated fashionisto, and the ease of changing in a matter of seconds.WHICHKIM will be offering an array of options for the
jackets, for a truly one-of-a-kind wardrobe piece. Our future goal is to give you a wider selection of designs to choose from for a special custom jacket. This collection will be using highly functional fabrics such as crease resistant cotton and polyester blend, light weight polyester neoprene with abstract prints, and double sided knits. You will be perfectly ready for a chic and stylish Fall/Winter 2016 season. To begin with, we want to offer you the following options for your very own W Bomber Jacket:FabricationWe take fabrication very seriously. Yes, style and details are important of course but for men, function is the key. Keeping it is a double sided jacket in mind, we focused on minimizing having wrinkles on this jackets so flipping inside and out can be easier for customers but still keeping the price reasonable. We came up with cotton twill fabric that has crease resistant finish for one side which will bring formal look to the style, and highly condensed double sided jersey with less stretch with maximum durability and light weight polyester neoprene for the other side to keep the weight light but also to reduce the crease. 

Fit - 4 different fits to choose from, each with their own unique design
Tailored Fit (slim fit with regular sleeves)
Basic Fit (slightly tapered fit with raglan sleeves)

Urban Fit (oversized fit with dropped shoulders)
Parachute Fit (a unisex loose fit with raglan sleeves and adjustable string hem)

<h3>Thanking You In Advance.</h3>
<p>Hi !  I'm Babs and Gingham Doll is my baby. I am an independent ladies-wear fashion designer based in London, UK with over 10 years experience in dressing and designing for all shapes and sizes. I started Gingham Doll because I wanted to offer women an interactive and personal fashionable experience and the ability to customise their Gingham Doll purchase. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Last summer I acquired my very first ever boutique in the heart of London's trendy east-end, Brick Lane. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">After giving up all my other means of income, I went into Gingham Doll full-time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I love working in my boutique. Meeting women from all over the globe and feel there nothing is better than the one-on-one experience I offer and gain from my customers. Women come in all shapes and sizes so I get to work closely with my customers, and allow them to customise designs to suit their proportions.</span></p>
<p>In order for my business to grow and thrive I need your help.</p>
<p>Currently I design and make everything myself and  am at risk from having to close the boutique as i am unable to run it while keeping up with orders, admin, marketing and everything else it takes to keep a successful business running. I am literally a one-man-band. Your contributions would allow me to hire help, build a team and keep the boutique running in order for me to take the business to the next level by seeking assistance with marketing and hopefully sponsorship. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>I am seeking to raise £6500. This money will go towards hiring machinists and pattern cutters to assist with meeting demands. It would also mean that i would be able to keep the boutique running and possibly hire some in-store assistance. I want to build a team to take Gingham Doll to the next level.</li>
<li>I will be seeking assistance with marketing and branding professionals whilst looking for potential sponsorship.</li>
<li><p>Each contributor will receive special perks such as exclusive VIP gift/discount cards which would allow them to purchase pieces for themselves or as gifts for their loved ones. Full details can also by found on my website <a href=""http://www.ginghamdoll.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ginghamdoll.com</a></p></li>
<li><p>I will be posting follow-up videos with testimonies and interviews with clients about their Gingham Doll experience as well notifying contributors about how the money will be distributed whether I make my target or not. Every penny will go into the development of my business  and furthering of the brand. </p></li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<h3> Impact</h3>
<ul>

</div></div>","Thanking You In Advance.
Hi !  I'm Babs and Gingham Doll is my baby. I am an independent ladies-wear fashion designer based in London, UK with over 10 years experience in dressing and designing for all shapes and sizes. I started Gingham Doll because I wanted to offer women an interactive and personal fashionable experience and the ability to customise their Gingham Doll purchase. 
Last summer I acquired my very first ever boutique in the heart of London's trendy east-end, Brick Lane. 
After giving up all my other means of income, I went into Gingham Doll full-time.
I love working in my boutique. Meeting women from all over the globe and feel there nothing is better than the one-on-one experience I offer and gain from my customers. Women come in all shapes and sizes so I get to work closely with my customers, and allow them to customise designs to suit their proportions.
In order for my business to grow and thrive I need your help.
Currently I design and make everything myself and  am at risk from having to close the boutique as i am unable to run it while keeping up with orders, admin, marketing and everything else it takes to keep a successful business running. I am literally a one-man-band. Your contributions would allow me to hire help, build a team and keep the boutique running in order for me to take the business to the next level by seeking assistance with marketing and hopefully sponsorship. 
 
What I Need & What You Get


I am seeking to raise £6500. This money will go towards hiring machinists and pattern cutters to assist with meeting demands. It would also mean that i would be able to keep the boutique running and possibly hire some in-store assistance. I want to build a team to take Gingham Doll to the next level.
I will be seeking assistance with marketing and branding professionals whilst looking for potential sponsorship.
Each contributor will receive special perks such as exclusive VIP gift/discount cards which would allow them to purchase pieces for themselves or as gifts for their loved ones. Full details can also by found on my website http://www.ginghamdoll.com
I will be posting follow-up videos with testimonies and interviews with clients about their Gingham Doll experience as well notifying contributors about how the money will be distributed whether I make my target or not. Every penny will go into the development of my business  and furthering of the brand. 



 Impact

As production costs overseas continues to be competitive, fashion has in turn become disposable, therefore most fashion houses have turned to producing abroad, creating cheaper, lower quality, seasonal fashion. As long as the demand is high for cheap easy pieces, fashion houses will continue to have their clothes made abroad, sometimes in unethical factories. Thats where I come in. I feel there is a gap in the market for ladies who still want the option of owning great timeless pieces, made in the UK with quality fabrics and cut in classic silhouettes, whilst offering competitive prices.  
I have had the pleasure of working with some high profile entertainers and providing them with tailor-made pieces for several red carpets and TV appearances . These include actress Anika Noni Rose (Dreamgirls, Disney's Princess and the Frog), Miquita Oliver (Presenter, Channel 4, BBC Radio 1Xtra), Andrea Oliver (Presenter/Broadcaster BBC), Mel B (Spice Girls) and Kele Le Roc (Mobo award winning artist).

It would be devastating for me to have to give up my boutique seeing as its still in its infancy. This is a crucial time for me when i need to be developing a client base, marketing and promoting my brand in order for it to be a thriving and profitable business.

We believe the future lies in businesses that let go of the maximum profit concept, yet are healthy enterprises whose fundament is to use the biggest amount of their return to give back to society.
Wear real meaning and quality instead of only marketing!

Who we are

We are three friends and former colleagues who used to work in the fashion industry for many years as product managers, buyers and designers: Pinar (35) and Wolfgang (31) from Berlin, Germany and Joan (29) from Barcelona, Spain. Two of us (Pinar and Wolf) have quit their jobs to fully dedicate all of our time and energy to this project.



Our past
Working in fashion, we witnessed how just about every common international major brand stands for nothing anymore except for maximized profits: producing mostly in mediocre quality and exploiting cheapest labor cost in third world countries, realizing high margins and prices through massive investments in marketing only, sugarcoating something that is usually not worth the price.
As it turned out, there was no affordable brand we were able to identify ourselves with anymore. 
In general, we all felt we wanted to make a difference with our knowledge and abilities and chose to work and live with more meaning - and use a big chunk of our margin to create real human value.

The Impact
Instead of talking about how things should change, we want to become active and actually work on making this world fairer while not abandoning the idea of creating a healthy business that offers products that are aesthetic and appealing.
We are using our background and the things we know how to do best (fashion products) and offer you underwear that is of better quality and stands for something real. 
We believe we need new approaches to how we live and do business to be able to call ourselves the generation of the 21st century. Therefore, our objective is not to get rich, but to dedicate ourselves to the fun we have creating a great product and the happiness we get out of actively making this world a better place. 
If we do manage to come up with 50.000 USD and kickstart this adventure, it will be proof that a collective of people from around the world connected through social media has the power to transform any field of business into something more meaningful - and breathe life into the idea of people uniting more and more around the world for the better.

What We Need & What You Get

So far we have developed the mens underwear line (and have about 15 pieces that we used for our photo shoot).

In addition to what we will be donating, once we start selling our products, we will continuously donate money to the orphanage to sustain and expand it. 
Right after the campaign ends on Jan 31st, we will fly over to Cambodia and submit the money to the orphanage. 


Transparency: As being transparent about how we use the money that we raise here on indiegogo is extremely important to us, we will publish exact proof of how 50% of the raised amount will be spent in Cambodia in February once this campaign is over. And everyone who feels like coming along with us is more than welcome to do so!

<p>This was our second Kickstarter project, our first project the AERO Ti Chopsticks. Both were successfully funded and we’re back to provide the opportunity for anyone who wants to pre-order the Titan before it's available for retail sale.</p>
<p>We started out as Eighty Eight Industry and we are now called LIOE Design because we want to feature our designer John Lioe. We’re still the same folks, we still believe in making products that stand out and hopefully makes people say ""I never thought something can look like that"", good or bad (preferably good).</p>
<p>This project started when we went in search for a cool business card holder because we were tired of our business cards getting wrinkled and messed up in our wallets. Well, that’s where we ran into trouble. We started with the usual internet search hoping to find a good solution, except all we found were card holders that all looked the same. The usual clam shell shaped holder. So, we decided to make our own, why not? It seemed like business card holders could use some cool variations and options for people to choose from. Because we wanted not only a simple minimalist solution but one that was unique and easy on the eyes. The Titan Card Holder is aero-inspired combined with being minimalist, light-weight, and attractive.</p>

<p>This card holder went thought many ideations before we decided on the functionality and look of the holder. Titan can be opened with two hands or even just one hand. We wanted the card holder to have a simple mechanism that could help it open and close reliability without the use of hinges, so we decided to use magnets to close the two main moving parts together.</p>

<p>The pattern on the front of the card holder is reminisce of a futuristic space door and inspired by the nose of the B29 Super Fortress. Titan has a dark gunmetal gray color to give the holder a completely different look and feel than other card holders. Titan is made from aircraft grade 6061-T6 Aluminum and the surface is bead blasted then anodized for a gunmetal finish. Titan can hold 9 standard business card or 2 credit card plus one ID if you choose to use it as a minimalist wallet. It is RFID blocking as well.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Hello</u></h3>
<p>While attending eight years of private school throughout my childhood it was important to follow dress codes and make sure I had a collared shirt on at all times. As I got older in my high school career, I started to realize there was an issue that was most affecting most of my classmates. It was hard for them to find quality button-down shirts that would cost them under $100. Even if they were able to buy these pricey shirts or if their parents provided them, my classmates would still complain about the style or that the quality isn't up to standard for what they are looking for. I took a notice to this reoccurring issue and decided that I would make it my goal to create a shirt. That shirt would bring together all the aspects of the perfect button-down that could be worn in all features of someone's life. Oh, and it will never cost you more than $100. We want you to save that extra money that would have been spent on a more expensive shirt and put towards something that will make you happy!</p>

Hello
While attending eight years of private school throughout my childhood it was important to follow dress codes and make sure I had a collared shirt on at all times. As I got older in my high school career, I started to realize there was an issue that was most affecting most of my classmates. It was hard for them to find quality button-down shirts that would cost them under $100. Even if they were able to buy these pricey shirts or if their parents provided them, my classmates would still complain about the style or that the quality isn't up to standard for what they are looking for. I took a notice to this reoccurring issue and decided that I would make it my goal to create a shirt. That shirt would bring together all the aspects of the perfect button-down that could be worn in all features of someone's life. Oh, and it will never cost you more than $100. We want you to save that extra money that would have been spent on a more expensive shirt and put towards something that will make you happy!

<br/><h3><span>ME=M1LF</span></h3>
<p><span><span>I am Paris Kouns, 22, single mother to Palace Crowley and a full-time vintage curator and stylist at ACTUALTEEN. I have designed a collection of men and women's clothing for Fall/Winter 2014. I have a sarcastic relationship with the word “MILF” being a young mother. It started out as a joke when my daughter was born, but I started to identify with it more through my baby-raising days as my life grew more “kid-friendly”. When you are constantly asking “why is that wet!?” or “it’s not that much throw up,” you feel like anything but a MILF.</span><br/></span></p>
<h3>WHAT IS M1LF</h3>The clothes are heavily inspired by play, mixed with my endless obsession with internet culture. I design all of my textiles. The theme is ""more is more."" Layers on top of prints, on top of filters, etc. Much like my personal life: As a vintage buyer I spend half my time in thrift stores, currently enrolled in a  ""remote viewing"" and  ""psychic experiences"" group, and I wake up everyday to a toddler who is jumping on me and and giving me her ""milk lady"" eyes. The contrast of all the different lives I lead is what created this line.  All pieces and most textiles will be made in the US and made by me. A website of my work will be launched February 2014. Items will be sold online and in select stores in various countries. I have a list of stylists and curators that I plan to work with  starting early January.<p><br/></p>
<h3>WHAT M1LF NEEDS</h3>
<p>I am starting from scratch, and when I say scratch I mean it. I don't have the connections or the money of other designers to outsource and mass-produce fabrics and clothing. I have designed 4-6 textiles that will be produced in the US. All of the clothing and patterns will be made by me. To make it simple, here is an outline of my budget: </p>
<p>Travel/People Total: $260.00 (website, plane ticket to NY for consults)</p>
<p>Photography Shoot Total: $220.00 (models, photographer, hair and makeup, accessories and shoes on loan)</p>
<p>Materials Total: $240.00 (business cards, thread and new serger sewing machine)</p>
<p>Sewing Patterns: Total: $76.00</p>
<p>Fabric and Accessories Cost: Total: $1626.00</p>
<p>I have allotted a 9% increase in my actual budget, so after I have paid the indiegogo fees I will still be on track to have all the necessary money to finish my project!</p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal, the money I did make will be used to create as many as the items as I can after everything else in the budget is paid for. For example, a few of my pieces are the same style top but different textiles. Only one of them would be made with the option to produce in the other textiles. </p>

<h3>HEY, THANKS</h3></span><p></p>
<p><span>For the people who let rationalizations and self-doubt get the better of you,  this whole project came to fruition by the practice of putting the stresses of everyday life, money and success aside to create a truly raw collection of textiles and clothing. I have finally stopped letting ""you can't"" stop me. By supporting me in this process, you will simply be condoning the free-flow of creativity unaltered by rationalizations. And from your support, you will help me in my next steps of furthering my career in the fashion industry and as a role model for my daughter.</span><br/></p>

</b></div>","What does the company do?
We create extra durable t-shirts, fleece hoodies and accessories that last longer than others.  For every garment we make, focus on high quality--quality of detail (extra stitching at seams to prevent rolling, heavy-duty zippers, ring-spun yarn for a smoother, longer-lasting thread that wont pill.) quality craftsmanship (our t-shirt fabric is made from us in our 100-year-old family-owned plant North Carolina guaranteeing, your purchase supports US workers who meticulously inspect every garment.) quality of sustainable materials (made from sorted, processed and re-purposed materials, saving water and energy while reducing harmful toxins and chemicals.)
What sustainability means to us.By using recycled materials in our apparel, we can start to reduce the dependency on resources that will continue to burden future generations, including shortages of water, energy, and time while freeing our landfills, oceans and air with pollutants.We ask you to lead a conscious life.When you support us, you are making a conscious choice to actually think about why you are buying the clothes you wear.  Once you wear our apparel, we are pretty sure you will feel great (and look even better) about your purchase knowing you are buying one of the highest-quality and most durable garments available while investing in a cleaner world for future generations.  For our part, we will donate 3% of sales to the Textile Exchange. For the past 10 years, the Textile Exchange has been dedicated to pioneering meaningful change within the apparel and textile industry. We admire their independent spirit and passionate belief in a sustainable future. 
 With the money raised we will...
Increase production and employ more people--this makes us feel good, knowing that we are directly contributing to our economy, with what matters most... people.  Additionally, the more who contribute, the more awareness we raise about living a conscious, sustainable life--helping to create a better future for all of us.
Ethics.  We have them. We work only with responsible partners, located as close as possible to us who support our vision, thereby making it easier for us to assure transparency and reduce carbon footprint.



Share our vision.If you love our mission, tell your friends on Facebook and to anyone else you think would be interested.  And of course, use the Indiegogo social tools. That's it.Thanks! High-Quality.  It matters.

<h1>The Story</h1>
<p>Some months ago two Instagram-addict friends <a href=""http://followgram.me/giariv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Gianpiero</strong></a> and <a href=""http://followgram.me/mkmrz8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Michele</strong></a> were discussing on how much it would have been great to have jewels with Instagram pictures printed on them. In fact, they thought, there is a famous citation that says <em>""Diamonds are forever""</em>... <em>""but pictures too!"" </em>they said.</p>
<p><strong>JewelGram</strong> comes from this: <strong>it turns your Instagram pictures into jewels.</strong></p>
<p>It happens that one of those friends is an electronic engineer and software programmer and the other one is a jewelry designer.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/325/504/f290a21aa24315f15f7f9ba5372903c3_large.jpg?1357305849"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h1>The Project</h1>
<p><strong>Michele:</strong> ""I've been a jewelry designer and a goldsmith for more then 15 years and I put all my experience in this project. We've spent the last five months researching, designing and developing the most perfect shape to marry Instagram pictures to our jewels and this is the result: clean lines and special materials as gold, silver and glossy plastic.""</p>
<p>Our JewelGram collection is made in <strong>Venice</strong> (Italy) with <strong>high jewelry techniques </strong>and a strong attention to details.</p>

<h1><strong>Product Specifications</strong></h1>
<p>Every JewelGram comes with a <strong>0.98x0.98″ (25x25 mm) area</strong> to print pictures. Considering that Instagram stores pictures at 612x612 pixel of maximum resolution it means that we are printing them at <strong>more then 600 dpi</strong> (dots per inch) resolution.

<p>Our plastic rings have the following European ring sizes: 12-14-16-18-20-22-24. Our precious metal rings instead are equipped with an adjustable ring size system.</p>

Turn your Instagram pictures into jewels designed and made in Venice (Italy) with precious metals or high quality plastic materials.





 

The Story
Some months ago two Instagram-addict friends Gianpiero and Michele were discussing on how much it would have been great to have jewels with Instagram pictures printed on them. In fact, they thought, there is a famous citation that says ""Diamonds are forever""... ""but pictures too!"" they said.
JewelGram comes from this: it turns your Instagram pictures into jewels.
It happens that one of those friends is an electronic engineer and software programmer and the other one is a jewelry designer.

The Project
Michele: ""I've been a jewelry designer and a goldsmith for more then 15 years and I put all my experience in this project. We've spent the last five months researching, designing and developing the most perfect shape to marry Instagram pictures to our jewels and this is the result: clean lines and special materials as gold, silver and glossy plastic.""
Our JewelGram collection is made in Venice (Italy) with high jewelry techniques and a strong attention to details.
To better highlight Instagram pictures we use the sublimation print which allows us to stamp any kind of image at a high resolution, merging it with the jewel, as we want to make sure your JewelGram, with your favorite picture on it, will last forever.
Finishes and treatments of our precious metals (silver and gold) jewels are hand-wrought. So, like fingerprints no two such JewelGrams are exactly identical.

Product Specifications
Every JewelGram comes with a 0.98x0.98″ (25x25 mm) area to print pictures. Considering that Instagram stores pictures at 612x612 pixel of maximum resolution it means that we are printing them at more then 600 dpi (dots per inch) resolution. Extremely good considering that human beings are not able to recognize dots printed over 300 dpi.
Our plastic rings have the following European ring sizes: 12-14-16-18-20-22-24. Our precious metal rings instead are equipped with an adjustable ring size system.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p class=""p1"">Ousia LMNTL is a concept for clothing that communicates and expresses ideas through functional art. It was birthed in the mind of Dillon Dunning, an artist from Hoboken, NJ. The overall goal is to integrate great philosophical ideas into high fashion imagery. Combining art's transformative powers of the spirit and philosophy's desire for the spirit, the quest for knowledge, wisdom and understanding of the Absolute Truth. Art should be extremely accessible to people, so while hanging a painting on the wall is beautiful, not everyone can afford that, most can afford a beautifully crafted designed piece of clothing that one can enjoy in a different manner. Philosophy is the literally the love of wisdom, and the quest to obtain it.  Its a dialogue that has been taken place since we began to think, especially subjectively. But again most think of it as an outside realm that might seem inaccessible to the masses. So again trying to put in directly in the people's hands. A major argument amongst philosophers has been which is a higher product of the mind, Art or Philosophy, so with this project the two will be interwoven.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Topics will vary from the various schools of philosophy, with a focus on Existentialism and various historical ideas that lead to development of that movement. This will serve as a main focus first because of the overall sentiment of our times in relation of the self to the world. We are thrown into this world not by our doing, into a circumstance that we didn't create, but now are responsible for our lives.  Overall what works for one, might not work for others, but i feel the basic notion of everything being connected at some level is reason enough to make an attempt at a ""good"" life.</p>
<p>Principles of Sacred Geometry will be employed in creating compostions of the graphics, and in order to inject more  transformative energies into the designs. These principles will help create textures, patterns, and layout. </p>
<p>The word <em>ousia</em> (Ooh-Si-Ah)was first used by Aristotle, in order to describe the primary substance of everything. This substance is the essence of that particular thing's existence, and without this substance that thing will no longer be. Existentialsim teaches that through existence we get to create our essence.. </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div>
<div>
<p class=""p1"">The first products will be t-shirts, they are the most common item people where, and also provide a nice canvas for a beautiful piece. I do want to get shirts that are manufactured in the U.S.A. Looking forward, if the concept is able to grow further, I will continue to use American Manufactured products. Not that the quality of products manufactured in other countries aren't of a high quality, I just feel in these times investing into American Companies to produce American Products is best.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The screen printers that I work with are local as well, so I can have a very hand on approach, and be accessible to them for any reason. Keeping it local also invests locally, hopefully with your help and your investment in me I will be able to get this off the ground and invest in others by providing work for them. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Funds will go to cost of screens and the printing, and the t-shirts. I want the best quality, American made T-Shirts available. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Screens are generally between $15-25 per screen, with a burning fee of $20-30 so that total will be around $50-60 for per screen, and its one screen per color. Depending on what the graphic calls for, some shirts will call for 1 color, while others will have multiple colors. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Also for larger shirts, larger screens will be needed. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Screens also last, so its a one time fee in creating them, and then I will have them for the future. </p>
<p class=""p1"">Shirts are generally wholesale for under $10 per shirt (again I want the highest quality shirt out there, 100% cotton, with a nice weight to it), and of course the Perks being offered are I hope are unique as well in an attempt to bring those involved even closer to the project. Because every dollar counts, at $1, they will get a handwritten thank you not with a philosophical quote that hopefully they will think about. From there perks will include prints of the graphics, paintings, clothing, etc. </p>
<p class=""p1"">My idea for the perks is about bringing people into my process, at different donation levels, they'll receive the artwork in some stage of creation. The highest level will be a book containing the entire process, from brainstorming concpets thtough finalized art work. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p class=""p1"">I think the importance lies in getting ideas into people's hands and allowing the ideas to grow within them. The idea is not to make people think a certain way, but just to get people to think about things. The more that goes into one's mind the more the mind produces. Everyone is unique by birth, everyone is special and have their own special beauty they can bring into this world. Not everyone can be a singer, or a sports star, but in the same respect not everyone can be amazing at chess, or a brilliant mathematician. By contributing you are fueling what drives me, I want everyone to be able to be apart of art and philosophy because of the ultimate benefits both have on one. Art gets to use methods to get into our minds without doing much beyond observing. The clothing must look amazing and then the concepts can seep it... </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p class=""p1"">You can help just by passing this along. You might be the one to link me with the person(s) that can donate. Passing it along, or posting on this on your social network site is helping out by moving the energy. If enough people give a little it'll go along way. </p>
</div>
<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Short Summary

This will serve as a main focus first because of the overall sentiment of our times in relation of the self to the world. We are thrown into this world not by our doing, into a circumstance that we didn't create, but now are responsible for our lives.  Overall what works for one, might not work for others, but i feel the basic notion of everything being connected at some level is reason enough to make an attempt at a ""good"" life.
Principles of Sacred Geometry will be employed in creating compostions of the graphics, and in order to inject more  transformative energies into the designs. These principles will help create textures, patterns, and layout. 
The word ousia (Ooh-Si-Ah)was first used by Aristotle, in order to describe the primary substance of everything. This substance is the essence of that particular thing's existence, and without this substance that thing will no longer be. Existentialsim teaches that through existence we get to create our essence.. 
What We Need & What You Get


The first products will be t-shirts, they are the most common item people where, and also provide a nice canvas for a beautiful piece. I do want to get shirts that are manufactured in the U.S.A. Looking forward, if the concept is able to grow further, I will continue to use American Manufactured products. Not that the quality of products manufactured in other countries aren't of a high quality, I just feel in these times investing into American Companies to produce American Products is best.
The screen printers that I work with are local as well, so I can have a very hand on approach, and be accessible to them for any reason. Keeping it local also invests locally, hopefully with your help and your investment in me I will be able to get this off the ground and invest in others by providing work for them. 
Funds will go to cost of screens and the printing, and the t-shirts. I want the best quality, American made T-Shirts available. 
Screens are generally between $15-25 per screen, with a burning fee of $20-30 so that total will be around $50-60 for per screen, and its one screen per color. Depending on what the graphic calls for, some shirts will call for 1 color, while others will have multiple colors. 
Also for larger shirts, larger screens will be needed. 
Screens also last, so its a one time fee in creating them, and then I will have them for the future. 
Shirts are generally wholesale for under $10 per shirt (again I want the highest quality shirt out there, 100% cotton, with a nice weight to it), and of course the Perks being offered are I hope are unique as well in an attempt to bring those involved even closer to the project. Because every dollar counts, at $1, they will get a handwritten thank you not with a philosophical quote that hopefully they will think about. From there perks will include prints of the graphics, paintings, clothing, etc. 
My idea for the perks is about bringing people into my process, at different donation levels, they'll receive the artwork in some stage of creation. The highest level will be a book containing the entire process, from brainstorming concpets thtough finalized art work. 


The Impact
I think the importance lies in getting ideas into people's hands and allowing the ideas to grow within them. The idea is not to make people think a certain way, but just to get people to think about things. The more that goes into one's mind the more the mind produces. Everyone is unique by birth, everyone is special and have their own special beauty they can bring into this world. Not everyone can be a singer, or a sports star, but in the same respect not everyone can be amazing at chess, or a brilliant mathematician. By contributing you are fueling what drives me, I want everyone to be able to be apart of art and philosophy because of the ultimate benefits both have on one. Art gets to use methods to get into our minds without doing much beyond observing. The clothing must look amazing and then the concepts can seep it... 


Other Ways You Can Help
You can help just by passing this along. You might be the one to link me with the person(s) that can donate. Passing it along, or posting on this on your social network site is helping out by moving the energy. If enough people give a little it'll go along way. 

And that’s all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Sharing is Caring

 
Why shouldn’t every company give 10% of its net profits to a good cause?
It actually should be a regular practice in this world, where so many worthy causes exist.

Making Waves in the Fashion Industry

We see no reason to use animal products in the name of fashion. It’s all about looking sexy isn’t it? So why use the skin, feathers or fur of an animal to accomplish that? So, Sonas San Francisco does not use and will never use any animal products in its entire collection. We hope that our colleagues in the fashion industry follow suit.
 
Reducing Our Carbon Footprint

So, I know it’s hard to be the perfect company, but we do our part in trying decrease our carbon footprint as much as possible. Sonas Denim recycles everything and we waste no material. So all of our fabric cuttings are actually turned into greeting cards and other accessories, so that nothing moves on to landfill.

 Hopes For the Future

We have high hopes.  I know this might seem like we are dreaming big, but why not shoot for the stars?  Our hope is that we will be in a financial position in the future to be able to fund an animal  sanctuary off the California 1 Fwy coastal route somewhere between San Francisco and Pescadero.  Our vision is that we will have ambassador animals there and give people a small cafe and gift shop to stop off at...maybe even a small B & B.  We'll keep you posted on our progress!

Risks & Challenges


Measurements taken by our online customers put in are extremely important, so to minimise the risk of any mistakes or misapprehensions, we made concise instructions that show how to take measurements properly and precisely. However, small errors in measurement can be difficult to avoid, but we are putting other checks and balances in place to decrease this risk and facilitate the process. 
Once you have submitted your order it is personally checked by your tailor.  If a measurement seems unusual, we will check back with you first before resuming your order. 
The way we have chosen to make wedding dresses is all made possible by very experienced tailors in their specialised workshop where they have been working for many top labels of the fashion industry, for over twenty years, with us checking every step of the way. From fabric shipment, to detailed stitching and all the way to the back tags, we want the product you receive to be everything you dreamed of. So, beyond fit and appearance, we pay attention to every detail at each stage which inevitably takes time. This additional time is a commitment that goes into making sure that each link  of our supply chain is robust and that the extra effort ensures each stitch is in the right place - that may pose challenges for us (communication, logistics, packaging, shipping, etc.), but we think it is worth it.

aren't treated with pesticides, insecticides, herbicides and Genetically
 Modified Organisms. These toxins are harmful for farmers and workers, 
us as consumers, and entire wildlife eco-systems. </p>And yet, less than one percent of all cotton grown is organic. We can and must do better.        - The Huffington Post</li>
<li>10% Of the profit raised from our campaign will be going to food programs for elementary school kids. Coming from where I'm from, if it wasn't for programs like this I wouldn't of had food when I was a kid.

  The Impact


The main benefit of organic materials, however, is that the crops 
aren't treated with pesticides, insecticides, herbicides and Genetically
 Modified Organisms. These toxins are harmful for farmers and workers, 
us as consumers, and entire wildlife eco-systems. And yet, less than one percent of all cotton grown is organic. We can and must do better.        - The Huffington Post
10% Of the profit raised from our campaign will be going to food programs for elementary school kids. Coming from where I'm from, if it wasn't for programs like this I wouldn't of had food when I was a kid. I believe in these programs 100% and you will see Social Con getting more involved in the youth.

<h3>It was all a dream...</h3>
<p>If you know me, you know that one of the things I aspire to do the most is create and/or run a successful organization that is a game changer for all of it's affiliates and stakeholders. Today, I'm happy to announce that I may be closer to my aspiration than we think, which is why this campaign exists. </p>
<p>The concept for the BLK Life Brand came from a desire to engineer a multifaceted imprint used to creatively characterize the various ways in which we strive to find our way.  The idea to dedicate our collection to a niche of innovators and go getters was inspired by the great works of Lifted Research Group (LRG). The collection was designed solely by yours truly and hopefully the successful launch will be powered by you. </p>

<h3>Here's what we need...</h3>
<p>In order to begin production of phase one [our limited edition fitted caps], we need to raise $5000. This will cover the cost of preparing the designs for digital embroidery and the acquiring of the actual caps. Additionally, the $5k will cover the cost to revamp our current website and a portion of our social media marketing budget (mostly post boosting on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter).</p>
