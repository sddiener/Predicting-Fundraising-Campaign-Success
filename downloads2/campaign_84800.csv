<p>On 12-18-20 a group of musicians from Alabama came together, supported by other musicians from around the country to help support Tuscaloosa, Alabama-based Druid City Brewing Company (DCBC).  With the challenges and limitations COVID-19 has presented this past year, the decision to make the music event virtual was a way for artists and audience to connect and interact in the safety of their own homes. Chat features provided through the live stream allowed for audience participation and sense of community that we all know and love as part of the DCBC music experience, but with the safety and social distancing allowed through being live streamed. It was a way for people to support an indie brewery that fosters original music and continues to fight hard to be a home for original music in West Alabama. The participating artists, and many others, formed a connection to a venue that works to support independent artists and a community who listened and made them feel welcome. This event helped keep DCBC above water through these challenging times while also helping artists reconnect to a loving and caring audience.</p>
<p>Among the artists were a group of amazingly talented musicians based in Tuscaloosa: Tom Rathe, Patrick O'Sullivan, Adam Ingram, Brantley Charles and the One Timers, Matthew Wurtele and Matt Bryant. These artists flourished and felt as much part of the DCBC family as they did performers. It felt like so much more than just a live stream or a concert, but an ode to the brewery and the community it has built. Through all the hard work by the many involved, we here at Druid City were able to see through a dark time and reconnect with all of our beloved performers and patrons through the live stream event. </p>
<p>Druid City also happens to be neighbors with Oz Music, the last indie music store in Tuscaloosa. In an effort to support a sister small business that has always had such a strong foundation in the Tuscaloosa music scene, we thought it would be super cool to press these magical performances to vinyl and donate proceeds to Oz Music as well as showcase some of Tuscaloosa's finest indie musicians in one fail swoop. </p>
<p>Oz will receive their normal margin on all records sold. The rest will be divided among the musicians who, through their selfless teamwork, enriched the lives of an entire community. We believe this will stand as a beautiful reminder that even during dark times there is still plenty of beauty in the world, and that through community and art we will make it through this together.</p>
<p>This is where y'all come in! Pre-ordering the album will help us cover the high upfront cost of set up and pressing this very small run of albums. There will be a standard cost of $20 with a limited number of 35 that will be hand signed by all the artist and hand numbered for a cost of $35. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts, from Oz's hearts and from the amazing humans that make our community what it is. Air hugs and high fives! Keep it between the mayo and mustard!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Matthew King, and I am  a multi-instrumentalist, producer, and the composer behind the band TapRoots.  TapRoots seeks to travel beyond the boundaries of traditional popular music, bringing the listener on a journey filled with catchy hooks, pulsing rhythms, thought provoking lyrics and intricate musical motifs, all fueled by a unique synthesis of sound, spirit and passion into a powerful listening experience.  While the music is an alchemical cauldron of rock, reggae, salsa, soul, folkloric rhythms and beyond, it taps into the roots of these traditions while imagining something refreshingly new.</p>
<p>In 2018, TapRoots released its debut self-titled CD. While the music and the band has been gaining momentum, performing at festivals and venues throughout the Northeastern US, the recent pandemic has had a crippling effect on our ability to perform publicly. But I have moved forward and used this time to build upon the creative momentum of the first album and write a new series of global fusion compositions that takes our original blend of Afro-Latin Folkloric Soul Fusion to new heights! I am hoping to get these new compositions into the studio this upcoming Summer, which is why I am appealing to you, my fans and fans-to-be, to help me realize this dream. The costs of studio time are beyond my humble means, but I am deeply passionate about realizing the fullness of this incredible music. It would mean everything to me if you could help me bring this music to the world.</p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The production of a CD is no small task, as I found out the first time around. Studio time costs more money than I could have imagined, as well as editing, mixing, mastering, and printing CDs. All money collected through this process will go 100% towards the recording and releasing of this CD. From what I am led to understand, the very least I need to do this right is $15,000.</p>
<p>Here is a list of my current estimated expenses. </p>
<p>Recording sessions- $7000-$8000 (including paying guest musicians for their time)</p>
<p>Mixing- $1500</p>
<p>Mastering- $1500</p>
<p>Original Artwork- $1200</p>
<p>CD Duplication- $2000</p>
<p>Promotion - $1000+ (this will be ongoing and most likely at least double)</p>
<p>New music to feed your body, mind and soul - Priceless !</p>
<p>Estimated total cost- $15,000+</p>
<p>If for some reason I don't meet my campaign goal, I will put all raised funds towards the recording process and do what I can to fund the rest myself, but for a poor public school teacher this will not be easy (which is why I need to ask y'all for help). I hope to make this music as affordable and accessible as possible to all, and hopefully it can continue to propel me further down this exciting musical journey that started 3 years ago.</p>
<p>As for perks, I will be printing up a very limited amount of T Shirts with the album cover art, seen on this fundraising page and once again designed by the amazing Martin Bridge, a limited run of posters, as well as a selection of my own home-made culinary and medicinal treats (Home Cooked Meals, Hot Sauce, Perfume oils, etc), percussion/guitar lessons and other prizes will be a part of the package as well.</p>
<p>With your help, I hope to get started recording this Summer, and hope for a New Year's release date.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Anyone that knows my eclectic tastes in music will tell you that whatever I come up with will be a breath of fresh air and meaningful artistic contribution to the current state of contemporary music.  This music has something to say, and will lend its voice to the world at a time when we need more music with a message.  The themes of the songs range from the overtly political to the deeply esoteric and everything in-between. I am also an audiophile and a big fan of complex, thickly layered soundscapes; those that know my previous work will attest to my perfectionism and professionalism in the studio. For a taste of what the last CD sounded like, feel free to visit my website to stream it for free: <a href=""https://www.thetaprootsmovement.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.thetaprootsmovement.com/</a> This one will take that blueprint and expand on it a thousandfold. In many ways, the last CD was the music that I personally wanted to hear in the world; this album is more about what the world has demanded of us all in these trying times of change.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>PLEASE do what you can to spread the word about this campaign: share it with all of your friends and family, put it out there on social media, and tell your rich uncles that this is right up their alley!</p>

<h3>A Vision into the Future</h3>
<p>   </p>
<p>    A few years ago, after the death of a close relative, I had gone away from home to join a  shaman's ceremony in an attempt to erase my feelings of infinite darkness. What ended up happening was I traded one darkness for another. I experienced vivid hallucinations, or visions, of what I believe was the end of the world. Shockingly, the context that was most disturbing - was that it wasn't any big catastrophe that led to its demise. What killed the world was just normal everyday life...the apocalypse was being caused by business as usual. </p>
<p>     As an artist I felt compelled to say something. <br/>    The storyboard for Business As Usual started in 2019, and at that time we had been waiting for the AR6 IPCC report to come out (in 2022) so that we could more accurately depict the storyline. After 'Just Wait', I was hesitant about making another animated video because they are very expensive and very difficult to make. But after reading policymaker summary, we decided there is no more time. In fact, <i>some of </i><i>the scenes had to be adjusted from the storyboard written in 2019 to instead reflect the predictions given by the IPCC, which are actually <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>worse.</strong></a></i></p>
<p>    The music is written by <a href=""http://manifestiv.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ManifestiV</a>, an electronic industrial band who is currently residing in Texas, and is once again joining forces with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYTPB-dRcp9hPKjfNNfelyA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MHR Cartoon</a> to tell the story of our future: a future in which absolutely nothing was done, where business as usual continued, where old habits never died, where the debt of our extractions mounted until it all came painfully crashing down. </p>

In 2021 we will be bringing you No Hope for the Fallen. A brand new studio album featuring 6 amazing new tracks.We have finished song writing and are ready for recording. On this occasion we are parting ways with our former label and taking absolute control of the entire creative process. While there are costs that have been already assumed by the band, such as artwork and part of the production, after a year without live shows we are relying on our fans to help us reach our target and make gothic metal great again!If you could consider backing us, not only will you be enjoying our new tracks before anyone else, you will be an integral part of this album.Will you help us spread the sorrow? ABOUT THE ALBUMNo Hope for the Fallen continues in the line of our debut album Rulers of a Dying World. You can expect some catchy gothic metal anthems and darker and more epic tracks. Sounds good? There’s more!The new tracks will also feature the latest addition to the Son of Sorrow family, our new vocalist Yolanda Rosado, which will allow us to explore new sounds with contrasting male and female vocals, reminding diehard fans of some of the most iconic bands in the genre.If our previous album managed to collect awards and nominations as ‘Best Gothic Metal Album of the Year’, we are confident that we are on track to once again reap awesome reviews with our new E.P.Tracklist, including a brief description is as follows:1. Hope is a Prelude to Sorrow. – an instrumental overture, a crescendo of crows.2. No Hope for the Fallen – The title track: powerful and melodic Nu Goth Metal.3. Error – an energetic track kicking off with a memorable piano melody.4. Firebird – Gothic Rock for petrol-heads.5. Sin King – Doomy Gothic Metal, with lyrics that will tear your heart out.6. A Forlorn Memory – our voyage into Epic Gothic Metal.*Following recording, the tracklist’s order may vary. WHAT YOU WILL BE HELPING WITH:We are aiming to achieve a goal of 1,200 Euros, which is only a part of the costs of putting together the new album, in order to complete this exciting project. Your contribution will help us with the following:
Recording Costs: We will be returning to Jotun Studio, Spain, working with producer Leo Peña. While production has commenced, we are still facing mixing and further recording sessions. Once this is complete, we will be then mastering all tracks at the amazing Finnvox studios, Finland, who have worked with heavyweights of the genre such as HIM, The 69 Eyes or Nightwish among many others.

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>I'm Zachary and I have been writing and recording music under the stage name Apres Pompeii for almost 10 years now. At the beginning of 2020 I started to record a few leftover songs that hadn't been recorded and released yet--these songs eventually grew into more songs and those songs formed what is to be my 3rd full length record: <i>Clay</i>. As a music lover and collector it's always been my dream to have one of my projects be released on vinyl and this feels like the perfect record to press--these songs are lush, intimate, and spacious and I really think they'd shine on wax</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Crowdfund?</h3>
<p>Until this project I have always funded my music 100% out of my own pocket. <i>Clay</i> is recorded, mastered, and ready to release but vinyl done correctly would require a remaster for the format change. Also I plan to work as local and small as possible and cutting out mass production also raises the price but would keep the money in the community and keep things as independent as we can.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know how difficult the past year has been for so many people and know that giving any amount is a lot to ask. I really believe in these songs and all I ask is that you share them as much as possible--at the end of the day my greatest dream is just for the music to be heard. Hopefully this batch of songs can bring some comfort, catharsis, or beauty into your lives</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Zachary ❤️</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who we are and what's the plan</h3>
<p>We are Angel Nation, a melodic metal band based in UK/Germany. We are beyond excited to finally be recording our third album called 'Antares' (album cover artwork by Sledgehammer Graphix). It’s been a while since our last release Aeon, but believe us, it’s worth the wait! This album will bring Angel Nation back with full force, showcasing 10 tracks of musical versatility and evolvement of the band. For the powerful sound these songs deserve, we’re happy to be joining forces with Alexander Krull, who will be mixing and mastering our album.</p>
<p>We’re asking you to join us on this journey to make this album a reality! A huge thank you in advance for your help and we can’t wait for you to hear the final result, which we think is our best work yet!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As many of you know, making an album is much more than just recording the musical parts. To get an idea, here’s a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixing &amp; Mastering</li>
<li>Artwork</li>
<li>Photoshoots</li>
<li>Videoshoots</li>
<li>Promotion before and after release</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>..and of course we hope there will be touring in the future!</p>
<p>All this added together means costs get high, so we’re asking for your help to make it happen. Our goal won't cover everything, but all funds raised will be used towards the release of the album. In return we’ve created some unique perks that we hope you find interesting and engaging. There are some very exclusive offers and opportunities to support us.</p>
<p>Ultimate package: Can't wait? Video of a cover song and Elina talking about the album and why it took so long to write will be accessible right after the campaign ends! </p>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Here we go again! <i>Don't Say Love</i> will be my fourth original single and final music video before dropping my seven song E.P. As you know with my first video, <i>Omertà</i>, my goal is to approach every music video more like a film. With that, comes major production logistics to keep the visuals in a cinematic world rather than typical pop videos. </p>
<p>The last campaign was such a success, I decided to aim even bigger for the finale of this era. The visuals for <i>Don't Say Love </i>will be heavily inspired by Ridley Scott's, <i>Blade Runner. </i>Cinematically futuristic, cyber-punk, and dystopian.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need </strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT - ""That sounds expensive!"" - if only 400 people donate $25 we already achieve the goal! Not so impossible! Whatever you can contribute will be utilized responsibly. We understand the state of things around the world right now, so even $1 counts!  </p>
<p>As an actor, I have been very lucky to accumulate a wide network of incredible talents in all sorts of industries. From videographers, to visionary directors, to stylists and talented hair and makeup gurus - I want to make this project not only visually stunning, but incorporate as many of these talented artists as I can, AND PAY THEM! </p>
<p>I hope this footage will elevate the song to a level that will leave a lasting impression. This will all come down to having the necessary budget to allocate to all the needs of a project on this scale.</p>
<p>THE MONEY WILL GO TO- Locations, permits, editing, film equipment, insurance, sound, crew members, fees, director, talent, props, styling, makeup, hair, post-production marketing, Covid safety measures, and more.</p>
<p>So I know its cringe to crowdfund, but I love artists, my friends and music, and I want to aim big!  We did it once, we can do it again!</p>

The last campaign was such a success, I decided to aim even bigger for the finale of this era. The visuals for Don't Say Love will be heavily inspired by Ridley Scott's, Blade Runner. Cinematically futuristic, cyber-punk, and dystopian.
 
What We Need 

BEFORE YOU FREAK OUT - ""That sounds expensive!"" - if only 400 people donate $25 we already achieve the goal! Not so impossible! Whatever you can contribute will be utilized responsibly. We understand the state of things around the world right now, so even $1 counts!  
As an actor, I have been very lucky to accumulate a wide network of incredible talents in all sorts of industries. From videographers, to visionary directors, to stylists and talented hair and makeup gurus - I want to make this project not only visually stunning, but incorporate as many of these talented artists as I can, AND PAY THEM! 
I hope this footage will elevate the song to a level that will leave a lasting impression. This will all come down to having the necessary budget to allocate to all the needs of a project on this scale.
THE MONEY WILL GO TO- Locations, permits, editing, film equipment, insurance, sound, crew members, fees, director, talent, props, styling, makeup, hair, post-production marketing, Covid safety measures, and more.
So I know its cringe to crowdfund, but I love artists, my friends and music, and I want to aim big!  We did it once, we can do it again!

The Impact
If we do meet our goal, I hope that you will also watch this video and feel how emotionally invested I am in the entire process and creation of this vision.

<p>This epic collection of songs spans our usual cocktail of alternative. metal, industrial, punk &amp; trap! This time with a more melodic dimension and musical scope that is by far our most ambitious undertaking! This is the record fans have been waiting for!</p>

<h2><strong>Your Support Will Make It Happen! </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, everyone! I’m Alex Hollmann, and I am so excited to officially announce the release of my <strong>new album <i>Out with the Tide</i> on September 3rd, 2021!</strong> Last summer, I had the pleasure of going to a professional studio to record 14 original songs, but now I need your help to finish funding the manufacturing, distribution, and launch of the album during this 20-day crowdfunding campaign. With your support, I plan to finally release my music to all of your favorite places to get music – Spotify, Apple Music, iTunes, YouTube, Amazon, and for those that still love a physical copy, a<strong> limited-edition CD</strong>. <i>The deadline to contribute is Saturday, August 28, 2021 11:59pm PDT.</i> The project is in the final stretch, but I need your help to bring it (into your) home! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>About <i>Out with the Tide</i> </h3>
<p><i>Out with the Tide</i> is a collection of 14, never-before-released original songs. I have been songwriting since I was in junior high, but this is the first time I am truly putting my music out there for the world to hear. All the songs are written and performed by me – just me singing with my piano – true to how the songs were originally conceived. The album has songs about letting go, songs about yearning for connection, and songs about how sometimes those two things conflict. <br/> </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>My crowdfunding goal is <strong>$2,500</strong> based on the remaining costs to get the album fully released. The music has already been recorded, mixed, and mastered, but there are just a few more steps before it reaches you. </p>
<p>Your support will help to fund:<br/>•    Digital distribution – putting my music on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, etc. <br/>•    CD manufacturing &amp; distribution – producing the physical album and getting it to YOU. <br/>•    Marketing – getting the word out so everyone knows where to listen. <br/>•    Album launch – celebrating the official release with an event/concert. </p>
<p>I’ve chosen Indiegogo’s “flexible funding” option, so even if we don’t reach the goal, the album will still move forward as planned and you will receive your perks!</p>

<p>The whole point of this project is to get my music to YOU.

<h3><strong>We've been told we're not making opera in the normal way. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Well, that’s always been our intention. </strong></h3>
<p>For more than four hundred years, operas have been written and performed around the world, but there’s been a common thread in the majority of these works: <i>women suffer</i>. Often at the hands of men who seek to control them. But what if women commanded the narrative?</p>
<p><i>Iphigenia</i> is an opera <i>debased</i> on the myths by Euripides, with music by legendary 11-time Grammy Award-winning saxophonist and composer <strong>Wayne Shorter</strong> and a libretto by bassist, composer, and vocalist <strong>Esperanza Spalding</strong>, the first jazz musician to be awarded the Grammy for Best New Artist. Their subversive and daring interrogation of the tale of the sacrificial daughter of Greece represents Wayne's first foray into the classical form, and the culmination of a lifelong dream of his to compose an opera since he was a 19 year-old music student.</p>
<p><i>Iphigenia</i> is not an adaptation of the Greek myth as much as it is an intervention into myth-making itself. Led by award-winning director <strong>Lileana Blain-Cruz</strong>, and abetted by luminary architect and scenic designer <strong>Frank Gehry</strong>, the entire creative process has led us to understand how stories have been traditionally told, and how we must disrupt existing systems and create our own alternative structures and stories.</p>
<h3><strong>Real Magic is artist-led development.</strong></h3>
<p>Artists need the right conditions to do their best work. To meet this need, Esperanza and executive creative producer Jeff Tang founded an independent company, Real Magic, to bring <i>Iphigenia</i> to life. Working in partnership with producer Cath Brittan and with Mara Isaacs of Octopus Theatricals, along with our co-commissioning partners, our goal has been to develop <i>Iphigenia</i> in an environment of radical experimentation and open collaboration, free from commercial expectations. Over the past two years we've done just that, working and rehearsing out of college classrooms, guest houses, black box theaters, and even Frank Gehry's kitchen. And now, we're ready to bring it to the world.</p>
<h3><strong>We need your help to make it happen.</strong></h3>
<p>Freedom brings responsibility, and creating an opera with world-class artists and collaborators brings costs. The COVID-19 pandemic may have thrown us off our original track, but as Wayne says, resistance is simply the force that helps planes get off the ground. By joining together and adding your voice to our growing chorus of supporters, which also includes sponsors and partners, we can realize this once in a generation collaborative vision.</p>
<p>Your support for the creation of Iphigenia through your tax-deductible* contribution will go directly to underwriting our incredible artists, designers, and creative team, as well as the final development workshop leading up to our premiere and tour (soon to be announced!) in Fall 2021 and beyond. In return, you'll receive unique benefits, including special access to conversations and rehearsals, limited edition merch, and of course, public recognition.</p>
<p>Please give what you can and spread the word!</p>
<p>We stand in gratitude.</p>

<h3>GROUNDED AGAIN is as much for you as it was for me</h3>
<p>An artist isn't much without an audience.  Though we're compelled to create for the sake of creating, we also need to influence, inspire, and touch the lives of others with the works we produce.  To that end, you are essential.</p>
<p>GROUNDED AGAIN tells a story that I'm certain most - if not all - of you are intimately familiar with.  Man falls in love, man gets his heart broken, man struggles to find his place in the world, man fights depression and the disillusionment from even more failed relationships.</p>
<p>I am confident that there's at least one song in GROUNDED AGAIN that's for you.  I wrote the album for me, but I'm sharing it for you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need (&amp; What You Get)</h3>
<p>I am an amateur ""living room"" producer, and there's a lot I can't do:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u><strong>Mastering</strong></u> - Tracks must be mastered to get the best sound out of the work I've done.  This isn't something I'm skilled at, so I must turn to others.  Automated mastering is a thing now, and a 14-track album can run anywhere from $120-140.  Professional mastering is significantly more expensive but produces much higher quality results.  Professional mastering for this album would run me about $600</li>
<li>
<strong><u>Digital Distribution</u></strong> - Services like Spotify, Google Play, etc... are vital to independent artists these days.  Digital distribution is required to reach the widest audience possible and to provide my fans with the most convenient access to my music.  This will cost around $50.</li>
<li>
<strong><u>Download Cards</u></strong> - As much as I still love the old-school, traditional format of a physical CD, most people want digital albums.  And although streaming services are ideal in most cases, some folks would rather own a copy to ensure they always have access.  This will cost me about $50.</li>
<li>
<strong><u>Hard copies</u></strong> - I know I've just spent the last two bullets talking about digital music, but I can't turn my back on the physical format.  A real, in-hand album is the true culmination of everything an artist has worked toward.  To me, an album's cover and booklet art are just as much a part of the final expression as the songs themselves.  My debut album was popular in this format, selling copies both Stateside and Internationally.  I was quite popular in Brazil, believe it or not!  100 copies of the album as currently designed will cost about $530.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What do you get for helping out??</h3>
<p>Depending on how much you're able to help out and how much (in total) I manage to earn from my generous fans, perks could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A digital copy of GROUNDED AGAIN (hopefully with a digital booklet, if I can iron out the logistics for that)</li>
<li>A physical copy of GROUNDED AGAIN in CD format, in a full-color digipak with lyrics booklet</li>
<li>A cover of any song of your choosing</li>
<li>A ""jingle"" written especially for you about you (or whatever else* you request)</li>
<li>A physical and/or digital copy of my debut album</li>
<li>A shoutout in the GROUNDED AGAIN lyrics booklet</li>
</ul>
<h3>So what's the bottom line?</h3>
<p>If I hit my goal, all perks will be deliverable on the timeline designated.  The bare minimum I can raise to meet all <i>digital</i> perks is $245.  Physical copies of GROUNDED AGAIN will be delayed if I don't hit my desired goal ($785).  They'll be deliverable just as soon as I can save up the rest of the necessary funds.  I'll be sure to update you in that event, but we can avoid that by sharing this campaign with friends and family and encouraging them to pledge!!</p>

<p>I am so excited to finally release my first, self-titled, EP on Madison Line Records this summer and cannot wait to share my soulful pop worship with the world!

<h3>Me, and My Music</h3>
<p>I joined a chanter beginners class to celebrate turning 50. But my background was a Bachelor of Music Degree from Glasgow University (1978) and Postgraduate qualifications in Music Therapy and Psychoanalytical Psychotherapy. I wanted to compose bagpipe music, but I wasn't a famous piper. Would it be possible? Some thought not. I started small, and found support and encouragement at Bob Dunsire Bagpipe Forums. Making full use of this, I kept going and learned along the way. The previous six compositions have enjoyed over 13,000 hits on YouTube, and many people have written movingly about the effect the music has had on them personally. I never for a second thought that one day Willie McCallum and Jim McGillivray would record one of my compositions, but we are now on the verge of this happening, WITH YOUR HELP. This is huge, and nerve-wracking, exciting, and innovative, all at once!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Music</h3>
<p>Lacrimae is a complex piobaireachd form composition, in which the two performers, Willie McCallum and Jim McGillivray, who would normally play piobaireachd solo, are required to play the entire piece as a duet, involving split second precision timing, immense concentration, and exquisite musicality. Craig Muirhead, himself a Grade 1 piper, will be required to support the Urlar or Ground of the piece on keyboard, laying down the harmony which underlies the construction of the composition.</p>
<p>It will tug at your heartstrings, bring a tear to the eye, resonate with your personal lifestory, and even lift you up and have you marvelling at the possibilities of the instrument.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>To make this happen we need in excess of £3,200, but this amount would cover the bulk of the expenses to make it happen.</p>
<p>This is for the pipers' and keyboard player's fees, expenses and costs, hotel accommodation, air travel, rent of recording space, food and drink for performers, Video Production, Editing and Mixing, and Administrative backup.</p>
<p>There are RISKS. What if one of the performers is ill on the day? A bagpipe malfunction ? A power cut that affects the whole of Glasgow? Etc etc etc. I'm ready for those. This recording WILL happen. There's always a way around a problem. I believe in the team assembled for the task, and know they will make it happen. I am not new to hurdles. I know them like the back of my hand, and so far have always jumped over them!</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>I'm just about done recording two solo albums, Rad and Trad, which have been a long time in the making. This has been a solitary process, I am doing all the playing, singing and recording myself. I am now in the process of laying down the vocals and feel that it's time to properly introduce this project to the world. With that I hope that you'll join me on the last stretch of this journey (big words, I know) by partaking in the campaign or spreading the word (or why not both?)!</p>
<p>I've put a lot of my previous work in the perks section to the right here, so you'll have to do a bit of scrolling to see everything. If you're interested in bundling up perks but don't find an option for that just get in touch and we'll work it out! There are also lessons and performances if you scroll far enough.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thanks for checking out this page, it means a lot to me! You might not know who you're on the verge of supporting, so I'll introduce myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Magnus Wiik, and I've been playing music since I was a kid. I started out playing fingerstyle guitar before my age reached the double digits, and my interest took off in my early teens when I discovered hairy men who played fast guitar. I eventually gravitated toward jazz, and parallell to that I discovered bluegrass and Irish folk music. I've spent the last 20 years in the trifecta between these three, leaving occasionally for different input.</li>
<li>I've been fortunate to study at the renowned jazz conservatory in Trondheim, followed by a stint in Copenhagen and then doing a master's in jazz and improvised music at the Norwegian Academy of Music in Oslo. My formal music education and the opportunities it has provided have been important, but traveling has been just as important (if not more). My first visits to the US and Ireland were humbling, to say the least. I knew I had a lot of work cut out for me coming back, and I still do. But the thrill of exploring bluegrass and Irish trad has stayed with me and given me the chance to work with some amazing musicians.</li>
<li>I've wanted to put out a solo album for some time, and as I've gotten older the stakes have felt higher. It would have to be a solid personal statement, and pay tribute to my musical roots. The idea to make two albums as my album debut seemed to be good, so I decided to make ""Rad"" and ""Trad"", the first being my own songs and tunes and the second being my take on music that has been important to me.</li>
<li>I started working on these albums in 2018, and I'm finally about to wrap them up. My family relocated to rural Norway, and I decided it was time to give this a shot. Armed with two guitars, a banjo, dobro, fiddle, mandolin, cello, Irish flute, rhodes, piano, double bass and my voice in addition to some studio gear, I set up a space where I could work on this project at home. Touring and working on other projects as well as expanding my family (again!) has definitely prolonged the process some, but now the finish line is on the horizon.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's what you're helping me paying for:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've recorded the albums on my own time and dime, but it's time to get some fresh ears to finish them off. The funds I receive will go towards mixing and mastering, cover art, pressing and distribution. </li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There are some cool perks in exchange for your support. This will be my solo debut, but I have nine other albums with groups where I've composed and been heavily creatively invested. You can order my new albums together with any of these albums. You can also buy the albums together with skype lessons or solo performances.</span></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By pre-ordering the albums now you'll be part of creating a positive boost for the last inning of this process for me. </p>
<ul>
<li>These albums represent a highly personal statement from me. Initially an outsider to the trad and bluegrass world, I think that there is something positive and unique about this music.</li>
<li>I have released many records on my own label, Just For The Records, and have the know how to do it and do it properly.</li>
<li>Will this album change the world? Or bluegrass music as we know it? Highly unlikely. But I will be so bold to claim that some of the music isn't like anything you've heard before.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are some risks to putting this campaign out now. I initially wanted to do it after doing the vocals properly, but by doing it now it will give me a good challenge to do it right and wrap it up before the end of summer.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've worked hard to get the project this far, and even though the singing might be the last and biggest hurdle, I've set up a provincial vocal booth and it works well!

<li>I hope to have the albums ready by fall 2020, but I don't want to set a definite date now. The most important thing for me now is to focus on quality and make sure that it gets to the place I want it to be.</li>

Touring and working on other projects as well as expanding my family (again!) has definitely prolonged the process some, but now the finish line is on the horizon.


What We Need & What You Get
Here's what you're helping me paying for:

I've recorded the albums on my own time and dime, but it's time to get some fresh ears to finish them off. The funds I receive will go towards mixing and mastering, cover art, pressing and distribution. 
There are some cool perks in exchange for your support. This will be my solo debut, but I have nine other albums with groups where I've composed and been heavily creatively invested. You can order my new albums together with any of these albums. You can also buy the albums together with skype lessons or solo performances.


The Impact
By pre-ordering the albums now you'll be part of creating a positive boost for the last inning of this process for me. 

These albums represent a highly personal statement from me. Initially an outsider to the trad and bluegrass world, I think that there is something positive and unique about this music.
I have released many records on my own label, Just For The Records, and have the know how to do it and do it properly.
Will this album change the world? Or bluegrass music as we know it? Highly unlikely. But I will be so bold to claim that some of the music isn't like anything you've heard before.


Risks & Challenges
There are some risks to putting this campaign out now. I initially wanted to do it after doing the vocals properly, but by doing it now it will give me a good challenge to do it right and wrap it up before the end of summer.

I've worked hard to get the project this far, and even though the singing might be the last and biggest hurdle, I've set up a provincial vocal booth and it works well! I've started recording some vocals, and realize that the road to completion will be paved with blood, sweat, tears and curse words. But come hell or high water I'll pave it!
I hope to have the albums ready by fall 2020, but I don't want to set a definite date now. The most important thing for me now is to focus on quality and make sure that it gets to the place I want it to be.

<p>Mykel was born an entertainer. From a young age he loved captivating people whether in small groups or a large audience. By channeling Freddie Mercury, Selena and Justin Timberlake, Mykel knows what it takes to entertain a crowd and leave them wanting more.</p>
<p>Mykel discovered he had a knack for musical comedy by creating a song titled, “Skinny Chick.” After receiving very positive reviews and encouragement to create more songs, he figured, “hey, maybe I have something here.” With his new found talent, Mykel set up to begin his musical comedy career. By performing small shows around Orlando, FL and launching his music online, Mykel began to form a following in Orlando.</p>
<p>In order to show the world what he’s got, Mykel has to get some music videos out there. After gathering a group of dedicated artists/friends, Mykel knows it’s time to launch his videos.</p>
<p>Of course, videos cost money… in fact, we’re coming to realize EVERYTHING costs money. With your help, Mykel’s dream can come true. Wouldn’t it be nice to one day sit back and say, “hey, I helped Mykel start his career and look where he is at now.”</p>
<p>Without donors, none of this could be possible; we are working hard to bring costs down and will make sure we put your money to good use.</p>

<h3>How I Got Here...</h3>
<div>
<p>My name is Marqueal Jordan (saxophonist, vocalist, composer, producer and bandleader). I have been performing professionally for nearly 30 years, most significantly since moving to Chicago in 1995. Over the last 10 years, I have toured with Brian Culbertson and performed with legendary artists such as Buddy Guy, Larry Graham, Jill Scott, KRS-One and Marcus Miller. In addition, I was co-leader and the frontman for the Chicago Funk/Rock band Fat Time and a frequent collaborator with Chicago-based artist/producer, DJ I.N.C.</p>
<p>In October 2013, I released my solo debut album, Catalyst. It was a well-received introduction to the Contemporary/Smooth Jazz genre and it showed fans that I was more than a sideman in a great touring band. In the following years I promoted and performed in support of my album while simultaneously touring with Culbertson. Over time, I realized that in order to have the success I desired, I needed to focus solely on my recording career, improve my artistry and build my brand. Consequently, I made plans to do that. I began recording tracks for Intention &amp; Purpose in early 2018 and left Culbertson's band after the culmination of the Colors Of Love tour.</p>
<p>Intention &amp; Purpose is scheduled for release in February 2019. It is the next progression of my artistry and I am excited to share it with you.</p>
</div>
<h3>So, Here's The Dilly...</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The recording for Intention &amp; Purpose is nearly complete, and I learned with Catalyst that the real work for an album is what happens AFTER the last note is ""put on wax"". This campaign is focused completely on that.</p>
<p>I am raising $15,000 to help with the costs of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixing &amp; Mastering...to make this music sound amazing</li>
<li>CD Replication...yes there will be CDs made lol</li>
<li>PR/Marketing &amp; Radio Promotion...to ensure that as many music lovers as possible know about, can easily access and enjoy this album</li>
</ul>
<p>Every dollar contributed here, whether $5 or $50k, will go directly to those costs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Power Of Your Support</h3>
<p>Simply put, your contribution to Intention &amp; Purpose can determine the success level and reach of this project. A great or good record that is never heard doesn't exist. With my debut CD, even with limited knowledge of the industry and a radio promotion campaign that was launched 10 months after its initial release, Catalyst made a considerable impact and still gets current spins on Music Choice and other radio stations. Applying the positives and the hard lessons learned, I am confident that this second album will be infinitely more successful.</p>
<p>Also, besides the great feeling you will get from supporting an independent artist, you will receive something tangible for your investment. There are a list of perks that you can choose from based on your level of contribution. Take a look and determine what best fits your level of financial commitment, ya dig...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>You can't contribute? That's cool...</h3>
<p>However, what you can do is share this campaign with your peeps and/or on your social media campaigns. Word of mouth marketing and third party endorsements are wonderful things!</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for your contributions and positive energy!!! If you have any direct questions for me, please do not hesitate to hit me up.</p>
<p>Much Love,</p>

<h3>What the --? </h3>
<p>Who hasn't dreamed of being a rock star? Well, one rock star's dream has come true then been repeatedly swiped from him. Mike Hadge, of the Mike Hadge Trio, has led the world's most underground (see: unpopular) band through the ringer, only to see it crumble time and time again. Some consider it his own fault but no, it isn't. </p>
<p>Fortunately, the good people at FringeNYC have selected <em>T</em><em>he Mike Hadge Trio's 7th Reunion Concert</em> to be part of their glorious festival. Unfortunately, the band lost all their money/equipment/staff in a rock-paper-scissors wager and need YOUR help to put up the musical concert event of the century! </p>
<p>Mike Hadge (also head songwriter for off-Broadway twin variety act The Rescignos) has written over 130 original songs in his lifetime - a body of work that would make Gershwin punch a wall in frustration - and only wants to share some of them with the world. Finally, he has gotten the (7th) opportunity to do so. Won't you help spread music/happiness to the world? </p>
<p>Your contributions are appreciated. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to put up a successful indie rock concert, one thing's for sure important - instruments, publicity, insurance, sound equipment and staff. Okay, that's like 7 things, but you get the point. Our budget has been worked out to the penny, and as much as we'd love to bang on some cardboard boxes and strum some rubber bands held together by rusty twine, it probably wouldn't make for a great show (Or would it? Hmmm). </p>
<p>The best part? PERKS that YOU GET for contributing! EPs, Greatest Hits albums, signed band posters, even become an honorary past member of the band! It's all possible and it's all for you! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Okay, so no orphans will be fed, no diseases will be cured, no community centers will be saved from big corporations. There are absolutely better causes for your money to go to but...uh...actually yeah, donate your money to those causes. Do not donate any money to us! (wink) (reverse psychology) </div>

<p>After just 3 days since the track was put up on YouTube, set to still images of the twins to provide a basic visual backing to the music, more than 2,000 independent views have been registered.  It has also been shared around social media extensively, with many people commenting on how impressive this first effort from the youngsters is.  Comments such as:</p> <ul> <li>""This is a well written tune with stunning vocals.""</li> <li>""I had instant goose bumps. I was just going to listen to it and keep working.. But I had to stop and just listen...""</li> <li><span><span>""Love it! I am no way affiliated with these girls, but I came across the song on Facebook and am in love!""</span></span></li> </ul> <p>Such a positive response in such a short time has been overwhelming for the girls, and people are sharing it around to their own circle of friends.  So where to from here? </p>
</div><h3>What We Need</h3><p>With this huge response in such little time, the need for an official music video has arrived.  The creation of a professionally produced music video will bring this single the attention it deserves.  If such a flood of interest so early in its release has manifested via the current 'still images' music video, imagine the response when the official music video is finally released, featuring the young song-writers in a professional visual medium</p><div>
So, to make this happen we need your help.  The cost of a professional music video is very high, and WAY out of reach for the budget we have.  After sourcing a fantastic videographer, we have arrived at a figure we need to raise to make it happen: </div><ul> <li>$2,500. </li> <li>Includes all time and prep for the full video shoot</li>
<li>All necessary editing and rendering of the footage</li>
<li>Final production and release of the music video</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Given the response so far, we believe the creation, release and spread of an official music video for 'Whispering Waves' will bring the girls up to a professional standard for promoting themselves and their amazing music.  It also gives them the freedom to have creative control over their work and the way it is represented in their music video.</p><p>Important results to the production of this music video:</p><ul> <li>It will give the young song-writers a professional presentation of their work.</li> <li>Their potential for opportunities in the music scene will be much stronger.</li> <li>They will have full creative control over their future as song-writers and performers if we keep things independently produced. </li>
</ul> <div> <h3>Conclusion</h3> <p> Katie and Emilie Graham are truly talented emerging artists.  Providing people like this with help to get their talent exposed to the world will give them the confidence and encouragement to further their abilities and develop their craft in a more professional, positive way.</p>
<p>The song-writing ability of these girls is something to behold - truly a Producer's dream come true.  The time is ripe to give them a much needed boost to get this incredible music to the masses.  A music video is the most powerful way to do this.</p>

 The ImpactGiven the response so far, we believe the creation, release and spread of an official music video for 'Whispering Waves' will bring the girls up to a professional standard for promoting themselves and their amazing music.  It also gives them the freedom to have creative control over their work and the way it is represented in their music video.Important results to the production of this music video: It will give the young song-writers a professional presentation of their work. Their potential for opportunities in the music scene will be much stronger. They will have full creative control over their future as song-writers and performers if we keep things independently produced. 
  Conclusion  Katie and Emilie Graham are truly talented emerging artists.  Providing people like this with help to get their talent exposed to the world will give them the confidence and encouragement to further their abilities and develop their craft in a more professional, positive way.
The song-writing ability of these girls is something to behold - truly a Producer's dream come true.  The time is ripe to give them a much needed boost to get this incredible music to the masses.  A music video is the most powerful way to do this.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong><em>This is a CALL TO ACTION since we only get 45 DAYS to make this project a reality!  </em></strong>Pledged funds raised will be used to bring the music to life.  It will be dedicated to my mother, who is currently battling breast cancer.  She is doing great, but it has instilled in me a sense of urgency to get this music out <em>this</em> year.  Family, friends, and fans have asked for me to do a Christmas CD for three years, and I feel it's time for new music, and for it to come out <em>this</em> Christmas. <strong> <br/></strong></p>

<p>I hope to continue my musical journey I embarked upon last year during the upcoming months by recording some additional tracks that will mark the release of my new studio Album for 2013.  It is very exciting for me to see the time, energy and work that I have invested coming to fruition.  I have evolved so much personally and as a songwriter since the release of my first album in 2003.</p>
<p>Since last year I had the great privilege and honour to work with well established producers in the music industry, Jan Linder-Koda, Marty Rifkin, Barry Keenan and Sydney Alston to get this project off the ground. Jan has a long track record in the music industry for producing songs and working to develop artists that rise to the top. <br/><br/> I want nothing more than to share my story with the world through my music, inspire others especially those that have disabilities to believe in themselves and to follow their dreams.<br/><br/> I have a rare form of dwarfism called Kniest Dysplasia; there are less than 200 people worldwide with this condition. Growing up with Kniest can be quite challenging at times, full of various surgeries and many months in hospital throughout my life.

<p><strong>Your Smile, Your Lips, Your Poison, Your Kiss. I Know Better.</strong></p>
<p><i>Waiting, watching, hoping, always the same. Wishing that this time will be different. Maybe this time, it will be more than the short summer it always is. Maybe she can be more than minor. Or maybe, she can turn and walk away. But she sees him, he smiles, she opens the door. One day, she'll break this cycle. </i></p>
<p>We are so excited to share our new record with you! Call it a concept album. Call it a story. Call it what you will. All we can say is that this record will be the culmination of devoting our lives to playing music. It will be unlike anything else we've done. Obviously, (since this is Indiegogo afterall) we need your help!</p>
<p>How about  15 more seconds of your time, for a brief introduction and super-short pitch?          </p>
<p>We are Surreal Nation (Paul, Nikki, Jackson, Gene, and Kevin), an indie rock band from Delaware. Paul and Nikki formed as an alt-folk duo back in 2014. The band's name is a merge of their last names (Surowiec and Nation). Jackson joined us in 2015, followed by Gene in late 2016, and Kevin in 2017. As the band grew, our sound progressed from an alt-folk duo into a full size indie rock band. This will be our third EP. </p>
<p>Hey there! You're still reading this. Must mean you're ready for some details. Here they are...</p>
<h3>What we need and why</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>We need $3000.00 USD. This money is going to recording a new record, and all of the associated costs, which we'll break down. We've raised a good deal of our budget. We need this last bit and we humbly ask for your help in getting there. </li>
<li>For you non-musicians, here is how recording breaks down financially, and why we need the amount we do.</li>
<li>First you have to track. Which means playing your songs, and getting them recorded. </li>
<li>This <u>starts</u> at $35.00/hour. </li>
<li>After tracking, comes mixing and then mastering. (which is basically editing).  </li>
<li>After that, you're leave the studio with a .wav and mp3 files of your songs. That's it.</li>
<li>Now, you need to do two things with those files.  The first is to get them onto Itunes, Amazon, etc. (You have to pay a company to be the intermediary to do this. The second is to get the music files pressed onto CD/Vinyl/etc.</li>
<li>We're thinking that this will be another $500.00-$600.00</li>
<li>Next, you have to register the songs with the US copyright office. (It's the government so you KNOW that costs money)</li>
<li>Congratulations! You now have a garage full of CDs that need to be marketed and sold.  There are costs associated with mailing CDs to radio stations, promoters etc. Having a reputable company promote your music to radio stations has a cost of around $2000.00.</li>
<li>So as you can see, this is a lengthy and expensive process. </li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Helping to fund this project makes you a part of the creative process.</li>
<li>You get to take part in sharing our new music with the world.</li>
<li>Our last EP was played on both Internet and terrestrial radio. It led to us having a TV appearance and finding success regionally. That EP was funded with our own personal money, which meant that we were limited in how much we were able to spend. </li>
<li>Imagine how much further we can take this record, if we work together to meet our financial goal!</li>
</ul>

Waiting, watching, hoping, always the same. Wishing that this time will be different. Maybe this time, it will be more than the short summer it always is. Maybe she can be more than minor. Or maybe, she can turn and walk away. But she sees him, he smiles, she opens the door. One day, she'll break this cycle. 
We are so excited to share our new record with you! Call it a concept album. Call it a story. Call it what you will. All we can say is that this record will be the culmination of devoting our lives to playing music. It will be unlike anything else we've done. Obviously, (since this is Indiegogo afterall) we need your help!
How about  15 more seconds of your time, for a brief introduction and super-short pitch?          
We are Surreal Nation (Paul, Nikki, Jackson, Gene, and Kevin), an indie rock band from Delaware. Paul and Nikki formed as an alt-folk duo back in 2014. The band's name is a merge of their last names (Surowiec and Nation). Jackson joined us in 2015, followed by Gene in late 2016, and Kevin in 2017. As the band grew, our sound progressed from an alt-folk duo into a full size indie rock band. This will be our third EP. 
Hey there! You're still reading this. Must mean you're ready for some details. Here they are...
What we need and why

We need $3000.00 USD. This money is going to recording a new record, and all of the associated costs, which we'll break down. We've raised a good deal of our budget. We need this last bit and we humbly ask for your help in getting there. 
For you non-musicians, here is how recording breaks down financially, and why we need the amount we do.
First you have to track. Which means playing your songs, and getting them recorded. 
This starts at $35.00/hour. 
After tracking, comes mixing and then mastering. (which is basically editing).  
After that, you're leave the studio with a .wav and mp3 files of your songs. That's it.
Now, you need to do two things with those files.  The first is to get them onto Itunes, Amazon, etc. (You have to pay a company to be the intermediary to do this. The second is to get the music files pressed onto CD/Vinyl/etc.
We're thinking that this will be another $500.00-$600.00
Next, you have to register the songs with the US copyright office. (It's the government so you KNOW that costs money)
Congratulations! You now have a garage full of CDs that need to be marketed and sold.  There are costs associated with mailing CDs to radio stations, promoters etc. Having a reputable company promote your music to radio stations has a cost of around $2000.00.
So as you can see, this is a lengthy and expensive process. 

The Impact

Helping to fund this project makes you a part of the creative process.
You get to take part in sharing our new music with the world.
Our last EP was played on both Internet and terrestrial radio. It led to us having a TV appearance and finding success regionally. That EP was funded with our own personal money, which meant that we were limited in how much we were able to spend. 
Imagine how much further we can take this record, if we work together to meet our financial goal!


Risks & Challenges 
This is our first crowdfunding campaign and we are very excited about it. Our biggest challenge is going to be getting casual fans to take action and contribute. (Transforming ""likes"" into contributions).

<h3>11 new songs on our 11th CD. </h3>
<h3>First off we just want to say thank you for the years of support our great fans and friends have given us. It has been an incredible ride though clubs, states, countries and lots and lots of shows.</h3>
<p><strong>Your pledges are going directly to the CD.</strong> </p>
<p>The funds will go to paying for the 3 mixing days @ $1,200 a day, manufacturing 1,000 Cd's @ $1,400 and the radio promotion of ""Unraveled"" which will run about $5,000. This important becuase without it no one will ever hear this CD outside of our fans. Every cent of the pledges are going to the CD. We truly believe this is the best recording we have ever made. It is raw, emotional and true to Two Tons. ‬</p>
<p>We have been so blessed to be able to make a living for our families playing music and want to continue recording not only for them but for everyone who has dreamed of being in a band. ""I remember the first time I played live, it was a singer/songwriter night at Yakafritzes Coffee House in Nacodoches, Tx. I was so scared I couldn’t finish my song, and left the stage. It took 10 years before I tried again. To think that I have been on the Grand Ole Opry, tour Europe and play over 200 shows a year still makes me smile."" Kevin Geil said.</p>
<p>“Unraveled” is a back to basics approach to recording. It’s just Geil, Brian Duarte on guitar, Paul Ward on drums and Jake “Sidecar” Marchese on upright bass they are amazingly talented players! Produced by our longtime friend Lloyd Maines and engineered by Pat Manski at The Zone in Dripping Springs. We have financed $5,000 our selfs and now asking for help to finish it up. We are needing to raise an additional $10,000. We hope to get “Unraveled” to #1 on the Americana Music Charts, our last release hit #4.</p>

  always count on your support so far. But this time we really need additional

  plan for transportation on this tour failed. We are working now on plan B and
  C, which are both significantly more expensive. Regardless if this campaign
  reaches its goal or not, we will still do this tour (unless other unexpected

  us cover, at least partly, the now increased costs of travelling and

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In late 2016 I was thinking about my time in doublethink while hanging out with my four-year old son. I had the thought that my son would not really know about what it was like for me being in a band like doublethink and going on the adventures that we did. I wished, at that time, that I could hand him something concise yet comprehensive that covered the band's career.</p>
<p>The thought stayed with me and I envisioned making him a mix CD when he became old enough to appreciate it. But come on, a mix CD?! That's hardly good enough to encapsulate the entire history of doublethink and what it means to me.</p>
<p>And you!</p>
<p>That's why I'm starting this campaign to produce an anthology of doublethink's music, including a 20-page booklet filled with pictures and personal accounts from the band members themselves.</p>
<p>The anthology will be called ""Keep The Wolves At Bay"", which is the name of an unreleased track that will be included in the anthology.</p>
<p>The design of the booklet, the tracklist, and the personal accounts from the band members themselves are all totally complete. I simply need the funds to mass produce the physical copies!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get &amp; What We Need</h3>
<p>This 2-disc collection features music from doublethink's entire career and includes songs played by all the various lineups. The first disc is made up of the best of the songs that were commercially released in one way or another, while the second disc is made up of unreleased songs, demos, live tracks, acoustic versions, etc. To see the full track list, <a href=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,f_auto,w_695/v1499729215/fvp0z2ebn01tyjzetkae.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">click here</a>!</p>
<p>I am not intending to make any profit from this campaign. The $700.00 I am looking to raise will go to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duplication of 100 physical copies of the 2-disc set</li>
<li>Shipping costs of getting the copies to the buyers (that's you!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I am anticipating that 100 copies will suffice, but if more are needed I can always increase that number. Basically, the more money raised the more copies there will be!</p>
<p>However, if more money is raised than needed to buy the copies that have been ordered, the surplus funds will go to other future doublethink projects that the band and myself have been considering.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ultimately, I am in this for three people:</p>
<ol>
<li>Myself</li>
<li>My son</li>
<li>All the doublethink fans</li>
</ol>
<p>This is (and has been!) an absolute labor of love. I am only looking to capture the moments and memories of doublethink's history. That includes my time with the group as well as the time after I left. This will truly be the best way I can think of to honor what I think, in my humble opinion, is a terrific rock and roll band.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'll be honest with you: even if I don't raise the $700.00 I'm looking for, I am still going to make this happen. Any money raised will go straight into defraying the costs of the project from my own personal finances. So really, there are no risks at all with this campaign.<strong> If you contribute your $12.00 you will get a copy of the anthology, guaranteed. </strong>All copies will be mailed out via USPS as soon as they are ready to be shipped.</p>
<p><i>NOTE: If you are not living in the continental United States, please anticipate delays in getting your order. You may also have to contribute a little extra to cover higher shipping costs.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are a doublethink fan but for some reason are not interested in this anthology set, the best thing you can do is spread the word to other doublethink fans you know to make sure they have the opportunity to get their hands on this awesome collection!</p>

afford the burden of cost or do so themselves because of the complexity of the
rules and laws.  This causes worry and anxiety with them and is a
detriment not only to one’s rights, but to one’s health and soul. 
Capitulation is a bad feeling to ones liberty, freedom and peace of mind. 
I am currently without resources to seek justice and feel that stress. <b>The solution?</b>  After you
read my personal situation and campaign here to alleviate my current problem, I
will strive to solve that problem for many others in the future.  The
solution or <b>VISION </b>follows my next plea for your
compassion and contribution (Scroll Down).</p>
<p><b><u>My Current Situation and Need – The PLEA for Help</u></b></p>
<p>I used to be an engineer and visionary entrepreneur working on
some big projects to bring to life to provide society with some good living
choices and recreation, I used to be working on some novels too, I used to be a
catamaran sailor, bicyclist and mountain hiker.  I used to be engaged with
life and living and loving it.  That is, until I suffered a personal
injury due to other’s negligence which changed my life forever: A blunt force
closed head injury which, although it left my intelligence intact for the most
part, it diminished many other aspects of my life:  Things such as rock
solid memory and recall, focus, energy, balance, coordination, organization, etc.  The
kind of things one needs to successfully navigate a fulfilling life and a
sustaining career or job.  After recovery from post concussion syndrome,
knowing that I had not returned to my “old self”, I still tried to make it work
as the doctors said “get used to the new you”.  I have become the
proverbial Absent-Minded-Professor!  I tried for five years to work in a
career which normally should have been easy for me to do but could not handle
the work load needed to succeed.  Memory, focus, disorganization and other
deficits due to my injury prevented it.  After going broke and being
“technically homeless”, save for the support from family for shelter, I had to
apply for and obtained Social Security Disability status.  I can tell
everyone that this stipend, although appreciated at this time, is not enough
for one to live on for the long term without other help.  I hope to get
off of that system as soon as I can someway, someday, somehow.  I am sure
that if you help me with this funding drive, I can and will once I have my day in Court.</p>
<p>My way to do so is to seek <b>JUSTICE </b>for the injury due to other’s
negligence.  I had an attorney for that purpose but <u>in my opinion (and that of others)</u> he mishandled the entire situation,
did not act properly as my fiduciary, did not properly serve the principle
defendant, failed to follow my directives regarding the secondary defendant and
failed to use due diligence:  All the while telling me to not worry and
that all was under control.  He even failed to impeach a witness, upon my
directive, who perjured herself where direct evidence is available to
definitively prove that.  His presentations are still unknown to me as I
was not informed or present at hearings or strategy meetings and he is still
holding back my full case file, which is my right to have according to other
attorneys.  Once I obtain these files by Court Order, I feel that I will
learn of even more malpractice.  To cut to the point, he failed to bring
the case to a rightful trial for a rightful resolution and award for
loss.  I did not get a dime due to the negligence-caused-injury. 
Malpractice of law, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and other
issues will be enumerated in the complaint against him and his law firm. 
This law firm is insured for such malpractice and may choose to settle but even
if their insurance company suggests this, they have an overriding right to go
to trial so I need to be prepared and need representation to do so. </p>
<p><u>Here is another interesting point of contention with him.</u>  Although the
attorney here enjoys a good reputation and standing, he failed on multiple
levels with my case as is evident in my opinion and that of others. 
Another attorney I asked to represent me for the legal malpractice case had
contacted him and asked ‘why he did not serve and summon the primary defendant
into court.’  I was told by that attorney that my attorney, as my
fiduciary and an officer of the Court, had stated the defendant(s) were
deceased!  They are alive and well in South Carolina!!!  This is
deception in my opinion and just not right.  Is he trying to sabotage my
effort to bring my rightful case to Court?  I broke past my anxiety
somewhat and, just in the nick-of-time, I have purchased a Court Index Number
in March and will be serving Summons with Notice into Court next month against
the defendants.  I have “bought some time” now and once I feel that my
legal funding campaign is moving forward with the help of many, I will be
retaining an attorney to represent me on an hourly basis.  A few attorneys
told me that the budget for this case will be high.  They all say that the
legal malpractice is very evident and not a large hurdle to show or prove, but
that I must then also re-present the original injury case and show that it
could have led to a successful award for loss.  It will, but it takes
expensive expert witnesses to do so, and a contingency based representation is
not possible unless some attorney steps forward with some altruism: therefore, <b>I NEED YOUR HELP</b>.  Also,
it is not easy to find an attorney willing to go after another attorney for
such a Just Cause.  Many know each other and that creates a
conflict.  I do have a couple in mind but their budget figures are
high:  Between $55,000 and $80,000 USD.  Attorney representation is
vital now.  I have no chance to self-represent in a trial.  My verbal
expression skills are diminished and along with focus, organization deficits
and the resulting anxiety, I would probably “short circuit” if I tried to do
this myself even though I know the facts.  I would fail. </p>
<p><b>Although I do hope to encourage donors to help me reach a goal
of about $75,000 just in case, I am going to start this campaign with a goal of
$40,000 and hope and pray for more </b>or that I can find some
less expensive experts or work out arrangements with some such that expense
would be paid in part with remainder upon collection of an award. <b>Note:</b>  any funds in excess
of those needed to pursue this access to the courts will be used toward the
formation of the <b>JUSTICE
LEAGUE SUPPORT FUND </b>charity
fund (my VISION, see below). I
will form this charity fund once I can breathe with some ease after hiring an
attorney for the above situation and then have time to do all the acrobatics
one has to do to start such a fund in the State and Federal levels.  I
will need help with that too and will be seeking like-minded concerned citizens
to join me in that adventure.  I have already started to compile knowledge
and advice regarding its setup and have developed a draft of the model it will
operate on.  If for an unforeseen reason I cannot move forward with that
worthy <b>VISION</b>, then
I will PAY THE EXCESS FUNDS FORWARD to others in need or donate to a worthy
charity.</p>
<p><b><i>Oh… and it is my BIRTHDAY on May 5</i></b><b><i><sup>th</sup></i></b><b><i>, so I will consider all
contributions to the campaign in May to also be a sentimental or gracious
Birthday Wish too!!! PLEASE celebrate with me.</i></b></p>
<p>Contributions will be used for expenses such as court filings,
depositions, transcripts, attorney hourly fees, economist fee, expert witness
fees, and travel costs for any witnesses, including that of the original
primary defendant who is out of State. excess funds will be used for
charity.  That is, used to fund and start my long term VISION… the JUSTICE
LEAGUE SUPPORT FUND (JLSF) so others may be aided.</p>
<p>As a final plea, <b>HELP
ME to HELP MYSELF </b>with this
Just Cause.  Donations of any size are appreciated.  <u>Help also by
spreading the word by sharing this page with others</u> who you feel may be
charitable in nature and can hold passion for the larger future plan as

<p><b>Now, the long term vision: </b> To form a charity fund as a
501(c)(3) and have it administered to seek contributions through Indiegogo.com
and through the normal campaigns and outreach to fortunate people, foundations
and companies for the purpose of giving so that the JLSF can then give to needy
persons who have Just Causes to <u>rightfully

System for non-criminal causes for action, that is Civil Court action so that
they can believe that Justice also applies to them and that they may seek some
PEACE OF MIND by at least having the chance to be heard or defended in issues
that affect their rights.</p>
<p>To this end, I have also started an Indiegogo campaign to
solicit needed start-up funds to create this Charity Fund.  It is called
the <b>JUSTICE LEAGUE SUPPORT

<p><b>Our Goal:</b></p>
<p>Over the years, opbmusic has laid a strong foundation for a
successful concert series. With more than 200 successful opbmusic sessions
under our belt, we are excited about the opportunity to grow the sessions into
a series and to place a greater spotlight on Portland’s incredibly talented
local artist community. We cannot do this without your support. <br/></p><p>opbmusic has
received a grant from PBS Digital Studios to produce the Stagepass concert and
video series. PBS will match up to $20,000 of the total amount raised during
this campaign; a total that we feel is necessary to make this production shine.
100 percent of funds raised during this campaign will be dedicated to helping
cover the bands’ costs and producing high quality videos.
No money from this campaign will go to OPB, opbmusic or PBS Digital Studios.
Additionally, this campaign is funded independently of OPB’s member
contributions.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Three Ways to
Support:</b></p>

this campaign a success! We are excited for this concert series and look forward to seeing everyone each month at the show! Don't forget to follow us on social media to receive updates when we've released the show videos and interviews.****Update: We'll be updating all concert information on opbmusic.org from here on out. You can also subscribe to our YouTube channel for a notification each time a Stagepass video is posted.Welcome to opbmusic Stagepass – a unique opportunity for you
to celebrate and support the vibrancy of Portland’s thriving music scene by
getting up close to your favorite Northwest bands.
Stagepass is a new concert series that not only gives you an
immersive experience in the Portland music community, but your support and participation
will help amazing local bands gain exposure to a worldwide audience through
highly produced post-concert videos. 
The Stagepass Experience
Each month, Stagepass tickets holders will enjoy a special,
intimate concert from Portland-area artists and bands. All concerts will be
filmed by talented videographers and edited together with a behind-the-scenes
band interview. The resulting high-energy video will be available online to
enjoy and share with friends. 
Stagepass Details:

Tickets are sold as a series package - individual show tickets will not be available.

There will be one concert per month.
The Stagepass series will last for nine months.
Concerts will be held at Mississippi Studios.
At least one band will perform
per show. Many shows will also feature an opening band.

All shows will be filmed with HD video. 

Stagepass Roster:


May 10: Modern Kin, withJust Lions 


June 11: Black Prairie, with St. Even (NOTE: Tickets to this concert will be sold through Indiegogo only - there are no tickets sales at the door. If you purchase your ticket after 5pm on 6/11, your Indiegogo confirmation will be your entrance to the show.)

Our Goal:
Over the years, opbmusic has laid a strong foundation for a
successful concert series. With more than 200 successful opbmusic sessions
under our belt, we are excited about the opportunity to grow the sessions into
a series and to place a greater spotlight on Portland’s incredibly talented
local artist community. We cannot do this without your support. opbmusic has
received a grant from PBS Digital Studios to produce the Stagepass concert and
video series. PBS will match up to $20,000 of the total amount raised during
this campaign; a total that we feel is necessary to make this production shine.
100 percent of funds raised during this campaign will be dedicated to helping
cover the bands’ costs and producing high quality videos.
No money from this campaign will go to OPB, opbmusic or PBS Digital Studios.
Additionally, this campaign is funded independently of OPB’s member
contributions.
Three Ways to
Support:
Buy tickets: The most
beneficial way you can support Stagepass, and this project, is

You will also notice in our perks list to the right that we
have additional tickets options in larger packages: a signed instrument from a
participating band, dinner before a concert and an overnight hotel stay.

you can’t attend the shows, but would still like to support this project, we would love a donation. To contribute financially only, click
the large “contribute now’” button on

a need to make a trip to Johannesburg, South Africa.   On this mission my goal is to reach out and help as
many who need and want it. I want to spread the peaceful word of God as far as
I can and to do this I need some help. 
I am reaching out to you, my family, friends, coworkers and others,
asking for some financial assistance in helping me reach my desire to help
others in a country that so badly needs it.  Every little bit will help and will be so appreciated.  I assure you your monies will be well
spent and I hope that you find some peace in knowing that you also took part in
reaching out and helping so many others find their inner peace and strength.  I want the ones I can reach to feel as
complete as I do, because  giving
my life to God, was the most important and best decision I have ever made. It
did not make my life perfect or problem free, but it did change who I am
forever. I could not imagine facing life’s challenges on my own without God in
my life.  This is my hope and dream
for others.  This trip is organized through my church, Crossroads Community Church, Cincinnati, OH.  www.crossroads.netIf you can't contribute finacially you can still help!  Please share this and help me get to South Africa.  THANK YOU SO MUCH!Fell free to use the Indiegogo share tools!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Linda Stroback-Hocking. For nearly 30 years, my
husband, Bob Hocking and I have been the owner/manager/collectors of Zimmy’s
Restaurant in Bob Dylan’s hometown of Hibbing, MN. In the course of our many
years, as our collections of local Bob Dylan-related memorabilia have
increased, we have become the unofficial Bob Dylan museum in our small town.<br/><br/><p>Earlier this year, Zimmy’s, like many small businesses in
our area, was confronted with an unforeseen tax burden. Because our many
attempts to set up a monthly payment plan were denied, we were forced to close
on March 6<sup>th</sup>, 2014. With your help, we can resurrect our restaurant,
and continue to serve as a home base for both our many loyal local customers
and for those Dylan pilgrims around the world.</p>
<p>We always tried to make our restaurant more than a
restaurant. In many ways, we were like a Bob Dylan welcome center. For the
thousands of worldwide Dylan fans who came through our doors, we have provided
a home base from which to explore the town of Hibbing, including, but not
limited to, its Bob Dylan connection. We are rooted in celebrating and
preserving the importance of the Iron Range and its influence on Bob’s work.
Zimmy’s was a place where both locals and outsiders felt at home. We succeeded
in creating an atmosphere where patrons could comfortably spend hours in
conversation. We took pride in our menu, serving “exquisite local cuisine” and
creating culinary events for our local patrons like special wine, beer and
whiskey food pairing evenings. But, in many ways, our food and drink merely
provided the means to keep people fueled for further conversation, camaraderie
and connection.</p>
<p>For many years, our historic trolley station building on
Howard Street has been the hub for the annual Dylan Days celebration in
Hibbing. Hundreds of musicians, artists, and Dylan fans have performed on our
stage and formed lifelong connections with both the town and the people they
met at Zimmy’s. We have hosted local and touring musicians, exhibited and
celebrated many local artists, and have even served as the stage for local
theater productions.</p>
<p>Our extensive Dylan memorabilia collection, which we’d love
to keep local, and our stories have been featured in countless books (including
the official <i>Bob Dylan Scrapbook</i>),
museum exhibits (including The Grammy Museum, The Experience Music Project, and
the Weisman Art Museum), and films (including Martin Scorcese’s <i>No
Direction Home</i>). We were deeply flattered
when author Steven Heine called Zimmy’s “The Vatican of the church of
Dylanology,”</p>
<p>We will need at least $200,000 to reopen Zimmy’s. This money
will purchase the restaurant building and its contents, and will secure the
Zimmy’s DBA name. Our perks are for both locals and those fans that want to be
a part of this unique place, even if they will never make it to Hibbing. At the
top end of the spectrum, they include a few historic, one-of-a-kind pieces of
local, Dylan-related memorabilia.</p>
<p>If our goal is not reached, your contribution will go into
the DylanDaysHibbing non-profit account that will support the annual Dylan Days
celebration for years to come. In addition to prizes for songwriters and visual
artists, we as “dylandayshibbing” non-profit are creating a B.J. Rolfzen
scholarship for creative writing, in honor of Bob’s influential high school
English teacher.</p>
<p>If we are the unofficial Bob Dylan museum of Hibbing, we are
a living museum. In an increasingly fragmented society, even in small towns
like ours, we need local places to connect, converse, and feel welcome. It
could be said of many of our visitors that they came seeking Bob Dylan, but
they ended up finding Hibbing. As a visitor in one of our many guest books put
it: “So many people…so many memories, and only one place like Zimmy’s on Earth.
Maybe it’s the atmosphere, the people, or a longing for days gone by, but this
place feels like home.”</p>
<p>In 100 years, people will still be coming to Hibbing because
of the Bob Dylan connection—there is no doubting that. The question is: will
there be a place like Zimmy’s to welcome them? If you love Bob Dylan, Zimmy’s
or Hibbing, please consider donating to our campaign.</p>

<h3>Welcome to <a href=""http://www.twba.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"" title=""The Whole Bolivian Army's web headquarters"">The Whole Bolivian Army</a>'s ""Siren"" Campaign</h3>
<p>By participating in our first-ever crowd-funding campaign, you can play an integral part in what for us is a momentous occasion:</p>
<p>Next year, 2013, will mark the 20th birthday of The Whole Bolivian Army, and “Siren” will be our tenth (!) album.</p>
</div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the skinny:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need $2,000 to help us finish funding our album. A little over half of that ($1,100) will go toward CD duplication and digital distribution. The rest ($900) will go toward paying off part of our studio expenses (by the time we finish the album, we will have logged more than 90 studio hours at Elliott Bay Recording Co. in Seattle, WA).</li>
<li>We've put together several fun perks for anyone who wants to jump on board, including a CD delivered to your front door in time for Christmas, a DVD with videos of all nine songs, a thumb drive containing the entire TWBA catalogue (ten albums' worth of material), and VIP passes to the official ""Siren"" listening party in January.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, we'll still allocate all raised sums to the expenses mentioned above while making good on every perk. Anything raised over our goal will go toward re-releasing “Amnesty,” our 1999 album, which is currently out of print. Other projects are in the offing, as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If your budget is too tight to contribute at the moment, you can help in other important ways:</p>

<p>Our DC-based rock band has had a lot of fun sharing our music with the world since forming in late 2009. We've played a ton of shows ranging from house parties, bars, clubs and music festivals, and we've released a CD and a music video, which have gotten us featured on international music blogs and into radio rotation. We were voted as Washington, DC/Baltimore's Artist of the month by readers of the Deli Magazine and radio station DC 101 named our song, ""Soggy Ground,"" on their best of 2011 list. It's been non-stop and we are eternally grateful for all of your support to date! </p>
<p>Immediately after independently releasing our debut album a year ago, we began writing and road-testing new music at our concerts. We now feel ready to create a second album. We're asking for your support to professionally record and release our new songs. This time in a real studio and with a professional engineer/producer. </p>
<h2><strong>Help Us Escape from the Basement...And You Shall Be Rewarded</strong></h2>
<p>Our first album was entirely self-funded and recorded in a dark basement apartment near the National Zoo. With your assistance, our days of a sunless, subterranean existence will be numbered.</p>
<p>Our minimum target to be able to release the album is $3000 dollars. <span>By helping us reach our goal, you're helping cover some of the costs of recording, mixing, mastering, duplicating, distributing and marketing our new album</span>. However, we hope to exceed the minimum amount so we'll be able to get this release the attention it deserves by having a modest budget for marketing and touring, which will draw further attention to this release. With studio time running approximately $500 a day, it won't be cheap do it right. We have already re-invested thousands of dollars in band revenues and have funneled personal savings into equipment upgrades and vocal coaching to prepare for this moment. We need your help to close the funding gap.</p>
<div>
<p>Take a look at the list of cool stuff we're offering. In exchange for our artistic freedom, we'll reward you with sweet gifts and swag. Our offerings range from digital downloads of our new music to one-of-a-kind artwork by us.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our projected release date is January 2013. But many of you who support the project will have access to downloads prior to that time. </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>After we were approached and offered unfavorable terms by an LA record label in late 2011, we realized that signing a non-artist-friendly recording contract was not our only option to receive start-up funding in today's music industry. Technology has made it possible to internationally distribute a professionally produced album as an independent artist while maintaining 100% artistic control and keeping a larger percent of revenues. YOU can contribute any amount that you're comfortable with and we will hansomely reward you for doing so. </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Use your vocal cords and mutter the following words, ""Megaphone Barons."" Did anyone hear you? If not, repeat and increase volume until you get a response.  Please upload videos to youtube where you yell our band name during inappropriate times. Bonus points for doing it in weird contexts. Seriously, word of mouth is super important. Also, feel free to like us on facebook and share this by using Indiegogo's share tools in emails, on facebook, in twitter and other places within your sphere of influence on the interwebs.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for being a supporter of independent music at this very important time. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Common questions:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>I would LOVE to give this to a friend or family member as a gift. Can I gift an incentive?</strong><br/>YES! Spectacular idea. If you would like to support Megaphone Barons but want to give the reward to someone else as a gift, please go through the normal process of making a donation in your name. Then, when we reach out to you via e-mail to request additional information, please tell us who should receive the reward.</p>
<p><strong>Can I increase my pledge once it has been made?</strong><br/>YES! Once you donate to the campaign, you may want to change your incentive reward to a different one, or simply increase your pledge amount. To do so, please sign onto Indiegogo as usual. On our campaign page, you can enter a new amount, or choose a new incentive!</p>
<p><strong>Can I pledge for more than one incentive?</strong><br/>Absolutely! There is no limit to the amount you can pledge or number incentives you may receive <em>(""limited"" incentives excluded).</em></p>

Our music can always be found in our Bandcamp page.- Past crowdfunding experience""New Battles, without honor and humanity"" was the first crowdfunded album in Greece!

<p><b>Help us to perform STEIN,
a show based on the work of this famous writer.</b></p>
<p>You know Gertrude Stein, the great American writer, don’t
you? Not only did she write “Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose” but many more
beautiful, poetic lines. What about this, written 100 years ago: </p>
<p>""<i><span>Elephant beaten with candy and little pops
and chews all bolts and reckless reckless rats, this is this.""</span></i></p>
<p></p>
<p>And: </p>
<p><i>""A little monkey goes like a donkey that means to say that means to
say that more sighs last goes. Leave with it. A little monkey goes like a
donkey.""</i></p>
<p>These texts may sound a
little cryptic, and yes, they are! Those texts are meant to have no meaning.
They concentrate on the beauty of the poem itself and its construction, similar
to a cubist or an abstract painting. Stein composes with words.<br/>To us, these texts demand to be sung, to be put to
music. And that is exactly what we are going to do. 

</p><p>That is what we need your help!</p>
<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>We are the <u><a href=""http://powensemble.nl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>POW Ensemble</span></a></u>, a new music group from
The Netherlands. We have an open-minded view regarding what contemporary music
is. In our 13 years of existence we have been influenced by collaboration with
performers from very different backgrounds: jazz and rock musicians, tap
dancers, writers, DJ's, classical virtuosi, and experimental electronic
composers.</p>
<p>In our new program, <b>STEIN</b>, we pay homage to the great
writer Gertrude Stein. We play songs based on the texts from her book Tender
Buttons, delicately set to music by composer Luc Houtkamp. For a first sample
from the production, watch our video clip!</p>
<p>We are: singer/keyboard player <b>Stephanie Pan</b>, tap
dancer <b>Peter Kuit</b>, tuba player <b>Axel Schappert </b>and <b>Luc Houtkamp</b> on saxes, live
electronics and computer.</p>
<p><b>What do we want?</b></p>
<p>We want to raise 3000 euro for a special promotion
concert of STEIN for invited guests: sponsors, crowdfunders (you!),
journalists, organizers, and other invited guests. It allows us to give
that performance a festive spirit and, besides the usual crowd of people loving
our music, attracts a broader audience, and generate interest from organizers,
concert promoters and the press – resulting in <i>many more concerts</i>. A thrilling promotion concert gives the program an excellent
head start!</p>
<p>The general costs for preparations, rehearsals,
acquisition and general publicity will be obtained by grants and additional
subsidies. With your money we will be able to pay the musicians and technician
for their work, create extra publicity for the event and festive theatre props
for the concert, and provide refreshments for the guests. </p>
<p>The promotion concert will take place on September 10, 2015
in Studio LOOS in Den haag, The Netherlands. We start preparations and rehearsals in the beginning of next
year. </p>
<p><b>What we’re going to
do with the money</b></p>
<p>Here is the budget (in Euros):</p>Fees (musicians and technician) 1500<br/>Travel costs<span>  200</span><br/>Rent of venue<span>  250</span>

<p><b>What do you get from
us in return?</b></p>
<p>We are deeply grateful for your support, and have
something to offer each one of you, depending on the amount you donate, from
digital downloads, free ticket for the show, to house concerts. To make life
easy we have created several bundles to choose from, depending on the amount of
money that you would like to invest in us.</p><p>Update: for 250,- you receive a unique strip drawing by Gabriel Kousbroek, signed by the artist himself. See picture above.<br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This is one of the
hardest things I've ever written in my life. I wouldn't have thought
in a million years at the age of 24 I would be burying my only
biological brother Clarence Minter Jr. He was just weeks away from reaching
his 26th birthday. My family and I are devastated at the
tragedy. Clarence passed the 19th of December from a gunshot
wound to the neck and chest. He was one heck of a guy; funny, respectful, and a
great father to his three year old daughter who will never see
""daddy"" again because of the coward who pulled the trigger.
Therefore, I'm stepping in to ensure that my niece's <a href=""#"" id=""_GPLITA_4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: transparent !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by mm1501"">college fund<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""background-color: transparent !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: super !important; width: 10px !important;""/></a> and needs are
met with the loss of my brother. </p>
<p>Our parents only had
two boys Clarence was the drawer/mechanic and I'm an upcoming Independent
Artist that pushes daily to share my <a href=""#"" id=""_GPLITA_5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: transparent !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by mm1501"">gift<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""background-color: transparent !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: super !important; width: 10px !important;""/></a> to the world! As my life changed
indefinitely my platform through music unfolded right before my eyes. Hopefully
this will grant me a larger stage to use my voice to bring awareness to
gun violence and the need for world peace through the Stop The Violence ""<b>M.A.G.N.U.M.</b>""
 Movement!</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p>The risk of us not
reaching ""our"" goal will be a MAJOR setback BUT, it will not stop us
from moving forward with releasing the first album at some point or pushing
forward with the Stop The Violence <b>M.A.G.N.U.M.</b> Movement. </p>

The Impact 

This is one of the
hardest things I've ever written in my life. I wouldn't have thought
in a million years at the age of 24 I would be burying my only
biological brother Clarence Minter Jr. He was just weeks away from reaching
his 26th birthday. My family and I are devastated at the
tragedy. Clarence passed the 19th of December from a gunshot
wound to the neck and chest. He was one heck of a guy; funny, respectful, and a
great father to his three year old daughter who will never see
""daddy"" again because of the coward who pulled the trigger.
Therefore, I'm stepping in to ensure that my niece's college fund and needs are
met with the loss of my brother. 
Our parents only had
two boys Clarence was the drawer/mechanic and I'm an upcoming Independent
Artist that pushes daily to share my gift to the world! As my life changed
indefinitely my platform through music unfolded right before my eyes. Hopefully
this will grant me a larger stage to use my voice to bring awareness to
gun violence and the need for world peace through the Stop The Violence ""M.A.G.N.U.M.""
 Movement!


Risks & Challenges 
The risk of us not
reaching ""our"" goal will be a MAJOR setback BUT, it will not stop us
from moving forward with releasing the first album at some point or pushing
forward with the Stop The Violence M.A.G.N.U.M. Movement.

À Propos
Bonjour, je m'appelle Ariane Morin, je suis une saxophoniste spécialisée en musique du monde établie à Montréal, Québec.

Je suis passionnée par la musique Turque et des Balkans depuis plusieurs années. J'ai joué et étudier ce style auprès de grand musicien tel que Christian Dawid, le clarinettiste et saxophoniste de Konsonans Retro et membre de The Others Europeans. 

Durant la dernière année, j'ai travaillé avec mon groupe Massapan, un trio Balkan Jazz en interprétant des chansons de ces régions. Notre premier album a été lancée en Juin dernier au Ghetto Shul lors du Festival de Jazz de Montréal. Je joue également dans un duo de musique traditionnelle des Balkans. Et maintenant je souhaite aller dans cette région afin de perfectionner dans ce style.

 
J'ai été en contact avec Richard Laniepce, un musicien que j'admire qui a innové la musique Turque sur mon instrument, le saxophone, avec le groupe bien connu Kolektif Istanbul. Et en plus, il est français! Il a accepté de m'apprendre si je réussi à aller à Istanbul!
 
 
Istanbul est une ville historique, moderne et multiculturelle située entre l'Europe et le Moyen-Orient. Durant la période de l'empire Ottoman, la musique orientale a été une forte influence pour la musique des Balkans. Par exemple: les rythmes irréguliers tels que 7/8, 9/8, 11/8.ect ainsi que différentes gammes arabes comme Hicaz. C'est pourquoi il est naturel pour moi d'aller à la source dans cette ville remplie d'incroyables musiciens maître en musique traditionnelle!

 
Et c'est là que je me retourne vers vous! La communauté pour me supporter! Je prévois aller deux mois à Istanbul pour bien m'impregner de la culture. J'ai travailler fort pour mettre de l'argent de côté afin de suivre ma passion et d'apprendre au pied de grands musiciens et développer mon style authentique. Mais l'argent pour le voyage, logement ainsi que des cours avec différents professeurs là bas reste encore à trouver!

 
J'ai beaucoup de grand projets pour mon retour, entre autre développer un nouveau répertoire avec Massapan, enregistrer un album complet dans le future, différentes collaborations avec les talentueux musiciens d'ici et ma gratitude éternelle pour amis, famille et étrangers qui supporter pour réaliser mes rêves!

C'est un objectif flexible, indigogo me permet de collecter les contributions petites ou grandè à la fin du délai et aideront à rendre mon séjour musical que plus profitable. L'argent sera utilisé surtout pour payer les différents cours privés ainsi que les déplacement pour s'y rendre ainsi que d'autres activités connexe à mon apprentissage et mon perfectionnement à Istanbul.

Aussi, pour démontrer ma gratitude, il y a différents prix bonus dépendament du montant que vous aller donner.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi, thanks for stopping by. I hope you will stay long enough to watch the video and see me beg. My name is Blaine Long. I am a singer/songwriter in Chandler, Arizona and make my living playing original music.  I have been writing songs and playing for live audiences since 1996. My live shows have been described as ""raw"" and ""confessional"" and my style as ""storytelling improv that relys on the dynamics of my voice and guitar"".  I don't know about all that. I just try to be honest. If you wanna have a listen, go <a href=""http://www.blainelong.com/music.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">here</a>. </p>
<h3>My Project</h3>

Hi, thanks for stopping by. I hope you will stay long enough to watch the video and see me beg. My name is Blaine Long. I am a singer/songwriter in Chandler, Arizona and make my living playing original music.  I have been writing songs and playing for live audiences since 1996. My live shows have been described as ""raw"" and ""confessional"" and my style as ""storytelling improv that relys on the dynamics of my voice and guitar"".  I don't know about all that. I just try to be honest. If you wanna have a listen, go here.

<p>Hi. I’m Heather Ault, artist and founder of 4000 Years for Choice. For the past several years, I’ve been creating visual culture about the history of abortion and contraception with the goal of decreasing abortion stigma, increasing conversation about reproductive freedom, and creating healing opportunities for women who’ve had abortions.</p>
<h2>Celebration and Events</h2>
<p>Last year, I went to Washington D.C. for the 39<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Roe v Wade with a dozen beautiful banners carrying powerful messages about women's goodness, such as ""<em>Good women have abortions!</em>"" This year, I will be returning to the Supreme Court for the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary with more positive slogans based on women’s personal stories, inspiring quotes, and other powerful statements from the reproductive rights community. During the next few months, I will be sharing the Roe v Wade banners and the 4000 Years for Choice project at national conferences, art exhibits, and college campuses around the country through 2013. I need your help to make this happen!</p>
<h2>Call to Action</h2>
<p>I need to raise $4000 to cover the costs of the design and production of about 20 new beautiful banners for the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary and pay for my travel expenses to Washington D.C. for the week of January 22<sup>nd</sup> as well as to events around the country where I will be presenting the 4000 Years for Choice project.</p>
<p>So I’m turning to my strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, I’m offering original framed artwork signed by the artist, inspiring note cards to give to friends, and awesome t-shirts. Your contribution will help me continue the work of sharing the history of abortion and contraception through positive messages that heal and inspire, and further, create visual culture that beautifully celebrates Roe v Wade this year.</p>
<h2>#1 Fund the Banners</h2>
<p>I'm producing 20 (or more!) beautiful banners using slogans selected by the abortion rights and reproductive justice community! These vinyl banners will be 3 x 4 feet in size with adjustable handles in a hand-carrying bags. Your contribution will help with designing, printing, shipping, and my travel costs to and from Washington D.C.</p>

<h2>Comments from Fans</h2>
<p>""Heather Ault's work is not only breathtakingly beautiful, but also refreshing and inspiring.

<p>""4000 Years for Choice makes my heart sing. I am so grateful. It is an opportunity to look at the big picture, the historical picture, even the spiritual picture ~ all of which unambiguously show that women's choice is inalienable and life-serving. I believe the perspective you offer here can help women and men stand up for our women's rights in a healing way.

<p>There are many challenges facing independent artists, today. Competing with the manpower and marketing dollars of a major music label is probably the greatest of these challenges. And, because of that imbalance, it's often difficult to breakout from the digital realm, to become a ""known"" name, to get placement on radio playlists or reviews in various trade periodicals. Even the simple act of hiring a booking agent to secure A-List gigs or festival dates can seem an all too distant dream.</p>
<p>Yet, being an independent artist can be the most rewarding experience any songwriter could ever hope for because we have a real opportunity to get to know the audience beyond just a fan-base; we get to build lasting friendships while sharing our music in the most intimate way, performing in small venues and in-home concerts.</p>
<p><strong>Hello, my name is Peter. Please Accept My Personal Invitation to Join me in a New Musical Adventure.</strong> Over the next 60 days, I truly hope you will find my brand of Americana to be a welcome friend, a music that resonates within you and with your life's experience.</p>
<h2><strong>The Project is Named: <em>‘a complicated MAN’</em><br/></strong></h2>
<p>The project is based upon Mountain Influenced Acoustic Guitar with Celtic, Blues or Alternative Country injected to complete the musical journey. The lyrics are story driven, the direct product of my collaboration with Starburst Music. We've already tackled the time and expense of recording 11 songs including the title track: <strong><em>‘Complicated Man’</em></strong>.</p>
<p>CD Baby has been designated as primary distributor, both domestically and abroad, which includes Amazon.com, iTunes, and Spotify among many other online retailers and digital stores. We have 100 High Def CDs printed by Disc Makers for promotional purposes. Dedicated websites are up and running, ready for exploration as well as individual song, album, MP3 or CD purchases.</p>
<p>It’s a decent start for an independent artist because we now have the most basic of tools, and most importantly, the confidence to offer this exclusive invitation.</p>
<h2><strong><em>We Want You To Join Us!</em></strong></h2>
<p>More directly, I want you to be an important part in this independent artist's story. I want this to become your success story, as well as mine. So, here’s what’s up.</p>
<p>We need to market ‘a complicated MAN’ just like the major labels do. But, we don’t need major label expense accounts. We just need to be smart. That’s why we did our homework and selected one of the top PR organizations in the music industry to partner with this project. At $5,000 (five-thousand dollars – which is our first crowd-sourcing goal), their fee is extremely reasonable for the job they promise and will accomplish.</p>
<p><strong><em>Here’s a snapshot of what they offer: International Firm with Support Staff of 7 assisting in the Performance of a 90-Day Intensive PR/Release Support Campaign, inclusive of the following.</em></strong></p>
<h2><strong><em>Radio Airplay Promo</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target 7500 National &amp; International radio stations that air our genre of music. They will be a combination of: mainstream, Internet, college, satellite, independent, pod cast &amp; community radio.</strong></li>
</ul><h2><em><strong>Film/TV Song Placement Promo </strong></em></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Introduce our music to 1100 film &amp; TV supervisors, production studios, ad agencies &amp; filmmakers.</strong></li>
</ul><h2><strong><em>National &amp; International Press promo </em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target 5,000 Music industry contacts to garner CD music reviews &amp; write ups from both published &amp; unpublished prominent industry professionals. </strong></li>
</ul><h2><strong><em>Booking Agent &amp; Festival Organizer promo</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target 150 US &amp; Canadian music festival directors &amp; 100 International booking agents seeking new talent for their venues, festivals and events.</strong></li>
</ul><h2><strong><em>Local Buzz Media promo  </em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Target approximately 100 local &amp; regional radio stations, television programs, journalists &amp; magazines to introduce the CD release.</strong></li>
</ul><h2>
<strong><em>6</em></strong><em> <strong>Social Media promos</strong></em>
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Draw attention to the artist website, videos, CD and upcoming performance schedule, by targeting 25,000 International entertainment industry personnel through the PR firm’s Twitter, Facebook &amp; LinkedIn accounts.   </strong></li>
</ul><h2><strong><em>Proposed Reach:</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Countries covered under the PR Campaign:  USA, Canada, England, Scotland, The Netherlands, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Spain, Greece, France, Italy, Denmark, Austria, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Poland, Ukraine, Switzerland, New Zealand, Israel, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Russia, Japan, China, India, South Africa, Portugal, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Bahamas, Jamaica.</strong></li>
</ul><p><em> </em></p>
<h2><em>So, That is Goal Number One </em></h2>
<h2><em>Launch a Major Publicity Campaign</em></h2>
<h2><em>Build Meaningful Exposure &amp; Momentum</em></h2>
<h2><em>Now, On to Goal Number Two - It's SHOWTIME</em></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Next, we have a <strong><em>CD Release Event</em></strong> <strong><em>&amp; Live Concert</em></strong> scheduled for <em><strong>Saturday, June 22nd, at Latitude 35</strong></em>, located in the heart of Knoxville, TN (concert room w/stage, sound system and 250 patron capacity). Oh, and by the way, <strong>You Are INVITED!</strong></p>
<p>Proposed support activity for the event includes a TV interview with the Knoxville CBS Affiliate Station which serves numerous tourist destinations, trafficked artisan enclaves and major university campuses located throughout the Great Smoky and Blue Ridge Mountain regions. </p>
<p>Should we gain enough backer support and surpass our initial goal, we can then tackle the necessary travel expenses associated with performances and marketing activities, the replication of additional CDs and MP3 download cards to be offered for sale at concerts, festivals, cultural events, at retail, or thru our website store and that is our $10,000 (ten-thousand dollar) goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><em>Our Stretch Goal: The Follow-Up Album</em></h2>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Now, if we do our job exceptionally well; and, together we advance this campaign to the $50,000 level or more, we will proceed with producing a follow-up CD/Digital Download Collection, featuring studio time with a string quartet, a keyboardist extraordinaire and a world music percussionist. This project will be recorded in the Fall of 2013 for wide release during the 2013 Christmas Holiday Selling Season.</p>
<p><strong><em>RISK &amp; REWARD:</em></strong> With any entertainment project there is always a certain level of risk but we have jumped the hurdle of 'will a CD/Digital Release be completed'? Complicated Man is already in the can and ready for wide distribution.</p>
<p>As you read thru the various funding levels, we hope you will agree that we have worked diligently to match each level with rewards that are either already available or deliverable with that level of involvement.</p>

<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2013 REVIEW</span></strong><strong>: </strong><strong><em>‘a complicated MAN’</em></strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>""This is a recording from one of our great storytellers sharing complex life experiences in song-form. Peter’s voice  is distinctive, inimitable, forceful, subtle and true to life.  But more importantly, his inner voice is powerful and obvious in this collection, and that's what makes it so truly special.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Upon listening, one might find the vocal phrasing similar to Willie Nelson or Bob Dylan, with a slight Celtic feel and supported by equally unique acoustic guitar work. Thought provoking lyrics are the norm throughout this album, like ""our baby girl, she only wants to die” from the song ‘<em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Mistress of the Vein</span></em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">’</span>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And, my favorite is the title track, ‘<em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Complicated Man</span></em>’, the perfect name for this project - because Peter Olach bares his soul and throughout shows just how complex he is, as great songwriters do. My Recommendation: You have to add this  CD to your music collection!""</strong></p>

<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">2013 REVIEW</span></strong><strong>: </strong><strong><em>‘a complicated MAN’</em></strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>""Beginning with the early 70's, award-winning songwriter/artist Peter Olach (PGO) toured extensively throughout the USA &amp; Canada. Now, residing in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Peter's newest release 'Complicated MAN' demonstrates, with exquisite clarity, the full breadth and maturity of a master singer/songwriter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CDs title song dives head first into the complexity and dichotomies of living within the human condition. The impactive ‘<em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Far from Home</span></em>’ has brought many a listener to tears as it paints a picture of societal alienation. And, then there is the incredibly upbeat ‘<em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Wedding Dress</span></em>’ which teases us with its surprise ending.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Peter's expert blending of the very best elements of Alternative Folk, Celtic, Country and Americana forge a whole new genre of quiet elegance. These latest original songs represent the result of collaboration with Starburst Music and are sure to provoke thoughtful reflection in even the most astute listener.""</strong></p>

<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p></div>","INDEPENDENT MUSIC Knocking at Your Door
There are many challenges facing independent artists, today. Competing with the manpower and marketing dollars of a major music label is probably the greatest of these challenges. And, because of that imbalance, it's often difficult to breakout from the digital realm, to become a ""known"" name, to get placement on radio playlists or reviews in various trade periodicals. Even the simple act of hiring a booking agent to secure A-List gigs or festival dates can seem an all too distant dream.
Yet, being an independent artist can be the most rewarding experience any songwriter could ever hope for because we have a real opportunity to get to know the audience beyond just a fan-base; we get to build lasting friendships while sharing our music in the most intimate way, performing in small venues and in-home concerts.
Hello, my name is Peter. Please Accept My Personal Invitation to Join me in a New Musical Adventure. Over the next 60 days, I truly hope you will find my brand of Americana to be a welcome friend, a music that resonates within you and with your life's experience.
The Project is Named: ‘a complicated MAN’
The project is based upon Mountain Influenced Acoustic Guitar with Celtic, Blues or Alternative Country injected to complete the musical journey. The lyrics are story driven, the direct product of my collaboration with Starburst Music. We've already tackled the time and expense of recording 11 songs including the title track: ‘Complicated Man’.
CD Baby has been designated as primary distributor, both domestically and abroad, which includes Amazon.com, iTunes, and Spotify among many other online retailers and digital stores. We have 100 High Def CDs printed by Disc Makers for promotional purposes. Dedicated websites are up and running, ready for exploration as well as individual song, album, MP3 or CD purchases.
It’s a decent start for an independent artist because we now have the most basic of tools, and most importantly, the confidence to offer this exclusive invitation.
We Want You To Join Us!
More directly, I want you to be an important part in this independent artist's story. I want this to become your success story, as well as mine. So, here’s what’s up.
We need to market ‘a complicated MAN’ just like the major labels do. But, we don’t need major label expense accounts. We just need to be smart. That’s why we did our homework and selected one of the top PR organizations in the music industry to partner with this project. At $5,000 (five-thousand dollars – which is our first crowd-sourcing goal), their fee is extremely reasonable for the job they promise and will accomplish.
Here’s a snapshot of what they offer: International Firm with Support Staff of 7 assisting in the Performance of a 90-Day Intensive PR/Release Support Campaign, inclusive of the following.
Radio Airplay Promo

Target 7500 National & International radio stations that air our genre of music. They will be a combination of: mainstream, Internet, college, satellite, independent, pod cast & community radio.
Film/TV Song Placement Promo 

Introduce our music to 1100 film & TV supervisors, production studios, ad agencies & filmmakers.
National & International Press promo 

Target 5,000 Music industry contacts to garner CD music reviews & write ups from both published & unpublished prominent industry professionals. 
Booking Agent & Festival Organizer promo

Target 150 US & Canadian music festival directors & 100 International booking agents seeking new talent for their venues, festivals and events.
Local Buzz Media promo  

Target approximately 100 local & regional radio stations, television programs, journalists & magazines to introduce the CD release.

6 Social Media promos


Draw attention to the artist website, videos, CD and upcoming performance schedule, by targeting 25,000 International entertainment industry personnel through the PR firm’s Twitter, Facebook & LinkedIn accounts.   
Proposed Reach:

Countries covered under the PR Campaign:  USA, Canada, England, Scotland, The Netherlands, Ireland, Australia, Germany, Spain, Greece, France, Italy, Denmark, Austria, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Poland, Ukraine, Switzerland, New Zealand, Israel, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Russia, Japan, China, India, South Africa, Portugal, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela, Bahamas, Jamaica.
 
So, That is Goal Number One 
Launch a Major Publicity Campaign
Build Meaningful Exposure & Momentum
Now, On to Goal Number Two - It's SHOWTIME
 
Next, we have a CD Release Event & Live Concert scheduled for Saturday, June 22nd, at Latitude 35, located in the heart of Knoxville, TN (concert room w/stage, sound system and 250 patron capacity). Oh, and by the way, You Are INVITED!
Proposed support activity for the event includes a TV interview with the Knoxville CBS Affiliate Station which serves numerous tourist destinations, trafficked artisan enclaves and major university campuses located throughout the Great Smoky and Blue Ridge Mountain regions. 
Should we gain enough backer support and surpass our initial goal, we can then tackle the necessary travel expenses associated with performances and marketing activities, the replication of additional CDs and MP3 download cards to be offered for sale at concerts, festivals, cultural events, at retail, or thru our website store and that is our $10,000 (ten-thousand dollar) goal.
 
Our Stretch Goal: The Follow-Up Album
 
Now, if we do our job exceptionally well; and, together we advance this campaign to the $50,000 level or more, we will proceed with producing a follow-up CD/Digital Download Collection, featuring studio time with a string quartet, a keyboardist extraordinaire and a world music percussionist. This project will be recorded in the Fall of 2013 for wide release during the 2013 Christmas Holiday Selling Season.
RISK & REWARD: With any entertainment project there is always a certain level of risk but we have jumped the hurdle of 'will a CD/Digital Release be completed'? Complicated Man is already in the can and ready for wide distribution.
As you read thru the various funding levels, we hope you will agree that we have worked diligently to match each level with rewards that are either already available or deliverable with that level of involvement.
 
We Want This Introduction To Become 
A Lifelong Friendship Between Us
And, Thank You For Any Level 
Of Consideration You Pledge
 
As Always,
Your Friend in Music 
Peter Olach - PGO
 
NOTICE: Backers outside of North America, Please ADD $15.00 to Your Pledge to Cover Currency Exchange Rates and Any Additional Shipping Charges. THANK YOU!
 

2013 REVIEW: ‘a complicated MAN’

""This is a recording from one of our great storytellers sharing complex life experiences in song-form. Peter’s voice  is distinctive, inimitable, forceful, subtle and true to life.  But more importantly, his inner voice is powerful and obvious in this collection, and that's what makes it so truly special.
Upon listening, one might find the vocal phrasing similar to Willie Nelson or Bob Dylan, with a slight Celtic feel and supported by equally unique acoustic guitar work. Thought provoking lyrics are the norm throughout this album, like ""our baby girl, she only wants to die” from the song ‘Mistress of the Vein’.
And, my favorite is the title track, ‘Complicated Man’, the perfect name for this project - because Peter Olach bares his soul and throughout shows just how complex he is, as great songwriters do. My Recommendation: You have to add this  CD to your music collection!""
– Roy Elkins, CEO/Founder, www.Broadjam.com
 

2013 REVIEW: ‘a complicated MAN’

""Beginning with the early 70's, award-winning songwriter/artist Peter Olach (PGO) toured extensively throughout the USA & Canada. Now, residing in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Peter's newest release 'Complicated MAN' demonstrates, with exquisite clarity, the full breadth and maturity of a master singer/songwriter.
The CDs title song dives head first into the complexity and dichotomies of living within the human condition. The impactive ‘Far from Home’ has brought many a listener to tears as it paints a picture of societal alienation. And, then there is the incredibly upbeat ‘Wedding Dress’ which teases us with its surprise ending.
Peter's expert blending of the very best elements of Alternative Folk, Celtic, Country and Americana forge a whole new genre of quiet elegance. These latest original songs represent the result of collaboration with Starburst Music and are sure to provoke thoughtful reflection in even the most astute listener.""
– Gary Vandy, Producer, Studio Center, Miami

<h3>Update!</h3>
<p>Every dollar we go over our goal will go directly to the incredible cast of this production. Show your support for young opera singers by donating!</p>
<p>And now you can get a gorgeous Helios tote bag when you donate just $25!</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We founded Helios Early Opera last year because we believe there can't be enough good opera in the world, especially Baroque opera. Opera can seem stuffy, it can seem elitist, it can seem to require lots of knowledge and familiarity to fully appreciate. We disagree. Helios' goal is to do away with all that pretension. Early period opera is the least pretentious of all, we believe. We want first-time opera-goers to be thrilled and moved and entertained because we believe opera is relevant and valuable. We're doing this because we love opera. Help give us a chance to persuade you to love it too! In the words of Franco Zeffirelli: “I have always believed that opera is a planet where the muses work together, join hands and celebrate all the arts.”</p>
<p>We've chosen Cavalli's <em>Artemisia</em> for our winter show because it's both beautiful and fun. The music is delightful and full of energy; the plot engaging and humorous. Director Aria Umezawa is setting the show in modern Hollywood where internationally renowned actress Artemisia navigates fame and scandal as she struggles to find love after the death of her husband. We have a supremely talented cast of singers and an orchestra of remarkable early music specialists. It's going to be an enthralling show and we hope you'll help make it possible!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As Molière put it, ""Of all the noises known to man, opera is the most expensive."" Opera requires all the costs of an orchestral concert plus all the expenses of a theatrical spectacle. Helios spends the majority of our budget on our artists (all our administrative work is unpaid) which means your donation goes straight to young musicians. We make only 20% of our yearly budget from ticket sales (a large percentage for an opera company) which means we have to make up the rest with grants and donations. We choose to keep our ticket prices low because we want our performances to be affordable to most people.</p>
<p>We're trying to achieve $5,700 from this campaign. If we reach this goal, an anonymous donor will match your contributions doubling this total. This amount plus the funds we've already raised this year and projected ticket sales will cover the total cost of putting on <em>Artemisia</em> (about $20K). If we don't make our goal, we'll be forced to make budget cuts leading to: a smaller orchestra, a minimal set, minimal costumes and props. We will have to forgo recording the production and we may be forced to increase ticket prices. Please help us avoid this!</p>
<p>We have some great perks to thank you for your donation. Each person who donates will be named in the <em>Artemisia</em> program! We have unreleased video clips from last year's thrilling production of Charpentier's <em>David et Jonathas</em> and sneak preview photographs from the recent <em>Artemisia</em> photoshoot. We have a handsome tote bag with the Helios logo; a full DVD of <em>David et Jonathas</em> (unavailable for purchase); VIP tickets to the show. We have an exclusive soiree with the <em>Artemisia</em> cast and directors in January where you can meet the artists while enjoying wine and hors d'oevres! We are even offering a private house concert showcasing our talented cast and orchestra members.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support not only helps Helios put on this show, it reaffirms that opera is a vital and important art form that still has relevance in the 21st-century. We are committed to demonstrating that this is so. Our first two productions garnered much critical acclaim:</p>
<p>Pulitzer prize-winning critic Lloyd Schwartz said of <em>David et Jonathas</em>, ""I thoroughly enjoyed [Helios'] first major production, and I hope people will be on the lookout for their next.""</p>
<p>Of our recent performance of Telemann's <em>Pimpinone</em>, which took place in a nightclub, the Boston Musical Intelligencer enthused, ""Being up close and personal with the music, with plenty of laughs and maybe a drink in hand made for some smart entertainment.""</p>
We are also committed to expanding the audience for opera. Last year, we donated tickets to a group of home-schoolers who traveled all the way from Eastern New York to see their first opera. As one teenager put it: ""Seeing this opera made me think of art as a whole.""</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
There are many ways to help us besides donating money:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Host an out-of-town artist! Many of our singers and instrumentalists travel from far away to be part of our production. Meet a new friend and support opera at the same time!</li>
<li>Spread the word. We're a new group and we're trying to introduce opera to more people. Tell a friend about our show. Share this campaign on your blog or Facebook.</li>
<li>Volunteer. Opera requires a lot of time and a lot of people. Tell us about your skills and interests, we always need more help!</li>

<h3>the ASCAP ""I Create Music"" Expo - ooh - ooh - ooh</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Carissa, a 30 year-old aspiring singer-songwriter and artist living in Seattle.  I've had dreams of being a rock star since I was a kid goofing around with my mom's acoustic guitar; dressed up in black shades, a button up shirt, tie, and slicked back hair.   That dream had been just that until recently.   I had been teaching myself guitar off and on and writing songs since I was in my early twenties, but I didn't get serious about it until a year and a half ago when I finally got the courage up to take guitar lessons and play at open mics.  </p>

<p>Sharing music with children is one of the best parts of my job as a preschool teacher, and now I’m very excited to record my first album of children’s music!</p>
<p>My album will be full of my handpicked favorite cover songs to share with kids; they’re story-driven, fun and whimsical, participatory, and educational.  It will also include one original song of mine about Kindness that the children at my school really seem to connect to. My goal is that this album will encourage people of every age to sing along and play.</p>
<p>It’s partially a fundraiser!</p>
<p>I’m going to call the album Songs from Skyline and I will be donating all of the sales of the CD at Skyline Preschool’s Spring fundraiser, the Spring Fling, to the school playground and scholarship fund. This fund helps keep our playground safe and looking good and is also a scholarship fund for Skyline Families that need some financial support. I plan to sell the CD at the Spring Fling for years to come, and if it does well, this could lead to more recordings! </p>
<p>I’m very excited to work with a couple of friends on the album-yay for friends! Linda Hamilton, Mom to former Skyline Preschoolers Ben and Max will be playing guitar and singing as well as contributing her own song ""pick"",  and Kele Nitolo will be playing drums and lots of fun percussion.</p>
<p>I have a budget of $5000. Most of the money will go to studio time and musicians. Other costs include reproduction, mixing, mastering, graphic design, and distribution.  I met with my producer at his studio in Emeryville last week-he’s great and already has wonderful ideas for the album. If I raise more money than my goal, it will most likely be spent on more studio time!</p>
<p>I get so much joy from diving into creative projects and expressing myself artistically.It is my sincere intention to inspire the children I work with to take on their own creative dreams and enjoy whatever form of artistic expression that calls to them. It is my hope that this album will be inspiring to the children I work with, and to all the children that enjoy it.</p>
<p>Please consider donating what you can, this project will not be possible without your help! </p>
<p>I hope you can benefit from my perks-check them out!</p>
<p>Another HUGE help I would appreciate is to pass this on to friends and family you think might be connected to the project or interested in a CD, thanks for spreading the word!</p>

I’m very excited to work with a couple of friends on the album-yay for friends! Linda Hamilton, Mom to former Skyline Preschoolers Ben and Max will be playing guitar and singing as well as contributing her own song ""pick"",  and Kele Nitolo will be playing drums and lots of fun percussion.
I have a budget of $5000. Most of the money will go to studio time and musicians. Other costs include reproduction, mixing, mastering, graphic design, and distribution.  I met with my producer at his studio in Emeryville last week-he’s great and already has wonderful ideas for the album. If I raise more money than my goal, it will most likely be spent on more studio time!
I get so much joy from diving into creative projects and expressing myself artistically.It is my sincere intention to inspire the children I work with to take on their own creative dreams and enjoy whatever form of artistic expression that calls to them. It is my hope that this album will be inspiring to the children I work with, and to all the children that enjoy it.
Please consider donating what you can, this project will not be possible without your help! 
I hope you can benefit from my perks-check them out!
Another HUGE help I would appreciate is to pass this on to friends and family you think might be connected to the project or interested in a CD, thanks for spreading the word!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Here's your chance to help make ""History"" (I love the word play in that, just for the record :)</h3>
<p>My name is Matt, and my music act is called The Real Matt Jones. Over the course of the past 7 years, my bandmates and I have been incredibly blessed to have landed a management deal, a publishing deal, song placements in numerous movies, and the opportunity to play alongside some of our favorite major label acts all over the country (and even some in Canada!)</p>
<p>We're through with the writing and the recording of our 3rd full-length record, called <em>History</em>. This record has been almost 4 years in the making, so we're confident that it's finally good!</p>
<p>We're doing this Indiegogo campaign for that last ""push over the cliff"" (in the words of Nigel Tufnel), so that the art, mastering, and production will match the effort of the writing and the recording we've put into this record over the last 4 years.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All things considered, we are trying to raise a very small amount of money in relation to the project we've taken on. We've already had songs from <em>History</em> that major label artists have expressed interest in recording (or a ""hold"" on tunes for you Nashville Cats), and we couldn't be more happy with the recording and writing that you'll hear on this record.</p>
<p>So - here's your chance to be part of making this record finally happen! We've got all kinds of ""perks"" as Indiegogo calls them for contributing at each level...you can even have your name featured in the credits of this CD, or even have a house concert in your own living room anywhere in the world. We tried to make a donation level available for everybody, so make sure you check out all the perks to the right on your screen! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will be the 3rd full-length studio record for The Real Matt Jones, but it will be the 9th studio recording effort from the writers and band members involved. We believe that this is the best possible way to have fans and artists help each other - absolutely directly. When you contribute to a campaign like this, you are not paying a label to tell us what to do. You are not giving money to a nameless, faceless corporation that is only concerned with the bottom line - you are giving direct support to artists that are using those resources to be as ardently creative as possible, and we love you for it.</p>
<p>So, all in all, this is the way that you can help make this record the best possible record we can put out. We promise to keep making music, writing stories, and recording records as long as we have something to contribute.</p>
<p>Thank you incredibly for your time and donations; without you, we're permanently rehearsing ;)</p>
<p>-TRMJ</p>
<p>P.S. - All proceeds from this campaign, whether we reach the goal or not will go towards the production of <em>History. </em>If you cannot contribute, please share this campaign with your friends, or email us and let us know if you'd like to help in some other way. We love and appreciate you guys!</p>

My name is Matt, and my music act is called The Real Matt Jones. Over the course of the past 7 years, my bandmates and I have been incredibly blessed to have landed a management deal, a publishing deal, song placements in numerous movies, and the opportunity to play alongside some of our favorite major label acts all over the country (and even some in Canada!)

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We're a rather young band hailing from Greenville, SC.  We have a profound love of music and love to play shows.  We started this band off as just a small group that we didn't expect to go far, although we all wanted the group to go as far as it possibly could.  After a couple of months of being a complete band we lost our first member and was replaced without much effort due to the first member having already scouted out another guitarist.  We recorded our first 2 song demo in the summer of 2010 and continued playing as many shows as possible.  We started to record our 5 song EP in the beginning of 2011 and finished around the beginning of the 2011 summer.  But during those months we had no idea that they would be the hardest the band would ever face.  One night after many long hours in the studio, Drew returned home and continued inside without taking his guitar or Jesse's bass out of his car.  Upon awakening the next morning Drew had found that his guitar and Jesse's bass had been stolen.  This upset Jesse and Drew to the point of depression and not returning to school for a week.  After an investigation and no leads the police have given up on searching for the stolen instruments that were like children to Jesse and Drew. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact this campaign will make is not only helping Jesse and Drew purchase new instruments after going so long with equipment that is not the greatest but it will also go towards getting the band a van or bus.  So that the band will not have such a hard time touring.  This will help Jesse and Drew immensely and will help fill the void that was left when their instruments were stripped from them. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need two new guitars, a 5 string bass and an electric, with some new pick ups and straps.  You will get free tickets to our shows and better performance out of us. </p>

<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""2"">Gary Morris, world renowned singer/songwriter/actor, officially kicked off Real Music at 166 in April of 2011, with a stellar performance. Following that first show, a gentleman who was in the audience that night pulled me aside and told me he had seen Gary perform many times over the years, in many different venues, and this performance, in this venue, was ""by far the best Gary Morris show I have ever witnessed."" He went on to tell me how incredible the sound in the room was, and how intimate of a setting our venue was. </font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""2""><br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""2"">That sentiment has been repeated over and over again with most every show we have produced in the series. The bottom line is that Real Music impacts the listener in ways most people don't expect, nor have they experienced before in a live music setting. Your generous support will help us continue to not only impact audiences in the future, but artists as well. Here are a few sentiments from just a couple of artists who have performed in our first season;</font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""2""><br/></font></p>

It's not often I play a venue I am so impressed with that I make a mental note to catch someone elses show there. This venue did just that. Theater 166 is one of those venues that will change the dynamics of live music. They are bringing back the roots of music through live performances by enabling the artist and audience to interact in a perfect flow of energy. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience, and would recommend it to anyone in the Dallas area.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Doing this type of hi definition show, requires a significant financial investment. We do everything within our power to keep our costs to a minimum. We have an all volunteer staff who give freely of their time and talents, and some of the best production people in the Dallas area are on our team. Still, the truth of the matter is, it takes a lot of money to produce this caliber of show. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have set our goal at only $10,000. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>That is the minimum amount needed(of course we would love to raise even more) to cover expenses such as venue overhead, artists honorariums, and a small amount of advertising. The more we can raise, the more advertising we can afford, and subsequently the more folks will find out about us. Since we are a small venue, seating only 150 patrons, our goal is to keep ticket prices affordable for real people. Let's face it, in our current economic climate it is difficult for most people to find discretionary funds for entertainment. Our goal is to keep our shows within the reach of real people like you. Should we fail to completely meet our $10000 goal, we may be forced to do fewer shows, or quite possibly no shows at all. Regardless, any and all monies raised here will go directly to funding the shows we book for 2012.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have set up some perks for you as well. Regardless if you are a corporation, business, group, or individual, you can give.  Depending on the amount you give, season tickets, All access passes, VIP seating, and VIP entrance to the venue are available as perks. Even limited access to the artists greenroom to meet them face to face are available. (see column on the right for more details on Perks). But don't be intimidated by the amounts, any amount you want to give will help, and small gifts can add up fast. Even if you can only do a few dollars right now, every little bit will help. Some of you may be able to give even more, so by all means feel free to do so.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Tell your friends! Even if you are unable to contribute financially at this time, you can still help. By posting our link to all of your social media sites such as Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, and others, your websites, or by sending it to your email or business contacts, you will help spread the word about this exceptional musical experience, and in so doing increase our chances to continue on in 2012. </p>

Real Heart, Real Soul, Real Music at 166. 




The Impact
Gary Morris, world renowned singer/songwriter/actor, officially kicked off Real Music at 166 in April of 2011, with a stellar performance. Following that first show, a gentleman who was in the audience that night pulled me aside and told me he had seen Gary perform many times over the years, in many different venues, and this performance, in this venue, was ""by far the best Gary Morris show I have ever witnessed."" He went on to tell me how incredible the sound in the room was, and how intimate of a setting our venue was. 

That sentiment has been repeated over and over again with most every show we have produced in the series. The bottom line is that Real Music impacts the listener in ways most people don't expect, nor have they experienced before in a live music setting. Your generous support will help us continue to not only impact audiences in the future, but artists as well. Here are a few sentiments from just a couple of artists who have performed in our first season;

""Tonyâ€™s 'Real Music @ 166' concerts have been extraordinary performance experiences for me as an artist. Theatre 166 is clearly an outstanding concert setting; built and operated by the passionate, dedicated and professional crew behind the scenes at each show. Tony has a vision and a gift for presenting a live music experience that is simply top-notch for artist and audience alike."" -Woody Russell

""I enjoyed the sound of the room more than any venue I've played in recent years, and I loved working with Tony Brown, Steve Garret and David Knight. It's not often I play a venue I am so impressed with that I make a mental note to catch someone elses show there. This venue did just that. Theater 166 is one of those venues that will change the dynamics of live music. They are bringing back the roots of music through live performances by enabling the artist and audience to interact in a perfect flow of energy. I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience, and would recommend it to anyone in the Dallas area. If you haven't seen what Theater 166 is doing yet, You need to check it out- it's one of a kind.""- Emily Grace Clark  


What We Need & What You Get
Doing this type of hi definition show, requires a significant financial investment. We do everything within our power to keep our costs to a minimum. We have an all volunteer staff who give freely of their time and talents, and some of the best production people in the Dallas area are on our team. Still, the truth of the matter is, it takes a lot of money to produce this caliber of show. 

We have set our goal at only $10,000. 

That is the minimum amount needed(of course we would love to raise even more) to cover expenses such as venue overhead, artists honorariums, and a small amount of advertising. The more we can raise, the more advertising we can afford, and subsequently the more folks will find out about us. Since we are a small venue, seating only 150 patrons, our goal is to keep ticket prices affordable for real people. Let's face it, in our current economic climate it is difficult for most people to find discretionary funds for entertainment. Our goal is to keep our shows within the reach of real people like you. Should we fail to completely meet our $10000 goal, we may be forced to do fewer shows, or quite possibly no shows at all. Regardless, any and all monies raised here will go directly to funding the shows we book for 2012.

We have set up some perks for you as well. Regardless if you are a corporation, business, group, or individual, you can give.  Depending on the amount you give, season tickets, All access passes, VIP seating, and VIP entrance to the venue are available as perks. Even limited access to the artists greenroom to meet them face to face are available. (see column on the right for more details on Perks). But don't be intimidated by the amounts, any amount you want to give will help, and small gifts can add up fast. Even if you can only do a few dollars right now, every little bit will help. Some of you may be able to give even more, so by all means feel free to do so.

Other Ways You Can Help
Tell your friends! Even if you are unable to contribute financially at this time, you can still help. By posting our link to all of your social media sites such as Facebook, Myspace, Twitter, and others, your websites, or by sending it to your email or business contacts, you will help spread the word about this exceptional musical experience, and in so doing increase our chances to continue on in 2012.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Based in Jacksonville, Florida and conducted by Dr. Cara Tasher, the UNF Chamber Singers' recent milestones include a concert tour to Italy (May 2010),  our ""when i sing"" CD  (May 2011), performance of the National Anthem live on CNN for the 2012 Florida Presidential Debate (January 2012), and then live on NPR First Coast Connect.</p>
<p>From 29 April-10 May 2012, we will be on tour in South Africa. The ensemble will sing with students from Jacksonville's sister city Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University which happens to have a stellar choral program led by Junita L. van Dijk. We will also perform alongside the University of Cape Town Choir, <span>South Cape Children's Choir at St. George's Cathedral, The </span><span lang=""EN-US"">Frank Peterson School of Music Choir in Paarl and the </span><span>Pro Cantu Youth Choir in Cape Town.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>This tour offers us a chance to cross cultural borders. For many of us, this is the first opportunity to travel internationally. We will perform concerts of diverse repertoire, including a commissioned work for SATB chorus and cello by renowned American composer Daniel Bernard Roumain commissioned by Dr. Nick Curry.</p>
<p>In addition to acting as singing ambassadors for both UNF and the USA, we hope to demonstrate a successful model of diversity in a country where the vestiges of apartheid are still prominent. Through our music-making, we hope to show that cultural boundaries can be overcome, while expanding our own perceptions of the world.</p>
<h2><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">What WE Need &amp; What YOU Get</span></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>The overall tour budget is $100,000 including airfare, lodging, food, performance venues, and on-land educational experiences. We are currently raising money through donations, selling our new CD, and booking concerts. Please help us make this trip a reality! This transformational learning experience will enrich our lives, edify us culturally while contributing to global peace and understanding.</p>

Shortly after, the side project became the main project and <b>LUX</b> was born in the Summer of 2014. Since 2014, we have: </p><p></p><ul>

Ivy sings and plays a full acoustic drum set, electric drum pad, while Jake sings and plays keyboards and a keytar. We aim to write honest lyrics that are always close to our heart and tell our real stories. In addition to writing our own lyrics, we also produce original synth tracks. <br/><p></p></div><p><i><b>WHERE WE ARE NOW</b></i><br/></p><div>
<p>In August of 2015, Jake moved to Nashville to attend Belmont University for Songwriting and Music Business and just recently started writing for Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

<p>Yes, you heard it right. We wrote an entire album over Skype and we LOVE how it turned out! </p>
<p><i><b>WHY WE DO THIS</b></i></p>
<p>We are very dedicated to making music. We are especially passionate about making music that<i> <b>resonates with people and real life</b></i>. We write music to inspire people! Sometimes writing real, heartfelt lyrics means bringing back memories of unhappy times--but we are always writing for the purpose of bringing ourselves and the world to a better place. </p>
<p>Our album is called <b>PAX</b> for a reason--by definition it means, <i>the kiss of peace</i>. We wrote this album looking back at our youth, our mistakes, and what we've learned from them. It is retrospective of our past and also introspective of where we are now--a place of peace. </p>

</div></div>","OUR STORYLUX began at the end of 2012, just a few months after Jake was on Season 7 of the TV show America's Got Talent. After the show, we began playing with another band and also started a side project as a duo. Shortly after, the side project became the main project and LUX was born in the Summer of 2014. Since 2014, we have: 
Recorded and released a self-titled EP
Released two music videos 
Opened for a variety of artists such as Andy Grammar, Ingrid Michelson, Phillip Phillips and DEV
We like to describe our music as synth pop with indie rock flavors. Ivy sings and plays a full acoustic drum set, electric drum pad, while Jake sings and plays keyboards and a keytar. We aim to write honest lyrics that are always close to our heart and tell our real stories. In addition to writing our own lyrics, we also produce original synth tracks. WHERE WE ARE NOW
In August of 2015, Jake moved to Nashville to attend Belmont University for Songwriting and Music Business and just recently started writing for Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Ivy is currently in Springfield, MO playing drums for an awesome '90s cover band and working her ""big kid job"" at the bank. Despite being 400 miles apart, we decided that LUX could not be stopped by distance. Like any band with a dream and an internet connection, we downloaded Skype and began the process of writing our full-length album, PAX! 
Yes, you heard it right. We wrote an entire album over Skype and we LOVE how it turned out! 
WHY WE DO THIS

Sometimes writing real, heartfelt lyrics means bringing back memories of unhappy times--but we are always writing for the purpose of bringing ourselves and the world to a better place. 
Our album is called PAX for a reason--by definition it means, the kiss of peace. We wrote this album looking back at our youth, our mistakes, and what we've learned from them. It is retrospective of our past and also introspective of where we are now--a place of peace.

since I didn’t seem to get the concept across in my first run, so here goes….<br/>
</div><p>What is my goal in creating this next album?  I am not attempting to launch myself out into
the world as the Next Big Artist.  I am
not marketing myself as a Singer, since my 
French accent is not an asset as an American performer.  I don’t have a band and I am not gigging.</p>
<p>My talent and my passion is writing songs, playing guitar,
arranging and producing.  I have been
blessed to be recognized by a couple of music companies who want to represent
my songs for licensing, and compilation distribution.  I am also shopping songs to Big Name Artists
to record.  I want this next album to
showcase my songwriting talents, by using vocalists who have Star Quality
voices, and expanding my production capabilities by utilizing a professional
studio to add the richness of multiple layers of tracks beyond the limitations
of my home studio.  </p>
<p>The reason I can produce songs at about $1,000 per song is
that I can save money by producing many of the tracks in my home-studio before
sending them out to a professional studio that can then take the songs to the
next level.  Because of my friendships in
the business, I can get a discounted rate on pro studio time.  I will work out deals with singers and other
musicians—I’d like to add real drums to these tracks instead of using my drum
program.</p>
<p>I will highlight both male and female singers on this album.  I may sing some harmonies myself here and
there, but my goal is not to highlight my voice, but to produce a Compilation
CD that is absolutely of Star Quality in every aspect: the story-telling of the
song, the structure and arrangements, the instrumentation, and amazing vocals
with top quality production value.  This
gives me high quality product to put in the pipeline, and will open up the
playing field for me exponentially!  (I may
even inadvertently help a budding star singer get the exposure they need to get noticed.)</p>
<p>I realize that many of us, myself included, are feeling the
pinch of our shrinking economy, and it isn’t easy to squeeze out a donation,
even for a cause we believe in.  But
without your help, I will not be able to enhance the production value beyond
what I can accomplish in my home studio. 
By pushing this project up to “the next octave” of quality, it will make
all the difference in who will take the time to listen to these songs, who will place them, and where.</p>
<p>The songs I have chosen for this next album relate to the
joys, the sorrows, and the wackiness of what it means to be a human being
trying to navigate life on this beautiful planet of ours.  These songs are about life, love and the
pursuit of happiness!  They are fun and
uplifting with sexy bluesy overtones.  I
can’t wait to share them with you.</p>
<p>While my goal is to raise $12,000, it seems unlikely at this
late juncture in the campaign that I will reach anywhere near this level. I will be able to produce one song for each
$1,200 increment received (which comes to about $1,000 after all the fees are deducted), and if the total received is less than $1,000, I will
use the funds as best I can to maximize the production value of one
song, probably by paying for singer and/or drummer’s services.</p><p>The perks are self-explanatory...and fairly ""usual"" other than a couple of chances to spend some time with me in the studio, to observe or to participate creatively on a song, or to go on a wine-tasting afternoon with me in my 'hood in the mountains.</p><p>I want to thank my early supporters for taking the plunge in
helping me take my craft up one notch which can completely change
the playing field for me.  If you are
still on the fence thinking about possibly making a donation, now is the time...with less than 2 weeks left!  </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<title></title>
<p class=""p1"">Happy Tuesday, January 18th! I'm Joy Valencia a singer and songwriter, my music is heavily inspired by my favorite artists of the 60s. You can hear my music at <a href=""http://listn.to/JoyValenciaMusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s1"">http://listn.to/JoyValenciaMusic</span></a>. <font class=""Apple-style-span""><br/><br/>I'm currently in the process of recording my very first album and have not shopped to anyone nor am I backed by any label or company atm. We are trying to shoot my very FIRST music video for my song ""Don't Wake the Lion"" this weekend and could REALLY use your help in raising some funds to make sure that all costs are covered. Boy oh boy do we need your help to make this happen!</font></p>
<p class=""p1""><font class=""Apple-style-span""><br/></font></p>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span""><b>The Impact</b><br/></font></h3>
<font class=""Apple-style-span"">First of all, the crew has donated their time and are all legit professionals in the film industry. Unfortunately, if we do not raise part of the funds by this weekend, all of our hard work, and even the opportunity to make this video will vanish.  It just so happen to be a perfect time of year when people in the film industry are not on major jobs yet, but we loose 80% of our talented crew after Monday when many of them start work on new jobs. I cannot stress to you how much your help will save our efforts and allow us to pull this video off.<br/><br/>Secondly, artists in today's music industry need a video and I feel as though It's an absolute essential piece of my puzzle. No one has seen me in this kind of format yet, they know I'm a singer/songwriter, but I have not had the opportunity to truly show myself as a performer and an artist. The concept by award winning director, Erin E. Cantelo, is so creative and really fun. Imagine me in the desert, a nomad, in search of the elusive ""Glitterfoot"" (imagine Bigfoot, but made of gold, sparkly tinsel) who may just be the key to a personal and emotional freedom that I've been searching for. It packs some interesting emotions, while still captures my very playful side - I mean dude, we have a 6'5"" Gold Bigfoot! It's gonna be a blast.<br/><br/>To tell you a little about our killer team who are all donating their time, hard work, and talents. Our incredible </font>Cinematographer, Christian Sprenger, just shot a video for the multi-Grammy nominated The Black Keys ""Howlin' For You"".

Happy Tuesday, January 18th! I'm Joy Valencia a singer and songwriter, my music is heavily inspired by my favorite artists of the 60s. You can hear my music at http://listn.to/JoyValenciaMusic. I'm currently in the process of recording my very first album and have not shopped to anyone nor am I backed by any label or company atm. We are trying to shoot my very FIRST music video for my song ""Don't Wake the Lion"" this weekend and could REALLY use your help in raising some funds to make sure that all costs are covered. Boy oh boy do we need your help to make this happen!

The Impact
First of all, the crew has donated their time and are all legit professionals in the film industry. Unfortunately, if we do not raise part of the funds by this weekend, all of our hard work, and even the opportunity to make this video will vanish.  It just so happen to be a perfect time of year when people in the film industry are not on major jobs yet, but we loose 80% of our talented crew after Monday when many of them start work on new jobs. I cannot stress to you how much your help will save our efforts and allow us to pull this video off.Secondly, artists in today's music industry need a video and I feel as though It's an absolute essential piece of my puzzle. No one has seen me in this kind of format yet, they know I'm a singer/songwriter, but I have not had the opportunity to truly show myself as a performer and an artist. The concept by award winning director, Erin E. Cantelo, is so creative and really fun. Imagine me in the desert, a nomad, in search of the elusive ""Glitterfoot"" (imagine Bigfoot, but made of gold, sparkly tinsel) who may just be the key to a personal and emotional freedom that I've been searching for. It packs some interesting emotions, while still captures my very playful side - I mean dude, we have a 6'5"" Gold Bigfoot! It's gonna be a blast.To tell you a little about our killer team who are all donating their time, hard work, and talents. Our incredible Cinematographer, Christian Sprenger, just shot a video for the multi-Grammy nominated The Black Keys ""Howlin' For You"". You can check him out here: http://sprengerdp.com. Our amazing director, Erin E. Cantelo, has really pushed the creative bounds with the concept of the video while still remaining ultra-low budget. You can check out some of her work here: http://ecantelo.com. The Production Designer, Elvis Restaino is beyond talented and has had his work featured in Architectural Digest for his design of Gerard Buttler's NY loft among other things: http://elvisr.com. Our ENTIRE crew is working for free on this video.I'll be posting behind the scenes videos in real time this weekend so you can see our progress. However, although part of the budget and the entire crew of amazing people are in place, we need your help to make the video actually happen! No donation is too small and any and ALL help is so greatly appreciated!


What We Need & What You Get
We're trying to raise money to cover food and lodging for 14 crew members for 2 nights (who by the way, will be sharing rooms, we're not being frivolous), gas and transportation to the desert, wardrobe, art department, makeup, and some equipment. The entire crew is donating their time, and the DP is donating a full Red MX camera package to the project.
