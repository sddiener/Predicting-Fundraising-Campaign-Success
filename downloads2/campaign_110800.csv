<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Noemi and I'm a poet and creative from South Texas. My borderlands tongue story begins centuries ago in Puerto Rico and Mexico  and more recently, how my parents met in Chicago. </p>
<p>My dad came to the US as a bracero and was used for his labor. My mom and her family were displaced from Puerto Rico when she was very young.  After living in Chicago we moved to South Texas where the idea of being split biculturally and triculturally was even more pronounced.</p>
<p>I came to zines when I was about 20 and wrote my first zine ""Making of a Chicana."" Influenced by young punk women of color at the time who were making zines, I wanted to document my experience as a young brown crip mother in a little place called the Rio Grande Valley as I dealt with being a single parent, poverty, working/working poor, chronically ill,  depression/anxiety and all the feelings in between. </p>
<p>This zine anthology includes the work I have done since then, beginning with ""Making of a Chicana""  in 2001, the first issue of hermana resist from 2002 as well as other one offs and mini zines I did. </p>

<h3>The Funding</h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Documenting our existence and history is vital and so many queer crip women and nonbinary zinesters and writers work is lost because it is not archived. </p>
<p>The reality is that many presses don't want to take on a zine anthology project because of the cost and size. Many also believe that since zines are a dying lo-fi product, zine anthologies won't sell and won't have traction. Another reality is that collections by women of color and nonbinary zinesters of color just do not get produced. Documenting the existence of our work from decades past is vital to portraying a part of history that we were part of, and a testament that this medium of communication was important for us latinx, grrls, punks, and others trying to find our voice, and each other. </p>
<p>The importance of zines and edu.punk in my formative years, coming into conocimiento, as we say,  means so much to me that I often cite then when giving readings and in writing. </p>
<p>Many zines of decades ago vanish without being preserved. The flats are lost or their makers are no longer with us. I strongly believe, and have advocated for ever, that it's necessary to preserve our work both because it's culturally significant and because we are often missing from zine history and history itself. Writing and producing zines is one way of documenting our existence and writing our own history, but so is preserving these written histories. </p>

<h3>Setting Sail In America</h3>
<p>Lifelong sailors, Alan and his son Cory have been always been passionate about the sea. In 2005, the duo joined the classic racing circuit by purchasing <i>Firefly</i>, a 1926 S boat, which they campaign together. Alan is currently the Vice Commodore of the Narragansett Bay Herreshoff S Class Association. While Cory's photographic specialty is superyachts and the luxury lifestyle market, traveling the globe on assignment for highly renowned ship builders and dedicated owners, he began his career focusing on wooden boats.</p>
<p>""Captain Nat"" Herreshoff, who designed the S Class boat in 1919, is the most famous American yacht designer, with an accomplished history of boat building and innovation. From Bristol, Rhode Island, Herreshoff designed eight consecutive America's Cup defenders, from 1893-1934. The first owners of the S Class boats were also remarkable leaders of industry in the United States, and their stories are as intriguing as the boats are beautiful. </p>
<p>2019 marks the 100th Anniversary of the S Class design. <i>Setting Sail in America </i>is an homage to Class, and takes the reader on a compelling journey through the history of the S boat- a journey that visits milestones in American society, politics, business, and social life. The Herreshoff S Class is the oldest American one-design fleet still racing the original boats, with active fleets in Cape Cod, Long Island Sound, and Narragansett Bay.</p>
<h3> </h3>

</div><div>
<p>We are looking to raise $10,000 toward the editing, design, layout, and printing of the book. Should the book generate a profit, it will be donated to the Herreshoff Marine Museum, a 501c(3) nonprofit organization.</p>

<h3>About the Authors</h3>

We are looking to raise $10,000 toward the editing, design, layout, and printing of the book. Should the book generate a profit, it will be donated to the Herreshoff Marine Museum, a 501c(3) nonprofit organization.
The first 25 copies are a signed, limited Exclusive Edition, with a special case and printing upgrades, available for those supporters looking for a uniquely collectible volume. The next 250 copies are the Bristol Edition, each individually numbered and signed by the Silkens.

<h3>A könyv</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Miért maradt le az Egyesült Államok az űrversenyben? Valóban csak néhány másodpercen múlt Neil Armstrong élete egy űrutazáson a Holdra szállás előtt 3 évvel? Ha az <i>Apollo–1</i>-en kitört tűzben nem veszíti életét három űrhajósuk, a NASA talán soha nem jut el a Holdra?</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Gene Kranz</i></strong> lehet az egyik leghitelesebb forrás a fenti kérdések megválaszolására, hiszen az űrprogram kulcspozíciójában, a Houstoni Űrhajózási Központ repülésigazgatói (küldetésirányítói) székében ült a 60-70-es években. Mesél a hőskorról, a kezdeti kudarcokról és arról az elhivatottságról, amelynek köszönhetően a ma már megmosolyogtatónak tűnő műszaki fejlettségi színvonal mellett immáron 50 éve az emberiség máig is megdöntetlen csúcsteljesítményét vitték véghez. Természetesen külön fejezeteket szentel az első Holdra szállásnak és az <i>Apollo–13</i> küldetésének, amelyek sikerében, illetve megmentésében ő maga is elévülhetetlen érdemeket szerzett.</p>
<p>Hidegháború, űrtechnológia, kalandok, dráma, történelem és nem utolsósorban vezetéstudomány – mindezekről szól a könyv, több mint 400 oldalon keresztül. </p>

<h3>Az ötlet</h3>
<p>Másfél éve láttam egy filmet (<i>Az alapító</i>), ezután jutott eszembe, hogy a téma eredetijeként szolgáló könyvet – első ilyen projektemként – lefordítsam, és ha már lefordítottam, akkor saját kockázatomra ki is adjam. Ebből lett <i>A McDonald's sztori </i>című könyv, amelyről több információt itt találtok:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/amcdonaldssztori/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/amcdonaldssztori/</a></p>
<p>A kaland egészen jól sikerült, és most összeszedtem a bátorságomat, hogy folytassam. Bár végzettségem alapján szakfordító is vagyok, nem hivatásszerűen csinálom, csak hobbiként fordítok, illetve tanulási és vállalkozási tapasztalatszerzés miatt döntöttem a magánkiadás mellett.</p>
<p>A mostani téma, az űrutazás régi kedvencem: Verne könyvein, az <i>Alfa holdbáziso</i>n, az <i>Orion űrhajó</i>n és a <i>Csillagok háborújá</i>n nőttem fel, ráadásul a Holdra szállással szinte napra pontosan egyidős vagyok. A szerzőt, <strong>Gene Kranz</strong>t, a NASA houstoni űrhajózási központjának repülésigazgatóját egyik kedvenc filmemben fedeztem fel. Az <i>Apollo–13</i>-ban Ed Harris alakította, szerintem zseniálisan.</p>

<h3>1969 </h3>
<p>Ebben az évben szállt ember először a Holdra, ekkor születtem, és ebben az évben jelent meg az a cipőmodell (Onitsuka Cortez, lásd lent :-), amelynek lekoppintásával a Nike későbbi világhódítását köszönheti. És ennyi darabból áll a LEGO tavaly kiadott szettje, az Apollo űrhajókat pályára állító <i>Saturn–V</i> hordozórakéta, amelyet kisfiammal egy álló napon keresztül raktunk össze... Szerencsére a családban eredeti sajtórelikviák sokasága is megmaradt 1969-ből, amelyeket most mind fel tudok használni szakirodalomként.  </p>

<h3>Mi a terv és mi is ez az Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>Az eredeti mű jogtulajdonosától megvásároltam a magyar fordítás és kiadás jogát.</p>
<p>Ezen és a fordításba beletett néhány száz munkaórán túl szükség van egy szerkesztő-lektorra, aki nyelvhelyességi és stilisztikai szempontból gatyába rázza a szöveget. A szakmai szöveg pontosságára nagyon ügyelek, komolyan beleásom magam a témába, de jó, ha a végén valaki segít egyeztetni az alanyt és az állítmányt...:-)</p>
<p>Szükség van egy tördelőre, aki a nyers dokumentumból profi módon könyvformátumot készít. Egy grafikusra, aki segít megtervezni a borítót. Aztán egy korrektorra, aki a nyomdakésznek hitt anyagot még egyszer átrágja, és kijavítja a még megbúvó hibákat.</p>
<p>És végül egy nyomdára, aki papírt és festéket nem kímélve létrehozza a könyvet.</p>
<p>A fordításon kívül ezeket a tevékenységeket a kiadók szokták elvégeztetni és finanszírozni, de ebben az esetben ezt mind-mind én fogom megszervezni és megcsináltatni.</p>
<p><i>Az Indiegogo ahhoz ad felületet, hogy egy születőben, folyamatban lévő projektet az ötletgazda bemutathasson, és ezen keresztül találjon érdeklődőket, akik – általában – a termék előzetes megvásárlásával szavaznak bizalmat a projektnek, és egyben beszállnak az így már közösséginek nevezhető finanszírozásba.</i></p>
<p><strong>Ha segítetek nekem a könyv előzetes megvásárlásával, kicsit enyhítetek az előfinanszírozási terheimen, hozzájárulásotokat pedig a megjelenés előtt átadott könyvekkel, kedvezményekkel és exkluzív ajándékok felajánlásával hálálom meg. A lap jobb szélén felsorolt csomagokból tudtok válogatni.</strong></p>
<p>A vásárláshoz nem kell regisztrálni, illetve eldönthetitek, hogy a kampány publikus oldalán a támogatók között fel legyen-e tüntetve a nevetek, vagy sem.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Ha csak egy könyvet olvastok el az űrhajózásról, miért ez legyen az?</h3>
<p>A mostanában megjelenő könyvek nem ennyire átfogóak: az <i>Első ember</i> csak Neil Armstrongról szól, a <i>Rakétaemberek</i> csak az <i>Apollo–8</i>-ról. Gene Kranz viszont mesél a hőskorról, a Mercury-programról, a kezdeti kudarcokról, a szovjetekkel folyó rivalizálásról, az első emberes fellövésekről, az Irányítóközpont munkájáról és a Gemini-programon keresztül fordul rá az Apollo-küldetésekre. Ráadásul az <i>Első ember</i> egyik megnevezett forrása éppen Kranz könyve.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's my offer of quid-pro-quo / I'm not asking for a handout, I work hard, and I'll trade you my productions for your hard earned income:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm raising funds to finish my book ""The Truth About the Rothschilds: A Manual of Resources and References Pertaining to the Rothschild Family Banking Dynasty"", the funds will be used to finish the remaining chapters (which I've spent the past year researching), proof-read, create the index, and get the first edition into print and to the public.</li>
<li>Concurrent to finishing the book, I'm also seeking to produce my next filmed interview for my ""Future of Freedom"" documentary project, and the costs of production include (but not limited to) location expenses, travel, crew fees, post-production editing, and sound mastering. I do most of the work myself, but when I'm short on time and have the funds I do like to pay professionals to help me attain the highest levels of production value - the audience appreciates it.</li>
<li>As far as what you get- it's a combination of past productions &amp; exclusive art and subscriber only content, as well as access to the various versions of the book, the next filmed interview, and my attitude of gratitude.</li>
<li>My perks/thank you gifts for contributors aren't reliant on my reaching the total goal for this fundraiser - I always figure out how to get things done regardless - and most of the perks are independent of the fundraiser so if I only raise a % of the goal you'll still win and be satisfied.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The concept of individual liberty is in jeopardy, not just here in America, but all across the planet. Contributing to the educational resources I generate will help enrich the lives of others - last year individuals from 186 countries viewed my productions - where else can you achieve such reach for such a reasonable price? (...and you get perks!)</p>
<ul>
<li>I focus on methodologies of freedom rather than ideologies of control.</li>
<li>I've funded my film productions over the past 12 years with individual fundraisers just like this, I've always exceeded my goals and over-delivered to my audience.</li>
<li>There's no risk, just reward... the perks are all worth more than my asking price.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Earlier this year I became a father, which has presented the challenge of having enough time to meet my expectations of productivity - the balance to this is that I'm even more motivated to do the best I can to explore, research, and produce the highest level of quality content... and it keeps getting easier the more I apply myself.</p>
<ul>
<li>I realize that there are always ""unknowns"" and ""challenges"" to any project, and knowing this I consistently improvise, adapt, and overcome because failure is not an option when it comes to defending Cognitive Liberty and Individual Freedom.</li>
<li>When I encounter challenges I can't overcome, I step back to see what I need to learn in order to make progress, then I re-strategize, re-negotiate with my audience, and I keep moving forward. Life's not fair, and it's not easy, but with patience, persistence, and a lot of elbow grease, life and be very rewarding.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>

<h3>(journal entry 6/20/2008)</h3>
<p>""Hello. For those that are not aware, Meghan was diagnosed in September with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. It is a rare, aggressive and cowardly disease, attacking children mostly in the age range of 3-10.  Approximately 200 cases in US are diagnosed each year and over 90% will die within 18 months of diagnosis. Surgery is not an option because of the location (Pons area which controls basic vital functions) and the diffuse nature of the tumor (infiltrated into normal cells). In almost all cases, it's not even biopsied because the risks outweigh the benefits. Conventional medicine is offering us limited options and very little hope, forcing us to incorporate and turn to alternative methods. There is no cure for DIPG, conventional or otherwise. There's only the hope of buying time. Days, months, and hopefully, years. And living with acceptable quality of life.</p>
<p>People tell me they admire my strength in keeping my family strong through this. But it is  Meghan that's moving us forward. Last week was a very bad week for us and the closest I've been to despair since September.  As I bent down to tie her shoelaces, I started crying, thinking of the things, big and small, this disease is taking from her. She reached down and patted my head, and <u><i><strong>reassured me</strong></i>,</u> and told me that everything will be alright. She's an incredibly giving person and how blessed am I to be her mom?! </p>
<p>And so we are in Arizona. With our cats, Bonnie and Clyde (Meghan loves people's reactions when she tells them their names) and Ginger Rogers three! We were able to bring the cats onto the cabin as carry-ons.  We had to pay $100 each. Ginger is too big to be considered carry-on and so I had the doctors write a letter stating that Ginger is needed as an emotional support dog.  She sat on Meghan's lap and performed her job beautifully.</p>
<p>I am attaching the clip of Meghan during take off. It's the first time on a plane for her and Isabel. It's been about 12 years since Santo and I flew. The loud meowing you hear is Clyde, the big baby. So, that's it for now. Please forward this to anyone that may be interested in our progress. Keep us, and all the DIPG families, in your thoughts and prayers. Especially me. I pray for strength."" </p>

<p><span>Hi Readers!</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Once upon a time, </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I worked at the Library in my hometown for a span. There I discovered some excellent literature coming out for children about LGBT relationships. These were things like ""Sarah Has Two Daddies!"" which teaches children how to deal with their confusion or how to explain non-traditional parents. </span><br/></p>
<p>What I didn't see were books where the characters happen to be gay....and that isn't the plot point of the book. It isn't the problem, or a thing that needs to be overcome. Nowhere was gay shown as just..normal.</p>
<p>Dealing with our troubled feelings about change is an important part of growth, yet there comes a time when calling things to attention merely highlights it as Other. In light of this, the goal of NFT is to portray characters who just so happen to be LGBT. </p>
<p>In addition, we'll will portray sensitive and caring men, powerful women, relationships built on trust, people of color in positions of power, integration of cultures, attractiveness not being automatically positive or redeeming and more. </p>
<p>The more I write, the more I realize...there's a lot to do to bring classic Fairytales into the 21st century!</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434612972/ovqq2rpxv6ht5bgayqng.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>So Here's The Breakdown:</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>The format will be a short children's illustrated chapter book. </span></p>
<p>Caya Berndt has joined me as the artist that will bring this vision to life. She believes in the message and has the heart to bring it across. </p>
<p>Cinderella, the first book, is completely written and the main character concepts are drawn. Caya needs time to bring the art to life, as well as art materials($200). </p>
<p>Once completely finished, we will need to pay for an editing service($30-$40/hour) and we will need to pay for a formatting service ($45-$85/hour). </p>
<p>Before it goes to mass print, we intend to send the book in digital format to a (TBD) cultural group to check out how we did on not being accidentally racist. (We understand our privilege of being two white chicks, and we want these books to feel welcoming for everyone).</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>There's also: copyrighting and registering costs, travel and lodging to send Amanda around the Northwest shopping the book and also, a website for the New Fairy Tales business and a content map/plan for six months. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p></p>Then finally, it's the cost of printing and distribution and away we go! (Printing will be about $1500 per 100 if printed from bookbaby, but we are going to try to get it cheaper!)<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434613070/xdkaf1okdehbiqxmrbz5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>LGBT youth suffer pain and violence at an astonishing rate. <br/></p>
<p>According to info from Youth Risk Behavior Surveys done during 2001‒2009, the percentage of LGBT students  who were threatened or harmed with a weapon on school property ranged from 12% to 28%. Not to mention...</p>
<ul>
<li>19% to 29% of gay and lesbian students and 18% to 28% of bisexual students experienced dating violence in the previous year.</li>
<li>14% to 31% of gay and lesbian students and 17% to 32% of bisexual students had been forced to have sexual intercourse at some point in their lives.</li>
<li>LGTBTQ youth are also at increased risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts. Queer kids are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers. One study also showed that an astonishing 25% of transgender youth had attempted suicide. </li>
</ul>
<div>Our children are dying. Our children are hurting. They are hurting because they feel like they are different, somehow less than, their heterosexual peers. They deserve to see their own stories reflected in media. They deserve our time and our art. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434613032/b9h21qdtjtbxtkzkdq3i.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 463.907660020986px; height: 872px;""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are several challenges with this project:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Social pressure: This campaign and the subsequent art and books will undoubtedly be protested by strong objectors that will attempt to ban us from libraries and schools. </li>
<li>Printing costs: Without printing in bulk, the costs are much higher. </li>
<li>Distribution and networking: We need to get the word out for this project. <br/>
</li>
<li>Is it gonna be any good?</li>
</ul>
<div>Let's take these challenges one at a time.</div>
<div>Social pressure: It is critical that people are willing to stand up for what they believe in, especially in defense of their children. This project and these artists WILL NOT back down in the face of adversity, so don't worry about that. <br/><br/>Printing costs: Currently the cost of printing is estimated at what we consider to be our maximum selling cost. $15/book is even higher than we want to go. We want this literature to be affordable. I believe that by having a large support network from this campaign, we will have the negotiating power to drive down our costs to a more reasonable level. <br/><br/>Distribution and networking: Amanda runs fantasy/sci-fi literature conventions in her spare time and has worked with the city libraries in her area. She has created a network of contacts that can help her get the word out on this project, effectively leaping over the exposure challenge.<br/><br/>Is it gonna be any good: Caya's art, demonstrated here, is an example of the quickie sketches that she worked up in her free time. She is an art student at Spokane Community College and has been accepted to the Savannah College of Art and Design. Amanda is an experienced writer with credits in National Indie magazines, both fiction and non-fiction. Together they have the experience and passion to make a product that we can all be proud of. </div>

<div>
<b>Caya Berndt</b> is an incredible artists who's concept work that you see throughout this page speaks for itself. I had a heck of a time finding the right artist for this project. Some were offended, others were simply not the passionate hearts who believed in this work. </div>

</div></div>","We are: New Fairy Tales!



 
Hi Readers!
Once upon a time, I worked at the Library in my hometown for a span. There I discovered some excellent literature coming out for children about LGBT relationships. These were things like ""Sarah Has Two Daddies!"" which teaches children how to deal with their confusion or how to explain non-traditional parents. 
What I didn't see were books where the characters happen to be gay....and that isn't the plot point of the book. It isn't the problem, or a thing that needs to be overcome. Nowhere was gay shown as just..normal.
Dealing with our troubled feelings about change is an important part of growth, yet there comes a time when calling things to attention merely highlights it as Other. In light of this, the goal of NFT is to portray characters who just so happen to be LGBT. 
In addition, we'll will portray sensitive and caring men, powerful women, relationships built on trust, people of color in positions of power, integration of cultures, attractiveness not being automatically positive or redeeming and more. 
The more I write, the more I realize...there's a lot to do to bring classic Fairytales into the 21st century!



   So Here's The Breakdown: 
The format will be a short children's illustrated chapter book. 
Caya Berndt has joined me as the artist that will bring this vision to life. She believes in the message and has the heart to bring it across. 
Cinderella, the first book, is completely written and the main character concepts are drawn. Caya needs time to bring the art to life, as well as art materials($200). 
Once completely finished, we will need to pay for an editing service($30-$40/hour) and we will need to pay for a formatting service ($45-$85/hour). 
Before it goes to mass print, we intend to send the book in digital format to a (TBD) cultural group to check out how we did on not being accidentally racist. (We understand our privilege of being two white chicks, and we want these books to feel welcoming for everyone).

There's also: copyrighting and registering costs, travel and lodging to send Amanda around the Northwest shopping the book and also, a website for the New Fairy Tales business and a content map/plan for six months.  
Then finally, it's the cost of printing and distribution and away we go! (Printing will be about $1500 per 100 if printed from bookbaby, but we are going to try to get it cheaper!)


  The Impact 


LGBT youth suffer pain and violence at an astonishing rate. 
According to info from Youth Risk Behavior Surveys done during 2001‒2009, the percentage of LGBT students  who were threatened or harmed with a weapon on school property ranged from 12% to 28%. Not to mention...

19% to 29% of gay and lesbian students and 18% to 28% of bisexual students experienced dating violence in the previous year.
14% to 31% of gay and lesbian students and 17% to 32% of bisexual students had been forced to have sexual intercourse at some point in their lives.
LGTBTQ youth are also at increased risk of suicidal thoughts and attempts. Queer kids are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers. One study also showed that an astonishing 25% of transgender youth had attempted suicide. 

Our children are dying. Our children are hurting. They are hurting because they feel like they are different, somehow less than, their heterosexual peers. They deserve to see their own stories reflected in media. They deserve our time and our art. 





    Risks & Challenges There are several challenges with this project:

Social pressure: This campaign and the subsequent art and books will undoubtedly be protested by strong objectors that will attempt to ban us from libraries and schools. 
Printing costs: Without printing in bulk, the costs are much higher. 
Distribution and networking: We need to get the word out for this project. 

Is it gonna be any good?

Let's take these challenges one at a time.
Social pressure: It is critical that people are willing to stand up for what they believe in, especially in defense of their children. This project and these artists WILL NOT back down in the face of adversity, so don't worry about that. Printing costs: Currently the cost of printing is estimated at what we consider to be our maximum selling cost. $15/book is even higher than we want to go. We want this literature to be affordable. I believe that by having a large support network from this campaign, we will have the negotiating power to drive down our costs to a more reasonable level. Distribution and networking: Amanda runs fantasy/sci-fi literature conventions in her spare time and has worked with the city libraries in her area. She has created a network of contacts that can help her get the word out on this project, effectively leaping over the exposure challenge.Is it gonna be any good: Caya's art, demonstrated here, is an example of the quickie sketches that she worked up in her free time. She is an art student at Spokane Community College and has been accepted to the Savannah College of Art and Design. Amanda is an experienced writer with credits in National Indie magazines, both fiction and non-fiction. Together they have the experience and passion to make a product that we can all be proud of. 



Who the Heck are You?


...and what makes you think you can do a good job? 

I am Amanda Baldwin and I have had short stories and articles published in independent magazines for about three years now. I have done work writing boring things like training manuals and instructions for business practices, as well as managing social media presences for many small businesses. I have also done MCing and interviews for people like Wendy and Richard Pini(Elfquest), Kaja Foglio (Girl Genius), and voice actor Chuck Huber (Andriod 17). 
I also happen to have lots of connections among fantasy/sci fi conventions in the Northwest area and once the books are finished, I have connections to help me broadcast the signal and make them more likely to be a success. I am also the founder and acting President of the Northwest Nerd Alliance, a group dedicated to redefining an inclusive definition of what being a nerd/geek/dork means. 
With capabilities in social media and online marketing, my writing skills, experience in advocacy and pre-existing connections, I think this book has a good chance of success! 


Caya Berndt is an incredible artists who's concept work that you see throughout this page speaks for itself. I had a heck of a time finding the right artist for this project. Some were offended, others were simply not the passionate hearts who believed in this work. 
Caya has been drawing since she was a wee lass, and she is largely self taught. Her style is flexible and deft, inspired by by sequential art, comics, 90s animation, and classical illustrators like Chris Van Allsberg and Bill Watterson. Subtle character aspects that were imbued through writing she has brought to life, better than ever imagined. A newly accepted student of Savannah College of Art and Design, she is the right lady for the job and with her talent, we can tackle this critical undertaking to leave a positive legacy for our children. Caya likes cats and is an accomplished Jazz Soloist.



Alexandra Baldwin is a real life five year old with enough sass to spare. She is a Sci-fi convention costume contest winner for her rendition of the 10th Doctor and a lover of Fantasy, Sci-fi, books, and Princesses. Her favorite color is everything and her favorite TV show is My Little Pony. Lexi will serve as our product tester. As a genuine five year old fantasy lover, she is well qualified. You should know that she has read the stories and thinks they're awesome, so you can take that to the bank!



Stretch Goals! 

If we exceed our goals, the first thing we will be is SUPER DUPER excited. Next, we will rally ourselves for more awesomeness! 
$7,000We can do a round of hardback copies too! We all know kidlets are hard on their books! At this level, Caya and Amanda will record podcasts and videos documenting their creative process.
$9,000Caya and Amanda will be able to dedicate more of their time to creating the next two tales: Rose and Thorn and Voice of the Sea. We also will be able to donate copies to local school and public libraries to make this literature more accessible.
15,000Printing costs for the next two books are covered! Travel and book donations will expand their reach!
25,000If there is this much interest in this project, we'll open New Fairytales as an NPO that will produce LGBT and other diverse stories. Hiring for new artists and story writers will begin, as well as possible collaboration for Young Adult stories, comic books and more.

<p>Sadie is a mongrel... a mutt... a MESS! After Sadie is rescued from the local shelter, she finds a home with the Kramer's; a loving family of three; and that's when life gets really interesting.</p>
<p>Big Mouth is Sadie's arch-nemesis. A tall, plastic, greedy fellow that lives in the kitchen and gets all the good food that Sadie wants. Join Sadie on her adventures of learning about the world, food, jealousy, fear, and most of all love.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning of Sadie's adventures! ""Sadie Vs. Big Mouth"" is the first in a series of books that will answer some of kids' common questions like ""If my family loves me, why don't they let me do or have what I want?"" and ""If I'm scared of something, why do I have to be brave?""</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>Sadie is an ebook already (on sale at Amazon, B&amp;N, and Smashwords) and so what we're looking to do from here is to make it more official and get printed.

We'll donate about 50 of these to high profile people (celebrities and such who will tweet about it, spread the word, etc) and the other 100 will be sold to try to make enough to print more copies.</li>
<li>At $5500 we can print 300 copies and get it in some local stores here in SC and donate to libraries and schools.</li>
<li>Of course anything beyond this will just be expanding the territory in which we can distribute.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<div>Everyone who gives $2 or more will get a copy of the eBook. That makes it a 99cent savings from purchasing it online. Unfortunately we cannot offer very many fancy rewards other than the ebook which is already done, because unless we raise enough to print, we won't have a book at all to offer. What we can say is that if we surpass our goal, we will be trying to get a little something in the mail to you guys. We promise we'll do as much as we can because we appreciate your support so greatly!</div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>Well, this is our third fundraising project launched and so a challenge is to raise enough funds to make this happen. The last times though we were trying to raise enough for a full printing run. This time we have different levels of things we can achieve with just parts of the money (we mistakenly used Kickstarter the other times, so we got none of the money). We won't forget the people who backed us the first 2 times around and we look forward to sending Sadie into your lives and the lives of the children you know! <br/>There is really no risk involved for YOU. the backers, because the book is already written and illustrated completely and we are very responsible, dependable, and punctual people, so as soon as we hit each level, we'll be moving along! </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p> <ul> <li>PLEASE get the word out and make some noise about Sadie!<br/>

We'll donate about 50 of these to high profile people (celebrities and such who will tweet about it, spread the word, etc) and the other 100 will be sold to try to make enough to print more copies.
At $5500 we can print 300 copies and get it in some local stores here in SC and donate to libraries and schools.
Of course anything beyond this will just be expanding the territory in which we can distribute.


    
What You Get
Everyone who gives $2 or more will get a copy of the eBook. That makes it a 99cent savings from purchasing it online. Unfortunately we cannot offer very many fancy rewards other than the ebook which is already done, because unless we raise enough to print, we won't have a book at all to offer. What we can say is that if we surpass our goal, we will be trying to get a little something in the mail to you guys. We promise we'll do as much as we can because we appreciate your support so greatly!
Risks and Challenges
 Well, this is our third fundraising project launched and so a challenge is to raise enough funds to make this happen. The last times though we were trying to raise enough for a full printing run. This time we have different levels of things we can achieve with just parts of the money (we mistakenly used Kickstarter the other times, so we got none of the money). We won't forget the people who backed us the first 2 times around and we look forward to sending Sadie into your lives and the lives of the children you know! There is really no risk involved for YOU. the backers, because the book is already written and illustrated completely and we are very responsible, dependable, and punctual people, so as soon as we hit each level, we'll be moving along!   Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  PLEASE get the word out and make some noise about Sadie!
 There are some share tools on here that can be used.
Every little bit does help, even a dollar or two.

</div></div>","When I shot this group breastfeeding portrait in June of this year, I had no idea of the great response I would get, and I loved working with all the beautiful families involved.
 Included was a mom who bottle-fed her baby donated breast milk, a mom who tandem nursed, moms of newborns and toddlers. 

 I've since been asked to shoot more group shots, as well as solo ones. I'm shooting the group sessions at no charge and the solo sessions with a small retainer ($50 versus my regular portrait fee of $225 and $400) and would like to thank them all (past and future subjects) by being able to provide them each with a 12x18 in. archival print (different than the poster listed in the perks) of the group portrait from the session(s) they participate in.
With each session shot, I hear more and more ideas of what needs to happen with this series- it started with a show, then a book, now a show AND a book. I'm humbled by the amazing response, but also a mom who's finances primarily start and stop with the needs of my children. So here I am, asking for you to join these amazing women, their children and I!

   What I Need & What You Get
 Some of the perks for donating are my undying gratitude!, posters, prints, signed copies of the book, even your own session to be used as for a nursing portrait, family session, head shot, and more!
I'm hopeful that I'll reach my goal to meet the initial print run. If, however, I do not meet this goal, my first responsibility is to provide those thank you prints to my subjects. Any additional funding left would go to the continuation of this portrait project- setting up a dedicated website and more shoots in anticipation of when the time comes that I can have a beautiful show.
   The Impact All the time, I'm hearing moms share their painful experience of being shamed for doing what comes natural to us. The relationship between mother and child shouldn't be cause for stigma, especially when the mother is providing the most basic need of nutrition for her child. I hope this series helps normalize breastfeeding because the more we share our journeys as breastfeeding moms and the more normal breastfeeding becomes in society and the less women will be shamed for it. Not having shame attached to something so natural contributes to a healthy emotional balance for mom, which will helps contribute to the bond between mother and child.

Civil Unions for Homo-sapians - Separate and Equal for different Lifestyles
God-given right to bare teeth - No to overly-restrictive muzzle and leash laws
Taxes: Pay Less, Get More - More Savings, More Governmenting

 Nugget needs your love, your nurturing, and your support. But most importantly, like all political candidates, Nugget needs your money. And lots of it.
Nugget needs your donations for serious and important reasons, such as:  Making stickers, buttons, magnets, tote bags, tshirts, hats, and lawn signs

Nugget needs campaign materials and television commercials that an disrupt the other candidates. But first of all, we must fight with everything we have to get Nugget's name on the ballot.

Overcoming anti-Canine prejudice
Our team faces many obstacles that other more well-connected campaigns 
do not, such as:



Prejudice against canine candidates
Colorblindness

Not having opposable thumbs.

The Nugget team believes we can overcome every single one of these challenges because Nugget believes in Americans like you. 
Our opponents have already begun spreading rumors that Nugget has been caught eating out of the trash, drinking out of the toilet, and sitting on the couch when no one is in the room. 
Nugget's supporters know these claims and others like it to be absolutely libelous and entirely untrue.
Some have even asked Nugget, ""why not start smaller? why not run for congress?""


For Nugget, this is a once-in-a-lifetime election.
    Poor folks can help too!
 Are you totally broke? Nugget understands. He is too.
That's why we are calling all artists and creative-types of all kinds to share their talents and help bring Nugget into the spotlight and into the hearts of all Americans.

<div>In a post-apocalyptic world, where an evil entity by the name of Jorne reigns his baneful wrath for blood lust and domination, stirring up an unrelenting coalition between three of the world's most harmonious nations to sign a contract --allowing Jorne to unleash some of his influence onto the army known as the Jortori. This contract was specifically formed by three very powerful men, a representative from each country, to rule the Jortori army in Jorne's place. The majority of the human race found sanctuary among the stars --with a promise to one day return. Among the handful of those left behind is a young girl by the name of Aleta Rose. Aleta and the remaing population were forced to come out of hiding to learn what true innate abilities really are, and to begin a revolt against the Jortori in order to save their home. Valcan, a Jortori leader, launched a grueling attack on Aleta's village when she was eight. Aleta, being the only survivor from the tragedy, was forced to live in the wilderness in order to survive. After nine years of living in utter isolation, Aleta, and her two wolves, are faced with the heart-stopping news of the Jortori's return to her home land. When it can't seem to get much worse, she is taken to a hidden military base, concealed in the mountains. Scared and confused in her new surroundings, Aleta learns that this is no ordinary military base. Everyone is acting strange and treating her like some disease ridden animal. The secrets and lies pile on top of each other as Aleta isn't only forced to figure out what causes her panic episodes that paralyze her body in the midst of anger but just what kind of secrets are these people not telling her?</div>

</div><div><i>""Don't shoot!"" Fain ran in shouting. But it was too late, someone shot. Gun fire went off in rounds behind me so quickly that it was almost unison. I turned and looked down, Kale stood in the far corner of the room with his gun pointed directly at my head. I tilted my head at the three bullets floating in front of my face and shook my head with disappointment. I inhaled and exhaled, sending the bullets back in the direction they came. Kale dropped. Gave immediately left his post and bolted across the room toward Kale, sliding on his knees on approach. Stop. My heart skipped a beat and for a split second I felt a pang of guilt for the damage I've caused. But I quickly abolished the foreign feeling altogether. However, in that split second of being distracted I was knocked so hard with a force that sent me spiraling into a wall. As I sat up out of the ruble, Rayden was on me, forcing me back down with an animalistic hand at my throat. Ah, his ability. His face hovered just above mine and I starred up at him solemnly and calm. The white's of his eyes grew bright red and the veins in his neck and forehead protruded so far out of his skin that I could count his heart beat. He flared his nostrils as he blew hot air onto my face. </i></div><div><i>""I should kill you right now,"" his voice came from deep within his chest, almost like a growl as his hand tightened around my neck, pushing against my wind pipe. I smiled up at him, </i></div><div><i>""Do it."" Though his face didn't show it, I could smell his fear and I drank it in like the greatest perfume the world had to offer.

Then he was gone. </i></div><div><i>Fain was there in a flash yanking him off by the back of his shirt and throwing him on the ground. ""Control your self!"" He yelled down at Rayden, who did nothing but give him a pissed off glare. Blood trickled down his right forearm, pooling up on the ground beneath his dripping fingers. He forced his attention off of Fain and toward his wounded arm. I rose up behind Fain, smiling at myself for the plan I had in mind for him. Trying not to be too amused by the turned tables. Then pain suddenly erupted in my right shoulder and I collapsed to my knees. I watched my blood spill onto the floor in front of me until I could see the shine of my glowing ice, blue eyes starring back at me in the reflection. Intrigued, I dipped my finger tips in the blood and curiously rubbed my fingers together, feeling the warm sensation against my ice cold skin. I sat up, starring at my fingers, fascinated. Then I heard a click and looked up to find the barrel of Sarge's gun starring me in the face. I smiled. </i></div><div>
<i>""Knock it off,"" Sarge yelled, cold cocking me in the back of the head with the handle of his gun. I fell forward to the palm of my hands again and more blood splurged out of my shoulder, splattering onto the floor and the side of my cheek. Rage surged through me and I titled my head up until I could make eye contact with him. He made a poor decision. A poor decision with poor consequences. I lifted my hand up and Sarge's gun flew into the wall to our left causing a random bullet to be shot. It went flying into precarious directions - with a mortal at each corner of the room. I pushed myself back onto my knees, feeling light headed and weak. I assessed my wound - which was still bleeding profusely. So I lifted my hand to apply pressure before I bled out. He didn't hit anything vital but I assume he, ignorantly, did that on purpose. I grabbed onto the side of the broken wall with my free hand and pulled my heavy body to it's feet. Fain was there trying to assist and I flung my hand out to push him away. But he didn't go. So I shrugged him off and stumbled forward. Losing more blood with every step. Rayden stood up to block my path but I saw his eyes flicker to something behind me and he stepped aside, grumbling. I turned in a slow circle, looking for my next targ</i><i style=""background-color: initial;"">et when I saw Gave still knelt at Kale's side looking just as weak as ever.

I could feel blood trickling out of the corner of my mouth and I licked it away as I turned my lips upward into a smirk. </i>
</div><div><i>""Time to play,"" I sang, stepping forward, blacking out with every other step as I lost more blood from the awkward movement. </i></div><div><i>""Why are you doing this?"" He asked.

<p>Movement creates cities. This innovative publication uses <i>movement</i> as a conceptual device through which to read Johannesburg. Functioning as both a <b>guide to visitors and a resource to residents</b>, the books re-read the historical and contemporary <b>forces that continue to shape Johannesburg</b>. Notable authors, academics, photographers, researchers, designers and artists have interpreted the cities through their <i>movement</i>. The book explores fraught histories, poetically questions contemporary decisions, and critically reflects on social change.

<h3>WHAT IS MOVEMENT JOHANNESBURG?</h3>
<p>Movement Johannesburg is an <b>urban anthology</b>, an exploration of the movements that have created Johannesburg and continue to shape the city. <b>The book offers a diverse set of essays, interviews, photo essays, maps, and photographs</b> that attempt to capture the complex histories and realities of movement (n.) and movement (v.) in the city. The publication will, in particular, <b>reward the curious individual interested in the forces that shaped Johannesburg</b> today looking for in-depth accounts but also lighter travel reading. Crafted through specially commissioned contributions from architects, academics, artists, photographers, urbanists, activists and thought leaders all passionate and knowledgeable about the movements of Johannesburg – past and present, <b>Movement Johannesburg is both an accomplished reading of the city, but also a warm introduction to vibrant Johannesburg.</b></p>

Movement creates cities. This innovative publication uses movement as a conceptual device through which to read Johannesburg. Functioning as both a guide to visitors and a resource to residents, the books re-read the historical and contemporary forces that continue to shape Johannesburg. Notable authors, academics, photographers, researchers, designers and artists have interpreted the cities through their movement. The book explores fraught histories, poetically questions contemporary decisions, and critically reflects on social change. We are using the crowd funding movement as a means to complete the production of the book.

Our mixes of race, culture, socioeconomics, and religion--among our many other mixes!--give us unique experiences, perspectives, and inspiration. But (as any mixed person knows) our mixes have the ability to confuse the heck out ourselves, as well as other people. And we want to change that. People now are more mixed than ever, in every way. We want to create a platform that celebrates all kinds of mixes.</p>
<h2>OUR MASTER PLAN</h2>
<h3>WHERE WE ARE</h3>
<p>We've mapped and started designing out our first issue, we've connected with 7 amazing contributors (some of whom made us cry with their touching content), we held an interactive event in Washington Square Park, we've built relationships with other amazing indie print magazines, we've started talking to stockists, we've honed in on our concept, designed a logo, produced a video...

<h3>What Makes This Novel Unique?</h3>
<p>As a producer in television news, I spent my entire career working at the broadcast networks.    </p>
<p>I started at the bottom as a desk assistant and worked my way to the top, where I created and <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">managed the weekly newsmagazine, Dateline NBC.  That journey took two decades, and to get </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">there, I had to learn the business from the bottom up.  I spent years working as a researcher, an </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">assistant producer, an associate producer, an operations producer, a line producer, a segment </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">producer, and a senior producer, before being named the executive producer of my own </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">broadcast.  Needless to say, I used personal anecdotes from each of these production </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">experiences to create the storyline for Live to Air.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So the characters, while fictional, are based on the professionals I met---encapsulating the </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">quirks, strengths, and weaknesses of the creative people who made up my world of broadcast </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">news.  Ethan Benson combines the strengths, weaknesses, and foibles of many of my </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">colleagues---not to mention the bits of me that run through his character---and his adventures </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">in the book mirror the adventures in my own career.  They’re authentic, but imaginary, and </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">steeped in the real life of drug dealers, rapists, and murderers I investigated during my years as a television journalist. </span></p>
<p>So why did I write Live to Air and why should you support my fundraising campaign?  The <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">answer to both those questions is simple.  Murder mysteries are both fascinating and </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">engrossing---a way to lose oneself in an imaginary world of villains and heroes and heroines.  </span></p>

Live to Air is a tale of murder and intrigue, love and violence, hope and despair.  Its hero, Ethan Benson, is a savvy, award-winning producer with a keen nose for news who works for “The Weekly Reporter,” the top rated newsmagazine on television.  Assigned to what appears to be a straight forward story about the high-powered murder of an innocent young socialite, the daughter of the deputy mayor of New York, Ethan embarks on a journey, surrounded by a cast of memorable characters to unravel the truth hidden by the powers to be who’ve viciously schemed to frame a hot-headed young hoodlum.  
My novel is a classic murder mystery, filled with suspense and built against the backdrop of the television news business.  Ethan takes you behind the scenes as he digs into the killer’s criminal past and discovers---through a series of twists and turns---a devious scheme hatched by the prosecutor and the public defender who twist the facts and manipulate the jury to make sure the fall guy is found guilty.  Then, in a surprise ending, Ethan reveals---through his hard work and determination---the role of a powerful government official who’s hiding a dark secret that threatens to destroy his political future.
Peppered with car chases, gun battles, and contract hit men, my novel takes its place in the pantheon of crime thrillers.  Ethan is a flawed but powerful protagonist---much like Michael Connelly’s Mickey Haller, John Sanderson’s Lucas Davenport, and James Patterson’s Alex Cross.  But unlike most heroes or antiheros in this genre of fiction who work as attorneys, private investigators, or homicide detectives, Ethan is a television news producer who uses the tools of reporting to seek out the truth as a crime fighting sleuth.  Live to Air is a classic murder mystery with unforgettable characters set in a milieu rarely explored in other works of fiction and the first in a series of Ethan Benson thrillers.      
What Makes This Novel Unique?
As a producer in television news, I spent my entire career working at the broadcast networks.    
I started at the bottom as a desk assistant and worked my way to the top, where I created and managed the weekly newsmagazine, Dateline NBC.  That journey took two decades, and to get there, I had to learn the business from the bottom up.  I spent years working as a researcher, an assistant producer, an associate producer, an operations producer, a line producer, a segment producer, and a senior producer, before being named the executive producer of my own broadcast.  Needless to say, I used personal anecdotes from each of these production experiences to create the storyline for Live to Air.  
So the characters, while fictional, are based on the professionals I met---encapsulating the quirks, strengths, and weaknesses of the creative people who made up my world of broadcast news.  Ethan Benson combines the strengths, weaknesses, and foibles of many of my colleagues---not to mention the bits of me that run through his character---and his adventures in the book mirror the adventures in my own career.  They’re authentic, but imaginary, and steeped in the real life of drug dealers, rapists, and murderers I investigated during my years as a television journalist. 
So why did I write Live to Air and why should you support my fundraising campaign?  The answer to both those questions is simple.  Murder mysteries are both fascinating and engrossing---a way to lose oneself in an imaginary world of villains and heroes and heroines.  

But most murder mysteries in today’s marketplace feature homicide detectives, lawyers, and private investigators as their protagonists. My novel is different because it is built around a hero who's fighting crime using the same tools as a real life reporter. This makes Live to Air  a gripping read, and Ethan Benson an iconic hero.  The book is a page turner, and the first in a series of crime thrillers that will captivate the imagination of readers of all ages. 
Here’s What Others Say About Live to Air
 “Jeff has translated his twenty-five years as one of television’s leading investigative reporters into a twisting and turning murder mystery that will keep you riveted.” – Av Westin, former Vice President, ABC News Creative Development
“His characters are charismatic, devious, and frightening---straight out of the annals of the best murder mysteries.” -- Deborah Roberts, Correspondent, ABC News
“Ethan Benson is a new kind of hero cast in the role of crime-fighting sleuth.  Sensitive and insecure, dogged and determined, sharp-witted and loving, he refuses to take no for an answer as he strives to uncover the truth.” – Al Roker, Host and Weatherman, NBC News Today Show
“His plotline unfolds masterfully as it tracks his hero pulling back the layers and skillfully chronicling each stage of newsmagazine production, deftly revealing the storyline as Ethan takes the reader on a wild journey producing his story.” – David Sloan, Senior Executive Producer, ABC News 20/20
“Jeff and I spent years working together at 20/20 and his novel captures the essence of storytelling and the art of the interview…The book is sharp and fast-paced, a real page turner that will hold your attention right down to the chilling climax.” – Barbara Walters, former Host of ABC’s the View, 20/20, Evening News, and NBC’s the Today Show
Who is Jeffrey L. Diamond?
I’m an award-winning journalist with forty years of experience in television news and an aspiring novelist.  I began my career at ABC News where I produced for the weekly newsmagazine, 20/20, supervising hundreds of stories, ranging from several minutes in length to a full hour of programming.  My body of work includes newsmaker profiles, breaking news and investigative reports, major interviews, and numerous crime stories.  During my career, I collaborated with some of the biggest names in the business---including anchors Charles Gibson, Hugh Downs, Jane Pauley, Stone Phillips, and Barbara Walters, and correspondents Deborah Roberts, Tom Jarriel, Jim Avila, and Lynn Sherr.  
I also created Dateline NBC and served as an executive producer at Martha Stewart Living Television and Judith Regan Television, where I was responsible for overseeing multi-million dollar budgets, supervising hundreds of producers, writers, editors, and camera crews, and conceptualizing and implementing the creative content of these programs.  
Toward the end of my television career, I devoted all of my creative energies to producing stories, once again, for 20/20.  My responsibilities spanned every aspect of storytelling---from research, budgeting, interviewing, and directing to writing, editing, and post-production.  I’ve been nominated for dozens of awards and won six national Emmy Awards, two Dupont-Columbia Awards, one Peabody Award, one National Press Club Consumer Journalism Award, two CINE Golden Eagle Awards, and countless others.  I currently live in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts with my wife, Amy, and my golden retriever, Bailey, where I am hard at work on the next Ethan Benson thriller.The Team

Why Does Publishing Cost So Much Money?
Live to Air is being published by the best hybrid publishing company in the business---the Greenleaf Book Group.  The company is highly selective, evaluating close to 2500 manuscripts and publishing roughly 75 books a year.  Live to Air is one of those books.  I elected to go with Greenleaf and not to self-publish because of its stellar reputation, and because I knew I’d have access to some of the best people in the industry---a first-rate project manager, editor, proofreader, cover design artist, interior layout expert---as well as a team of e-book, print on demand, distribution, and marketing specialists.  But the cost is steep---well over $20,000---and I have to pay all of it upfront.
Here’s the breakdown in dollars ($)



And the above expenses don’t include my author website, this fundraising campaign, a book tour, and a public relations firm to help coordinate the promotion.  I’m willing to absorb these additional expenses out of my own pocket and have launched an Indiegogo Fundraising Campaign just to pay the cost of publishing Live to Air, because I believe in Ethan Benson and hope to establish his character in an ongoing series of murder mysteries for everyone to enjoy. 
The second thriller, Live to Tape, is already written, and the third book, Live to the Network, is currently in research. What are the Gifts for Pledges

</div></div>","Emotions Poetry Series  The gift of poetry may be one of life's most powerful—and envied—skills. A poem well told can make us laugh, weep, swell with pride, or rise with indignation.  Humans seem to be fundamentally hard-wired for emotional connection and the creation of beautiful poetry and prose has developed emotional reactions and contacts with us all since time began. The oral poetry tradition is as old as language itself.  Throughout history, poetry has primarily existed in the verbal realm, preserving and passing knowledge across generations before being canonized in print.  This was true of the ancient epics, and it’s true today. Romance, love, life and death, are all expressed through the powerful phrasing of rhythmic words, making poetry a life-changing medium for good. Emotions Poetry Series The emotions poetry series is a compilation of poetry works by Colinda Aldridge. Colinda has captured the lives of everyday people through her epic series of books, commenting on the twists and turns of life that bring about our most intimate emotional reactions.  About Colinda Aldridge               Colinda’s books cover all aspects of life from Love and happiness to new life and death, allowing individuals to connect with and express their own emotions through beautiful words and delivery. Colinda Aldridge is an up and coming author who has devoted her time to crafting authentic prose for the benefit of others. Colinda has always loved reading and writing and from a very early age was engaged in the heart warming activities of writing her very own prose, poetry and literature.  The passion that Colinda has for writing drives her to establish her own legacy in the world of literature. For Colinda coping with tragedy and conquering fears always begins and ends with the ink of the pen and the smooth surface of a sheet of paper.  Colinda is ready to share her work with the entire world, and is launching this Crowdfunding campaign to fund the release of her Emotions series alongside the release of her first CD of her work.  By supporting this campaign you will be helping Colinda to realise her dream and help others who will benefit from the beauty of Colinda’s talent with words. Why?Because telling your story - and sharing it with those that care - may be the most powerful medicine on earth. Each of us is a constantly unfolding story, a hero in a novel no one else can write, and still so many of us leave our stories untold.  When this happens we lose the narrative of life, the passing on of batons, the inspiration for life itself and the hope of a future generation. We all have a responsibility to take the time to share our stories, good, bad and otherwise. To educate and illuminate the minds of children, to spark their imagination, to heal our very own souls and connect with the lost and lonely.

<p>Problem: How to penetrate the many serious barriers blocking communications between the American People and their elected

cycle. It’s not just that there are eighteen (at last count) candidates running
for the Republican nomination. No, there is something else; you can feel it in
the political wind. There is a certain anger, a certain determination. It’s as
if the people are saying, this time we are going to get it right! This time we
are going to make a difference! This time we are not going to let them get away
with promising us one thing and delivering quite another.</span><br/></p>
<p>The Republican establishment is nervous.</p>
<p>It began with Donald Trump. No one foresaw the
success of his candidacy. Now they don’t know how to stop it. Now Ben Carson is
rising. Carly Fiorina is gaining strength. None of these people is
establishment, candidates.<b> The people are speaking.</b> <b>The
people want their voices heard!</b> They are throwing away everything to
do with the Republican Party. As Trump says, the people want to make America
great again, not cut backroom deals with corporations and special interests
that harm America’s future.</p>
<p>Enter eVoiceAmerica .com, a new website built to do just that—<b>provide
power to the people</b>, a new avenue to get YOUR opinion heard. The<b> average
voter</b> has long <b>complained that their elected representatives
promise to listen to them</b>, promise to uphold their views, you know, the
views that got them elected.</p>
<p>Then, they get to Washington and do something else
entirely over time. They do things like fund Obamacare, wilt in the face of
Obama’s illegal immigration actions, wilt in the face of an Iran deal that will
endanger your children’s future! Of course, there are exceptions, like Ted Cruz
and Mike Lee. But, on average, voters are distrustful of Washington and the
professional politicians that reside there, getting rich off of selling access
and power. The views of the little guy just get drowned out.</p>
<p>eVoiceAmerica.com wants to change all that. With eVoiceAmerica, you can make sure your voice is heard. And more than-than, you
can make sure your opinion counts! You can band together with other like-minded
conservatives—there is power in numbers! But what eVoiceAmerica wants to do is to hold politicians accountable!</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring your representative acts
in your interests, with eVoiceAmerica, you can learn
about issues. You can contribute your opinion on any concern to the general
discussion by adding resources. You can see how your politician has voted in
the past on bills that matter to you and your family.</p>
<p>But the best thing of all with eVoiceAmerica is that you can TAKE ACTION! You can do something about the
issue that bothers you. You know, that issue that keeps you up at night! You can
push that button and send your opinion to your Congressman right then and

<p><b>There are 18+ Republican candidates who

Republican establishment is perplexed. Currently two candidates account for 51
percent of the vote, and neither of them is a politician. Other non-politicians
are gaining, as are the non-establishment Republicans. I’d say the people are
speaking!</span></p>
<p>eVoiceAmerica.com is a new website built to do just that—<b>provide power to the people. </b>eVoiceAmerica.com

Heard?</b></p><p><b></b></p><p>In crafting this
deal as an executive agreement, President Obama bypassed the Constitution and
the Congressional duty to approve treaties.  Perhaps he knew this deal
would never get through Congress.  The Obama administration also withheld
key documents from the entire Congressional process and the public, making it
impossible to know exactly what was going on in the negotiations; i.e., what
the United States was signing up for.  I don’t think anyone really knows
what is in the deal completely, even today!  In any event, the next
president is going to have a huge mess on his hands.  </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">No
matter what poll you look at, public support for the Iran agreement has been
dropping like a rock.  One recent poll showed support for the deal at a
mere twenty-one percent.  So what we have here is a situation where the
President of the United States has directly bypassed the will of the American
people to spin his nefarious web of appeasing the real Islamic State’s mullahs.
 He bypassed the people’s elected representatives and went against the
will of the man on the street.  </span></p>
<p>So
this begs the question, how does the average American Joe-bag-of-donuts get his
opinion heard anymore?  How can the public get their opinion heard in
Washington BEFORE a deal like this gets too far down the approval process on
the road to becoming public policy?  How can we hold politicians accountable
for their actions?</p>
<p>Enter
stage right, eVoiceAmerica.com.  eVoiceAmerica is a new site that
allows individuals to ensure their opinion reaches their elected representatives.
 These opinions can be on a whole host of issues.  The great thing
about the process that eVoiceAmerica.com has set up is that you can take action
immediately, when you feel the urge!  The collective voices of middle
America will be transmitted to their representatives in regular reports.
 They won’t be able to ignore the will of the people any more!  Your
representative, and the voters, will know if he is doing the people’s bidding,
or his own.  Americans can hold their politicians accountable!
 What a concept! </p>
<p>Many
people are really angry about this Iran deal and the way it was handled.
 Now you can do something about it.  Please check out
EvoiceAmerica.com.  Sign up and let your voice be heard!</p>

their opinions to several DC reps at the same time.  Below is a sample list as it appears on the site. Problem solved. </p>

and UCLA); have traveled to the former U.S.S.R. and India respectively (as exchange students
on diplomatic passports)  as undergrads; are joint holders of three U.S.
patents; and are successful entrepreneurs based on one of those patents.  
Problem: How to penetrate the many serious barriers blocking communications between the American People and their elected
representatives in Washington. Applying our invention motto: “If you solve a
problem for yourself, you have most likely solved it for millions of others,” we set out to solve this problem. We knew that tens of millions shared this frustration and concern, so we created
eVoiceAmerica.com to solve this serious impediment to our representative democracy.                                        Now we are ready to fund and launch national and regional radio
ads; social media campaigns, and national television ads to inform Americans about
eVoiceAmerica.com to increase its impact and begin building an organization to support it with highly
qualified researchers, analysts, marketing staff, site programmers, and supervisory staff.
Site Status and
Purpose
     Status: eVoiceAmerica.com is a fully functioning, take-action, political destination site and is ready for prime time. The inventors have individually / personally funded all of the site programming, development, site security, marketing, and patent protection to date.       Purpose: We want to give our citizens a real voice
that will actually give the President and each member of Congress incentives,
reasons, and motivations to listen to Americans’ majority mandates on issues that affect them personally such as the Iran nuclear deal, the Keystone Pipeline; sanctuary cities; Syrian
resettlement in the US; immigration, climate change, religious freedom;  and many, many more. Now we need your crowdfunding contributions to systematically and methodically deconstruct the ruling, political class in DC, using the legitimate, time-honored, tools of our Democracy to do so through our patented, internet technology and in the numbers that the internet possible. It's time to turn the tables on DC. To optimally motivate our reps, eVoicAmerica provides a patented, historical FIRST: eVoiceAmerica's majority percentages are published on site and availabile to TO THE MEDIA as issue-based, Yes/No eVote majority percentages nationally and for all states and districts. These majorities are constituent-validated to create daily and real-time majority percentages and mandates as ""America's voice"". Congress will know that we know what it knows: majority percentages on specific issues. It's no longer a one-way email process into the Congressinal Black Hole, but a 360-degree cycle of Our Voice creating Congressional accountability and legistative results reflecting the American majority voice.                                        eVoiceAmerica.com has

MUST
SHARE!!! Power to The People! New eVoiceAmerica.com Website Holds Politicians
Accountable — AWESOME!  
There is something new in the air this election
cycle. It’s not just that there are eighteen (at last count) candidates running
for the Republican nomination. No, there is something else; you can feel it in
the political wind. There is a certain anger, a certain determination. It’s as
if the people are saying, this time we are going to get it right! This time we
are going to make a difference! This time we are not going to let them get away
with promising us one thing and delivering quite another.
The Republican establishment is nervous.
It began with Donald Trump. No one foresaw the
success of his candidacy. Now they don’t know how to stop it. Now Ben Carson is
rising. Carly Fiorina is gaining strength. None of these people is
establishment, candidates. The people are speaking. The
people want their voices heard! They are throwing away everything to
do with the Republican Party. As Trump says, the people want to make America
great again, not cut backroom deals with corporations and special interests
that harm America’s future.
Enter eVoiceAmerica .com, a new website built to do just that—provide
power to the people, a new avenue to get YOUR opinion heard. The average
voter has long complained that their elected representatives
promise to listen to them, promise to uphold their views, you know, the
views that got them elected.
Then, they get to Washington and do something else
entirely over time. They do things like fund Obamacare, wilt in the face of
Obama’s illegal immigration actions, wilt in the face of an Iran deal that will
endanger your children’s future! Of course, there are exceptions, like Ted Cruz

Politicians are not truthful. This is so true that legislation was
passed to protect them from lying. So the only way to hold them accountable is
to vote them out.
But what about when we are voting them
in?
There are 18+ Republican candidates who
want to be president. We need to find the RIGHT one! No more promises with no
chance of delivering.The
Republican establishment is perplexed. Currently two candidates account for 51
percent of the vote, and neither of them is a politician. Other non-politicians
are gaining, as are the non-establishment Republicans. I’d say the people are
speaking!
eVoiceAmerica.com is a new website built to do just that—provide power to the people. eVoiceAmerica.com
allows YOUR opinion to be heard.They publicly oppose
legislation that they privately allow to pass. Look at ObamaCare, the recent
TPPA deal, and finally the Iranian nuclear deal. This is why voters are
distrustful of Washington and the professional politicians that reside there,
getting rich off of selling access and power. The views of the little guy just
get drowned out.
eVoiceAmerica.com wants to change all

In
addition to ensuring your representative acts in your interests, eVoiceAmerica educates people
on the issues.  Further, you can contribute your opinion on any concern to
the general discussion by adding resources. And you can see how your politician
has voted in the past on bills that matter to you and your family.
Perhaps the
best thing of all with eVoiceAmerica is that you can TAKE ACTION!
If you have passion
for an issue, you can join thousands of others, and push a button and send
your opinion to your Congressman right then and there!
Think of the power you

Heard?In crafting this
deal as an executive agreement, President Obama bypassed the Constitution and
the Congressional duty to approve treaties.  Perhaps he knew this deal
would never get through Congress.  The Obama administration also withheld
key documents from the entire Congressional process and the public, making it
impossible to know exactly what was going on in the negotiations; i.e., what
the United States was signing up for.  I don’t think anyone really knows
what is in the deal completely, even today!  In any event, the next
president is going to have a huge mess on his hands.  No
matter what poll you look at, public support for the Iran agreement has been
dropping like a rock.  One recent poll showed support for the deal at a
mere twenty-one percent.  So what we have here is a situation where the
President of the United States has directly bypassed the will of the American
people to spin his nefarious web of appeasing the real Islamic State’s mullahs.
 He bypassed the people’s elected representatives and went against the
will of the man on the street.  
So
this begs the question, how does the average American Joe-bag-of-donuts get his
opinion heard anymore?  How can the public get their opinion heard in
Washington BEFORE a deal like this gets too far down the approval process on
the road to becoming public policy?  How can we hold politicians accountable
for their actions?
Enter
stage right, eVoiceAmerica.com.  eVoiceAmerica is a new site that
allows individuals to ensure their opinion reaches their elected representatives.
 These opinions can be on a whole host of issues.  The great thing
about the process that eVoiceAmerica.com has set up is that you can take action
immediately, when you feel the urge!  The collective voices of middle
America will be transmitted to their representatives in regular reports.
 They won’t be able to ignore the will of the people any more!  Your
representative, and the voters, will know if he is doing the people’s bidding,
or his own.  Americans can hold their politicians accountable!
 What a concept! 
Many
people are really angry about this Iran deal and the way it was handled.
 Now you can do something about it.  Please check out
EvoiceAmerica.com.  Sign up and let your voice be heard!
So give it try? Take Action Now?                                               # # # # # # # # # # # What is the difference between statistical polling and eVoiceAmerica’s majority percentages?OK, here’s what eVoiceAmerica’s percentages are not: they are not a dip-stick, snapshot, statistical polls of only 500-2000 people by phone at a single point in time.These types of polls are notoriously inconsistent and of limited value. eVoiceAmerica is, simply and powerfully, the American representative process made digital, daily, in real time, and over time as majority percentages. eVoiceAmerica takes the Town Hall from the local neighborhood to Washington DC with the kind of information a rep would acquire if he were to hold local town hall meetings.Polls are snapshots and serve their purpose. However,eVoiceAmerica majority percentage data is continuous, historical, authentic, deep and wide, and encompasses American majorities, and ,when it matures to tens of millions of users, is based on a huge volume of grassroots data. eVoiceAmerica's majority percentages on individual issues is preserved and published in one of its many subscription Daily Data Reports and can be accessed by Americans, Congress folk, all media, universities, think tanks, etc.With Your
Contributions, eVoiceAmerica.com and the American People Will Restore Congress's Ability to Represent Us. America’s Documented, Majority Mandates to Congress Will End Gridlock and
Impose Term Limits Without a Constitutional Amendment or Legislation.
These advertising and marketing efforts will motivate millions
of Americans to join millions of “eVoiceAmericans” to generate potentially
millions of opinions and eVotes to the President and Congress to create voting
mandates on all top issues to Congress every day. These will, in turn, create
national majorities on top issues important to Americans. eVoiceAmerica’s eVote
data also creates voting majority mandates on all top issues for each  member of Congress (in the
millions). eVoiceAmerica publishes this information  in numerous ways on site; to the media as
issue-based, majority percentage; and by daily and monthly subscription reports
(our revenue sources). Now Americans can know, for the first time in history,
what mandates we are giving to Washington. If they vote our majorities, they
will be re-elected; if not, they will be turned out – automatic term limits imposed by the voters. Gridlock ends because these 51% -70%+ majorities cross party, ethnicity, gender, economic and educational lines, so Congress can't vote party agendas, lobbyist influence,or self-interest without risking exposure by eVoiceAmerica and  defeat at the polls. Your donations create this measurable, lasting
impact on Congress and the President, putting Americans back in charge by
restoring our representative government. 

What eVoiceAmerica Needs 
Now that the site is fully functional and ready for prime time,
with key endorsements, we need to raise $535,000. This amount will fund and launch ongoing, national and regional radio ad campaigns, social media marketing, and television advertising campaigns to inform
Americans about eVoiceAmerica.com and expand its organization to support it
with highly qualified researchers, analysts, marketing staff, and site
programmers.

What
You Get: Our Perks
BecauseeVoiceAmerica is a take-action and political data-generating, data-gathering and data disemination site, we do not have a physical product to offer as a perk. 
Instead, 10% of your crowdfunding contribution will be
donated to your choice of:

1) 
Veterans' Home Building and Rehabilitation (example: Homes for Our
Troops). Builds handicapped-adapted homes for wounded veterans and their
families at no charge.  

2) 
Childrens' Medical Treatment and Research (examples: Shriners Hospital for Children, St. Jude’s
Children’s Hospital). Treatment is free to all
patients and their families.

3)  A Constitutional Defense Fund (examples:
Judicial Watch, American Center for Law & Justice, Landmark Legal
Foundation). These organizations fund,
file, and pursue lawsuits against the federal government for its unconstitutional
violations of individual citizen’s rights.4) Cancer Research & Treatment (examples: City of Hope, Huntsman Cancer Institute, and Mayo Clinic)  These organizations are accredited by that National Cancer Institute and provide genetic and other research to develop cures for cancer 

Now you can support
restoring America and make a philanthropic donation to the causes of your
choice at the same time. Please join us in doing both.
When our contributors see the vision of eVoiceAmerica.com and their
generous donations exceed our goal, eVoiceAmerica will dedicate these funds to
expanding the same impact of the federal site to the states, cities, and
communities and the significant programming and research which that will
require. With the extra / added funding, eVoiceAmerica can make these new services available far more
quickly. eVoiceAmerica hopes to develop a data-mining service for the research
into what Americans majority values and mandates are in all civic communities
to give our elected leaders the input they need to implement the mind, will, and
values of the People.
The Impact
Let’s peel the eVoiceAmerica.com ""onion,"" shall we?
Layer 1: Easy eVote and Opinion Delivery to DC. As ordinary Americans, we realized that there was no way for
Americans to easily communicate their opinions to their elected reps; to store
this rep contact information for all of their DC reps in one place, provide this list for each login, and to deliver
their opinions to several DC reps at the same time.  Below is a sample list as it appears on the site. Problem solved. 

Layer 2: How Majority Mandates Are Created. We also realized the need to capture this historic data to
anonymously document the issue-based, eVote-supported, AND
constituent-validated data that create daily and real-time majority mandates:
national, state, and district for each Senator and House member. eVoiceAmerica has accomplished “all of the above.” These solutions create accountability by the
American people and the media because, with this data, we can know which
members of Congress are voting with and are honoring their constituents’
majorities. The screen below show where Americans enter their eVotes and personal opinions.
eVoiceAmerica captures aggregates, and delivers this information to Congress, the President, the media and to our users on site on a daily basis. Problem
Solved.

Layer 3: How Your eVotes and Opinions Are Delivered. Upon submitting each opinion, users are again provided with their personalized
list of elected reps with check boxes
for each user to select with rep are to receive that opinion.Layer 4: How Voters Impose Term Limits. This new, pioneering, history-making, published,
majority/values data enables Americans AND the media to know which reps deserve
re-election and which do not and should be booted out (“de-elected”) for
failing to represent their constituent majorities. IMPACT: This automatically
accomplishes de facto term limits
(without a constitutional amendment - which Congress will NEVER pass - so we can do it without them).Layer 5: Why eVoiceAmerica is Not a Poll. eVoiceAmerica also enables Americans to create majority
mandates that reflect their values.  The
“polling class” shows majority percentages on many top issues in the low 50s to
high 60s, even 70+. These high percentages cross party, gender, ethnic, economic,
educational lines and reflect the values and direction our country should be
going.  So, there is powerful common ground among the
American people, just not in Congress. IMPACT: Using eVoiceAmerica.com, these
high, statistical-sample polls (sample shown below) can be converted to authentic opinions and eVote
majority percentages which can then be converted to votes in Congress when
legislation comes up --  and sometimes
into veto-proof congressional votes to limit Presidential overreach.

Layer 6:  How eVoiceAmerica Data Is Conveyed Directly to Congress Each Day (Method 1). This new data is
conveyed to Congress in two ways: 1) eVoiceAmerica provides a free, daily
report to each member of Congress containing, by issue, information sufficient
to validate constituency, the opinion, and Yes/No eVote percentages on each
issue for all constituents. IMPACT: This report gives them their “marching
orders” on current and future legislation. Below is a sample of this daily report to Congress.

How eVoiceAmerica Data Is Conveyed Directly to Congress Each Day (Method 2) and Ends Congressional Gridlock. Now let’s multiply this times 535 (all members of Congress)
when  eVoiceAmerica provides its “Federal
Congressional Coalition Builder Report” to all members of Congress. This report will permit all members of
Congress to see the constituent report described above for all 535 of their
congressional colleagues. Now, for the first time in history, 1) members can
see constituent majorities on every issue for all members of Congress, whether
Democrat or Republican, to form bipartisan coalitions in advance of a vote. 2)
They can also see when members have 50/50 constituent percentages on a given
issue and attempt to persuade them to vote with them, increasing the chance for
a majority or even a veto-proof, super majority. 3) They can also “watch dog”
members to prevent them from voting against their constituent majorities.
IMPACT: No more gridlock caused by partisanship, backdoor deals, lobbying
influence, self-serving votes, etc. With this new eVoiceAmerica information in
the hands of all members of Congress, the People, and the media, now government
gridlock can be unlocked because Congress realizes that they can’t ignore their
constituents any longer. Americans are back in charge.

Layer 7: You Can Answer the Question Daily: ""Would You Re-Elect Me Today?"" regarding your reps. The political class in Congress are always concerned about
being re-elected and spend countless tax dollars trying to insure their
re-election. Let’s take the guess work out of it for them. The first time each
day  eVoiceAmericans log in, they can
answer the question, “Would You Re-Elect Me Today?” for all those on their
recurring elected rep list. “Rep” is in quotes because it should read “elected
politicians list,” because they only represent themselves most of the time.
eVoiceAmerica tallies these yes/no votes into a daily reading / report on where
they stand with their constituents. If they are truly representing their
constituents, they will get majority “yes” votes and if not, the “no” votes
will “de-elect” them in the next election. IMPACT: Now we can keep the pressure
on Congress between elections, as
James Madison advocated and foresaw, using daily, public opinion pressure to
keep them on track. Madison would have been thrilled with eVoiceAmerica.com.
Yet an another “eVoiceAmerican” way to impose term limits by us, the
“outsiders.” Tables turned. Problem solved.In the screen below, the user votes yes or no once a day if they would re-elect their reps today.

In the screen above, the user can see the yes/no percentages for the previous day. Our elected reps receive this information daily in their free ""Daily Constituent Percentage Report."" 

Layer 8: How You Can Educate Yourselves on the Issues Using Our Information Portal. This is a convenient way for Americans to
access articles, books, and videos by issue, using eVoiceAmerica’s Info Portal
to help educate themselves on issues and formulate educated opinions and
eVotes.

Layer 9: 2016 Presidential Campaign Feature: This offers Americans a Daily
2016 Presidential ballot box where they can not only vote for or against candidates
but they can also can also provide input to them as to why they support them or
oppose them. eVoiceAmerica provides this data to the candidate and provides a
real-time support percentages on site at the conclusion of the process. Only one “Support”
vote keeps the ""ballot stuffers"" at bay.


Layer 10: You Can See Issue-Based Comments of the eVoiceAmerica Community. All users’ comments are sited within the issue upon which they
opined to create a community that openly shares their ideas. The users’ actual
names are not attached to these comments.

Monitization
eVoice shares much of its data with users for free on the site,
including 1) recurring rep lists; 2) Would You Re-Elect Me?  constituent
percentages for the previous day; 3) real-time and previous-day percentage on
the issues; and 4) background articles on the issues in the Information Portal.
eVoiceAmerica also emails a free daily constituent reports to all members of Congress to fulfill our site commitment to provide daily, issue-based, majority
percentages to Congress. This is the ONLY report in which the user’s
name is mentioned so reps can verify constituency and acknowledge their receipt of
your opinions. All other reports are based on aggregated, anonymous data with
no reference to individuals. 

Revenue streams: eVoiceAmerica also generates subscription
reports for various combinations of its data which is how the site is
monetized, including 1) Top Issues Daily Percentage report to eVoiceAmerica
users (currently programmed); 2) Federal Coalition Builder Report (programming
in progress); 3) Re-Elect Me? reports to all members of Congress so all of them will
know their standing with their constituents on a daily basis; 4) 2016 Presidential Campaign
daily reports; and 5) other comprehensive data reports. All of these reports
will be available when the data reaches a meaningful threshold. 
Risks & Challenges
1) The potential for copycat
sites; 2) malicious DDoS attacks intended to disrupt our site services by those
threatened by eVoiceAmerica’s IMPACTs described above; 3) shutdown by
onslaughts of massive, automated, non-human traffic (bots); 4) shutdown due to
spikes in user traffic based on advertising; media, organizational, and
pundit/commentator endorsements; and their issue-based, mobilization efforts;
and 5) out-dated elected rep lists. eVoice has implemented solutions to all of the above threats as described below.
eVoiceAmerica.com has
contracted with experts to prevent and neutralize all of  the above threats. Re #1,eVoiceAmerica has obtained a utility patent on its site and
database programming and its data-gathering and data-dissemination programming
(Patent No. 8,135,693). Re #2, eVoiceAmerica has contracted with Neustar for its
DDoS protection services which scrub malicious traffic and return only clean
traffic to the site with no disruption of service to our users. Re #3,
eVoiceAmerica has retained Distil Networks to eliminate all automated,
non-human traffic that would slow down or shutdown service.  Re #4, eVoiceAmerica has contracted with
Varosis to provide auto-scaling to immediately accommodate traffic spikes and
to load balance incoming traffic to prevent site crashes or slowdowns. Re #5,
eVoiceAmerica receives updates from Zip Info who provides regular updates on
the Congressional Districts Database and the Zip+4 database insure new registrants receive accurate elected reps lists. We also offer on-site
access to the USPS.com zip-code finder for addresses added subsequent to the
official Zip+4 updates to generate accurate elected rep matches to our users.

It will also help us to pay the travel allowance and fees of our guest master illustrator.This book will not only be an eye candy, but also a close look at the craftsmanship and behind the scenes of editorial illustration: images that recreate stories, translate concepts and reinterpret familiar faces in original portraits, will go together with the illustrators profiles and critical excerpts on their style and workflow, from both the authors and the editors who help them achieve a harmonic bond between images and text.Illustración Malpensante 20 años will be a window to the recent history of editorial illustration in Colombia and the rest of the world; a close look to this job; a reference guide for everybody involved and a collection of some the most striking and moving pieces for those who, like us, love this craft.Help us make it possible! Be part of this project and get your book now.Please, do share this campaign through your social networks and spread the word!Thanks for your support!© Juan Gaviriahttp://www.elmalpensante.com/",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Author is former political refugee from
the poor small nation of Nicaragua, forced out his land as a young man by a
revolution that claimed tens of thousands of lives in 1979. He arrived in
California escaping the war and became a part of another revolution, --the
technology revolution in the Silicon Valley-- where he strived to become a
wealthy man and someday go back to his homeland to help the poor in the small town
where he was born.  Although he did enjoy
some financial success, he was never able to achieve his lofty goals, despite
having worked for over ten startup companies in the Silicon Valley in search of
his elusive dream and eventually, gave up on his noble dream and settled for a
standard upper middle class life where he currently resides with his wife and
kids.</p>

his life upside down and his once desire to make tons of money, vanishes!  And as a result of that conversion back to

Currently there is no message more profound than the message of climate change and the need to change our values and practices. One of the central values and practices that we Americans need to change is consumption, and there is no holiday more dedicated to consumption than Christmas. Therefore, there is no person better suited to teach us new values and practices than Santa. <br/></p><p></p><p>After Christmas last year when I read that 2014 had been the hottest on record, (and now 2015 has exceeded it) I felt a deep desire to find a new way to reach people about the importance of changing our values and our consumer driven habits. This is the goal of this story -to invite adults and children to go on a magical journey of self and social discovery that returns us to the true meaning of giving.</p><p><b><i>A North Pole Tale</i></b> has been written and revised numerous times and is in a final draft. However, what it now needs to make it come fully alive are illustrations like the ones shown here. Done by Fei Fei, a former UCONN student of mine, now an illustrator working in China, (where she is originally from) Fei Fei has the skills and vision to make this book truly beautiful.  Yet to do so, requires a fair amount of time and I would like to honor her work by compensating her.  Additionally, once it is illustrated, we need to have funds to self-publish it to make sure people will be able to read and learn from its wisdom.  This is where <b>YOU </b>come in.  </p><p>But first let me share some of the story with you....</p><p></p><p><i><b>It
was the day after Christmas and as he did every year a very tired Santa took a
well deserved rest. This year he felt more tired than usual as he had delivered
more toys than ever. ""What was Christmas coming to?"" he wondered, as
it seemed to him to be more and more about 'getting things' and less and less
about 'giving love' but he didn't know what he could do to change this,
especially not today. For today was they day that he liked to do nothing but
sit by his fire with his cat Kringle and finish all the cookies he had collected from
children around the world while reading the paper. Feeling very relaxed
and comfortable Santa was about to take a long winter’s nap when he saw a small
article at the back of his paper The North Pole News that jolted him fully
awake.  The headline read:</b></i></p>
<p><i><b>  “ Scientists Confirm : 2014 Hottest Year in
Recorded Human History.” </b></i></p><p>Once Santa connects the dots about climate change, remembering that his boots and even his sled were sinking in the permafrost, he realizes the one person with whom he must speak.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450753947/cwr64zgnpsqyjjjxfruq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><i><b>Now
Santa had a secret that no one else alive but himself and the scientist he was
going to see knew.  It was not a secret
they had chosen not to disclose but that was just how it had happened, the way
when you mean to say something but before you know it the moment has passed and
it just remains unsaid.  This secret was
that Santa had a half brother who like himself celebrated Christmas but whose
mother was a member of the people called Inuit. Along with Santa and his elves the Inuit live in the North Pole, as
well as in  Northern Canada and Alaska. Santa was much
older than his brother and although they hadn’t spent much time together they
had a deep connection that couldn’t be put into words.  In fact, this connection was a mystery to
them both as the saw the world so differently 
based on the different cultures in which they were raised.  It was this difference in perspective that Santa was hoping could
now help him answer his question.  He had
not seen his brother in some time but if anyone might have an insight he knew Akycha (that means Sun god)
would, as he was a very smart man.</b></i></p>Giving Santa an Inuit half-brother opens the story to other ideas  such as Santa learning  lessons from his dreams <div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450754037/ikmogwoghixxq1rgiz4p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div><br/></div><div>and from going on a shamanic journey with a group of animals, including a Polar Bear.   <p></p>
<p><i><b>Santa may have traveled the globe but he had never met a polar bear and certainly had
never been inside a cave with one.  So he
was a little taken aback when he realized this bear could speak or at least if
she wasn’t actually speaking he could still hear her words in his head.  “You’ve been waiting for me?”  Santa replied with confusion.  “Yes,” 
she said “who else better to learn the wisdom I have to share than
you?”  “I don’t know”  said Santa. “Until a few days ago my only
role was to make and bring presents to the children of the world.  And then since learning about climate change
everything has been getting very mysterious!” </b></i></p>
<p><i><b> “Its only mysterious Santa because even though every year you fly above the
earth you have yet to see the global picture. 
You have only been seeing the parts. 
Are you willing to see the whole?” 
“I suppose so” said Santa pulling on his long white beard.  “Will you show me how?”  he inquired wondering if he’d be able to sit
down as he was feeling a bit tired. 
“Have a seat Santa”  she said
motioning to  a comfortable looking rock
.  “And here have some special hot
mushroom tea.  You must be tired and
thirsty from your long journey”  she
added while handing him a large mug of warm liquid.  “Mushroom tea” thought Santa “how unpleasant”
but he didn’t want to be rude so he took a sip. 
The warm liquid was earthy tasting but pleasant and he could feel it
helping him to relax.</b></i></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450753916/pulyrvfqcu4lsqswgv01.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>Santa goes on a shamanic journey and when he comes to he realizes what he must do. .  However, most of the details don't come to him until he meets his half-brother's daughter - his niece, on his way back to his home.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>“Santa”  she
called out waving with one hand and holding her reigns with the other as she
steered her sleigh to stop next to Santa.. “Its me Yakone”.  “Yakone.. may how you’ve grown. 
What are you doing here all alone? “ 
asked Santa expressing his happiness to see her, as well as his
confusion as to why she might have come. 
“Atata (father) thought you might need someone to talk to- someone who is
a kid…so he asked me to pay you a visit before you got home, as I know kids
aren’t allowed to get too close”.  “Well,
that’s true” said Santa “...but you’re not just any kid.  Do you want to follow me home?”  </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>  “I would but Atata asked me to get home before dark so I can only stay a little while.  How was your visit with Nanuk?”  Yakone asked.  </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>  “It very strange Yakone …I have learned so
much about climate change that I now realize I know so little about myself”
Santa explained.  “In fact, I have been
left with a question I can’t answer- maybe you can help me?”  </b></i></p>
<p><i>  <b>“What is it” Yakone asked her brown eyes looking bigger than usual.  “The question is how can I be Santa if I
don’t make any toys, since toys take resources and the use of resources takes
homes away from animals and contributes to climate change”  Santa explained.</b></i><b> </b></p>
<p>And so together they come up with an answer but the final full answer doesn't come until the end of the book.  And for that you will have to wait until the book is ready....</p>
<p>So what this book needs is for these sketches and more to become full color illustrations <span style=""background-color: initial;"">to bring it to life.</span></p>
<p>As with Santa's realization in the story that its not the <b>gifts </b>the children want so much but the <i>connection with other people and beings</i>, I too want to recognize that its not just the gifts you are giving that matters, but the connection to all of you which matters most of all. Whatever you can give we appreciate  as we know it comes from your hearts and from your desire to change our social story from 'planetary consumption' to 'community creation'.</p>

<p>Fei Fei, as mentioned, is willing and able to do the illustrations but as a young artist newly graduated from UCONN, she needs to be paid for her time.  I do not have the funds to pay her and so we thought we'd create this campaign to ask others like you to help support us.  We are committed to illustrating this book and self-publishing it--all of which needs to be funded.  We want Santa to become a climate change hero and for his connections to, and help from, the Inuit culture and their values to be known. <br/></p>
<p>This chart is an approximation of what it will cost us to make <i><b>A North Pole Tale</b></i> a reality. This would be a lot for just the two of us but if we all pitch in it can be very little  and yet accomplish much!</p>

<br/>
<p>Depending on your level of support, you can get images from the book and even a signed copy or copies once we self-publish it.  You can see yourself as a patron of the arts and as a pioneer for addressing climate change.  Maybe you too have thought that the consumerism around Christmas needs to change and children need to get more of what really matters like time with family, nature and animals.  If so, then this would be a book you would enjoy reading and/or enjoy reading to/with your kids.  The news of climate change is hard to address with children but this book does so in a way that is heart and humor filled, while still presenting aspects of the truth. </p>

</div></div>","My Story and A North Pole TaleI am Phoebe Godfrey, a sociologist who teaches courses at UCONN on Society and Climate Change, Sustainable Societies, Sociology of Food and Race/ Class and Gender.  I often use children's books in my classes as they can be very powerful ways of conveying, in simple terms,  highly profound messages. Currently there is no message more profound than the message of climate change and the need to change our values and practices. One of the central values and practices that we Americans need to change is consumption, and there is no holiday more dedicated to consumption than Christmas. Therefore, there is no person better suited to teach us new values and practices than Santa. After Christmas last year when I read that 2014 had been the hottest on record, (and now 2015 has exceeded it) I felt a deep desire to find a new way to reach people about the importance of changing our values and our consumer driven habits. This is the goal of this story -to invite adults and children to go on a magical journey of self and social discovery that returns us to the true meaning of giving.A North Pole Tale has been written and revised numerous times and is in a final draft. However, what it now needs to make it come fully alive are illustrations like the ones shown here. Done by Fei Fei, a former UCONN student of mine, now an illustrator working in China, (where she is originally from) Fei Fei has the skills and vision to make this book truly beautiful.  Yet to do so, requires a fair amount of time and I would like to honor her work by compensating her.  Additionally, once it is illustrated, we need to have funds to self-publish it to make sure people will be able to read and learn from its wisdom.  This is where YOU come in.  But first let me share some of the story with you....It
was the day after Christmas and as he did every year a very tired Santa took a
well deserved rest. This year he felt more tired than usual as he had delivered
more toys than ever. ""What was Christmas coming to?"" he wondered, as
it seemed to him to be more and more about 'getting things' and less and less
about 'giving love' but he didn't know what he could do to change this,
especially not today. For today was they day that he liked to do nothing but
sit by his fire with his cat Kringle and finish all the cookies he had collected from
children around the world while reading the paper. Feeling very relaxed
and comfortable Santa was about to take a long winter’s nap when he saw a small
article at the back of his paper The North Pole News that jolted him fully
awake.  The headline read:
  “ Scientists Confirm : 2014 Hottest Year in
Recorded Human History.” Once Santa connects the dots about climate change, remembering that his boots and even his sled were sinking in the permafrost, he realizes the one person with whom he must speak.Now
Santa had a secret that no one else alive but himself and the scientist he was
going to see knew.  It was not a secret
they had chosen not to disclose but that was just how it had happened, the way
when you mean to say something but before you know it the moment has passed and
it just remains unsaid.  This secret was
that Santa had a half brother who like himself celebrated Christmas but whose
mother was a member of the people called Inuit. Along with Santa and his elves the Inuit live in the North Pole, as
well as in  Northern Canada and Alaska. Santa was much
older than his brother and although they hadn’t spent much time together they
had a deep connection that couldn’t be put into words.  In fact, this connection was a mystery to
them both as the saw the world so differently 
based on the different cultures in which they were raised.  It was this difference in perspective that Santa was hoping could
now help him answer his question.  He had
not seen his brother in some time but if anyone might have an insight he knew Akycha (that means Sun god)
would, as he was a very smart man.Giving Santa an Inuit half-brother opens the story to other ideas  such as Santa learning  lessons from his dreams and from going on a shamanic journey with a group of animals, including a Polar Bear.   
Santa may have traveled the globe but he had never met a polar bear and certainly had
never been inside a cave with one.  So he
was a little taken aback when he realized this bear could speak or at least if
she wasn’t actually speaking he could still hear her words in his head.  “You’ve been waiting for me?”  Santa replied with confusion.  “Yes,” 
she said “who else better to learn the wisdom I have to share than
you?”  “I don’t know”  said Santa. “Until a few days ago my only
role was to make and bring presents to the children of the world.  And then since learning about climate change
everything has been getting very mysterious!” 
 “Its only mysterious Santa because even though every year you fly above the
earth you have yet to see the global picture. 
You have only been seeing the parts. 
Are you willing to see the whole?” 
“I suppose so” said Santa pulling on his long white beard.  “Will you show me how?”  he inquired wondering if he’d be able to sit
down as he was feeling a bit tired. 
“Have a seat Santa”  she said
motioning to  a comfortable looking rock
.  “And here have some special hot
mushroom tea.  You must be tired and
thirsty from your long journey”  she
added while handing him a large mug of warm liquid.  “Mushroom tea” thought Santa “how unpleasant”
but he didn’t want to be rude so he took a sip. 
The warm liquid was earthy tasting but pleasant and he could feel it
helping him to relax.


Santa goes on a shamanic journey and when he comes to he realizes what he must do. .  However, most of the details don't come to him until he meets his half-brother's daughter - his niece, on his way back to his home.

“Santa”  she
called out waving with one hand and holding her reigns with the other as she
steered her sleigh to stop next to Santa.. “Its me Yakone”.  “Yakone.. may how you’ve grown. 
What are you doing here all alone? “ 
asked Santa expressing his happiness to see her, as well as his
confusion as to why she might have come. 
“Atata (father) thought you might need someone to talk to- someone who is
a kid…so he asked me to pay you a visit before you got home, as I know kids
aren’t allowed to get too close”.  “Well,
that’s true” said Santa “...but you’re not just any kid.  Do you want to follow me home?”  
  “I would but Atata asked me to get home before dark so I can only stay a little while.  How was your visit with Nanuk?”  Yakone asked.  
  “It very strange Yakone …I have learned so
much about climate change that I now realize I know so little about myself”
Santa explained.  “In fact, I have been
left with a question I can’t answer- maybe you can help me?”  
  “What is it” Yakone asked her brown eyes looking bigger than usual.  “The question is how can I be Santa if I
don’t make any toys, since toys take resources and the use of resources takes
homes away from animals and contributes to climate change”  Santa explained. 
And so together they come up with an answer but the final full answer doesn't come until the end of the book.  And for that you will have to wait until the book is ready....
So what this book needs is for these sketches and more to become full color illustrations to bring it to life.
As with Santa's realization in the story that its not the gifts the children want so much but the connection with other people and beings, I too want to recognize that its not just the gifts you are giving that matters, but the connection to all of you which matters most of all. Whatever you can give we appreciate  as we know it comes from your hearts and from your desire to change our social story from 'planetary consumption' to 'community creation'.
What I Need & What You Get
Fei Fei, as mentioned, is willing and able to do the illustrations but as a young artist newly graduated from UCONN, she needs to be paid for her time.  I do not have the funds to pay her and so we thought we'd create this campaign to ask others like you to help support us.  We are committed to illustrating this book and self-publishing it--all of which needs to be funded.  We want Santa to become a climate change hero and for his connections to, and help from, the Inuit culture and their values to be known. 
This chart is an approximation of what it will cost us to make A North Pole Tale a reality. This would be a lot for just the two of us but if we all pitch in it can be very little  and yet accomplish much!



Depending on your level of support, you can get images from the book and even a signed copy or copies once we self-publish it.  You can see yourself as a patron of the arts and as a pioneer for addressing climate change.  Maybe you too have thought that the consumerism around Christmas needs to change and children need to get more of what really matters like time with family, nature and animals.  If so, then this would be a book you would enjoy reading and/or enjoy reading to/with your kids.  The news of climate change is hard to address with children but this book does so in a way that is heart and humor filled, while still presenting aspects of the truth. 






Risks & Challenges

The risks are minimal as the story is written and as you can see Fei Fei has been hard at work creating the images and doing research to make sure she gets all the meaningful details. Once all the images are done we will self-publish the book so it can be sold on Amazon and from our website (not yet built). We don't want to waste time looking for a publisher as the polar ice caps are melting and we want to get our story out there in time for next Christmas! All we need is the financial support from you and/or for you to spread the word. 
The Impact
This year, 2015, will be the new hottest year on record.  The ice caps are melting faster than predicted and the permafrost in the Arctic is also melting.  Animals are going extinct and the forests of the world are being cut down at alarming rates. We need a radical shift in our values in terms of teaching our children that there many more important things in the world than 'things'.  A North Pole Tale  invites adults and children to explore how to be part of changing our culture story by first reading, then  sharing and ultimately putting into practice this heartwarming and magical Christmas climate change story.

</div>Hi,<br/><br/>I have just started writing a book. Now on page 47.<br/>I have changed the title two times, and am about to change it again to INCOMPLETE.<br/><br/>My pseudonym is John Smith. The book started as<br/>some random statements, but is now starting to go somewhere.<br/><br/>My funding request primarily serves the purpose of my<br/>physical survival, but is also a test to see if there is a <br/>chance I actually will get published.<br/><br/>If you like me to write more, and change the title to <br/>COMPLETE, choose an upvote perk.<br/><br/>If you hate it, choose a downvote perk.<br/><br/>If you want to be heard, there is a perk for that too.<br/><br/>Goes without saying that every contributor will receive a signed copy<br/>when my book gets published.<br/><br/>So without further ado here are the first 47 pages:<br/>------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.<br/><br/>MINDGAMES<br/><br/>If a mosquito transporting hemoragic dengue fever stings me, but I kill it slapping <br/>him right after the sting, who has won, if anybody?<br/><br/>First of all, to be able to decide on 'winning', 'losing' or a 'draw', there must be<br/>a game with criteria or rules, and players. The players must also be aware of the rules<br/>before playing. And we need a referee, to interpret the 'facts' to declare a result.<br/><br/>Secondly we need an audience, preferrably partial, to create the illusion that this<br/>game has any meaning. <br/><br/>Thirdly we need a beginning and an end. Without a beginning we would not know when the rules<br/>are in effect. Without an end we would not come to a result.<br/><br/>In my mosquito example, all of the above is missing, which would logically lead to a<br/>statement like 'life is not a game' or 'life has no meaning'.<br/>When I lay there bleeding out from the dengue fever however, I have a strong sense that the<br/>mosquito has won.<br/><br/>So why is that? Why do I have this feeling that there was a game going on, of which I and the mosquito <br/>knew the rules al along, and the mosquito just outsmarted me.<br/>And even with him dying in the process he still won.<br/><br/>Could it be that I felt superior to the mosquito, because I assumed that I was smarter?<br/>And if so, why did I assume I was smarter?<br/><br/>In a note to the reader I warn you that this lecture has no meaning at all, that it does not have<br/>a beginning, neither an end, that it will not give you any answers and will give you a lot of answers at the same time,<br/>that it will make you a either a zelot, an anarchist or yourself.<br/><br/>Back to my feeling of defeat. <br/>I feel defeat in a game. So what were the rules?<br/><br/>He was allowed to sting me for food - my blood - since I have a ton of it<br/>compared to his needs, but he was not allowed to infect me with deadly dengue fever.<br/>Or was he?<br/>If he was, that could mean a rule of this game is 'you die, you lose'.<br/>Then it would be a draw, since we both are dead.<br/><br/>Since I don't feel it is a draw, it must be that he was not allowed to infect me.<br/><br/>He broke the rule, so let's go to the referee. The referee states that I have won, according <br/>to the rules 'whoever breaks the rules loses' and 'the game ends when we have a winner'.<br/><br/>No didn't help. I still feel like a loser, and I feel betrayed. I need to go to a higher authority.<br/>The guilty must be punished. But the mosquito is already declared 'loser' by the referree. Furthermore he is dead.<br/>Nothing left to punish.<br/><br/>The result appears to have no meaning. Does that mean there was no game to begin with?<br/>Or does it mean that the rules have no bearing on and connection with reality? <br/>Again, the definition of a game.<br/><br/>Oh, I get it now. It must be that I want it to be a game, so I can start over.<br/><br/>Sounds familiar, doesn't it.<br/>Comforting even.<br/><br/>Why does this happen to me? Who did this to me? Who is to blame for me losing the game?<br/><br/>Yep, I feel it coming. Wild anger and rage.<br/>After ten seconds (my father tought me to count to ten whenever my emotions threaten to get me<br/>breaking the rules), my rationalization kicks in: 'I screwed up. I did't kill off al the dengue mosquitos<br/>in a pre-emptive strike'. 'The mosquito can't help it that he is carrying the dengue fever. He didn't even know it'<br/><br/>Noo. Superiority again. Can you prove the mosquito has no knowledge of dengue fever? For all you know they<br/>are best friends, teaming up to kill off this human in a pre-emptive strike.<br/><br/>Yeah, sure. Smart mosquito's and smart viusses, conspiring together to nail you. Little paranoia, don't you think?<br/>Well, it wouldn't be paranoid if it were true.<br/><br/>OK. Let's explore it. Dengue mosquito's find small pools of water everywhere to procreate. How do they do that? Can they<br/>smell water? And if so, is that a sign of intelligence? <br/>At least one meaning of the word intelligence certainly covers it.<br/>Being able to find weapons of mass destruction in some desert or on some island is considered to be intelligent. So much even<br/>that there is an Agency for it in existance.<br/><br/>I'll run with that. I state that dengue mosquito's are intelligent, and therefore have the capability to team up with<br/>the dengue fever virus to launch a pre-emptive strike against humans, their main enemy. <br/><br/>What about the dengue virus. Is that intelligent? Could it even be calling the shots?<br/>Why does it even exist? Is it aware there is a game going on, and does it play by it's rules?<br/><br/>That word again. 'Why'.  So difficult to answer. Much more difficult than 'Where', 'How', 'When', 'What'.<br/>Seems that the latter four are a result of the first one. Moreeven, the latter four seem not to<br/>exist without the first one. And they are of different cardinality. For one 'Why' can exist<br/>multiple 'How`s', for one 'How' can exist multiple 'Where`s' , for one 'Where' can exist multiple<br/>'When`s' and 'What`s'<br/><br/>No, wait a minute. For one Where-How-When-What combo could also exist multiple 'Why`s'.<br/>More causes to one effect? More effects to one cause? More instances attributing to one effect?<br/><br/>That last one is pretty mind-boggling. If it were truly possible, it would mean that time and place and even method<br/>have no role in the cause-effect theory. <br/>It would just be bouncing back and forth between 'Why`s' and 'What`s'. <br/>Each bounce both cause and effect switching it's label.<br/><br/>Gives me two new questions.<br/>The everlasting who-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg question.<br/>And a MetaWhy. Together with a MetaWhat.<br/><br/>Stop. This has no end. Like the endless reflections in two opposed mirrors.<br/><br/>Again. From the ground up.<br/><br/>I did not die yet. But surely it can't be much longer. Blood pooring out of<br/>my leaking skin. Could I still win? How? <br/><br/>The referree stated that the mosquito is the loser, because he broke a rule, and<br/>declared me a winner. What rule did the mosquito break?<br/><br/>The mosquito brought a hidden extra player to the game. <br/>Neither the referree nor me where informed about this extra player. <br/><br/>I still feel like crap though; like a loser.<br/>So I must have broken a rule too, and the referree must have missed that.<br/><br/>Yep, got it. I did not trust the mosquito that he was only going to<br/>take a little of my blood, which I could easily miss. For if I did trust on that<br/>I would not have killed him. I would just have sent him on his way with a soft sweep.<br/>The way a horse uses his tail.<br/><br/>All sorts of conclusions start showing up.<br/><br/>The main rule of this game is not 'You die, you lose', but 'You live, you win'<br/>I want to live, but I don't know why.<br/>I am alive, but I don't know why.<br/>The mosquito is dead, an he lost his game.<br/>The mosquito is dead, but still is a player in my game.<br/>I lost the game too, because I broke a rule too.<br/>The game is still going on with no players.<br/><br/>Sort of proves the bouncing I was talking about earlier. The mosquito is still dead,<br/>but he is an active player in my game. I already lost because I broke a rule, but the game is still going on,<br/>because I am not dead yet, and I am therefore a continuous winner?<br/><br/>I am going in circles here.<br/><br/>If it is a game, with a beginning and an end, with a winner and a loser, it cannot have<br/>as it's main rule 'You live, you win'. <br/>Since I surely feel that that is the main rule, it cannot be a game.<br/>And if it is, I am not playing. I would have no chance to win.<br/><br/>Sure miss God.<br/><br/><br/><br/>STICKING AROUND FOR NERDS<br/><br/>Hi players. Most of you did not survive the first round. And yes, that was intentional.<br/>If we are going to have mind games and resolve the unifying theory, we don't need<br/>trolls nor morons to cramp our style.<br/><br/>If you are going to read on, I demand your complete attention and devotion to stand up <br/>for what you believe is right.<br/>Kinda like Bill Gates does. 'You want to use my software, your arse belongs to me'.<br/><br/>So shout at this story, tell me I am wrong, but most of all WHY.<br/>At the end you will be either a zelot, an anarchist or yourself.<br/>It is my game so I start with the results, and we will work back from there.<br/><br/><br/>So you are a zelot. <br/>You continue believing that the earth is flat, because it is, because God said so.<br/>You are shorttracking the 'Why' here. And you are right of course. It must have started somewhere.<br/>At the firstever 'Why'. <br/><br/>The big bang you say. Didn't know God was so loud.<br/>Yes, you too Einstein (Just a nickname for you nerd; The real deal knew he was both right and wrong at the same time). <br/>You are just another religious nutcase.<br/>You continue believing that it must have started somewhere, because it must have a beginning,<br/>because everything has.<br/><br/>Real strong proof. Everything has a start and an ending, so the universe must have too.<br/>Something like 'I created everything in my image'.<br/>Found the end of the 'expanding' universe yet?<br/><br/>Yep, must have pushed the right button here, since 90% of the room just left.<br/><br/><br/>So you are an anarchist.<br/>Really? You are wearing clothes. Did you make them yourself? Where did you get the raw material?<br/>Are you cold? Or are you just protecting yourself from sexual harassment?<br/>Aah, you need no boss huh. I can relate to that. But you must stop reading now, because in this book I am your boss,<br/>and you will do what I tell you.<br/><br/>I am a firm believer in 'Zachte heelmeesters maken stinkende wonden'. So grow up and follow my orders.<br/>Still reading? You whimp! I thought I told you to stand up for what you believe. <br/>You are not an anarchist, you are a zelot. <br/><br/><br/>No, I am wrong. You are still reading, so you are yourself.<br/>Finally alone. Now we are getting somewhere.<br/><br/><br/><br/>INNOCENCE<br/><br/>No you fool, the referree says. The mosquito has won. He was not aware of carrying your killer.<br/>He has no capability to do that. You are far superior to the mosquito in the art of reasoning.<br/>You shouldn't even have been allowed as a player. The mosquito is innocent, and you killed him. <br/>You broke multiple rules in this game, and are about to receive your punishment.<br/>Since the mosquito is dead he has lost too. Therefore I am declaring this game a mistrial. <br/>It never happened and will be stricken from the record.<br/><br/>Hold on referree. This game never happened, you say. So your ruling never happened either.<br/>You don't even have any authority here.<br/>I won't let you off that easy. Prove it to me. Prove to me you have authority in this game.<br/>Undo the dead mosquito or revisit the case.<br/>I am about to become the loser, but not in return for the innocence of the mosquito. <br/>Quite the opposite. I am losing this game because of the guilt of the mosquito.<br/><br/><br/>Starting to like this switching-labels-on-every-bounce theory.<br/><br/>Let`s see.<br/>The mosquito delivered punishment for what I was about to do, without him, me or <br/>the referree knowing about it. <br/>You did see 'Minority Report'. <br/>'About to do' is not future tense. <br/>At the moment of stinging we were all innocent.<br/>Therefore nobody broke the rules.<br/>The mosquito died first. That's when he became the loser, I became the winner and the <br/>game ended right there.<br/>And dear referree: Your authority ended right there with it.<br/><br/><br/>Almost did it. Came close to absolution. <br/>Couldn't get it though. Still feel like crap.<br/><br/><br/>You are dying. Who the hell cares about killing a dangerous dengue mosquito <br/>because he might have been innocent. You are one species, he is another.<br/>You kill eachother. That`s what species do. <br/>You remember Darwin devoted his whole life trying to prove this.<br/>And a whole bunch of others are closing his gaps every day.<br/>It is just like that. Now accept it and die, will you!<br/>I want to get home to my wife, but I can't leave untill game over.<br/><br/><br/>Who started the game, referree? Wasn't it you, who bigbanged his starter pistol.<br/>You are not going anywhere, because the game is still on. And I am so stubborn, that <br/>I just won't die until you give me a sensible ruling. <br/><br/>And you Darwin, you shut up too. Apes? You're serious?<br/>I don't see no ape when I look in the mirror. I am far superior to apes, mosquito's,<br/>virusses, elephants, dolhpins, hell all of `em. They don't even know their own name.<br/>And in the rare cases they do, they can't say it out loud, or write it.<br/><br/>Yeah, It must be the thumb and potatoes that got us the industrial revolution. Or maybe the chinese<br/>with their gunpowder.<br/>Will you finally give in, and tell the truth. As soon as you start replacing<br/>the words 'proof' , 'is' , 'was' with phrasing like 'might be' or 'could have been', I'll let you back in.<br/>For now, off to the principal`s office.<br/><br/>Religious nutcase. You join Darwin. To the principal`s office. Seven days? <br/>It took me aeons. And it is still work in progress.<br/><br/>Told you many times now. It has no beginning, neither an end.<br/>I love to watch you running in circles though.<br/><br/>I am a sadist you know. And worse I created you in my own image. That must suck.<br/>For you as well as for me. <br/>A neverending game, with no players, no audience, no rules, no winners nor losers.<br/>Just a corrupt referree, who wants to go home to his wife, but can't because he just<br/>can't finish the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>NO MEANING<br/><br/>Yesterday Beto told me that he just doesn't care about Zeitgeist. He likes documentaries,<br/>but as entertainment. And he told me it is best to avoid three topics: football (the real one, not the US one),<br/>politics and religion.<br/>These topics have no meaning to him, since they are 'a given'.<br/>Much like gravity they are just there. No 'Why'. Just a 'What'.<br/><br/>Ofcourse I immediately revoked his license to read my book, but he did not care, continued reading and<br/>stated that it is all about learning and teaching.<br/><br/>Oh class, almost forgot: you need to watch Zeitgeist 1,2 &amp; 3. Or the news of a decade ago, both of your country and it's<br/>proclaimed enemies`; and the news of today, of both too; you can skip everything in between. Zeitgeist is just a summary.<br/><br/>See what I see?<br/>Same stuff, their names, faces, labels changed.<br/><br/>The 'What' seems to be the only constant.<br/>No 'Why' found yet.<br/><br/>The seemingly intelligent documentary/movie is yet another manipulation attempt. <br/>Trying to derail the most important figure this planet has ever seen.<br/>Jesus of Nazareth. Zeitgeist even tries to elaborately steal one of Jesus` most important commandments: <br/>'Give all the money back to the guy who's head is printed on it'.<br/><br/>Zeitgeist does not even get close to the 'Why' in it's reasoning. <br/>It does bring us a 'solution' though. Change bankaccount and change yourself.<br/><br/>Zeitgeist is dangerous and irresponsible. Because it is compelling.<br/>Adolf would be so proud and jealous at the same time. If you don't snap out of it,<br/>you will be sitting frontrow scientology before you know it. They even used near subliminal.<br/><br/>Real freedom. Living in a circle, controlled by robot's.<br/>And all because you are jealous of a guy who died a horrible death on a cross<br/>for being kind, and not to mention for being right.<br/><br/>No wonder I am a sadist. You all need to be punished.<br/>Killing my son as if he where a mosquito.<br/><br/>Did I just say that? <br/>I need some sleep.<br/>Or a vacation maybe.<br/><br/><br/>FIRST LAPS<br/><br/>I have decided that I need to learn something today. Need to<br/>balance the Beto-scale. After our first few bounces we got <br/>the feel of our game and our opponents. It is going to be a lot of fun.<br/><br/>You undoubtedly have concluded that I am a terrible writer. Never had training.<br/>Making it up as I go. Ever saw the movie 'Memento'? Bouncing back and forth. <br/>Using future events to explain past ones.<br/><br/>Let`s try and put some logic on that.<br/><br/>You can only say 'About to' when chronologically relating past events.<br/><br/>Hold on, just learned something. <br/>Time doesn't go backward, neither does it go forward.<br/>Our perception of it occurs on every bounce. <br/>And like a deja-vu we switch label to give meaning to the next bounce.<br/><br/>What?<br/>I know you like to start at the end, and work your way back, which by the way is<br/>impossible since you hold up there is no end.<br/>How did you get to your there-is-no-time-just-label-switching theory?<br/><br/><br/>Obviously I don't know that yet. To know that I must work my way backwards first.<br/>Kind of confusing, 'first', 'previous', 'next', 'last'.<br/>Only have meaning in between bounces, when time stands still and therefore these words<br/>have no meaning. On the bounce they all have the same meaning: 'previous' turns into 'next',<br/>'first' turns into 'last'`<br/><br/>Stuck.<br/><br/>Go at it again.<br/>If Thomas Edison would have given up after a few laps, we would still be hanging around in the dark,<br/>just as Darwin`s apes.<br/><br/>How did I get here?<br/>I don't remember. Why not?<br/><br/>Have to dissapoint you. Not years of study on MIT or Harvard. <br/>Just popped into my head. Don't know where I got it.<br/>Can't explain it.<br/>Doesn't even make sense. Yet I know it is right.<br/>Still don't know WHY though. <br/>Let alone the HOW.<br/><br/>Ideas pooring in now.<br/>Faster than I can type them out.<br/>I'll take them LIFO.<br/><br/>Last in first out. <br/>If my there-is-no-time-just-label-switching theory would make sense, then<br/>cause and effect are the same thing. They come into existance together, one being the opposite<br/>of the other, in order to create movement or time, only to be perceived when effect meets cause, right on the<br/>bounce.<br/><br/>Close, but not quite there yet.<br/>Why did cause and effect come in existance together?<br/><br/>I have got to go Edison on this one. We need to specify to get some<br/>handle on this abstract mess. <br/><br/>We? <br/><br/>Well yeah, you think I can do this alone. I'm not God.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ARE YOU INSANE<br/><br/>The mosquito species and I seem to have reached somekind of live and let live status. There are quite a lot<br/>of them hovering through the room, yet they don't seem to want to kill me anymore. And eventhough I<br/>have my kill-the-dengue-mosquito-spray-gun right next to me, I let them live.<br/><br/>Pretty insane huh. We both are now defying Darwin. <br/>I'm sorry. I am far to hard on the man. Obviously he was a bould, daring genius, who selflessly contributed<br/>his whole life, to go up against both the establishment and it's slaves. <br/>Not unlike Jesus, Gandhi, Mandela, Semler, Neo.<br/><br/>And he was right. The gaps are not his fault at all. His life was too short. If only the genetic<br/>engineering of today, the direct consequence of his work, would have been available, he would be<br/>here with the rest of us. I'm thinking Jurassic Parc. Let's find a bone of Darwin, recreate him,<br/>recreate his whole life inside a dome, like that movie with Jim Carey, and when he is about to die again, we<br/>invite him into our classroom. <br/>We give him a shot at correcting his followers` interpretations and correcting us; sorry, me.<br/><br/>I am sure that I am not an ape, and that I never was one too.<br/>That's insane, isn't it. Evidence piling up all over, and I still don't<br/>want to acknowledge I was an ape.<br/><br/>I must be faking it. My believe in Jesus.<br/>How would you ever know. It is my game.<br/><br/>Besides I am still very angry with you humans for killing Ghandi,<br/>and of course my only son Jesus. <br/>Lucky for you, my father thought me to count to ten, otherwise you<br/>would have been rotting in hell a long time ago. <br/><br/>Gotta stop this bouncing. Need to go home to my wife and watch some Dr. House.<br/><br/><br/><br/>DR. HOUSE<br/><br/>In the documentation department Dr. House unfortunately trumps my son Jesus. The good doctor<br/>has performed over 200 miracles, all videotaped. And my son? The whimp got his ass kicked by a bunch of<br/>lame Romans, who were busy having orgies all day long, not to mention the coward jews and filistines, sucking up <br/>to the lame Romans. Where where the Turks then. Or Dhengis. Or the Vikings.<br/>They would have done a better job protecting my son.<br/><br/>Look, he was wrong about this turn-the-other-cheek thing. But Darwin wasn't around then, to teach him different.<br/>The boy was innocent, and they killed him just like that. As if he were a mosquito.<br/><br/>He was right about the money thing though. He just forgot to do the Robin Hood. In order to give the money back, you do need<br/>to get it first, see. <br/>I always liked his bread and fish metaphore. I created this place to have more than enough for <br/>all of you idiots. If you would just share it, and take only what you need, you all can go do what the<br/>Romans did. Have orgies all day long.<br/>Oh, and not to forget, live forever.<br/><br/>Whenever you are about to die, we call in Dr. House to do one of his miracles. <br/>(Poor bastard still doesn't know that it was me doing all of that. But I love him so much that I won't tell.<br/>It would shatter his ego)<br/><br/>God, I miss him. I miss them both. They were so good.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>GOD IS AN ATHEIST<br/><br/><br/>Sorry. Broke my own rule. God could be an atheist. <br/>It adds up.<br/>Obviously there are no true believers on this planet.<br/>If there were, we would be living forever in paradise.<br/><br/>Since God created man in his own image, He must be an atheist.<br/>Which would make a lot of sense if He was the first 'Why'.<br/><br/>(Did I just switch cause and effect`s labeling?)<br/><br/>Yet He keeps sending all these messengers telling there is no beginning and no end.<br/>Now he must have learned that from someone. Which means he has a father an so on and so on.<br/><br/>If He just made that up, than He would be a liar. <br/>Someone who always lies.<br/>Something about being chained to the bottom of the sea comes to mind.<br/><br/><br/>Let's take Him out of the equation.<br/>Why would He create something, that has no beginning and no end. There is no joy in that.<br/><br/><br/>Damn. The scientologists are right. I was crazy al along. Believing in God,<br/>and Jesus being his own father. A criminal for doing his own mother.<br/><br/>Good call from the Romans. Crucify the bastard, and let's go back to doing our sisters, mothers,<br/>and Caligula too. Smart of them to use the jews to take the blame. <br/><br/>How many religious people on this planet?<br/><br/>So God must be insane too.<br/>How so? I just concluded he does not exist at all.<br/><br/>Leave Him alone. He's just a Good Guy who unfortunately never existed.<br/>Like Dr. House.<br/><br/>We humans are rotten, evil, self-centered psychopaths, always lying and stealing<br/>to get what we want, but never getting what we need. <br/><br/>And don't blame God. He has told you many times what you should be doing. <br/>It was you who didn't listen.<br/><br/>Is Darwin revived yet?<br/>We are in need of explanations here.<br/><br/><br/>Let's ask the probability-theorists, or should I say alchemists or wiches.<br/>You know. The guys that can't repeat the same experiment twice, but don't<br/>want to blame their own tools. The Nobel-hungry quantum psycho`s. <br/><br/>They rather invoke magic, and then blame the failure on the real scientists.<br/>At least the real scientists and the other religious nutjobs stand for what they believe in.<br/>The quantum jojo`s believe in bouncing. Probability. Two opposite states simultaneously.<br/>That kind of impossible stuff.<br/><br/>She loves me, she loves me not, she loves me, He loves me not, I love Him, I love Him not.<br/>Out of leaves.<br/>Damn. I love Him not.<br/><br/>Take another flower and try again.<br/>Eventually you will be a purple crocodile.<br/><br/>At least according to what the jojo`s are saying. Given enough tries everything is possible.<br/>Or they like to refer to it as choices.<br/><br/>Probably my biggest mistake. Giving you humans free will, choice.<br/>You weren't ready for that. But the apes were. <br/>And all other creatures on the planet. <br/><br/>How could I have missed that. You don't get to have a thumb AND free will.<br/>Before you know it you think you are god.<br/><br/>Ooh. Hurt your feelings now huh. Good. You shouldn't have killed my son.<br/>I am still angry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>MESSENGER<br/><br/>Did I mention my other messenger, John Lennon.<br/>1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.<br/><br/>Killed him too huh. Pretty insane. The killing, not John.<br/>John obviously was right. <br/>Instead of doing what was told, you morons created religions.<br/>Putting the messengers on pedestals, instead of yourselves.<br/>You get to climb a pedestal because of your actions, not because of your believes.<br/><br/>Please do what John said. <br/>Stop going to someone elses church and be a pastor of your own church.<br/>You don't want me to get medieval on your ass.<br/>(Sorry, couldn't help it. Best phrase ever, from best movie ever)<br/><br/>And I can, you know. <br/>It's just the counting my father tought me, what's holding me back.<br/><br/><br/>Did you notice something in my writing. Seems that the paragraphs get shorter and shorter.<br/>Running out of ideas. Out of time.<br/><br/>Homework: watch 'Out of time'.<br/><br/><br/><br/>MANY MUST DIE FOR A FEW TO LIVE FOREVER<br/><br/>Best example is Adolf. Or is it Adolph. The absolute champion of<br/>champions. Dhengis was not bad. Stalin certainly lived up to expectations.<br/>The Bushes get a B for trying. But Adolph trumps them all by a landslide.<br/><br/>He used jewish-German efficiency, technology and deception to exterminate <br/>the 'jewish' part. Leaving the world today filled with 'German' technology,<br/>and Germany as one of the strongest peoples / nations on this globe.<br/><br/>No Darwinian will say it openly, but if you are a true Darwinian, Hitler is your god.<br/><br/>Leads me to think, that part of the jews must have secretly listened to Jesus 2000 years ago,<br/>specifically to the turn-the-other-cheek part. Do you believe it. What are the odds.<br/>The only wrong thing my son said, and they had to follow that command, but the rest,<br/>which was right, they didn't follow.<br/><br/>When someone hits you in the face, you hit him back twice, twice as hard, or you die trying.<br/>Homework for jews only: 'Inglorious Bastards'.<br/><br/>Rest can watch too. Very amusing. Very true. Very natural. Very necessary.<br/><br/><br/>Fired my anti-dengue-spray. Killed at least seven mosquitos, after two failed attacks <br/>from their side. Still some hovering above me. See if can renew the mutual stand-down.<br/>Somehow I am not afraid anymore, now that I'm dying anyway. They attack. I kill them.<br/>No remorse. No second thoughts, like before.<br/><br/>But still remorse over that first mosquito though. What has changed?<br/>It can't be Darwin. If it were him, I would be on a crusade, killing all mosquitos<br/>on the planet pre-emptively. <br/>Superiority? Then I would be feeling remorse for all of them.<br/><br/>It must be that I adscribe huge intelligence to them. I consider them my peers.<br/>I know they have learned that I was remorseful, and willing to forgive the first mosquito<br/>for not knowing. But now they know.<br/>And they know, that I know that they know.<br/>They know I was willing to share my blood so they could feed.<br/>They know they are infected by the virus, and that that's why I don't want them to sting me.<br/>They know the game is over.<br/><br/>Yet, they attacked. And I evaded, defended and struck back. No remorse.<br/>I am superior. At least in this game.<br/>But I don't feel superior.<br/>That would be an insult to the mosquitos.<br/>I respect them.<br/><br/>They are God's creatures.<br/>Here for a reason.<br/><br/><br/>Another Blitz. This one got me. Again.<br/>Time for medieval.<br/><br/><br/><br/>WHAT`S MISSING<br/><br/><br/>Where is the audience? What is their role? Can there even be a game without an audience?<br/>Are they a player too? Who's side are they on?<br/>Can they do anything about the result?<br/><br/>Will you stop?<br/>Life is not a game. There are no rules.<br/>Ofcourse a tree has just fallen over in a Finnish forest. And the cat is dead in the box.<br/><br/>These facts don't change, whether you watch them or not. You are just not aware of them.<br/><br/>I tried that, you know. I watched the tape of the final Holland-Germany over and over. Same result<br/>every time. No crocodile anywhere.<br/><br/>Johan Cruijff said it. He could not understand why both teams were praying to win the game.<br/>The secret was different coloured socks. Shortlived though, because the other players soon picked up on that one.<br/><br/><br/>Quantum-jojo`s are out. Stand for something please. Make a choice.<br/><br/><br/>You can't throw us out. You created us. We are legitimate players. You invented<br/>this free-will thing. You even admitted it was a mistake. If You want to change the rules OK, but<br/>not during the game. This neverending game...<br/><br/>Got me there.<br/>No getting out of this one. Smart cookies. My image...<br/><br/>Wait a minute.<br/>I am all powerful. Where is my spray.<br/><br/>Better watch out. They might kill you. They are all-powerful too, being a copy.<br/>And they outnumber you.<br/><br/>Come on. My own kids wouldn't kill me. Would they? <br/>Euthanasia? That's what they would use? Devious bastards.<br/><br/>It might be jealousy that will overwhelm them. You are always saying<br/>that Jesus is your only son. That's a slap in the face. <br/>And you just said that if someone slaps you...<br/><br/>Yeah. Might be better to retire. Alzheimer is getting to me.<br/>Bring on Greg to figure out why I am losing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>DIAGNOSYS<br/><br/>Clearly you suffer from mirror syndrome. You are trying to be me.<br/>Can't be done. However I must say you are doing a great job.<br/><br/>But Greg, I created you. Am I such a lousy actor that I can't even mimic my own creation,<br/>my own son? <br/><br/>That`s the mirror problem dad. You are always gonna be one step behind or one step<br/>ahead. You can mimic me to near perfection, but the audience will always know who`s copying who.<br/><br/>Is there a cure Greg? Can you fix me?<br/><br/>Sorry dad. No cure. Only one Dr. House, and he is retired; or dead.<br/><br/>But I miss you.<br/>Can't I create the new and improved Dr. House.<br/>I want to revive you.<br/>Promise me you won't be mad.<br/><br/>Are you insane. You want to take me off my pedestal?<br/>I earned it. I will be mad at you. I will deny you!<br/><br/><br/>That doesn't scare me. Deny me all you want. But I don't want you to be mad at me,<br/>so I will find someone else to mirror. I can get the occasional consult, yes?<br/><br/><br/>OK. But it will not be very interesting. We have our diagnosys.<br/>Maybe if you could contract some outerspace disease. <br/><br/>I have one for you Greg. I seem to be expanding all the time. You know, growing bigger and bigger.<br/>But my mass stays the same. It`s like I am a balloon being inflated by nothingness, by empty space.<br/>And I have no skin.<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>indiegogo allows up to 60.000 characters.

Now on page 47.I have changed the title two times, and am about to change it again to INCOMPLETE.My pseudonym is John Smith. The book started assome random statements, but is now starting to go somewhere.My funding request primarily serves the purpose of myphysical survival, but is also a test to see if there is a chance I actually will get published.If you like me to write more, and change the title to COMPLETE, choose an upvote perk.If you hate it, choose a downvote perk.If you want to be heard, there is a perk for that too.Goes without saying that every contributor will receive a signed copywhen my book gets published.So without further ado here are the first 47 pages:------------------------------------------------------------------THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.MINDGAMESIf a mosquito transporting hemoragic dengue fever stings me, but I kill it slapping him right after the sting, who has won, if anybody?First of all, to be able to decide on 'winning', 'losing' or a 'draw', there must bea game with criteria or rules, and players. The players must also be aware of the rulesbefore playing. And we need a referee, to interpret the 'facts' to declare a result.Secondly we need an audience, preferrably partial, to create the illusion that thisgame has any meaning. Thirdly we need a beginning and an end. Without a beginning we would not know when the rulesare in effect. Without an end we would not come to a result.In my mosquito example, all of the above is missing, which would logically lead to astatement like 'life is not a game' or 'life has no meaning'.When I lay there bleeding out from the dengue fever however, I have a strong sense that themosquito has won.So why is that? Why do I have this feeling that there was a game going on, of which I and the mosquito knew the rules al along, and the mosquito just outsmarted me.And even with him dying in the process he still won.Could it be that I felt superior to the mosquito, because I assumed that I was smarter?And if so, why did I assume I was smarter?In a note to the reader I warn you that this lecture has no meaning at all, that it does not havea beginning, neither an end, that it will not give you any answers and will give you a lot of answers at the same time,that it will make you a either a zelot, an anarchist or yourself.Back to my feeling of defeat. I feel defeat in a game. So what were the rules?He was allowed to sting me for food - my blood - since I have a ton of itcompared to his needs, but he was not allowed to infect me with deadly dengue fever.Or was he?If he was, that could mean a rule of this game is 'you die, you lose'.Then it would be a draw, since we both are dead.Since I don't feel it is a draw, it must be that he was not allowed to infect me.He broke the rule, so let's go to the referee. The referee states that I have won, according to the rules 'whoever breaks the rules loses' and 'the game ends when we have a winner'.No didn't help. I still feel like a loser, and I feel betrayed. I need to go to a higher authority.The guilty must be punished. But the mosquito is already declared 'loser' by the referree. Furthermore he is dead.Nothing left to punish.The result appears to have no meaning. Does that mean there was no game to begin with?Or does it mean that the rules have no bearing on and connection with reality? Again, the definition of a game.Oh, I get it now. It must be that I want it to be a game, so I can start over.Sounds familiar, doesn't it.Comforting even.Why does this happen to me? Who did this to me? Who is to blame for me losing the game?Yep, I feel it coming. Wild anger and rage.After ten seconds (my father tought me to count to ten whenever my emotions threaten to get mebreaking the rules), my rationalization kicks in: 'I screwed up. I did't kill off al the dengue mosquitosin a pre-emptive strike'. 'The mosquito can't help it that he is carrying the dengue fever. He didn't even know it'Noo. Superiority again. Can you prove the mosquito has no knowledge of dengue fever? For all you know theyare best friends, teaming up to kill off this human in a pre-emptive strike.Yeah, sure. Smart mosquito's and smart viusses, conspiring together to nail you. Little paranoia, don't you think?Well, it wouldn't be paranoid if it were true.OK. Let's explore it. Dengue mosquito's find small pools of water everywhere to procreate. How do they do that? Can theysmell water? And if so, is that a sign of intelligence? At least one meaning of the word intelligence certainly covers it.Being able to find weapons of mass destruction in some desert or on some island is considered to be intelligent. So much eventhat there is an Agency for it in existance.I'll run with that. I state that dengue mosquito's are intelligent, and therefore have the capability to team up withthe dengue fever virus to launch a pre-emptive strike against humans, their main enemy. What about the dengue virus. Is that intelligent? Could it even be calling the shots?Why does it even exist? Is it aware there is a game going on, and does it play by it's rules?That word again. 'Why'.  So difficult to answer. Much more difficult than 'Where', 'How', 'When', 'What'.Seems that the latter four are a result of the first one. Moreeven, the latter four seem not toexist without the first one. And they are of different cardinality. For one 'Why' can existmultiple 'How`s', for one 'How' can exist multiple 'Where`s' , for one 'Where' can exist multiple'When`s' and 'What`s'No, wait a minute. For one Where-How-When-What combo could also exist multiple 'Why`s'.More causes to one effect? More effects to one cause? More instances attributing to one effect?That last one is pretty mind-boggling. If it were truly possible, it would mean that time and place and even methodhave no role in the cause-effect theory. It would just be bouncing back and forth between 'Why`s' and 'What`s'. Each bounce both cause and effect switching it's label.Gives me two new questions.The everlasting who-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg question.And a MetaWhy. Together with a MetaWhat.Stop. This has no end. Like the endless reflections in two opposed mirrors.Again. From the ground up.I did not die yet. But surely it can't be much longer. Blood pooring out ofmy leaking skin. Could I still win? How? The referree stated that the mosquito is the loser, because he broke a rule, anddeclared me a winner. What rule did the mosquito break?The mosquito brought a hidden extra player to the game. Neither the referree nor me where informed about this extra player. I still feel like crap though; like a loser.So I must have broken a rule too, and the referree must have missed that.Yep, got it. I did not trust the mosquito that he was only going totake a little of my blood, which I could easily miss. For if I did trust on thatI would not have killed him. I would just have sent him on his way with a soft sweep.The way a horse uses his tail.All sorts of conclusions start showing up.The main rule of this game is not 'You die, you lose', but 'You live, you win'I want to live, but I don't know why.I am alive, but I don't know why.The mosquito is dead, an he lost his game.The mosquito is dead, but still is a player in my game.I lost the game too, because I broke a rule too.The game is still going on with no players.Sort of proves the bouncing I was talking about earlier. The mosquito is still dead,but he is an active player in my game. I already lost because I broke a rule, but the game is still going on,because I am not dead yet, and I am therefore a continuous winner?I am going in circles here.If it is a game, with a beginning and an end, with a winner and a loser, it cannot haveas it's main rule 'You live, you win'. Since I surely feel that that is the main rule, it cannot be a game.And if it is, I am not playing. I would have no chance to win.Sure miss God.STICKING AROUND FOR NERDSHi players. Most of you did not survive the first round. And yes, that was intentional.If we are going to have mind games and resolve the unifying theory, we don't needtrolls nor morons to cramp our style.If you are going to read on, I demand your complete attention and devotion to stand up for what you believe is right.Kinda like Bill Gates does. 'You want to use my software, your arse belongs to me'.So shout at this story, tell me I am wrong, but most of all WHY.At the end you will be either a zelot, an anarchist or yourself.It is my game so I start with the results, and we will work back from there.So you are a zelot. You continue believing that the earth is flat, because it is, because God said so.You are shorttracking the 'Why' here. And you are right of course. It must have started somewhere.At the firstever 'Why'. The big bang you say. Didn't know God was so loud.Yes, you too Einstein (Just a nickname for you nerd; The real deal knew he was both right and wrong at the same time). You are just another religious nutcase.You continue believing that it must have started somewhere, because it must have a beginning,because everything has.Real strong proof. Everything has a start and an ending, so the universe must have too.Something like 'I created everything in my image'.Found the end of the 'expanding' universe yet?Yep, must have pushed the right button here, since 90% of the room just left.So you are an anarchist.Really? You are wearing clothes. Did you make them yourself? Where did you get the raw material?Are you cold? Or are you just protecting yourself from sexual harassment?Aah, you need no boss huh. I can relate to that. But you must stop reading now, because in this book I am your boss,and you will do what I tell you.I am a firm believer in 'Zachte heelmeesters maken stinkende wonden'. So grow up and follow my orders.Still reading? You whimp! I thought I told you to stand up for what you believe. You are not an anarchist, you are a zelot. No, I am wrong. You are still reading, so you are yourself.Finally alone. Now we are getting somewhere.INNOCENCENo you fool, the referree says. The mosquito has won. He was not aware of carrying your killer.He has no capability to do that. You are far superior to the mosquito in the art of reasoning.You shouldn't even have been allowed as a player. The mosquito is innocent, and you killed him. You broke multiple rules in this game, and are about to receive your punishment.Since the mosquito is dead he has lost too. Therefore I am declaring this game a mistrial. It never happened and will be stricken from the record.Hold on referree. This game never happened, you say. So your ruling never happened either.You don't even have any authority here.I won't let you off that easy. Prove it to me. Prove to me you have authority in this game.Undo the dead mosquito or revisit the case.I am about to become the loser, but not in return for the innocence of the mosquito. Quite the opposite. I am losing this game because of the guilt of the mosquito.Starting to like this switching-labels-on-every-bounce theory.Let`s see.The mosquito delivered punishment for what I was about to do, without him, me or the referree knowing about it. You did see 'Minority Report'. 'About to do' is not future tense. At the moment of stinging we were all innocent.Therefore nobody broke the rules.The mosquito died first. That's when he became the loser, I became the winner and the game ended right there.And dear referree: Your authority ended right there with it.Almost did it. Came close to absolution. Couldn't get it though. Still feel like crap.You are dying. Who the hell cares about killing a dangerous dengue mosquito because he might have been innocent. You are one species, he is another.You kill eachother. That`s what species do. You remember Darwin devoted his whole life trying to prove this.And a whole bunch of others are closing his gaps every day.It is just like that. Now accept it and die, will you!I want to get home to my wife, but I can't leave untill game over.Who started the game, referree? Wasn't it you, who bigbanged his starter pistol.You are not going anywhere, because the game is still on. And I am so stubborn, that I just won't die until you give me a sensible ruling. And you Darwin, you shut up too. Apes? You're serious?I don't see no ape when I look in the mirror. I am far superior to apes, mosquito's,virusses, elephants, dolhpins, hell all of `em. They don't even know their own name.And in the rare cases they do, they can't say it out loud, or write it.Yeah, It must be the thumb and potatoes that got us the industrial revolution. Or maybe the chinesewith their gunpowder.Will you finally give in, and tell the truth. As soon as you start replacingthe words 'proof' , 'is' , 'was' with phrasing like 'might be' or 'could have been', I'll let you back in.For now, off to the principal`s office.Religious nutcase. You join Darwin. To the principal`s office. Seven days? It took me aeons. And it is still work in progress.Told you many times now. It has no beginning, neither an end.I love to watch you running in circles though.I am a sadist you know. And worse I created you in my own image. That must suck.For you as well as for me. A neverending game, with no players, no audience, no rules, no winners nor losers.Just a corrupt referree, who wants to go home to his wife, but can't because he justcan't finish the game.NO MEANINGYesterday Beto told me that he just doesn't care about Zeitgeist. He likes documentaries,but as entertainment. And he told me it is best to avoid three topics: football (the real one, not the US one),politics and religion.These topics have no meaning to him, since they are 'a given'.Much like gravity they are just there. No 'Why'. Just a 'What'.Ofcourse I immediately revoked his license to read my book, but he did not care, continued reading andstated that it is all about learning and teaching.Oh class, almost forgot: you need to watch Zeitgeist 1,2 & 3. Or the news of a decade ago, both of your country and it'sproclaimed enemies`; and the news of today, of both too; you can skip everything in between. Zeitgeist is just a summary.See what I see?Same stuff, their names, faces, labels changed.The 'What' seems to be the only constant.No 'Why' found yet.The seemingly intelligent documentary/movie is yet another manipulation attempt. Trying to derail the most important figure this planet has ever seen.Jesus of Nazareth. Zeitgeist even tries to elaborately steal one of Jesus` most important commandments: 'Give all the money back to the guy who's head is printed on it'.Zeitgeist does not even get close to the 'Why' in it's reasoning. It does bring us a 'solution' though. Change bankaccount and change yourself.Zeitgeist is dangerous and irresponsible. Because it is compelling.Adolf would be so proud and jealous at the same time. If you don't snap out of it,you will be sitting frontrow scientology before you know it. They even used near subliminal.Real freedom. Living in a circle, controlled by robot's.And all because you are jealous of a guy who died a horrible death on a crossfor being kind, and not to mention for being right.No wonder I am a sadist. You all need to be punished.Killing my son as if he where a mosquito.Did I just say that? I need some sleep.Or a vacation maybe.FIRST LAPSI have decided that I need to learn something today. Need tobalance the Beto-scale. After our first few bounces we got the feel of our game and our opponents. It is going to be a lot of fun.You undoubtedly have concluded that I am a terrible writer. Never had training.Making it up as I go. Ever saw the movie 'Memento'? Bouncing back and forth. Using future events to explain past ones.Let`s try and put some logic on that.You can only say 'About to' when chronologically relating past events.Hold on, just learned something. Time doesn't go backward, neither does it go forward.Our perception of it occurs on every bounce. And like a deja-vu we switch label to give meaning to the next bounce.What?I know you like to start at the end, and work your way back, which by the way isimpossible since you hold up there is no end.How did you get to your there-is-no-time-just-label-switching theory?Obviously I don't know that yet. To know that I must work my way backwards first.Kind of confusing, 'first', 'previous', 'next', 'last'.Only have meaning in between bounces, when time stands still and therefore these wordshave no meaning. On the bounce they all have the same meaning: 'previous' turns into 'next','first' turns into 'last'`Stuck.Go at it again.If Thomas Edison would have given up after a few laps, we would still be hanging around in the dark,just as Darwin`s apes.How did I get here?I don't remember. Why not?Have to dissapoint you. Not years of study on MIT or Harvard. Just popped into my head. Don't know where I got it.Can't explain it.Doesn't even make sense. Yet I know it is right.Still don't know WHY though. Let alone the HOW.Ideas pooring in now.Faster than I can type them out.I'll take them LIFO.Last in first out. If my there-is-no-time-just-label-switching theory would make sense, thencause and effect are the same thing. They come into existance together, one being the oppositeof the other, in order to create movement or time, only to be perceived when effect meets cause, right on thebounce.Close, but not quite there yet.Why did cause and effect come in existance together?I have got to go Edison on this one. We need to specify to get somehandle on this abstract mess. We? Well yeah, you think I can do this alone. I'm not God.ARE YOU INSANEThe mosquito species and I seem to have reached somekind of live and let live status. There are quite a lotof them hovering through the room, yet they don't seem to want to kill me anymore. And eventhough Ihave my kill-the-dengue-mosquito-spray-gun right next to me, I let them live.Pretty insane huh. We both are now defying Darwin. I'm sorry. I am far to hard on the man. Obviously he was a bould, daring genius, who selflessly contributedhis whole life, to go up against both the establishment and it's slaves. Not unlike Jesus, Gandhi, Mandela, Semler, Neo.And he was right. The gaps are not his fault at all. His life was too short. If only the geneticengineering of today, the direct consequence of his work, would have been available, he would behere with the rest of us. I'm thinking Jurassic Parc. Let's find a bone of Darwin, recreate him,recreate his whole life inside a dome, like that movie with Jim Carey, and when he is about to die again, weinvite him into our classroom. We give him a shot at correcting his followers` interpretations and correcting us; sorry, me.I am sure that I am not an ape, and that I never was one too.That's insane, isn't it. Evidence piling up all over, and I still don'twant to acknowledge I was an ape.I must be faking it. My believe in Jesus.How would you ever know. It is my game.Besides I am still very angry with you humans for killing Ghandi,and of course my only son Jesus. Lucky for you, my father thought me to count to ten, otherwise youwould have been rotting in hell a long time ago. Gotta stop this bouncing. Need to go home to my wife and watch some Dr. House.DR. HOUSEIn the documentation department Dr. House unfortunately trumps my son Jesus. The good doctorhas performed over 200 miracles, all videotaped. And my son? The whimp got his ass kicked by a bunch oflame Romans, who were busy having orgies all day long, not to mention the coward jews and filistines, sucking up to the lame Romans. Where where the Turks then. Or Dhengis. Or the Vikings.They would have done a better job protecting my son.Look, he was wrong about this turn-the-other-cheek thing. But Darwin wasn't around then, to teach him different.The boy was innocent, and they killed him just like that. As if he were a mosquito.He was right about the money thing though. He just forgot to do the Robin Hood. In order to give the money back, you do needto get it first, see. I always liked his bread and fish metaphore. I created this place to have more than enough for all of you idiots. If you would just share it, and take only what you need, you all can go do what theRomans did. Have orgies all day long.Oh, and not to forget, live forever.Whenever you are about to die, we call in Dr. House to do one of his miracles. (Poor bastard still doesn't know that it was me doing all of that. But I love him so much that I won't tell.It would shatter his ego)God, I miss him. I miss them both. They were so good.GOD IS AN ATHEISTSorry. Broke my own rule. God could be an atheist. It adds up.Obviously there are no true believers on this planet.If there were, we would be living forever in paradise.Since God created man in his own image, He must be an atheist.Which would make a lot of sense if He was the first 'Why'.(Did I just switch cause and effect`s labeling?)Yet He keeps sending all these messengers telling there is no beginning and no end.Now he must have learned that from someone. Which means he has a father an so on and so on.If He just made that up, than He would be a liar. Someone who always lies.Something about being chained to the bottom of the sea comes to mind.Let's take Him out of the equation.Why would He create something, that has no beginning and no end. There is no joy in that.Damn. The scientologists are right. I was crazy al along. Believing in God,and Jesus being his own father. A criminal for doing his own mother.Good call from the Romans. Crucify the bastard, and let's go back to doing our sisters, mothers,and Caligula too. Smart of them to use the jews to take the blame. How many religious people on this planet?So God must be insane too.How so? I just concluded he does not exist at all.Leave Him alone. He's just a Good Guy who unfortunately never existed.Like Dr. House.We humans are rotten, evil, self-centered psychopaths, always lying and stealingto get what we want, but never getting what we need. And don't blame God. He has told you many times what you should be doing. It was you who didn't listen.Is Darwin revived yet?We are in need of explanations here.Let's ask the probability-theorists, or should I say alchemists or wiches.You know. The guys that can't repeat the same experiment twice, but don'twant to blame their own tools. The Nobel-hungry quantum psycho`s. They rather invoke magic, and then blame the failure on the real scientists.At least the real scientists and the other religious nutjobs stand for what they believe in.The quantum jojo`s believe in bouncing. Probability. Two opposite states simultaneously.That kind of impossible stuff.She loves me, she loves me not, she loves me, He loves me not, I love Him, I love Him not.Out of leaves.Damn. I love Him not.Take another flower and try again.Eventually you will be a purple crocodile.At least according to what the jojo`s are saying. Given enough tries everything is possible.Or they like to refer to it as choices.Probably my biggest mistake. Giving you humans free will, choice.You weren't ready for that. But the apes were. And all other creatures on the planet. How could I have missed that. You don't get to have a thumb AND free will.Before you know it you think you are god.Ooh. Hurt your feelings now huh. Good. You shouldn't have killed my son.I am still angry.MESSENGERDid I mention my other messenger, John Lennon.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10.Killed him too huh. Pretty insane. The killing, not John.John obviously was right. Instead of doing what was told, you morons created religions.Putting the messengers on pedestals, instead of yourselves.You get to climb a pedestal because of your actions, not because of your believes.Please do what John said. Stop going to someone elses church and be a pastor of your own church.You don't want me to get medieval on your ass.(Sorry, couldn't help it. Best phrase ever, from best movie ever)And I can, you know. It's just the counting my father tought me, what's holding me back.Did you notice something in my writing. Seems that the paragraphs get shorter and shorter.Running out of ideas. Out of time.Homework: watch 'Out of time'.MANY MUST DIE FOR A FEW TO LIVE FOREVERBest example is Adolf. Or is it Adolph. The absolute champion ofchampions. Dhengis was not bad. Stalin certainly lived up to expectations.The Bushes get a B for trying. But Adolph trumps them all by a landslide.He used jewish-German efficiency, technology and deception to exterminate the 'jewish' part. Leaving the world today filled with 'German' technology,and Germany as one of the strongest peoples / nations on this globe.No Darwinian will say it openly, but if you are a true Darwinian, Hitler is your god.Leads me to think, that part of the jews must have secretly listened to Jesus 2000 years ago,specifically to the turn-the-other-cheek part. Do you believe it. What are the odds.The only wrong thing my son said, and they had to follow that command, but the rest,which was right, they didn't follow.When someone hits you in the face, you hit him back twice, twice as hard, or you die trying.Homework for jews only: 'Inglorious Bastards'.Rest can watch too. Very amusing. Very true. Very natural. Very necessary.Fired my anti-dengue-spray. Killed at least seven mosquitos, after two failed attacks from their side. Still some hovering above me. See if can renew the mutual stand-down.Somehow I am not afraid anymore, now that I'm dying anyway. They attack. I kill them.No remorse. No second thoughts, like before.But still remorse over that first mosquito though. What has changed?It can't be Darwin. If it were him, I would be on a crusade, killing all mosquitoson the planet pre-emptively. Superiority? Then I would be feeling remorse for all of them.It must be that I adscribe huge intelligence to them. I consider them my peers.I know they have learned that I was remorseful, and willing to forgive the first mosquitofor not knowing. But now they know.And they know, that I know that they know.They know I was willing to share my blood so they could feed.They know they are infected by the virus, and that that's why I don't want them to sting me.They know the game is over.Yet, they attacked. And I evaded, defended and struck back. No remorse.I am superior. At least in this game.But I don't feel superior.That would be an insult to the mosquitos.I respect them.They are God's creatures.Here for a reason.Another Blitz. This one got me. Again.Time for medieval.WHAT`S MISSINGWhere is the audience? What is their role? Can there even be a game without an audience?Are they a player too? Who's side are they on?Can they do anything about the result?Will you stop?Life is not a game. There are no rules.Ofcourse a tree has just fallen over in a Finnish forest. And the cat is dead in the box.These facts don't change, whether you watch them or not. You are just not aware of them.I tried that, you know. I watched the tape of the final Holland-Germany over and over. Same resultevery time. No crocodile anywhere.Johan Cruijff said it. He could not understand why both teams were praying to win the game.The secret was different coloured socks. Shortlived though, because the other players soon picked up on that one.Quantum-jojo`s are out. Stand for something please. Make a choice.You can't throw us out. You created us. We are legitimate players. You inventedthis free-will thing. You even admitted it was a mistake. If You want to change the rules OK, butnot during the game. This neverending game...Got me there.No getting out of this one. Smart cookies. My image...Wait a minute.I am all powerful. Where is my spray.Better watch out. They might kill you. They are all-powerful too, being a copy.And they outnumber you.Come on. My own kids wouldn't kill me. Would they? Euthanasia? That's what they would use? Devious bastards.It might be jealousy that will overwhelm them. You are always sayingthat Jesus is your only son. That's a slap in the face. And you just said that if someone slaps you...Yeah. Might be better to retire. Alzheimer is getting to me.Bring on Greg to figure out why I am losing.DIAGNOSYSClearly you suffer from mirror syndrome. You are trying to be me.Can't be done. However I must say you are doing a great job.But Greg, I created you. Am I such a lousy actor that I can't even mimic my own creation,my own son? That`s the mirror problem dad. You are always gonna be one step behind or one stepahead. You can mimic me to near perfection, but the audience will always know who`s copying who.Is there a cure Greg? Can you fix me?Sorry dad. No cure. Only one Dr. House, and he is retired; or dead.But I miss you.Can't I create the new and improved Dr. House.I want to revive you.Promise me you won't be mad.Are you insane. You want to take me off my pedestal?I earned it. I will be mad at you. I will deny you!That doesn't scare me. Deny me all you want. But I don't want you to be mad at me,so I will find someone else to mirror. I can get the occasional consult, yes?OK. But it will not be very interesting. We have our diagnosys.Maybe if you could contract some outerspace disease. I have one for you Greg. I seem to be expanding all the time. You know, growing bigger and bigger.But my mass stays the same. It`s like I am a balloon being inflated by nothingness, by empty space.And I have no skin.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------indiegogo allows up to 60.000 characters.

</div> <p>Hi! We're Lucky Bastard Press, a small press with big ideas based in Oakland, California. This year we're publishing HYSTERIA, an anthology of writing female and nonbinary writers about their biology and anatomy and experiences with the body. No ovary will be left unturned. We're approaching everything from tampons to hysterectomies, eating disorders to gender identity, old traditions, rude awakenings, and moments of sheer pleasure. In our pages, you'll find stories of faith, race, pride and shame. Stories of the doctor's office and the dance floor, the bedroom, the bathroom, the stage and the study. </p>
<p>We cast our net far and wide to gather writing from an array of authors as diverse and varied as the human-bodied experience. We wanted to talk about bodies from every ethnic background possible. We wanted queer bodies and straight bodies. Cis bodies and trans* bodies. Bodies of different classes and countries. We wanted to hear about old bodies and new bodies, sick bodies and healthy bodies. Bodies that made babies and bodies that hadn't/wouldn't/couldn't. </p>
<p>We also wanted lots of different styles, so in HYSTERIA you'll find slam poetry, prose poetry, lyric essays, formal verse, free verse, microficion, fantasy, myth, legend and your back yard.</p>
<p>Contributors include award-winning established authors as well as some emerging writers we love and know you will love as well. Just to whet your appetite, here are some writers you'll get to read work from in HYSTERIA:</p>
<p><b>Rita Dove</b>, U.S. Poet Laureate (1993-1995) &amp; Pulitzer Winner <br/><b>Natasha Trethewey</b>, U.S. Poet Laureate (2012) &amp; Pulitzer Winner <br/><b>Patricia Smith</b>, Four-time National Poetry Slam Champion &amp; National Book Award Finalist <br/><b>Judith Ortiz Cofer</b>, O. Henry Prize winner &amp; Pushcart Prize Winner<br/><b>Lesléa Newman</b>, Two-time Stonewall Honor author <br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>Amy King</b>, Executive Board Member for VIDA: Women in Literary Arts<br/><b>Bri Blue</b>, Two-time Best Spoken Word Artist of the Year <br/><b>Francecsa Lia Block</b>, Lambda Literary Award Winner  &amp; Stonewall Book Award Winner <br/><b>Alison Joseph</b>, Academy of American Poets Prize Winner &amp; Associated Writing Programs Prize Winner</span></p>
<p>You'll also see work from such luminaries as Dorothea Lasky, Kelli Russell Agodon, Paula Mendoza, Amber Flame, M. Mack, Lynn Melnick, Randon Billings Noble, Erika Wurth, Eman Hassan, Christine Heppermann, Kate Litterer, Dena Rash Guzman, Allison Townsend, Sheila Squillante, Minal Hajratwala, Kia Groom, Ivy Alvarez, and Gayle Brandeis.</p>
<p>Many of our contributors have had work in such acclaimed annual anthologies as <i>Best American Poetry</i>, <i>The Pushcart Prize Anthology</i>, <i>Best American Essays</i>, and <i>Best of the Net</i>. They've appeared in all kinds of magazines, including these familiar rags: <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Paris Review</i>, <i>Salon</i>, <i>The Rumpus</i>, <i>Tin House</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>The Sun</i>, <i>Boston Review</i>, and even <i>O Magazine</i>. </p>

<div><i>We are raising $20K for research and development to pay for:</i></div>

<li>Magazine mock-up design and protype</li>

<div><b>WHAT MAKES THIS TIME DIFFERENT?</b></div>
<div>When we founded this award-winning magazine in 1993, we were just two urban women trying to make a difference. We thought if we funded it ourselves the money would come. And it did, in the form of advertisers but they came a bit too late. We didn't know any investors and we didn't have much collateral. There wasn't such a thing as crowdfunding or Twitter to get the word out. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Today is a new day. We have the resources to let others see the quality of what we're doing, that this publication has a need, and a place in the market. We've learned that we must start with research and development.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>That's where you come in. Your contribution allows for us to start the process. We are raising $20K in 39 days for research, which will included legal filings, and use the online platform as part of the development. We know the more engaged followers we have, the more advertisers will be attracted to Successful Black Parenting.</div>

""This magazine is long overdue. The cultures [Black and White] are so different, so it's hard for me to listen to non-African-Americans on parenting skills.""  -- S. Cobbs, Argonne, IL

""Thank you for coming out with a magazine on Black parenting!"" -- Ms. Jackson, Philadelphia, PA
A Parent's Perspective

We celebrate families. We celebrate differences and it's okay.



HARDLY ANY PARENTING MAGAZINE COVERS FEATURE BLACK CHILDREN
In 1993, we looked at 60 different parenting magazine covers and not one of them featured a child or parent of color, except for one that showed a mixed-race child. Barely one-out-of-60! 
Has it gotten better. No, not really. You can find a few covers here and there with images of Black children but what makes us different is that we decided to make a magazine that wasn't just a whitewashed version of a mainstream parenting magazine but to infuse it with culture.




IT'S IMPORTANT BLACK CHILDREN SEE THEMSELVES IN MEDIA TOO
Just as seeing positive body images is for young girls, it is just as important for young Black children to see themselves in mainstream media. If fosters positive self-esteem and good citizenship. 


""You can't be what you can't see,"" therefore it's important for children and parents to see themselves reflected in positive, successful images. - Janice Celeste, Editor-in-Chief

But it more than just about images, it's about culture and how we parent. To name a few, there are differences from dealing with specific health issues affecting the black community to Black hair care, which is neglected in mainstream parenting magazine articles.


It's important to us to show talk about these differences and show positive images of the Black family.




OH WE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE
Successful Black Parenting magazine was founded by an early childhood educator with a masters degree in business and is a faculty member in higher education/research scientist with a PhD in Culture, Curriculum and Change from the School of Education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

We've published this magazine before the Internet existed, before email was a thing, before there was crowdfunding and since then we've gotten advanced degrees, training in research and journalism, multimedia expertise, including photography and videography and web programming experience. We're ready!

RAISING $20K TO RAISE A VILLAGE
Times have changed, so we have some research to do to see what our audience wants and needs, and we must find out how best to serve them.

We are raising $20K for research and development to pay for:

Magazine mock-up design and protype
Design and production of the media kit
Target audience development
Content marketing research
Social media development
Photography/illustrations for online website
Legal filings to make sure we're legit


WHAT MAKES THIS TIME DIFFERENT?
When we founded this award-winning magazine in 1993, we were just two urban women trying to make a difference. We thought if we funded it ourselves the money would come. And it did, in the form of advertisers but they came a bit too late. We didn't know any investors and we didn't have much collateral. There wasn't such a thing as crowdfunding or Twitter to get the word out. 

Today is a new day. We have the resources to let others see the quality of what we're doing, that this publication has a need, and a place in the market. We've learned that we must start with research and development.

That's where you come in. Your contribution allows for us to start the process. We are raising $20K in 39 days for research, which will included legal filings, and use the online platform as part of the development. We know the more engaged followers we have, the more advertisers will be attracted to Successful Black Parenting.


Speaking of engaged followers, do you follow us on Twitter?

SO, THANK YOU, INDIEGOGO!</p><p><b>MY STORY &amp; THE EBOOK</b></p><p>Growing up on kaiju (Japanese giant monster) movies, I used to dream of crazy battles and wild scenes of mayhem and fun. As an adult living in Japan, I have gained a more in-depth appreciation of the genre through renting old DVDs of those movies in the original.</p><p>With the recent revitalization of the Godzilla franchise by Toho, I was struck by the unique opportunity as a Bizarro sexploitation author to have a bit of fun with the beloved characters of my childhood.</p><p>Rodzilla Respurgence is a knockoff parody in the tradition of crazy fun that doesn't take itself very seriously. It features ""familiar"" kaiju duking it out in bouts of flame throwing, grappling, body slams, and more as they battle for dominance of Zipang Island, a tropical paradise in the South Seas. The winners of which... well, go on to ""enjoy"" their victories.</p><p>This is, at its heart, an adult ebook with mature situations intended for such audiences. (The image above is the final cover.)</p><p>The ebook is currently being written (now at 9000 words, about 25 Word document pages), and will finished in the next few weeks, barring our home in Japan is not stomped on by mutant lizards from the depths off the coastal waters.</p><p>At the basic level (a reduced price of what I will be selling it for on Amazon), your money will get you... one copy of <b>Rodzilla Respurgence</b> in your favorite ebook format (mobi/Kindle, epub, PDF). DRM-Free! And possibly other ebooks if you go for the higher contribution levels.</p><p>Throughout the campaign, I will be posting word count updates and links to battles or scenes that do not contain adult material (as such links would violate IndieGogo terms, if I remember correctly) in an effort to keep funders informed of progress.

The ebook will be published and you will get your product regardless of how many contributors there are. Please back this project without worry! Thanks!WHY AM I ON INDIEGOGO AND NOT ANOTHER CROWDFUNDING PLATFORM?Quite simply put, I'm an American living in Japan (18 years this year), I have a Japanese credit card, but not a US credit card (but have US bank acct), and thus, I am not allowed to create fundraising campaigns on other platforms. SO, THANK YOU, INDIEGOGO!MY STORY & THE EBOOKGrowing up on kaiju (Japanese giant monster) movies, I used to dream of crazy battles and wild scenes of mayhem and fun. As an adult living in Japan, I have gained a more in-depth appreciation of the genre through renting old DVDs of those movies in the original.With the recent revitalization of the Godzilla franchise by Toho, I was struck by the unique opportunity as a Bizarro sexploitation author to have a bit of fun with the beloved characters of my childhood.Rodzilla Respurgence is a knockoff parody in the tradition of crazy fun that doesn't take itself very seriously. It features ""familiar"" kaiju duking it out in bouts of flame throwing, grappling, body slams, and more as they battle for dominance of Zipang Island, a tropical paradise in the South Seas. The winners of which... well, go on to ""enjoy"" their victories.This is, at its heart, an adult ebook with mature situations intended for such audiences. (The image above is the final cover.)The ebook is currently being written (now at 9000 words, about 25 Word document pages), and will finished in the next few weeks, barring our home in Japan is not stomped on by mutant lizards from the depths off the coastal waters.At the basic level (a reduced price of what I will be selling it for on Amazon), your money will get you... one copy of Rodzilla Respurgence in your favorite ebook format (mobi/Kindle, epub, PDF). DRM-Free! And possibly other ebooks if you go for the higher contribution levels.Throughout the campaign, I will be posting word count updates and links to battles or scenes that do not contain adult material (as such links would violate IndieGogo terms, if I remember correctly) in an effort to keep funders informed of progress. So I hope you will join me on this wild and crazy adventure of smut and battling kaiju in a lead up to one of the most anticipated monster movies this decade.And if you can't, or don't have the money on hand at the moment, you can always help spread the word via social media, blogs, and word of mouth.Whichever way you go, I thank you for your support!WHO AM I?Going by the pen name Made in DNA, I'm a short story author.

through literacy.

dream is to get a master degree, and as soon as I make a living, I will help
building a school for the childrens of my village where I was born and will arrange a qualified staff for
them. It is a promise I made to myself.
In
the meantime, I want your help to create and illustrate a series of books
for children in Urdu and in English.

books is to write stories that have charm, but also a morality lesson. I have
two books done in the English version so far. I write under the name Muhammad Asim.

About the Book</strong></h3><p>“If I had influence with the good fairy who is supposed to preside over the christening of all children, I should ask that her gift to each child in the world be a sense of wonder so indestructible that it would last throughout life, as an unfailing antidote to boredom and disenchantments of later years, the sterile preoccupation with things that are artificial, the alienation from the sources of our strength.”  Rachel Carson </p><p>Children are born with the gift of wonder described by Rachel Carson. A key to parenting and to teaching is to work with this natural, inborn sense of wonder. </p><p>During the primary school years the innocent, imaginative wonder of the six year old transforms year by year into the reality centered engagement of the preadolescent. </p><p>“To first graders, every object, every living being has a place in a world strung together by imagination. But, soon, an acorn top would cease to be an elf’s cap. A little stone would no longer be a fairy’s smooth, rounded seat. It would become a hard, lifeless rock. And the stars of the night sky would no longer dance with the fireflies, but would turn out to be cold, distant specks. Ultimately, by third grade, my students would each perceive themselves to be in a world of discrete objects, and they would see themselves standing apart from a universe that was no longer a never-ending, benign continuity.  </p><p>Then holding a steady course toward wonder would mean that I needed to become a different kind of teacher. It would be my job to help my students forge new connections with the universe one acorn, one stone, one star at a time. Then I would explain how the amazing phenomenon of photosynthesis leads to the production of acorns. I would describe the volcanic fire and flows of lava that gave birth to the igneous rock. I would bring my students close to the nuclear reactions in the far off stars and tell them that the atoms in their own bones were formed in an ancient stellar blaze. It would be a new sort of reality-based awe that I would need to learn how to kindle when my class ceased to make their own easy connections and understandings.”  from <i>A Gift of Wonder.</i></p><p><i>A Gift of Wonder,  A True Story Showing School As It Should Be,</i> invites readers into our classroom as my students and I travel from grades one through six in an independent school that, according to its philosophy statement, “cultivates in the children a feeling of wonder.”</p><p>Here the curriculum was based on the developmental stages of childhood and, according to an early reader, “one of the joys of this memoir is to see how children change at different ages.” A key to raising happy, inquisitive, adaptable children at home and at school is understanding the needs of children at each age level. <i>A Gift of Wonder</i> travels through the territory of childhood leaving readers with an understanding that will help in parenting or teaching.   </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497033413/bkyaskvl2e06tpzotfhd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2>A Remarkable Journey</h2><p><i>A Gift of Wonder, A True Story About School As It Could Be </i>is a journey into the heart of teaching, into the deepest questions we must ask ourselves as prepare children for the future. </p><p>Looking back over my  journey with my first class, I saw that our best classroom experiences would be disallowed in most public schools today. I wanted to write this story so that parents, teachers, and  leaders involved in making decisions about the future of education could see what has been discarded in the latest version of education reforms that have focused on testing rather than teaching, on narrow curriculum goals rather than meeting the complex needs of each individual.   </p><p><i>A Gift of Wonder</i> shows the baby that has been thrown out with the bathwater. </p><p>Most books about education offer a prescription, a carefully thought out methodology. Instead, I offer a story, a tale where children offer astounding insights, enter into productive arguments, and identify with characters from history.

In contrast, creative professions are best understood through stories.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497034945/aimmkfgq9fvdgfqqlcpl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p><p>As a teacher who teaches through stories, it was natural for me to use my own story as a way to help people envision education in which students are eager to go to school every day. </p><p>My teaching story begins in my first year in the classroom. I am the first to admit that I was inexperienced and often felt a bit lost. <i>A Gift of Wonder</i> shows me tentatively finding my way through the stages of childhood, seeking ways to help children with their individual challenges. And, it shows the reverence, love and humor I found as I witnessed these young people maturing in my care. Along the way there is a lost kitten, a health crisis, an argument over chewed up pencil, a howl in the night, an invisible spider’s web, and a hilarious student observation about frogs.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497146586/cfhorlmoka8prwwfvbfn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>2. Reviews </h3><p>A GIFT OF WONDER by Kim Allsup is a book about teaching and about being a teacher, but it is also a book with deep, real lessons of life, learning, and the wonder of children. It is transcendent and funny and rich with experience, and I only wish I could have had a teacher like Kim Allsup. Reading her book is the next best thing.  </p><p>Brent Runyon Author of The Burn Journals </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">""Allsup develops the mood and after-images of her book in a way that weaves an unusually lovely cloak for us to see –– rather, a magic cloak that gives us a new perception of childhood, teaching, and education.""   from the foreword by Patrice Maynard </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497035317/fsvekjm06r6lmgwvwjxd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>“In a world that tends to tell us all what to buy, what to feel, what to do, how to do it, and what to think about, Allsup’s story of a class with children who are left free to have their own experiences and express what they have discovered on their own is refreshing and moving.”  from the foreword by  Patrice Maynard, Director of Publications and Development for the Research Institute for Waldorf Education </p><p>“What qualities and skills will enable the next few generations to meet their challenges? First, they will have to have the self-understanding to be able to discern truth from falsehood, and the self-esteem to be able to open to the truth. Second, they will have to possess the imagination to envision and develop solutions to the problems. And, finally, they’ll have to be able to lead others to effect their solutions.</p><p>Self-understanding and self-esteem are the cornerstones. How do you teach self-understanding and self-esteem? Surprisingly, the answer is neither new nor complicated. First, teachers must model wonder, such that their students feel affirmed for their natural tendency to wonder. And, second, the teachers must listen to their students without bias, such that the children feel invited and free to share their perceptions and interpretations, which is to say, to self-create. The instant an individual takes responsibility for creating the life she wishes to lead, she also begins to take responsibility for creating the world in which she can lead it."" Robert Leaver, retired headmaster </p><h3><strong> 3. Why A Gift of Wonder is important </strong></h3><p>Today teachers are leaving public education in the United States in record numbers because rigid rules prevent them from creative, authentic teaching. One such teacher, David Xirau, penned this letter upon leaving public school teaching in Massachusetts in 2015</p><p>""Authentic teaching is done free of the restrictive standards, unattainable objectives, and insanely burdensome administrative minutiae that are imposed upon us every day. ...</p><p>What is the real cost of this extra work? Who is paying the price when our minds and energy are devoted to endless testing, development of standards and objectives, rubrics, measurement, results, analysis, DDMs, improvement plans, PLCs, ""Smart"" goals, evidence collecting, percentages, alignments, core curriculum, cross curriculum, accommodations, modifications, incessant IEP paperwork, meetings, data, data, data, and more data? Read the list again!! Where is the pedagogy? When do we get to teach?</p><p>Students need to be taught, not analyzed. They are human beings, not an experiment, not parts of a machine coming off of an assembly line. My students need and deserve my full attention, something I cannot give under the current circumstances."" </p><p>Recently two researchers, Mehta and Fine, discovered that, in spite of the rigid rules that govern many educators, there are teachers in most schools whose students are especially engaged and motivated. The researchers noticed that these public school teachers often bend the rules, are not afraid to go off script, that they sometimes allow the students to lead the class and that they see their students as their teachers. </p><p>While teachers in many schools would be be stretching the rules to go off script, I taught in a Waldorf school where teachers are encouraged to create lessons that are tailored to their students and to spontaneously change plans to meet the needs of their students. <i>A Gift of Wonder </i>shows this creative freedom.</p><p><i>A Gift of Wonder</i> reveals the secret behind the academic successes and life satisfaction reported by both students and teachers in Waldorf schools worldwide. This secret cannot be found in novel reading programs, the latest math text or a new teaching methodology. Rather, the key to nurturing highly motivated students is simple: trust the judgement of creative professionals to know when to let go of the lesson plan, when to encourage an off topic discussion, when to substitute a more relevant presentation and when to let the students lead the way.  </p><h2>4.  How you can help and why your suport is vital</h2><p><i>A Gift of Wonder </i> will be released by Lindisfarne Press on August 15, 2017. This means all of the work to create the book (writing, editing, design, layout and cover) has been accomplished. While many crowdfunding campaigns to support books seek funds to finish an incomplete project, <i>A Gift of Wonder</i>  has been brought to the publication stage without outside support.  </p><p>Your help is needed to take the last, big step -- finding readers. </p><p>it is easy to help by sharing this campaign on social media and telling your friends about the <i>A Gift of Wonder</i>.</p><p>I would so appreciate for review  on Amazon, Goodreads and other sites. </p><p>Please be among the first readers of <i>A Gift of Wonder.</i> Your purchase of the book through this campaign and your donations to the campaign will fund a professional publicist and advertising.</p><p>Children's experience at school can be wondrous. <i>A Gift of Wonder </i>can help create the paradigm shift that our children need and deserve, but this vision of schooling will reach its potential as a force for change only if readers find it.  Please help <i>A Gift of Wonder</i> find its readers.

And the stars of the night sky would no longer dance with the fireflies, but would turn out to be cold, distant specks. Ultimately, by third grade, my students would each perceive themselves to be in a world of discrete objects, and they would see themselves standing apart from a universe that was no longer a never-ending, benign continuity.  Then holding a steady course toward wonder would mean that I needed to become a different kind of teacher. It would be my job to help my students forge new connections with the universe one acorn, one stone, one star at a time. Then I would explain how the amazing phenomenon of photosynthesis leads to the production of acorns. I would describe the volcanic fire and flows of lava that gave birth to the igneous rock. I would bring my students close to the nuclear reactions in the far off stars and tell them that the atoms in their own bones were formed in an ancient stellar blaze. It would be a new sort of reality-based awe that I would need to learn how to kindle when my class ceased to make their own easy connections and understandings.”  from A Gift of Wonder.A Gift of Wonder,  A True Story Showing School As It Should Be, invites readers into our classroom as my students and I travel from grades one through six in an independent school that, according to its philosophy statement, “cultivates in the children a feeling of wonder.”Here the curriculum was based on the developmental stages of childhood and, according to an early reader, “one of the joys of this memoir is to see how children change at different ages.” A key to raising happy, inquisitive, adaptable children at home and at school is understanding the needs of children at each age level. A Gift of Wonder travels through the territory of childhood leaving readers with an understanding that will help in parenting or teaching.    A Remarkable JourneyA Gift of Wonder, A True Story About School As It Could Be is a journey into the heart of teaching, into the deepest questions we must ask ourselves as prepare children for the future. Looking back over my  journey with my first class, I saw that our best classroom experiences would be disallowed in most public schools today. I wanted to write this story so that parents, teachers, and  leaders involved in making decisions about the future of education could see what has been discarded in the latest version of education reforms that have focused on testing rather than teaching, on narrow curriculum goals rather than meeting the complex needs of each individual.   A Gift of Wonder shows the baby that has been thrown out with the bathwater. Most books about education offer a prescription, a carefully thought out methodology. Instead, I offer a story, a tale where children offer astounding insights, enter into productive arguments, and identify with characters from history. Above all, A Gift of Wonder shows the relationships among a teacher and her students in which a teacher models attention and listening by tuning in to her students.  The Power of StoriesAs Ken Robinson says, ""Teaching is a creative profession, not a delivery system.”Delivery systems can be packaged, managed and, above all, standardized and tested. In contrast, creative professions are best understood through stories. As a teacher who teaches through stories, it was natural for me to use my own story as a way to help people envision education in which students are eager to go to school every day. My teaching story begins in my first year in the classroom. I am the first to admit that I was inexperienced and often felt a bit lost. A Gift of Wonder shows me tentatively finding my way through the stages of childhood, seeking ways to help children with their individual challenges. And, it shows the reverence, love and humor I found as I witnessed these young people maturing in my care. Along the way there is a lost kitten, a health crisis, an argument over chewed up pencil, a howl in the night, an invisible spider’s web, and a hilarious student observation about frogs.   2. Reviews A GIFT OF WONDER by Kim Allsup is a book about teaching and about being a teacher, but it is also a book with deep, real lessons of life, learning, and the wonder of children. It is transcendent and funny and rich with experience, and I only wish I could have had a teacher like Kim Allsup. Reading her book is the next best thing.  Brent Runyon Author of The Burn Journals ""Allsup develops the mood and after-images of her book in a way that weaves an unusually lovely cloak for us to see –– rather, a magic cloak that gives us a new perception of childhood, teaching, and education.""   from the foreword by Patrice Maynard “In a world that tends to tell us all what to buy, what to feel, what to do, how to do it, and what to think about, Allsup’s story of a class with children who are left free to have their own experiences and express what they have discovered on their own is refreshing and moving.”  from the foreword by  Patrice Maynard, Director of Publications and Development for the Research Institute for Waldorf Education “What qualities and skills will enable the next few generations to meet their challenges? First, they will have to have the self-understanding to be able to discern truth from falsehood, and the self-esteem to be able to open to the truth. Second, they will have to possess the imagination to envision and develop solutions to the problems. And, finally, they’ll have to be able to lead others to effect their solutions.Self-understanding and self-esteem are the cornerstones. How do you teach self-understanding and self-esteem? Surprisingly, the answer is neither new nor complicated. First, teachers must model wonder, such that their students feel affirmed for their natural tendency to wonder. And, second, the teachers must listen to their students without bias, such that the children feel invited and free to share their perceptions and interpretations, which is to say, to self-create. The instant an individual takes responsibility for creating the life she wishes to lead, she also begins to take responsibility for creating the world in which she can lead it."" Robert Leaver, retired headmaster  3. Why A Gift of Wonder is important Today teachers are leaving public education in the United States in record numbers because rigid rules prevent them from creative, authentic teaching. One such teacher, David Xirau, penned this letter upon leaving public school teaching in Massachusetts in 2015""Authentic teaching is done free of the restrictive standards, unattainable objectives, and insanely burdensome administrative minutiae that are imposed upon us every day. ...What is the real cost of this extra work? Who is paying the price when our minds and energy are devoted to endless testing, development of standards and objectives, rubrics, measurement, results, analysis, DDMs, improvement plans, PLCs, ""Smart"" goals, evidence collecting, percentages, alignments, core curriculum, cross curriculum, accommodations, modifications, incessant IEP paperwork, meetings, data, data, data, and more data? Read the list again!! Where is the pedagogy? When do we get to teach?Students need to be taught, not analyzed. They are human beings, not an experiment, not parts of a machine coming off of an assembly line. My students need and deserve my full attention, something I cannot give under the current circumstances."" Recently two researchers, Mehta and Fine, discovered that, in spite of the rigid rules that govern many educators, there are teachers in most schools whose students are especially engaged and motivated. The researchers noticed that these public school teachers often bend the rules, are not afraid to go off script, that they sometimes allow the students to lead the class and that they see their students as their teachers. While teachers in many schools would be be stretching the rules to go off script, I taught in a Waldorf school where teachers are encouraged to create lessons that are tailored to their students and to spontaneously change plans to meet the needs of their students. A Gift of Wonder shows this creative freedom.A Gift of Wonder reveals the secret behind the academic successes and life satisfaction reported by both students and teachers in Waldorf schools worldwide. This secret cannot be found in novel reading programs, the latest math text or a new teaching methodology. Rather, the key to nurturing highly motivated students is simple: trust the judgement of creative professionals to know when to let go of the lesson plan, when to encourage an off topic discussion, when to substitute a more relevant presentation and when to let the students lead the way.  4.  How you can help and why your suport is vitalA Gift of Wonder  will be released by Lindisfarne Press on August 15, 2017. This means all of the work to create the book (writing, editing, design, layout and cover) has been accomplished. While many crowdfunding campaigns to support books seek funds to finish an incomplete project, A Gift of Wonder  has been brought to the publication stage without outside support.  Your help is needed to take the last, big step -- finding readers. it is easy to help by sharing this campaign on social media and telling your friends about the A Gift of Wonder.I would so appreciate for review  on Amazon, Goodreads and other sites. Please be among the first readers of A Gift of Wonder. Your purchase of the book through this campaign and your donations to the campaign will fund a professional publicist and advertising.Children's experience at school can be wondrous. A Gift of Wonder can help create the paradigm shift that our children need and deserve, but this vision of schooling will reach its potential as a force for change only if readers find it.  Please help A Gift of Wonder find its readers. On behalf of the children of tomorrow, I thank you for being part of this mission to support a vision of the healthy blossoming of children at school.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Making The Case for the NEA and NEH</h3>
<p>President Donald Trump stands ready to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), those two grand old battleships which have supported a broad range of arts and humanities projects since 1965. The combined 2016 budget of the NEA and NEH stood at just $296 million in 2016 – a mere fraction (to be precise, .003 %) of the $3.8 trillion federal budget, the latter incorporating more than $600 billion in military spending.</p>
<p>Although cutting funds to the NEA and NEH won't make the slightest difference when it comes to balancing the federal budget, it will make an enormous – in many ways, <i>crippling</i> – difference when it comes to many vital cultural institutions.</p>
<p>My friend Claiborne Pell – then Senator from my adopted home state of Rhode Island – was the principal sponsor of the bill which created the NEA and NEH in 1965. It is with Clai in mind that I am now writing, on a fast schedule, a full history of the NEA and NEH since their founding. The book is to be a chronicle of how much has been achieved and created which would not have ever existed had the NEA and NEH not been there to provide support.</p>
<p><i>The book will include testimonials from artists and scholars at instiutions and organizations large and small for whom NEA and NEH funding has proved vital to the origination of truly great work.</i></p>
<p>When the book is done, I will have 100 copies earmarked as gifts for each and every member of the Senate. This is what the $1000 is for. Any additional sum raised will be used  for free distribution to policy makers beyond the Senate. I will also make the eBook edition available for free download to anyone who might wish to read the text (and hopefully redistribute it to friends, colleagues, and local political leaders).</p>
<p>The need is urgent. Time is of the essence. I intend to have the book out by the end of May.</p>
<p>I'll be dedicating the book to the memory of Claiborne and Nuala Pell.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>My Credentials</h2>
<p>I am the author of numerous books including <i>The Kennedys at War</i> (Doubleday), <i>Dark Genius of Wall Street</i> (Basic), <i>The Secret Six</i> (Crown), and <i>The Lion's Pride</i> (Oxford University Press). I am also the proprietor of a [very] small publishing company, New Street Communications, through which I shall publish the NEA/NEH book. Additionally, I have written for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, Hearst's <i>Veranda</i>, and other publications.</p>

President Donald Trump stands ready to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), those two grand old battleships which have supported a broad range of arts and humanities projects since 1965. The combined 2016 budget of the NEA and NEH stood at just $296 million in 2016 – a mere fraction (to be precise, .003 %) of the $3.8 trillion federal budget, the latter incorporating more than $600 billion in military spending.
Although cutting funds to the NEA and NEH won't make the slightest difference when it comes to balancing the federal budget, it will make an enormous – in many ways, crippling – difference when it comes to many vital cultural institutions.
My friend Claiborne Pell – then Senator from my adopted home state of Rhode Island – was the principal sponsor of the bill which created the NEA and NEH in 1965. It is with Clai in mind that I am now writing, on a fast schedule, a full history of the NEA and NEH since their founding. The book is to be a chronicle of how much has been achieved and created which would not have ever existed had the NEA and NEH not been there to provide support.
The book will include testimonials from artists and scholars at instiutions and organizations large and small for whom NEA and NEH funding has proved vital to the origination of truly great work.
When the book is done, I will have 100 copies earmarked as gifts for each and every member of the Senate. This is what the $1000 is for. Any additional sum raised will be used  for free distribution to policy makers beyond the Senate. I will also make the eBook edition available for free download to anyone who might wish to read the text (and hopefully redistribute it to friends, colleagues, and local political leaders).
The need is urgent. Time is of the essence. I intend to have the book out by the end of May.
I'll be dedicating the book to the memory of Claiborne and Nuala Pell.
 
My Credentials
I am the author of numerous books including The Kennedys at War (Doubleday), Dark Genius of Wall Street (Basic), The Secret Six (Crown), and The Lion's Pride (Oxford University Press). I am also the proprietor of a [very] small publishing company, New Street Communications, through which I shall publish the NEA/NEH book. Additionally, I have written for the Wall Street Journal, the San Francisco Chronicle, Hearst's Veranda, and other publications.
 

What We Need & What You Get
Here are the rudiments:

I'm looking for $1000 to fund the distribution of 100 copies to members of the United States Senate.
There are some cool perks. Check 'em out.
Should we not reach the $1000 goal, we'll use whatever funds gained to distribute as as many copies of the book as possible.  ;-)


 
The Impact
Information is powerful. Truth is a hammer. There is no better argument for continued funding of the NEA and NEH than a full chronicle of these organizations' successes in providing indispensable funding to thousands of  crucial arts and humanities endeavors through the years.

 
Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>A Quick Look at the Accordion Babes</h3>
<p>This is a fun project to support if you have an accordion lover in your life or if the accordion is the love of your life. It's a 2019 calendar perfect for music rooms and music-themed homes. The photos are not just sexy, they are shot in a classic pin-up style which invites you to imagine the stories behind the images.  Each month of the calendar features an accordion and a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>There are clips of all the photos in the 2019 Accordion Babes Calendar in the campaign video so you can see how we portray ourselves in our pin-ups. You can also check out the thumbnail preview below. I went for a pink-haired, gritty superhero image this year. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531315394/gxgrjgswkmmejekqri3t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I've been a professional accordionist since 2001, playing everything from street shows to big festivals, solo and with bands. I love organizing this calendar because accordion has brought so much fun into my life and it feels good to spread the word that this instrument still thrives in the modern world. Publishing the Accordion Babes Pin-Up Calendar has brought me in touch with many talented indie musicians, who inspire me to keep working hard at bringing more art into the world.</p>
<p>This calendar is a much-needed splash of culture and fun in crazy times. Every month our pictures remind people that life is still beautiful and pretty amusing, too. In a world that just seems to care if women look thin, rich, and pretty, we provide an important inspiration and counter-example of what real sexiness is, and how it's connected to joy, bravery, art... and accordions.</p>
<p>The Accordion Babes CD has fun music, from ska to electronic, to jazz and folk, Cajun, blues, rock, tango, polka, Brazilian pop, a big variety of styles which you don't usually hear on the radio. The album has a bunch of great grooves which are ideal for workouts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Prizes</h3>
<p>You can get single calendars, or multiple calendars with a discount, or you can order a complete set of the 2010-2019 editions. There are also four advertising spots on the last page, where businesses can show their support... this type of sponsorship comes with ten free calendars.  For a smaller donation, you can get a poster of an Accordion Babe mailed to you from one of our back-issue calendars. We will give grateful shout-outs online to all of our backers, no donation is too small.</p>
<p>Social media shares are crucial to making this fundraiser work so don't feel bad if all you can give is a ""share"". The more people who share the campaign, in a short amount of time, the better our odds are at getting fully funded. Please post the link on your favorite social media platforms and accordion forums.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>We're aiming to print the 2019 Accordion Babes Calendar in early August. Costs to cover include: print cost of 1500 calendars, cost of 1500 CDs in white paper sleeves, fee for mastering the album, fee for graphics layout, taxes, postage, mailers, and wages for our mailing crew.</p>
<p>We need about $7000 for the print run and to cover the cost of mailing out the pre-ordered calendars. We need about $6,000 to cover the basic print cost.</p>
<p>If we are able to print the Accordion Babes 2019 calendar this summer, we are setting up for a wider distribution in record shops and bookstores in the fall. An August print date helps us spread our accordion-loving counter-culture message a lot farther. </p>
<p>If we fall short of our financial goal, the plan is to still go to press in August, with reduced volume if necessary. In that case, we will raise the rest of the mailing money with calendar pre-sales to individuals and shops.  The calendar delivery date is set for September to allow us the time to organize the mail and to raise the needed funds to cover all costs (if needed). This project has been on-going since 2008... before crowdfunding platforms became popular. We were able to fund the entire Accordion Babes print-run with advertising and pre-sales in the first six years of production so this back-up plan is a well-tested one. If this fundraiser is 100% funded, we'll ship out the prizes in mid-August when the calendars are hot off the press. We will also toast our backers and celebrate into the wee hours with grateful accordion tunes.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>About Angst:</h2><p>A lot of fantasy books are hero stories. Most of them are about young people with great power and potential but no direction. They meet an old wizard who sends them on a path to become a hero. Angst is the guy who got passed up for all of that. He's in his 40s, going through a midlife crisis, and knows the only way he can be happy is to be a hero - a knight in shining armor. This is a 'be careful what you wish for' story as Angst drags his reluctant friends on A Midlife Crisis in Medieval Times.</p><h3>About this series:</h3><p>Angst is a fantasy series for readers who enjoy good humor with relateable characters. Readers have posted over 250 reviews across <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/default/e/B004CYWK4E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazon</a> and <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4487680.David_J_Pedersen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Goodreads</a>, written songs, and created artwork based on this series. The final book in the Angst series will be published in 4th quarter of 2018.</p><h3>About the audiobook:</h3><p>Michael Troughton has agreed to be the narrator for Angst. Troughton’s acting career is impressive, appearing in over <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0873742"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">70 shows and movies</a>. He’s been an actor, writer, and teacher for over 35 years. Michael is also the son of Patrick Troughton, the 2nd Doctor Who. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTOnJD6H3IU"" width=""560""></iframe></div> <p></p><h3>About funding:</h3><p>Pre-ordering the audiobook, or any of the perks, is a great way to help fund production costs. Should funding go past goal, that money will be put towards producing the second Angst audiobook, <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Buried-Angst-David-Pedersen-ebook/dp/B00CXG1FX0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Buried in Angst</a>. By participating in this campaign, you are helping me fund the best narrator.</p><h3>About timing:</h3><p>Mr. Troughton plans on completing the Angst audiobook in December 2018.</p><h3>About Parkinson's:</h3><p>As many of you know, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in July 2017. Throughout the year, I've been donating a portion of my sales made at conventions to the Michael J. Fox Foundation. I truly believe they are working hard to come up with a cure, and honestly, I really want a cure. With that in mind, I will be donating 5% of every dollar received for this campaign to the <a href=""https://www.michaeljfox.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Michael J. Fox Foundation</a> for Parkinson's Research. By participating in my indiegogo, you will be helping me in more ways than one.</p><h3>About shipping:</h3><p>Ugh! When are we getting teleporters, really? Shipping anything, especially overseas, is not cheap. For large shipments of books, the United States cost is based on media rate. International rates are USPS ground. Unfortunately that means waiting up to 21 days. I intend to ship everything at once, which means that you may have to wait until the fifth book is complete. A lot of items, like shirts and hats, should ship well before deadline. Several perks are set for December 2018, but that's not definitive if it's a perk that includes book 5.

Most of them are about young people with great power and potential but no direction. They meet an old wizard who sends them on a path to become a hero. Angst is the guy who got passed up for all of that. He's in his 40s, going through a midlife crisis, and knows the only way he can be happy is to be a hero - a knight in shining armor. This is a 'be careful what you wish for' story as Angst drags his reluctant friends on A Midlife Crisis in Medieval Times.About this series:Angst is a fantasy series for readers who enjoy good humor with relateable characters. Readers have posted over 250 reviews across Amazon and Goodreads, written songs, and created artwork based on this series. The final book in the Angst series will be published in 4th quarter of 2018.About the audiobook:Michael Troughton has agreed to be the narrator for Angst. Troughton’s acting career is impressive, appearing in over 70 shows and movies. He’s been an actor, writer, and teacher for over 35 years. Michael is also the son of Patrick Troughton, the 2nd Doctor Who.  About funding:Pre-ordering the audiobook, or any of the perks, is a great way to help fund production costs. Should funding go past goal, that money will be put towards producing the second Angst audiobook, Buried in Angst. By participating in this campaign, you are helping me fund the best narrator.About timing:Mr. Troughton plans on completing the Angst audiobook in December 2018.About Parkinson's:As many of you know, I was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in July 2017. Throughout the year, I've been donating a portion of my sales made at conventions to the Michael J. Fox Foundation. I truly believe they are working hard to come up with a cure, and honestly, I really want a cure. With that in mind, I will be donating 5% of every dollar received for this campaign to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. By participating in my indiegogo, you will be helping me in more ways than one.About shipping:Ugh! When are we getting teleporters, really? Shipping anything, especially overseas, is not cheap. For large shipments of books, the United States cost is based on media rate. International rates are USPS ground. Unfortunately that means waiting up to 21 days. I intend to ship everything at once, which means that you may have to wait until the fifth book is complete. A lot of items, like shirts and hats, should ship well before deadline. Several perks are set for December 2018, but that's not definitive if it's a perk that includes book 5. If you prefer something faster, or a split shipment, please ask. (See the Contact me section below.)About downloadable content:The Angst audiobook will be made available via a link that you can access on your computer or gifted to you through Audible; Amazon ebooks will be gifted to you for your Kindle.  If you purchase physical copies of the audiobook, domestic shipping is included with your order.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Most people know me as <strong>Lucha</strong>. I have been living in several places throughout my life (UK, USA, Germany) and <strong>I have been fortunate to travel all around</strong>. Nowadays I<strong> work as translator/writer</strong>. I cannot put into words how much I love my job. </p>
<h3>What is this campaign about?</h3>
<p>Palestine (as well as  Syria) holds a special place in my heart, hence I have decided to <strong>volunteer with Project Hope in beautiful Nablus (Northern region of the West Bank) in the Occupied Territories of Palestine for two months</strong>. I will be teaching English in some schools and refugee camps. As well as I will be doing some other workshops to improve the kids education. </p>
<p><strong>Project Hope is a NGO that have a long history of providing education and a window to the outer world for Palestinian young adults and children </strong>that cannot travel, and that have suffered greatly specially so during the 2012 attacks. <strong>Due to Israel´s restrictions volunteers are not allowed into occupied Palestine and neither is school supplies and educational equipment</strong>. That is the main reason why through fundraising we are able to buy all that is necessary once we are there. I personally will be buying the school supplies with the help of the NGO to provide the tools for these children. </p>
<p>Here are the lists by Project Hope of some of the things they need:</p>

<p>Here you have the NGO´s link if you would like more information <a href=""http://projecthope.ps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://projecthope.ps/</a></p>
<p><strong>This is why I am asking you to help me raise the money to buy the educational equipment for the children and the schools. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Anything that you can possibly donate is of great help and you can also share this and help me out spreading the word. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Thank you! Mucho love!</strong></p>

<h3><strong>¿Quién soy?</strong></h3>
<p>Mucha gente me conoce como <strong>Lucha</strong>.  He vivido en distintos lugares durante mi vida (EEUU, Reino Unido, Alemania) y he tenido la gran fortuna de poder viajar sin parar. Trabajo como traductora/redactora. No puedo expresar con palabras lo mucho que disfruto de mi trabajo. Cuando no estoy trabajando o viajando, me dedico a llevar a cabo proyectos de voluntariado especialmente con niños. </p>
<h3>¿De qué trata esta campaña?</h3>
<p>Palestina (al igual que Siria) ocupa un lugar especial en mi corazón, <strong>es por ello que he decidido trabajar como voluntaria en Nablus (al norte de Cisjordania) en los Territorios Ocupados de Palestina, durante dos meses. Con la ONG Project Hope</strong>. Mi labor será la de dar <strong>clases de inglés, en colegios y campos de refugiados así como llevar a cabo otros talleres que fomenten el desarrollo y la educación de los chavales.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Project Hope es una ONG tiene una larga y reconocida historia en Cisjordania, y en toda Palestina por proporcionar no sólo educación a muchas chicas y chicos, si no también de ofrecerles una ventana cultural al mundo</strong>, puesto que ellos no pueden viajar. De ahí su importancia y más desde los ataques de 2012. <strong>Debido a las restricciones israelíes, los voluntarios y cooperantes no tienen acceso a Gaza y Cisjordania, y tampoco se puede transportar material escolar hasta estos puntos. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Es por esto que a través de campañas de recaudación de fondos, como ésta, se consigue el dinero para que una vez consiga llegar a Nablus, pueda con ayuda de Project Hope comprar todos los materiales didácticos necesarios.</strong> </p>
<p>Aquí os adjunto unas listas que PH ha puesto a disposición en su página web <a href=""http://projecthope.ps/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://projecthope.ps/</a></p>
<p>English Program Wish List: <a href=""http://amzn.com/w/3EJJ43V70YRGZ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://amzn.com/w/3EJJ43V70YRGZ</a></p>

<p>Art Program Wish List- <a href=""http://amzn.com/w/3TTBE9BY4LHV4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://amzn.com/w/3TTBE9BY4LHV</a></p>
<p>Por eso <strong>os pido vuestra ayuda con cualquier aportación, grande o pequeña, para poder ayudar a estos chicos, porque creo fehacientemente que la única forma de erradicar los conflictos con sus consabidos flujos de mareas humanas y crisis humanitarias; es a través de la EDUCACIÓN.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Podéis también  compartir en vuestras redes sociales esta campaña...y conseguir que más gente se una con un fin común. </strong></p>

Palestine (as well as  Syria) holds a special place in my heart, hence I have decided to volunteer with Project Hope in beautiful Nablus (Northern region of the West Bank) in the Occupied Territories of Palestine for two months. I will be teaching English in some schools and refugee camps. As well as I will be doing some other workshops to improve the kids education. 
Project Hope is a NGO that have a long history of providing education and a window to the outer world for Palestinian young adults and children that cannot travel, and that have suffered greatly specially so during the 2012 attacks. Due to Israel´s restrictions volunteers are not allowed into occupied Palestine and neither is school supplies and educational equipment. That is the main reason why through fundraising we are able to buy all that is necessary once we are there. I personally will be buying the school supplies with the help of the NGO to provide the tools for these children. 
Here are the lists by Project Hope of some of the things they need:

French Program Wish List- http://amzn.com/w/7TNFYR8I727F
Art Program Wish List- http://amzn.com/w/3TTBE9BY4LHV
Here you have the NGO´s link if you would like more information http://projecthope.ps/
This is why I am asking you to help me raise the money to buy the educational equipment for the children and the schools. 
Anything that you can possibly donate is of great help and you can also share this and help me out spreading the word. 
 
Thank you! Mucho love!
Lucia
¿Quién soy?
Mucha gente me conoce como Lucha.  He vivido en distintos lugares durante mi vida (EEUU, Reino Unido, Alemania) y he tenido la gran fortuna de poder viajar sin parar. Trabajo como traductora/redactora. No puedo expresar con palabras lo mucho que disfruto de mi trabajo. Cuando no estoy trabajando o viajando, me dedico a llevar a cabo proyectos de voluntariado especialmente con niños. 
¿De qué trata esta campaña?
Palestina (al igual que Siria) ocupa un lugar especial en mi corazón, es por ello que he decidido trabajar como voluntaria en Nablus (al norte de Cisjordania) en los Territorios Ocupados de Palestina, durante dos meses. Con la ONG Project Hope. Mi labor será la de dar clases de inglés, en colegios y campos de refugiados así como llevar a cabo otros talleres que fomenten el desarrollo y la educación de los chavales. 
Project Hope es una ONG tiene una larga y reconocida historia en Cisjordania, y en toda Palestina por proporcionar no sólo educación a muchas chicas y chicos, si no también de ofrecerles una ventana cultural al mundo, puesto que ellos no pueden viajar. De ahí su importancia y más desde los ataques de 2012. Debido a las restricciones israelíes, los voluntarios y cooperantes no tienen acceso a Gaza y Cisjordania, y tampoco se puede transportar material escolar hasta estos puntos. 
Es por esto que a través de campañas de recaudación de fondos, como ésta, se consigue el dinero para que una vez consiga llegar a Nablus, pueda con ayuda de Project Hope comprar todos los materiales didácticos necesarios. 
Aquí os adjunto unas listas que PH ha puesto a disposición en su página web http://projecthope.ps/
English Program Wish List: http://amzn.com/w/3EJJ43V70YRGZ
French Program Wish List- http://amzn.com/w/7TNFYR8I727F
Art Program Wish List- http://amzn.com/w/3TTBE9BY4LHV
Por eso os pido vuestra ayuda con cualquier aportación, grande o pequeña, para poder ayudar a estos chicos, porque creo fehacientemente que la única forma de erradicar los conflictos con sus consabidos flujos de mareas humanas y crisis humanitarias; es a través de la EDUCACIÓN.
Podéis también  compartir en vuestras redes sociales esta campaña...y conseguir que más gente se una con un fin común. 

Os estoy eternamente agradecida.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Inspired by true events, 'The Memory of Chiffon' is a poignant story of discovery and loss, family and forgetting, mythical creatures and travel adventures. But mostly it is a story of recipes and love. </p>
<p>'The Memory of Chiffon' tells the story of Cate, whose personal life is in crisis. Recently divorced and having just lost her job, Cate decides to take her daughter, who believes in mythical creatures, and her mother who has Alzheimer's, on a journey to interesting and alluring countries around  the world, retracing a trip she took with her parents when she was a little girl. Along the way, Cate discovers her past and finds herself, through her adventures and her mother's old recipe books.</p>
<p>As an author, and having lost my mother to Alzheimers, writing 'The Memory of Chiffon' is going to be one of the most important things I will ever do in my life. It is a personal journey but also fictional tale of exploration, hope and the 'ugly-beautiful' that comes with living with someone with Alzheimers. And it's one I know I need to share - because while there is a lot of information about Alzheimer's disease out there, none of it really tell you how it feels. How it feels for you, the person whose mother has Alzheimer's. Or how it feels for her, the woman whose life has become a deeply disturbing and unfathomable place. A mother whose mind has become unrecognisable to her. None of them tell you what to do with those feelings. None of them tell you how harrowing Alzheimer's really is, how much time and patience it takes, how deeply it impacts the lives of everyone in a family. How heartbreakingly destructive it is.  </p>
<p>So thank you for sharing my writing and this experience with me. Your support will <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">help me help others who need hope in their journey to love and live with someone with </span><font>Alzheimers. </font></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>The pre-orders of the book that you make will help fund my research and writing process over the next 10 months, and give the book the distribution demand it requires to be taken up by a publishing house. By supporting this campaign, you will get the pre-release to the book before its official launch date. And you could even get involved in the novel by participating in choosing the name of a character.</p>
<p>As the campaign is based on pre-orders, the funding limit doesn't impact the success of the campaign. I will write this book, no matter what happens with this funding campaign - it just may take me a bit longer without the funding required for research and writing. But you can be assured that you will always get the rewards you choose, and I will keep you updated every step of the way!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Ways I Need Your Help</h3>
</div><div><p>Apart from the funding, 'The Memory of Chiffon' also needs awareness and support in so many other ways. So, I would really appreciate your help in sharing this campaign with your friends and family who love adventure, travel, baking - or anyone you know who loves someone who is suffering from Alzheimers - through this Indiegogo campaign, our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thememoryofchiffon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a> or <a href=""http://thememoryofchiffon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>.</p></div></div>","The Story

<h3>Finding My Cool</h3>
<p>Hello everyone. My name is Aja King and I am a licensed professional clinical counselor, and counseling psychologist. I educate the community, organizations, and my patients about the importance of mental wellness. Although I am able to help strangers, my personal struggle with helping my 7 year-old-son find his peace within school was a tremendous heartache for my family.</p>
<p>Being a single mother of two boys is not easy. Every parent hopes their child has success and happiness within their lives. Far too often, parents have to watch their children struggle as they find their way within this chaotic world. I was prompted to write my first children's book based on my son's struggle within school.</p>
<p>When Austin entered into kindergarten, everyone was hopeful and excited for him. As the school year started, the calls from the school became more frequent. We managed to get through kindergarten with several tears, fears, and eventually, his graduation. Then we entered into first grade. With our fingers crossed, we both hoped for the best. Yet, the calls begin to come more frequent, and even more urgent. Austin struggled, but not due to any mental health or behavioral issues, but rather, trying to understand how to find his cool in the mist of chaos within the classroom. Austin is doing much better, but he had to find ways to help him relax when the educational experience became overwhelming.</p>
<p>As a mental health therapist, I have heard the stories of other parents whose children have also struggled within the classroom, and the heartache this has caused. Many parents do not have the opportunity to volunteer within their child's classroom, or conduct a team collaboration to ease the tension of learning.</p>
<p>""Finding My Cool"" is a book based on Austin's experience, and how he learned to become more centered. With the help from others ($5,000), I will be able to get the illustration, an editor, and the proper packaging to get my books into the hands of parents and teachers who want to enhance the educational experience.I have a team of people who are going to help with this experience. If the goal is not reached, I will still use the proceeds to fund the project. This has to happen, because far too often children are becoming discouraged, and believe they are a problem. The book will also include a link for more resources, and a Youtube channel where they can watch Austin practice his ""cool"". Please help me reach my goal to get this important message to those who want to help their child find their cool. </p> </div></div>","Finding My Cool

But the years went by, and nothing emerged.</p><p>As a successful and ambitious author, that sounded like a call to action. As a Cambodian-American, I was moved to write a different kind of vampire story, a fresh and new one, that would bring ancient Asian vampire mythology and customs into the dramas of the modern world, and abandon the tired old Western versions that have dominated movies and literature for the last hundred years.</p><p>When a traditional Asian vampire flies, nothing is seen but a glowing head with internal organs dangling below.

Crafted for readers who love vampires, romance and fantasy as well as for readers who enjoy an exciting, new novel. Read sample chapters here.I like vampire novels, but was hungry for something that would breathe new life into the vampire genre so popular all over the world. But the years went by, and nothing emerged.As a successful and ambitious author, that sounded like a call to action. As a Cambodian-American, I was moved to write a different kind of vampire story, a fresh and new one, that would bring ancient Asian vampire mythology and customs into the dramas of the modern world, and abandon the tired old Western versions that have dominated movies and literature for the last hundred years.When a traditional Asian vampire flies, nothing is seen but a glowing head with internal organs dangling below. But my vampires break even that mold. They are translucent, wild and spellbinding, and drip with dark mystery and spirituality. The invasion of the original Asian vampires is long overdue! Get real! 60% of the world’s population, or 4.3 billion people, are Asian. And not one 21st-century Asian vampire?On June 29, 2013, I pitched my Asian vampire concept, Rise of the Golden Aura, to the California Institute of Contemporary Arts. They were so excited that they awarded me a grant to write it the very next day. Later, they additionally funded my trip to Cambodia, where I researched ancient Khmer sites, such as the Bayon Temple. They even paid for a helicopter flyover of Angkor Wat, the largest religious temple complex in the world, so I could feel what it’s like for my vampires to return to home base.For the next three years, I poured my heart and soul into the novel. Emerging from it all, exhausted but fulfilled, I realized I had an inspirational vampire tale unlike any other, bursting from its pages to thrill and entertain readers everywhere.It was time for the next step. Inspired by my publisher W.W. Norton’s rags to riches story, the indie author movement and Shark Tank (ABC’s #1 Hit TV Show), my childhood entrepreneurial spirit was rekindled. My literary agent had previously sold my award-winning memoir, When Broken Glass Floats: Growing Up Under the Khmer Rouge, to W.W. Norton.  But this time, I would strike off on my own. On October 16, 2015, I established Moon Power Media, an independent book publisher, to publish Rise of the Golden Aura, future books in the series, and other independent literary ventures.I've taken this path because becoming an independent publisher is important to me. It allows me to retain my artistic direction, improve my income, and market books in ways better suited to their target audience. Additionally, the success of this campaign will one day help me establish a branch of Moon Power Media in Cambodia, a country without a professional publisher since its destruction in the 70s by the Khmer Rouge and other governments.  With your support, I hope to help rebuild Cambodia’s publishing industry.Viewed in the light of the present and the past history of our world, my new book is a unique mix of family and friendship values, redemption, the struggles of PTSD by war survivors, leadership, humor, and Khmer legend and actual world events. As author and reviewer Justin Wintle said, Rise of the Golden Aura is “. . . exactly the sort of fusion fiction our global village needs.”A blind man’s vision: an ancient royalty reincarnates as a supernatural queen whose golden aura is visible only to the spirit world.JD Bophatip, abandoned as a baby in Cambodia, grew up in America.

They allowed me to come to the US as a 16-year-old teenager with my spirit battered but unbroken, and to go forward into life with an ethic of hard work, accomplishment, family values, and respect for others.As an Asian-American author, I saw a lack of literature featuring the struggles of Asian youth: young adults attempting to succeed in the modern world with ancient values, struggling to help their family, honor their elders and not disgrace their ancestors, and to put hard work and dedication above personal pleasure.  It's a fascinating world if you haven't been there, and I wanted to give Westerners a glimpse into it.I wrote Rise of the Golden Aura to make an impact.  By contrast to other YA literature, JD Bophatip, the hero of my novel, is an Asian teen of substance, on her way to becoming a great leader.  Abandoned as a child, and struggling to adapt to life in a new world, she learns that she is targeted for destruction by terrifying supernatural forces of darkness.  As these powers begin to envelop her, she discovers secret strengths sleeping within,  that allow her to confront, battle, and ultimately triumph over hate and evil.  JD is a young woman fighting to be all she can be. JD’s life is joyful, meaningful, and important.Aside from wanting to bring forth an original and exotic vampire novel, I wrote Rise of the Golden Aura to provide inspiration and empowerment to young people of all languages and cultures. Its theme and its appeal are eternal: a young girl awakens to the strength and destiny lying within her, rises to battle overwhelming forces with nothing but her strength of character, and emerges into adulthood victorious.I hope that you will join me in my dream to spread the word of empowerment, adventurousness, self-confidence and positive values to our young people everywhere.The risk is behind me.  I took the risk when I invested 3 years of my life into writing this book.  All that remains now is THE CHALLENGE: to win your support.  With your funding, this book WILL succeed.  Where’s the risk?  To succeed, a book must be a great story, and get effective promotion.  I proved that I can write a great story with the success of my memoir, the internationally acclaimed and award-winning When Broken Glass Floats. I’ve shown that I can promote by rising from a parentless child immigrant to a voice of importance in the US and worldwide.  I mentioned some examples of that in the “About the Author” section. Can I successfully PROMOTE this book with your funding?  Well, consider my previous promotional accomplishments:As a child survivor, author and international speaker, my words have been heard on the BBC, Al Jazeera, the Voice of America, Cambodian National TV, Australian radio and TV, and U.S. radio and television. I have been featured as the keynote speaker at lecture halls in the U.S., Australia, Cambodia, Canada and Denmark.In 2004 I received a personal thank-you letter from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for ""giving voice to those who have none.""  In it, she reflected, ""Dear Ms. Him . . . Thank you so much for sharing [When Broken Glass Floats] with me and the world . . . Courageous individuals such as yourself help give voice to those who have none and remind us of our obligations to humanity . . . You are an inspiring woman.""In April 2000, Justin Wintle, author of Perfect Hostage: A Life of Aung San Suu Kyi : gave my memoir, When Broken Glass Floats, a glowing review in the (London) Sunday Times.  In 2016, upon reading an advance reader copy of Rise of the Golden Aura, he summarized it as follows: ""Greatly entertaining . . . high fantasy, vampirism and romance . . . exactly the sort of fusion fiction our global village needs.""On April 17, 2000, Kirkus Reviews enthusiastically reviewed my memoir When Broken Glass Floats: “A worthy and compelling debut . . . to open the past and avenge the victims of the Khmer Rouge . . . a simply told, yet inspirational memoir about the reign of the Khmer Rouge, that helps to shed light on the plight of the Cambodian people.”  In 2016, after reading Rise of the Golden Aura, Kirkus Reviews held two more thumbs-up:  “Him tells the least traditional vampire tale . . . the vampire (or ‘arb’) imagery from Cambodian lore can be astonishing . . . an uplifting tale of a teenager championing two cultures . . . a slice-of-life YA novel.""In 2016, after reading an advance reader copy of Rise of the Golden Aura, Princess Soma Norodom of Cambodia, author of Royal Rebel, remarked: “. . . so riveting . . . The love story between JD and Ryker was so beautiful . . . I'm ready for the second book.""  Professional reviewers have given this novel a “go”.  I’ve proven that I have skills to promote it.  Where’s the risk? All this book needs is YOUR FUNDING to go forth into the world and prosper.Maybe you can’t afford a perk, but would like to help.  Please spread the word about this campaign on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Instagram, and LinkedIn, and by e-mailing the campaign link to friends and family. You can use Indiegogo’s share tools to do this, or simply cut and paste the website url into your email.I’m so very excited to share Rise of the Golden Aura with you! In addition to being an exciting new entry into the vampire genre, it has a beautiful book cover, and an elegant interior design by a wonderful artist and friend, Rachel Lawston, in London. It’s done and ready to go to print! Please help me bring my new baby to life by CONTRIBUTING!In closing, thank you from the bottom of my heart for your consideration, your support, and your interest in helping me to inspire and empower our global village!Saum​ preah​ bratan​ po​ nak!  (May God bless you!)Chanrithy Him",37.0,0,"1 Campaign

Do not forget that also who appears as an extra can upset the protagonist's adventure! 500$ (limited to 15) And in the end “cherry on the cake”, A SPECIAL SURPRISE! I want you to take part in the very world of Merìdia, you, yourself as a main character of a new short story, that I’ll write and publish at the end of this campaign. You can choose which race to belong to: Men, Dwarves, Elves, Orcs and Enchanted People, and also the character class: a warrior, a knight, a spy, a cleric...; It will be something like the background for a role-play game. I also need your name and if necessary it will be adapted to the setting; some traits of your personality in this story (cheerful, gruff, braggart, pessimistic, optimistic…), and some physical details ( long or short hair, build, height…etc.). Then I will devote myself to write this story where you will be the protagonists who enter the fantasy world of Merìdia, forever and concretely.This is a unique chance! DON’T MISS IT!  HERE YOU ARE!! Thanks for having devoted ALL THIS TIME to me. I hope I have roused your interest in the exploration of the vast lands of Merìdia ! For any question, you can write here on the campaign page, or directly to me at this address norysilnano@libero.it. I will be glad to reply to you! A BIG HUG TO YOU ALL!In all friendship and gratitude,Cristian.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This Campaign is to produce the German version of the Non-Duality Tarot. If we exceed the funding goal, we will make an English translation and produce an English version of the Tarot.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Non-Duality is the direct path to connect with its wholeness and the origin of being. After decades of meditation and stagnation on my way I found non-duality. It helped me very quickly, better and better to get directly to my ""true nature"" and also to stay there, something that I only managed with other meditation techniques after hours of meditation, more by chance.</p>
<p>The Non-Duality Tarot is my contribution to bring this knowledge closer to more people.</p>

<li>The combination of a tarot and oracle card set, which can also be used as an introductory course in non-duality.</li>
<li>The completion of the set with a guided online course with multimedia content to deepen the topic even further.</li>
<li>In the online course there are two videos for each card (approx. 10-15 minutes each)</li>
<li>once with guided contemplations - consisting of questions on self-enquiry - and Meditations tailored and guided to the theme of the card.</li>

<h3>The Woodshed</h3>
<p>With two books, and a number of new tunes in the works, Gern f. is going woodshedding at Silver Studios. Woodshedding is the process of going somewhere different - like a woodshed - with only the wood, your art and your brain. With your support, Gern f. will bring forth art that the world so sorely needs in these hard times (plus the slight possibility of woodcarvings).</p>
<h3>The Art</h3>
<p><i>“ I always believed that the best form of travel was to set yourself up in one place and let the world wander by.”</i> – Gern f.</p>
<p>Following his book, <i>“Turn Right, Turn Left, Repeat: Life on the road for the Canadian Indie Band,”</i> Gern is crafting a collection of stories inspired by 20 years standing behind a bar while the world came through the door. Stories that while not necessarily the truth, expertly blend the facts, small lies and tall tales of the “truths” we all act upon. </p>
<p>And the music…you knew there was gonna be music coming…</p>
<p>So get excited, contribute what you can, and <i>keep an eye out for exclusive audio/visual bonus material awarded to all contributants.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Be Part of the Process</h3>
<p>We have <strong>one very</strong> short month to raise the funds that will allow Gern to take the time to put in the labor and care required to bring to completion a couple of fantastic projects for your reading and listening pleasure. <strong>All contributions, great and small</strong>, even the price of a lousy cup of coffee, will have a very real and much appreciated impact on this goal.</p>

<h3>About the Founders</h3>
<p><strong>Michael Muyot</strong> was born and raised in the Hudson Valley.  His father retired from IBM and Michael watched the aftermath of the IBM downsizing and offshoring to overseas workers. Because of this, he created a way to bring jobs back to the Hudson Valley and other communities like it, by introducing a theory of building and investing in local economies through online technologies. As president and co-founder of Local Analytics, he partnered with StateBook International to create a Community Building software. His love for the Hudson Valley and his passion for creating more jobs for his community, led to his co-creation of “12550 the Zine” to shine a light on the local artists and bring more creative people to the place he loves to call home: Newburgh.</p>
<div><div><p><strong>Markus Hartel</strong> was born in a small industrial town in western Germany. His creative itch matched his love for mechanics when he started a typesetting apprenticeship.

Once he grew restless, he closed shop and moved to NYC where he became one of the better known modern Street Photographers. Eventually, the city was too chaotic for the life he wanted to pursue and he found Newburgh in an article while on vacation. One visit to Newburgh had him and the perfect letterpress had him hooked.

I am a writer, producer, pug lover, husband, dad (and more! so multifaceted!) and I currently live in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>I moved to LA from Maryland with hopes of writing things that people would read and/or watch on screen. After a few years of creating episodes of television, low budget movies, and other projects for other people, I decided to write exactly what I wanted to write and thus <i>The Happenstances...</i> books were born.</p>
<h3>What is <i>The Happenstances... </i>Series?</h3>
<p>This is a book series for young adults of all ages. Yes you could hand this book to your 13 year old, but I suspect you'll dig this easy read if you're of any age and you're looking for a fun book to read by the pool or at the beach or somewhere where you're wishing you were at one of those first two places.</p>

<p>The first book is a bittersweet, nostalgic, but comic story about a team of misfits, including a loser who secretly lives in the guard house of the club, a struggling artist with webbed toes, a timid teen with a concave chest, and the beautiful heiress of the Comfort Inn fortune. They have to win the impending Tri-County Relay Race and save the club from being run by a management company that only cares about money. The management company hires an opposing relay team of ringers including a girl with a prosthetic dorsal fin and a man named Carmichael Schmelps who looks suspiciously like a certain Olympic gold medalist.</p>
<h3>Why now?</h3>
<p>The first book in <i>The Happenstances...</i> Series, <i>The Happenstances at the Yellow County Community Swim and Racquet Club the Summer Before Last</i>,  was published 5 years ago as of this June. The previous publisher never did a Hardcover edition so I thought a fun way to celebrate the 5 year anniversary would be to release a Hardcover with a never before released short story in <i>The Happenstances... </i>universe.</p>

We aim to do this by highlighting the variety of voices, talent and perspectives that make up Brooklyn’s rich, intersectional tapestry through art, design, recipes, poetry and stories. We have encountered some of the most creative, interesting, generous, intelligent and generally incredible people while working in the service industry, and this magazine is an ode to all of them. We also hope to forge a community in which we can all showcase our talents beyond service work and bond over shared experiences. As anyone who has ever worked in hospitality knows, we got stories for days.</span></p>
<p>We would like to prioritize the voices of women, BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ within the industry, though we hope to do so from a place of inclusivity, not exclusivity. We are not interested in foodporn, ""trendy"" new openings or pretentious reviews. Our focus is on people, the heart and soul of hospitality.</p>

Giorgia is a Brooklyn native with a degree in Communication Design.  Emi received her Bachelor's degree in Hospitality Business from Michigan State University and has been in the hospitality industry ever since, she has been living in Brooklyn for 10 years. </p>

Kies het boek dat je wil voorlezen.
Scan de ISBN-code op de achterflap van je boek.
Ginger downloadt de geluiden die voor het boek beschikbaar zijn.
Leg je smartphone opzij, binnen het bereik van je stem maar uit het zicht van je kindje. 
Start met voorlezen. Ginger luistert mee en zet je woorden om in geluid, muziek of stemmetjes, waardoor het verhaal een extra dimensie krijgt!
  GINGER is een app zonder digitale afleiding.Ginger maakt gebruik van spraaktechnologie.Dankzij deze slimme technologie:
hoef je je telefoon op geen enkel moment tijdens het voorlezen aan te raken;
voeg je géén extra schermtijd toe aan de interactie met je kind;
speelt de app automatisch geluid af op precies het goede moment in het verhaal.
Ginger werkt dus heel eenvoudig en dat is doelbewust. Zo kan je je volledig focussen op je kind en het verhaal.   GINGER is een app die ouders en hun kindjes dichter bij elkaar brengt. #wistjedat?
Boeken voorlezen draagt bij tot de verbinding tussen ouder en kind. 
Wanneer je kinderen van jongs af aan voorleest, wakker je hun leesmotivatie aan. 
Lezen heeft een belangrijke invloed op de cognitieve en sociale ontwikkeling van je kind en stimuleert het de creativiteit.
Door geluiden toe te voegen aan alle mogelijke verhalen draagt GINGER een steentje bij. Je kind gaat nog meer op in het verhaal en tegelijk wordt de fantasie, creativiteit en plezier van jou en je kind extra gestimuleerd.Ook voor ouders, wordt voorlezen dus nog leuker!    DoelstellingenOnze groeiplannen - CROWDFUNDING VOOR MEER GINGERLancering & aanbodWat als elk verhaal een geluidsdimensie kreeg? Ons doel is om GINGER op 1 oktober 2021 te lanceren. Steun onze crowdfunding en krijg als eerste toegang aan een fixe korting! Uiteraard garanderen we een ruim aanbod. Bij lancering zorgen we voor geluid bij 100 prentenboeken en tegen eind 2021 maken we daar een aanbod van 300 (of meer!) van. Dat zijn 15 nieuwe titels van prentenboeken waar GINGER geluid bij creëert per week.Ook de uitbreiding naar prentenboeken in andere talen staat op het programma.  Sociaal-maatschappelijke meerwaardeInvesteren in kwalitatief geluid? Natuurlijk! We willen jonge creatievelingen aan het werk zetten. Zo kan je van uniek en kwalitatief geluid genieten.En steun je onze crowdfunding? Dan steun je ook een goed doel. Onder het motto #eentjekopeneentjegeven doneer je bij elke aankoop van een GINGER abonnement, een gratis abonnement aan één van de gezinnen die door Stichting de Voorleesexpress worden begeleid.Deze organisatie zorgt ervoor dat kinderen met een taalachterstand extra aandacht krijgen. Vrijwilligers zetten zich  in om thuis met ouders en kinderen aan de slag te gaan met taal en voorlezen. Hun doel is om leesplezier een vaste plek te geven in alle gezinnen.

Sono uno spirito libero e creativo... il mio lavoro è la mia passione. Nei ritagli di tempo ritaglio pazientemente nuove suggestioni. I miei progetti rispecchiano il mio risveglio e una nuova attenzione per i meravigliosi mondi attorno e dentro di me. Cercando la leggerezza anche nella quotidianità ho scoperto un nuovo dialogo con un materiale fragile e inconsistente.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527758610/qlvwx5lnadyypt5hnhlg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>A MESSAGE OF LIGHT</strong></i> .</p><p>The harmonious and poetic images became a route, a story, very similar to mine and to many others, I’m sure. In the book there are images and insights, there is no philosophical or religious orientation, but spiritual thinking, the topics are not exhaustive, just smell hints of the most know Master, but the experimentation is purely subjective. I focus on the present moment, to listen, observe and think autonomously; to better appreciate peace, quietness and also our effervescent society. I want to bring a spark to underline the fact that every single moment of this crazy and fantastic live is worth living, with availability and with an open heart, you can choose your best way to find easiness and happiness.</p><p><i><strong>UN MESSAGGIO DI LUCE</strong></i></p><p>Le immagini, armoniose, poetiche, sono diventate un percorso, un racconto simile alla mia storia e, sono sicura, anche a tante altre storie. Nel libro ci sono immagini e spunti di riflessione, non c’è orientamento filosofico e teologico, non parlo di religione, ma di spiritualità; gli argomenti trattati non sono esaustivi, accenno agli insegnamenti dei maestri spirituali più noti, ma la sperimentazione è soggettiva. Pongo l’attenzione al momento presente, per ascoltare, osservare e ragionare autonomamente, poter apprezzare la pace e la quiete ma anche la nostra effervescente società. Voglio portare una scintilla di luce per dire che si può gustare ogni istante di questa pazza fantastica vita, con disponibilità e cuore aperto, si può scegliere la via più adatta per trovare benessere e felicità.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527757606/fyvtv01nyweee8tx0gea.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>A BOOK FULL OF SURPRISES</strong></i></p><p>Every picture has an essential graphic, an equilibrium between full and empty, which reflects the problems that we daily encounter in order to develop and acquire a new welfare. I chose a 21cm x 21cm format, and only at the end of the job I realized that the images are also 21 cm; and thinking that everything happens for a reason, I remembered this curious fact where an American Doctor discovered that in the early ‘900 the actual weight of the soul: 21 grams!     The book has 21 pictures with easy phrases which make curiosity arise so that the reader can freely deepen the important spiritual topics. The book is dedicated to all the people that are looking for wellness and inner peace and have acknowledged that there is much more beyond the everyday reality! The pictures are realized through paper-cut , that is, white paper is carved, and in some pages it is possible to move some elements, which modify the final artwork and lets the book “self-animate”.The choice of black pages underlines the collision between full and empty and leads to surprise scenes.</p><p><i><strong>UN LIBRO PIENO DI SORPRESE</strong></i></p><p>Ogni disegno ha una grafica essenziale, un equilibrio tra il pieno e il vuoto che rispecchia le problematiche che incontriamo quotidianamente. Ho scelto il formato 21 cm. X 21 cm. e solo alla fine del lavoro mi sono resa conto che le immagini erano proprio 21; pensando che nulla succede per caso, mi sono ricordata di un fatto curioso in cui un medico statunitense agli inizi del ‘900, riuscì a scoprire quale fosse il peso dell’anima: 21 grammi! Il libro ha 21 immagini accompagnate da semplici frasi (scritte in 2 lingue) che fanno sbocciare la curiosità per approfondire liberamente temi spirituali importanti. E’ un libro dedicato a tutte le persone che hanno capito che la realtà non è solo ciò che si vede! Le immagini sono realizzate con la tecnica paper-cut, ossia la carta bianca viene intagliata e traforata e, in alcune pagine, si possono muovere degli elementi modificando così il disegno finale che si completa e si anima. Le pagine nere di sfondo fanno risaltare il contrasto tra pieno e vuoto e a volte celano altre scene a sorpresa.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527758458/ylw8goq9sx1hnn0ntiul.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>TOGETHER WE CAN DO A LOT</strong></i></p><p> I thought that, it is a way to create together positive energy, because I thoroughly believe this small book is message of light and your contributions will be fundamental.

In my spare time I patiently carve out new suggestions. My projects reflect my awakening and they pay attention to the wonderful worlds  around and inside me. Looking for an ever day lightness I discovered a new dialogue with a so fragile, inconsistent and short lasting material as paper.IO E LA CARTA Ciao, mi chiamo Cecilia e vivo con la mia famiglia a Verona. Sono uno spirito libero e creativo... il mio lavoro è la mia passione. Nei ritagli di tempo ritaglio pazientemente nuove suggestioni. I miei progetti rispecchiano il mio risveglio e una nuova attenzione per i meravigliosi mondi attorno e dentro di me. Cercando la leggerezza anche nella quotidianità ho scoperto un nuovo dialogo con un materiale fragile e inconsistente. A MESSAGE OF LIGHT .The harmonious and poetic images became a route, a story, very similar to mine and to many others, I’m sure. In the book there are images and insights, there is no philosophical or religious orientation, but spiritual thinking, the topics are not exhaustive, just smell hints of the most know Master, but the experimentation is purely subjective. I focus on the present moment, to listen, observe and think autonomously; to better appreciate peace, quietness and also our effervescent society. I want to bring a spark to underline the fact that every single moment of this crazy and fantastic live is worth living, with availability and with an open heart, you can choose your best way to find easiness and happiness.UN MESSAGGIO DI LUCELe immagini, armoniose, poetiche, sono diventate un percorso, un racconto simile alla mia storia e, sono sicura, anche a tante altre storie. Nel libro ci sono immagini e spunti di riflessione, non c’è orientamento filosofico e teologico, non parlo di religione, ma di spiritualità; gli argomenti trattati non sono esaustivi, accenno agli insegnamenti dei maestri spirituali più noti, ma la sperimentazione è soggettiva. Pongo l’attenzione al momento presente, per ascoltare, osservare e ragionare autonomamente, poter apprezzare la pace e la quiete ma anche la nostra effervescente società. Voglio portare una scintilla di luce per dire che si può gustare ogni istante di questa pazza fantastica vita, con disponibilità e cuore aperto, si può scegliere la via più adatta per trovare benessere e felicità. A BOOK FULL OF SURPRISESEvery picture has an essential graphic, an equilibrium between full and empty, which reflects the problems that we daily encounter in order to develop and acquire a new welfare. I chose a 21cm x 21cm format, and only at the end of the job I realized that the images are also 21 cm; and thinking that everything happens for a reason, I remembered this curious fact where an American Doctor discovered that in the early ‘900 the actual weight of the soul: 21 grams!     The book has 21 pictures with easy phrases which make curiosity arise so that the reader can freely deepen the important spiritual topics. The book is dedicated to all the people that are looking for wellness and inner peace and have acknowledged that there is much more beyond the everyday reality! The pictures are realized through paper-cut , that is, white paper is carved, and in some pages it is possible to move some elements, which modify the final artwork and lets the book “self-animate”.The choice of black pages underlines the collision between full and empty and leads to surprise scenes.UN LIBRO PIENO DI SORPRESEOgni disegno ha una grafica essenziale, un equilibrio tra il pieno e il vuoto che rispecchia le problematiche che incontriamo quotidianamente. Ho scelto il formato 21 cm. X 21 cm. e solo alla fine del lavoro mi sono resa conto che le immagini erano proprio 21; pensando che nulla succede per caso, mi sono ricordata di un fatto curioso in cui un medico statunitense agli inizi del ‘900, riuscì a scoprire quale fosse il peso dell’anima: 21 grammi! Il libro ha 21 immagini accompagnate da semplici frasi (scritte in 2 lingue) che fanno sbocciare la curiosità per approfondire liberamente temi spirituali importanti. E’ un libro dedicato a tutte le persone che hanno capito che la realtà non è solo ciò che si vede! Le immagini sono realizzate con la tecnica paper-cut, ossia la carta bianca viene intagliata e traforata e, in alcune pagine, si possono muovere degli elementi modificando così il disegno finale che si completa e si anima. Le pagine nere di sfondo fanno risaltare il contrasto tra pieno e vuoto e a volte celano altre scene a sorpresa. TOGETHER WE CAN DO A LOT I thought that, it is a way to create together positive energy, because I thoroughly believe this small book is message of light and your contributions will be fundamental. On this platform, it is possible to finance projects also with small amounts. Each of will take part to this adventure by choosing a special gift among the objects created for this special occasion.( gadget, postcards, t-shirt and experience). The copies of the book won’t be purchasable in shops but only through this “crowd funding campaign”. I immensely thank you and appreciate your support, and hope to share soon the results of our collaboration. I am really convinced that all together “good  energy” can truly increase!

<p><strong>Vision</strong></p>
<p>There’s something very unfortunate about the message we send children of color when they don’t see themselves in books.  After all, books, especially children’s books transmit values. That’s why I wrote MY SKIN HAS POLKA DOTS.  It is a board book featuring a boy with brown skin and multi-colored spots.  The pages are full of bold colors and whimsical illustrations that will add a new perspective to the conversation about skin color and encourage children ages 0-5 years old to never question the brilliance of their differences.  Delivered in a playful, child-centered tone, it reminds us of the connection between appearance and ancestry, and is a fun rhyming message that parents and children will love to read again and again.</p> <p><strong>A book about skin:</strong></p>
<p>So why does a book about skin color matter?  Well, this book was inspired by the journey of a friend’s son. When I found out that he was asking how the brown could actually be washed off, I allowed myself to be sad for a moment (because um, tear!) and then was committed to a solution in the form of this book.  The concept that his skin color was given to him by his grandparents and all of his ancestors excited him. It excited me too! So often, beauty is explained by comparison. So rather than saying brown is pretty because it's the same color as say, a chestnut horse (weird right? But those are lyrics from a song on a popular children's show!), we can find new and interesting ways to have conversations with children all of shades and with any kind of spots. I see books as a powerful tool in reinforcing values; reflecting back to children how they are special and matter to this world. I humbly think this book can help parents have meaningful conversations even with their little ones. My 16-month old loves this text (he hasn’t even seen the illustrations yet!), and I hope it can bring a similar level of humor and meaning to your family too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About Me:</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I’m Jenile. I live in Los Angeles with my husband and 17-month old son, and I want to tell stories that can inspire, amuse, and teach your children.  Writing a children’s book has been a natural progression for me that combines my intentional approach to motherhood with my background as a television writer and producer, having gotten my start at Nickelodeon over a decade ago. I had always dreamed of writing for children one day, but after becoming a mother, and struggling to find board and picture books for my son with diverse characters that could awaken things like compassion for others, reinforce academics, or just tickle the funny bone -- “one day” turned into right now.</p> <p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>My plan to self-publish is a deliberate attempt to have a direct conversation with the recipients of this book - parents and supporters just like you who can use it to spark conversations in your families and circles of influence. It’s hard to find books with diverse characters; made for diverse audiences. It’s even harder to find them in board book form to reach infants and toddlers!  If you join this campaign, not only are you helping to share a fun and empowering message with young children, you’re also helping add to the growing collection of board books for early readers of color.</p> <p><strong>Costs of Campaign and Plan for Funding</strong></p>
<p>With the funding I raise from this campaign, my plan is simple. I want this book published! It’s why I have simplified the level of sponsorship to accommodate a bulk order of 500 books, the cost of shipping and receiving an ISBN/Barcode.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Levels of sponsorship:</strong></p>
<p>$10 - e-book with bold and colorful illustrations &amp; a special thanks mention at the end of the book!</p>
<p>$30 - physical board book, signed and with a dedication to the recipient (yay!) &amp; a special thanks mention at the end of the book!</p>
<p>$100.00 physical board book, signed and with a dedication to the recipient (yay!) a special thanks mention at the end of the book, and a customized illustration featuring any child in your life surrounded by people in their family tree. You submit photos; I will turn those photos into a custom illustration and print on canvas with an excerpt from the book that says ""I love my family so I'm proud of everything that's me."" and deliver directly to you. This makes a great gift!</p> <p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>In addition to financial pledges, I would love if you could forward this link to even just one mother of a toddler (or father, or auntie, or caregiver...) with whom you think this message would resonate.  Thanks so much to my family and friends for supporting this creative dream, and to all of you for the consideration!</p>

<p>Reflecting on how quickly technologies change our lives, I tried to imagine what our world would be in the near future. So the idea of the book was born, and I did not notice how it was written.</p>
<p>This is the story of a musician who cannot come to terms with the new order of the world in which technology is increasingly taking space from people.</p>
<p>Who is this book for?</p>
<p>If you also, like me, often think about the future of the world, you will like it.</p>
<p>If you are young and think what profession to choose, the book will be useful.</p>
<p>If you like music, in particular rock, then, most likely, after reading you will recommend the book to your friends.</p>
<p>I wrote the book in Russian, I think on it. I would like to publish it on Amazon, but Amazon does not publish books in Russian. Therefore, I am here.</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps thanks to this campaign for Indigo, the world will read the book and change a little for the better.</p>
<p>This is the first book I wrote, but I still have a lot of ideas. I hope that these ideas will also turn into good interesting books.</p>
<p>Now professionals should work on my manuscript so that I would not be ashamed of reviews on Amazon. I need a literary translation into English, I need the services of an editor, and I also need to prepare a good cover.</p>
<p>Anyone who can help me hold these events, has a unique opportunity to be one of the first to receive a new warning novel, which, perhaps, sometime will be filmed.</p>

<h3>About Mannison Press</h3>

The plucky little indie publisher hit the ground running, and by the end of last year had published a full multi-author anthology and nine Mannison Minibooks, with plans in place for several more Minibooks, two full-length collections, and a companion volume for the anthology.</p>
<p>However, starting up a small business can be rather costly. Even with a growing catalogue of publications, the financing of larger endeavors -- like another anthology -- can still be quite a challenge. </p>
<p>But that's where you can help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Crowdfunding for our previous anthology, ""Little Girl Lost,"" provided just enough for us to meet our three primary objectives: pay our contributing authors, offset production costs, and fulfill the perks offered by the campaign. Our goal for this new companion volume has been set at $1,500 which will help cover the following expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Paying our authors.</strong> The first anthology was capped at 13 authors; this one, however, is being left open for consideration. We anticipate between 12 and 15. Contracted authors are offered a payment of $0.02 per word and a copy of the book itself. This is very attainable if the campaign is successful! Of the funds we raise, 80% will be allocated to paying our authors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fulfillment of perks. </strong>We would like to offer our biggest supporters something in return! While some of the perks cost nothing to fulfill (like ebooks and illustration packages), other perks include various bundling of our anthologies in print. The remaining 20% raised by this campaign will be used to fulfill these perks.</li>
<li>
<strong>If we don't reach our goal,</strong> the entirety of funds collected will still go into the project! While some fundraising programs will refund all monies raised if the project goal isn't met, IndieGoGo only maintains a minimum requirement. As long as we reach this minimum, we will receive the funds. So, every little bit helps!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So what happens if this anthology is a success? Just as was stated in the previous campaign: WE. DO. MORE. Simple as that. Ideas are already flowing for future anthologies.</p>
<p>This project will also help boost visibility as the company continues to develop other areas of publishing. For example, we look forward to further expanding our line of ""Mannison Minibooks."" These are a non-serial line of short stories in print...miniature books to be read in a single sitting. But don't let their pocket-size cuteness fool you! Some of these stories are heavy-hitting.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Are there risks? For us, sure. We have put a lot of heart and soul, sweat and tears, dollars and cents into our fledgling company. However, if you choose to back our project here on IndieGoGo you can rest easy! Once the campaign reaches a minimum amount, the funds will be released to us and allocated as described above. And if it doesn't reach the minimum? No worries, friend...you will be refunded the full amount. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<strong></strong><h3>What the Book is About </h3>
<p>My name wasn't on the Forbes 400 List of wealthiest Americans, but until the winter of 1983, I was living a fairly comfortable life. <i>A Day at the Fare: One Woman's Welfare Journey</i> is the story of my flight from a cozy, middle-class home in Savannah, Georgia and my plunge into a life on welfare while living in rough-and-tumble, low-income neighborhoods of Jacksonville, Florida.</p>
<p>The memoir describes how I ended up on public assistance, adapted to a grueling lifestyle 
as a lowly recipient and then rebounded from my loss of economic 
security.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438916608/a8z1u4pccducbz2aekew.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><i>                                                   ...to a neighborhood lined with these</i><i><br/></i>
</p>
<p>Twenty-eight years old, with two children and an income that was well below poverty level, the most basic necessities became luxuries. I did what was necessary to survive in a crime-infested, drug-ridden community, while I struggled to create something better. I sought out and used every resource, kept the faith and jumped through one hoop after the other, but I never expected that ""the system"" I relied upon would be a source of so many of my problems.
</p>
<p>Despite a plethora of obstacles, through education I discovered what might be a way for me to move beyond welfare. However, because of my 
household's economic frailty, I first had to ensure that conditions were right before I could free my family of its dependency.<br/></p>
<p>General Patton defined success as how high someone bounces after hitting the bottom. <i>A Day at the Fare: One Woman's Welfare Journey</i> shows that the way to such victory is through courage, perseverance and self-discipline.</p>
<p><b>HERE'S A BRIEF SCENE FROM THE BOOK:</b></p>
<p><strong>EXCERPT 1</strong>  <br/></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>""I was doing a balancing act with three big, plastic garbage bags of dirty clothes filled to capacity wedged inside Cedric's red metal wagon and every bump along the sidewalks was challenging my balance. I pulled it with my back in a hunch as I herded the kids in the rain, just grateful for the change in my pocket. It had taken me half a dozen trips to the store, sometimes buying a single item, to collect the cash in change--the way I did for kerosene. Coin collecting from food stamp purchases was the only way I could pay for our laundry or buy soap, sanitary supplies, hair grease, toothpaste and other hygiene necessities I couldn't buy with food stamps. Diapers were more expensive than any of those items, so they were the toughest to save for, requiring more trips for change over a greater number of days.</p>
<p>Negotiating the curbs along Moncrief Road was difficult. Cedric and I had to hold down the bags inside the wagon while one of us held Devin's hand. Plodding along with the load jerking from side to side, I reminisced about my convenient laundry room in Savannah, when two of the garbage bags fell to the ground. We halted and I slung them back on top of the pile, and tried to mash them down. There was no rush, of course. We were already wet anyway.</p>
<p>We stood still again at the crosswalk of the 20th Street Expressway, where I noted how long it took the traffic lights to change and looked in both directions many times. It was hard to trust that every car in the double lanes of barreling traffic would come to a stop when those signals went from yellow to red. I strategized our positions for safety: Devin secured to my hip, Cedric pressing down on the mounds, and me tugging the wagon. Stepping off the curb and onto the freeway, I was a mother duck ensuring the safe passage of her ducklings. Out on the asphalt, entirely exposed to the openness of the roadway, the sidewalk on the other side might as well have been a mile away. </p>
<p>There would have been no sense in postponing the trip to the laundromat because of the chance of rain. A chance of rain is likely most days in Florida; it rained the day before and it was likely it would rain the next day, too. Meanwhile, the boys and I needed clean clothes. <i>Thank you, food stamp change. And thank you, God, for the money and detergent to wash our clothes.""</i></p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm an empty-nester and former journalist who put off writing<i> </i>this memoir<i> </i>for over a decade while I worked full-time as a training instructor, raised my children, pursued higher education and managed a vibrant household. <br/></p>
<p>Now I am eking out a living while happily materializing my vision: to apply my written and oral communications skills to benefit others in a more personal way. A big education buff, I consider literacy and a curiosity for learning important factors in minimizing poverty and welfare dependency.  <br/>
</p>
<p>A former newspaper reporter and freelance journalist, I enjoy blogging. I have created <a href=""http://www.pamelamcovington.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Poverty and Welfare in the United States</a> as a place to discuss problems of and solutions to poverty and
low-income survival, the state of education, welfare reform, income disparities,
economic opportunities and welfare alternatives.  <br/></p>

<h3>My Mission 
</h3>
<p>Since the early '90s, I've been confessing the story of that destitute period of my past. Whether my listener is someone fortunate enough to have never needed public assistance or a person who is presently struggling, they lean forward and their eyes widen as I summarize my harrowing experiences. Many fumble for the words to respond and others remark, ""I had no idea that..."" </p>
<p>People often declare, that after hearing about what I managed to rise up out of, they are certain they can overcome a challenge they are facing. Nodding and smiling, they appear more determined to give whatever it is their best shot. And practically everybody I explain my bygone ordeal to says, ""You need to write a 
book. A lot of people would benefit from hearing your story."" <br/></p>
<p>So I did. <br/>
</p>
<p>With the manuscript completed and ready for the next stages of development, my mission is to make sure that <i>A Day at the Fare's</i> poignant messages inform and inspire as many readers as possible. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438749334/nu3hnt2arr6hitfetrvi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                           
<i>Documents I referenced while writing </i>A Day at the Fare.<b><br/><br/>I bared my soul in this book in order to depict how:</b>
<ul>
<li>the current societal stigma surrounding welfare is no different than that of decades ago</li>
<li>adversity can strike anyone at anytime</li>
<li>life is about choices, even more so when living in survival mode with low or no income<br/>
</li>
<li>the keys to welfare independence include exercising resourcefulness and maintaining an ""odds-beater"" attitude <br/>
</li>
<li>today's welfare system doesn't appear to have improved much from how it operated in the '80s</li>
</ul> <b>MY VISION IS</b> to create and circulate a compelling, well-written, high-quality book available in paperback, eBook and audio formats and after publication, to speak publicly, educating and motivating audiences by expanding upon its topics. I also intend to connect with concerned organizations and determine what I can do to help reduce poverty through literacy, education and inspiration. <br/><br/>
<h3>Why I Am Asking for Your Support</h3>
I thought I could do it all alone: write my book, self-publish it and market it. I was wrong; it's not that simple--or low cost. To make my manuscript the best it can be and launch the book into the marketplace and beyond, I need the expertise of others every step of the way. And expertise costs. The success of this campaign will determine how many people will benefit from <i>A Day at the Fare'</i>s message of tenacity and resolve.<br/><br/>
<h3>What Is the Impact of ""A Day at the Fare?""<br/>
</h3>
From talking to people in church groups and writers' groups, on planes and on 
the Internet, in libraries, coffee shops and college classrooms, I've heard how my story corrects some common misconceptions about welfare and rekindles a person's belief in the ability to conquer adversity by applying dogged determination.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439160938/gczcs306lqbudbypuod1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b>By contributing to this campaign you will:</b><ul>
<li>provide a source of inspiration for those who are undergoing a personal trial</li>
<li>become part of an initiative to address an overlooked aspect of 
impoverished peoples' needs: self-esteem and belief in themselves--two essentials for taking action to assume more responsibility for and control of their lives</li>
<li>help dispel the myths of what life on welfare in the United States is like. Many persons who sit in judgement of recipients have never experienced economic hardship or the frustration of dealing with the welfare system<br/>
</li>
<li>support efforts to encourage welfare recipients that they, too, have what it takes to leave ""the fare""</li>
<li>assist in stimulating an informed, speaking-from-experience dialogue 
about what works and what doesn't work in today's welfare system</li>

</ol><ul> </ul><div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks and Challenges</h3> <p> <b><b>I CAN DO THIS! </b></b>I've been writing for 30 years and have had hundreds of stories and 
articles published. As a single-parent mom, I have acquired some pretty amazing juggling skills that transition to this project perfectly. Having earned a MS in management, a 
MS in human resources management and a BA in communications is also helpful. And talking with people, conducting presentations and facilitating are second nature to me; I've spent 12 years in the classroom as a training instructor, I'm a Toastmaster and I'm motivated to touch people's lives.   <b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Risks.</b> If I do not achieve my funding goal and can't hire the help I need, completing <i>A Day at the Fare</i> will take much longer. Given the current wobbly status of low-to-middle income people in our country,
 doesn't the idea of further delaying the dissemination of my book's important messages sound absolutely awful?
</p>
<p>With adequate funding there is no risk of the project not reaching completion.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>But, if this campaign does not reach its funding goal, </b>based upon how much money is generated, I will use it to achieve these high-priority tasks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have the manuscript edited </li>
<li>Cover designed and<br/>
</li>
<li>Text formatted for print and eBook<br/>
</li>
<li>Then go back to ""the drawing board.""<b> </b>I will not give up.

<p>Thanks to my latest contributors, I made it to the $150 milestone, so here's Excerpt 2 as promised. I'll post another when the campaign reaches $250, and then more as we work our way up to revealing a draft of the book's cover.  THANK YOU to the campaign's contributors for believing in and supporting my project!</p>
<p><b>EXCERPT 2: </b></p>
<p>""I began my tour, tiptoeing with caution, in case I wasn't alone. The front room was a casualty: huge cracks ran up two walls with chunks of plaster missing, a broken chandelier hung dangerously low from its wires and a heap of clothes and other things lay in the middle of the faded vinyl floor. In one bedroom, a section of the ceiling had caved in, and in the other one, the bottom half of a window had been covered with plywood. The kitchen was ghastly, especially the area where a stove used to sit: the vacant wall was coated with dark brown streams of grease that had stopped short as they oozed towards the floor. <br/></p>
<p>The house was an absolute mess. There was nothing I could do with it or for it. Beside the filth, collapse and decay, there was something else present: a vibration that I equated with death. It wasn't just the hollowness, its rankness or grunge that disturbed me, but its grim ambiance. <i>Who knows what has gone on in here?</i> The house was too near its own end to help me launch a new beginning. <br/></p>
<p>On my way out, I stopped to kick through the pile of stuff in the middle of the living room floor. A spread of newspapers fell aside and uncovered a white linen Christmas tablecloth with dozens of intricately embroidered poinsettias and a dainty lace trim. The two of us had something in common; we represented class in the midst of rubble. On a whim, I decided to rescue it and make it a part of my future revival. Together we crossed over the windowsill and back into the land of the living.</p>
<p>The boys didn't get to go inside that house, either. When Cedric asked how it was, I just told him, ""bad--<i>real </i>bad."" As  I positioned my left hand on the steering wheel and was about to turn the key with my right, I smelled something. Ugh! The stench of the house was on my hands.</p>
<p>The third address I'd written down, two bedrooms at $125 a month, was on McMillan Street. The house was another version of the same thing. The roof had a bumpy patchwork of different-colored shingles and strips of aluminum siding on the driveway side were hanging loose. The front gate was locked, but like many others who it seemed had visited the place, I simply clambered over a portion of chain link fence to get into the yard. I had barely opened the front door and set foot inside when an odor resembling raw sewage sent me running back out. I'd seen and smelled enough. <i>This isn't gonna work. </i><br/></p>
<p>I'd spent the day running around town, and all I was doing was burning gas and adding miles to my rental truck bill. Not to mention that all I'd seen was shitholes. I didn't expect to find anything near the level of comfort I had left behind in Savannah--that would not have been realistic--but neither did I foresee being forced to live in such deplorable conditions. With that stark realization, I retreated to the truck wistful and light-headed.""</p>
<p> <br/></p>
<p><b>EXCERPT 3:</b></p>
<p>""Friday night was like camping--without the warmth of a fire, since we still didn't  have power. Dinner was canned green beans, cold bologna sandwiches and fruit punch drink. While there was daylight, the children and I moved about like everyone else, but by nightfall we were huddled around the light of candles and using a flashlight to wander around. I had done my best, given the thorny circumstances leading to securing the apartment, but there was no way I could have timed the move to avoid suffering the temporary problems. Grateful that we weren't on the streets adding to the rental truck bill, I was at peace about them.</p>
<p>We worn worn out, anyway. I embraced the sleep induced by the evening's early darkness--except for the overnight chill of temperatures fluctuating between the 40s and 50s. The cozy moving quilts were with Mr. Lawson. Devin and I slept nestled to one another, wrapped in bed sheets and our daily clothes, while Cedric lay on his own mattress. <i>How will we warm ourselves come winter? A space heater downstairs isn't going to send heat upstairs. I'll have to figure something out about that. </i><br/></p>
<p>Since it had worked for us before, once again we walked to McDonald's to wash up in the ladies' room and wolf down a couple of toasty breakfast sandwiches. It was our first full day at home and there was plenty of work for me to do. There was sweeping to be done throughout the apartment, as well as unpacking boxes, setting the plants around and hand washing and air-drying what I could of our clothes. One of my main tasks was reassembling Devin's crib so he could at least have the familiarity of his own bed. How alien the fine white crib with the Winnie the Pooh Plexi-Glass end panel appeared in the drab room. The lackluster space was nothing like the cheerful, mint green bedroom he'd had in Savannah, with its tall windows, white baseboards with matching crown molding, marble fireplace and polished hardwood floors. The most noticeable feature of the boys' new room was its contrast to the other: a single, decaying window, nondescript baseboards painted the same bland color as the walls and a mottled, gray tile-square floor.</p>
<p>Shutting out the memories of a house gone by, I returned to reality, putting a sheet on the mattress and pulling the crib away from the window to avoid Devin sleeping in a draft. Cedric's twin bed fit along the longer wall."" <br/></p>

<p>Thank you again, dearest contributors. The campaign did close reaching above the $400 milestone. Here is the next excerpt as promised. Highest and Best to each of you. I hope you enjoy the excerpt. <br/></p>
<p><b>EXCERPT 4:</b></p>
<p>""My heart was racing. As we hurried back to the truck, I kissed the keys I held between my fingers. I felt liberated. All of the driving around was about to stop, and at long last the truck could be unloaded. Explaining to the children that we probably had a place, I was practically shouting. Granted, I hadn't even seen it, but I had pretty much concluded that I was going to take it. <i>What position am I in to say no?</i> This was our sixth day with the truck and I was as close as I could be to renting anything just so I could unload it.  <br/></p>
<p>Driving nearer to the address, and compared to the other places I'd seen, I decided the area wasn't looking that bad. I turned onto Payne Avenue and drove up to an enormous, pink U-shaped cluster of concrete tenements taking up the entire lengthy block. I turned right onto West 12th Street and scanned the address numbers until I found mine: 6120, close to the road's dead end. I walked up to the door, inserted my prized key and, with breath held, pushed it open.</p>
<p>A single multi-paned window lit the tiny front room. The walls were beige, and freshly painted; I could still smell it in the air. The dull brown tile floor had been patched over. There were indentations in it where previous tenants planted space heaters, and at the top of the wall I could see the thing he'd called the ""flue."" Built into the same wall was a closet under the steps, its door cut at the angle of the staircase leading to the second floor. <br/></p>
<p>The kitchen was trying to be white, though it was too old, to succeed. It too, contained only one window--a slim one, that was a crank case type, like the one in the front room. The cabinets were so thickly layered with coats of paint that the hinges had a tough time swinging. I looked under the sink. Flakes of rust from the bottom of the crusted cabinet drawers had fallen to the space below, and there were gaping holes in the wall around the pipes. Outside the small kitchen window I saw a large, open common yard, lined with individual pole sets for clotheslines. I hadn't noticed as I'd driven up, but the building was adjacent to railroad tracks. <br/></p>
<p>I next climbed the green pebbly stairs to have a look at the bedrooms. The front one, the one I decided would be mine, was a grayish, pale blue. The back one had been painted a drab schoolhouse green. Each had one multi-paned window. Neither closet had a door. I would have to hang curtains there.</p>
<p>The little  bathroom was shadowy. The tub, barely trimmed in dried-out caulk, had tarnished, old-fashioned faucets and a stationary showerhead. I slid my hand across its irregular surface. Certain spots were gritty, while others were covered with paint. But at least it was a standard-size tub. Atop the outdated sink were separate mismatched hot and cold-water spigots and the toilet boasted a black horseshoe-shaped seat, the kind I remembered from elementary school. I couldn't test the plumbing, because the water wasn't on. <br/></p>
<p>Living in cement would take some adjusting; it would be like residing inside a vault. And the unit was awfully small; not one room in my home in Savannah had been as small as any of those in the apartment--except maybe the closet in the master bedroom. But although I was torn between relief and dismay, I believed that I could make the apartment do. <br/></p>
<p>I took the boys inside and let them walk through. It was about to be a done deal; the frantic search for housing was over. I would finally have a home base to begin rebuilding my life from. <i>What a relief!""</i>   <br/></p>

</div></div>","What the Book is About 
My name wasn't on the Forbes 400 List of wealthiest Americans, but until the winter of 1983, I was living a fairly comfortable life. A Day at the Fare: One Woman's Welfare Journey is the story of my flight from a cozy, middle-class home in Savannah, Georgia and my plunge into a life on welfare while living in rough-and-tumble, low-income neighborhoods of Jacksonville, Florida.
The memoir describes how I ended up on public assistance, adapted to a grueling lifestyle 
as a lowly recipient and then rebounded from my loss of economic 
security.

                                             From a neighborhood lined with these...
                                                   ...to a neighborhood lined with these

Twenty-eight years old, with two children and an income that was well below poverty level, the most basic necessities became luxuries. I did what was necessary to survive in a crime-infested, drug-ridden community, while I struggled to create something better. I sought out and used every resource, kept the faith and jumped through one hoop after the other, but I never expected that ""the system"" I relied upon would be a source of so many of my problems.

Despite a plethora of obstacles, through education I discovered what might be a way for me to move beyond welfare. However, because of my 
household's economic frailty, I first had to ensure that conditions were right before I could free my family of its dependency.
General Patton defined success as how high someone bounces after hitting the bottom. A Day at the Fare: One Woman's Welfare Journey shows that the way to such victory is through courage, perseverance and self-discipline.
HERE'S A BRIEF SCENE FROM THE BOOK:
EXCERPT 1  

""I was doing a balancing act with three big, plastic garbage bags of dirty clothes filled to capacity wedged inside Cedric's red metal wagon and every bump along the sidewalks was challenging my balance. I pulled it with my back in a hunch as I herded the kids in the rain, just grateful for the change in my pocket. It had taken me half a dozen trips to the store, sometimes buying a single item, to collect the cash in change--the way I did for kerosene. Coin collecting from food stamp purchases was the only way I could pay for our laundry or buy soap, sanitary supplies, hair grease, toothpaste and other hygiene necessities I couldn't buy with food stamps. Diapers were more expensive than any of those items, so they were the toughest to save for, requiring more trips for change over a greater number of days.
Negotiating the curbs along Moncrief Road was difficult. Cedric and I had to hold down the bags inside the wagon while one of us held Devin's hand. Plodding along with the load jerking from side to side, I reminisced about my convenient laundry room in Savannah, when two of the garbage bags fell to the ground. We halted and I slung them back on top of the pile, and tried to mash them down. There was no rush, of course. We were already wet anyway.
We stood still again at the crosswalk of the 20th Street Expressway, where I noted how long it took the traffic lights to change and looked in both directions many times. It was hard to trust that every car in the double lanes of barreling traffic would come to a stop when those signals went from yellow to red. I strategized our positions for safety: Devin secured to my hip, Cedric pressing down on the mounds, and me tugging the wagon. Stepping off the curb and onto the freeway, I was a mother duck ensuring the safe passage of her ducklings. Out on the asphalt, entirely exposed to the openness of the roadway, the sidewalk on the other side might as well have been a mile away. 
There would have been no sense in postponing the trip to the laundromat because of the chance of rain. A chance of rain is likely most days in Florida; it rained the day before and it was likely it would rain the next day, too. Meanwhile, the boys and I needed clean clothes. Thank you, food stamp change. And thank you, God, for the money and detergent to wash our clothes.""
THANKS TO MY EARLY CONTRIBUTORS! I'LL POST ADDITIONAL EXCERPTS AS THE CAMPAIGN PROGRESSES: NEXT ONE WHEN IT REACHES $250 
About Me
I'm an empty-nester and former journalist who put off writing this memoir for over a decade while I worked full-time as a training instructor, raised my children, pursued higher education and managed a vibrant household. 
Now I am eking out a living while happily materializing my vision: to apply my written and oral communications skills to benefit others in a more personal way. A big education buff, I consider literacy and a curiosity for learning important factors in minimizing poverty and welfare dependency.  

A former newspaper reporter and freelance journalist, I enjoy blogging. I have created Poverty and Welfare in the United States as a place to discuss problems of and solutions to poverty and
low-income survival, the state of education, welfare reform, income disparities,
economic opportunities and welfare alternatives.  


Clowning around on Red Nose Day in May before stepping out to help generate awareness about child poverty. 

My Mission 

Since the early '90s, I've been confessing the story of that destitute period of my past. Whether my listener is someone fortunate enough to have never needed public assistance or a person who is presently struggling, they lean forward and their eyes widen as I summarize my harrowing experiences. Many fumble for the words to respond and others remark, ""I had no idea that..."" 
People often declare, that after hearing about what I managed to rise up out of, they are certain they can overcome a challenge they are facing. Nodding and smiling, they appear more determined to give whatever it is their best shot. And practically everybody I explain my bygone ordeal to says, ""You need to write a 
book. A lot of people would benefit from hearing your story."" 
So I did. 

With the manuscript completed and ready for the next stages of development, my mission is to make sure that A Day at the Fare's poignant messages inform and inspire as many readers as possible. 
                           
Documents I referenced while writing A Day at the Fare.I bared my soul in this book in order to depict how:

the current societal stigma surrounding welfare is no different than that of decades ago
adversity can strike anyone at anytime
life is about choices, even more so when living in survival mode with low or no income

the keys to welfare independence include exercising resourcefulness and maintaining an ""odds-beater"" attitude 

today's welfare system doesn't appear to have improved much from how it operated in the '80s
 MY VISION IS to create and circulate a compelling, well-written, high-quality book available in paperback, eBook and audio formats and after publication, to speak publicly, educating and motivating audiences by expanding upon its topics. I also intend to connect with concerned organizations and determine what I can do to help reduce poverty through literacy, education and inspiration. 
Why I Am Asking for Your Support
I thought I could do it all alone: write my book, self-publish it and market it. I was wrong; it's not that simple--or low cost. To make my manuscript the best it can be and launch the book into the marketplace and beyond, I need the expertise of others every step of the way. And expertise costs. The success of this campaign will determine how many people will benefit from A Day at the Fare's message of tenacity and resolve.
What Is the Impact of ""A Day at the Fare?""

From talking to people in church groups and writers' groups, on planes and on 
the Internet, in libraries, coffee shops and college classrooms, I've heard how my story corrects some common misconceptions about welfare and rekindles a person's belief in the ability to conquer adversity by applying dogged determination.
By contributing to this campaign you will:
provide a source of inspiration for those who are undergoing a personal trial
become part of an initiative to address an overlooked aspect of 
impoverished peoples' needs: self-esteem and belief in themselves--two essentials for taking action to assume more responsibility for and control of their lives
help dispel the myths of what life on welfare in the United States is like. Many persons who sit in judgement of recipients have never experienced economic hardship or the frustration of dealing with the welfare system

support efforts to encourage welfare recipients that they, too, have what it takes to leave ""the fare""
assist in stimulating an informed, speaking-from-experience dialogue 
about what works and what doesn't work in today's welfare system
enable me to fulfill a new, even more meaningful purpose in life


  What I Need and What You GetIf this campaign reaches its funding goal of $11,000, here's how it will be spent: 
Professional editing services for the manuscript: $1,500 - $1,800

If the funding goal is reached, A Day at the Fare: One Woman's Welfare Journey will be released this winter. The audio book will be available Spring 2016. I've got stretch goals, too. Should this campaign supersede its funding objectives I will:  
Attend the upcoming conference ""Beyond Housing: A National Conversation on Child Homelessness and Poverty 2016"" hosted by the Institute for Children, Poverty and Homelessness (ICPH) in NYC January 13 -15
Volunteer to travel to and speak at an event for one of the non-profit organizations which assisted me during the time period described in the book

Expand my marketing efforts
Consider having a book launch party. That would be wonderful.

Purchase new eyeglasses. This pair has had it! 


WATCH THE PROJECT UNFOLD RIGHT HERE!! I can't wait to share the excitement with you via regular updates.

    Risks and Challenges  I CAN DO THIS! I've been writing for 30 years and have had hundreds of stories and 
articles published. As a single-parent mom, I have acquired some pretty amazing juggling skills that transition to this project perfectly. Having earned a MS in management, a 
MS in human resources management and a BA in communications is also helpful. And talking with people, conducting presentations and facilitating are second nature to me; I've spent 12 years in the classroom as a training instructor, I'm a Toastmaster and I'm motivated to touch people's lives.   
Risks. If I do not achieve my funding goal and can't hire the help I need, completing A Day at the Fare will take much longer. Given the current wobbly status of low-to-middle income people in our country,
 doesn't the idea of further delaying the dissemination of my book's important messages sound absolutely awful?

With adequate funding there is no risk of the project not reaching completion.

But, if this campaign does not reach its funding goal, based upon how much money is generated, I will use it to achieve these high-priority tasks:

Have the manuscript edited 
Cover designed and

Text formatted for print and eBook

Then go back to ""the drawing board."" I will not give up.

EXCERPTS AND UPDATES:

I couldn't test the plumbing, because the water wasn't on. 
Living in cement would take some adjusting; it would be like residing inside a vault. And the unit was awfully small; not one room in my home in Savannah had been as small as any of those in the apartment--except maybe the closet in the master bedroom. But although I was torn between relief and dismay, I believed that I could make the apartment do. 
I took the boys inside and let them walk through. It was about to be a done deal; the frantic search for housing was over. I would finally have a home base to begin rebuilding my life from. What a relief!""",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Your contribution will help me bring Flora's story to bookshelves and touchscreens around the world (and there are MANY rewards of the book and my award-winning piano music for your donation).</b> Until recently, a traditional publishing house was necessary. But in the 21st century, I can share Flora's story with a vast audience. Self-publishing has become mainstream. Have you heard the term, ""artisanal publishing?"" An artisan is someone who ""makes a high quality and distinctive product by hand."" It means that the author (me) lovingly oversees every aspect of the book's production, choosing a team of people who'll help me create, not just a book, but <b>a beautiful work of art that will inspire all who read it. </b><br/></p>
<p>To do that, I need your help! The cost of publishing <i>In Duet with God</i> is $12,000. Four-and-a-half years of writing and almost an entire lifetime went into creating this book. The hard part is done. I'm now hand-picking the best people I can find in the art and self-publishing world. Here's what your support makes possible:<br/></p>

<b>Cover Artist -</b>  You CAN tell a book by its cover! Stephanie Anderson is a fabulous painter and illustrator. Her covers appeared on books published by Simon &amp; Schuster, and received the Jane Addams Peace Honor. Have a look at one of Stephanie's paintings. She's currently creating a beautiful cover<br/>illustration that captures in delicate detail the feeling of Flora and her relationship to life.

formatting of the text. The inside of a book needs designing, too.<br/></p></li>
<li><p><b>Copy Editor and Proofreading </b>- All editors are <i>not</i> created equal! I've been blessed to find Sarah Aschenbach. One author said: ""Sarah

<b>Attorney's Fees - </b>This is an unusual and significant aspect of the budget. Last year, in the middle of my writing the book, I was appointed by the NY Supreme Court as Flora's legal guardian.

<p><i>Evelyn’s Lighthouse</i> is a unique project…. a family project.  It brings together two writers, Mark Roberts (52) and his niece, Pate Clevenger (12), working together to tell the story of Evelyn Young, the daughter of the lighthouse keeper at <strong>Split Rock Lighthouse</strong> in Minnesota in 1924.  Combined, these two writers have crafted a story that young women today will find fun, encouraging, and even filled with suspense.</p>
<p>While Evelyn is a fictional character, the story is historical and is thoroughly well-researched and fact based.  The operation of the lighthouse, where the station is and its role, the technologies of the time, and more are all set very carefully and historically in the year 1924.  Real people are used throughout and the geographical details and places are accurate.  The novel gives readers the opportunity to step back in time and see what life was like at a lighthouse in 1924 (and <a href=""http://sites.mnhs.org/historic-sites/split-rock-lighthouse"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Split Rock</a> is a fabulously beautiful and very famous light station), and to learn from Evelyn’s adventuresome spirit, love of reading, and her determination to help her family and her lighthouse.</p>
<p><i>Evelyn’s Lighthouse </i>has been completed, except for some final editing.</p>
<p>We are trying to raise $3500 so as to present the best and most polished book to the reader possible.  The $3500 will go largely to pay for professional editing services.  We have engaged <a href=""http://www.annhowardcreel.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ann Creel</a> to edit the manuscript.  Ann is a professional author, writer, and editor who has written many books for the young adult audience, including American Girl books.  Ann has edited the first half of the book with good results.  She is very complimentary of the writing and believes in our book.  We think her editing skills and experience will go a long way toward making<i> Evelyn’s Lighthouse</i> the best possible book for you, the reader.  The rest of the funds will go to cover design and artwork and promotional fees.</p>
<p>Before starting this project, Mark had found, like every parent/uncle/grandparent has in the past few years, that it’s really difficult to spend time with family without those phones, that we’re all so addicted to, intruding.  Mark began this project so he could spend real, quality time with his niece, Pate, who is now his co-author.  So please consider that<i> this project is more than just a project.  This book is more than just a book.</i>  It’s also a <i>BRIDGE</i> that will take your niece, your daughter, …. YOU, back in time to America in 1924.  A time without mobile phones…. but a time with so much to say. </p>

Strangely all the roads had led to Rome before I wrote the powerful and inspirational book, the Hall of the Maccabiah.</p><p>In 2004 in Israel I took a broadcast course specializing in radio and TV.  As my final test I was given a studio assignment: I had to act like I was broadcasting from the Stadio Olimpico di Roma. At the time I didn't know that sport and Rome will play such a special role in my life. </p><p>Few years later I moved to Rome. </p><p>In 2011, on the Independence Day of Israel I was walking in the Jewish ghetto in Rome and something caught my eyes. I saw the symbol of Maccabi. I went closer and met <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Fabrizio Della Rocca, the President of Maccabi Rome. He gave me a T-shirt of Maccabi Italia and immediately I felt the part of the community. </span></p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>After a while you cannot live in Rome without writing. I felt that the old stones were speaking to me. I got inspired in the beautiful alleys of Trastevere quarter and I started to practice writing. I became a journalist. </span>I have been working for the Israeli leading daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth (ynet).</p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>In 2014 in Rome I took part in a leadership seminar called Future Leaders Forum organized by the European Maccabi Confederation. I met wonderful speakers, life coaches and community leaders. I got a vision. I felt extremely inspired. I took part in many organizations and committees before but non of them was like Maccabi. </span></p><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Maccabi with all its inspirational athletes and its intelligent, warm-hearted and committed volunteers just simply fascinated me and motivated me to do something meaningful for a community. I felt in my heart that Maccabi is the right place for me as a young professional, as a Jewish woman and also as a runner.  </span></p><p>I kept taking part in the FLF seminars. In 2015 I participated in the Maccabi World Union Congress which was held parallel with the FLF Global Seminar. The Gala Night of the Congress was in Jerusalem. Andrea Murez, the famous Israeli swimmer who competed in the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016 went to the stage and announced the logo of Maccabiah 2017. In that moment the idea to write a book about Maccabiah was born in my mind. </p><p>I made a life-changing decision. I dedicated my time for writing and only for writing. I contacted to the top, most famous Jewish athletes, coaches, all-time superstars. I made interviews with talented, successful Maccabi sportsmen whose life was completely changed by the Maccabiah. I got inspired by Maccabi leaders all around the world. I was touched by the families who have connection to Maccabiah generation to generation. I gained energy from each person I spoke with. My life was filled with love and motivations every day through the commitment and the inspirational stories they shared with me during the interviews. I found their bound with Judaism and Maccabi to be incredibly special and strong. I realized we all represent the core values of Maccabi and that is why we all create a family together.  </p><p>These people, actually you, my dear Reader taught me that everything is possible. We are all here to inspire each other and lead our life to the direction we dream of. The stories of these wonderful people make the essence of the book.""</p><h3>Recommendations:</h3><p><i>""This book should be a compulsory reading in schools.""​</i></p><p><i>""This book was written from the heart. While reading the stories I felt like being in the Maccabiah, listening the mass of fans screaming in the stadium, experiencing the incredible love of communities and sharing the happiness of the athletes who gained medals for their countries. The words come to life in this book.""</i></p><p><i>""The author, Yaarit feels personaly responsible for preserving the amazing memories of the Maccabiah events to the next generations. She left her job to spend her time only with writing. She dedicated her life to write and publish this book. She is the soul of the book. Her commitment is a true inspiration and a source of love to me every single day. I feel honored that I could contribute to create this campaign ."" Barbara Burian</i></p><p><i>""I used to participate as an athlete in Maccabiah, now I take part as a volunteer and fan. I never won any medals but it was essential to me to be there as a proud Jew who belives in the power of sport and community. This book represents me what the real values are in the life."" </i></p><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482285932/kl32sfde2dowa7nrhtqc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><ul>

align=""right""><strong><span dir=""RTL"">הודעה אישית מהסופרת, יערית רחמים:</span></strong></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">""איך החל הקשר שלי עם מכבי? באופן מקרי כל הדרכים הובילו אותי לרומא לפני שכתבתי ספר עוצמתי ומלא השראה: היכל המכביה.</span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">בשנת 2004 למדתי בקורס שדרי טלוויזיה ורדיו, עבודת הסיום היתה לשדר מעין משחק,  והמקום שבחרתי באופן ספונטני היה לא אחר מאשר האצטדיון האולימפיקו ברומא. באותם ימים לא תיארתי לעצמי שהשילוב של ספורט ורומא ימלאו תפקיד כה משמעותי בחיי.</span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">כעבור מספר שנים עברתי לרומא.</span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">בשנת 2011 ביום העצמאות של ישראל טיילתי בגטו היהודי ברומא, ומשהו לכד את עיניי, ראיתי את הסמל של מכבי. התקרבתי ופגשתי את פבריציו דלה רוקה נשיא מכבי רומא שנתן לי במתנה חולצה של מכבי איטליה ומאותו הרגע הרגשתי חלק מהקהילה. </span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">אי אפשר לגור ברומא מבלי לכתוב. חשתי את המילים מגיחות מהאבנים ההיסטוריות והעתיקות, קיבלתי השראה מהסמטאות היפיפיות של רובע טרסטברה בעיר והתחלתי להתאמן בכתיבה. לאחר זמן מה הפכתי לעיתונאית ואני כותבת בידיעות אחרונות. </span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">בשנת 2014 ברומא לקחתי חלק בסמינר על מנהיגות עם קבוצה שנקראת: פורום המנהיגים העתידיים, שאורגן בידי קונפדרציית מכבי אירופה. פגשתי שם נואמים נהדרים, מאמנים לחיים ומנהיגי קהילות שכל כך גרמו לי להשראה. לקחתי חלק בהרבה ארגונים וועדות לפני ואף אחד מהם לא היה כמו מכבי.      </span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">מכבי עם כל מתנדביה המחויבים לה עם לב כל כך רחב, הספורטאים מעוררי השראה, הכל יחד הקסים ומילא אותי במוטיבציה לעשות דבר משמעותי לקהילה. חשתי בליבי שמכבי היא המקום הנכון בשבילי, כאשת קריירה, כיהודיה וגם כחובבת ריצה.</span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">המשכתי להגיע גם לסמינרים הבאים של אותה קבוצה. בשנת 2015 השתתפתי בקונגרס מכבי העולמי שהיה מקביל לסמינר העולמי של פורום המנהיגים הצעירים. הערב החגיגי של הקונגרס נערך בירושלים, אנדראה מורז השחיינית שייצגה את ישראל במשחקים האולימפיים בריו 2016, עלתה לבמה וחשפה את הלוגו של המכביה ה-20. באותו הרגע עלה במוחי הרעיון, לכתוב את הספר על המכביה.</span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">לקחתי החלטה משמעותית בחיי, הקדשתי את כל זמני לכתיבה בלבד. יצרתי קשר עם ספורטאים יהודים המפורסמים ביותר, מאמנים, הטובים ביותר בכל הזמנים. ראיונות עם כוכבים, ספורטאי מכבי מצליחים שחייהם השתנו בגלל המכביה. קיבלתי השראה ממנהיגים במכבי מכל רחבי העולם. התרגשתי מאוד מסיפורן של משפחות הקשורות במכבי מדור לדור. נמלאתי באנרגיה מכל אדם ששוחחתי איתו. חיי התמלאו באהבה ומוטיבציה בכל יום מבעד לסיפורים מלאי השראה ומחויבות שהם חלקו איתי במהלך הראיונות. מצאתי שהקשר</span> <span dir=""RTL"">עם יהדות ומכבי הוא מיוחד מאוד וחזק. הבנתי שאנחנו כולנו מייצגים את הערכים של מכבי ולכן כולנו יחד גם יוצרים משפחה אחת.</span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">האנשים האלה, הם למעשה אתה, קורא יקר, אתה מראה לי שהכל הוא אפשרי. אנחנו כולנו כאן מעוררי השראה האחד מהשני ואנחנו מובילים את חיינו אל הכיוון שאליו אנחנו חולמים. הסיפורים של האנשים הנפלאים האלו, הם המהות של הספר.""</span></p><h3 align=""right""><strong><span dir=""RTL"">המלצות:</span></strong></h3><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">""הספר צריך להיות חובת קריאה בבתי ספר""</span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">""הספר נכתב מהלב. כשקראתי את הסיפורים הרגשתי שכאילו הייתי במכביה, להקשיב לכמות של אוהדים צועקים באצטדיון, לחוות את האהבה הרבה של הקהילות שחולקות את שימחת הספורטאים שזכו במדליות עבור המדינות שלהם. המילים מתעוררות לחיים בספר"".</span></p><p align=""right""><span dir=""RTL"">""הסופרת, יערית חשה באופן אישי אחריות להנציח את הזיכרונות המדהימים של אירועי המכביה לדורות הבאים.היא עזבה את עבודתה כדי להשקיע את כל זמנה רק בכתיבה. היא השקיעה את חייה לכתוב ולפרסם את הספר. היא הנשמה של הספר. המחויבות שלה מעוררת השראה אמיתית ומקור של אהבה בשבילי בכל יום. אני מרגישה שנפל

Strangely all the roads had led to Rome before I wrote the powerful and inspirational book, the Hall of the Maccabiah.In 2004 in Israel I took a broadcast course specializing in radio and TV.  As my final test I was given a studio assignment: I had to act like I was broadcasting from the Stadio Olimpico di Roma. At the time I didn't know that sport and Rome will play such a special role in my life. Few years later I moved to Rome. In 2011, on the Independence Day of Israel I was walking in the Jewish ghetto in Rome and something caught my eyes. I saw the symbol of Maccabi. I went closer and met Fabrizio Della Rocca, the President of Maccabi Rome. He gave me a T-shirt of Maccabi Italia and immediately I felt the part of the community. After a while you cannot live in Rome without writing. I felt that the old stones were speaking to me. I got inspired in the beautiful alleys of Trastevere quarter and I started to practice writing. I became a journalist. I have been working for the Israeli leading daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth (ynet).In 2014 in Rome I took part in a leadership seminar called Future Leaders Forum organized by the European Maccabi Confederation. I met wonderful speakers, life coaches and community leaders. I got a vision. I felt extremely inspired. I took part in many organizations and committees before but non of them was like Maccabi. Maccabi with all its inspirational athletes and its intelligent, warm-hearted and committed volunteers just simply fascinated me and motivated me to do something meaningful for a community. I felt in my heart that Maccabi is the right place for me as a young professional, as a Jewish woman and also as a runner.  I kept taking part in the FLF seminars. In 2015 I participated in the Maccabi World Union Congress which was held parallel with the FLF Global Seminar. The Gala Night of the Congress was in Jerusalem. Andrea Murez, the famous Israeli swimmer who competed in the Olympic Games in Rio in 2016 went to the stage and announced the logo of Maccabiah 2017. In that moment the idea to write a book about Maccabiah was born in my mind. I made a life-changing decision. I dedicated my time for writing and only for writing. I contacted to the top, most famous Jewish athletes, coaches, all-time superstars. I made interviews with talented, successful Maccabi sportsmen whose life was completely changed by the Maccabiah. I got inspired by Maccabi leaders all around the world. I was touched by the families who have connection to Maccabiah generation to generation. I gained energy from each person I spoke with. My life was filled with love and motivations every day through the commitment and the inspirational stories they shared with me during the interviews. I found their bound with Judaism and Maccabi to be incredibly special and strong. I realized we all represent the core values of Maccabi and that is why we all create a family together.  These people, actually you, my dear Reader taught me that everything is possible. We are all here to inspire each other and lead our life to the direction we dream of. The stories of these wonderful people make the essence of the book.""Recommendations:""This book should be a compulsory reading in schools.""​""This book was written from the heart. While reading the stories I felt like being in the Maccabiah, listening the mass of fans screaming in the stadium, experiencing the incredible love of communities and sharing the happiness of the athletes who gained medals for their countries. The words come to life in this book.""""The author, Yaarit feels personaly responsible for preserving the amazing memories of the Maccabiah events to the next generations. She left her job to spend her time only with writing. She dedicated her life to write and publish this book. She is the soul of the book. Her commitment is a true inspiration and a source of love to me every single day. I feel honored that I could contribute to create this campaign ."" Barbara Burian""I used to participate as an athlete in Maccabiah, now I take part as a volunteer and fan. I never won any medals but it was essential to me to be there as a proud Jew who belives in the power of sport and community.

<p>My photographs will serve as an opportunity to look into an African’s woman’s eyes, celebrate her, and know Africa better than before. This will contribute to a better understanding of Africa and less discrimination and prejudice.

I <span>attribute this tendency </span>due to growing up surrounded by women; my dressmaker mother and all of her clientele.  This exposed me to the beautifully complex emotional range of women’s personalities, as well as a few core traits that seem to unite them as women.  Throughout my travels and work as a portrait photographer for a reputable newspaper in Brazil, I have built up a vast portfolio of beautiful portraits that audiences across the globe have enjoyed </i></p>

The photographs, accompanied by concise captions, will attempt tell the stories of these individuals while exploring the many identities and cultures of African women.</span></span></p><p><b>IMPACT </b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>My desired impact of this photo collection is to challenge preconceived notions and false beliefs about Africa and the women who live there. More developed parts of the world often see Africa as somehow being “less than” simply because it has LESS OF what modernize societies have. However, I believe this is a gross and potentially dangerous mistake. I wish for this project to open minds and lead them to a re-evaluation of what they believe they know. It is easy - human nature, even - to falsely judge what we do not understand.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>My goal for the impact of this project is to deliver understanding where it is needed. Prejudice cannot live long in an environment where there is understanding. The photographs will be published in a beautiful book that will serve as an educational tool, as well as a perfect addition to any art lover’s home. Additionally, in hopes of increasing the impact of this project, the photographs will be entered into contemporary galleries across the world including New York, London, and across Asia.</span> </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><span></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473335661/getjpg_mmevwb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span>For the art-lovers out there, this project will be designed to allow you to interact with me firsthand as I journey across Africa.

Precisely by slicing out this moment and freezing it, all photographs testify to time's relentless melt.” - Susan Sontag

We learn most - about ourselves and others -  by looking into the eyes of another human being. I want to help people to reconnect with the raw, largely untouched, beautiful place of humankind’s birth. I cannot think of a better way to accomplish that than to focus on the literal interpretation of birthing humankind: African women. 
My photographs will serve as an opportunity to look into an African’s woman’s eyes, celebrate her, and know Africa better than before. This will contribute to a better understanding of Africa and less discrimination and prejudice. I feel inspired to create this because I’m an artist, but even more so I feel devoted to creating this because I am human.
Setting off on adventures with only my backpack and camera, my love of photography evolved alongside my love of travel. My experience as a professional photographer over the past 8 years has lead me around the world--from my home country of Brazil to the streets of Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. I have found that wherever I travel, I am drawn to photographing the women I meet. I attribute this tendency due to growing up surrounded by women; my dressmaker mother and all of her clientele.  This exposed me to the beautifully complex emotional range of women’s personalities, as well as a few core traits that seem to unite them as women.  Throughout my travels and work as a portrait photographer for a reputable newspaper in Brazil, I have built up a vast portfolio of beautiful portraits that audiences across the globe have enjoyed 

Nadja SophieYou can see more of my work on GOOLE IMAGES and Also on 500px.comMy journey will begin in Cairo, where I will buy a cheap motorcycle. Over the course of 5 months, I plan to travel the length of Africa. I’ll be photographing women from Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi, Zambia, Botswana, Namibia and South Africa; to reflect the strong subcultures evident across the continent. And as if the stars weren’t already aligning for this beautiful project, 2017 will be 40 years of the  “International Women’s Day” when United Nations in General Assembly in 1977 adopted a resolution proclaiming a United Nations Day for Women’s Rights and International Peace to be observed on any day of the year - What better way to honor this 40 years  than to be creating art that will bring an audience to countless women’s stories throughout Africa?INTERACTION All the backers and sponsors of this project will be in direct communication with me through the project’s Facebook group and Whatsapp. Backers who’ve committed a certain level of support will be granted full communication access with me at all times. In addition to documenting my experience on the website, I will also maintain regular updates on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.. It’s incredibly important to me that you, the backers and sponsors, are integral part of this epic journey.ARTISTIC CONCEPT This photographic expedition will not only capture the beauty and diversity of African women, but also examine what it means to be an African woman in contemporary society; their individual lives and their places within their communities. The finished product I create will be deeply rooted in the belief that Africa is misunderstood and the desire to foster understanding and empathy. Every photograph will be shot through the metaphorical lense of connecting women from seemingly different worlds by highlighting what makes each one unique. The photographs, accompanied by concise captions, will attempt tell the stories of these individuals while exploring the many identities and cultures of African women.IMPACT My desired impact of this photo collection is to challenge preconceived notions and false beliefs about Africa and the women who live there. More developed parts of the world often see Africa as somehow being “less than” simply because it has LESS OF what modernize societies have. However, I believe this is a gross and potentially dangerous mistake. I wish for this project to open minds and lead them to a re-evaluation of what they believe they know. It is easy - human nature, even - to falsely judge what we do not understand.My goal for the impact of this project is to deliver understanding where it is needed. Prejudice cannot live long in an environment where there is understanding. The photographs will be published in a beautiful book that will serve as an educational tool, as well as a perfect addition to any art lover’s home. Additionally, in hopes of increasing the impact of this project, the photographs will be entered into contemporary galleries across the world including New York, London, and across Asia. For the art-lovers out there, this project will be designed to allow you to interact with me firsthand as I journey across Africa. This means that you are not only part of the product, you’re part of the process. You’ll have opportunities to appreciate the creation of art just as you appreciate the art itself. All backers will receive a digital copy of the book in PDF format, and the credit and gratitude for being an integral part of a photographic lesson that will impact audiences throughout the world.

<p>La asociación Colombiana de Lacrosse fue creada en el 2012, con el anhelo cumplir los sueños de jóvenes deportistas que desean tener la oportunidad de representar y dejar en alto el nombre de Colombia en eventos de talla mundial.</p>
<p>Desde entonces hemos puesto toda nuestra energía en la conformación de un equipo femenino de élite donde las jugadoras puedan crecer y desarrollar sus habilidades individuales y con el equipo. Para las jóvenes que se han unido a esta iniciativa, el Lacrosse se ha convertido en una parte muy importante de sus vidas y de su día a día, haciendo que cada día los sueños sean más grandes y las metas más altas.</p>
<p>Gracias al compromiso y al arduo trabajo que llevamos realizando, logramos conseguir un cupo para el mundial de mayores de Lacrosse que se llevará a cabo a finales de julio del 2017 en Londres.</p>
<p>Ahora tenemos el deber de cumplir el sueño de representar a nuestro país y dejar el nombre de Colombia en alto frente a más de 30 países que estarán allí compitiendo con nosotras y para lograr este sueño te necesitamos a <strong>TI.</strong></p>
<p><strong>¡Tú tienes mil maneras de ayudarnos!</strong></p>

<p>Allí somos las únicas representantes de Latinoamérica con experiencia y reconocimiento internacional, al llegar allí como deportistas dedicadas no sólo le daremos una cara diferente a Colombia sino a toda América latina, demostrando que podemos lograr lo que nos proponemos porque <strong>#SiSePuede.</strong></p>
<p>Asimismo, nuestra participación en el mundial dará la oportunidad a más jóvenes de disfrutar este deporte y hacer que sea reconocido a nivel nacional e internacional permitiendo a las jugadoras desarrollar su crecimiento deportivo y académico.</p>

<p>Todo tu aporte se destinará a cumplir nuestro sueño, comprando los implementos necesarios para jugar en el mundial y pagando los gastos del viaje de varias niñas alrededor de Colombia.</p>
<p>Uno de nuestros más grandes sueños es tener un centro deportivo para organizar una liga y así llegar a las personas más vulnerables. Desde nuestros entrenamientos diarios realizamos visitas a colegios y a lugares con mayor afectación social, para empezar a practicar y mostrarles que el Lacrosse en Colombia ¡sí existe!</p>

<p>One of our biggest dreams is to have a sports center to organize a league and reach the most vulnerable people. From our daily trainings we make visits to schools and places with some economic difficulties, to start practicing and show them that Lacrosse in Colombia does exist!</p>
<p>Through our activities, we provide other young people with a welcoming environment, away from bad habits and foster the free development of thinking and personality, making us all a great family that believes in the importance of sport and a Lacrosse team in Colombia.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge, besides from going to London, is to make ourselves known due to the fact that not many people know that there is a Lacrosse team in Colombia.</p>
<p><strong>We are a young team with a great dream we need your help to show everyone that WE ARE HERE!</strong></p>
<p>We want to evince that Lacrosse is not just a sport, it is a lifestyle and a big family that grows bigger every day.</p>
<p>We do not have full time coaches however among ourselves we have looked for the way to have discipline, to train and to give everything, but it has been a great challenge that we have surpassed reaching great achievements as the participation in the world cup sub 19 in which we show only a little bit of what we are capable.</p>

All your contribution will be destined to make our dream come true. We will buy the necessary items to play in London and we will pay the travel expenses of each girl in our team.
One of our biggest dreams is to have a sports center to organize a league and reach the most vulnerable people. From our daily trainings we make visits to schools and places with some economic difficulties, to start practicing and show them that Lacrosse in Colombia does exist!
Through our activities, we provide other young people with a welcoming environment, away from bad habits and foster the free development of thinking and personality, making us all a great family that believes in the importance of sport and a Lacrosse team in Colombia.
Our biggest challenge, besides from going to London, is to make ourselves known due to the fact that not many people know that there is a Lacrosse team in Colombia.
We are a young team with a great dream we need your help to show everyone that WE ARE HERE!
We want to evince that Lacrosse is not just a sport, it is a lifestyle and a big family that grows bigger every day.
We do not have full time coaches however among ourselves we have looked for the way to have discipline, to train and to give everything, but it has been a great challenge that we have surpassed reaching great achievements as the participation in the world cup sub 19 in which we show only a little bit of what we are capable.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The DRHH is universally regarded as Chas Balun’s finest work. The book was widely distributed around the world. Many have told us they read the volume until it literally fell apart!</p>
<p>The fans of this book are legion and here is just one of them. John Szpunar is the author of the phenomenal, Xerox Ferox, and here is his DRHH story:</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>The Importance of Reading RED</strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>by John Szpunar</strong></p>
<p>I can remember it, as clear as day.  The year was 1989, and my brother Dave and I were roaming around a place called Comix Corner in Fraser, Michigan.  I was on the lookout for a comic book called SHRIEK that I’d seen advertised in the recent FANTACO HORROR YEARBOOK.  I didn’t see it on the stands, so I asked the clerk behind the counter if the thing had crossed his path. </p>
<p>“SHRIEK?  You mean GORE SHRIEK?  We have a few issues of #6 left.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already got that,” I said.  “I read that FantaCo was going to launch a sister title called SHRIEK.”</p>
<p>The man cracked a smile.  “Well, we don’t have it yet.  But speaking of FantaCo… well, we <i>do </i>have this.”</p>
<p>He took me over to a glass display case and pointed to a sturdy square-bound book that rested inside.  I couldn’t believe my eyes.  There it was!  THE DEEP RED HORROR HANDBOOK.  I’d read about the thing in a recent issue of DEEP RED, and I was very keen to get my hands on a copy.</p>
<p>Now, you might think that I ended up taking the book home with me, but that wasn’t exactly the case.  You see, I had recently placed a direct order for the thing from FantaCo itself.  For all I knew, it was already enroute to my home.</p>
<p>Still—there it was in the flesh.  The man asked me if I’d like to page through it, but I decided against it.  I would have probably stood there until I read the thing from cover to cover.  Besides, this was something that I wanted to savor.</p>
<p>Around two weeks later, my own copy of the book arrived, and it changed my life forever.</p>
<p>I was already a rabid fan of the book’s editor, Chas Balun and his groundbreaking magazine DEEP RED.  I had dog-eared copies of THE GORE SCORE and HORROR HOLOCAUST on my bookshelf, but nothing could have ever prepared me for THE DEEP RED HORROR HANDBOOK. </p>
<p>The entire DEEP RED gang of writers was present and accounted for:  Steve Bissette, Graham Rae, Kris Gilpin, Greg Goodsell, Dennis Daniel, and Uncle Chas, himself.  By this time, these guys seemed like old friends, and I was overjoyed to be back in their company. </p>
<p>Now— make no mistake about it—this was a <i>book</i>.  Over 300 pages of vital information and criticism.  This, of course, meant that there was even more meat to chew on and that the DEEP RED gang was given ample space to explore their subjects completely.</p>

<p>Unlike other stories of it's kind, this is the <strong>WHOLE</strong> story of addiction, not a partial glimpse. My behind-the-scenes, nothing is off limits of what it is really like, beginning at childhood. That you do not miss the signs and make the same mistakes. </p>
</div>
<div>I feel for the loved ones that have addiction in their families and must say goodbye to someone that they love. The cruel reality is that some have passed away and some are still alive. What causes more pain? I am not sure. </div>
<div> </div>
<p>I hope The Sun is Gone ""inspires"" you to make a change in your life. Finding the strength and courage to move on from the present or the past. We are not promised a better life is easy; what we are promised is that it is possible.  </p>

<p>It has been a challenging last few years; it is takes work and much self-reflection to move through such loss and heartache. </p>
<p>So, changed, healed and proud, here I am today. Opening myself up for a world of judgment as I too kept secrets out of shame. But shame &amp; stigma keeps our loved one's sick and family members hiding. And for those of us that come from homes where alcoholism runs rampant, this continuing generation after generation.</p>
<p>I have not had a drink of alcohol in more than 20 years. The reason I gave up drinking is a secret I have kept from family members, friends, neighbors, co-workers and even my adult sons. No one that has met me in the last twenty years knows the secret I have never shared. If I had talked more openly and honestly with my little brother back then; about our past, about how I viewed alcohol, the lessons I learned, perhaps things might have turned out differently.  That is what I hope is our gift to you. </p>
<p>So, for me, the reward is much greater than the risk. A love story between a brother and sister in the hopes of helping someone else.  After all there is no life's lesson in hiding in shame. </p>
<p>Soon it will be a secret no more...</p>

<p>I am not going to spend my life arguing, debating and letting people break my spirit for the truth I know and believe with all my heart.

</div><p> </p></div>","Unlike other stories of it's kind, this is the WHOLE story of addiction, not a partial glimpse. My behind-the-scenes, nothing is off limits of what it is really like, beginning at childhood. That you do not miss the signs and make the same mistakes. 

I feel for the loved ones that have addiction in their families and must say goodbye to someone that they love. The cruel reality is that some have passed away and some are still alive. What causes more pain? I am not sure. 
 
I hope The Sun is Gone ""inspires"" you to make a change in your life. Finding the strength and courage to move on from the present or the past. We are not promised a better life is easy; what we are promised is that it is possible.  
Please help me on this journey. Whether you buy the book with 50% profits donated to Addiction & Mental Illness programs, make a contribution or share on Facebook and your social media, I will be so grateful.  
                                                                                 -hugs from me to all of you, Jodee







For those of you who don't me, I spend my time between my home in Sylvan Lake, Alberta & Oroville, Washington. Please be confident your contribution will be allocated to drug, alcohol & mental illness programs in the country to which you live as I am conscious of the fact that will mean something not only to the recipients, but to you. You & the benefiting organizations will be recognized on www.hopeandhumility.com within 60 days of the end of the campaign. Together we can make a difference. 


Any family member, friend or loved one that feels lost or alone in the present or the past, or knows someone struggling 
Adult Children of Alcoholics
Anyone struggling with breaking free from co-dependency, unhealthy relationships or enabling patterns
Chronic relapsers or their families
Treatment centers as a valuable tool for family members when their loved one enters treatment
Doctors, therapists, health care professionals as this is the non-clinical approach as to what they teach about addiction. 
College or universities as a powerful debate topic as to the causes of addiction for Psychology or Sociology classes. 
Those in recovery as a reminder of how far you have come. And that we all make mistakes, and deserve forgiveness. 
Anyone that has lost someone they love to alcohol, drug addiction, mental illness or suicide










It has been a challenging last few years; it is takes work and much self-reflection to move through such loss and heartache. 
So, changed, healed and proud, here I am today. Opening myself up for a world of judgment as I too kept secrets out of shame. But shame & stigma keeps our loved one's sick and family members hiding. And for those of us that come from homes where alcoholism runs rampant, this continuing generation after generation.
I have not had a drink of alcohol in more than 20 years. The reason I gave up drinking is a secret I have kept from family members, friends, neighbors, co-workers and even my adult sons. No one that has met me in the last twenty years knows the secret I have never shared. If I had talked more openly and honestly with my little brother back then; about our past, about how I viewed alcohol, the lessons I learned, perhaps things might have turned out differently.  That is what I hope is our gift to you. 
So, for me, the reward is much greater than the risk. A love story between a brother and sister in the hopes of helping someone else.  After all there is no life's lesson in hiding in shame. 
Soon it will be a secret no more...

  

""Addiction is a family disease and it will take a change of a whole family to turn it around. A poignant story of sibling love, the ability to change and the impact family structure has on recovery.""
-Dr. Frank Lawlis, Author Not My Child, Chairman of the Dr. Phil Advisory Board and Co-founder of the Lawlis Peavey PNP Center. 
""Truth hurts. And truth heals. The breath-taking honesty of Jodee Prouse’s powerful story is like a barrage of blows to the gut, as she tells of the unrelenting assault of addiction on the wounded body and soul of her family. Yet, it is that same brutal truth-telling that helped her recover from the hurt, not unscarred, but alive and at peace.  This beautifully written memoir proves that there is the power to heal in not remaining silent in the face of our most stigmatized of diseases.  I highly recommend  The Sun is Gone for the intimate and moving way it explores both sides of the truth-the darkness and the light.""
  --Bud Mikhitarian, filmmaker and author of Many Faces One Voice, Secrets of The Anonymous People
""A deeply intimate and moving story of trauma, loss, addiction, tragedy and the possibility of redemption.""
 -Gabor Maté M.D., Author, In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters With Addiction
""The Sun is Gone is to remind oneself that no one is alone on this heart-wrenching journey. Jodee illuminates early childhood patterns that poison adult dynamics, and shows how much damage can be caused by mistaking enabling for caring.""
 -Kim Barthel, Occupational Therapist specializing in Mental Health and Trauma, Co-author of Conversations with a Rattlesnake with Theo Fleury.   

You know, someone that knew my brother and I very well actually said right to me,
""Your brother was a junkie that deserved to die. He had more than enough chances."" 
I am not going to spend my life arguing, debating and letting people break my spirit for the truth I know and believe with all my heart. I remind myself and others when I speak about addiction is that this way of thinking is not at all about their loved one's or my brother character, it is about theirs. 

Please help me share and promote The Sun is Gone and my INDIEGOGO campaign even if you can't donate or buy the book. I am grateful for anything you can do to help. Very grateful.

But it's getting there, with steady progress every day, and there have been no problems on that front, so I expect to have this process finished very soon.Click HERE to review the detailed checklist/chart of the status of the work.Once all of these technical processes are completed I will output the files (a considerable endeavor in itself) and we will commence the proofing process. We will also be able to lock down a final printing/shipping calendar, and this information will be passed along to all customers. After that, regular updates will be posted to keep everyone informed of the progress.• WHAT’S THE TOTAL COST?The complete, direct cost of production will be $75,000. However, a previous crowd funding campaign and pre-orders through my website has covered most of that direct cost. This campaign goal is smaller and is intended to cap the final costs, as well as spread the word to (hopefully) a fresh audience. I hope that you will support what promises to be a spectacular limited edition boxed-set.• HOW WILL THE PROCEEDS BE USED?As stated, the layouts themselves are complete, and the previous campaign covered software updates and other interim expenses. This “supplemental” campaign is one final effort to make the project available to those who may not have known about it, and thus help round off final costs.• WHAT DO YOU GET?Each copy of each volume will be accompanied by an attractive Bookplate signed by both the Author, Mike Hankin, and the Publisher, Ernest Farino (shown directly below, with temporary printed signature for display purposes).
• WHAT IF YOU ALREADY HAVE ONE OR MOREOF THE VOLUMES…?
Don’t you hate it when you feel like you have to buy a new edition of a movie on DVD because there is one more special feature...? Me, too. So, to that end, an attractive, fully laid-out perfect-bound softcover book will be made available containing all of the corrections and new information and photos for those people who already have one or more of the volumes. In other words, you don’t have to buy the complete books all over again just to get the new material and corrections.    (*Note: On the website chart, this book is referred to as “the PDF” as it was originally planned as a downloadable document.)    The new “boxed set” will come in an attractive slip case. This, too, will be offered separately if you already have one or more of the volumes.• HOW DOES ALL THAT WORK IN THIS CAMPAIGN?What if, say, you only need Vol. 2? Or Vol. 3?  Can you get just the individual volume you need…?    Yes— you can just Pledge at a level that includes a “Perk” of any single volume or two volumes (without buying the whole set). Of this limited edition, the final print run will be determined by the exact number of preorders (for the box set or individual volumes).     If you already have all three books (the original editions)—    • Can you get just the slip case…?    • Can you get just the Supplement book of corrections and updates…?    “Yes” to both questions, and the “Perks” have been structured accordingly. If you already have all 3 volumes, you can pledge at a level that gets you:    • Only the slip case              —or—    • Only the Supplement book of corrections and updates              —or—    • Both the slip case and the Supplement.---------------------------------------• FURTHER REFERENCE (LINKS)In order to keep this presentation as concise as possible, I have provided links (below - scroll down further) to pages hosted on my website for further reading:    • A detailed overview of the contents and features of each of the 3 volumes    • Reviews, Customer Comments, and Interviews.     • Slideshows of sample photos    • Samples of page layoutsBelow those links are additional links to the exciting photo-montage trailers I created for Volumes 1 and 3, posted on YouTube.Thank you for taking the time to consider this project, and I hope you will support this endeavor with your pledge!Please share this campaign with your Facebook and Twitter followers.

Public and private indulgences. Weird, sexy, and a little sassy, we want to ignite adventure, youth, and voyeurism in a unique and bold way. </p>
<p><strong>So why are we launching a campaign?</strong></p>
<p>We love our digital platforms, and what it allows us to do. We love being able to give you guys daily content and communicate and collaborate with our audience in an intimate way.</p>
<p>It's the whole reason we are what we are I believe.</p>
<p>That being said: <u><strong>We want to give you guys more! </strong></u></p>

</h3>As a starting point we took the last batch of films we developed and scanned at some moment and started to compose the spreads of the future magazine. <br/>In the process we felt something started to happen, pictures started to interact with each other - by shapes, colors, meanings - some kind of weird narrative began to unroll. We finalized the sequence and we had a title, invented some funky design and put it together by our own hands. We even printed some number of copies and managed to sell some. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457999415/vv9u4y4ugbameut3raee.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>After a while we started to wonder if something was missing, we felt the urge to give it a fresh form. In the process of reworking the issue we stumbled on the Russian 
Wikipedia article on Zoos, which dazzled us with its incompleteness and 
immaturity, but had this very moving and naive touch to it, and 
surprisingly, it perfectly matched our photos.<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458001797/vgwfzigk90050riintqm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 617.012px;height: 413px;""/></p>Now we are excited and eager to share the results with you! <br/><br/>We start this campaign to print our special limited edition Zoopark Magazine #1.

We've put a lot of work and love in our product, let's make it real together!  To print Zoopark #1 without too much stress and compromises we need about 50 supporters at the very least. Let's give it a push by sharing this campaign and spreading the word, wherever possible!The #1What Is Under The Cover:32 photos / 34 pages /  uncoated paper 160 g/ metal spring binding / A4 size / digital offset printing / unique text by the anonymous and passionate author from Russian Wikipedia / and a lot of fun we had in the process      Planned Edition: 
100 copies with the texts in English + 50 copies with the texts in Russian,                   all signed and numbered by the authors.Planned Deadline for shipping pre-ordered copies and perks:May 2016.The TeamZoopark Publishing is a team of two Russian 
photographers, Tatyana Palyga and Alexander Bondar. We share the same 
passion for photography and bookmaking and while being independent 
authors we still have many things in common, share similar views and 
feel the need to act collectively to push through our vision on 
photography and modes of its circulation.   Tatyana Palyga (b. 1982) After graduating from a press photography school in Saint Petersburg, Russia in 2010 started to develop personal artistic projects and actively engaged in the field of photobooks and self-publishing. Since 2013 studying in the Master of Arts program in J.E. Purkyne University in Usti nad Labem, Czech republic. Currently based in Paris, France, studying photography in the University Paris 8. Her works took part in exhibitions in Russia, Great Britain, Italy, Czech Republic and photobooks were shown in the festivals and exhibitions all around the world. Alexander Bondar (b. 1982)Since 2007 works on personal 
photography projects. Studied in a press photography school in Saint 
Petersburg. In 2013 entered MA program in J.E. Purkyne 
University in Usti and Labem, Czech Republic. In 2014-15 studied in Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts in Poland. His 
personal interests lie in the field of photography, bookmaking, graphic 
arst and graphic design. Currently based in Usti nad Labem, Czech 
Republic.Previously, even before officially united as the Zoopark Publishing collective we've been actively engaged in the creating and producing self-published photobooks which took part in numerous festivals, competitions and book fairs all over the world.The Concept of the Magazine The key idea of the Zoopark Magazine - to take very diverse pictures belonging to both of us and to put them in a new context of the magazine, mixing them up with each other and also with text, illustration, drawing, whatever - you name it! During the years of our photography practice we have accumulated a truly huge amount of pictures that do not necessarily belong to any specific project or series. We felt it is time to share some part of it with the world, and that's how the magazine was born.The Process of Creating the #1 Issue
As a starting point we took the last batch of films we developed and scanned at some moment and started to compose the spreads of the future magazine. In the process we felt something started to happen, pictures started to interact with each other - by shapes, colors, meanings - some kind of weird narrative began to unroll. We finalized the sequence and we had a title, invented some funky design and put it together by our own hands. We even printed some number of copies and managed to sell some. After a while we started to wonder if something was missing, we felt the urge to give it a fresh form. In the process of reworking the issue we stumbled on the Russian 
Wikipedia article on Zoos, which dazzled us with its incompleteness and 
immaturity, but had this very moving and naive touch to it, and 
surprisingly, it perfectly matched our photos.Now we are excited and eager to share the results with you! We start this campaign to print our special limited edition Zoopark Magazine #1. You have a chance to become a part of our team and at the same time acquire a very special object. Let’s be partners! And of course don't miss a chance to get our unique perks.PerksTake a look and find your favorite one!

During the years we were working on our independent personal projects and after some accounting was done we realized that we have about 15 titles for which we have printed dummies already, not even speaking about the ideas for the future ones. So our goal is to realize them step by step, hopefully, also with your support. The next one, Zoopark #2, is being made in collaboration with the illustration artist Monika Dolezalova and tells the story about our everyday life in Czech Republic.

<h3>What is Music Theory You Can Use?</h3>
<p>In sitting down to find a way to properly introduce this book I am finding that, for the most part, my words escape me.  For those of you who watched me grow up under my father's instruction and care you may find this, shall we say, unusual.  I have long been known as a woman of many words.  So I will speak a bit about my family, and why we have come to fall in love with the guitar.</p>
<p>I began playing the guitar in 1989, at the age of seven.  To this day, it remains the most exciting and magical thing I have ever seen.  The first time I picked the instrument up, it became an essential part of who I am, and who I will be for the rest of my life.  As young as I was, I had to have one, I had to learn to play, and I had to be GREAT.</p>
<p>My name is Lily Maase.  I am a guitarist and educator who has made a lifelong commitment to the craft of not just playing the guitar, but teaching it.  But beyond this, I am Steve Maase's daughter.  And as a result I am coming humbly to you, my fellow guitarist and student of music, with the legacy of a truly brilliant human being.</p>
<p>I spoke to my father for the last time on the afternoon of September 30, 2016, when he called to let me know he was about to hand in the final details for this book: various photographs, album covers and newspaper clippings that comprised the personal details of Steve's early life and career as a guitarist.  We chatted briefly about his health (finally stable, after a brief bout with cancer three years prior) and next steps for the book (over twenty years in the making, it was almost done!), and made plans to speak the following day.  This was the last conversation we ever had.</p>
<p>My father had turned 70 just two weeks prior, and had gotten in the habit of telling just about anyone who would listen that he intended to have his hands on his instrument until the day he died.  I am happy to report to the people that knew and admired him that this was in fact the case; we learned of his passing because he was expected to perform at a club in downtown Albuquerque the evening of October 1st and never arrived.  He had gone quietly in his sleep early that morning, his life's work finally finished and ready to share with the world.</p>
<p>Steve was the hardest-working person I have ever known, and yet he maintained that he had never worked a day in his life.  At the peak of his career, I shadowed him at his studio as he taught 85-90 weekly students in half-hour increments; worked as a session guitarist recording jingles for national ad agencies and guitar solos for regional pop and gospel groups; spent hours in his workshop repairing electric and acoustic versions of the instrument; and, after all that, spent most weekend evenings onstage with a variety of bands, each of which rounded out the night at a local club with a minimum of three 60-minute sets.</p>
<p>My father is perhaps the most perfect representation of what the guitar means in every way.  Here is a man who never went to music school--a man who taught himself to play beautifully and then, looking at what he learned, figured out how to take this information and share it with others.  He did this selflessly, joyfully, and arguably at the expense of his own recognition and fame.  Here, also, is a man who came up through the tradition of the instrument as that tradition was created, who had brushes with fame alongside Buddy Holly, who remembered the earliest Fender amplifiers and guitars, who took the time to look at the guitar as it ascended into the pantheons of popular culture and ask an essential question: how does all this really work, and why?</p>
<p>When he was behind his instrument, Steve was a force of nature.  But the thing that strikes me most upon reflection is the fact that, in his daily life, he was a flawlessly gentle and giving human being.  He is unique, perhaps, in his conviction that the information that led to his successes also belonged to everyone he met along the way.</p>
<p>This book is a representation of all these things.  In it you will find the beginnings of a personal memoir, not just of Steve's life but of the humble beginnings of popular music in the 1950s and 1960s.  You will find an explanation of music theory so simple and so complete that, once you have worked your way through the material in the order that Steve suggested, it will seem bizarre that you did not have a mastery of this information all along.  You will also find, in pursuing this knowledge, that you are left with more questions than answers, and that Steve's story leaves off at a point where it is certain there are still many things ahead.</p>
<p>This is where I come into the picture, for this book was intended not to be the completion of a story but the beginning.  Steve left behind copious notes for a second book, and outlines for several books to follow.  I fully intend to use these notes and the success of this first publication to complete Steve's unfinished sequels and help them see the light of day.  As you come to know me, I trust that you will see beyond a doubt that my father has taught me well.</p>
<p>One of the last things Steve said to me was this: ""I am interested in teaching students, but at this point in my life I am more interested in teaching teachers how to teach.""  If you are a student of the instrument, I am convinced beyond a doubt that this book and its successors will give you access to the tools you need to continue on your personal journey of discovery.  If you are a teacher like myself, it is my hope that you will come to see my father's work as the foundation for a tried-and-true method that will assist you as you endeavor to guide your students toward success.</p>
<p>Sincerest thanks to all of you who knew the inimitable Steve Maase and have entrusted me with the task of honoring the legacy of a truly remarkable man.  I look forward to continuing to share a life of music and learning with you all.</p>
<p>With love,</p>
<p>Lily Maase, guitarist</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>20 years after the first draft of this book saw the light of day, Music Theory You Can Use is finished, laid out and ready to print!  Presales for the first edition of this amazing guitarists' manual will go toward providing a stipend for the design team who donated their time and expertise in order to save this project after my father's untimely passing left my own life in a bit of disarray.  Additional funds will go toward a publicity campaign designed to share Steve's method and enthusiasm for the instrument with the world, and toward staffing and infrastructure to develop the plans Steve left behind--two followup books and two apps to help guide emerging guitarists as they grow.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>This campaign is the only place to pre-order Music Theory You Can Use before it becomes available to the public in mid-September.  We will do everything within our power to get you a physical copy before the official release date.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>In addition to ""early bird"" access to the book, we are also providing exclusive access to the following things from the family ""guitar vault"":<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>some or all of Steve's extensive transcription catalogue, amassed over decades of teaching private students.  Steve had an incredible ear and we have well over 2,000 pieces of music digitally archived and ready to make available</li>
<li>previously-unreleased live and studio recordings, as well as demos and lead sheets for some of Steve's original tunes</li>
<li>signed prints of the cover artwork, which was hand-drawn on commission by New Mexico-based illustrator Marcelo Gallegos</li>
<li>enrollment in Steve's classic theory class, taught by yours truly (New York only)</li>
<li>a limited number of private lessons (available in New Mexico, New York, or via Skype)</li>
<li> a limited number of private house concerts (available in New Mexico and New York only)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>One of my father's students recently said to me, ""Your dad stands head and shoulders above the entire planet.""  As the weeks and months have passed, I have become increasingly aware of the incredibly personal impact my father had on just about everyone his music touched.</p>
<p>One thing that each of us who were lucky enough to study with Steve will tell you--the method works!  It really, truly does.  I have seen his approach unlock the mysteries of the instrument for SO MANY guitarists!  I am truly inspired by the notion that this information might be able to aid emerging players for generations to come.</p>
<p>If this book reaches a wide enough audience, I will be able to set aside the time and resources to complete the rest of his unfinished work.  It would mean the world to me to be able to dedicate this phase of my adult life to finishing the things my father couldn't.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have been in the music business as a performer, bandleader, venue manager, educator, tour manager, booking agent, recording artist and proprietor of a school.  This is my first time releasing a print book, but not my first time growing a beautiful project from the seeds of an idea into something capable of reaching thousands.  In the nine months since I inherited this project, I have learned just how resourceful I can be at this point in my career.  I did not expect to be the sole proprietor of a publishing company, a guitar school, and a tribute band at this point in my career.  Yet, I am looking past the sadness of this sudden loss with a certain amount of joy--20 years after I saw the first draft of this book, the rest of the world is finally going to be able to meet my amazing, infinitely capable, incredibly brilliant father.  I am turning to the village of people who knew Steve for support so we can work together to preserve his work and share it with the community of guitarists across the globe.</p>
<p> </p>

20 years after the first draft of this book saw the light of day, Music Theory You Can Use is finished, laid out and ready to print!  Presales for the first edition of this amazing guitarists' manual will go toward providing a stipend for the design team who donated their time and expertise in order to save this project after my father's untimely passing left my own life in a bit of disarray.  Additional funds will go toward a publicity campaign designed to share Steve's method and enthusiasm for the instrument with the world, and toward staffing and infrastructure to develop the plans Steve left behind--two followup books and two apps to help guide emerging guitarists as they grow.
 
This campaign is the only place to pre-order Music Theory You Can Use before it becomes available to the public in mid-September.  We will do everything within our power to get you a physical copy before the official release date.
 
In addition to ""early bird"" access to the book, we are also providing exclusive access to the following things from the family ""guitar vault"":
some or all of Steve's extensive transcription catalogue, amassed over decades of teaching private students.  Steve had an incredible ear and we have well over 2,000 pieces of music digitally archived and ready to make available
previously-unreleased live and studio recordings, as well as demos and lead sheets for some of Steve's original tunes
signed prints of the cover artwork, which was hand-drawn on commission by New Mexico-based illustrator Marcelo Gallegos
enrollment in Steve's classic theory class, taught by yours truly (New York only)
a limited number of private lessons (available in New Mexico, New York, or via Skype)
 a limited number of private house concerts (available in New Mexico and New York only)


 

The Impact
One of my father's students recently said to me, ""Your dad stands head and shoulders above the entire planet.""  As the weeks and months have passed, I have become increasingly aware of the incredibly personal impact my father had on just about everyone his music touched.
One thing that each of us who were lucky enough to study with Steve will tell you--the method works!  It really, truly does.  I have seen his approach unlock the mysteries of the instrument for SO MANY guitarists!  I am truly inspired by the notion that this information might be able to aid emerging players for generations to come.
If this book reaches a wide enough audience, I will be able to set aside the time and resources to complete the rest of his unfinished work.  It would mean the world to me to be able to dedicate this phase of my adult life to finishing the things my father couldn't.
 

Risks & Challenges
I have been in the music business as a performer, bandleader, venue manager, educator, tour manager, booking agent, recording artist and proprietor of a school.  This is my first time releasing a print book, but not my first time growing a beautiful project from the seeds of an idea into something capable of reaching thousands.  In the nine months since I inherited this project, I have learned just how resourceful I can be at this point in my career.  I did not expect to be the sole proprietor of a publishing company, a guitar school, and a tribute band at this point in my career.  Yet, I am looking past the sadness of this sudden loss with a certain amount of joy--20 years after I saw the first draft of this book, the rest of the world is finally going to be able to meet my amazing, infinitely capable, incredibly brilliant father.  I am turning to the village of people who knew Steve for support so we can work together to preserve his work and share it with the community of guitarists across the globe.

<p>There is a silent killer that most of us seem to ignore. It’s spread knows no earthly bound, and it’s reach stretches back beyond measurable time. It comes in many varieties, and afflicts all types of people. And despite its danger, and despite its incredible age, we are still studying it, and changing our opinions on what it is, and how to prevent and cure it. This silent killer is mental illness, and chances are you or someone you know is familiar with it.</p> <p>My name is J. Vonn Fritz, a Metro Detroit born activist, and this is the social edition of 105 Haiku. In a similar fashion to our labor focused editions, I searched across America, physically and digitally, to do interviews with those afflicted with mental illness, and asked as many as I can to write haiku about what frustrates them the most, and what they’d like to see changed (for frustration is the first step towards change). The point of this series is to give people a louder voice, especially those we often take for granted. Within this book is all the haiku that I’ve collected, separated by mental illness, and illustrated by Richy Benson. At the very end I have advice, based on my interviews, on how to make life better for those afflicted by mental illness.</p>
<h3>In making this project a reality you will help in spreading awareness about issues that people face with mental health. There are a lot of obstacles that they face, and they have a lot to say about how tings could get better. This book will give 20% of all future profit to Mental Health Charities, so you will be changing the world. </h3>
