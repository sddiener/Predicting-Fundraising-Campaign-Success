<p>“We live in an aspirational world.

<p>Sometimes it is not easy to let go of the beautiful glossy paper magazines that for decades have enhanced our lives.</p>
<p>Those magazines have shaped our lives, telling us what to wear, what to eat, what to think about ourselves and the world around us. How many of you are still standing in front of a shelf of magazines, browsing, wishing you had a chair to sit and forget about everything, hoping the salesperson will not come and ask “how can I help?”.</p>
<p>Printed media is reinventing itself online and as we live a disruptive time, we need to innovate and adapt to the way consumers interact with mobile technology.</p>

<p>We offer our readers a beautiful collection of 18 Magazines to submerge into a relaxed experience and savor “the magazine moment”, as we did for decades with glossy paper magazines.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE FUNDS</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our goal is that <b>Gildshire</b> Magazines will identify with the readers’ interests to develop a personal relationship, and take our Collection on the plane or by the beach, like they did with glossy paper magazines. We are asking for your support not only to pledge funds, but become part of our community and spread the word through your social media.</p>
<p>Every dollar we receive will go towards funding further content and expand program offerings, as well as enhancing the design.</p>
<p>For each magazine we will bring updated news stories and featured articles, editorials, analysis and videos.</p>
<p>Our Collection of 18 Magazines will be full of information, “what’s in” and “what’s out”, enabling our readers to stay up-to-date on trends, dress better and maintain a healthy lifestyle.</p>

“We live in an aspirational world. Magazines play a very important role in those kind of cues of how to dress, how to entertain, how to travel and have that good life that everyone on the planet seems to want to have” - David Carey, the President of Hearst Magazines, March 2016.

WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORTGildshire is the product of our work and passion to deliver. The company was funded with our savings and from family contributions, hard work and part-time jobs.Our Magazines are 100% people funded. We have 50 days to raise $85,000 and with your help we can do it! We need your support to carry on, fulfill a dream and give back to thousands of loyal readers a product to enjoy.Culture, tradition and positive thinking matter, in our magazines there is no place for negativity or sensationalism.  WHAT IS GILDSHIRE
The idea of Gildshire Collection of Magazine (Gildshire.com) has come from the love of glossy paper magazines and the realization that we cannot stop the progress of technology and media will continue to move online.
Sometimes it is not easy to let go of the beautiful glossy paper magazines that for decades have enhanced our lives.
Those magazines have shaped our lives, telling us what to wear, what to eat, what to think about ourselves and the world around us. How many of you are still standing in front of a shelf of magazines, browsing, wishing you had a chair to sit and forget about everything, hoping the salesperson will not come and ask “how can I help?”.
Printed media is reinventing itself online and as we live a disruptive time, we need to innovate and adapt to the way consumers interact with mobile technology.


We offer our readers a beautiful collection of 18 Magazines to submerge into a relaxed experience and savor “the magazine moment”, as we did for decades with glossy paper magazines.
WHAT WE WILL DO WITH THE FUNDS

Our goal is that Gildshire Magazines will identify with the readers’ interests to develop a personal relationship, and take our Collection on the plane or by the beach, like they did with glossy paper magazines. We are asking for your support not only to pledge funds, but become part of our community and spread the word through your social media.
Every dollar we receive will go towards funding further content and expand program offerings, as well as enhancing the design.
For each magazine we will bring updated news stories and featured articles, editorials, analysis and videos.
Our Collection of 18 Magazines will be full of information, “what’s in” and “what’s out”, enabling our readers to stay up-to-date on trends, dress better and maintain a healthy lifestyle.



We will bring new ideas and help with tips for gardening, organizing the house or offering information for traveling, exercising and staying in shape.



On our main Global Page we have a button that connects our readers with a charity organization. With the help of our readers and their proposals, all 18 Magazines will have a charity button, and as we grow we are committed to give back and help our community.


HOW YOU CAN HELP

Our business is located in San Diego, California and with our rewards will give something back to our supporters to remind them about this experience.
We are happy to offer small presents from San Diego, from a T-shirt or a Calendar, to tickets to Sea World or the famous San Diego Zoo. We are also inviting businesses to make this journey and grow together, advertise and be featured in the Gildshire Collection.
We very much appreciate your support to bring Gildshire.com to more readers around the world!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Rachel and I are Acupuncture physicians. We started looking for a device that we could give to patients as a way for them alert us when they needed help. We found that the devices that already exist had limitations that we weren’t willing to deal with: poor range, noisy, expensive, complicated etc. As huge believers in simplicity we knew that there could be a better way. The wheels began to turn and soon the concept for the <strong>Room8 </strong>button was born.</p>
<h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493738111/aac0qlviwbadmeyy9rue.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>The Button</h3>
<p>Our concept was simple - a device that when activated sends an alert to mobile devices<strong> </strong>via WiFi without the need for extra hardware, software or subscriptions. We took this concept to <a href=""http://www.jayconsystems.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jaycon</a> Systems and in a matter of weeks they delivered our working prototype!</p>
<h3>The App</h3>
<p>The <strong>Room8</strong> <i>can</i> work with mobile devices and computers without an app but we decided that the app would enhance the user experience. The app acts as the user interface where the button can be configured, customized and even controlled. Other useful features such as: a treatment timer to keep track of multiple patient treatments at a time and a location feature for locating misplaced buttons will be incorporated into the app as well.</p>

<h3>What We Need  </h3>
<p>At this point the <strong>Room8</strong> is a working prototype, is patent pending and trademarked. We have a manufacturer and an app developer and our goal is to get funded so we can get a first round of  buttons out. Our backers will be the first to get their hands on the buttons and the app. We will begin taking orders for subsequent button batches after our first batch runs out. There is much more that needs to happen before and after we get there but here is what we need to get started:</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Rachel and I are Acupuncture physicians. We started looking for a device that we could give to patients as a way for them alert us when they needed help. We found that the devices that already exist had limitations that we weren’t willing to deal with: poor range, noisy, expensive, complicated etc. As huge believers in simplicity we knew that there could be a better way. The wheels began to turn and soon the concept for the Room8 button was born.

The Button
Our concept was simple - a device that when activated sends an alert to mobile devices via WiFi without the need for extra hardware, software or subscriptions. We took this concept to Jaycon Systems and in a matter of weeks they delivered our working prototype!
The App
The Room8 can work with mobile devices and computers without an app but we decided that the app would enhance the user experience. The app acts as the user interface where the button can be configured, customized and even controlled. Other useful features such as: a treatment timer to keep track of multiple patient treatments at a time and a location feature for locating misplaced buttons will be incorporated into the app as well.

What We Need  
At this point the Room8 is a working prototype, is patent pending and trademarked. We have a manufacturer and an app developer and our goal is to get funded so we can get a first round of  buttons out. Our backers will be the first to get their hands on the buttons and the app. We will begin taking orders for subsequent button batches after our first batch runs out. There is much more that needs to happen before and after we get there but here is what we need to get started:

If we do not meet our funding goal our objective is to find the means to deliver the perks/rewards promised to our backers regardless!

<h2>Restart NOW, Save Our Jobs</h2>
<p><strong>A data-driven approach to saving lives, livelihoods and our economic future</strong></p>
<p>It's currently lights-off for much of our country and the world, a first in human history. The Coronavirus is real, but the steps taken to prevent the spread and loss of life are truly damaging, with over <strong>22 MILLION</strong> people having already lost their livelihoods as a result of the shelter-in-place directives by local and state governments, even where the virus has barely registered.</p>
<p>In the last 3 years alone the fastest growing small businesses were minority, veteran and women-owned. Now, they're all losing their dreams. Suicide hotlines are spiking to levels we've never witnessed. Without scientific basis, parks and recreation places are being closed. Stress levels in the unemployed are and will cause many of them lifelong health issues.</p>
<p>The sun is shining in America, spring is here, and we need to Save Livelihoods.</p>
<p>We need to know where to <strong><i>restart</i></strong> today.</p>
<p>We need to act <strong><i>now</i></strong>.</p>
<p>Join Restart NOW!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Data-driven Approach</strong></h3>
<p>We're using big data analytics to show how the rich diversity of our country's social and economic communities can allow us to safely restart the economy on a county by county level, as well as specific industry-focused risk factors. In America, one size <i>does not</i> fit all.</p>

<p>Our goal is to educate every American citizen with knowledge of the harm, and the need to restart across the entire USA.

Poverty must be fought to Save Livelihoods.</p>
<p>Your support helps us get America back to work, and sends a message to the White House and the US Capitol that we Americans agree - <strong>it's time </strong>to Restart NOW!</p>

<h3><strong>Who Are We?</strong></h3>
<p>We're a data analysis risk company. Among other things, we support and provide tools to help protect people who travel for work, volunteer for NGOs, and non-profits. To date, our customers have visited and used our protective tools in over 95 countries around the globe.</p>
<p>Now we've turned our focus inward, to our homeland. We have significant economic modeling experience from working on Department of Defense and other workforce initiatives. We value every business owner in our communities, and don't want to see anyone else losing their jobs or dreams as a result of this virus. We're devoting every penny and every minute to powering on our communities, our industries, and lighting the way forward for the world.</p>

<p><br/>In 2017, our first project, the Cubiio that started it all, was the <span>most funded fabrication tool</span> ever on Kickstarter.

<h1>Metal Engraving</h1>
<p>Thanks to the latest advances in semiconductor laser technology, our laser cartridge works on stainless steel directly, without pre-coating spray. Cubiio 2 can engrave on titanium, dark glass, shale, brick, concrete, most varieties of colored anodized aluminum, and other materials. It even works on curved surfaces, like wine bottles.  </p>

<h1>What Can Be Cut?</h1>
<p>Cubiio 2 can cut through paper, wood, leather, fabric, felt, cardboard, non-transparent acrylic, and many other materials. If the work material is too thick for a single pass to cut through, Cubiio 2 will continue to focus downward into the material for subsequent passes. The maximum cutting thickness is 5 mm.     </p>

<h1>Excellent Resolution</h1>
<p>Cubiio 2 outputs at a resolution of 500 DPI or 0.05 mm. That’s even thinner than your hair! In contrast to PWM control, our “realtime analog control” of laser power produces a wide range of gray tones. With Cubiio 2, your laser portrait is not only black and white.  </p>

<p>Thanks to LiDAR, some high-end smartphones are now equipped with 3D cameras.

<p><b>Why We Do It?</b> Vendedy is dubbed the “Etsy on the go for travelers”. The founder is the daughter of 3 generations of Haitian female street vendors. Her mother continued the tradition in the streets and flea markets of New York City until she opened a boutique in 1998.  Haiti’s earthquake of 2010 disrupted supply access to artisan designs and led to an abrupt shut down of the business. The concept of Vendedy was born post this loss as the founder walked through the Haitian Capital only to find vendors on top of rubble and trash street vending for survival. It was at that moment that she pursued a 5 year agenda to digitize the industry and make it a global conduit of prosperity. <strong style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our Impact:</strong><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> With research across 30 countries, and on the ground beta launches in the favelas of Brazil and the streets of Haiti our Vendors were grossing up to 14X times their annual income in a matter of weeks.</span></p>

Its designed to help you move closer to your goals and keep you away from negative thinking and built to help you manifest a thriving life. Huge claims, eh?</p><p>Researchers estimate that we think about 50,000 to 70,000 thoughts a day – and about 80% of those thoughts are negative. That is a crazy amount of negative self-talk that can really take a toll on our mental health!</p><p>As Artists and Creatives, this negative self-talk is on a whole other level. Our pursuit of creative careers comes with marrying negative thoughts &amp; giving birth to negative self-talk. Over time, this child can spiral out of control and become an insurmountable roadblock to joy.</p><p>But when we choose to think and speak positively despite the nature of our circumstances, we give ourselves authority to create moments of optimism, which can help improve our outlook towards life and inspire positivity to the people around us.</p><p>Words are the most powerful force available to humanity. With practice, declaring positive words of life (aka affirmations) can disrupt and overcome negative thoughts. Now, integrate that with action, and you get momentum that leads to tangible results.</p><p>It has been found that there was a strong connection between positive thinking and overall life satisfaction in the population. Scientists working at the Institute of Neurology in London discovered that people who visualize a better future are more likely to be able to bring that future into existence.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602083575/ejdzlfmkzdsxd645xpuo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Umm...</strong></h3><p>Okay, let’s say you set your mind the night before to wake up early and start your day right.

An hour later…you’re <strong><u>still</u></strong> in bed, your eyes scoring through your Instagram feed. You’re now lost in time, weighing your worth against this person who happens to have more than you—money, acclaim, looks, whatever, you name it.</p><p>Here’s another – you have been burying your head in your creative project for the past 3 hours. You hear your phone buzz and you notice that your friend just texted you. She just got the thing that she wanted, the thing that you have been working so hard at, for the past three months! The thing! Whatever that thing is. Training? Writing? Filmmaking? Oh, Boyfriend?!</p><p>Boy, there are so many things we want to do but someone is just always better than us, always winning! And we are out here constantly trying to match up to that someone else’s accomplishments. How exhausting, isn’t it?</p><p>The spike of envy your social media platforms can trigger is natural, and they are primed to amp it up.

</ul><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""> </p><h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</strong></h2><ul>
<li>
<strong>How do I choose my Surprise! Affirmation Statement?</strong><br/>You don’t. That’s why it’s called a Surprise! Affirmation Statement. Even though it’s randomly picked, believe that the statement you receive is truly meant for the season you’re currently in.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do the charities get the same deck of AffirmActions</strong><strong>™</strong><strong> that we do?</strong><br/>Of course! No exclusions! No exceptions! They deserve the best, too.</li>
<li>
<strong>What are you going to do with the money you raise?</strong><br/>Once we reach our goal, we'll make your decks and ship them to you as quickly as possible. And for every three decks purchased, we deliver a deck to a homeless young adult so they can continue to dream and achieve in life. Any additional funds raised will go towards continued production and expansion of the current line to include decks for Kids &amp; Teens, Pass-it-on Affirmation Cards, unique Affirmation Journals, as well as few extra surprises.</li>
<li>
<strong>When do I get my purchase?</strong><br/>Our manufacturing partners are standing by and excited to start producing. As soon as our campaign ends, they will get to work. Allowing for 20 days to receive the funds we raised we can expect to have your purchases delivered to you within 1 month after the end of the campaign. But we will do everything within our control to expedite the process to get them to you as soon as possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Will the cards tear?</strong><br/>Never. Because they’re made of premium quality PVC plastic, hence exceptionally durable.</li>
<li>
<strong>Will the colors on the card fade?</strong><br/>Highly, extremely, surely not.</li>
<li>
<strong>What if I don't like them?</strong><br/>Unlikely, but stranger things have happened. That said, we stand by our product 100% so if for any reason you aren't happy with your purchases, just reach out to us at <a href=""mailto:info@affirmationdarling.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@affirmationdarling.com</a> and we'll arrange for an exchange or full return.</li>
<li>
<strong>What do I do if I feel led to pass on an AffirmAction card to a friend in need but I don’t want to because I need it, too?</strong><br/>Don't panic, you're not alone. The only answer to your question is to get an additional deck of cards so you have enough AffirmActions™ on hand to be able to pass on in singles. You can also gift it as an add-on. Happy Birthday! Happy Holidays!</li>
<li>
<strong>What do I do if throngs of people follow me and try to steal my cards?</strong><br/>Not surprising. We've seen it happen. Your significant other will steal your AffirmActions™. Regardless, your cards will go missing or get misplaced if you're not careful. Don’t say we didn’t warn you. The only solution here is to make sure these people have their own decks. AffirmActions™ are cool enough to make for excellent gifts. Remember, they last a whole lot longer than cardstock or paper affirmations.  And hey, you'll be helping someone less fortunate in the process, so win/win all around.</li>
<li>
<strong>What's this whole ""Speak. Act. Thrive. Repeat"" thing about?</strong><br/>When we say Speak. Act. Thrive. Repeat, we mean it as a mantra, our way of approaching any affirmation. It's the first card of our AffirmActions™ deck for a reason. It's a reminder that the next time you have a negative thought, declare a positive affirmation over yourself, and take action to make it happen. Then, you thrive baby, you just thrive! Because you are moving forward. And remember to repeat the whole exercise if and when the negative thought returns, or a new thought sprouts up. Also, a reminder that you helped someone in need with your purchase. And a reminder that we're all connected through words, and powerful affirmations &amp; small actions can add up to make a big difference.</li>

Your. Eyes. On AffirmActions™, the nicest-looking, Affirmation cards out there.
Naw! Honestly, it’s the yummiest and glossiest looking Affirmation cards out anywhere! As you can see by the name of the deck, it’s more than just Affirmations. It also has Actions! Because affirmations alone would be blah! So we decided to combine them both. And got a bit clever with the name. Say hello to AffirmActions™.  We interrupt your serious reading for an unnecessary but essential commercial break.Your contribution with us is a guaranteed purchase. That means if you order a deck of our AffirmActions™ with us, you will get the deck of our AffirmActions™ from us. In other words – Delivery Guaranteed. Back to your regularly scheduled reading...  So what is AffirmActions™?Affirmactions™ is a pocket-sized life coach but cheaper than therapy. Its designed to help you move closer to your goals and keep you away from negative thinking and built to help you manifest a thriving life. Huge claims, eh?Researchers estimate that we think about 50,000 to 70,000 thoughts a day – and about 80% of those thoughts are negative. That is a crazy amount of negative self-talk that can really take a toll on our mental health!As Artists and Creatives, this negative self-talk is on a whole other level. Our pursuit of creative careers comes with marrying negative thoughts & giving birth to negative self-talk. Over time, this child can spiral out of control and become an insurmountable roadblock to joy.But when we choose to think and speak positively despite the nature of our circumstances, we give ourselves authority to create moments of optimism, which can help improve our outlook towards life and inspire positivity to the people around us.Words are the most powerful force available to humanity. With practice, declaring positive words of life (aka affirmations) can disrupt and overcome negative thoughts. Now, integrate that with action, and you get momentum that leads to tangible results.It has been found that there was a strong connection between positive thinking and overall life satisfaction in the population. Scientists working at the Institute of Neurology in London discovered that people who visualize a better future are more likely to be able to bring that future into existence.  Umm...Okay, let’s say you set your mind the night before to wake up early and start your day right. Sun rises and you turn off your alarm. So far so good. Then you see a couple of notifications and you unlock your screen to read them. An hour later…you’re still in bed, your eyes scoring through your Instagram feed. You’re now lost in time, weighing your worth against this person who happens to have more than you—money, acclaim, looks, whatever, you name it.Here’s another – you have been burying your head in your creative project for the past 3 hours. You hear your phone buzz and you notice that your friend just texted you. She just got the thing that she wanted, the thing that you have been working so hard at, for the past three months! The thing! Whatever that thing is. Training? Writing? Filmmaking? Oh, Boyfriend?!Boy, there are so many things we want to do but someone is just always better than us, always winning! And we are out here constantly trying to match up to that someone else’s accomplishments. How exhausting, isn’t it?The spike of envy your social media platforms can trigger is natural, and they are primed to amp it up. But you don't have to take the bait anymore!AffirmActions™ is here to tell you that you are better, you are worthy, you are smart, you are creative, you are talented, you are ENOUGH!AffirmActions™ is designed to help you shift your negative mindset even before it takes shape in your mind. Cultivate a routine where you set your intention for the day by choosing an affirmation that resonates with your To-Do’s or your mood for the day. You can also hand-pick an affirmation by its highlighted word to reset your intention whenever you find yourself going down that rabbit hole of negative thoughts.So, the next time you have a negative thought, declare a positive affirmation over yourself; follow the action steps behind the card to get your mind motivated; and thrive, knowing that you’re moving forward. Repeat if the negative thought returns or a new thought sprouts up.Speak → Act → Thrive → Repeat  What makes AffirmActions™ different from all other Affirmation cards out there?Like another Affirmation cards, we are one, too BUT we also come with a detailed Action plan to help you manifest that thriving life you have been desiring. It’s time to ditch those cards that only have Affirmations on them. Boring. Bleh! Pair them with actions and voila – you get affirmations that work. Actually work. If you're wondering how we are making such bold claims, skip to ""So, what makes us qualified to make these cards?""  
So, who is AffirmActions™ for?
This is for you if –
You are an Artist/Creative who believes in the power of positive affirmations.
You are not an Artist/Creative but believe in the power of positive affirmations.
You are not a big believer in positive affirmations but you’re curious.

How do I choose my Surprise! Affirmation Statement?You don’t. That’s why it’s called a Surprise! Affirmation Statement. Even though it’s randomly picked, believe that the statement you receive is truly meant for the season you’re currently in.

Do the charities get the same deck of AffirmActions™ that we do?Of course! No exclusions! No exceptions! They deserve the best, too.

What are you going to do with the money you raise?Once we reach our goal, we'll make your decks and ship them to you as quickly as possible. And for every three decks purchased, we deliver a deck to a homeless young adult so they can continue to dream and achieve in life. Any additional funds raised will go towards continued production and expansion of the current line to include decks for Kids & Teens, Pass-it-on Affirmation Cards, unique Affirmation Journals, as well as few extra surprises.

When do I get my purchase?Our manufacturing partners are standing by and excited to start producing. As soon as our campaign ends, they will get to work. Allowing for 20 days to receive the funds we raised we can expect to have your purchases delivered to you within 1 month after the end of the campaign. But we will do everything within our control to expedite the process to get them to you as soon as possible.

Will the cards tear?Never. Because they’re made of premium quality PVC plastic, hence exceptionally durable.

Will the colors on the card fade?Highly, extremely, surely not.

What if I don't like them?Unlikely, but stranger things have happened. That said, we stand by our product 100% so if for any reason you aren't happy with your purchases, just reach out to us at info@affirmationdarling.com and we'll arrange for an exchange or full return.

What do I do if I feel led to pass on an AffirmAction card to a friend in need but I don’t want to because I need it, too?Don't panic, you're not alone. The only answer to your question is to get an additional deck of cards so you have enough AffirmActions™ on hand to be able to pass on in singles. You can also gift it as an add-on. Happy Birthday! Happy Holidays!

What do I do if throngs of people follow me and try to steal my cards?Not surprising. We've seen it happen. Your significant other will steal your AffirmActions™. Regardless, your cards will go missing or get misplaced if you're not careful. Don’t say we didn’t warn you. The only solution here is to make sure these people have their own decks. AffirmActions™ are cool enough to make for excellent gifts. Remember, they last a whole lot longer than cardstock or paper affirmations.  And hey, you'll be helping someone less fortunate in the process, so win/win all around.

What's this whole ""Speak. Act. Thrive. Repeat"" thing about?When we say Speak. Act. Thrive. Repeat, we mean it as a mantra, our way of approaching any affirmation. It's the first card of our AffirmActions™ deck for a reason. It's a reminder that the next time you have a negative thought, declare a positive affirmation over yourself, and take action to make it happen. Then, you thrive baby, you just thrive! Because you are moving forward. And remember to repeat the whole exercise if and when the negative thought returns, or a new thought sprouts up. Also, a reminder that you helped someone in need with your purchase. And a reminder that we're all connected through words, and powerful affirmations & small actions can add up to make a big difference.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Why VITAKORA is different ? </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our main users are independent designers and artists working and selling locally, who are looking for new options but they lose business opportunities elsewhere because some of them can´t invest in their own e- commerce and others can not access to current platforms because they limit the creation of the store only to some countries.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Besides attending artists and designers from around the world our platform will create new market opportunities and new jobs in this community so it will be able to generate connections and knowledge networks and exchange of ideas that will allow them to have new visions.</span></p>
<p><b><u>Your products will not be next to uneven items</u>: </b>This is the place where the authenticity of your creations and concepts will be valued. <br/>We know designers want a place that specializes in design, where their products don´t lose value with other categories. We guarantee that all items undergo a process of curating study before being published.<br/>Your products can be physical or virtual so the group users could be extended to photographers, illustrators, etc.</p>
<p><u><b>Some platforms do not allow you to open your store bet on your location:</b></u><br/>In VITAKORA World Design District you don´t have to be worry about it. You can create your store regardless the country where you are, plus we have a system that automatically calculates shipping prices.</p>
<p><b><u>You won´t have difficulty with shipments</u> : </b>With Vitakora you get in your mail the guide already filled with the information you submitted related to the size and weight of the product to be delivered along with the package to Fedex office closer to you.  Don´t lose money making prepayments shipping anymore</p>
<p><u><b>Low Rates: </b></u><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our policy is fair trade, that is why, sales and display commissions are very low, so that way designers and artists get paid a fair price for their products so they can make money doing what  they love most.</span></p>
<p>Customers already will have better prices because they can buy directly to the designers.</p>

VITAKORADESIGN.COM is a market-place specially created for independent
designers and artists and people who love design and want to buy top-class
design products. Our goal is to build a GLOBAL SCOPE PLATFORM  to provide
an easy to use tool for designers and artists, in order to achieve their dream
of create their own shop, open new markets, and sell their products all around
the world.  Not matter where they are !!!
We want to create a community where creators and customers converge in a
creative, unique and multicultural experience. Each dollar will go toward our
outreach platform (development, announcements, marketing activities). We are a
team of design lovers, help us to fulfill the dream of building the World
Design District, an ideal venue where you can find unique stores
within which the designers can exhibit their collections to the world and
customers can find what they crave.

We are a startup and what are saying about us is…""Three young art and designed passionate friends  have created  www.vitakoradesign.com. It is a new website that provides a place for exhibition and sale high-style artistic and design products "" - Mobiliari Magazine 155 Ed.

Why VITAKORA is different ? Our main users are independent designers and artists working and selling locally, who are looking for new options but they lose business opportunities elsewhere because some of them can´t invest in their own e- commerce and others can not access to current platforms because they limit the creation of the store only to some countries.
Besides attending artists and designers from around the world our platform will create new market opportunities and new jobs in this community so it will be able to generate connections and knowledge networks and exchange of ideas that will allow them to have new visions.
Your products will not be next to uneven items: This is the place where the authenticity of your creations and concepts will be valued. We know designers want a place that specializes in design, where their products don´t lose value with other categories. We guarantee that all items undergo a process of curating study before being published.Your products can be physical or virtual so the group users could be extended to photographers, illustrators, etc.

Low Rates: Our policy is fair trade, that is why, sales and display commissions are very low, so that way designers and artists get paid a fair price for their products so they can make money doing what  they love most.
Customers already will have better prices because they can buy directly to the designers.

Many times inspirations, ideas and memories are invaluable. They come to our head randomly, if we do not write it, sometimes they leave forever. In general circumstance, it's acceptable to note important things in a notebook or sheets of paper. But in the journey time, which you cannot be certain with condition or situation, normal notebook tends to be a limit.

Jour the waterproof notebook is created for every adventure trip, which will give us 1) freedom to write or draw whenever and wherever we want. 2) peace of mind which we don't need to worry if our notes will get wet.



How it started?
It started three years ago somewhere near Zermatt, Switzerland. One day, we walked among trees , suddenly, there was a little raining. Still we carry on our walk until some point, then I saw a group of mushrooms whose forms were very interesting and gave me some ideas about table top decoration. (We designed and made some home decoration items in our business too.) But I could not pull out my notebook to sketch and write because it would get wet. In the end, I forgot the mushrooms but idea of Jour became very very clear in my mind.

So the idea of JOUR popped-up from that point.
Design Talks
To start from the most important part, paper. I found the material called stone paper which was perfect for making our dream notebook. 
To design the cover, we thought it would be great if it could get along very well with functional travelling backpack, another adventure's familiar accessory. 
Moreover, explorer's behavior when they hold the map was very inspiring. They rolled it, kept it firm touch, put it in the pocket or stuffed it in the backpack. Yes! we wanted that kind of notebook, ""it must be rolled like that"" we said.    
Most of our travels, they are  not long trips, We need not a thick - heavy notes. In contrast, we need  thin notes so we can separate a trip from another, 
It would be smarter if we can refill the note easily and keep using the same cover. 

The way the paper and the cover join together was very important, also. Since, it is supposed to be wet sometimes, they should be joint together by some technique but without glue. 

After all designs, talks, trials and errors, we got JOUR notebook as you can see below.

F O Q

Can we use any kind of pen writing on this notebook and still having waterproof attribute?
Actually any kind of pen can be used on this paper-like material. But to having waterproof attribute, it is necessary to use the pencil or pen with solvent base, like roller ball pen, or permanent ink pen.
How about writing under water?
Now as we have known, only pencil that able to do so.
What's paper-like material, what it is made from?
It is a mixture between calcium carbonate , and high density polyethylene (HDPE) . On top of waterproof characteristic, it is also tear resistant and photo-degradable.
How to buy refill in the future?
We are expanding our design and size afterward, absolutely customer can find the refill notes with in three month. And you can buy directly through our website.


Risk and Challenges
We had prepared the materials in advance, but the accident may comes if we have too small or too large quantity of support. So the shipment may be delay for  30 days due to material management. By this occurrence, every customer will be informed accordingly.

<h2><b>What is Campus Essentials? </b></h2>
<p>What started as a school project by a student just trying to receive a good grade; has turned into a real life business in order to help millions of college students. Campus Essentials is the first of its kind; C.E is a free and private social market site for college students across the United States to use as a tool to interact, buy, sell, and trade with local students in their area. We noticed that there was lack of student to student structure at every school. So Campus Essential’s wanted to fill that void to bring students together to improve their overall college experience by providing a free hub to help them save money by selling and buying books, electronics, clothing, etc. from each other, improving grades by forming study groups, uploading papers to get peer edited, and finding study guides all for free. Campus Essentials also helps students find rentals, job and internship opportunities, and so much more listed by local or national businesses. Campus Essentials is the first business to directly bridge the gap between college students and businesses.</p>
<h2>Who Are We?</h2>
<p>Campus Essentials was started by recent graduate Matt Spanburg. Matt graduated Flagler College with a bachelors in Business Administration and ever since a kid dreamed of starting his own business. For instance, in the 4th grade he showed up to his school for Halloween dressed in a suit saying when he grows up he wanted to be a business man. Throughout the years he has started a couple small companies such as a small surfboard company out of his garage with his father and a water sports school that he ran during summers in Lake of the Ozarks, but nothing as been more special to him than Campus Essentials.  The concept was derived from a school project he did in his junior year at college. The project got so much positive attention from local students that after lots of thinking, Matt decided to go through with it and take the risk knowing how it had the potential to fill the void and create a stronger student body. So with personal money and money borrowed from his family he spent two years on getting the site developed to what he thought was a perfect first version of the site. Currently Campus Essentials has been live for just over 4 months now and is run and managed by Matt solely. He spends morning to night figuring out ways to get the business going and a way to fund it. He refuses to give himself any type of a salary yet because he believes the business must eat before he does. In order to get help, Matt's always bribing friends with food and drinks to come in the office to help come up with ideas, film skits, and any other necessary tasks to take Campus Essentials in the right direction. Spanburg states ""Campus Essentials would not be what it is today without my great friends and family members giving me as much support as I need. One day I can't wait to hire and work with all the great people that have believed in me! Thank You All""  He has spent so much time and is taking all these risks because he truly believes that college students are an underappreciated group and that Campus Essentials will become a big tool one day to help students from all over. There is only so much he can do with the shoe string budget he is working with and that is why he and everyone who has helped and continues to support Campus Essentials is turning to the people he is trying to help to get help on pushing Campus Essentials into the future.</p>
<h3>Why Are We Doing A Campaign? </h3>
<p>Campus Essentials is campaigning on Indie GoGo to help raise awareness of C.E to help students and colleges from all over. With the campaign, we are wanting to help become a college tool to help the everyday lives of people apart of colleges. College is already hard enough so any help you can get as a student can make a big difference.</p>
<p><u><strong>What Will We Do With The Money Raised?</strong></u></p>
<ol>
<li>
<i>Finish our mobile app for those students on the go. Will work the exact same as our website, but with better mobile and quicker on demand features. </i><br/> </li>
<li>
<i>Continue adding powerful productive features to the site in order for students to use as college tools to even further improve their college careers. </i><br/> </li>
<li>
<i>Create portals for every college in the United States. Then after this is accomplished, go global. Starting With Canada and then going overseas. </i><br/> </li>
<li><i>Marketing costs. Marketing anything is expensive, but with a site like this it only improves the lives of others as more and more users create accounts. (More Users= More items on site) </i></li>
</ol>
<p>We have lots of new and innovative ideas to implement over time onto Campus Essentials to take it to the next level to further make even more powerful tools for students, professors, and local businesses. So we need the campaignes help to raise awareness and capital to continue on our path of helping students and to keep adding features.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Helping push C.E into the next level can open the doors for so many new opportunities for students, businesses, and faculty alike. We want to continue helping build a strong next generation of people. Now a days further education is so important and it shapes who we are as a society and we want to help create tools for people </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways We Are Helping</h3>
<p>Other ways Campus Essentials is wanting to help is that every year we are going to take 5% of profits and create scholarships for students who may not be able to financially afford to go to college. Everyone needs a chance at higher education and we want to help create as many scholarships as possible. To show our appreciation, we want to offer 3 months of FREE service advertising starting January First. Which Means businesses of all sizes can post as many job and internship opportunities, apartment rentals, restaurant specials, events, and even pet adoptions targeted to any school page of their choice by using code ""Campus123"". Campus Essential’s also knows how expensive colleges can be to run, so we want to take a stand for colleges that contact us and set up an account to receive 5% of profits from the page that represents the students that attend their school each year. For example the students of Flagler College’s page makes $50,000 profit, we want to donate $2500 to that school. </p>

</div></div>","What is Campus Essentials? 
What started as a school project by a student just trying to receive a good grade; has turned into a real life business in order to help millions of college students. Campus Essentials is the first of its kind; C.E is a free and private social market site for college students across the United States to use as a tool to interact, buy, sell, and trade with local students in their area. We noticed that there was lack of student to student structure at every school. So Campus Essential’s wanted to fill that void to bring students together to improve their overall college experience by providing a free hub to help them save money by selling and buying books, electronics, clothing, etc. from each other, improving grades by forming study groups, uploading papers to get peer edited, and finding study guides all for free. Campus Essentials also helps students find rentals, job and internship opportunities, and so much more listed by local or national businesses. Campus Essentials is the first business to directly bridge the gap between college students and businesses.
Who Are We?
Campus Essentials was started by recent graduate Matt Spanburg. Matt graduated Flagler College with a bachelors in Business Administration and ever since a kid dreamed of starting his own business. For instance, in the 4th grade he showed up to his school for Halloween dressed in a suit saying when he grows up he wanted to be a business man. Throughout the years he has started a couple small companies such as a small surfboard company out of his garage with his father and a water sports school that he ran during summers in Lake of the Ozarks, but nothing as been more special to him than Campus Essentials.  The concept was derived from a school project he did in his junior year at college. The project got so much positive attention from local students that after lots of thinking, Matt decided to go through with it and take the risk knowing how it had the potential to fill the void and create a stronger student body. So with personal money and money borrowed from his family he spent two years on getting the site developed to what he thought was a perfect first version of the site.

What Will We Do With The Money Raised?


Finish our mobile app for those students on the go. Will work the exact same as our website, but with better mobile and quicker on demand features.  

Continue adding powerful productive features to the site in order for students to use as college tools to even further improve their college careers.  

Create portals for every college in the United States. Then after this is accomplished, go global. Starting With Canada and then going overseas.  
Marketing costs. Marketing anything is expensive, but with a site like this it only improves the lives of others as more and more users create accounts. (More Users= More items on site)

<li>Management of external dependencies, like textures, 3D models, simulation data and so on.

It also needs to be updated on each computer if you change it. This feature will take care of all that automatically.</li>
<li>Convenience by having CrowdRender able to start in the background automatically when you turn on a computer and login. You won't need to launch Blender or any other application your using, turn on and go.</li>
<li>Faster and more efficient transfer of all your data. All transfers will be resumable, faster and use less bandwidth while still being secure. </li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Robustness</h3><p>The current alpha system will have a major overhaul focussing on making our system super stable, we'll ensure each job you submit gets done, even if computers get turned off or networks fail, the job will get done. Our system will keep you notified of problems so you can take action.</p><h3>What you'll get</h3><p>The complete system will allow you use computers anywhere in the world that are shared with you or that you own or control. Add them from your home, office, wherever you find them!</p><p>Plus you'll be able to boost your computing power by adding computers from the cloud.

It then configures the application you're using to process part of the project on each computer. Here's an example, rendering a frame of animation.</p><p>An image is divided into chunks called tiles, each computer renders a tile. As each tile is completed its transferred back to the computer you are working on where its immediately displayed inside the application you're using.</p><p>This is incredibly effective, by dividing an image in half, each computer has half the work and so finishes in half the time (if both computers are equally powerful). Use three computers, your render time is now reduce to a third, and so on.</p><p> </p><p>We've also designed our system to be easy to setup.

Others are to support other addons or plugins such as other render engines. </p><p>Ok, some terms and conditions. To qualify your feature needs to be something we can add to the current project, which means:</p><ul>
<li>It needs to be something we can actually do without requiring permission or help from another company or person. For example, if we need another piece of software changed to give you what you want, or enter into an agreement with that person or company, then we're not obliged to build that feature, even if you backed at this level. We will, however do our best to change it to get a similar result. </li>
<li>It needs to be something we can build on our current platform. We totally want to make software for other apps and systems in the future but right now, we're keeping this to blender, otherwise you'd be waiting ages</li>
<li>It must be an extension of our system. We can't build a new addon, or web platform or anything else. </li>
</ul><p>So please decide carefully when you pledge. If you want to check with us first, before you pledge, then please contact us at info at crowdrender dot com dot au. We'll be super happy to hear your idea and tell you straight if we're happy to build it as a perk for this campaign.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525232198/i5w5nknezpqtprqfpti8.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The main risk with this project is simply not having sufficient funds to complete it. This is always an issue to any project right? Since we're running a software project, not a hardware project, we face less problems. We have no real regulatory hurdles like physical products do. Electronic goods for example have to be safe, especially if they plug into the mains supply. So for our project the main risk we're managing is sufficient funding.</p><p>We're up to the task of managing this. We've been working on this project now for five years and we've been able to build and ship software for our alpha releases with increasing pace in over the past twelve months. Our fourth publicly available revision of the alpha is now free to download including integration with the cloud which was built with funding from a government grant and friends and family. That project came in on budget. </p><p>More importantly most of the problems we had in the developing the alpha we have today came from learning how to integrate with Blender. Our plugin for blender is now maturing and we've gained invaluable experience coding in this environment. We've now got the experience we need to develop more plugins and make the current one better. </p><p>Another important fact is that most of the features being built in the new system will be in code that we totally own and have complete control over which makes it much easier and much less risky. </p><p>So, maybe you'd like to try out the current release? You can access our latest alpha version using the link below. You'll need to also install Blender (Blender is 100% free software by the way) since the current alpha program only supports Blender, though if we reach the stretch goals we're setting we'll be able to support other applications as well!  </p><p>Our addon/plugins are/will be 100% free software! All you need to do is register with an e-mail to get access to the downloads section of our website (or use facebook or G+ to log in if you don't want to use e-mail/password to register).</p><p><a href=""https://www.crowd-render.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.crowd-render.com/</a></p><p> </p><p>Well if you made it this far down the page, we congratulate you!

A little about us, we're nerds, we love computer graphics and we're programmers :)For five years we've been working to save tons of time for anyone using computers for creative work. We got hooked on making 3D art in Blender, but we got sick of waiting for computers to render and got motivated to fix it! Here's what we came up with;A platform which is easy to use;  that plugs into your application and accelerates intensive tasks by sourcing computer power from anywhere, cloud, friends, home, office; and it updates edits in real time, avoiding long file uploads.  See it in actionIn this short video you'll see how CrowdRender can save you time rendering. This is a very early stage prototype of the Beta system at work allowing peer to peer computer sharing! CrowdRender has been in development for five years. We've grown to 1600 users and we just released the fourth revision of our alpha; and thanks to a grant we received from our government, we've built a system which lets you add powerful computers from Amazon to your own hardware whenever you need it, just like Chris demonstrated in the video above.Now we're here at last to crowd fund the development of the whole project! We need your help to finish what we started!What will it look and feel like when its finished? Imagine a platform where you can access computer power from practically anywhere on earth and then use it to make your application run faster. That's where we're headed.Backing us means backing more speed to you and what you do.So if your with us, whack your self a perk, and share this campaign with others on social media!  Would you like to know more? Check it out below...      User TestimonialsSo far the feedback from the community of users has been very positive despite the early stage of the software, here's what a couple of those people said:M.L.: ""frigging amazing addon, seriously impressive work, especially because it is so easy to use, I did encounter a few problems making my gamer PC use GPU only, my MacBook pro does not like when blender is set to GPU, I semi solved it and chopped my render from 12 min to 4min pr. render test :D.... those guys' deserve a gigantic THANK YOU for doing this project""Midge Sinnavae: “I no longer hate my slow-ass laptop when working on location. I’m able to access the power of my workstation working remotely.

This data is sometimes stored outside the project file meaning it needs to be packaged up with the project file and sent to each computer you use. It also needs to be updated on each computer if you change it. This feature will take care of all that automatically.
Convenience by having CrowdRender able to start in the background automatically when you turn on a computer and login. You won't need to launch Blender or any other application your using, turn on and go.
Faster and more efficient transfer of all your data. All transfers will be resumable, faster and use less bandwidth while still being secure. 
 RobustnessThe current alpha system will have a major overhaul focussing on making our system super stable, we'll ensure each job you submit gets done, even if computers get turned off or networks fail, the job will get done. Our system will keep you notified of problems so you can take action.What you'll getThe complete system will allow you use computers anywhere in the world that are shared with you or that you own or control. Add them from your home, office, wherever you find them!Plus you'll be able to boost your computing power by adding computers from the cloud. Your edits will be synchronised in real time to avoid long file uploads.But we're not stopping here. Take a look at our stretch goals below :)  If we exceed our funding goal, what shall we do with the additional funds? I mean apart from being able to buy more ramen noodles to survive? Make our free software even more awesome of course! Here's our plan. If we reach this goal, we'll work Harder to make our addon Better than ever before.  Here's how. We're working on a new design for distributing tasks which makes more efficient use of your machines. It will make sure no computer stands idle during a task.We're also going to give you feedback even earlier with tasks like rendering being broken down into smaller parts which display as they finish, giving you more opportunity to preview your render and stop and correct if you spot mistakes.CrowdRender will do it Faster, which makes you Stronger ;)Estimated Delivery December 2018You can batch if you want to! You can leave deadlines behind...We will provide a suite of sweet management tools allowing you to batch, queue and schedule tasks, such as rendering, so that you can more easily control your projects. Imagine being able to simply setup a task like a render from your laptop, start it, then immediately begin working on another project, or close the lid and go to the beach or cafe, and the task keeps going all the way to the finish. Best of all it will be part of our free software that you can download for zero money.Estimated Delivery December 2018More and more of our users are suggesting what other apps we should be supporting. But, there can only be one.... for this campaign I mean! So we've set a goal to produce a plugin for one other app for this stretch goal, but there are so many to choose from. We need help to choose, so let the battle commence in the comments section, tell us there who it should be and we'll see... Who won? Who's Next? You Decide! Estimated Delivery Feb 2019 There will be some distributed physics solving, and then there will be some cake.*If you've ever had to sit through baking some physics, you'll know this hurts. Having some way of speeding it up would be good wouldn't it? Luckily there is, there are parts of each type of simulation that can benefit from being processed on multiple computers.Reaching this level of backing means we'll create a distribution system for physics solving and produce a set of solvers that run across multiple machines, allowing you to speed up your animation baking by as many machines you have available to you. This will also work with the cloud so if you need this solving in a hurry, we've got you covered.*the cake is a lie...Estimated Delivery April 2019  CrowdRender makes tasks faster by dividing them up into parts which get processed on other computers. Processing a large task this way is called parallel processing and can really speed up renders or animations or other long running intensive computations.The process works by transferring your project file to all the computers you connect to. It then configures the application you're using to process part of the project on each computer. Here's an example, rendering a frame of animation.An image is divided into chunks called tiles, each computer renders a tile. As each tile is completed its transferred back to the computer you are working on where its immediately displayed inside the application you're using.This is incredibly effective, by dividing an image in half, each computer has half the work and so finishes in half the time (if both computers are equally powerful). Use three computers, your render time is now reduce to a third, and so on. We've also designed our system to be easy to setup. It takes less than five minutes to install and use the current alpha release, take a look!   Be among the first to try the new platform out. You'll be given access to the latest versions of our addon for Blender and the CrowdRender Cloud platform for EVERY release; now and forever!Estimated Delivery: You'll be granted early access when the campaign closes, new builds will be released every six to eight weeks as we build and test the new components.Render credit allows you to access AWS EC2 servers on our cloud system which combine with your own hardware to boost your computer power. Our cloud system is in early access testing now and will be officially released in June after all the kinks have been worked out.Estimated Delivery: June 2018Each time we plan a new release, we look to our users to tell us what they want us to work on. Now we're introducing a way for our most avid users to be heard by allowing you to vote on what features make it into each release. You'll get a privileged view of our plan for release and get to vote on which issues and features get worked on. Estimated Delivery: Starting June 2018We're SO EXCITED!! Blendtuts is supporting our campaign! They're allowing us to package their Dark Forest Tutorial content as one of the items in our perks. Dark Forest contains 11 chapters worth 12.5 hours of training and focusses on skills to help you stay on top of projects, taught to you by the presenter taking you through how to create your own dark forest scene. Includes all assets seen in the video. Estimated Delivery: July 2018Come join us as we get instructed by the masters. Oliver Villar from Blendtuts takes us through the world of hard surface modelling while The Mantissa (aka Midge Sinnavae) shows us how he does what he does (which is freakin awesome if you've ever seen it). Come, listen, ask questions and get enlightened on how to get the edge in your art.Check out the mantissa's website -> https://themantissa.netCheckout Blendtuts website -> https://www.blendtuts.com Estimated Delivery: July-August 2018We're building a new service to access computers from popular cloud compute platforms like Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Compute. You pay a flat rate each month for a share of a powerful dual xeon based server. These servers have 72 to 96 cores and over 200GB of RAM. Estimated Delivery: December 2018Wooo! Our most sincere gratitude and thanks to Aidy Burrows and Gleb Alexandrov! They've been extremely generous in supporting our campaign by allowing us to package their literally epic tutorial series, Space VFX, as one of our perk items. This premium content is out of this world, as will your art be if you use it ;). Get in quick since there are limited numbers in the lower value perks and they're sure to go at close to the speed of light! Estimated Delivery: July 2018Backing at this level deserves a special shoutout, during our live stream, we'll recognise you for your amazing backing power! If you've got a website, artstation or portfolio, we'll give you a plug live on air which will also be uploaded to our youtube channel and shared on our twitter and facebook profiles giving you some nice exposure :)Estimated Delivery: July-August 2018Our slack channel is reserved for our very special supporters. We give them our immediate attention when they need us. Having access to slack means you can chat with us via skype and get support quickly when you need it. You can share screenshots, project files, logs and more all in one place.Estimated Delivery: June 2018 When your head explodes due to reasons related to our software, or if you just need a helping hand, lean on us, when you're not strong, we'll help you carry on. Ok, dedicated support basically means that when you need us, we'll setup a video conference with you and help you one on one until you're back up and running. Estimated Delivery: June 2018​ Custom FeatureIf there is something you really want building we'll build it for you. There are conditions of course! We're not going to write you a AAA game or a whole new application! Basically if you think there is a feature that is missing from our addon that we're not building in this project, you can have it built for you :D.We've had suggestions, some of the good ones have been a different mode of distributing rendering where each computer renders a different frame of the animation rather than a part of one frame. Others are to support other addons or plugins such as other render engines. Ok, some terms and conditions. To qualify your feature needs to be something we can add to the current project, which means:
It needs to be something we can actually do without requiring permission or help from another company or person. For example, if we need another piece of software changed to give you what you want, or enter into an agreement with that person or company, then we're not obliged to build that feature, even if you backed at this level. We will, however do our best to change it to get a similar result. 
It needs to be something we can build on our current platform. We totally want to make software for other apps and systems in the future but right now, we're keeping this to blender, otherwise you'd be waiting ages
It must be an extension of our system. We can't build a new addon, or web platform or anything else. 
So please decide carefully when you pledge. If you want to check with us first, before you pledge, then please contact us at info at crowdrender dot com dot au. We'll be super happy to hear your idea and tell you straight if we're happy to build it as a perk for this campaign.   The main risk with this project is simply not having sufficient funds to complete it. This is always an issue to any project right? Since we're running a software project, not a hardware project, we face less problems. We have no real regulatory hurdles like physical products do. Electronic goods for example have to be safe, especially if they plug into the mains supply. So for our project the main risk we're managing is sufficient funding.We're up to the task of managing this. We've been working on this project now for five years and we've been able to build and ship software for our alpha releases with increasing pace in over the past twelve months. Our fourth publicly available revision of the alpha is now free to download including integration with the cloud which was built with funding from a government grant and friends and family. That project came in on budget. More importantly most of the problems we had in the developing the alpha we have today came from learning how to integrate with Blender. Our plugin for blender is now maturing and we've gained invaluable experience coding in this environment. We've now got the experience we need to develop more plugins and make the current one better. Another important fact is that most of the features being built in the new system will be in code that we totally own and have complete control over which makes it much easier and much less risky. So, maybe you'd like to try out the current release? You can access our latest alpha version using the link below. You'll need to also install Blender (Blender is 100% free software by the way) since the current alpha program only supports Blender, though if we reach the stretch goals we're setting we'll be able to support other applications as well!  Our addon/plugins are/will be 100% free software! All you need to do is register with an e-mail to get access to the downloads section of our website (or use facebook or G+ to log in if you don't want to use e-mail/password to register).https://www.crowd-render.com/ Well if you made it this far down the page, we congratulate you! Thanks for spending some time with us on our campaign page. If you have already backed, thank you so much! You have our gratitude and we're excited to be making some cool software :DThanks for giving the campaign a whacking!",25.0,6,"1 Campaign

<p>Over the years we found that sites created at the very popular Wix &amp; Squarespace just don't measure up. The limitations of the interface on both these services just do not compare to what WordPress has to offer.  The multitude of plugin developers worldwide enhance the WordPress community.

<p>The laptop is a great tool for working. But its low screen positioning and fixed keyboard force users into awkward postures, causing neck-and-shoulder pain and diminished comfort.</p>
<p>Problem is, the traditional laptop stand is too bulky to carry around and often takes a lot of time to set up - turning it into a productivity-killer.</p>

<p>Our adhesive MOFT stand has got a lot of support from backers worldwide. A huge success indeed, but we didn’t stop there. With the help of our awesome users, we’ve developed the Universal version in response to the market. The Universal version with perforated surface is compatible with more laptop models for better cooling, and can be folded and stored in 10 seconds as well.</p>

<p><strong>---Important Notice---</strong></p>
<p>This Universal version of MOFT stand does not adhere to the back of your laptop, so its setup is not as fast as the adhesive one, but it’s still as easy as pie. Please check the dimensions of each stand before you buy.</p>

<p>MOFT stands for “Mobile Office for Travelers”. A collective focused on creating innovations that boost productivity from a variety of angles.  </p>
<p>As a multinational team with people aged from 23 to 33, we are on our computers at least eight hours a day, often on our laptops in a mobile state - from airplanes to rail, from cafes to parks, anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>And that has caused several of us to suffer from serious physical problems, specifically cervical spondylosis. We have tried many laptop stands on the market, but we are not satisfied with them.  They are often a burden to carry around and a chore to set up, and sometimes,  you may always forget to bring it. </p>
<p>So, we decided to develop an easy-to-carry, lightweight laptop stand that was sturdy, ergonomically superior and aesthetically seamless.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551266989/t54jzksambrg9chcmciv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Over the following three years, we spent time, effort and expense researching and then creating several prototypes, until we produced a laptop stand we wanted ourselves. And not only that, friends of ours wanted it! We were on to something.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551267166/znllx3clzoza2pm1pafb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>From there, we made a number of crucial improvements to the angle, material and craftsmanship in an effort to reach laptop stand perfection.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551267234/b0mni77kdd6vygsptcuz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In that process of creation and refinement, we also became determined to make the eventual retail price as low as possible.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551267307/zaqzoujrnesoqx96jct0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With this entire package of quality, innovation and affordability finally coming together, we decided to bring MOFT to the people. </p>

<p>Featured on <a href=""https://backerplanet.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BackerPlanet</a> - IDEAL PLANET FOR CROWDFUNDING ENTHUSIASTS.</p>
</div></div>","The laptop is a great tool for working. But its low screen positioning and fixed keyboard force users into awkward postures, causing neck-and-shoulder pain and diminished comfort.
Problem is, the traditional laptop stand is too bulky to carry around and often takes a lot of time to set up - turning it into a productivity-killer.
 
We set out to make sure every road warrior can work absolutely anywhere with ease and comfort. That's where MOFT comes in. It’s lightweight, portable, convenient, patented and feels ""invisible""——that it is MOFT invisible stand.


We truly believe“Good design is invisible"" and put this philosophy into creating MOFT: unseen when attached, unfelt when worked on, unnoticed when carried. 
You will never be troubled by forgetting to take a laptop stand when going out, because MOFT acts as a natural, seamless appendage of your computer.
 
Nothing extra, only simplicity and reliability. Everything is ""feeling right""  and you don’t even notice it.


We're super excited to get an honest review from Unbox Therapy, Thank you!


 


Five colors is available for MOFT stand: Silver; Space Grey; Gold; Rose Gold and Diamond.


 
It's very easy for you to use MOFT stand and only takes One Second to open and close it. so you won't have a frustration of spending much time on packing and unpacking the device.

Plus, MOFT is always with the Laptop, so you have the same mobility you are used to.

Weighing a mere 3 oz. and only 1/9” thick, you just might forget you’re carrying MOFT around with you. And for the benefits MOFT stand provides as a mobile workstation, its small measurements are that much more impressive! 

 

MOFT stand is constructed with unique PU and fiber glass material, meaning it’s as strong and stable as other bulkier stands at a fraction of the size! It can hold up to 18 lbs.

It's compatible with a wide range of Laptops - Fits up to 15.6"" Laptops

Compatible Model: 11.6""-15.6"" Laptops with no air vents underside(Not including Surface Book.)
With built-in magnets, you can unfold MOFT stand quickly and it securely attaches to the flat surface.


MOFT stand is equipped with two elevation adjustments, making it easy to find the ideal height and comfort.

 

The high-lifting mode significantly optimizes on your sitting posture, applying a 3 inches elevation to your computer screen. 
 

The low-lifting mode takes a 2 inches elevation and can be perfectly adoptive to standing desks.

MOFT stand’s removable glue lets it conveniently attach and detach from your laptop without leaving a single mark or scratch, re-attaching with the same strong effectiveness.

 
-Introducing the Universal Version-
Our adhesive MOFT stand has got a lot of support from backers worldwide. A huge success indeed, but we didn’t stop there. With the help of our awesome users, we’ve developed the Universal version in response to the market. The Universal version with perforated surface is compatible with more laptop models for better cooling, and can be folded and stored in 10 seconds as well.

---Important Notice---
This Universal version of MOFT stand does not adhere to the back of your laptop, so its setup is not as fast as the adhesive one, but it’s still as easy as pie. Please check the dimensions of each stand before you buy.

 
Special Edition: When MOFT Meets Classic Art
The adhesive MOFT invisible laptop stand customized with Katsushika Hokusai - The Great Wave off Kanagawa on the whole canvas to express your unique taste of the breathtaking art. Designed to make an impact, this MOFT stand won’t go unnoticed. Simple. Elegant. 
---Important Shipping Information---
Limited quantity. Pre-order now. Shipping is expected in July. However, please note that the delivery dates are estimates and subject to change based on a number of external factors.

 

MOFT stands for “Mobile Office for Travelers”. A collective focused on creating innovations that boost productivity from a variety of angles.  
As a multinational team with people aged from 23 to 33, we are on our computers at least eight hours a day, often on our laptops in a mobile state - from airplanes to rail, from cafes to parks, anywhere and everywhere.
And that has caused several of us to suffer from serious physical problems, specifically cervical spondylosis. We have tried many laptop stands on the market, but we are not satisfied with them.  They are often a burden to carry around and a chore to set up, and sometimes,  you may always forget to bring it. 
So, we decided to develop an easy-to-carry, lightweight laptop stand that was sturdy, ergonomically superior and aesthetically seamless.

Over the following three years, we spent time, effort and expense researching and then creating several prototypes, until we produced a laptop stand we wanted ourselves. And not only that, friends of ours wanted it! We were on to something.
From there, we made a number of crucial improvements to the angle, material and craftsmanship in an effort to reach laptop stand perfection.

In that process of creation and refinement, we also became determined to make the eventual retail price as low as possible.

With this entire package of quality, innovation and affordability finally coming together, we decided to bring MOFT to the people. 

We are excited and proud to present MOFT laptop stand to you. We hope that all our research, work and creativity have produced a product that will change your mobile life for the better. Your support is greatly appreciated.

<h4>BUILDING AND DESIGN</h4>
<div><br/></div>
<p>The proposal calls for the manufacturing of simple, sturdy, quality toys made from repurposed wood and from wood scraps obtained for free from carpenters, cabinet makers and home improvement centers. The toys are non toxic and will be finished and coated with safe oils suitable for human consumption. The wheels, axles, dowels, plugs, round stock and other milled components is to be purchased from suppliers. This avoids a heavy investment in machinery and expedites turnaround time.<br/></p>
<p>We are designing toys based on a long history of quality wood toys that require minimum cutting. We have professionals volunteering their time to help with design and setup of work space.</p>
<p>Design is dynamic and reflects quick adaptation to wood and material donated.</p>
<p>We are seeking to minimize equipment and propose that the toys have minimal curves and no hardware.</p>
<p>All drilling is done using jigs for depth and hole location accuracy.</p>
<p>The assembly of these is done by using non toxic wood glue applied with a brush and pieces are held together by clamps and jigs during the assembly. When necessary, pieces are held additionally with wooden dowels.</p>
<p>It is essential that children earn money from this apart from the school. This money goes to a trust to be used for special needs as defined by the children.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>FINISHING</h4>
<div><br/></div>
<p>The toys will be finished through several sanding applications up to 220 grit and then polished with scouring pads. The toys are coated with polish made from  beeswax, olive oil and vitamin E for final finish. Instructions are provided how to clean toy and re-apply finishing. These organic products can be safely handled without gloves and are non-toxic.</p>
<p>The toys cannot have any paint as these can be toxic to children who often tend to put things in the mouths. Human-safe food colorant may be use to darken wheels or other parts or when color is needed.</p>

<h4>WHERE WE ARE</h4>

<p>We have completed our first round of design. We have two pending contracts from NGO's working within Ukraine to build their Christmas toys and other toys to give to children who have lost a parent or a relative in the conflict.</p>
<p>We have allocated eleven stores in Lviv and Kyiv that will carry our products at no cost to us.</p>
<p>We are in initial negotiations to have our toys sold at the Ukrainian Museum in New York and two major toy stores in New York.</p>

<h4><span>IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION</span></h4>
<i><br/></i><p><i>This proposal does not espouse the use of child labor to yield a profit. It is a mechanism to empower children, especially those between 12-16 with life skills that will be vital and essential to their wellness and social integration. We strive to provide a sense of belonging and teach them discipline, responsibilities, self reliance and business sense. Many of these children leave the system at 16 or 17. Many young men and women have no jobs and are lost to the streets, to drugs, crime and gangs. Many of these young people need an extension of their schooling with marketable skills to ease them into professions. It is not uncommon for people to marry before they are 20 in Ukraine. The learning curve is steep and narrow. We are proposing to create a fully functioning and profitable enterprise to benefit children and young adults. The children who must leave the system can stay as salaried employees until they find placement in other jobs and they can use the skill set and reference their experience and knowledge learned to compete in the job market. We plan to partner with local businesses to create employment opportunities for our graduates and create a mentoring program to help them continue their education at local universities.</i></p>

I plan to make Trace multi-platform, meaning that you can share your location with people who have an iPhone, Android phone, Windows Phone or access to a web browser.What Makes Trace DifferentThe problem with many location-tracking apps is that you and your friends need to have similar devices to use them; Find Friends works only on iPhones and iPads, for example. I plan to make Trace available for most popular devices: iPhone/iPad, Android, Windows Phone as well as a fully-functional website so you can share with people who don’t have these devices. There are many uses for tracking apps. They can be used to make life easier if you are meeting someone or hosting a surprise party; they can be used for security reasons if you have children or other relatives that you worry about; they can be used for personal reasons if don’t want to share with anyone and just want to keep a record. I personally use Trace for my family’s benefit: my mother and grandmother like to check up on me while I at university to make sure I am safe.I have already started…I have already begun work on the Windows Phone app and accompanying website. After working on this project in my spare time I have been able to get the base app functioning and have been slowly adding features over the past few months. As of the start of this campaign the app can be used to: 

Securely log in or create an account.


View your location on a map.


Background updates to the Trace service.


View your most recent location update from a live tile on your start screen.


Share your current location with anyone via a webpage.

A start has been made on the website; it supports:

Securely logging in or creating an account.


Showing your most recent location update from the phone app.

Security, for a location tracking app, is essential to ensure that your location information is only available to your chosen friends and family. I have put a lot of time into securing user account creation and authentication, and made sure all network traffic is over HTTPS.What I want to achieveThe first thing that I want to achieve is to complete both the Windows Phone app over the next 10-11 weeks. To do this I will need to add the following features: 

Friends system (adding/removing friends)

Privacy (location sharing options, share location for an hour etc.)
Wifi only mode

Statistics (number of locations gathered, total distance traveled, number of areas visited)

Security (enhanced password security

While it may sound cliché, I would like to think of it as the marriage of Uber, Pokémon, Yelp &amp; Fantasy Football; by first targeting the Recruiting &amp; HR Industry, but ultimately leveraging this platform for handling referrals and ratings thru gamification and crowdsourcing across any service industry; whether you need a database administrator, a real estate agent, a doctor or a contractor of any type, we know our platform will help improve your quality of life by building a community that will help you find the right person for the right job, yet weed-out those who your friends would not hire. Please read-on and allow me to explain what I mean by sharing my experiences backed by empirical data.</p><p>Let me start by asking, how many “connections, “friends” or “followers” do you have in your social networks? hundreds? thousands? – out of those, how many do you interact with on a daily, weekly, monthly basis? If you are like me, not that many; there is perhaps a handful you do keep in touch with and only a few of those with whom you don’t, yet are able to pick-right-up where you left off when you do.</p><p>The challenge with this on and off and then on again, is that relationship gaps grow, and your 2 degrees of separation may become, 3 or 6; nonetheless you remain “virtually” connected and should not be afraid to reach-out, even if it has been a while. I have been lucky enough to have connections which have lasted 10, 15, 20+ years, with whom I don’t interact often, yet I know I can count on them when needed, especially when looking for a new job (you can read more about this serendipitous journey in my book “<a href=""https://leanpub.com/The100DollarJourney"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The $100 Journey</a>” ).</p><p>It occurred to me that the reason why these lasting relationships are so important stem from the fact that they physically know you, they know what you do well (and not so well), who you are personally, socially and how you work; this is more than any recruiter could hope to accomplish during a 30 minute in-person meeting at the nearest Starbucks while constantly glancing at their phone; yet we fail to have the courage to ask those who really know us for help and prefer to entrust our future, and that of our loved ones to complete strangers. I personally believe that is this fear which prevent us from knocking on someone’s virtual door and ask for help when stranded.</p><p>This I know, we have done to ourselves; we failed to prepare for a job-drought, and do not have any money stored in our Karma bank, hence at the last minute we have no option but to reach out to whoever will listen, especially those who have made a living building relationships on our behalf, and are willing to stick their neck out for us – of course, for a hefty price. <a href=""http://www.hiremenot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HireMeNot</a> is the platform which will allow you to take back control of your network, and help you make these kind of Karma deposits painless, even fun! by enabling you to share and refer your contacts across your network without a broker.</p><p>In an effort to validate these ideas, I decided conduct a social experiment and identify the roadblocks preventing job-seekers from landing their next dream-job and with over 1,000 connections in the various social networks that exist today, I set-up to better understand how to truly leverage the well-known “6 degrees of separation” and how advantageous would it be to actually network with my connections as intended and not just collect them as we often do with business cards. For 3 months I spent 2-3 hours a day searching for jobs, and applying blindly using every single job-board out there; from those applications, I chose and picked a few jobs I felt I was a perfect fit for and further researched the companies and their employees. During these 3 months, I reviewed 1057 e-mails with an average of 10 jobs within each e-mail. This means, I read over 10,000 job-descriptions ranging from Manager to Vice-President of Software Development. Out of those, I applied to 308 jobs which resulted in 17 follow-up conversations with recruiters (5.5%) and from those only 2 resulted in follow-up interviews with a hiring manager (0.6%) – these are not very good odds.</p><p>Concurrently to the unsolicited job alerts/reviews and applications previously described, I targeted 33 positions via on-line networking/job-board by connecting, and messaging the recruiter and/or hiring manager but only after first connecting with the highest executive at that company I could connect with without a premium account; this approach helped reduced the “degrees of separation” and increase the success rate. Out of those 33, all (100%) accepted to connect, 21 (63.6%) followed-up, 12 (36.4%) resulted in a screening interview and 5 (15.2%) resulted in an interview with a hiring manager, 2 of which became formal job offers – these are much better odds if you ask me!</p><p>Now remember, these are people who do not know me personally, but are part of my network; contacts I collected when looking for a job. In fact, 15 out of the 33 jobs were brokered through a recruiter from an agency; regretfully, only 1 out of the 5 interviews with a hiring manager came from a professional recruiter; the other 14 recruiters, I never heard from again nor was there any follow-up (even after I pushed the issue and pressed forward requesting feedback – nothing, not a one came back with a yea/nay or provided any closure to the process; without naming names, you know who you are). In my experience, I had better luck reaching out, asking for referrals and following-up with the hiring and/or HR manager directly than working with a recruiter; in fact, 5 of my last 6 jobs were direct hires or referrals from someone that knew me. I can only imagine what kind of success-ratio anyone would be able to achieve if there was a mechanism in social-networking/job-board sites to do what HireMeNot will enable us to do starting today, which in addition to providing crowdsourcing-type referrals, will allow you to rate and hold accountable those who give this profession a bad name. <a href=""http://www.hiremenot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HireMeNot</a> will initially be focused on facilitating and leveraging your social networks as they were intended; especially for those who feel disenfranchised by a minority of unscrupulous brokers, staffing agencies and professional headhunters due to age, gender, religion or ethnic background. This I know for a fact happens more often than not in this somewhat unregulated industry; I will spare you the details regarding questions someone like me - an immigrant with an accent - has to field from these kind of recruiters in addition to their lack of follow-up or follow-through. I feel so strongly about this that the only recruiters that will remain in my network after today will be those that have taken the time to know me and earned my respect, those that fall out, will indeed become the HireMeNots in my network.</p><p>Do note, that the majority of my existing network (prior to this exercise) was comprised of people I’ve known over the years at my previous jobs and/or places I have lived who very likely continue in those jobs. There is no mechanism today for them to openly refer me to any job they may encounter (outside from their current employer) where they would think I could be a good fit. Even if they do tag me or mention me on a post, there is no incentive for them to do so, or for me to make them aware that I am looking for a new job (in stealth-mode). Additionally, there is no easy way to search which of them have switched jobs and are working for companies in my area (who may be hiring). In a nutshell, there are no open-search mechanisms for me to tap my network of over 1,000 professionals and have them become my personal champion, a freelance recruiter of sorts; this indeed is what we are going to accomplish with HireMeNot. We are going to empower anyone to become a freelance recruiter and share, trade or sell contacts in exchange for in-app currency, reputation points and badges (Karma points which can be used for the same purposes) and real money from sponsored jobs; the platform will empower your network (who knows you best) to refer you to any job and compete with others on a number of successful referrals that may land you a job via “Fantasy Recruitment &amp; Referral Leagues” chockfull of curated opportunities.</p><p>With embedded playbooks, drafts, ratings, rankings, playoffs &amp; leaderboards, we hope to provide a fun and effective mechanism of checks &amp; balances for the recruiting &amp; HR industry and help those who are struggling to find a job, internship or contract; in fact, we are striving to help you find not just any job, but the right job via referrals, ratings and healthy competition.

AI has found its way into many sectors and industries including marketing, banking, finance, agriculture, and many more. Our Platform's Beginnings  As early as 2017 and driven by our belief in the potential of ""humanized AI"" to ethically augment the abilities of humans and all living creatures, driving sustainability and environmental conservation efforts, our team have decided to work on harnessing the power of AI to democratize software application building allowing anyone with no prior computer science training to build applications.Our engineers have concepted and raised a one-of-a-kind AI being, we call her Julia, the ultimate coding-bot that will forever change the way web and mobile applications are built.Trained on millions of lines of code from publicly available applications and combining the collective wisdom of thousands of developers, Julia will assist and guide no-code entrepreneurs, makers, and dreamers as they develop the applications that will touch millions of lives and make for a happy future. 
Enter iRithm We’re building iRithm, the world’s first fully AI-driven app builder empowering anyone to build web and mobile software products whenever the inspiration strikes and without writing a single line of code. It is the first Text2APP platform that we know of. Describe your application to the chatbot and we build it for you. iRithm builds serious apps. By serious we mean rather complex and functionality-rich apps and platforms - think platforms like Airbnb, Amazon, and Fiverr for both mobile and web. Unlike, other popular players in the field like Wix or Webflow - we don't just build websites or eCommerce Apps, iRithm allows its users to build any App they can imagine. A serious App doesn't have to look serious - it actually gets you closer to your dream and saves you a ton of money - it will make you smile! There is an idea in your mind somewhere – a vision of the app that you would build, if only you could write the code for it. This is a problem that, over and over, dreamers and entrepreneurs worldwide are encountering. Like you, they know what they would like to build but feel like they can't do so. Looking out over all of the technical work that goes into building an app, too many people have concluded that just can't get the job done.Our solution is simple: forget about the code. Using iRithm, you never need to think about writing code again. Instead, you can keep your focus on your idea, your vision, and your business.Who is iRithm for? How iRithm Works Working via next-generation AI and machine learning algorithms, iRithm generates the code you need automatically. To accomplish that, we are using a technology of popular, open-source systems for maximum maintainability and continuity. We then deploy your app on Google's industry-standard cloud computing infrastructure to ensure hosting, security, and scalability – again, without ever requiring you to type in a single line of code.Our tech team just released this sneak-peek of Julia in action. Watch how, Julia, helps iRithm users throughout their entire app development journey by offering smart recommendations based on the context of the application being built.

<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>From fake luxury goods to mock medicines and baby meal, the business of counterfeit goods is one of the largest underground industries that is rapidly growing. Current estimates of the overall annual economic value of this industry exceed $1500 billion and demonstrate a positive trend of about 10%. Consequently, the losses in tax revenue account for $78 billion and the number of non-created working places overpasses 2.5 million annually. A quick analysis of the fake industry composition allows easily identify the risks it brings to the individuals. First of all, it concerns counterfeit medicine, food, cosmetics, toys, car and aircraft spare parts, as a non-exhaustive list of possible examples leading to life and health danger. On the other side, the brands are suffering due to non-generated profit, reputation damages and loss of customers.</p>
<h3>What is “Trust your product”?</h3>
<p><strong>“Trust your product”</strong> is a mobile platform that is designed to help us, ordinary customers, and brands distinguish original products from counterfeits, thereby protecting the lives and health of us and our loved ones, as well as preventing damage that counterfeits can inflict on brand’s reputation and their relationships with customers. Its goal is to accomplish this task with no extra charge, without any specialized, costly equipment, yet, by anyone, anytime, and anywhere.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>The main idea of <strong>“Trust your product”</strong> is to exploit invariant unclonable random features inherent to materials and processes used for products’ manufacturing that serve a similar purpose as human biometrics serves in person identification and authentication. The results of recent scientific research that were partially obtained by this project originator, demonstrate that such features acquired using cameras of habitual smartphones at a certain zone of the product surface, or its packaging or label, are discriminating enough to uniquely represent every of them, whether it concerns watches, carton packaging, or rubber labels.</p>

<h3>Where is your money going?</h3>
<p>Mostly, your contribution will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Research and development </strong>– we still need to invest in this domain in order to be able to optimally protect a wide range of products.</li>
<li>
<strong>Testing </strong>– in order to finalize the development of the ready-to-market platform prototype, we need to purchase a server and several models of smartphones. At this stage, we assume to follow the LEAN strategy in order to minimize our budget.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing </strong>– we are planning to launch several marketing campaigns to be initiated via various communication channels such as press, exhibitions, workshops, etc., that will allow us to reinforce the global awareness of the <strong>“Trust your product”</strong> as an available efficient option in combat against counterfeiting and to further grow its community.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fees </strong>– payment of various fees (including the ones due to Indiegogo).</li>
</ul>
<p>We chose $75’000 in order to at least compensate for the cost we have already invested and still need to invest in order to produce our LEAN product prototype. If more money will be collected, we plan to extend our initial goals via adding some additional options to the original design, for instance, a possibility to analyze the data generated by the platform to address a brand marketing needs.</p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksiy-koval-a4319116/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Oleksiy Koval</strong></a> possesses substantial experience (more than 15 years) in the field of product protection against counterfeiting and multimedia security. Along with his professional career, he was engaged in world class research in the referred domains in the Swiss academic environment as well as actively participated in collaboration with Swiss and European industrial partners as researcher and consultant. His overall implemented project portfolio includes more than 15 titles. He has two Ph.D. degrees, in mathematical modeling and computer science, respectively, authors and co-authors 1 book, more than 120 peer-reviewed publications, and 3 patents.</p>
<p><strong>Olga Kalynovska</strong> is creative designer and artist who will help make your participation in this campaign unforgettable.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main strength of the project is that the <strong>“Trust your product”</strong> functions! This result was possible by dint of our investment of time, effort and due to our passion that we put into the project. We strongly believe in the project and in the value that its outcomes will have to every person and every brand. Our determination to succeed with its complete implementation is additionally confirmed by the monetary investment made in order to reach the project’s current status.</p>
<p>Our former experience, qualifications, and prior obtained results should serve an additional guarantee of the minimization of risks such an adventure could meet along its way towards success. However, we should be aware of the innovative character of the project that involves the use of hardware components that might reveal unforeseen obstacles. Additionally, we should not fully eliminate the chance of making mistakes that are typical of humans and that might introduce some extra delays into the project timeline.</p>
<p>Would the project go along its original planning or suffers from unexpected time modifications, we promise to always keep you timely updated.</p>

Marketing – we are planning to launch several marketing campaigns to be initiated via various communication channels such as press, exhibitions, workshops, etc., that will allow us to reinforce the global awareness of the “Trust your product” as an available efficient option in combat against counterfeiting and to further grow its community.

Fees – payment of various fees (including the ones due to Indiegogo).

We chose $75’000 in order to at least compensate for the cost we have already invested and still need to invest in order to produce our LEAN product prototype. If more money will be collected, we plan to extend our initial goals via adding some additional options to the original design, for instance, a possibility to analyze the data generated by the platform to address a brand marketing needs.
Who are we?
Oleksiy Koval possesses substantial experience (more than 15 years) in the field of product protection against counterfeiting and multimedia security. Along with his professional career, he was engaged in world class research in the referred domains in the Swiss academic environment as well as actively participated in collaboration with Swiss and European industrial partners as researcher and consultant. His overall implemented project portfolio includes more than 15 titles. He has two Ph.D. degrees, in mathematical modeling and computer science, respectively, authors and co-authors 1 book, more than 120 peer-reviewed publications, and 3 patents.
Olga Kalynovska is creative designer and artist who will help make your participation in this campaign unforgettable.
Risks & Challenges
The main strength of the project is that the “Trust your product” functions! This result was possible by dint of our investment of time, effort and due to our passion that we put into the project. We strongly believe in the project and in the value that its outcomes will have to every person and every brand. Our determination to succeed with its complete implementation is additionally confirmed by the monetary investment made in order to reach the project’s current status.
Our former experience, qualifications, and prior obtained results should serve an additional guarantee of the minimization of risks such an adventure could meet along its way towards success. However, we should be aware of the innovative character of the project that involves the use of hardware components that might reveal unforeseen obstacles. Additionally, we should not fully eliminate the chance of making mistakes that are typical of humans and that might introduce some extra delays into the project timeline.
Would the project go along its original planning or suffers from unexpected time modifications, we promise to always keep you timely updated.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

At GIV, we like to be a little rebellious and evoke change through innovative thinking.  But, as a profit-for-good social enterprise, we are also very driven by good causes, so we like to call ourselves ‘Rebels with a Cause’.The GIV dashboard enables you to fund good causes without disrupting your life or your bank balance. Our revolutionary new model for GIVing makes it easy, simple, and free for you to support what matters most to you. Join our community of ‘Rebels with a Cause’ and help us make a positive and happy impact in our world.  #rebelwithacauseAt GIV, we believe in total transparency and complete honesty. The internet can often be shrouded in mystery and full of technical terms that no one understands. We want to make everything  100% clear, easy, and uncomplicated. So here is a simple overview:To make it free, easy, and uncomplicated for individuals to support the good causes they care about by incorporating GIVing into our everyday lives online through creative, purposeful, and positive use of technology and commerce-for-good.A fairer and more balanced world where individuals can have their say on the development of their surrounding environment by using their purchasing power to catalyse positive social change within local communities and global societies.Above all else, we value creativity, community, positivity, kindness, acceptance, empowerment, development, and happiness.This is a demo of your personalised dashboard.On the right, is your creative dashboard. The dashboard contains feeds of photography, art, and information - specially designed to reflect the feel-good vibe of the GIV community. In your dashboard, you will have access to your own social media feed, a news feed, a space for art and creativity, inspirational and positive messages from around the world, as well as a summary of the good you and your fellow GIVers have spread by using your shopping dashboard.On the left, you will be able to navigate through your own individualised toolbar. The toolbar is a space for you to organise all your favourite online shops and websites into personalised categories, making it easy and simple for you to access your favourite retailers - and other parts of the internet - and avoid online noise.We plan to add additional features to the dashboard in the near future, but we need your help to make our platform reach its full potential.More on this below.It all began with a small dot. A little niggle in the back of our minds. A small dot as pen touched paper and little snippets of ideas were written down. Little pictures eventually grew into one common idea. An idea that we believe can have a big impact on the world.Time and time again, each of us have been met with the cliched old adage: ‘Business is tough’. At GIV, we don’t believe in tough business, we believe in kind business.Through technology, we want to enable you to harness your purchasing power and create a fairer and more balanced society for us all. We want to make it easy, uncomplicated, and free for you to support the good causes that are important to you and your community.Follow our campaign on Instagram and Facebook. Search #itstartedwithadot. Whilst we really love our dashboard, we know we can make it even more awesome. We have loads of great ideas already, but we will also allow you and our users to have your say on how the functionality will develop in the near future.To increase the good we can spread, we need more hands on deck. We would like to employ a team of passionate and talented people to help us develop our good-cause area, help us build relationships with retailers, and help us spread the word and engage with our users.Part of your funding will be invested in developing a system for purchasing transparency.

<h3>The story</h3>
<p>If you've Googled any question about ProPresenter, it's likely that one of my tutorial videos has come up in the search.  I started making tutorials for churches in February of 2011, but it wasn't until June of the next year that people started noticing.  That's when I went from teaching about video production, in general, to how to use ProPresenter in specific.</p>
<p>Since then, I've done over 200 tutorials (216 at last count) on  ProPresenter and am always looking for ways to help you get more out of this incredible program.  That's why I've decided to create this keyboard skin.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why crowd funding?</h3>
<p>I need your help for this to work.  I'm sure that you know people who would be interested in a keyboard skin that I don't know.  So, first and foremost, share this campaign with them.</p>
<p>Secondly, for this to work, I need to get together an order that is larger than anything I've ever put together before.  That doesn't mean it's impossible, but just that I need your help to make it a reality.</p>
<ul>
<li>The design is done and the shortcuts have been tested in ProPresenter 6.</li>
<li>I've been talking with a contact at the factory and have a quote to make them.</li>
<li>Because of the economics of scale, I can't just order one for me.  I need to order 1000-2000.  That's where you come in.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>If you join me in this, you'll be making it possible for me to get a keyboard skin to not only you, but other churches who haven't yet heard about this product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once they're printed and delivered, I'll mail yours out to your church or organization.</li>
<li>You'll be able to save time each week and start to memorize the keyboard short cuts you use most often.  </li>
<li>You might be able to cut off enough prep time that those last moments of a push to get your presentations done in time, become a thing of the past.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This isn't without risk, though.  I'm not making each of these skins by hand, in my office.  This requires the help of a factory.  This is something new, though.  I've never made a keyboard skin before.  I've never contracted with a factory to take an idea and make it a reality.  Sure, I've self-published books I've had printed.  I've designed t-shirts which could be printed in small batches.  This requires a larger order, though.</p>
<p>There's a couple of reasons why these are just challenges to be overcome, not roadblocks.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a community of subscribers on YouTube that I can tap into to help this become a success.</li>
<li>I have a group on Facebook devoted to ProPresenter who said, one after another, ""Yes, that's a great idea,"" or ""I'd buy a couple"" or ""Shut up and take my money.""</li>
<li>You're here and I believe you will push this over the top.</li>
<li>I have seen enough support for this that I'll refuse to quit until it's a success.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>""How can I help if I use a different keyboard or am on Windows?""</h3>
<p>If this isn't exactly right for you, here are some ways you can help anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pray.  I believe it changes things and can help difficult things become a reality.</li>
<li>Share this campaign with others.  Just because it's not right for you, that doesn't mean it's not right for them.</li>
<li>Check back often.  If we reach the goal for the first skin, we can make others.  </li>
<li>Give me feedback.  If you catch a typo or see a mistake, let me know.</li>
<li>Keep in mind that if this campaign gets fully funded, I'll make other skins and maybe even a dedicated keyboard (probably starting with Windows, since there's no single PC manufacturer).</li>
</ul>
</div><h3>Stretch goals</h3><p>Whichever is more popular first:</p><ul>
<li>Apple Magic Keyboard with numeric keyboard skin</li>
<li>Windows keyboard or keyboard skin</li>
</ul><p>Thanks for your time; together we can do this and help churches who use ProPresenter to use it better and, more importantly, reach more people.</p></div>","The story

I have seen enough support for this that I'll refuse to quit until it's a success.


""How can I help if I use a different keyboard or am on Windows?""
If this isn't exactly right for you, here are some ways you can help anyway:

Pray.  I believe it changes things and can help difficult things become a reality.
Share this campaign with others.  Just because it's not right for you, that doesn't mean it's not right for them.
Check back often.  If we reach the goal for the first skin, we can make others.  
Give me feedback.  If you catch a typo or see a mistake, let me know.
Keep in mind that if this campaign gets fully funded, I'll make other skins and maybe even a dedicated keyboard (probably starting with Windows, since there's no single PC manufacturer).

Stretch goalsWhichever is more popular first:
Apple Magic Keyboard with numeric keyboard skin
Windows keyboard or keyboard skin
Thanks for your time; together we can do this and help churches who use ProPresenter to use it better and, more importantly, reach more people.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<b>Uber </b>lets you make money from your car; <b>Airbnb </b>lets you make money from your home; now <b>PowerMyData</b> lets you make money from your data. A key challenge today is that businesses and consumers don’t understand each other. You want the best products and services, for the best price, while maintaining your privacy. Businesses want to understand you better so that they can provide products and services you’ll buy, and keep you happy. The
current system of advertising allows middle-men (ad tech companies) to take and
sell your information without your control. However, technology is now at a
place where consumers and businesses can work together directly, while protecting
your privacy. PowerMyData is the answer.</div><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464204188/New_Uber_bq0c37.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div><br/></div><div>

<h3><strong>Innovation, imagination, hard work and perseverance lives here.</strong></h3>
<p>Kamal Dhanoa: BSc. Computer Science, Marketing Professional , Entrepreneur</p>
<p>I’ve always been a process efficiency enthusiast, an “idea’s person” – always finding opportunities to create better processes at work.</p>
<p>During my position as a Marketing Officer, I discovered core tasks that were incredibly tedious and time consuming. As I began to formulate a possible solution, I quickly realized it would benefit beyond my workplace to Marketing Professionals and Businesses across the globe. </p>
<p><strong><i>After spending months working on the concept and receiving positive feedback, I realized that full time commitment would be required. I began my startup journey.</i></strong></p>
<p>One year later, I've conducted research and development, created a prototype and have run successful series of feedback trials. Interest has been intense which has led me to this campaign. I need your support to help fund the development of Adsaki. Be part of the solution that will change marketing forever.</p>

Innovation, imagination, hard work and perseverance lives here.
Kamal Dhanoa: BSc. Computer Science, Marketing Professional , Entrepreneur
I’ve always been a process efficiency enthusiast, an “idea’s person” – always finding opportunities to create better processes at work.
During my position as a Marketing Officer, I discovered core tasks that were incredibly tedious and time consuming. As I began to formulate a possible solution, I quickly realized it would benefit beyond my workplace to Marketing Professionals and Businesses across the globe. 
After spending months working on the concept and receiving positive feedback, I realized that full time commitment would be required. I began my startup journey.
One year later, I've conducted research and development, created a prototype and have run successful series of feedback trials. Interest has been intense which has led me to this campaign. I need your support to help fund the development of Adsaki. Be part of the solution that will change marketing forever.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Despite the latest version of Aeroo Reports being for Odoo v8, it remained the favourite choice for a big number of Odoo and Python (yes, Aeroo Reports library can be used for other of your Python projects as well) developers around the world.

<li>The documentation shall be updated as well.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What if it happens that community is generous enough to raise more funds?</h3>
<p>Well yes, sometimes it happens that way...We'll do our best to spend the funds on making documentation better and more exhaustive, on supporting community members and what's most important, sustaining just another FOSS project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The short answer is: project needs funding, so that Aeroo Reports does not become obsolete.</p>
<p>While there are lot of customer projects providing constant revenue for our developers, that allowed us to pay our bills, we have been doing all the development and maintenance, funded only by our company - Alistek.</p>
<p>Now that's not the case, we need your help. We estimated time investment in porting at USD 1900,- and some extra 600,- for moving the documentation. You get Aeroo Reports functionality for Odoo v11, and more accessible and better documentation.</p>

<p>One of our aims is, reducing the risks for our backers before launching the project. For this project, all of the products are produced by hands and entirely in our workshop. We are a young group that loves our field and work in the workshop, we study about needs and solve problems and design special products then we do many activities like cutting, sewing and assembling process of products. finally, at the end of these steps, we test and examine our products then we control details and make our bags more useful. We try to make all parts of bags beneficial without any vain space. <br/>We had a serious rule during preparing these products which were making products from the best natural leathers, so we flew to Italy and spent two months sourcing the best leather in the world from tanneries in Tuscany. We made fine leather goods with the best fittings and the best natural colors. As we told, we produce all of the orders by hands so one of our challenges is to be on time in preparing them, so we made a contract with a professional leather goods factory in the Genoa to prepare them very fast and with the Italian quality. <br/>We will make a great scale of our production to meet our progress schedule and we will be sure to communicate any schedule changes honestly and openly. <br/>Thank you for support of our products, be sure that our products have high quality and you chose the best leather bags.</p>
<p>Quality Risks: <br/>We choose the material from the best quality of leathers and the best zipper in the world. all of the leathers which we choose are natural. When we finish preparing a bag, we test it and consider all of the criteria of the best bag.</p>
<p>Supply Chain Risk: <br/>Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products. But we do our best to solve all of the problems very soon. We are strong and we believe it. BUT... BUT, WE ARE PROMISING TO SEND ALL REWARDS BEFORE THE END OF APRIL!

The mission is to change the future of business meetings, investor-business searches, or professional conferences by forever dissolving the need for people to remember contact information, social networking profiles, and company profiles while building their relationship with other professionals.

""What was his name again?""
I'm tired of shaking hands with my next mentor or professional resource, and having to stop the conversation cold to make the awkward transaction of contact information. The most critical moment of building relationships with clients, future suppliers, and potential employers starts with the introduction and ends with a solid understanding of both parties as they walk away.

As a business student in college, I spend a lot of time meeting new people, building my network up, and making myself and my reputation known to the business community at my university. However, I find it very troubling that the connection strength with my network is so weak. Some of my most important network connections only vaguely come to me in the visions of their LinkedIn profiles, because I spent less time learning about them and our interaction, and more time trying to memorize who they were and how I could keep them in my social circle. How many possible business ventures, employment opportunities and friendships have been compromised because society's socialization revolves around remembering Instagram usernames and company names instead of real information?Too many... But there is hope:  How Does it Work?

<p>I think the best way to start this message is with my story. Please if you have 5 minutes, take a moment to read this.<br/>My Name is Nathan Giddings, I’m 18 and live in Blackpool, England. In 2010, my mother was involved in a car crash which has left her permanently disabled, my baby brother had just recently been born, leaving me with the full responsibility to look after her and my baby brother, obviously, at 14 raising a baby is pretty difficult. I’m so tired of seeing her break down and cry with depression because she can’t do anything and is in constant pain. Now, the worst part is, a year after that, I was diagnosed with a Liver disease that effects my immune system, causing my own body to attack itself and my nerves, this in turn, has resulted in me having Multiple Sclerosis , this leaves me in constant pain and a state of despair and deep depression. And self hatred at how my own body failed me. As you can imagine, this makes it so difficult having to look after everyone else, with no one to care for me, and no treatment for my illness, I just have to get on with it. After being a huge Apple enthusiast since the very early days, because you know, I'm a geek, I thought “wow, I wish there was a way I could get my own app's on the store.”, then I started reading into you more, to find you can make some serious money, as well as have a huge reach by putting apps on the store and doing the exact thing I want to do! As it stands, with my illness I missed the last year of school <img alt=""Frowning face"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://a.gfx.ms/emoji_02639.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Frowning face""/> And this has obviously affected my life, I’m too ill too go to college, and if I could go on my good days, I can’t afford a car, as you can imagine, with both me and my mum being out of work, and relying on my step dads meager wage who works away, we struggle. I only get £60 a week from the government, and I almost always end up giving it to my mum to buy food, this Christmas just gone will be the 4th year that me and my mother have gone without, to ensure that the kids have a good Christmas. One suggestion to help mine and my mum symptoms is a hot tub! How we are expected to afford done I have no idea. We really need a break, I haven’t been on holiday since I was 9. I have no social interaction as you can imagine. SO here is my problem, I want to code, to one day maybe earn enough money to buy my mum a house, and all the dreams cars of mine, I’m dying buy a PS4, as I sold my PS3 I got for Christmas 2011 so my mum could buy nappies, but as you can imagine, those are far out my reach. So, I come to the community to help me get that massive boost I need to start my life. I'm limited when learning Objective C as I use windows, as I'ts all I can afford, even my iPhone 5 I got in 2012 seems like it's about to explode. Even if I made an app that can earn £50 a week, that would be a life changer for me! I’d love for the  help to get me going and give me the start I need, and help me get from rags to riches! <br/><br/>Now you may think, this is just some kid who wan't to make money with a rubbish app, but I have bigs plans for an App, as I have had the idea in my mind for years, and have every detail planned out, I don't wan't to reveal any details as of you, in-case it get's stolen, but Medi-Mind is designed to help people like myself, who are ill, and also to help carers. I thought the best way for me to go about this is to make an App I need, and would personally use on a daily basis. <br/><br/>I know I ask for a lot, but not as much as other campaigns, all I need is a Mac(No hackintosh comments please) and an iPhone/iPad to test my App on. Those two things could be the foundation to my life, and can allow me to build the skills I need to finally get my idea out of my head, and into the world! As for perks, I can't really offer much in return, except my unconditional gratitude, of course anybody who helps will be credited, and who know, if I gain an income, I might even be able to give donations back!  <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
</div><div>Obviously it will be a challenge, and will require sleepless nights to get the App out there, but I have so much time and dedication to put into the app, I feel my abilities and potential are going to waste, as an honest person I will say, it could fail, but so could any business venture. But if I suceed, not only will it change my life, but it could also affect other people for the better, by using my app and improving their health.<br/><br/>Maybe you don't want to donate cash,maybe you have an old Mac lying around? Anything that can help me will be so appreciated.</div><div>My condition obviously makes it hard to function sometimes, and often, I can't even play video games like a normal teenage due to the pain I am in, as you can imagine, my social life has been severely affect by thus, and I know have very little friends, because I could never go out, I ended up leaving college and sixth form, and that has had me so worried about my future and financial security, but then I realized I had the ability to make my own money, by putting out my app that can change not only my life, but others in need too, because the amount of medication I am on now, is nothing compared to what I will need in the future, as unfortunately as I get older my nerves degrade more and my condition worsens, it's even possible I will be completely paralyzed by the time I'm 40, and possibly die. So on top of your normal life costs, I'll have medical bills too.. So please consider helping me shape my future into one I can look forward too! </div><div>

The Impact


Every aspect of our life is based on carbon based fuels, through the
utilization of alternate renewable means to generate power such as carbon
dioxide, we can  become independent and
richer.  
Carbon Dioxide has become a tool used by people who have profited from
the eradication of this compound.

vegetation on this planet.  
Fossil fuels emit not only CO2 but other noxious chemicals, they are a
necessity at this time to transport and grow your food, manufacture everything
you see and use every day.  Prices grow
higher your paycheck buys less and less. 

The utilization of CO2 can and will change that, no longer will the
government look for ways to tax your carbon footprint, no longer will wars be
fought over oil, face it we are held hostage by the people who own all the
rights to fossil fuels, oil, coal, and natural gas. In time our planet is going
to become one big garbage dump. We will no longer need face the danger of using nuclear to generate

infrastructure alone costs billions to put into place so the owner can recharge
their vehicle.  Ion batteries to produce
power are dangerous, they self- ignite and where and what is the method of
disposal.
We believe that the most sensible solution is the utilization of CO2,
it is a forever compound that can be made to work for us not against us, and it
is a God given gift to this earth.

Our challenge is to
raise the money to finish, to gain acceptance, not from the government or the

</div></div>","Do you know where you can get a business card printed?Have you ever needed something to print but finding and booking a print shop was just too difficult? That's exactly the experience I had when I moved to Metro Manila. When I asked other people, nobody knew where the good shops were at. And those aren't the only problems people have.If you found a print shop you might ask yourself: 

""How do I know their quality is good?""


""How can I reach out to them?""


""Do I have to walk to the shop to get something printed?""


""By when can they have it printed?""


""Shoot! It's Friday and I need something printed by tomorrow - can they still rush print this for my event tomorrow?!""

Those and many more questions and problems trouble most people that need something printed. Pigments is the solution that comes to the rescue!Finding print shops made easyIt doesn't have to be this hard. That's why we came up with Pigments, a site where you can conveniently find print shops around you based on what you need to print. Even better, you can then book the shop right on our site. All the details of the shop are easily understandably laid out for you, so you don't get overwhelmed. You request an estimate from the print shop and once you're happy, you book the shop through our site. As you wait for your prints to arrive or be ready to be picked up, you will always be kept up to date on Pigments about the current progress of your job.Are you a business that just needs to reprint their old letterhead again? Or even a whole set of collaterals? No problem, you'll be able to have your stuff printed again with the click of a button for your convenience, because searching for your print PDFs and sending them to the shop again is just annoying!Our humble beginningsWe are currently two members on the team and we launched a basic directory site of shops for Bangkok today. We are following up on shops in Singapore and some in the Philippines next. As we grow our database of print shops and improve our site, printing is going to become easier for you step by step. Pigments is still basic as of now, we are not yet a fancy print shop marketplace. We cannot yet make sales automatically, in fact we're just looking for our first paying customers with our MVP (Minimum Viable Product, the bare minimum product you could build to test your business idea) and intend to do everything manually, truly MVP style!Are you looking to print something? We can find a print shop for you based on your needs, coordinate with the print shop for you and ensure your print PDFs get submitted to the shop error-free.Raising Friends, Family & Fools Funds to go from MVP to a fully fledged, awesome productAre you a friend of ours? Are you a family member? Or perhaps you are simply a crazy fool who believes in the product and the vision we believe in ourselfs? That printing needs to be improved in Asia? Kindly consider donating to this fundraiser and grab one of our awesome perks! The funds raised are going to be used to keep Pigments running until we're the place to get your stuff printed at. Our goal is to use those funds to bridge the gap between what we have now and the marketplace model that we are going to have soon. Our milestones from 1 to 3But for what exactly are you giving your money away? 

Our first milestone is a diverse list of print shops all over Asia.
Followed by milestone number two, the launch of our shop sites that let you enquire for a detailed print estimate. 
After that, milestone number three is making it possible to upload your print PDFs through our site, so you can book and pay without hassle.

<p>Have you ever left your home and forgot to turn off the coffee maker? Have you ever been too tired to get up from bed and turn off the light? Have you ever wished to have the control of your home right on the palm of your hand?</p> <p><b>idomotics</b> is a home automation product. Apart from allowing you to turn on/off the lights, RGB lights, electrical devices, open the doors or gates, it also has a light &amp; temperature sensor to set your different rooms according to your preferences.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: left;"">Hi indiegogo. My name is Gabriel Giani. I am the CEO of idomotics.  A long time ago, I had to see my closest relatives suffer from diseases that would leave them bed-bounded. My grandfather, who had Parkinson disease, was in bed for many years, and then my dad, battling against cancer, spent his last days on a chair where he used to be hours demanding things from us, such as turning on the lights or opening the blinds.</span><br/></p>
<p>How many people with disabilities, impaired mobility or terminally ill spend their last days unceasingly depending on someone else to help them?</p>
<p>For this reason, considering that the percentage of elderly people or with impaired mobility requiring assistance is considerably high, and that it’s likely that most of us will unavoidably get to that point somehow, we thought it was necessary to give more technology to our home, making it more comfortable. And this way, we saw we could offer from the pure eccentricity of having an intelligent home to the basic need of turning on the lights for an elderly person or with impaired mobility.</p>
<p>These amazing opportunities led us to develop a product which allows you to control any electrical device in your home using the smartphone, and soon using the Smartwatch.</p>
<p>This way, the lights, gates, irrigation systems, heaters, air conditioners, RGB lights, are about a touch on the phone of distance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Imagine the amazing change we could make for a person with impaired mobility, letting him/her turn on the lights, using idomotics.</p>
<p>Imagine a recent mother with her baby living on the second floor and having to open the door to her friend. She doesn’t have to go downstairs anymore. She could just use idomotics</p>
<p>Imagine a country house perfectly warmed for us. We could turn on the heater a few hours before arriving, using idomotics.</p>
<p>idomotics is highly committed to help improve the quality of life to those who need it the most. For this reason, for every 20 kits we sell, we will donate 1 kit to a foundation, for these people to have a more comfortable living.</p>

Have you ever left your home and forgot to turn off the coffee maker? Have you ever been too tired to get up from bed and turn off the light? Have you ever wished to have the control of your home right on the palm of your hand? idomotics is a home automation product. Apart from allowing you to turn on/off the lights, RGB lights, electrical devices, open the doors or gates, it also has a light & temperature sensor to set your different rooms according to your preferences.








Hi indiegogo. My name is Gabriel Giani. I am the CEO of idomotics.  A long time ago, I had to see my closest relatives suffer from diseases that would leave them bed-bounded. My grandfather, who had Parkinson disease, was in bed for many years, and then my dad, battling against cancer, spent his last days on a chair where he used to be hours demanding things from us, such as turning on the lights or opening the blinds.
How many people with disabilities, impaired mobility or terminally ill spend their last days unceasingly depending on someone else to help them?
For this reason, considering that the percentage of elderly people or with impaired mobility requiring assistance is considerably high, and that it’s likely that most of us will unavoidably get to that point somehow, we thought it was necessary to give more technology to our home, making it more comfortable. And this way, we saw we could offer from the pure eccentricity of having an intelligent home to the basic need of turning on the lights for an elderly person or with impaired mobility.
These amazing opportunities led us to develop a product which allows you to control any electrical device in your home using the smartphone, and soon using the Smartwatch.
This way, the lights, gates, irrigation systems, heaters, air conditioners, RGB lights, are about a touch on the phone of distance.

Imagine the amazing change we could make for a person with impaired mobility, letting him/her turn on the lights, using idomotics.
Imagine a recent mother with her baby living on the second floor and having to open the door to her friend. She doesn’t have to go downstairs anymore. She could just use idomotics
Imagine a country house perfectly warmed for us. We could turn on the heater a few hours before arriving, using idomotics.
idomotics is highly committed to help improve the quality of life to those who need it the most. For this reason, for every 20 kits we sell, we will donate 1 kit to a foundation, for these people to have a more comfortable living.







We combined Software & Hardware, making a system easy to install, accesible for everyone and simply charming, to give a touch of technology to the world that surrounds us.


idomotics consists of controllers to connect lights or electrical devices to your smartphone, to control them using your smartphone, no matter where you are.











idomotics has a gateway that you need to connect to your home’s router. Then the controllers are connected to the light switches or to the electrical devices you wish to control, and using a software SERVER in a tablet that remains indoors, you can have access to every controller, from an Android or iOS smartphone.









































                                                  
 


You can get the STARTER KIT, which contains 2 light controllers (plus one sensor each), 1 RGB controller and 1 plug, to have any electrical device automatised. This way, you can start installing idomotics in the living room and the kid’s room, and then the garden and the kitchen. 







idomotics adapts to your requirements. You can set up the KIT as you wish:









idomotics does not depend on the Cloud to work. This way, the security and privacy of your home are protected on the Tablet which acts as the SERVER.



idomotics does not have a ‘black box’. Therefore, the company does not recall information about the client and the actions taken in the house.



The software has a simple interface for every member of the family to use it.








The sensors automatically adjust the air conditioner and the heater to the         temperature you prefer, as well as the light in the room.




               YOU choose who can see and have access to your idomotics WiFi. 















 














    



Our team is made of 8 fantastic people, dedicated to the innovation of technological products and passionate about new technologies.
















Q: Do I need internet to use idomotics?

A: idomotics system does not require internet to work if you are in your house. However, if you leave, you will need internet.

Q: Does the kit include a tablet?A: No. The tablet (which will be the SERVER) must be provided by the user.


Q: Can I use the tablet which will be the SERVER while idomotics is working?A: Yes. But the SERVER has to remain open and the Tablet should not be turned off.


Q: Do I have to change the structure of the wall to install the controllers?A: No. Light controllers go behind the light switch, therefore no wall breaking is required.


Q: Can I install the controllers myself?A: We recommend a suitable qualified person to do it.


Q: How many controllers can I install in my house?A: As many as the lights or electrical devices you want to control.


Q: How many controllers can I connect to the central?A: All the controllers you wish to install can be connected to the central.


Q: Can I use a computer as the server?A: No. The Server must be Android.


Q:Do I have to charge the controllers or change the batteries?A: No. The controllers do not have batteries to change or charge.


Q: How many centrals do I need in my house?A: It is recommended one per floor if it is a house of many floors or an office, for example.


Q: Does it work only in houses or can I install it in bars, schools, hotels, etc?A: You can install idomotics anywhere you want.


Q: Can I use the traditional light switch once idomotics is installed? A: Yes. Traditional light switches keep on working. 


Q: How many users can be connected to the server?A: As many as you allow to.

Employers are able to choose from a talented pool of GIGsters (service providers) to outsource work on demand.Freelancing, when done right, can bring flexibility to the home front, freedom to choose who you work with and, for the seasoned practitioner, it can also bring a higher income than that earned in a regular full-time job. However, not all is rosy and green. All marketplaces need standard rules of engagement. When everyone is trying to bid at the lowest prices for gigs, GIGsters are often making illogical wages and require some form of protection.GIGCO is born out of necessity to allow the genuine gig economy to thrive. To truly value talent.GIGCO strives to provide freelancers with Jobs, Training and Community. Our Values:

Protect and humanise the gig workforce with equitable wages and logical work hours 

Nurture the continuous development of talent through training and workshops with guidance from professionals and experts who can help fine tune and hone their skills 

Foster a sense of belonging to a community where GIGsters can come together to do bigger and greater things and achieve the unimaginable.


 
GIGCO 1.0 Marketplace for JobsGIGCO is the perfect marketplace for all sorts of jobs where freelancers (GIGsters) can pick and choose and select the jobs of their choice. Jobs can come to them from any part of the world and payment done easily through established payment gateways (e.g. PayPal).Employers (GIGmakers) save time and money finding talent across 300 skill set categories to outsource job needs. They browse online to find talent, see ratings, recommendations and complete projects within their budgets. The mobile app is available on both the Google Play Store and Apple App Store and allows posting jobs and working on gigs from the convenience of the mobile phone.    Within 30 days of its launch, our mobile app ranked 103 in the business app category on the Apple App Store. GIGCO BRAND AWARENESS1. GIGCO at Echelon Asia Summit 2018 (28th & 29th June 2018)GIGCO made its first real splash at this start-up convention – even before it was formally launched. 2. GIGCO was invited to participate in Mendaki's MSENSE Career Fair  (12th & 13th Oct 2018)Dr. Mohamad Maliki Bin Osman, Singapore’s Minister of State, engaged GIGCO executives to better understand GIGCO’s on demand job portal and app.  3. GIGCO was invited by Singapore Enterprise Association to participate in  SMEs Digitalisation Transformation event (1st Nov 2018)We were given a booth to promote GIGCO to their attendees of over 300 SME CEOs & Managing Directors from diverse industries. 4. GIGCO Superheroes Fly About - Episodes 1, 2 & 3: GIGCO is probably the only company in the world with real live superheroes to showcase that people can do extraordinary things almost as if you had superhuman capabilities. This is because the GIGCO platform will take away the mundane tasks of organising schedules, negotiating on prices and working seamlessly in communities allowing one to focus on delivering world class jobs at a greater capacity.
 

 GIGCO Superheroes sharing love for the Freelancer community TRAINING  GIGCO provides workshops and training sessions open to all in response to industry needs. GIGCO trainers are some of the most well-respected professional photographers, videographers, narrators & models. However, they need a proper studio to continue to impart their professional knowledge and expertise. Here's an example of an end state result of a property walk-through video professionally produced by GIGCO GIGsters: videographer, model, narrator and scriptwriter.

The best innovation in Online Digital Presence has arrived!
We provide a one stop platform for you to grow and enhance your business with your own Website, Marketing Funnel and Native Mobile App. You can build them ALL with AppZoola.
We'd love your support to help take bring it to the millions of businesses out there.

 



AppZoola is an online platform where you can build an Amazing Website, add a Marketing Funnel  with built in A/B testing, and build your own Native Mobile App to showcase your business's awesomeness.  All this from one platform at a very affordable price.  Customers can choose to pay by either by monthly subscription, or a reduced Annual subscription.
No coding knowledge is necessary - its all simple drag and drop.  You can select from our beautiful pre-built themes,  and even modify them to suit your needs. 

It's simple to build on AppZoola. Have a look at the just one of our video tutorials which demonstrate just how easy it is!

If you are not that technologically minded, we can also build it for you.
You will love our affordable monthly subscriptions too, and if you are looking at long term savings, then our reduced annual subscriptions will suit you perfectly.
We know you want to be a great success, whether you are a small or medium size business. Now you can expand into the online world without breaking the bank. We want to help you build your Website, Funnel and Mobile App so you can focus on what is most important - your business.
 
Features
Some of the amazing website features include:

An Online Store where you can sell physical products, Digital products or subscriptions
In built funnels for marketing with A/B testing to test your advertising campaigns.
Widgets for every purpose
Use our domain or connect your own domain.
Inbuilt SEO
Multi lingual site
EU Cookie and GDPR Compliant
Connect external apps, Facebook, Mailchimp, your own email server and more.
Create Pages and Popups with ease.
and much more..


 

So what's unique about AppZoola?

Other Website Builders don't offer you a NATIVE Mobile App. 
Other Website Builders don't offer you a built in Marketing Funnel.
Other Mobile App builders don't offer you a Website or Funnel.
Other Funnel Builders don't offer you a Website and Mobile App.

Up to now, you would have to pay separately for each of them. AppZoola gives it all to you in a single subscription, from a single platform.

You can mix and match:

A Website starting at £4.60 ($5,99) per month
A Website with Funnel starting from £11.60 ($14.99) per month,
If you include a Mobile App, you only add an additional  £12.30 ($15.99) per month. 
Or you can have just a Mobile App on its own for only £19.30 ($24.99) per month.

 

All our development has been completed, and we're in the final testing stages now, with a go live date of the 5th November 2019.
AppZoola has taken close to 6 months of long hours of work, but finally we are almost ready to launch. Our roadmap for the future includes adding more modules, additional templates,  additional industry specific builders and a whole host of amazing features to make your Website, your App and your Business even more awesome.

 

We are looking to raise £30,000. So what do we need funding for?  We want to get the word out there, and so we need to market AppZoola to a wider audience. We'll advertise on Facebook, YouTube, Linkedin and Instagram - but we'll need your help to do this.
We will use a portion of the funding for additional development, but this will only take place when we reach 100% of our goal.

 

 
As an early backer,  the perks  include:

Reduced Website Subscription for one year.
plus a FREE subscription to the mobile App Builder for one year.


Your contribution will help the millions of small to medium businesses who simply don't have the knowledge, or means to:

build an amazing Website.
create a Funnel to market their product.
plus have a  truly Native Mobile App. A traditional native Mobile App alone can cost many thousands of dollars to build.

We bridge that gap and make it affordable for anyone to have all three.
 
 


Our biggest hurdle is to build a community of subscribers.  We can overcome this through advertising, and with your help, we can tell the world about the awesomeness of AppZoola. 

Our other challenge was to ensure a good strong stable platform, Our current platform now has a 99.9% track record of stability and uptime, so you are free to focus on growing your business.

</div></div>","Your Planner is with You Everyday & You want to be Sure it is the Right One! This is the Way to take control of your 2018!
No app, no list, no chart can replace the effectiveness of a Paper Planner! And no other Planner can compete with the neuroscience embedded into ""Your Life Planned Your Way"". Because the ONLY way to get YOUR (life) time back is to PLAN ON IT.


We've got bad news for you - if how you Plan, Manage Yourself or Manage Your Time is the same way as last year, you will have the same productivity, distraction and procrastination issues as last year. 
BUT we've got great news for you too!  There is a way now to create precise visions and strategies that move you forward in life! There are powerful secrets to achieving success on your terms!  Pledge now! This is a life changing, 21st Century, 5th Generation of Time Management and YOU want to have it. 

We recommend the Double Planner Perk. All successful people have 2 Planners: A Personal one filled with Pleasure Time Activities & a Professional one for Goal Achieving Activities. 
Go beyond just ""realistic goals""! Craft and reach those that are most motivating!

As a Corporate Trainer, Executive and Entrepreneurial Coach for 25 years, I have seen the evolution of personal and professional development, as well as what works and what doesn't. 
Your Life Planned Your Way is about YOU since YOU are the REAL PLANNER! And this Process is ONLY available here!

The Process of Pre Planning to Plan ""Your Way"" is based my research and experience as a neurobiology therapist. 
Whether you want to lose weight, find love, change jobs or increase your finances, when you plan on it ""your way"" you are more likely to get it.  Imagine the shift when you increasing your productivity at work to free up your time to pursue the things that bring meaning to your life! 

You have been taught Planning tools based on the 19th Century Industrial Revolution and outdated 20th Century Time Management strategies.  And haven't you noticed the increase in burn out, stress, depression. There's a reason! The ""old ways"" don't work to help the human being! So we believe there's a better way - Your Life Planned Your Way which offers the most advanced, yet simplest, most natural, and accessible way to manage yourself, your goals and plans! You've never seen anything like it!


Or everyone would be reaching their goals! The New Way is Your Life Planned Your Way. And Pre Planning is KEY.




Albert Einstein sais: ""If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.""
Is it worth your time to get the the right questions so you can get the best results?

So many people have turned to technology to schedule, keep track of and manage their time. We think some technology makes our lives easier, but not when it comes to personal productivity! The endless maze of apps, notifications and other interfaces just create more confusion, distractions and scattered attention.

The “old way” of paper planning has been taken to an “new level” with Your Life Planned Your Way. Always on paper with the addition of the most effective proces to reach your goals and feel accomplished everyday.
You will have people asking you... ""How do you do it all?""

Use your Planner to structure your time optimizing that spent at work to free up more time to be with those you love. 

And to take up hobbies and to get exercise. With specific tracking pages you see how realistic you are with your time, where it is wasted and how to best manage what is a fixed routine and what is your flexible schedule.

<h3><strong>Need more detail on what the module is capable of?  </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Here is the techno speak:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Device Summary: </strong> </p>
<p>The Konnected-SIM4 is a high performance mission critical enterprise grade rugged router with a cellular embedded LTE Advanced (LTE 2) modem that supports LTE bands B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B7, B8, B12, B13, B17, B20, B25, B26, B29, B30 &amp; B41. It is made for customers that want the best signal reception and speed. Since this router has band 12, customers using the new 700Mhz frequency will get the best performance. This module also supports Carrier Aggregation. Carrier Aggregation is like having 2 modems in 1 device as it bonds and connects multiple times to the provider to get the fastest and most stable connection possible with the lowest latency. </p>
<p>Made to work for M2M applications, the Konnected router packs a powerful punch with its 2 x 5dBi wifi external antennas that are able to push the wifi signal as far as possible while maintaining the fastest speeds. Also includes 2 x 5dBi 3G/4G/LTE external antennas for the cellular signal that are able to get the strongest signal reception possible. </p>
<p>The Konnected SIM-4 is a completely remotely managed network device. 99% of the time we package the device with T-mobile but do have options for AT&amp;T and Verizon.  </p>
<p>Want to actually earn money with your internet service? We have software that creates a captive portal with the ability to monetize the service that you provide to others. We handle all of the technical details, money collection and revenue share with you. You are able to control access times, bandwidth and data limits for each user.  </p>
<p><strong>Advanced Wireless Security  </strong></p>
<p>The Konnected-SIM4 creates a secure Wi-Fi® network by supporting the latest wireless security features to prevent unauthorized access. It supports many security options including 64/128-bit WEP, WPA, and WPA2 + more commercial grade security options to ensure that you will be able to secure your Wi-Fi network, regardless of your client devices. In addition, the 3G/4G/LTE mobile router utilizes dual active firewalls (SPI and NAT) to prevent potential attacks from across the Internet.  </p>
<p><strong>Easy to install and Use  </strong></p>
<p>Simply receive the device and plug it into power (12VDC and 110VAC versions available). The system comes ready with a data account and preset to the SSID and Password of your choosing. For those that use the router in a critical situation, enable the Watchdog system that will reboot the router automatically if there is a loss of an internet connection.  </p>
<p><strong>Feature Details:  </strong></p>
<p>• Built in 3G/4G/LTE Cellular Embedded Modem with multiple LTE bands that supports LTE, xLTE and LTE2 (LTE Advanced)  </p>
<p>• Carrier Aggregation support to get the fastest speeds possible (up to 300Mbps download and 50 Mb/s upload using latest cat 6 module)</p>
<p>• Band 12 support for T-Mobile customers looking to get the best coverage possible using the new 700MHz band  </p>
<p>• Wireless Bridge/Repeater mode to extend your wireless range and/or have the ability to use an Ethernet connection with any wifi signal including those from a hotspot device  </p>
<p>• Konnected to Konnected VPN mode to allow a secure encrypted connection between offices • Super Fast (wireless speeds up to 300Mb/s full N speeds) up to 1000 ft range  </p>
<p>• Virtual Private Network (VPN) + OPENSWAN IPSec and OpenVPN Support  </p>
<p>• Multi-Wan with fail safe (if one connection fails, can set to auto connect to another)  </p>
<p>• WiFi Fail Over (great for boater or anyone that gets free wifi and only use 4G/LTE when not in range)  </p>
<p>• Detachable 7 inch 5dBi antennas allowing flexible gain performance antennas both wifi and 4G/LTE  </p>
<p>• Dynamic DNS full support including customized option  </p>
<p>• Available Ethernet out cable to attach to wired network</p>

As we become more and more dependent on it we as becoming more aware of the vulnerability of the present Internet environment, especially with Internet of Things (IoTs).There is a growing need as we are becoming aware that if one of the world greatest unauthorized surveillance agency would not prevent from being hacked, how can we protect ourselves. More troubling is most entities on the Internet had been hacked, one form or another, including our financial institutions. What Is the Significant of Internet 2.0
 Cyberspace Is InsecureThe reason current Internet will forever be vulnerable to hacking is due to the fundamental design of the Internet system. In order to survive nuclear attack, the Internet was designed and operated using connectionless broadcast transmission and implements static Internet addressing for transmission. Said data delivery scheme is similar to the postal delivery system.Using static Internet routing addresses and cast mode of data delivery, hackers capitalize on it to target and capture data packets, as well as, for clone others’ IP addresses for intrusive attacks. 
Internet 2.0 – Multimode InternetThe need for privacy and security will inevitably usher in a new transformative technology to fulfil such need, a more secure Internet whereby we can held hackers accountable for their actions in Internet 2.0, a multimode Internet could be such a solution.The Internet 2.0 is the brainchild of Alex Lee Chooi Tian. He invented a new set of network protocol suite for enabling Internet-like and Web-based capability natively over any telecommunication systems without using the Internet platform.A new transmission media network protocol known as Transmission Media Adaptation Layer (TMAL) was created to enable Internet 2.0. Internet 2.0 is able to provides both dedicated-media and private mode of communication for internetworking environment, coined as Virtual Dedicated Media Internet (VDMI), as well as having the ability to provide connectivity to existing Internet services. For further technical detail, please refers to US Pat No. 9,866,499 B1, entitled “Apparatus and Methods for Multimode Internetworking Connectivity”.Current Internet does not operate natively on the telephony system, instead the Internet piggy-back on it. This rendered the present Internet unable to fully capitalize on the capabilities of the telephony systems. With security-enabled Internet 2.0, VDMI is able to fully capitalise on inherent strengths of telephony systems to provide for private line of communication and reliable call tracing and recording, enabling cyber-security enforcement. What is DNS?The two most important components for the Internet to function effectively are: IP suite of protocols and Domain Name System (DNS). In addition to the differing data delivery systems, there is a need for ease of use and access to said multimode internetworking platform and environment.  Why Do We Need TelephonyDNS?While computer identifies and associates any end-nodes to numbers, we are more accustomed to associate any entities with names. There is a need for human-to-machine interface for associating network device numeric addressing to domain name in both, IP-based and VDMI environment. IP-based DNSIP-based Domain Name System is for the mapping of domain name to an IP address.  It’s Resource Record Table was developed to register a domain name either IPv4 or IPV6 numeric addressing.   TelephonyDNSVDMI network platform would require similar capability. IncepXion DNS Holdings Limited is presently undertaking to develop telephony-based DNS, where a VDMI’s domain name will be mapped to a telephony number. said telephony-based DNS is coined as TelephonyDNS. Differentiating TelephonyDNS From IP DNSFor ease of usage its imperative to mimic existing DNS domain name naming convention as must as possible. The objective is not to have two different name for any entity associated to a domain name. We did it by incorporating an invalid IP-based DNS character to our embodiment. Should the domain name preceded with a “+” character, the domain name query will be routed to TelephonyDNS resolvers. Otherwise it would be routed to the current DNS as shown below. Telephony-based DNS PerksThe followings are the reward perks for your support in this revolutionary project. Thank you.  Project TimelineTelephonyDNS registration when launched, will be temporary be hosted in a “sandbox” environment for a short period of time.  During that period, we will give our Backers the opportunity to register their preferred name for their companies, business entities, and the likes, before the others. The types of top level domain name categories are similar to that of the present IP-based DNS.Thus, backers of TelephonyDNS will have the opportunistic chance, as well as, choice to obtain great domain name in the Internet 2.0 environment. Key Personnel Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)Q1.  Is TelephonyDNS the same as IP Telephony, aka, “Enum”?No, Enum or IP Telephony provides the means to maps a telephony number to IP Address and utilizes said IP address for routing. Enum does not provides for the ability to natively maps a telephone number to a domain name.Whereas Telephony DNS provides means to maps a telephony number to a domain name. For TelephonyDNS, IP address was neither catered for nor implemented. Q2.

<p>Arrim ONE supports both Imperial &amp; Metric Unit System. You can measure in ft, inch, yard, mm, cm, and m. And you can also choose the maximum precision.</p>
<p>Arrim ONE has only one physical button for power on/off. All the controls and display are done over the phone. It means we can continuously improve the performance and add new features by only updating the software.</p>
<p>The smart phone has already become the center of our digital life. It has powerful CPU, large display, and is connected to the Internet all the time. Working with a smartphone allows Arrim ONE to instantly have all of them. So users can precisely conduct multi-functional measurements, can review the results on the large screen, and can easily share the results with others.</p>

<h1><b>ACCURACY</b></h1>
<p>ARRIM ONE has the precision of +/- 1.5 mm within 20 meters range*. To achieve this level of accuracy, ARRIM ONE uses a series of sophisticated technologies, including virtual 3D coordinate system, Phase-shift laser measurement, Characteristic point tracking, Augmented Reality, and our patented algorithm.</p>

<p>In some cases, ARRIM ONE can achieve the level of precision which is impossible for other tools. For example, if you want to measure the radius of a circle, because you are not sure where the circle centre is, the measurement with other tools may lead to a large deviation. ARRIM ONE can easily solve the problem with an algorithm based on the principle of three points defining a circle.</p>

ARRIM ONE is the first AR multi-functional measuring device that actually works. Simply attach ARRIM ONE to your smartphone. It immediately transforms your phone into a powerful AR measuring device.
FUNCTIONS
Arrim ONE is truly multi-functional. It can be used to measure the dimensions of straight lines, circles, angles and curves. It is also a leveling and dividing tool.

 
MEASURE STRAIGHT LINE


 

MEASURE CIRCLE

 
MEASURE ANGLE


LEVELING & MULTI-SECTION

 
There are much more functions, such as continuous measurement, curves, unit conversion. And many new functions will be added in the future. 
We just add an update of Floor Plan function. It is still early development version, but you will get the idea how it works.

 

Arrim ONE supports both Imperial & Metric Unit System. You can measure in ft, inch, yard, mm, cm, and m. And you can also choose the maximum precision.
Arrim ONE has only one physical button for power on/off. All the controls and display are done over the phone. It means we can continuously improve the performance and add new features by only updating the software.
The smart phone has already become the center of our digital life. It has powerful CPU, large display, and is connected to the Internet all the time. Working with a smartphone allows Arrim ONE to instantly have all of them. So users can precisely conduct multi-functional measurements, can review the results on the large screen, and can easily share the results with others.
Demo (Raw footage)

  

ACCURACY
ARRIM ONE has the precision of +/- 1.5 mm within 20 meters range*. To achieve this level of accuracy, ARRIM ONE uses a series of sophisticated technologies, including virtual 3D coordinate system, Phase-shift laser measurement, Characteristic point tracking, Augmented Reality, and our patented algorithm.

 
In some cases, ARRIM ONE can achieve the level of precision which is impossible for other tools. For example, if you want to measure the radius of a circle, because you are not sure where the circle centre is, the measurement with other tools may lead to a large deviation. ARRIM ONE can easily solve the problem with an algorithm based on the principle of three points defining a circle.

Recently, there are a few AR measuring apps on the market. However, if you have ever tried them, you would find out that they are just a concept demo. As they all depend on the software hit-test results, the precision is not reliable at all.

the Problem?</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Today 30 year old ""free standard control &amp; copy everything protocols"" are
inside every device, being hacked and hijacked every day. Their delays &amp;
remote copies drop your signal quality and Increase Your Data Cost (50-80%),
open many many outside access ports into your device &amp; make you wait on
everything. ""These regulators protocols"" and browser hijacks cost
users billions of data $$$ extra per month, lower quality &amp; billions are
hacked using these slow, regulated codes.</span></p>
<p><b>""Any  intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex.

<p><b>How Do You Solve this Problem?</b></p>
<p>Get
professional infrastructure technologists to build a wait-state-less,
12X faster smart device to device, direct software control system that produces a 300%
more bandwidth efficient encrypted signal for clean communications. Bonuses Include, weapons grade encryption at less than 1/2 the others unsafe data
rates, Go 48kHz Audio, 100% of Human Hearing Range Calls over 2-3-4G WiFi or any connection while others send as little as 17% of human hearing range. Encrypt, random rotate keys, &amp; scramble every packet. Make
sure access requires your device, password &amp; user name, All at Once (Unlike
""The Others""). Stop powering others copies, go private, low data, higher quality and direct to friends and associates.</p>

Meet Our Founders:
After
decades building advanced computing technology, our founders wanted a better way to communicate. Private clear voice
calls, HD video conferencing & faster streaming over low-cost, low speed connections. We decided to build a new communication system for friends, family and businesses. After 5 years of self-funding, design and programming the no wait state engines required, we are ready to launch and seek your crowdfunding support. 
                 

Norm Towson started building telegraphs and radios in 4th grade, helped build a computer in high school, started programming & building mini computers in college &
never stopped. Since, nearly 100 products including: 1st fail safe computer system, 1st battery powered portable PC (Pivot), 1st high storage capacity PC, 1st zero wait state PC
(Silicon Valley Computer) &
1st all in one single board PC (Intel). His last product: US Patent
8073675, disk storage computer on chip, is now used by YouTube, Netflix &
Amazon to store-stream HD videos & movies worldwide.  
Ted Rybicki, began working on ham radios, repairing and manufacturing computers in high school and college. During his 26 year career at HP; he became an HP Fellow and co-inventor of communications and security hardware, software, firmware & protocols for: HP printers, computers, routers, network controllers, switches & internet attached storage. President; HP HAM Radio Club, Audiophile, Guitarist, Order of the Arrow & Eagle Scout.


Norm, Ted & Team are committed to deliver VOVIE to the world. Over 30 years we have enjoyed building technology products for; HP, IBM, NASA, JPL, Intel, MIPS, ARM, Seagate, Cisco & others. 
Our team plans to
deliver all goals to the world. However, without your funding help, it will
take us much, much longer. Your donations allow us to hire more engineers, launch, on more devices, add more features and service you better. Together we will make secure high performance, low
cost communications a reality.

FAQ
Why
are we doing this?  
We love delivering wait-stateless computing technology. Our team simply wanted everyone to
have better, safer and lower cost communications: clearer calls, HD video chats, fast share/play of videos, photos & music, over low cost
connections, without disconnects, high bandwidth cost & spying of existing communications suppliers today. VOVIE is the 1st direct network transport for people.


What is

open many many outside access ports into your device & make you wait on

Most cloud storage providers, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, supports data encryption (storing and transferring). However, the encryption protocol is not as secure as we expected and cloud providers can read our data anytime. That's why Edward Snowden discourages Dropbox and Dropbox Head also suggests us to do encryption ourselves.

Furthermore, from January to June 2014, Google alone received 31,698  government requests for information affecting 48,615 user accounts. In 2014, Dropbox received 275 government requests. Beside that, Snowden unveils NSA and state-level spy programs in which tells that anyone can be watched by government because of their present on the cloud. 




what's safebox

Your experience may be attending shows and being wowed by the performance, the lights, the staging, the soundscape and the story. But have you ever wondered how it all happens?  We all know about the director and the actors, but for the most part we don’t stop to think about the people behind the scenes that make it all happen, and that is how it should be. If you as an audience member were sitting there thinking about the lighting operator pushing buttons or the crew shifting scenery, then we as stage professionals have failed to create magic.</p><p>Having said that, for the purpose of this campaign I need to fill you in on some behind the scenes secrets. The stage manager on the book has one of the most important roles in the production of theatre. The prompt book is the version of the script that the show is run from. From the very beginning the “stage manager on the book” or DSM (Deputy Stage Manager)/PSM (Production Stage Manager) is responsible for circulating all the information each department needs throughout the rehearsal process. They sit in rehearsals and take down the actors’ movements as directed, called blocking. They take line notes to disseminate to the actors so that they may be word perfect. They track scene changes, props, write down cues for lighting and sound, and all other technical aspects, and they even sometimes make the coffee and sweep the rehearsal room floor!</p><p>DSM/PSMs are the first to arrive and the last to leave meaning their days often last 14 hours or more in a 6-day week. They don’t get breaks, and through it all they smile. Once the show moves out of the rehearsal room to the stage, the stage manager on the book is in charge of cueing all the technical aspects of the show. They have to practice to get the timings right to create the director’s vision.  Calling a show is an art form.</p><p>Until now, all this note taking and paperwork has been done by hand with ring-binders, reams of paper, pencils, erasers, late nights, and lots of caffeine.  For years stage managers have discussed the dream of creating their books digitally. They already use laptops in rehearsal to write lists and reports, and send emails, but the prompt book is still done by hand. Some of the younger stage managers are desperate to make the shift to digital prompt books and are using between 6 – 8 apps to achieve this; apps that are not designed specifically for theatre.</p><p>BlockIt will achieve everything in one app with the ability to disseminate information to the production team and acting company. </p><p>The beauty of BlockIt is that it is not just for show! It is a highly sophisticated notation tool allowing the user to upload and notate on any document, allocate tasks, and share information.  I see it being used by students, educators, filmmakers, and event managers. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. It will have features that anyone can use and enjoy.</p><h3> </h3><h3>BlockIt Features</h3><ul>

</ul><p> </p><h3>What Others are Saying</h3><p><i>""As an instructor of theatre I try to keep my students abreast of the new technology that is constantly making theatre easier and more streamlined. Theatre technology advances so quickly it is almost difficult to keep up. Every area, that is, except stage management. I have been warning my students for many years to be on the lookout for a computer based option for stage management, but it simply hasn't come. BlockIt is exactly what I've been waiting for. The ability to keep a digital prompt book will not only bring stage management into the 21st century, but it will allow my students to work in a format that is common and understandable.

</ul></div>","Short SummaryIf you do not work in theatre, you may not know much about stage management. Your experience may be attending shows and being wowed by the performance, the lights, the staging, the soundscape and the story. But have you ever wondered how it all happens?  We all know about the director and the actors, but for the most part we don’t stop to think about the people behind the scenes that make it all happen, and that is how it should be. If you as an audience member were sitting there thinking about the lighting operator pushing buttons or the crew shifting scenery, then we as stage professionals have failed to create magic.Having said that, for the purpose of this campaign I need to fill you in on some behind the scenes secrets. The stage manager on the book has one of the most important roles in the production of theatre. The prompt book is the version of the script that the show is run from. From the very beginning the “stage manager on the book” or DSM (Deputy Stage Manager)/PSM (Production Stage Manager) is responsible for circulating all the information each department needs throughout the rehearsal process. They sit in rehearsals and take down the actors’ movements as directed, called blocking. They take line notes to disseminate to the actors so that they may be word perfect. They track scene changes, props, write down cues for lighting and sound, and all other technical aspects, and they even sometimes make the coffee and sweep the rehearsal room floor!DSM/PSMs are the first to arrive and the last to leave meaning their days often last 14 hours or more in a 6-day week. They don’t get breaks, and through it all they smile. Once the show moves out of the rehearsal room to the stage, the stage manager on the book is in charge of cueing all the technical aspects of the show. They have to practice to get the timings right to create the director’s vision.  Calling a show is an art form.Until now, all this note taking and paperwork has been done by hand with ring-binders, reams of paper, pencils, erasers, late nights, and lots of caffeine.  For years stage managers have discussed the dream of creating their books digitally. They already use laptops in rehearsal to write lists and reports, and send emails, but the prompt book is still done by hand. Some of the younger stage managers are desperate to make the shift to digital prompt books and are using between 6 – 8 apps to achieve this; apps that are not designed specifically for theatre.BlockIt will achieve everything in one app with the ability to disseminate information to the production team and acting company. The beauty of BlockIt is that it is not just for show! It is a highly sophisticated notation tool allowing the user to upload and notate on any document, allocate tasks, and share information.  I see it being used by students, educators, filmmakers, and event managers. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. It will have features that anyone can use and enjoy. BlockIt Features

 What Others are Saying""As an instructor of theatre I try to keep my students abreast of the new technology that is constantly making theatre easier and more streamlined. Theatre technology advances so quickly it is almost difficult to keep up. Every area, that is, except stage management. I have been warning my students for many years to be on the lookout for a computer based option for stage management, but it simply hasn't come. BlockIt is exactly what I've been waiting for. The ability to keep a digital prompt book will not only bring stage management into the 21st century, but it will allow my students to work in a format that is common and understandable. My methods of teaching stage management have left the old ways of taking notes with a pencil, contacting people through snail mail, and sharing information via pigeon holes and have turned to digital document formatting, what font to use when typing notes, and how to compose an email, but the prompt book has remained the same; a format my students simply don't work with anymore.

<h2>Producktiv</h2>
<p>At Producktiv, we are developing user-friendly productivity software that works like a fitness tracker for your work day. </p>
<p>We leverage research on workplace efficiency and human behavior, as well as peer accountability, to make your computer-based work time up to 20% more efficient.</p>
<p>That's like having an extra day each week. Think about what it would be worth to you if you could get everything done in up to 20% less time?</p>
<p>Because right now, our team has a beautiful working prototype of an easy-to-use app that is designed to do exactly that.</p>
<p>Our mission is to create a world where everyone is empowered to do their best work, get more done in less time, and have fun doing it</p>
<p>Existing productivity apps help you block websites, make lists, or manually enter in everything you’re doing so the app can summarize it back to you;</p>
<p>Producktiv is different because it automatically tracks your activities, provides reports to tell you stuff like how many hours you spent on email last week, and actually tells you what to do differently to maximize your productivity-- stuff like “9:00 AM is your most productive hour of the day, so maybe don’t schedule meetings then...”</p>
<p>The other thing it does is let you share your scores with friends, team members, or collaborators so you can get the motivation of social rewards, accountability, and friendly competition when you want it, or switch all that off and keep everything private if that works better for you.</p>
<p>When you fire up the Producktiv app, your dashboard gives you a quick view of your productivity score, most productive times of day, break-downs of your activity (by day, week, month, or quarter)- or you can tab through to see what your connections are doing:</p>

<div><p>Features</p></div>
<div>
<p>1) The application monitors productivity and measures the time you spent on all applications on your computer allowing you to see where you are wasting time and when you are performing at peak efficiency.<br/>2) Producktiv uses our proprietary algorithm to provide you with a producktivity score based on how you spent on your day. This score is customizable based on the specific activities that are most important to your work.<br/>3) The application will utilize these data and proprietary analytics to allow users to turn data into insights so that users can see not only what they are doing, but how to improve their workday and make themselves more efficient. <br/>4) The application will provide positive messaging, rewards, and/or badges for performing well to provide you with a positive feedback-loop to continue to reach your goals (coming soon).<br/>5) The application will leverage opt-in social accountability so you can share your performance with peers, colleagues, and co-workers when you want to motivate each other or spark friendly competition; you can also keep everything private when that works better for you (coming soon; privacy is always the default for new users).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>What all this means is that Producktiv can give you back up to 8 hours each week at very low cost-- for most of us that’s better than a 100X ROI-- for some of us it's a lot better...</p>
<p>More importantly, when you add up that extra time - it can mean you make it to the gym more often, finish that project you never get to work on, or make it home for dinner every night</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why Us?</h3>
<p>1) Producktiv's proprietary algorithm and unique design make the app smarter, easier, and more customizable than existing tools.<br/>2) Unlike existing website blockers and employee monitoring software (which are designed to constrain user autonomy), Productive puts you in the driver’s seat. Our customers want to crush it at work, and we build tools that empower them to create an optimal balance between work, meetings, relaxation breaks, physical activity, and life outside of work. This commitment to user autonomy is designed to make Productiv rewarding and enjoyable to use, while enabling improvements that help your whole team.<br/>3) Producktiv will be designed to have customizable sharing (controlled by you) so that users can leverage transparency and accountability across teams, projects, and networks in the way that works best for them (coming soon). This makes Producktiv more social than existing solutions, while protecting privacy when you need it.<br/>4) We have a team of talented individuals who understand the need for a product that helps top performers get better; we are driven to continuously identify new ways to improve our product, better serve our users, and deliver massive value while recognizing that many of the most productive people take regular breaks, connect with others, and actually love what they do.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a donor to Producktiv, you will be helping a team of entrepreneurial students and faculty from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill fulfill our goal of helping as many people as possible get more done in less time, and have more fun doing it. We truly believe Producktiv is a tool that can improve work-life balance and allow people to have more time to do do their best work and live their best lives, by creating an extra day in the week.</p>
<p>In addition, we are currently pursuing partnerships with organizations that deliver safe water to communities in need, freeing up households to spend less time carrying water and more time on school, work, and life, so they can create an extra day in their weeks as well. This means your support can benefit you, your team at work, and populations in need of accessible safe water.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We can and currently are beating the big guys at fulfillment, meaning our clients can compete by providing SAME DAY delivery and pick up for e-commerce in Ottawa.  How did I get here?</p>
<p>I studied and worked in the Indigenous justice system for 20 years.  This included government and non-profit work.  I am a comedian and speaker and write for CBC radio.  The next step was OBVIOUSLY to start a delivery and eventual logistics company.  </p>
<p>Perhaps not as obvious :)  See, in 2013 I left  Correctional Service Canada, or some might say I escaped!  Yes boo, bad joke but see, we do what we can to take the efficient but monotonous world of logistics fun!  Yes fun!</p>
<p>Digressing, my husband and I began working for our local Friendship Centre, and unfortunately due to funding cuts we both lost our jobs the same week!  I had just finished gastric bypass surgery (lost 210 lbs, yes you may applaud) and looked at my husband and said ""oh dear, we should, do something to make money for ourselves"".  </p>
<p>Not only were we unemployed but one of the reasons we left the government was I needed balance to raise our three children adopted from foster care.  We raised them from ages 4,5,6 and anyone who has gone through older child adoption will understand that at work you have to take calls all day from social workers, doctors, teachers, and eventually police officers!  Knowing this, we said ""we need to start our own company"" and wanted to figure out what we could do that used my management skills and my husband's ability to do what I say!  (kidding, he never does!)  So we had a car, I knew people and poof, we started a business in one day.</p>
<p>We grew, and let me tell you, in four years I feel like I have taken an MBA.  I have learned some key things:</p>
<p>-Remittance is a real thing, do not delay!</p>
<p>-Get an accredited bookkeeper, not one that will embezzle</p>
<p>-Surround yourself with like-minded hustlers figuring life and entrepreneurship for themselves.</p>
<p>So here we are, four years later in the fastest growing industry due to Covid, so why are we here on a platform asking for money?</p>
<p>Good and relevant question, see, we are not here for just us, but because we have built something that can help local businesses compete on a large level with the Big Guys by offering same day fulfillment and delivery at a fair price.  This is why we are here, but read more below, just know that as a person and company our testimonials speak for themselves.  We have worked hard, learned everything the hard way and are now positioned to help others have great success and that's where we need you.  If I was better at business from the beginning I am sure I'd have money to do this myself, but what can I say?  They sure don't teach business skills at while getting one's Bachelor of Human Justice at the University of Regina!  So here we are...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for contributions adding to $25,000 to help onboard new businesses to our fulfillment centre.</p>
<p>Wait what?  That's it?  That's not very groundbreaking Jenn...</p>
<p>Ok critical inner voice and ""mom"", I hear you but keep listening to why IT IS SO GROUNDBREAKING.</p>
<p>1.  Small businesses have been hit HARD this year.  During the first lockdown when Amazon and other Big Box stores had order after order in record-breaking numbers, questions were asked: ""why not support local??""  The reply was always ""not convenient and not fast"".  We have the answer.</p>
<p>2.  Small businesses who want to take the plunge into fulfillment and compete with the Big Guys will have to pay for start up fees.  This is standard.  There are inventory costs, scanning and adding to the warehouse system.  The fees may be from $30-$500 depending on the size of the business.  It may not seem like much, but to them at this time, it is everything.  That is an amount keeping the employer's lights on, internet on and staff on the payroll.  Every.  Penny.  Counts.</p>
<p>3.  We are offering small perks, basically, as money is collected we'll pay it to a small business that you have, individually or a group, sponsored.  You will get a certificate and be part of that business's success.  Yes, we will track and we will share!  Success for them means success for everyone!</p>
<p>4.  We have built the fulfillment centre and had been negotiating with a large partner that didn't pan out, but we believe it is for the best as our passion is supporting local businesses and have a platform that allows them to increase their sales and decrease their work.  They are even making money and having things sent out on their weekends or while sleeping.  It is a simple solution but sometimes, simple works!  Logistics is about NOT overcomplicating things!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Bluntly, the impact will be great for small businesses.  Yes, some may be reading and say ""hey Jenn, don't you ultimately benefit?"".</p>
<p>The answer is yes, if small businesses win so do we.  That's something I can be proud of.  By offering fulfillment at our already great rates we further reduce delivery charges and they are able to do more with less and that's a win.  We would love to start 200 new people tomorrow, but onboarding them would take a long time and cashflow that they or we don't have.  So let's work together and support a goal of 250 small businesses minimum in 45 days!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks, covid may end and shopping habits may change; however, online shopping has only increased every year, and so to has the demand for NOW and we can offer the NOW for all small businesses, seven day as week.</p>
<p>The risks are also minimized by an amazing team at Gopher It Deliveries, a passion for justice (in this case for small businesses, some who have been forced to shut down twice while large box stores stay open) and a true belief that we are making a difference.  At Christmas when we delivered package after package making people happy we KNEW we had to do more and here we are.  There are risks but they are carefully mitigated by years of mistakes and fixing those mistakes and surrounding ourselves with the best team possible!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While we will have perks and rewards, but in this covid economy we know not everyone will be able to contribute, but if you can go out and support a local business today, any of them, you are part of the solution.  We are just a mechanism to make life easier for small businesses, but it's you, I and everyone as consumers who can keep small business alive through daily shopping habits!</p>

Good and relevant question, see, we are not here for just us, but because we have built something that can help local businesses compete on a large level with the Big Guys by offering same day fulfillment and delivery at a fair price.  This is why we are here, but read more below, just know that as a person and company our testimonials speak for themselves.  We have worked hard, learned everything the hard way and are now positioned to help others have great success and that's where we need you.  If I was better at business from the beginning I am sure I'd have money to do this myself, but what can I say?  They sure don't teach business skills at while getting one's Bachelor of Human Justice at the University of Regina!  So here we are...

What We Need & What You Get
We are asking for contributions adding to $25,000 to help onboard new businesses to our fulfillment centre.
Wait what?  That's it?  That's not very groundbreaking Jenn...
Ok critical inner voice and ""mom"", I hear you but keep listening to why IT IS SO GROUNDBREAKING.
1.  Small businesses have been hit HARD this year.  During the first lockdown when Amazon and other Big Box stores had order after order in record-breaking numbers, questions were asked: ""why not support local??""  The reply was always ""not convenient and not fast"".  We have the answer.
2.  Small businesses who want to take the plunge into fulfillment and compete with the Big Guys will have to pay for start up fees.  This is standard.  There are inventory costs, scanning and adding to the warehouse system.  The fees may be from $30-$500 depending on the size of the business.  It may not seem like much, but to them at this time, it is everything.  That is an amount keeping the employer's lights on, internet on and staff on the payroll.  Every.  Penny.  Counts.
3.  We are offering small perks, basically, as money is collected we'll pay it to a small business that you have, individually or a group, sponsored.  You will get a certificate and be part of that business's success.  Yes, we will track and we will share!  Success for them means success for everyone!
4.  We have built the fulfillment centre and had been negotiating with a large partner that didn't pan out, but we believe it is for the best as our passion is supporting local businesses and have a platform that allows them to increase their sales and decrease their work.  They are even making money and having things sent out on their weekends or while sleeping.  It is a simple solution but sometimes, simple works!  Logistics is about NOT overcomplicating things!

The Impact
Bluntly, the impact will be great for small businesses.  Yes, some may be reading and say ""hey Jenn, don't you ultimately benefit?"".
The answer is yes, if small businesses win so do we.  That's something I can be proud of.  By offering fulfillment at our already great rates we further reduce delivery charges and they are able to do more with less and that's a win.  We would love to start 200 new people tomorrow, but onboarding them would take a long time and cashflow that they or we don't have.  So let's work together and support a goal of 250 small businesses minimum in 45 days!!

Risks & Challenges
There are always risks, covid may end and shopping habits may change; however, online shopping has only increased every year, and so to has the demand for NOW and we can offer the NOW for all small businesses, seven day as week.
The risks are also minimized by an amazing team at Gopher It Deliveries, a passion for justice (in this case for small businesses, some who have been forced to shut down twice while large box stores stay open) and a true belief that we are making a difference.  At Christmas when we delivered package after package making people happy we KNEW we had to do more and here we are.  There are risks but they are carefully mitigated by years of mistakes and fixing those mistakes and surrounding ourselves with the best team possible!

Other Ways You Can Help
While we will have perks and rewards, but in this covid economy we know not everyone will be able to contribute, but if you can go out and support a local business today, any of them, you are part of the solution.  We are just a mechanism to make life easier for small businesses, but it's you, I and everyone as consumers who can keep small business alive through daily shopping habits!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Olelow Decided For Itself How Much Funding It Needs To Launch</h3>
<p>Olelow itself is the one who estimated the amount of funding needed to launch.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need</h3>
<p>We have already put in $24,000 of our own money to develop the core version of Olelow.  We just need to raise $25,000 more to make it available for everyone to use.  This should cover the cost of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making Olelow Commercial Ready</li>
<li>2 Years Server Cost</li>
<li>2 Years Support Cost </li>
</ul>
<p>There will be paid and free subscription of Olelow.  The paid subscription will be priced at very low and reasonable $10 per month and $20 per month.  The free subscription will be via credits with an initial credit allocated to free users. For every new user that a ""Free User"" successfully invites to use Olelow, the Free User's credit will increase by 1. This is ideal for teachers and students wherein a teacher can invite students to use Olelow so they can get more credits to continue using Olelow for free.</p>
<p>Here are the list of features to be added:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485674170/sdbq65qbg0ixmfjees8x.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Will Get</h3>
<p>Everyone who will contribute to Olelow will get the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name or username or logo will appear in our Contributor's page that is viewable by everyone in the internet.  The first ones to contribute will appear on top of the list.  As long as Olelow is up and running, your name or logo will appear in that page. (Note:  We reserve the right to request a contributor to change his logo or username or to refund contributions for names, username or logo that may be offensive to other people or that are violating the copyrights of other people or entities.)</li>
<li>A free subscription to Olelow that you can use yourself or give it to someone else you know who you think will need it.  It can be your wife, your son or daughter in college, your best friend that is an IT professional or someone you know that have a killer app idea.</li>
<li>The ability to vote on which next features and bug fix requests to prioritize next after launching Olelow.</li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What Will Happen If We Don't Reach Our Funding Goal</h3>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goal, the funds will still be used to accelerate the development of Olelow. Even without funding, we're still continuously developing Olelow by having one developer working on it full time and me working on my free time.  This current setup works but it will take 9 months to 1 year to get Olelow to market.  We want to scale this up so that we can dedicate 3 developers working full time to deliver it to market in 3 months.</p>

<p>The risks we see here is that we might not able to raise the target funds.  This means that it will take longer than 3 months to deliver Olelow to market.  As a solution to this risk, we will also make Olelow open for seed investors that can provide large enough funds that can cover not just development cost but can also cover the big marketing cost and advance features development cost to make Olelow main stream.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you think Olelow will be useful to someone or to the world in general, please share our fund raising campaign to them using Indiegogo sharing tools.  That will greatly help to get the word out about Olelow and hopefully we can reach the target funding needed.</p>

Olelow came from the Hawaiian word Olelo which means ""to estimate"" then we added the letter 'w' from the word ""Work"".  Hence, Olelow means ""to estimate work"".

 Olelow Understands English
It uses natural language processing to read and breakdown even very large specifications written in English.  It then counts the needed code blocks to implement each section of the specification to come up with an accurate estimate.

 
Olelow Doesn't Get Tired 

Olelow doesn't mind if you make it read and analyze dozens of specifications in a day.  It will give you consistent estimate every time.
Even with a work estimation excel template, it takes hours or days to come up with an estimate.  You will need to read the specification and understand it.  It's like doing simulation coding in your mind which is very tiring.  Sooner or later you will miss some details when you get tired analyzing the specification.  Hence, most likely you will underestimate.

 Olelow Learns From Your Previous Projects
You can create or assign reference projects with your actual man-hours used to complete that project.  Olelow will learn from them and will give you an estimate that closely matches your capability.


 
Olelow Can Break It Down 

Olelow doesn't just give you the total man-hours for the entire project, it can break it down for you for each section of project specification.  You can quickly assign each section to each developer and provide them with the budget man-hours for their tasks.

Even Programmers, Administrators and Technical Support Teams don't have access to your specification.  Your specification is encrypted and stored on the server.

Olelow is Created, Maintained and Used By Actual Programmers

We at StableApps, Inc so far have completed two projects successfully all within budget using Olelow.  We have completely put our trust now on Olelow and we have stopped doing manual work estimation.

As a student, have you ever wondered how much time you should spend working on your thesis or project versus partying?  Olelow can give a student an expert opinion on how much it would take to finish their thesis or project.  This helps them plan how much hours they should dedicate every day or every week working on it.  This will save a lot of students from cramming or worst failing on their thesis or project.

How Can Olelow Deliver Accurate Results?
We used natural language processing combined with our years of software development experience and knowledge of standard software development architecture to come up with our own accurate work estimation algorithm that can take into account previous projects performance.


 
Olelow Decided For Itself How Much Funding It Needs To Launch
Olelow itself is the one who estimated the amount of funding needed to launch.
What We Need
We have already put in $24,000 of our own money to develop the core version of Olelow.  We just need to raise $25,000 more to make it available for everyone to use.  This should cover the cost of the following:

Making Olelow Commercial Ready
2 Years Server Cost
2 Years Support Cost 

There will be paid and free subscription of Olelow.  The paid subscription will be priced at very low and reasonable $10 per month and $20 per month.  The free subscription will be via credits with an initial credit allocated to free users. For every new user that a ""Free User"" successfully invites to use Olelow, the Free User's credit will increase by 1. This is ideal for teachers and students wherein a teacher can invite students to use Olelow so they can get more credits to continue using Olelow for free.
Here are the list of features to be added:

Here is Olelow's project timeline:


What You Will Get
Everyone who will contribute to Olelow will get the following:

Your name or username or logo will appear in our Contributor's page that is viewable by everyone in the internet.  The first ones to contribute will appear on top of the list.  As long as Olelow is up and running, your name or logo will appear in that page. (Note:  We reserve the right to request a contributor to change his logo or username or to refund contributions for names, username or logo that may be offensive to other people or that are violating the copyrights of other people or entities.)
A free subscription to Olelow that you can use yourself or give it to someone else you know who you think will need it.  It can be your wife, your son or daughter in college, your best friend that is an IT professional or someone you know that have a killer app idea.
The ability to vote on which next features and bug fix requests to prioritize next after launching Olelow.
Your name will have an icon showing your contributor status on every page where your username will appear.

Here's our sample Contributor's Page (All names and images there are just samples):

What Will Happen If We Don't Reach Our Funding Goal
If we don't reach our funding goal, the funds will still be used to accelerate the development of Olelow. Even without funding, we're still continuously developing Olelow by having one developer working on it full time and me working on my free time.  This current setup works but it will take 9 months to 1 year to get Olelow to market.  We want to scale this up so that we can dedicate 3 developers working full time to deliver it to market in 3 months.

Olelow Guardians
We're a team of 4 passionate programmers in StableApps, Inc.  We've been working together now for more than 2 years.  Together, we have already successfully finished and delivered more than 5 projects.  One project that we did has more than 700,000 lines of codes that is used for back testing options trading strategies.  Our client, IOTA Technologies Pte. Ltd.,  was eventually bought by Gammon Capital mainly because the back testing tool that we help  developed improved Gammon Capital's trading performance last year and second half of 2015.  If you want to read more about IOTA and Gammon Capital, please read this article:  https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/singapore-fintech-invades-wall-street-larry-richards?trk=hb_ntf_MEGAPHONE_ARTICLE_POST
I'm also a stockholder of IOTA Technologies Pte. Ltd. that is duly registered in Singapore.

Risks & Challenges
The risks we see here is that we might not able to raise the target funds.  This means that it will take longer than 3 months to deliver Olelow to market.  As a solution to this risk, we will also make Olelow open for seed investors that can provide large enough funds that can cover not just development cost but can also cover the big marketing cost and advance features development cost to make Olelow main stream.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you think Olelow will be useful to someone or to the world in general, please share our fund raising campaign to them using Indiegogo sharing tools.  That will greatly help to get the word out about Olelow and hopefully we can reach the target funding needed.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our One-For-One tree planting initiative is a good start, but creating a positive change in the lives of coconut farmers cannot be done by just sourcing coconut oil from a large manufacturer. Despite the popularity of coconut products there is very little awareness or evaluation of fair-trade standards, and farmers are severely exploited.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The problem we’re trying to solve simply needs more attention, understanding, effort, passion, and heart. Most importantly, it needs a community of great people to support a change.</p>

<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">The idyllic coconut palm setting may be extraordinary, but the industrialization of this magnificent “Tree of Life” has a troubled history, responsible for more than 60 percent of the Filipino coconut farming community living in extreme poverty. Coconut farmers exist at the subsistence level and are considered some of the poorest people in the Philippines. Their existence producing Copra at the terminal end of the coconut distribution chain often leaves entire communities <span>hopeless, as they’re most vulnerable to exploitation and environmental disasters.</span><br/></span></div>

<p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>THE SOLUTION</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The solution to many of the problems and constraints that coconut farmers face can be solved with the implementation of a hand made DME (Direct Micro Expeller) production method for Raw Organic Coconut Oil.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The method uses no fuel or other resources and is fully sustainable. There is zero waste and no negative impact on the environment. It also allows for the use of often wasted parts of the coconut to be developed into other ""downstream products"".</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">While Copra production is primarily for men, the DME process creates opportunities for both men and women, while creating a community-driven working environment tat encourages collaboration and teamwork. From the time the coconut is cracked open, it takes less than one hour to produce the finest quality Raw Organic Coconut Oil. The freshest coconut oil in the world.</p>

</h2>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;""><p style=""text-align: justify;"">By creating opportunity in a high-value market and making more effective use of the existing resource, we can work towards growing self-sustaining communities. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Much of the returns from DME Coconut Oil flow through the community, creating significant development and opportunity. When we are able to assist in the production of downstream products, additional industries are developed, reaching local and international markets.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our long-term goal is to implement 10 small batch  coconut  oil facilities in Eastern Samar. We have the infrastructure and support in place. Our focus now is on building a community and establishing our place in the market. As demand grows for Kapuluan products, we will build additional facilities to meet the demand, while strengthening our operation and significantly affecting the positive impact of our efforts all over Eastern Samar. </p></span></div>

</div></div>","WHY ARE WE CROWDFUNDING?







Our One-For-One tree planting initiative is a good start, but creating a positive change in the lives of coconut farmers cannot be done by just sourcing coconut oil from a large manufacturer. Despite the popularity of coconut products there is very little awareness or evaluation of fair-trade standards, and farmers are severely exploited.
The problem we’re trying to solve simply needs more attention, understanding, effort, passion, and heart. Most importantly, it needs a community of great people to support a change.







HOW?
WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SMALL-SCALE FARMERS TO PRODUCE THE FRESHEST COCONUT OIL IN THE WORLD, MADE BY HAND IN SMALL BATCHES







THE PROBLEMS

The idyllic coconut palm setting may be extraordinary, but the industrialization of this magnificent “Tree of Life” has a troubled history, responsible for more than 60 percent of the Filipino coconut farming community living in extreme poverty. Coconut farmers exist at the subsistence level and are considered some of the poorest people in the Philippines. Their existence producing Copra at the terminal end of the coconut distribution chain often leaves entire communities hopeless, as they’re most vulnerable to exploitation and environmental disasters.
Copra - A Vegetable oil commodity made from the dried flesh of often rotten coconuts & processed using chemicals at large factories.




















THE SOLUTION
The solution to many of the problems and constraints that coconut farmers face can be solved with the implementation of a hand made DME (Direct Micro Expeller) production method for Raw Organic Coconut Oil.

The method uses no fuel or other resources and is fully sustainable. There is zero waste and no negative impact on the environment. It also allows for the use of often wasted parts of the coconut to be developed into other ""downstream products"".
While Copra production is primarily for men, the DME process creates opportunities for both men and women, while creating a community-driven working environment tat encourages collaboration and teamwork. From the time the coconut is cracked open, it takes less than one hour to produce the finest quality Raw Organic Coconut Oil. The freshest coconut oil in the world.











THE IMPACT

By creating opportunity in a high-value market and making more effective use of the existing resource, we can work towards growing self-sustaining communities. 
Much of the returns from DME Coconut Oil flow through the community, creating significant development and opportunity. When we are able to assist in the production of downstream products, additional industries are developed, reaching local and international markets.
Our long-term goal is to implement 10 small batch  coconut  oil facilities in Eastern Samar. We have the infrastructure and support in place. Our focus now is on building a community and establishing our place in the market. As demand grows for Kapuluan products, we will build additional facilities to meet the demand, while strengthening our operation and significantly affecting the positive impact of our efforts all over Eastern Samar. 










DR. DAN ETHERINGTON
DME INVENTOR / PARTNER


HOW YOU CAN SUPPORT
Our ultimate goal is to Improve the livelihood of Coconut Farming Communities - connecting Customers with Farmers - growing a community of change for a better world.
When you contribute to the campaign you directly impact the lives of small farmers and their community. Your contribution will go towards the building of a small batch Coconut Oil production facility in Eastern Samar, Philippines. It will also extend to the equipment, training & education, the infrastructure with proven system & support, and a quality assurance program. 





Coconut trees are not only needed to help farming communities recover from the destruction from Typhoons. One of the primary constraints Coconut Farmers face is that their income is too low to invest in the planting of new trees, creating issues with sustainability and growth, perpetuating poverty. 
Planting new Coconut Trees also helps in the fight against global warming!


WHAT YOU GET 

DME Coconut Oil is the Freshest and Finest Quality Coconut Oil in the World. Handmade in Small Batches by Small-Scale Coconut Farmers







     


    
REWARDS
We’ll not only plant a coconut tree in your name but also give you early access to raw, handmade coconut oil at lower than retail prices. You’ll get to experience for yourself the benefits of DME handmade coconut oil while also playing an important role in improving the livelihoods of these coconut farmers. Ultimately, you are making this all possible.






THE SPACE
Designing and building in an impoverished rural village poses a few challenges including typhoons, rain, excessive heat, lack of electricity and water. We designed a minimal space that uses the land to keep the building cool while increasing its strength. The green roof will help deal with heavy rain and naturally filter into a water storage tank. The finishing touches will come in the form of solar panels and rain shading which will be affixed to the exterior of the building.

<h3><strong>Welcome to our campaign!</strong></h3>
<p>We are conducting this crowdfunding campaign to make it possible to further develop Ansofy, and eventually launch the app globally.  But most importantly, we want to give<strong> you</strong> the possibility to from an early stage be a member of the<strong> Global Ansofy Tribe. </strong> Our plan is to build a world wide movement, starting here and now in this crowdfunding campaign. It will be an exciting journey, and the most important part for us is to create a strong and powerful community with people around the world who are ready to stand up and defend our democratic societies. </p>
<p>If you don't want to miss the chance to be an important part in the process of reinventing the media landscape, it's time to jump on this train today!</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>A sustainable society needs trustworthy news, Global News with a broader view on what really happens. That is why we are launching Ansofy. And we want YOU to be a part of our global tribe!</strong></p>
<p>Ansofy gives you the freedom to build your own news feed and that opens up the possibility to mix different perspectives on the same news event. Instead of letting someone else decide for you what news is the most important, you can make your own digital news feed and find out more of what really happens in the world. Ansofy is a politically and religiously independent news source. We don’t need to track your profile and therefore we can offer you data privacy and integrity. </p>
<p>One of our most important missions is to <i>burst the filter bubbles and fight fake news.</i></p>
<p><strong>Ansofy </strong>gives you the freedom to build your own news feed and that opens up for the possibility to mix different perspectives on the same news event. Instead of letting someone else decide for you what news are the most important, you can make your own newspaper and find out more of what really happens in the world. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In this crowdfunding campaign our first goal is to collect 100 000 SEK, meaning roughly 11 000 USD/10 000 EUR in today's exchange rate. If we succeed with that we will be able to:</p>
<p>-  Deliver our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that will contain news and magazines from a limited amount of global sources. </p>
<p>BUT... if we exceed our first goal you can expect so much more than this! Already today we can reveal that our <strong>first</strong> <strong>strech goal</strong> is to reach 250 000 SEK, meaning 28000 USD/23000 EUR.</p>
<p>If we reach that goal we will be able to:</p>
<p>- Add more functionality to the app, for example the possibility to enjoy Ansofy without ads, access to more categories and a high amount of data privacy. With 250 000 SEK funded you'll simply get a more powerful and go-to-market ready version of our MVP.</p>
<p>AND.... we have more streach goals up our sleeve! But those will be revealed further on as the campaign moves on. To be more precise, you will find out what's included in <strong>streatch goal #2</strong> when we reach <strong>200 000 SEK funded</strong>! So please stay tuned and come back here regularly to follow our progress.</p>
<p><strong>So, what's in it for you then?</strong></p>
<p>As we've already told you this is not an ordinary campaign, it's the start of a global movement and we call for everyone who wants to fight for democracy to join our cause. But of course we have perks for you! Here are some examples on what you'll get in return when you engage in our campaign (except from meeting people with common values and join in on fun activities here on the platform…)</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our world gets more and more polarized each day. The reasons for this are many, but the change in how we consume media and the increase of conspiracy theories are both important parts of this development. Democracy depends on people knowing what is happening, and that is why we need to burst the filter bubbles and create a structural change in how we consume news. We all get different perspectives on what’s going on in the world based on the sources we follow combined with AI that gives you more of what you already have. This includes our feeds in social media and who we trust and listen to (influencers, celebrities etc).</p>
<p>Why is this a dangerous situation? We have already seen many examples on how conspiracy theories and the spread of complete lies have inspired people to do ruthless things. People around the world are being told that mainstream media is spreading fake news and that governments are the enemy. Eventually this distrust of the pillar stones of our democratic societies is questioned and seriously threatened.</p>
<p>If you don't want to miss the chance to be an important part in the process of reinventing the media landscape, it's time to jump on this train today!</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Welcome to our campaign!
We are conducting this crowdfunding campaign to make it possible to further develop Ansofy, and eventually launch the app globally.  But most importantly, we want to give you the possibility to from an early stage be a member of the Global Ansofy Tribe.  Our plan is to build a world wide movement, starting here and now in this crowdfunding campaign. It will be an exciting journey, and the most important part for us is to create a strong and powerful community with people around the world who are ready to stand up and defend our democratic societies. 
If you don't want to miss the chance to be an important part in the process of reinventing the media landscape, it's time to jump on this train today!
Short Summary
A sustainable society needs trustworthy news, Global News with a broader view on what really happens. That is why we are launching Ansofy. And we want YOU to be a part of our global tribe!
Ansofy gives you the freedom to build your own news feed and that opens up the possibility to mix different perspectives on the same news event. Instead of letting someone else decide for you what news is the most important, you can make your own digital news feed and find out more of what really happens in the world. Ansofy is a politically and religiously independent news source. We don’t need to track your profile and therefore we can offer you data privacy and integrity. 
One of our most important missions is to burst the filter bubbles and fight fake news.
Ansofy gives you the freedom to build your own news feed and that opens up for the possibility to mix different perspectives on the same news event. Instead of letting someone else decide for you what news are the most important, you can make your own newspaper and find out more of what really happens in the world. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
In this crowdfunding campaign our first goal is to collect 100 000 SEK, meaning roughly 11 000 USD/10 000 EUR in today's exchange rate. If we succeed with that we will be able to:
-  Deliver our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that will contain news and magazines from a limited amount of global sources. 
BUT... if we exceed our first goal you can expect so much more than this! Already today we can reveal that our first strech goal is to reach 250 000 SEK, meaning 28000 USD/23000 EUR.
If we reach that goal we will be able to:
- Add more functionality to the app, for example the possibility to enjoy Ansofy without ads, access to more categories and a high amount of data privacy. With 250 000 SEK funded you'll simply get a more powerful and go-to-market ready version of our MVP.
AND.... we have more streach goals up our sleeve! But those will be revealed further on as the campaign moves on. To be more precise, you will find out what's included in streatch goal #2 when we reach 200 000 SEK funded! So please stay tuned and come back here regularly to follow our progress.
So, what's in it for you then?
As we've already told you this is not an ordinary campaign, it's the start of a global movement and we call for everyone who wants to fight for democracy to join our cause. But of course we have perks for you! Here are some examples on what you'll get in return when you engage in our campaign (except from meeting people with common values and join in on fun activities here on the platform…)
- Pledge 10 EUR and get a basic membership in the Global Ansofy Tribe (including our newsletter,  early access to download the app and an invite to our members only Facebook group.)
- Pledge 40 EUR and get a basic membership in the Global Ansofy Tribe (including our newsletter, get a personal Beta test invite for our closed testflight beta test, early access to downloading the app and an invite to our members only Facebook group)
- Pledge 80 EUR and get a basic membership in the Global Ansofy Tribe (including our newsletter, get a personal Beta test invite for our closed testflight beta test, early access to downloading the app, 3 months free premium Ansofy subscription and an invite to our members only Facebook group)
- Pledge 150 EUR and get a GOLD membership in the Global Ansofy Tribe (including everything that comes with the Basic membership, an invite to our members only Facebook group + 6 months premium subscription, your name on our website and a personal video call with our CEO Theresa Weber-Quarfort where you can influence the development of Ansofy)
 

The Impact
Our world gets more and more polarized each day. The reasons for this are many, but the change in how we consume media and the increase of conspiracy theories are both important parts of this development. Democracy depends on people knowing what is happening, and that is why we need to burst the filter bubbles and create a structural change in how we consume news. We all get different perspectives on what’s going on in the world based on the sources we follow combined with AI that gives you more of what you already have. This includes our feeds in social media and who we trust and listen to (influencers, celebrities etc).
Why is this a dangerous situation? We have already seen many examples on how conspiracy theories and the spread of complete lies have inspired people to do ruthless things. People around the world are being told that mainstream media is spreading fake news and that governments are the enemy. Eventually this distrust of the pillar stones of our democratic societies is questioned and seriously threatened.
If you don't want to miss the chance to be an important part in the process of reinventing the media landscape, it's time to jump on this train today!

<h3>The Idea.</h3>
<p>Since 1999, Auriscrib CEO and founder David Akerson has worked at international organizations investigating and prosecuting genocide and war crimes.   One organization he worked at spent over two decades having its investigators and lawyers interviewing thousands of witnesses.  Most of the time, the investigator or attorney scribbled notes listening to the witness recounting their story.  Later, those notes were turned into a formal witness statement.  But because these statements were based on notes and memory, they were inaccurate and sometimes damaging to the case.  </p>
<p>In his twenty-five year working as a senior attorney and technologist investigating mass atrocities, David worked on numerous complex investigations.  He knows there is an acute need for a better tool for witness interviews.    </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Auriscrib is that tool.  It is an app that will save these organizations a substantial amount of time and money with by making the</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> process of witness interviewing cheaper, faster and better.  </span></p>
<p>It's simple.  The interviewer will use Auriscrib to securely video or audio record an interview with his phone, iPad or laptop.  Then, with the click of a button, Auriscrib uses artificial intelligence to produce an accurate transcript within minutes.  Auriscrib then synchronizes the audio of the interview to the transcript.  And Auriscrib throws in a few bits and bobs that investigators and lawyers need.  For example, if the witness has security concerns, AuriScrib can pixelate their image, distort their voice and conceal their personal information to conceal their identity.</p>
<p>Auriscrib is a much-needed tool in human rights investigations.  If we are going to end the impunity of dictators and despots who commit crimes against humanity, we need new and better tools.   </p>
<p>But Auriscrib is also needed around the world in domestic law enforcement agencies, investigative bureaus, and intelligence operations as well.  Using Auriscrib will make domestic law enforcement agencies more transparent and more accountable. </p>
<p>This campaign seeks funds to fund the development of Auriscrib.  <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I</span>nvestigators and attorneys who rely on witnesses want this tool.  And they want it soon!<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">   </span></p>
<h3>Background.</h3>
<p>In 1984, David graduated with a computer science degree.  Seeing no future in computers, he proceeded to go to law school.     </p>
<p>David's foray into the complex investigation field began in 1988 when he went to work for Lawyers for Human Rights in South Africa, a human rights organization fighting Apartheid.  Since then, he worked as a lawyer and technologist investigating conflicts all over the world, including Rwanda, Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and others.  He has also taught as a full-time lecturer at the University of Denver College of Law.</p>
<p>Because David has law and computer degrees, when he worked for international investigative bodies he tended to be involved with the IT infrastructure and workflow on top of his lawyer duties.  So he knows what lawyers and investigators need.  He understands the workflow of a complex atrocity investigation.   This has permitted Auriscrib to develop a clear and focused vision for an interview tool.   </p>
<p>Auriscrib has clear expressions of interest from several large international investigative missions, and Auriscrib will be able to generate an immediate revenue stream when the product is ready for release that should sustain its continued development and evolution.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need.</h3>
<p>Auriscrib is looking to raise $30,000 to build a working prototype of the app<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.  This will get Auriscrib into the hands of beta testers later this summer.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Auriscrib is a game changer.  It will change the way atrocities are investigated by human rights organizations and help end the impunity of perpetrators committing genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Auriscrib will help create a clear and objective record of the stories witnesses want to tell.  And Auriscrib will do it quickly and inexpensively, saving human rights organizations resources to do their important work.   </p>
<p>Auriscrib will also help to change in the culture in local law enforcement agencies to be more transparent.  Auriscrib eliminates inaccuracy and reliance on memory, creating a crystal-clear and bias-free record of interviews. </p>
<p>There are many other applications for AuriScrib.  It has many general business applications to record meetings and discussions.  Court reporters and educators could use it.  Anyone who feels like they can't effectively simultaneously take notes and carefully listen to a lecture or meeting, or anyone who wants to make sure they have a completely accurate record of a conversation -- they all need AuriScrib. </p>
<p><font><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><b>Risks and Challenges</b></span></font></p>
</div><div>
<p>There are a few competitors in the market.  Some produce AI transcriptions, others out-source transcriptions to human transcribers.  Auriscrib's strategy is to combine both of these into one app, allowing users to produce an AI transcript with a click of a button, and then click a second button if they want a professional editor (a genuine human!) to edit and polish it up.  It's the best of both worlds. </p>
<p>An additional challenge is the expectation of users that a transcript produced with artificial intelligence will be perfect.  It won't be perfect, but it will be really good - around 75% accurate.  It will be incumbent upon Auriscrib to manage the expectation of users by explaining that an AI-produced transcript that is 75% accurate is still much better than the scribbled notes and memory of the interviewer.  More importantly, Auriscrib will synchronize the audio and transcript so that, if a transcript is not accurate, the user can listen to the audio of that corresponding section of the transcript and edit as necessary.</p>
<h3>How You Can Assist.</h3>
</div><div><p>If you can't contribute, Auriscrib needs your help getting the word out.  Please pass the word about Auriscrib to any law enforcement officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense counsel or anyone else that might benefit from the automatic and accurate transcription of a recorded interview.  We would love to speak to chiefs of police, head prosecutors or public defenders, and any other decision-makers in similar kinds of enterprises.  If you know a big-wig, connect us!</p></div></div>","The Idea.

It's simple.  The interviewer will use Auriscrib to securely video or audio record an interview with his phone, iPad or laptop.  Then, with the click of a button, Auriscrib uses artificial intelligence to produce an accurate transcript within minutes.  Auriscrib then synchronizes the audio of the interview to the transcript.  And Auriscrib throws in a few bits and bobs that investigators and lawyers need.  For example, if the witness has security concerns, AuriScrib can pixelate their image, distort their voice and conceal their personal information to conceal their identity.
Auriscrib is a much-needed tool in human rights investigations.  If we are going to end the impunity of dictators and despots who commit crimes against humanity, we need new and better tools.   
But Auriscrib is also needed around the world in domestic law enforcement agencies, investigative bureaus, and intelligence operations as well.  Using Auriscrib will make domestic law enforcement agencies more transparent and more accountable. 
This campaign seeks funds to fund the development of Auriscrib.  Investigators and attorneys who rely on witnesses want this tool.  And they want it soon!   
Background.
In 1984, David graduated with a computer science degree.  Seeing no future in computers, he proceeded to go to law school.     
David's foray into the complex investigation field began in 1988 when he went to work for Lawyers for Human Rights in South Africa, a human rights organization fighting Apartheid.  Since then, he worked as a lawyer and technologist investigating conflicts all over the world, including Rwanda, Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, Cambodia, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and others.  He has also taught as a full-time lecturer at the University of Denver College of Law.
Because David has law and computer degrees, when he worked for international investigative bodies he tended to be involved with the IT infrastructure and workflow on top of his lawyer duties.  So he knows what lawyers and investigators need.  He understands the workflow of a complex atrocity investigation.   This has permitted Auriscrib to develop a clear and focused vision for an interview tool.   
Auriscrib has clear expressions of interest from several large international investigative missions, and Auriscrib will be able to generate an immediate revenue stream when the product is ready for release that should sustain its continued development and evolution.  

What We Need.
Auriscrib is looking to raise $30,000 to build a working prototype of the app.  This will get Auriscrib into the hands of beta testers later this summer.
The Impact

Auriscrib is a game changer.  It will change the way atrocities are investigated by human rights organizations and help end the impunity of perpetrators committing genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.  Auriscrib will help create a clear and objective record of the stories witnesses want to tell.  And Auriscrib will do it quickly and inexpensively, saving human rights organizations resources to do their important work.   
Auriscrib will also help to change in the culture in local law enforcement agencies to be more transparent.  Auriscrib eliminates inaccuracy and reliance on memory, creating a crystal-clear and bias-free record of interviews. 
There are many other applications for AuriScrib.  It has many general business applications to record meetings and discussions.  Court reporters and educators could use it.  Anyone who feels like they can't effectively simultaneously take notes and carefully listen to a lecture or meeting, or anyone who wants to make sure they have a completely accurate record of a conversation -- they all need AuriScrib. 
Risks and Challenges

There are a few competitors in the market.  Some produce AI transcriptions, others out-source transcriptions to human transcribers.  Auriscrib's strategy is to combine both of these into one app, allowing users to produce an AI transcript with a click of a button, and then click a second button if they want a professional editor (a genuine human!) to edit and polish it up.  It's the best of both worlds. 
An additional challenge is the expectation of users that a transcript produced with artificial intelligence will be perfect.  It won't be perfect, but it will be really good - around 75% accurate.  It will be incumbent upon Auriscrib to manage the expectation of users by explaining that an AI-produced transcript that is 75% accurate is still much better than the scribbled notes and memory of the interviewer.  More importantly, Auriscrib will synchronize the audio and transcript so that, if a transcript is not accurate, the user can listen to the audio of that corresponding section of the transcript and edit as necessary.
How You Can Assist.
If you can't contribute, Auriscrib needs your help getting the word out.  Please pass the word about Auriscrib to any law enforcement officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense counsel or anyone else that might benefit from the automatic and accurate transcription of a recorded interview.  We would love to speak to chiefs of police, head prosecutors or public defenders, and any other decision-makers in similar kinds of enterprises.  If you know a big-wig, connect us!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Good Teaching Platforms Are Far And Few! But WeYakYak Is A Very Bold And Different Podium</h3>
<p><strong>The internet boom in foreigners teaching China’s children online</strong></p>
<p><strong>Firms providing overseas internet tutors could share US$165-billion marke</strong>t<strong> in five years, says one research report, as parents look to give their children a head start.</strong></p>

<strong>Kelly Carroll </strong>has been a self employed entrepreneur for over 35 years and retired by returning to school at ITTO-TEFL to learn the skill of teaching English as a foreign language.  Not only did she graduate with the highest honor, she has been online teaching since 2016 and listed as one of the ""Most Popular"" teachers with one of the online companies she is currently working with.  Kelly's passion for her students has driven her to this innovative project because she cares about what the students want.  Not only does she care, but she wants the online learning platform to be the best on the market for teachers and students alike.  Her ideas have developed with over 650 hours of teaching online and over 100 students currently learning with her.  Kelly says "" I know what teachers want, and I know what it takes to keep a student online with you "".</li>
<li>We are going global and still in the process of bringing on more partners and investors to make WeYakYak a success.  There is more strength with more people who want to help and take on a position or role in this endeavor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up.  But pity anyone who falls and has no one to help them up.  Ecclesiastes 4:9-10</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THIS IS A GLOBAL EFFORT TO CHANGE THE WAY WE TEACH AND LEARN!</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is very important locally and globally because it impacts every teachers life and income in the world.  After living abroad Kelly learned how hard it is for teachers to make a living with low income teaching jobs.  She had every opportunity to work at CHC English School in Ecuador but instead went with online global teaching.   Why?  Everything they teach and every class is online and she was able to set her own price.  It is safe, done from the comfort of your home and there are no risks in this type of teaching/learning environment. </p>
<p>Because it is global, teachers can choose the price they want to charge according to their economies.  Some global areas are hard hit by the lack of jobs (like Venezuala, Mexico, Etc.).  Other areas in the world are being compromised by violence against teachers and students.  We can't fix this issue in our world but we can help create the alternative for teachers who love teaching.  Teachers across the globe are losing the passion they once had to care and share with students.  </p>

<p>Teaching opportunities online will open more doors for both Teacher and Student because their will be no by-laws against our teachers to follow strict and political correct jargon.  We are a Christian community that will allow a teacher to speak of God freely and give students the opportunity to share their views without attack or predjudice. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523564895/awewsqjkhipok0ozhnap.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>  Backers will help create a safe global platform for whole communities, families and students.  The main passion in WeYakYak comes from the violence and abuse that is happening in our school systems on a widespread geographical impact.  Also, this will help spur teachers to rekindle their teaching passion once again.  These kind of hurdles barricade both parties and extinguish the dedication in our teachers.  </p>

<h3>Hi my name is Harry Radford and I'm the Founder of Sixpence Industries Ltd. A startup company with plans to produce multiple new products all born from years of UK construction industry experience.</h3>
<h3><u>What is it?</u></h3>
<p>The remedial hinge: a product designed to solve the common problems associated with replacing timber doors in previously used linings, where the fixing holes are either threaded or ovalized. Our patent pending design uses eccentric inserts to rotate the fixing position to allow a secure fixing every time by screwing into fresh timber. I have also addressed the issue where a new hinge would sit short in the housing or too deep because the previous hinges were much thicker and made to a imperial measurement. By upping the dimensions both in height and width, but also depth. <strong>We aim to be retailing around the £10 mark for 3"" and £15 for 4"". </strong></p>
<h3><u>Why?</u></h3>
<p><strong>Is achieving a fixing a problem in an old lining?</strong> 100% yes. You may not know it, but many carpenters just use match sticks, golf tees, plastic raw plugs or chop sticks to avoid re-plugging and gluing or splicing a new section in. Does it work? Yes and no. In engineering terms it's hideous. In terms of fire safety, it's a huge liability, at best it's mediocre considering we're planning on sending men to Mars!</p>
<p><strong>Why make them oversize?</strong> Years ago, we built things to a imperial measurement literally millions of door linings have 3"" or 4""  housings. Fast forward to the present and we are making hinges to a metric size 75 mm and 100mm. 25.4mm to an inch = undersize. Coupled with several removals and refits and you get a pretty chewed up edge that's supposed to be holding the hinge in line. </p>
<p><strong>Why thicker?</strong> Again years ago hinges were made thicker because of less advanced production processes. These deep housings usually get packed with a menagerie of things to hand: most common is the cardboard from the new hinge box! Again in a fire situation this could be a weak link for fire to spread. It also gives the user the opportunity to completely re-seat the housing as if it's a new install, perhaps using a router and a sharp chisel rather than the shovel on the previous attempt. </p>
<h3><u>Where?</u></h3>
<p>Aimed at the service industry,  primarily fire doors in commercial properties, schools, rental properties, HMOs etc where a users primary concern is end result. There is no reason these couldn't be utilised in the domestic sector. I believe I've created a one-stop solution, suitable for both professionals and DIY users.</p>
<h3><u>What we need:</u></h3>
<h3>An ambitous £100k would get us CE &amp; BSI Certified &amp; into major retailers but realistically a mere £20k would get these to market: Amazon, Ebay, etc... </h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">After running the numbers, producing this product in the UK isn't viable, as much as I'd like to. So it's got to be produced overseas and here's the rub, where as here in the the UK the MOQ is 1000 (and the price is too high), manufacturers in China have MOQs of 10000 (or more) but the price becomes viable. The other issue is tooling which, through several design iterations, we have managed to fit into existing manufacture practices, apart from the inserts which will require the factory to have a cnc sliding head lathe. This will require some funding</span></p>
<p>So ideally I'm looking for around 100k to produce 3"" and 4"" in sizable batches with tooling, branding and distribution as well as BSI and CE approvals (but whatever I get will be used to get started). This should open the doors to large retailers and secure its future as a go-to time and labour saver that will be retailing around the £10 mark  3"" £15  4"".</p>
<h3><u>What you get:</u></h3>
<p>As of perks, the first 20 to claim this will receive an engraved set of personalised hinges. If you pledge a lot, I could send you a couple of sets. It's a labour saver, litigation saver and maybe a life saver!</p>
<h3><u>Impact:</u></h3>
<p>Your contribution will be driving innovation in a market where we see very little. Investors  generally aren't hugely interested in the construction industry even though it's tied directly to the housing market! Successful funding of this product will also mean the development of 4 other products  just waiting to bring to the world and make things easier. </p>
<p>Users will be supporting a fellow tradesman whose success is tied directly to further innovation in their industries.</p>
<p>I'm a maker not a taker. My company will be run by this motto! I'm uniquely gifted in practical problem solving. I could bore you with examples... but nobody likes a show off.</p>
<h3><u>Risks and challenges:</u></h3>
<p>With the traditionalist nature of the Carpentry industry, some may be slow to adopt the progressive nature of the product but just ask if they own a jack saw! </p>
<p>IP infringement:<strong> </strong>the objective is to bring this to market so another person doesn't have to struggle, be litigated against and possibly save the life of someone caught in a fire.</p>
<p>If it gets copied, then it further validates the concept and it's out there one way or another.</p>
<p>The challenge will be BSI testing as the manufacture method is novel but currently see no reason it shouldn't pass and I have an alternate method ready should it fail.</p>
<h3><u>Other ways you can help:</u></h3>

Don't worry, you can still get all versions of GUILIN at an amazing 30% discount while stock lasts!Below is our latest live demo on how GUILIN can reduce TVOC level even when the lamp is switched off. This means that your interior is constantly being detoxified of any VIRUS (inc. All Corona Virus), BACTERIA (inc. Salmonella + E-Coli) & POLLUTANTS (inc. Nitrogen Oxide + Formaldehyde) with GUILIN permanently. For more info on what TVOC is and why it is harmful to all of us. Please click on link below:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatile_organic_...GUILIN MAXIMUM BRIGHTNESS (best environment cleansing effect)

GUILIN MEDIUM BRIGHTNESS x NATURAL INDOOR LIGHT (good environment cleansing effect)

GUILIN POWER OFF x NATURAL INDOOR LIGHT (still sustain environment cleansing effect)

A 24 hours/365 days environment detoxification solution + its pretty, multi-award winning proven design and suits any interior or exterior spaces + does not resemble an old fashion ugly air purifier tech gadget!
GUILIN is a piece of functional illumination art that helps your well being + our planet
 
The Brighter GUILIN becomes, the better it will cleanse the environment as proven with our ground breaking Photocatalysis additive but this process is continuous even when the lamp is switched off. Our Photocatalysis process is completely safe on humans as proven by our Material Safety Data Sheet. GUILIN is designed as a ""Lampscape"" to aid the well-beings of your family:  https://www.blglab.com/in-house-scientific-datasIs it a lamp? Or a sculpture? Or both? GUILIN is most appropriately described as a ‘Lampscape’' With etched acrylic mountains that sit on an illuminated base, the Multiple Award-Winning GUILIN lights up your room with an ambient glow, while also adding sculptural beauty to one’s space… and it purifies the air too.Principally, GUILIN comes with a base that uses edge-lit acrylic mountains to disperse light around the room. The abstractly designed edge-lit mountains come made from glass-reinforced acrylic and sit within slots in a metallic base fitted with a low-voltage 2700K warm LED light. The light shines through the base and the clear mountains, bouncing off the lines etched into the acrylic…. but that isn’t all. The design also works as a photocatalytic air purifier that uses visible light to unlock certain naturally occurring minerals to cleanse the environment of impurities and toxins like 99.99% of all Viruses (including all types of Corona Virus),Bacteria, Nitrogen Oxide, Formaldehyde, Odor + Pollen Particles (scroll down and see our test data).A good example of how this works can be found right above you for roughly half a day… the sun. It uses a similar light-based treatment to enrich and elevate your surroundings, not just aesthetically, but also in a very tangible way by purifying the very air you breathe… and it does so while channeling the same sort of imagery, hence the mountain-inspired design.You can shift and orient the mountains to create a landscape that gives you calm or complements your space. You can even cleverly add more mountains to diffuse more light, much like a physical, interactive dimmer mechanism.Designed as an ode to nature and the tranquility of mother earth, GUILIN's base comes coated in environmentally friendly paint, while the acrylic mountains themselves are made from 40% recycled plastic. Place the GUILIN on a glossy reflective surface and it mimics the feeling of staring at the mountains sitting right behind a lake!

Please note that unlike most small and cheap gadgets that claims to work with the Photocatalytic process, the only solution to efficiently use this technology is based on the equation below:
*PHOTOCATALYSIS EFFECTIVENESS=Applied Surface Area + Photon Wavelength*
this is why GUILIN is designed as a rather large lamp with the 3 layering of mountains as this is the ONLY way any design can work effectively in a relatively limited area to cleanse the surrounding environment.

<h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>BarBuzz will be a reality but we need YOUR HELP to get it live! We currently have a <b><a href=""https://www.fluidui.com/editor/live/preview/p_530b9cd5c29f9f120bd52e55bf113249.1463792400084"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FUNCTIONAL MOCKUP</a><a href=""https://www.fluidui.com/editor/live/preview/p_9JpJqH4i6J95l7sbiJS9T1M6gWf7NOH8.1463092842407"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a></b>of the app which you can click through and see in action (Browser must be Chrome, Firefox or Safari to view). But getting a coded version for both iPhone and Android phones that we can test and upload to the app stores is proving costly. While we have invested close to $100K, we are looking to raise another $50,000 to finish coding, testing, secure server space (for all those photos) and get BarBuzz into your hands as soon as possible!!</p>
<p>This may seem like a daunting amount of money to try to raise – but this is an app that can literally be used from day one by anyone at any bar or club in any city in America! That’s a lot of BARS who can use this app to promote their establishments – and that’s a lot of CUSTOMERS like you who LOVE going out for a cold one or some great entertainment. Every little bit will help!</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><b>Q: Are there any cities that will not be included at launch? </b></p>
<p>A: No! Any city in the U.S. can use BarBuzz. Most bars will automatically be listed to the database, but if your bar is not listed, just add it with your company information.</p>
<p><b>Q: I’m a server and don’t want to post my real name for security reasons. Will that limit how many customers/regulars can follow me on BarBuzz? </b></p>
<p>A: Not at all. BarBuzz is set up so you can use a “nickname,” so that your full name doesn’t have to be used online. Nicknames don’t have to be unique, but we encourage you to be creative, so your regulars know it’s you. Nicknames can also be changed at any time.</p>
<p><b>Q: I’m a server and worried that posting my work schedule could be a security concern. </b></p>
<p>A: We understand! BarBuzz lets YOU decide who sees whatever information you want to post. You can even set up a default view so that all new followers of yours automatically see limited information, unless you change their “viewing profile.”</p>
<p><b>Q: In what other ways does BarBuzz help servers limit the viewing of their information and protect their privacy? </b></p>
<p>A: Using BarBuzz will actually IMPROVE privacy for servers. Currently, if you want to communicate with your regulars you have to either give out your phone number (to text), give out your last name and access to your Facebook, or other social media profile, where you also end up giving access to a great deal of your PERSONAL life. By getting customers to follow you on BarBuzz, you can separate your PERSONAL social network from your PROFESSIONAL social network. You can even create a nickname or alias for your BarBuzz profile, so you don’t have to give out your last name, if you don’t want to. If you were hesitant to broadcast work promotions on your personal social networks, now you can promote your work and communicate - individually or in groups – to the people who matter most – your customers. Using BarBuzz means more privacy and more business!</p>
<p><b>Q: If I contribute to this campaign, do I own a piece of BarBuzz? </b></p>
<p>A: No. Equity Crowdfunding is not yet allowed on Indiegogo – only Contributor Crowdfunding.  Besides, U.S. Equity Crowdfunding laws are in their infancy and are heavily regulated by the SEC.</p>
<p><b>Q: If I won’t own a piece of BarBuzz, why should I contribute? </b></p>
<p>A: If you think BarBuzz is a cool app that you and your friends would use, this is your chance to help make it a reality! By contributing via Indiegogo, you will enjoy a special VIP VERSION of the BarBuzz app, providing you with special features and discounts. Also, Contributor Crowdfunding is a great way for individuals to show their support for great new company ideas that might not get funded otherwise. </p>
<p>We think we have great BarBuzz-branded Perks for individuals or bar owners that will make you want to contribute.</p>
<p>In addition to these great Perks, once BarBuzz is a reality, individuals and bar owners will benefit just by using this great partying and marketing tool! Even if your business isn’t specifically tied to a bar, many related companies will benefit by target marketing to the customers, employees and management of bars through advertising. Examples of advertisers include alcohol and beer brands, tobacco companies, vaping brands, ride-sharing services and many more!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">A WORD ON CROWDFUNDING</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Not everyone has visited a crowdfunding site, though most people have heard about them. So here's a short recap of how they work: </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">1. Folks who have a great new product or business idea create a ""campaign"" seeking to raise a specific amount of money by a certain date (usually 30 days) to get their business going. The power of the crowd enables someone to ask for a little and get a lot (some popular campaigns become wildly successful and surpass their goals by double or triple!). </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">2. Folks who like the idea of the new business and see the value in it and want to support the creation of something new and unique will contribute to the cause. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">3. Call them ""Perks,"" giveaways, or swag - just like NPR and those famous tote bags and mugs, Indiegogo contributors receive what are called ""Perks,"" from the campaign creators, depending on the level of contribution. The Perks are listed at the top right-hand side of the campaign page and listed by dollar amount. Find a perk you would like and consider giving at that level (BarBuzz has Perks designed for Individuals and Business owners). If you wish to contribute an amount not set up as a Perk, you will get the Perk at the next lowest level to that amount - unless you specify you don't wish to receive any Perk.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">4. About two weeks after the campaign ends, the campaigner receives all the funds contributed, minus about 5% for Indiegogo and about 3% for credit card processors like Visa.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">5. The Perks are then ordered and mailed to contributors and email updates are sent out periodically, updating contributors on how the raised money is being used and when the new product or business is officially launched!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Don't forget that the BEST PERK of ALL is that you will be able to download and use this incredible new social network partying app called BARBUZZ!  And by contributing, you also get the much coveted VIP VERSION of the BARBUZZ app! Contribute now and encourage your partying friends to do the same!!!</p>

You can even create a nickname or alias for your BarBuzz profile, so you don’t have to give out your last name, if you don’t want to. If you were hesitant to broadcast work promotions on your personal social networks, now you can promote your work and communicate - individually or in groups – to the people who matter most – your customers. Using BarBuzz means more privacy and more business!
Q: If I contribute to this campaign, do I own a piece of BarBuzz? 
A: No. Equity Crowdfunding is not yet allowed on Indiegogo – only Contributor Crowdfunding.  Besides, U.S. Equity Crowdfunding laws are in their infancy and are heavily regulated by the SEC.
Q: If I won’t own a piece of BarBuzz, why should I contribute? 
A: If you think BarBuzz is a cool app that you and your friends would use, this is your chance to help make it a reality! By contributing via Indiegogo, you will enjoy a special VIP VERSION of the BarBuzz app, providing you with special features and discounts. Also, Contributor Crowdfunding is a great way for individuals to show their support for great new company ideas that might not get funded otherwise. 
We think we have great BarBuzz-branded Perks for individuals or bar owners that will make you want to contribute.
In addition to these great Perks, once BarBuzz is a reality, individuals and bar owners will benefit just by using this great partying and marketing tool! Even if your business isn’t specifically tied to a bar, many related companies will benefit by target marketing to the customers, employees and management of bars through advertising. Examples of advertisers include alcohol and beer brands, tobacco companies, vaping brands, ride-sharing services and many more!

PERK: 1.75 oz SHOT GLASS
 
 
 

 
A WORD ON CROWDFUNDING
Not everyone has visited a crowdfunding site, though most people have heard about them. So here's a short recap of how they work: 
1. Folks who have a great new product or business idea create a ""campaign"" seeking to raise a specific amount of money by a certain date (usually 30 days) to get their business going. The power of the crowd enables someone to ask for a little and get a lot (some popular campaigns become wildly successful and surpass their goals by double or triple!). 
2. Folks who like the idea of the new business and see the value in it and want to support the creation of something new and unique will contribute to the cause. 
3. Call them ""Perks,"" giveaways, or swag - just like NPR and those famous tote bags and mugs, Indiegogo contributors receive what are called ""Perks,"" from the campaign creators, depending on the level of contribution. The Perks are listed at the top right-hand side of the campaign page and listed by dollar amount. Find a perk you would like and consider giving at that level (BarBuzz has Perks designed for Individuals and Business owners). If you wish to contribute an amount not set up as a Perk, you will get the Perk at the next lowest level to that amount - unless you specify you don't wish to receive any Perk.
4. About two weeks after the campaign ends, the campaigner receives all the funds contributed, minus about 5% for Indiegogo and about 3% for credit card processors like Visa.
5. The Perks are then ordered and mailed to contributors and email updates are sent out periodically, updating contributors on how the raised money is being used and when the new product or business is officially launched!
Don't forget that the BEST PERK of ALL is that you will be able to download and use this incredible new social network partying app called BARBUZZ!  And by contributing, you also get the much coveted VIP VERSION of the BARBUZZ app! Contribute now and encourage your partying friends to do the same!!!

For the past year, </span></p><p>Epic Consumer Club been working diligently on a pilot project with over 15,000 consumers. Reaching out to over 50+ service providers in different industries: from telecom, to large food chains, insurance companies, car manufacturers, health insurance providers, pharmacies and many more.  </p><p>Results have been extremely promising, where the average consumer in our network reduced their bills by over 40%, saving close to 1000$ in 6 months.  </p><p>We believe that it is time that we offer these savings to the rest of the world and start fighting back against the rising cost of living.

Indeed, negotiations with the large corporations can take time and many weeks to come through. For example, we have successfully negotiated a package with a large gas station franchise where they will plant a tree everytime one of our members will go fuel up with them. However, the negotiations took almost 2 months and a long waiting time from their executive and CSR teams. </p><p>On the other hand, there is also some risk that the development and the production of the mobile application may take longer than expected.

  By harnessing the power of our group purchasing community and the interconnectivity of our consumer network, we are driving down the cost of essential utilities such as Household goods, Gas, food, telecom and anything else our community is working on.  Our consumer community, acts as a single large purchasing unit. As a simple consumer, large corporations would never consider offering you the best deals or packages possible at the most reasonable prices. This innovative will provide a platform for all consumers, delivering seamless communication across a distributed web of service providers and retailers. DISCOVER WHAT OUR COMMUNITY IS WORKING ON Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Telecommunications Gas Stations Groceries and Retail Stores HOW WILL THE EPIC CONSUMER APP WORK?It provides you with a platform where you will be able to:
Connect with your fellow EPIC CONSUMERS (10,253 and growing)
Access to webinars, briefings, infosession on consumer oriented subjects
Listing of all fulfilled and upcoming projects and negotiations
Platform where all EPIC Consumers will be able to start their own campaign
Platform to start your own socially responsible campaign
Geo location for all projects near you (I.e. who is working with our community close by?)
Does it sound too easy? Well, we have worked really hard to make it easy for you, so EVERY ONE of us can become EPIC CONSUMERS without having to leave their household or drastically change their lifestyle :) WE STAND TOGETHER AS EPIC CONSUMERSIf we want things to change, we need to push for change together. The larger the community, the bigger the changeIn an increasingly open, digital world where authenticity is the buzzword of choice, EPIC CONSUMER believes that businesses must keep up with growing demands for ethical behaviour and transparency in everything from:
EMPLOYEE RIGHTS
TRANSPARENCY
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY
ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT
EPIC CONSUMER believes technology is the key to dealing with these social challenges. Open data, social networks and mobile tech can change the game.Which is why this year, we have embarked on turning our findings into a social movement/community, creating a platform, empowering consumers and businesses to take steps towards being socially responsible to their customers. FEATURES BENEFITS  OUR PILOT PROJECTOur team here at Epic Consumer Club is dedicated to lowering the cost of living for all consumers. For the past year, Epic Consumer Club been working diligently on a pilot project with over 15,000 consumers. Reaching out to over 50+ service providers in different industries: from telecom, to large food chains, insurance companies, car manufacturers, health insurance providers, pharmacies and many more.  Results have been extremely promising, where the average consumer in our network reduced their bills by over 40%, saving close to 1000$ in 6 months.  We believe that it is time that we offer these savings to the rest of the world and start fighting back against the rising cost of living. We’ve proven that this concept works and we are ready to streamline the process, providing this opportunity to all consumers out there. RISKS AND CHALLENGESKARBON BUSTERS is a relatively simple concept and is already proven through our broad base membership of approximately 10,000 members across Canada, but more specifically Quebec and Ontario.The primary risk that we could encounter would be the delay in negotiating the packages and deals with the large corporations. Indeed, negotiations with the large corporations can take time and many weeks to come through. For example, we have successfully negotiated a package with a large gas station franchise where they will plant a tree everytime one of our members will go fuel up with them. However, the negotiations took almost 2 months and a long waiting time from their executive and CSR teams. On the other hand, there is also some risk that the development and the production of the mobile application may take longer than expected. Coordinating with the developers and maintaining quality throughout every step is a challenge.Fulfillment becomes a hurdle when dealing with system integration and compatibility through several operating systems. We will not rush through these steps and will tackle them carefully, one by one. We will take our mobile application to the design for development step in June 2017, and the target is to have it ready to go by August 2017.Our goal is to grow our membership base across Canada and the US, which will provide us with a better ability to develop new target markets and negotiation opportunities.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li><p><strong>Pagas más por el comportamiento de otros.​</strong><br/>Cuando el huésped de ""pesadilla"" destruye una habitación de hotel, roba batas de baño, se va sin pagar, etc. aumentan los costos de los hoteles. (Una encuesta reciente estimó que los viajeros alemanes por sí solos robaron mercancías por un valor de 37 millones de euros en el 2013. Tabla a continuación). Estos costos se pasan a usted, el huésped respetuoso de la ley, al aumentar las tarifas de habitación y eso no es justo</p></li>

<strong>Arruinar sus vacaciones</strong><p>¿Quién entre nosotros no ha encontrado al huésped desagradable en una de nuestras vacaciones? Los huéspedes con malos comportamientos pueden arruinar nuestras tan duramente trabajadas y anheladas vacaciones. Personas ebrias gritando en el pasillo en medio de la noche, gente escuchando música a alto volumen en la piscina como si no hubiera nadie más, familias tratando las zonas públicas como si fueran el basurero del barrio ... la lista sigue y sigue</p>

<li>Huéspedes problemáticos no enfrentan absolutamente ninguna consecuencia por sus acciones. Pueden hacer actos de vandalismo, robar, ser irrespetuoso con el personal u otros huéspedes, salir sin pagar y luego cruzar la calle a otro hotel. Nadie sabrá jamás sobre su ""historia"" pasada.<br/> </li>

It's not going to happen that quickly.The Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu said: ""A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step"" and we humbly would like to add that it is probably the first step that is the hardest. We have already taken that first step and now we would like you to accompany us in taking the next few onesTHE GUEST SIDE

You are treated according to previous experiences the accommodation provider had with your compatriots. When we travel, we are not referred to by our first name but by our Nationality. The Britt, the American, the Aussie etc. When one Britt leaves a bad impression, the next Britt will be treated accordingly and although these problematic travelers/tourists are the minority, the impact they leave is much bigger than their proportional size. With their foul actions they stain us all.

You pay more for others behavior.When the ""nightmare"" guest trashes a hotel room, steals bathrobes, leaves without payment etc they increase the hotels costs. (A recent survey estimated that German travelers alone stole goods worth of 37 million euros in 2013. Table below). These costs are passed on to you, the law abiding guest,  by increasing room rates and that's not fair

Ruin your vacationWho among us hasn’t encountered the obnoxious guest in one of our vacations? Badly behaving guests can ruin your hard worked and long waited for vacation. Drunk people shouting in the corridor in the middle of the night, people playing loud music by the pool as if no one else is around, families treating public areas as if they were the neighborhood garbage dump....the list goes on and on
 THE HOTEL/HOSTEL SIDE
Third party review sites such as Tripadvisor, Expedia, Zomato, Hostelworld  and Yelp and many others, encourage potential guests to read about and rely on previous guests  experiences before making their decision.  What about the hotels? Why can they not rely on other hotels experience before making their decisions to accept guests or not and under which conditions? 
Problematic guests face absolutely no consequences for their actions. They can vandalize, steal,  be disrespectful to either staff or other guests, check out without paying and then cross the street to another hotel.  No one will ever find out about their past ""history."" 
Reviews and criticism are the best ways to let hotels know what things they are doing well and what things they need to improve. However, some guests misuse the power of a review as a way to “blackmail” a hotel, shamelessly asking for upgrades or discounts in exchange for not posting a negative review. 
With WhosYourGuest.com registered Hotels and other players in the Hospitality business have the ability to do the following:

 Search 
Search on a guests history before accepting their reservation


Report problematic guests:
After filling guests details, hotels and lodging facilities will be able to report the circumstances of a case. Each report is reviewed by  Whos Your Guest to make sure it complies with our reporting guidelines and receives a qualification score from 1, (minor things like “no shows”), to 5, (serious things like theft or leaving without paying).

 Hotels who receive reservations from reported guests will have the option to accept the reservation, accept with security measures like advance payment, charge more for the room because of the risk factor or decline the reservation.For severe cases in their area Hotels also receive an alert by Email.Whos your guest is already changing the conversation, relations and the way accommodation providers are communicating  with their guests.                       Imagine a world where people care for each other, respect local cultures and their people, and treat those around them with equality, consideration, and kindness.  .....wow, we want to live in such a world.By helping us to ensure that the only people who pay the consequences for the actions of inconsideration are the problematic guests themselves, we will be ""eliminating"" or reducing the negative in the tourism industry and the rest of us will be able to enjoy more our travels. This will be our little step toward living in a better world.  As a platform WYG has no legal liability for information published by its users.  Hotels and Hostels are responsible in obtaining the information from the guest in a legal way. (signed authorization)WYG is  responsible for the storing and the use of this information between its members.  WYG provides members with complete information and legal support about the requirements of the law in order to report problematic guestsAs much as possible....:-) This is how Whos Your Guest? will use the funds; according to priority:
A professional website that has the capability to allow members to search reported guests database and to send automatic alerts in case of new reports. The main emphasis will be on data protection technologies and a user-friendly interface - $20,000 
Legal assistance, verifying laws of different countries, writing user contracts etc. - $12,000

Orientation campaign for participating hotels and establishments regarding the legal obligations related to the collection and handling of personal information providing the required legal instruments needed to fulfill all obligations - $10,000

Expanding services to additional countries, searchers, data base builders, client service, graphic designers etc. -  from $15,000

Internet advertising (Facebook, Google etc.) - $15,000

Office space, salaries, overhead, etc. are all covered for the near future
All funds collected will be distributed according to the specifications illustrated above. The more funds we are able to procure, the more we can grow the business model, expand to other countries, and improve the level of services we offer. Any funds received above the above-stated amounts will be used toward the creation of a social network for hotels and hostels which is part of the bigger vision we have but it's still not the time to reveal it all...:-)When donating, if possible, please use the credit card option instead of the paypal, as with paypal there is an extra charge for us to receive your donationIf you are a big time investor, or know one, and realize the potential of this project, please drop us a line so we can chat further Since we are an internet platform we don't have any physical products to sell or give as perks at a discounted price. However, we know that bakers looove perks so we turned to the Hotels and hostels members of our network and they were more than happy to help. Most perks you will find following were donated by one of our members as a sign of their satisfaction and appreciation for the noble idea behind WYG. This also explains why most are available in Ecuador, Panama or Colombia......:-)             The dream teamCEO and founder - Inbal Tubi:   My name is Inbal, only 48 years, married + 2. Now I’m supposed to say my profession and nationality. I have a problem defining both.Let’s start with the profession. If it is defined but what you studied than since I’m a graduate of Ben-Gurion University in Israel with a degree in Economics and Business Management I guess I’m an economist. If it is defined by what you make you’re living from than since I have been owning hostels for the last 15 years I guess this makes me and independent business men. If it is defined by what you did most of your life, what you love and passionate about than since I have been traveling for the past 20 years, been to 83 countries, 6 continents and speak 5 languages I guess this makes me a traveler and globetrotter. If I have to choose between the three, that last one wins by far.Now for the Nationality. If it is defined by where you were born than, I’m Israeli. If it’s defined by your passports, than I’m also Brazilian. If it’s defined by where your heart belongs, than I’m African, if i t's defined by where you live now than I'm Colombian and if it’s defined by where you feel at home than I belong everywhere. Personally, I don’t like definitions because they are limiting, so I like to think of myself as from everywhere and nowhere.I have worked in almost all possible jobs there are. From frying French fries in NY, a fabric warehoused and a human dishwasher in Australia, selling jewelry on the streets of Japan, marketing manager for the wealthiest company in Israel with frequent travels abroad to owning and running a hostel in Brazil and just sold another one I had in Bogota, Colombia where I live today, to finance Whos Your Guest.  Unfortunately my dad could not give me a ""small loan"" of one million dollars  like Trumps dad did and funds are running out so I am depending on your generosity to help me continue with this very important project. In my spare time, I dream and plan my next travel. Final goal in life if to color every country on the world map tattooed on my back  CMO - Yahav Cohen            My name is Yahav, 33. playing on the internet and trading fields for over 10 years. but my big passion is to own and work on my own Permaculture farm.Meanwhile, my wife and I raise two kids a Doberman 3 chickens and two ducks in our urban garden.Build and launched an e-commerce art related website, taking part in a restaurant service startup.love to travel, snowboarding, camping and relax in my hammock after a long week.  COO - Motti Mor    My Name is Motti Mor. I am a 37 year old dreamer and website designer. I have been wondering in the internet realm since the beginning of the internet era and started designing websites some 15 years ago.My dream was always to work while I travel and I've followed it for many years and visited many parts of our exciting and beautiful planet.Nowadays, I've decided to stay in one place for a while. I am raising my two beautiful sons and hold an MBA degree focused on Web Marketing.I have met Inbal in NY about 20 years ago and ever since we have been walking side by side. I've joined  the "" Whos Your Guest"" project to try and make this world a just and better place.                 and the list can go on and on and on..............  Interesting statistics and reads:The most common offenses reported on our database:Booking sites problematic guests use:The top 10 Countries With Notoriously Bad TouristsTheft of hotel items: 4.5 million Germans do it / 1.3 million stolen towels​There are many ways you can help us to reach our goal and make your next vacation more pleasant (and hopefully cheaper too!)Here are three of them:

          When you travel and see someone behaving badly dont just ignore it. Let the hotel managment know about Whos Your Guest and the actions they can take.Thank you so much for your help and support!       El objetivo final de Whos Your Guest es eliminar la necesidad de Whos Your Guest. Sí, lo leíste correctamente, queremos sacarnos a nosotros mismos del negocio ….:-) Pero, antes de poner tu mano de vuelta en tu bolsillo, espera un segundo. No va a suceder tan rápido.El filósofo chino Lao Tzu dijo: ""Un viaje de mil millas comienza con un paso"" y humildemente queremos añadir que es probablemente el primer paso el que es más difícil. Ya hemos dado ese primer paso y ahora queremos que nos acompañes en dar los próximosEL LADO DEL HUÉSPED

Usted es tratado de acuerdo a experiencias anteriores que el proveedor de alojamiento tenía con sus compatriotas. Cuando viajamos, no se refieren a nosotros por nuestro nombre sino por nuestra nacionalidad. Cuando un Britt deja una mala impresión, el próximo Britt será tratado en consecuencia a ésta y aunque estos turistas/viajeros problemáticos son la minoría, el impacto que dejan es mucho más grande que la proporción de su tamaño. Con sus malas acciones nos manchan a todos.

Pagas más por el comportamiento de otros.​Cuando el huésped de ""pesadilla"" destruye una habitación de hotel, roba batas de baño, se va sin pagar, etc. aumentan los costos de los hoteles. (Una encuesta reciente estimó que los viajeros alemanes por sí solos robaron mercancías por un valor de 37 millones de euros en el 2013. Tabla a continuación). Estos costos se pasan a usted, el huésped respetuoso de la ley, al aumentar las tarifas de habitación y eso no es justo

Arruinar sus vacaciones¿Quién entre nosotros no ha encontrado al huésped desagradable en una de nuestras vacaciones? Los huéspedes con malos comportamientos pueden arruinar nuestras tan duramente trabajadas y anheladas vacaciones. Personas ebrias gritando en el pasillo en medio de la noche, gente escuchando música a alto volumen en la piscina como si no hubiera nadie más, familias tratando las zonas públicas como si fueran el basurero del barrio ... la lista sigue y sigue

 EL LADO DEL HOTEL/HOSTEL
Terceros sitios de crítica/revisión como TripAdvisor, Expedia, Zomato, Hostelworld, Yelp y muchos otros, alientan a posibles clientes a leer y confiar en las experiencias de huéspedes anteriores antes de tomar su decisión. ¿Qué pasa con los hoteles? ¿Por qué ellos no pueden confiar en las experiencias previas de otros hoteles antes de tomar sus decisiones para aceptar huéspedes o no y bajo qué condiciones?
Huéspedes problemáticos no enfrentan absolutamente ninguna consecuencia por sus acciones. Pueden hacer actos de vandalismo, robar, ser irrespetuoso con el personal u otros huéspedes, salir sin pagar y luego cruzar la calle a otro hotel. Nadie sabrá jamás sobre su ""historia"" pasada. 
Comentarios y críticas son las mejores maneras de hacer saber a los hoteles qué cosas están haciendo bien y qué cosas necesitan mejorar. Sin embargo, algunos huéspedes usan mal el poder de una crítica como una forma de ""chantaje"" un hotel, descaradamente pidiendo mejoras o descuentos a cambio de no publicar una crítica negativa.
Con WhosYourGuest.com  los hoteles registrados y otros jugadores en el negocio de la hospitalidad tienen la capacidad de hacer lo siguiente:

 Buscar 
Buscar en la historia de huéspedes antes de aceptar su reserva


Reportar huéspedes problemáticos:
Después de diligenciar los detalles de los huéspedes, los hoteles y establecimientos de alojamiento serán capaces de reportar las circunstancias de un caso. Cada reporte es revisado por Whos Your Guest para asegurarse de que cumple con nuestras directrices de reporte y recibe una calificación de 1, (cosas menores como ""no shows""), a 5 (cosas serias como robo o salir sin pagar).

 Los hoteles que reciben reservas de los huéspedes reportados tendrán la opción de aceptar la reserva, aceptar con medidas de seguridad como pago por adelantado, cobrar más por la habitación debido al riesgo o rechazar la reserva.Para casos severos en su área, los  hoteles también reciben una alerta por correo electrónico.Whos Your Guest ya está cambiando las conversaciones, las relaciones y la forma en que los proveedores de alojamiento están comunicándose con sus huéspedes.                      Imagine un mundo donde la gente se cuide el uno al otro, respete las culturas locales y su gente, y trate a los que les rodean con igualdad, consideración y bondad…. wow, queremos vivir en un mundo así.Al ayudarnos a asegurar que las únicas personas que paguen las consecuencias por los actos de desconsideración sean los huéspedes problemáticos por sí mismos, estaremos ""eliminando"" o reduciendo lo negativo en la industria del turismo y el resto de nosotros podremos disfrutar más nuestros viajes. Este será nuestro pequeño paso hacia la vida en un mundo mejor.  Como plataforma WYG no tiene ninguna responsabilidad legal por la información publicada por sus usuarios.Los hoteles y hostales son responsables de obtener la información del huésped de manera legal. (Autorización firmada)WYG es responsable del almacenamiento y el uso de esta información entre sus miembros.WYG proporciona a los miembros información completa y apoyo legal sobre los requisitos de la ley para informar a los huéspedes problemáticosTanto como sea posible .... :-) Así es como Whos Your Guest? Utilizará los fondos; por orden de prioridad:

Asistencia legal, verificación de leyes de los diferentes países, redacción de contratos de usuarios, etc. - $ 12,000

Campaña de orientación para los hoteles y establecimientos participantes con respecto a las obligaciones legales relacionadas con la recolección y manejo de información personal proporcionando los instrumentos legales necesarios para cumplir con todas las obligaciones - $ 10,000

Esto también explica por qué la mayoría están disponibles en Ecuador, Panamá o Colombia ...... :-)The dream teamCEO y Fundador  - Inbal Tubi:​   Mi nombre es Inbal, sólo 48 años, casado + 2. Ahora se supone que tengo que decir mi profesión y nacionalidad. Tengo problemas para definir ambos.Empecemos con la profesión. Si es definido por lo que estudié, entonces desde que soy graduado de la Universidad de Ben-Gurion en Israel con un título en Economía y Administración de Empresas supongo que soy un economista. Si se define por lo que hago para vivir, desde que he sido dueño de hostales durante los últimos 15 años, supongo que esto me hace un hombre de negocios independiente. Si se define por lo que hice la mayor parte de mi vida, por lo que amo  y me apasiona, desde que he viajado por los últimos 20 años, he estado en 83 países, 6 continentes y hablo 5 idiomas, supongo que esto me hace un viajero y trotamundos. Si tengo que elegir entre los tres, éste último gana por mucho.Ahora por la nacionalidad. Si se define por donde nací, entonces soy Israelí. Si está definido por sus pasaportes, entonces también soy Brasileño. Si se define por dónde pertenece tu corazón, entonces soy Africano, si es definido por donde vives ahora  entonces soy Colombiano y si se define por donde te sientes como en casa entonces yo pertenezco a todas partes. Personalmente, no me gustan las definiciones porque son limitantes, así que me gusta pensar en mí como de todas partes y de ninguna parte.He trabajado en casi todos los trabajos posibles que hay. Desde la fritura de papas fritas en Nueva York, un almacén de telas y un lavavajillas humano en Australia, la venta de joyas en las calles de Japón, gerente de marketing para la empresa más rica en Israel con viajes frecuentes al extranjero, a ser propietario y dirigir un hostal Brasil y acabo de vender otro que tuve en Bogotá, Colombia donde vivo hoy, para financiar a Whos Your Guest. Desafortunadamente mi papá no podía darme un ""pequeño préstamo"" de un millón de dólares como el de papá de Trump hizo y los fondos se están acabando así que estoy dependiendo de su generosidad para ayudarme a continuar con este proyecto tan importante.En mi tiempo libre, sueño y planeo mi próximo viaje.

CAROMELL -
ein Hausfloß für alternatives Leben
Who are we?We are CARO and MELLI, two
students of architecture from Berlin, Germany but more importantly, close friends. As a
conclusion of our master's program we want to relive all building phases: from
conceptual design to realization - with minimal budget! We want to design
according to the design-build concept and cooperate with many project partners
to design, plan and build. Like that we built a school in Cameroon in 2013-15.
We consider it as important to present less glossy concepts, but rather to
transmit a sense of awareness: how one wants to live and how one collects own
experiences to understand the world individually.Wer sind wir?Wir  sind CARO und MELLI, zwei Architekturstudentinnen aus Berlin, Deutschland, 
aber viel wichtiger, enge Freunde. Als Abschluss unseres Masterstudiums wollen
wir vom konzeptionellen Entwurf bis hin zur Realisierung noch einmal alle
Bauphasen durchleben - mit minimalem Budget! Wir möchten nach dem
Design-Build-Konzept gemeinsam mit möglichst vielen Projektpartnern entwerfen,
planen und bauen. Damit haben wir Erfahrung, denn 2013-15 bauten wir so in
Kamerun eine Schule.

Wir erachten es als wichtig, weniger fertige Hochglanzkonzepte zu präsentieren,
sondern vielmehr ein Gefühl zu vermitteln, sich dessen bewusst zu werden, wie
man leben möchte und somit dem Betrachter die Chance ermöglichen, selbst
Experte zu werden, eigene Erfahrungen zu sammeln und die Welt auf individuelle
Weise zu verstehen und zu gestalten.What is CAROMELL?
The CAROMELL is a mobile,
floating platform that enables innovative, temporary living. We want to
reinterpret the classic houseboat typology. How can we build without property?
We want to conquer the space on the water. This platform also incorporate the
changes in society to flexible and mobile activities. We understand wanderlust
as a expression of a lifestyle. The following picture, shows a collage of our Caromell draft.Was ist CAROMELL?Die CAROMELL ist einen mobiler, schwimmender Körper, der innovativ vorübergehendes Bewohnen ermöglicht. Dabei möchten wir den klassischen
Hausboottypus neu interpretieren und kleiner realisieren. 
Wie kann man heute in Berlin ohne Baugrundstück bauen? (T)Raum auf dem Wasser ist die Lösung. Das Hausfloß greift das Bedürfnis der
modernen Gesellschaft nach Mobilität auf, soziale Aktivitäten sind oft räumlich
voneinander getrennt. Wir verbinden diese und gehen zusätzlich auf das
innerliche Begehren nach Ortsunabhängigkeit ein. Das Unterwegssein ist Ausdruck
eines Lebensstils. Das folgende Bild zeigt ein Collage unseres Caromell - Entwurfes.


Building
We want to build: to shape our
environment, to give a new life to 'old' material, not to plan exclusively in
front of a screen, to balance out exuberant consume and basic needs. Everybody who wants to build something too, is warmly invited to help us at the plot in Gosen.BauenWir wollen bauen: um unsere Umwelt selbst einzurichten und vermeintlich unbrauchbar
gewordene Materialien wieder aufbereiten und so neues Leben einhauchen, nicht
nur am Computer planen und den Spielraum zwischen verschwenderischem Konsum und
grundlegender Versorgung auszuloten. Jeder der mitbauen möchte, ist herzlich nach Gosen auf das Baugrundstück eingeladen, um zu helfen.


You can see, we already collected a lot of basic materials and already started to build. Wie du siehst, haben wir bereits viele Materialien sammeln können und mit dem Bau bereits angefangen.Back to nature!With this project we confront free-time in nature with a daily-life
living. The implementation of small holiday-houses on the water close to
residential areas could be an answer to the complex needs of society. This
could be the mock-up for a generation that wants to live everywhere for a time. Zurück zur Natur!
Mit dem Projekt untersuchen wir die Balance zwischen Freizeit in der Natur und
einer alltäglichen Wohnsituation. Die Eingliederung der Datsche auf dem Wasser in das Wohngebiet kann eine Antwort auf die differenzierten Bedürfnisse und auf die zunehmende
Komplexität des gesellschaftlichen Lebens sein. Das Hausfloß kann ein Modell für
eine Generation sein, die an jedem Ort der Welt für eine Zeit lang zu Hause
sein kann und möchte.


Recreation 
CAROMELL is a space to calm and relax with fresh air, a garden, a place of
creativity, conviviality and for travel. If you board it you step into freedom,
enjoyment and tranquillity - far away of working routine. It will be build in a
way that the private core is protected, but the outer opens up generously to
the surrounding.Erholung
Die CAROMELL ist ein Ort der Ruhe, Erholung, des Ausspannens und Abreagierens,
der frischen Luft, eines Gartens, von künstlerischer Kreativität, Geselligkeit,
sowie des Urlaubs- und Reiseersatz. Die Ankunft auf dem Hausfloß erscheint als der ersehnte Eintritt in die Welt
der Freiheit, des Genießerischem und der Gelassenheit, frei von den
Einschränkungen der Alltagsroutine. Das Innere des Bungalows bleibt oft abgeschottet , das Äußere hingegen öffnet
sich zur Außenwelt. 

Future
The water of Berlin could become
a niche for alternative culture and a space where all classes come together.
There is enough space that could connect future low-budget-captains and foster
the already existing strong scene.ZukunftDie Wasserwege in Berlin könnten eine stadtdurchziehende Nische für alternative
Kultur und ein Ort, an dem alle Schichten zusammenfinden, werden. Platz genug wäre
jedenfalls da und das ganz ohne (Bau)Grund, um uns „Low-Budget-Schiffer“ und die bereits existierende eng vernetzte Szene zu vereinen und zu stärken. 

Why do we need your money?
For finishing the CAROMELL and
passing the next summer with you on it, we need some construction parts that we
can't built with recycled materials. For example:
an engine
 constructional
connecting elements like screws, bolts and brackets 
varnishes and impregnations 
a solar battery 
an anchor
Wofür brauchen wir euer Geld?Um das Floß wirklich fahrtüchtig machen zu können und um gemeinsam die
zukünftigen Sommer mit euch darauf verbringen zu können, benötigt dieses eine
gewisse Ausstattung, welche wir leider nicht aus recycelten Materialien
aufbereiten können.

Dazu gehören unter anderem:
ein Motor

diverse Verbindungselemente wie Schrauben, Bolzen und Winkel
Bootslacke und Imprägnierungen
eine Solarbatterie
ein Anker


So help us, we are all in the same boat. You can see on our facebook-page, what we have done so far: https://www.facebook.com/caromellhausAlso helft uns, wir sitzen schließlich alle in einem Boot.Was wir bisher
geschafft haben erfahrt ihr auf unserer Facebookseite: https://www.facebook.com/caromellhaus

<p>There are many “automated” trading platforms out there already but they’re difficult to use and many require programming knowledge or deep knowledge of the stock market. They also typically do NOT automagically trade for you. You still have to buy and sell, meaning you still have to sit at your computer and watch boring graphs all day. This is where Abbey is different. </p>
<p><b>You set your parameters and walk away. Abbey will do the rest.</b></p>
<p>Not convinced yet? Here’s what Abbey can do. Say, for example, you’re not one of the 1% and don’t have a lot of money. $500 is all you need to start. Here’s what Abbey does:</p>
<p>If you invested $500 when Abbey made the trade below, just to stay conservative,  Abbey only invested 25% into this stock by purchasing 45 shares at 2.72 per share. She lets it ride until the sell signal is given at $5.89 per share. You’ve just gained 116%. Let’s put that in simple terms.</p>
<p>You start with $500 in your account.</p>
<p>Abbey used 25% ($122.40 to be exact) to purchase 45 shares.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the stock reaches $5.89 per share, signaling Abbey to sell the stock for $265.05. Out of the original $122.40 invested, you've gained $142.65, a total of 116% Return on Investment (ROI).<br/></p>
<p>You now have $765.05 in your account after 4 days.<br/></p>
<p>Pretty cool, eh? By compounding your earnings (leave it in the bank and let Abbey keep 
trading with the winnings), your income will grow exponentially.<br/></p>

My Pet Credentials™<span>  (MPC) started with a personal passion, a
commitment to the well being of our pets - and the realization that we could
maximize our pet industry experience to create more accessible, more effective
worldwide resources for managing our pets' health, their records and ensuring
their safety. And we could do it with the ease of an intuitive mobile app for
iOS and Android that connects people to pets and their information around the

pet<span>  services business in Houston,
Texas, that provides boarding, grooming, day care and dog training. </span></i></p>
<p><i>Over the years, we've
seen many clients who arrive at our business to find they don't have
updated<span>  proof of vaccinations or other
vital records, often required by law in many cities to board or even have a pet
groomed. It can be extremely frustrating to try and quickly obtain the
necessary documentation from a local veterinarian, and especially difficult if
you've recently relocated.</span></i></p>
<p><i>Beyond the
inconvenience, failure to have critical medical information can impact a pet's
well being, if allergies to medications or chronic health disorders cannot be
determined in an emergency situation. Lack of access can also affect a pet's
safe return home if they're lost or stolen and microchips or other identifying
tags are not current or properly registered.</i></p>

<p>Being separated from a pet
is devastating – so the MPC total program works even harder to ensure if a pet
is ever lost, the chances of a happy reunion are ideally improved:</p>
<p>- Uses a QR-coded,
proprietary MPC ID tag – unique to your pet and its profile. </p>
<p>- Anyone who finds the pet
can scan the tag and communicate directly via text,        phone or email<span>. </span></p>
<p>- Profile connectivity and
information-sharing with a network of shelters, rescues, municipal <span>agencies and similar organizations.</span></p>
<p>- Complements traditional
microchips and other databased identification devices and allows for<span> these
distinctive numbers to be linked to the pet's unique MPC code. </span></p>
<p>- Provides a significant
measure of safety and helps circumvent potential lapses  associated with <span>traditional identification measures if
information is not up-to-date or not registered.</span></p><p><span></span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DUYITgq_wGE0%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FUYITgq_wGE0&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

maximize our pet industry experience to create more accessible, more effective
worldwide resources for managing our pets' health, their records and ensuring
their safety. And we could do it with the ease of an intuitive mobile app for
iOS and Android that connects people to pets and their information around the
clock.
The
paw print behind the program.
My name is Jeff Davis
and along with my wife, Jill, and some close friends, we own a longtime
pet  services business in Houston,
Texas, that provides boarding, grooming, day care and dog training. 
Over the years, we've
seen many clients who arrive at our business to find they don't have
updated  proof of vaccinations or other
vital records, often required by law in many cities to board or even have a pet
groomed. It can be extremely frustrating to try and quickly obtain the
necessary documentation from a local veterinarian, and especially difficult if
you've recently relocated.
Beyond the
inconvenience, failure to have critical medical information can impact a pet's
well being, if allergies to medications or chronic health disorders cannot be
determined in an emergency situation. Lack of access can also affect a pet's
safe return home if they're lost or stolen and microchips or other identifying
tags are not current or properly registered.
We knew there had to
be a solution that combined all the elements of pet management, all the time.
                                                     Altogether
simpler, always within reach, in iOS or Android.
Patterned after patient
Electronic Medical Records, the MPC app for iOS and Android features a
sophisticated but easy-to-use digital mobile interface that starts with
creating a profile, then gathers, organizes, stores and makes available, 24
hours a day, all of a pet's information including:
- Veterinary resource(s)
- Vaccination and other
records
- Health histories
- Dietary requirements
- Medications
- Special needs
- Grooming preferences
- Emergency and other
contact numbers
- Unique identifiers
(microchip/license registration numbers)
- Multiple pet profiles


Practical,
proactive connectivity.
Ever miss an appointment
or vaccination reminder? My Pet Credentials makes managing every pet’s life a
much simpler process, with an intuitive design that allows you to quickly
create or update each pet’s profile. 
                          
Once this profile is in
place, your life as a pet owner is easier. The patented MPC platform does all
the work, with:
- Profile and
records-sharing between designated pet medical care or services providers such
as
  your veterinarian, groomer, boarding and day
care facility.
- Access to all information
no matter where you are.
- Appointment request and
confirmation options.
- Syncing all appointments,
alerts and reminders with your smartphone and/or email calendar app.
- Full functionality from
your smartphone device as well as desktop/laptop or tablet.          
The
heart behind the hardware for advanced lost pet recovery.   

Being separated from a pet
is devastating – so the MPC total program works even harder to ensure if a pet
is ever lost, the chances of a happy reunion are ideally improved:
- Uses a QR-coded,
proprietary MPC ID tag – unique to your pet and its profile. 
- Anyone who finds the pet
can scan the tag and communicate directly via text,        phone or email. 
- Profile connectivity and
information-sharing with a network of shelters, rescues, municipal agencies and similar organizations.
- Complements traditional
microchips and other databased identification devices and allows for these
distinctive numbers to be linked to the pet's unique MPC code. 
- Provides a significant
measure of safety and helps circumvent potential lapses  associated with traditional identification measures if
information is not up-to-date or not registered.
Be part of the solution to total pet management. 
We are seeking supporters
with vested interest in the health and safety of their own pets and an
appreciation of the benefits available to multiple providers and pet partners
everywhere. In 2016, the pet products industry anticipates over $60 billion
will be spent by U.S. households on pet-related products and services.*
Informed and devoted, yet challenged by lifestyle demands, pet owners are likely
to continue seeking uniqueness, quality, convenience and accessibility as
defining characteristics for their pet-related product choices. And that's
exactly what MPC can offer with completion of our multi-version app.
Your contributions will:
- Take us over the finish
line for full program development.
- Help bring MPC to market.
- Introduce beta testing
with a release date of April 1, 2016 and public release on  May 1, 2016
- Develop Version 2 for
veterinarians and pet adoption agency functionality. 
- Design a program to
collaborate with and assist nonprofit pet partners as well as pet adoption efforts.

</li>
</ul><p>* <i>Patent pending or granted covering 51 countries.</i></p>
<p>Currently, alerts
are only available for limited smart phone types in very few areas. Our SAM solution
allows messages to be received instantly by ALL cell phone users in a country and will save
large numbers of people from death, injury and trauma globally.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472686219/20110511mobile-phone-alerts_uapptj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our cell

mobile phones in times of disaster, can relay information from  
Disaster Centres instantly to all cell phones in targeted areas, simultaneously  before,
during and in the aftermath of all types of disasters. </p><p>Follow up messages can be delivered within seconds. Our plan is to make it
available on all cell phones, worldwide, at no cost to users.</p>
<p>SAM is an
instant mass messaging system targeting any number of cell phones at the same time, and works seamlessly; it is independent of SMS, voice and data networks, which
can crash or become unusable when they are overloaded. </p><p>Users can opt out of receiving most alert types other than life threatening alert messages. The solution was tested thoroughly on a large public land mobile network (PLMN) and passed all tests with flying colours.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472687773/Cell_Broadcast_dotyfw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The PLMN technology that we utilise is the recommended method of sending alert messages to the public. The
European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as well as FEMA recommends this method as the best available. See EU-ALERT ETSI TD 102 900v010101p. SAM also complies with all
     international requirements for location based alert systems i.e. CAP v1.2, ETSI, OASIS, WARN act etc.

<div></div><h3>

Why?</h3><div>
</div><h3>
</h3><div>
</div><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is a
clear and present need for an instant, secure, reliable and targetable public
alert system that will reach the most people in the shortest possible time, and
continue to supply them with information in times of distress and need. </p>
<p>To be
forewarned is to be forearmed. </p>
<p>Current
systems discriminate towards users in various ways, preventing messages from
reaching all cell phone users. </p><p>SAM provides the best, most ideal
solution and ticks all the boxes. Other systems already out there fail the test
and do not tick all the boxes. This leads to a false sense of security and 
gets people killed or injured when disaster strikes.</p>
<p>Everyone
should have access to life saving alerts and warnings. </p><p>It is a basic human
right and should not be for some smart phone users in some countries only. </p><p>The quickest and best
way to contact the most people instantly is via cell phones with our SAM
solution. This will save lives, prevent injuries and avoid the terrible trauma
of losing loved ones.</p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471395565/crisis_ahead_SAM_iq1b6g.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><h3>How?</h3><div>
</div><div>
<b></b>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>SAM can deliver government
authorised instant, targeted, secure alerts without needing mobile numbers or
recording any personal details of users. <span>When
implemented, all mobile handsets, old or new (and not only smart phones)
will display alert messages signalled by an intrusive unique alarm, vibration
(if possible) and flashing lights. </span></p><p><span>Automatic roaming takes care of country specific settings and allows international travellers to be
informed in the language of their choice for all countries utilising the solution.</span></p><div>

Our
mobile Multimedia Distribution Platform (M<sup>2</sup>DP) software will be used
to distribute SAM over the air to all cell phones, including future software updates. </div><div>The focus
will be on user friendly automation with minimal user disruption whilst respecting user privacy. The M<sup>2</sup>DP
software has been used successfully on 2.5G and 3G mobile networks in Australia,
Canada, Germany, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, UK and the USA and is compatible with
all handsets and operating systems.</div><div><br/></div><h3>What do we want to do?</h3><p></p>
<p>SAM is a
low cost location-based solution, which we need to finalise and implement globally
as quickly as possible in order to reduce further unnecessary death, injury and
trauma. </p><p>SAM will operate on all handset types including older non-smart phones.</p><div>

SAM is the most ideal and has many different life saving functions and uses, for example instant
secure group messages for police, military, fire &amp; rescue, all educational institutions and more. </div><div>Critical alerts and information in the case of an active shooter. We also plan to include a user request for assistance module where users can request emergency services to come to their location.<br/>
</div><p></p><div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465444650/SEEM_AS_System_for_Indiegogo_201511_gkw1jk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div><i>Diagram showing the flow of emergency information with SAM</i></div><div>
<i></i><br/>
</div><h3>We Need</h3><div> </div><p></p>
<p>Funding to complete the
development and integration of our handset module with our mobile multimedia distribution platform (M<sup>2</sup>DP). </p><p>$22 Million has already been spent on the M<sup>2</sup>DP to complete and implement it successfully. </p><p>We have already spent
$2 million on SAM and require an additional $5 million to complete and
implement the solution. </p><p><b>We need $1.5 million, which we are trying to raise via this crowdfunding effort</b> to allow us to generate the rest of the funding required, which will be a co-investment from government based on the amount we now raise, and tax rebates for research and development spend. </p><p>With sufficient funding we can be operational within 6
months. We are very cost conscious and utilise strict corporate governance. </p>
<p>Your help is urgently needed to
allow us to complete the solution.</p><div>

Every
$ will help get us there. We have already made great progress bootstrapping
towards reaching our goals, and we have received a request for our first
government contract. </div><div>However, the software is not your regular mobile
app. It is much more in depth, requiring special skills and of
course costs a lot more than a regular mobile app to complete, integrate
and implement. SAM is also dependant on supporting hardware.</div><p></p><div>
</div><p><b>Funds will be utilised as follows:</b></p><div> </div><ul> <li>Let us qualify for government co-investment</li>
<li>Business Development                                                                         $ 300k<br/>
</li>
<li>Software development completion and integration                   $ 900k</li> <li>Equipment (integration hardware and software)                        $ 300k</li>
</ul><div><br/></div><ul>
</ul> <div> </div><h3></h3><div>
</div><p></p><h3>The Impact of SAM</h3><div>Instant warnings about many dangers like terrorist attacks, active shooters, natural disasters and more will certainly contribute to a better quality of life on a global basis.  </div><div>SAM could alert you, your loved ones and friends, allowing time to get out of harm's way. </div><div>You will be surprised at how few countries use AMBER Alerts and most of those are sent via FM radio or TV. </div><div><b>Impact:</b></div><ul>
<li>Quick, targeted AMBER Alerts can <b>save the lives of countless children</b> and help avoid lifelong trauma to kids in danger and their loved ones. A quick, targeted AMBER alert that results in finding a lost or kidnapped child <b>brings immeasurable happiness and relief</b>. There are no words that can adequately highlight the extreme importance and urgency of SAM.</li>
<li>Quick, targeted alerts can provide relief on a global scale. Recent <b>attacks on innocent people in Europe</b> highlights the need for quick alerts.</li>
<li>Quick, targeted alerts result in<b> less pressure on emergency services</b> and first responders by getting people out of harm's way. This will materially reduce financial impacts on governments, countries and aid organisations.</li>
<li>Quick <b>automated earthquake alerts</b>. Warning can be given precious seconds ahead of a quake (80 seconds advance warning previously for Tokio), depending on the distance from the epicentre.</li>
<li>
<b>Improved quality of life for all</b> under the SAM umbrella, supported by our multimedia distribution platform that can provide a myriad of additional information.<br/>

Continuous updates during and after disasters and tragedies will reduce stress and contribute greatly to quality of life.</div><blockquote>
<p>“The most important thing in dealing with any crisis is communication.” J.W. Marriott Jr, CEO Marriott International</p>
<p><br/></p>
</blockquote><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p> There are always risks and challenges. Some of ours are:</p><ul>
<li>Not getting SAM implemented quickly enough, allowing governments to take on inferior and dangerous solutions like SMS or alert systems for limited smart phones only.</li>
<li>Completing the SAM software, integrating it with our mobile multimedia distribution platform and implementing our solution with Telcos is a challenge but we are highly capable and will do this successfully and efficiently.</li>
</ul><p>Our additional team members are highly skilled and qualified with many years of experience. Others are ready to join us as soon as we have sufficient funds available. </p><p>We have many high level contacts in all the right places in various countries who are very interested and willing to take on our SAM solution. Some countries have told us that they desperately need our solution but have no budget for it. We propose to implement it free of charge. We have already planned everything in detail with a highly skilled and experienced project management team.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>In order to say thank you...</h3><div>
</div><div>We are developing a free service and that cannot be offered as a funding incentive as it will be free. There are however various items that everyone should have in order to help them during times of disaster or displacement. We have top class, high quality, critical items that you can keep in your car or go-bag, as a thank you for your valuable contribution to make the world a better and safer place for all. </div><div>In addition we'll make our demo software available in two of the perks if we manage to get sufficient funding to complete the demo software. This includes free updates and is basically a fully functional SMS app that will demonstrate the solution and includes cool secret messaging capabilities. The final solution does not utilise SMS.</div><div>Every perk includes a certificate for contributing to saving lives at the first major disaster event where SAM is operational.</div><div>The items below provide more details on the incentives we offer.</div><h3><br/></h3><h3>15w Solar Charger - received rave reviews</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449142653/eaw73al7qcj996wuodf6.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 598.66px;height: 449px;""/></p><p></p><ul>

</div></div>","Quick SummaryThe world’s ultimate and extremely user-friendly alert solution enabling all users to instantly receive Disaster
Warning Information on all types of cell (mobile) phones. In
an emergency situation people are starved of information, even though the majority carry cell phones. It is the most personal, highly relevant communications
device in the history of mankind.
""Nothing in life is more
important than the ability to communicate effectively."" -- Gerald R. Ford, 38th President of the United States 


It can
happen at any time. It happened to many others in the past. Tragic photos in
the headlines. 
Disaster
strikes and loved ones are injured or gone forever.
Billions
of dollars are poured into disaster relief and very little goes to disaster
prevention. Why?
Because humanity is reactive rather than pro-active.

You can
help us make a global difference by preventing death and terrible trauma. Have
you really made your mark in the world up to now? Secure Alert Messaging offers you the
opportunity to help us make a meaningful difference in the world for many years
to come.
About
16,000 people died in the 2011 Japan tsunami

Some
of the lucky few but they did not benefit from SAM, the Life Saving Solution.


Every year
thousands die, and many more are injured in natural disasters and emergencies
due to timely alerts and information not being made available to
people in potential disaster locations.
Only a select few people in the world
can receive Disaster Warning Information in a timely manner, as there is
currently no adequate solution for relaying the information from 
Disaster Centres to the populace. We have the ideal solution and need your help to complete and start implementing it. Governments from various countries have already requested us to get back to them with our completed solution as soon as possible. Video: People complaining about no alerts or flood warnings
It is
unbelievable that we live in a so-called modern day and age of technology
but instant life saving alerts and warnings are not available
to most people on earth. We aspire to achieve this.
Australian
based EDWARDS Information Broadcast (EIB)
has a socially responsible mission to provide a quick and easy method of
relaying Emergency Warning information from National/State Disaster Centres to ALL cell (mobile) phone users in a country/state.
EDWARDS: Emergency Disaster Warning Alert Relaying Delivery Solutions


Overview 

We have a patented* solution - SAM                                                                         SAM = Secure Alert Messaging 
SAM can deliver timely alerts and quick updates to ALL enabled cell phones;
SAM can be sent to specific target areas only or a whole country;
SAM is almost ready to implement; we need help with the last bit of funding;

SAMs Multimedia Distribution Platform allows individual users to request specific information, even from an old
legacy or non-smart phone. Many millions of people around the
globe could benefit from educational content and other additional
information that we can provide.

* Patent pending or granted covering 51 countries.
Currently, alerts
are only available for limited smart phone types in very few areas. Our SAM solution
allows messages to be received instantly by ALL cell phone users in a country and will save
large numbers of people from death, injury and trauma globally.
Our cell
phone solution, aimed at providing Location-Based Instant Alert Messages to all
mobile phones in times of disaster, can relay information from  
Disaster Centres instantly to all cell phones in targeted areas, simultaneously  before,
during and in the aftermath of all types of disasters. Follow up messages can be delivered within seconds. Our plan is to make it
available on all cell phones, worldwide, at no cost to users.
SAM is an
instant mass messaging system targeting any number of cell phones at the same time, and works seamlessly; it is independent of SMS, voice and data networks, which
can crash or become unusable when they are overloaded. Users can opt out of receiving most alert types other than life threatening alert messages. The solution was tested thoroughly on a large public land mobile network (PLMN) and passed all tests with flying colours.The PLMN technology that we utilise is the recommended method of sending alert messages to the public. The
European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) as well as FEMA recommends this method as the best available. See EU-ALERT ETSI TD 102 900v010101p. SAM also complies with all
     international requirements for location based alert systems i.e. CAP v1.2, ETSI, OASIS, WARN act etc.

Highly skilled team members are ready to go ahead as soon as we are funded. Neil Wienand is the founder and he is supported by David Mathie, former
chief industrial architect of the European Space Agency. More information on the founders can be viewed here: Our Board
By helping to
complete our solution you will contribute to preventing death, injury and trauma on a
global scale. 
Please help
fund our efforts. Your contribution may very well make the difference in getting you and your loved ones out of harm’s way sometime in the near
future in any country.


Why?




There is a
clear and present need for an instant, secure, reliable and targetable public
alert system that will reach the most people in the shortest possible time, and
continue to supply them with information in times of distress and need. 
To be
forewarned is to be forearmed. 
Current
systems discriminate towards users in various ways, preventing messages from
reaching all cell phone users. SAM provides the best, most ideal
solution and ticks all the boxes. Other systems already out there fail the test
and do not tick all the boxes. This leads to a false sense of security and 
gets people killed or injured when disaster strikes.
Everyone
should have access to life saving alerts and warnings. It is a basic human
right and should not be for some smart phone users in some countries only. The quickest and best
way to contact the most people instantly is via cell phones with our SAM
solution. This will save lives, prevent injuries and avoid the terrible trauma
of losing loved ones.





How?




SAM can deliver government
authorised instant, targeted, secure alerts without needing mobile numbers or
recording any personal details of users. When
implemented, all mobile handsets, old or new (and not only smart phones)
will display alert messages signalled by an intrusive unique alarm, vibration
(if possible) and flashing lights. Automatic roaming takes care of country specific settings and allows international travellers to be
informed in the language of their choice for all countries utilising the solution.

Our
mobile Multimedia Distribution Platform (M2DP) software will be used
to distribute SAM over the air to all cell phones, including future software updates. The focus
will be on user friendly automation with minimal user disruption whilst respecting user privacy. The M2DP
software has been used successfully on 2.5G and 3G mobile networks in Australia,
Canada, Germany, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, UK and the USA and is compatible with
all handsets and operating systems.What do we want to do?
SAM is a
low cost location-based solution, which we need to finalise and implement globally
as quickly as possible in order to reduce further unnecessary death, injury and
trauma. SAM will operate on all handset types including older non-smart phones.

SAM is the most ideal and has many different life saving functions and uses, for example instant
secure group messages for police, military, fire & rescue, all educational institutions and more. Critical alerts and information in the case of an active shooter. We also plan to include a user request for assistance module where users can request emergency services to come to their location.

We Need 
Funding to complete the
development and integration of our handset module with our mobile multimedia distribution platform (M2DP). $22 Million has already been spent on the M2DP to complete and implement it successfully. We have already spent
$2 million on SAM and require an additional $5 million to complete and
implement the solution. We need $1.5 million, which we are trying to raise via this crowdfunding effort to allow us to generate the rest of the funding required, which will be a co-investment from government based on the amount we now raise, and tax rebates for research and development spend. With sufficient funding we can be operational within 6
months. We are very cost conscious and utilise strict corporate governance. 
Your help is urgently needed to
allow us to complete the solution.

Every
$ will help get us there. We have already made great progress bootstrapping
towards reaching our goals, and we have received a request for our first
government contract. However, the software is not your regular mobile
app. It is much more in depth, requiring special skills and of
course costs a lot more than a regular mobile app to complete, integrate
and implement. SAM is also dependant on supporting hardware.
Funds will be utilised as follows:  Let us qualify for government co-investment
Business Development                                                                         $ 300k

Software development completion and integration                   $ 900k Equipment (integration hardware and software)                        $ 300k

  
The Impact of SAMInstant warnings about many dangers like terrorist attacks, active shooters, natural disasters and more will certainly contribute to a better quality of life on a global basis.  SAM could alert you, your loved ones and friends, allowing time to get out of harm's way. You will be surprised at how few countries use AMBER Alerts and most of those are sent via FM radio or TV. Impact:
Quick, targeted AMBER Alerts can save the lives of countless children and help avoid lifelong trauma to kids in danger and their loved ones. A quick, targeted AMBER alert that results in finding a lost or kidnapped child brings immeasurable happiness and relief. There are no words that can adequately highlight the extreme importance and urgency of SAM.
Quick, targeted alerts can provide relief on a global scale. Recent attacks on innocent people in Europe highlights the need for quick alerts.
Quick, targeted alerts result in less pressure on emergency services and first responders by getting people out of harm's way. This will materially reduce financial impacts on governments, countries and aid organisations.
Quick automated earthquake alerts. Warning can be given precious seconds ahead of a quake (80 seconds advance warning previously for Tokio), depending on the distance from the epicentre.

Improved quality of life for all under the SAM umbrella, supported by our multimedia distribution platform that can provide a myriad of additional information.

Getting people out of danger quickly will save many lives. Continuous updates during and after disasters and tragedies will reduce stress and contribute greatly to quality of life.
“The most important thing in dealing with any crisis is communication.” J.W. Marriott Jr, CEO Marriott International

Risks & Challenges There are always risks and challenges. Some of ours are:
Not getting SAM implemented quickly enough, allowing governments to take on inferior and dangerous solutions like SMS or alert systems for limited smart phones only.
Completing the SAM software, integrating it with our mobile multimedia distribution platform and implementing our solution with Telcos is a challenge but we are highly capable and will do this successfully and efficiently.
Our additional team members are highly skilled and qualified with many years of experience. Others are ready to join us as soon as we have sufficient funds available. We have many high level contacts in all the right places in various countries who are very interested and willing to take on our SAM solution. Some countries have told us that they desperately need our solution but have no budget for it. We propose to implement it free of charge. We have already planned everything in detail with a highly skilled and experienced project management team.
In order to say thank you...
We are developing a free service and that cannot be offered as a funding incentive as it will be free. There are however various items that everyone should have in order to help them during times of disaster or displacement. We have top class, high quality, critical items that you can keep in your car or go-bag, as a thank you for your valuable contribution to make the world a better and safer place for all. In addition we'll make our demo software available in two of the perks if we manage to get sufficient funding to complete the demo software. This includes free updates and is basically a fully functional SMS app that will demonstrate the solution and includes cool secret messaging capabilities. The final solution does not utilise SMS.Every perk includes a certificate for contributing to saving lives at the first major disaster event where SAM is operational.The items below provide more details on the incentives we offer.15w Solar Charger - received rave reviews
