<h3>Hello, my name is Alanna Phillips and I am currently a company member at LaShelle's School of Dance in Detroit, Michigan. I have been dancing for 8 years and I am now 16 years old. I participate in ballet, tap, pointe, jazz, modern and hip hop. At the studio, I am also a junior staff member. Besides dancing at the studio I am an uprising junior at Renaissance High School and I maintain a 3.5 grade point average. I also am a member of the dance workshop at school. This year I won 3 first place trophies for my tap solo on the regional level and placed 2nd at Nationals in Orlando, FL. I am very dedicated to dance and serious about having a career as a professional dancer someday!<br/><br/>As many of you know, last summer I was on a mission to get to a special dance program in Buffalo New York and I made it thanks to your support and generosity!   This year I'm on a mission to New York again, but I can only do it with your help...</h3>
<h3>I just found out about a program I would LOVE to participate in. This up coming August, I am hoping to attend a summer dance intensive in NYC but having just returned from nationals in Orlando, I don't quite have enough funds for the trip. Broadway Dance Centre will be hosting a 4 day long Intensive where I will be taking 7 classes a day in different genres of dance from New York's top choreographers. I will also have the opportunity  to meet  with agents and take classes with dancers from all over the country. My family can cover travel and lodging but it is getting down to the deadline and I still need help with the registration fees.  I really want to go so I'm trying to do whatever I can to make it happen.</h3>
<h3>By participating in this summer program, I believe it will help me diversify and improve my dancing. Anytime I take classes from different teachers, I realize that I am adding a new style to my dance knowledge and increasing my skills. Only with the help of your donations will I be able to achieve the goal of becoming a better dancer by attending this Intensive Program. I appreciate anything you can give!</h3>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
Theatrum Elysium offers the Southern California community a unique alternative to the typical L.A. theater experience. A wholehearted celebration of empowered artistic innovation - from every background and medium, Theatrum Elysium strives to reawaken the creative spirit in each of us. <br/><br/>True to its name, Theatrum Elysium is an artistic paradise - a caring, dedicated community fully invested in the work of every inspired craftsman. We joyfully embrace the interdisciplinary nature of performance, utilizing every aspect of human experience to delve further and further into the unknown. Through intelligent and fearless exploration, Theatrum Elysium is committed to reexamining the fundamental works that have defined performance from Ancient Greece to Modern America. We knowingly stand on the shoulders of giants, casting our vision forward into a new era of American performance.<br/><br/>We at Theatrum Elysium are committed to fueling the next generation of American art, creating visionary work that rattles the foundations of modern performance.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Production</h3>
<p>Theatrum Elysium invites audiences to join us this summer as we celebrate <strong>the inauguration of our new outdoor stage</strong> with a bold and exhilarating production of William  Shakespeare’s oft-forgotten epic, <em>Cymbeline</em>.  Vibrantly brought to life by Artistic Director Aaron Ganz, <em>Cymbeline</em> takes audiences through a spirited adventure teeming with the Bard’s familiar themes of forbidden romances, betrayed relationships, and the mayhem of war, and reinvigorates them with a dynamic and refreshing theatrical vision.</p>
<p>One of Shakespeare’s final works, <em>Cymbeline</em> follows the tale of Cymbeline, the King of Britain and his only daughter, the beautiful Imogen.  Under the sway of the ambitious new Queen, Cymbeline promises her son Cloten not only Imogen as his wife, but a greater seat of power.  Upon discovering that Imogen has secretly married a commoner for love rather than politics, the royal family is spurred into a rage and Cymbeline banishes her lover.  With the kingdom knocked into chaos by scandal and a looming political threat fromRome, Imogen escapes from her father’s court and embarks on a journey to reunite with her love—however, she is far from being free from danger.  Imogen’s path thrusts her into a fantastical world of alchemy, disguises, and treachery, which she must overcome in order to find not only her husband, but the hidden strength within herself.</p>
<p>Theatrum Elysium’s <em>Cymbeline</em> offers theatre-goers a production that does not simply “take place outdoors”—but rather a rare opportunity to be transported into the vivid, but often dangerous, world of Shakespeare’s imagination.  <strong>Infused with expressive choreography, riveting music, explosive battle scenes, and a narrator to guide audiences through the flurry of adventures</strong>, this theatrical experience rediscovers the magic and mystery of mistaken identity, star-crossed lovers, and the dreams that define us all.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a homeschooling parent in Chicago.  My daughter loves Marie Curie.  We found a program coming to town called Manya - A Living History of Marie Curie.  It will be performed at a Northwestern University conference on infrared optoelectronic materials and devices.  I visited the Manya website and was excited by the description.  It sounded perfect for theatrical and sciency students.  Unfortunately, admission was restricted to university students and conference attendees.  I had a few conversations with the artist in Colorado to see if we could arrange another showing.  It required negotiation with NU and a host of others, but we rolled through it.  The artist is so generous and committed to sharing Marie Curie's life that she has given us a really reduced rate.  Northwestern is also generous enough to allow us to ""borrow"" their artist on the plane ticket for which they paid.</p>
<p>By donating to this, you will be making this show available to school children and adults throughout the Chicago area.  Obviously, Northwestern thought it was a great enough show to be the closing act of their intense multi-day conference.  Our kids deserve to see it too.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The artist has been quite generous by charging the parent community a fraction of what she charges large organizations.  Still, we can't have the fee fall on a few on one family.  We need to raise enough to cover her fee, which she asks to not make public because it was a unique negotiation, and the fee indiegogo takes here.  </p>
<p>Admission will be open to the public free of charge otherwise.  Please make a donation to support the artist.</p>
</div>
<div>

What We Need
The artist has been quite generous by charging the parent community a fraction of what she charges large organizations.  Still, we can't have the fee fall on a few on one family.  We need to raise enough to cover her fee, which she asks to not make public because it was a unique negotiation, and the fee indiegogo takes here.

The Impact
Marie Curie has been an inspiration to young scientists for decades.  The program description from the Storysmith site explains exactly why your child and you might want to donate and attend.
Likely the most famous woman scientist, Madame Marie Curie (née Maria Skłodowska) — changed the world in which we live through her discovery of radium and radioactivity. Through collaboration with the medical community the Curies discovered and established the first successful radiation treatments of cancer. Simply through her own passion and perseverance, Marie Curie opened the doors of science to women world wide.
This program honors a preeminent woman of science : Madame Curie was the first European woman to earn a doctorate in the sciences; the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize (for the discovery of radioactivity); the first woman to teach at the Sorbonne; and the first person to receive a second Nobel Prize (a feat not to be repeated for another 50 years). Audiences witness the origins of scientific discoveries we now take for granted. They re-live the remarkable collaboration between husband and wife, Pierre and Marie, companion scientists.
This program honors the ethic of scientific altruism. Einstein said Marie Curie was ""the only person to be uncorrupted by fame."" In today's age of patents and litigation, the audience learns that the Curies declined to patent their methods, refused to bend their discoveries toward personal financial gain. Marie insisted that to profit from the discovery of radium would be ""contrary to the scientific spirit.""
This program honors the wife and mother, who felt more daunted by the chemistry of the kitchen than of the laboratory. As a single mother, Marie raised her two daughters from ages 16 months and 8 years, after the tragic death of her husband, Pierre. And it honors Manya's Polish heritage — much neglected not only now, but in her own life, to her own dismay. This program brings to light many of Marie's lesser-known contributions, both social and scientific — and the obstacles she faced along the way.
Marie Curie was, in turn, nervous and shy in public, obsessive about measurement, in denial of the dangers of working with radioactive materials, proud and possessive of her discoveries, yet generous to the extreme with the products of her work.

She died before the new understanding of the atom — initiated by her discoveries — produced the atomic bomb.

The Breakdown









Made Up Theatre is a new, award winning improv and sketch comedy theatre that was established by five actors who wanted to share their love for the art with the Bay Area. Our theatre provides the community with fun and affordable entertainment, as well as offers education that inspires creativity and teaches the power of play.





Our venue, 3392 Seldon Court in Fremont is an intimate space that seats 49 people. We've opened the doors to the public, but there is still a lot to be done.  We've teamed up with Indie-GoGo and created some great incentives to help raise the funding necessary in order to give people an unforgettable experience.  With your help, we will be able to not only give friends, families, dates, and strangers a place to laugh and have fun, but we will also be able to bring laughter to thousands of people at local business, churches, and organizations with portable shows and team building events.






All money raised will go toward making the theatre functional and portable, covering operating expenses and equipment.  We are hoping to purchase: a 
sound system, wireless microphones, speakers, a mixer, cables, lighting equipment, video projection, and air-conditioning. 

We've created some great perks for your contributions, check them out, and thank you so much for your support!
Sincerely,






The cast and crew of Made Up Theatre: Bobby August, Ben Stephens, Dustin Seidler, and Sean Taylor

It has added a new dimension and way to reach an audience by combining the skaters’ unique artistry within the context of a multifaceted story such as <strong>“Viva La Vida; The Life of Frida Kahlo”</strong> or <strong>“Persephone and the Birth of Winter”.</strong> The key for each story is finding the balance between the narrative, dance, music and puppetry, each of which provides the audience with a new way to appreciate old tales and insights, for a new age.</p>

It has added a new dimension and way to reach an audience by combining the skaters’ unique artistry within the context of a multifaceted story such as “Viva La Vida; The Life of Frida Kahlo” or “Persephone and the Birth of Winter”. The key for each story is finding the balance between the narrative, dance, music and puppetry, each of which provides the audience with a new way to appreciate old tales and insights, for a new age.

<p><b>Event:</b> World Parks Congress (WPC) November 12th - 19th 2014</p>
<p><b>Our venues &amp; dates: </b>Sydney Olympic Park Saturday 15th 9:30 -10am + Parramatta Riverside Theatres, Lennox Theatre, Monday 17th 7:30-8:30pm<br/></p>
<p><b>Collaborating presenters:<i> </i></b>choreographer Dean Walsh &amp; ecologist Dr Judy Fisher</p>
<p></p>
<h4>
<b>Who is that masked man?</b>
</h4>
<p>Dean Walsh, Sydney based choreographer, facilitator and dance/marine environment researcher and Australia Council Fellow 2011-2012, has 23 years professional experience. His proposal to World Parks Congress was accepted to present INTRUSIONS, a 30 minute dance and discussion segment reflecting on the theme of 'invasive species'.<br/></p>
<p>Inspired by marine science and conservation for many years Dean began scuba diving in 2008. This activity immediately inspired a major shift in his former thematic interests. He moved from topics of a personal or human social nature towards also reflecting environmental themes, in particular, marine ecology and biodiversity. To carry out his investigations he scuba dives, free dives (without breathing apparatus), attends symposiums, talks and conferences and interviews marine
 scientists and professional environmentalists. <br/></p>
<p>He spends many hours
 in studios at various institutions physically researching how this information might be embodied and choreographically composed. In 2011 he undertook a two year Australia Council Fellowship. In this period he formed
 a new movement 'filing' system (akin to a type of user manual or 
taxonomy), called <i>PrimeOrderly</i>. His choreographic process for new dance works are streamed through this system.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>
<b>What is World Parks (WPC) congress?:</b>
</h4>
<p>WPC is one of the world's most important environmental events. It runs for an entire week and is commissioned by the IUCN (International Union for the Conservation of 
Nature). It brings together more than 166 countries - 
general public, environmental policy makers, scientists 
and conservation organisations, to engage in critical discussion within a multinational and multicultural context. It happens only once each decade in a different host city. It is 
estimated that nearly 5,000 people will attend the event in 2014 in Sydney.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>The presentations:</b></h4>
<p>As a work-in-progress (towards a 60 minute feature length work in 2015) INTRUSIONS at WPC will take the form of a dance-based lecture demonstration in 4 sections - taking inspiration from the format of a David Attenborough nature documentary. Eight highly skilled young dancers will embody a series of complex movement modulations, inspired 
by Dean's research into marine environment and ecology, in 4 tightly structured improvisations each reflecting a specific take on invasive species or the act of being invasive (human social / psychological metaphors) and the potential impacts.</p>
<p> Between these sections, to give context and insight into his research of depicting these realms, Dean will 'narrate' the entire presentation a little like a TED talk. Ecologist, Judy Fisher will also say a few words. She will reveal her research and its context 
within the presentation, discussing the arts and their position in environmental 
conversations, in particular, how dance can add a visceral communication
of scientific findings and conservation matters in engaging ways. <br/></p>INTRUSIONS will have two presentations:  one in the Marine Pavilion at WPC, Sydney Olympic Park site and the 2nd will be held at Parramatta Riverside 
Theatres (dates above). The Parramatta presentation will include 
basic theatrical atmospheres, a brief 2 minute sharing of motion capture-based digital animations that will later be added to the work. A panel of arts / science and conservation 
professionals will then discuss the themes in relation to their work and interests in the arts and science interface. Finally, a Q&amp;A will be held to engage the invited audience of WPC delegates, local arts and environmental professionals, as well as arts and environmental students. <br/><br/><h3>$4,000 - in only 4 weeks! </h3>
<p>As soon as we discovered we were successful in our application 
to WPC Dean Walsh embarked upon a fund raising campaign. He applied to 
various local and state councils as well as a few other institutions he 
thought may be able to assist. Whilst they found it a very interesting 
project, most have gotten back with news they cannot support us. This 
crowd funding campaign is now our only means of at least securing some 
funds for these incredible dancers who will have worked in excess of 80 
hours each to make this presentation the best it can be. 

</p>
<h4><b>Budget breakdown for what this campaign seeks assistance with:</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>6 x 400 = 2,400 - graduating student performance fees</li>
<li>2 x $1,200 - 2 paid professional dancers </li>
</ul>
<p>$4,800 - total all performers fees
Please help us reach our goal or even exceed it! The money will most 
definitely go towards overhead expenses. If you cannot donate perhaps 
you could help us by distributing our campaign through your networks? 
We'd greatly appreciate it. </p>
<h4><b>Choreographic impact:</b></h4>
<p>The potential for networking, audience 
development and possible future financial support through presenting at WPC is high. It will also help develop the work and ongoing support for it as well as Dean's overall research and growing dance/environment practice. There is 
potential for international touring of 
INTRUSIONS at off-shoot future conferences and symposiums.

<b>Justified and ancient:</b> <br/>
</h4>
<p>Dance has universal resonance as a language that has communicated human (and animal / environmental) stories for millennia. It is a culturally diverse and geographically specific form of expression that helps to reconnect us to play, pleasure and persuasion where perhaps words, or complex scientific facts on their own, cannot. Dance also reconnects us to a sense of belonging - to community and nature - as opposed to existing in isolation or separate from them. INTRUSIONS will convey, through intricate choreographic compositions, how species (including humans in this instance) invade or pillage ecosystems or perhaps, choreographically speaking, one another's physical or personal environments and the negative effects these can have. Discussions will reveal ways we might be able to arrest these negative impacts.<br/></p>

Performing and teaching are my passion - help me combine those and bring it home to you!My Goal: In order to make it to Con, I'll need $1200:$206 Early Registration$450 Flight $390 Hotel for three nights$175 Supplies and shipping for perks!(=$1221 Approximate fees included)If I surpass my goal, the remainder goes towards workshop supplies for my students, including gloves, boas, fans, costume supplies and any other treats I can think of for attendees!If I don't reach my goal, I get nothing, however I've already started paying for registration, so I'm headed to Seattle no matter what - your help would facilitate that goal and help me bring that education to YOU and audiences far and wide (okay, mostly to Acadiana)!The Perks!As a costume and jewelry designer for over a decade, I would LOVE to bring my creations and education to you. I've spent years performing, creating and teaching various creative workshops - this trip and the time following will be the ultimate extension of my passions.Check out the list of perks on the right and decide which is best suited for you - be that a burlesque postcard, one or more of my creations - including pasties and glamorous fascinators - or the ultimate - a private class with ME and your best friends! Perks are transferrable and make great gifts, otherwise, should you live out of town/state or are not interested in a workshop, you can cash in on pasties and fascinators or any other mail-able perk.Other Ways You Can Help:Can't contribute?  I'd love your help anyway! 
Share this page with your friends...use all those fun social media tools to get the word out!

Hire me or my troupe for your next gathering...we'll make it an event your guests won't forget!

<p>Judson Church was completed in 1893 at a cost of $240,578, but keeping it standing has cost significantly more than that. Designed by architects McKim, Mead, &amp; White, the building was packed with delicious (and expensive) details such as LaFarge stained glass windows and a marble baptistry by American Renaissance sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. It is, quite frankly, gorgeous. In 1921, Bob's great grandmother founded the Judson Health Center in its basement. In 1966 the building received landmark status, which protected it from demolition but also from half-baked (or under-funded) repair and restoration work.

<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b><br/></b><div>First off, <b>THANK YOU</b> for stopping by!  As you may already know, I’ve started putting together the pieces of producing Nicholas Kazan’s terrific play BLOOD MOON. I first learned about the play in my acting class.  My teacher would assign it on occasion and the first time I read it, I was HOOKED. The play will have its run here in New York City at the <b>Workshop Theatre Company</b> on their <b>Main Stage</b> in March 2015.  Wow, 2015!  Weird to say.  But, I digress.<p></p>
<p>                                   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/875591/files/20140922205106-IMG_0753.jpg?1411444266"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>To get to the point, in order to make this happen I need your help. Putting up a play takes a lot of time, planning and, unfortunately, money.  But the good news is you can be part of making this play come to life by donating <b>TODAY</b>!  The even better news is that Fractured Atlas is fiscally sponsoring the production.  For those of you who don't know, Fractured Atlas is a non-profit organization that does it’s best to minimize any obstacles that prevent artists from sharing their art.  What does this mean for you?  Well, any money you donate is <b><i>TAX DEDUCTIBLE</i>.</b>  Woo Hoo!</p>
<p>                                           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/875572/files/20140922203955-OK-happy-face_full.jpeg?1411443595"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Giving today will allow me to hire the people I need <b>NOW</b> before they are snatched up by some other evil group of actors.  Postcards can be printed.  The set designer can start building the set.  Rehearsal space can be rented.  You get the idea.  All you have to do is pick your perk, donate and keep the wheels moving (Cliche #1).</p>

<p> I’ll never forget going to see The Wiz when I was about 10 years old.  It had a permanent and life changing effect on me.  In this day and age I really feel the world needs to have music and art and theater more then ever.  I’ve always been a believer that education feeds the mind, but the arts give us our humanity.  There are so many stories about people whose lives have been touched by seeing a great show.  I even know of people who have been <b>healed</b> by plays that deal with personal and relevant topics. At its best, theater can change lives.</p>
<p>It’s people like you who make this happen.  When you donate or buy a ticket you become part of a bigger community.  A better community.  It sounds cheesy, but you do make the world a better place (yes, I DID say that). </p>
<p>I also want to let you in on one more thing.  This play deals with violence against women.  Coincidentally, it’s also a subject that is very much in the news these days. As soon as I found out I got the rights to this play, even before the news stories broke, I made a promise to myself.  I don’t feel right doing this kind of play without giving something back.  So, I’m going to be donating a <b>portion of every ticket sold</b> to an organization that <b>supports women of violence</b>.  Actually, by donating to the fundraising campaign you are giving <b>TWICE</b>.  Once to the arts.  Once to women who are in need of help.  All of this gets done because of you!  As I said, ""pick your perk"", donate and let’s get the ball rolling (third time's the charm ;~)</p>
<p>I want to thank you for taking the time to read this.  I know your time is precious and I appreciate you listening.  I hope that you are very well!</p>
<p><b>P.S.</b>  A very good friend once told me that people don’t invest in things, they invest in people.  I hope that you believe enough in what I’m doing to DONATE to the cause.</p>
<p><b>More Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Spreading the word will help SO much.  Please tell others about the campaign. Share with your friends and family. Share on Social Media.  Sharing is caring ;~)</p>

 I’ll never forget going to see The Wiz when I was about 10 years old.  It had a permanent and life changing effect on me.  In this day and age I really feel the world needs to have music and art and theater more then ever.  I’ve always been a believer that education feeds the mind, but the arts give us our humanity.  There are so many stories about people whose lives have been touched by seeing a great show.  I even know of people who have been healed by plays that deal with personal and relevant topics. At its best, theater can change lives.
It’s people like you who make this happen.  When you donate or buy a ticket you become part of a bigger community.  A better community.  It sounds cheesy, but you do make the world a better place (yes, I DID say that). 
I also want to let you in on one more thing.  This play deals with violence against women.  Coincidentally, it’s also a subject that is very much in the news these days. As soon as I found out I got the rights to this play, even before the news stories broke, I made a promise to myself.  I don’t feel right doing this kind of play without giving something back.  So, I’m going to be donating a portion of every ticket sold to an organization that supports women of violence.  Actually, by donating to the fundraising campaign you are giving TWICE.  Once to the arts.  Once to women who are in need of help.  All of this gets done because of you!  As I said, ""pick your perk"", donate and let’s get the ball rolling (third time's the charm ;~)
I want to thank you for taking the time to read this.  I know your time is precious and I appreciate you listening.  I hope that you are very well!
P.S.  A very good friend once told me that people don’t invest in things, they invest in people.  I hope that you believe enough in what I’m doing to DONATE to the cause.

On August 3rd, we did a showing of our new version of Moxie to enthusiastic audience response.

We can't wait to share our show with a broader audience!


Our Story








Pickpocket Theatre is Alana Eve Burman and Teresa Sparks. We're a young theatre company dedicated to producing original work and proving to you that theatre doesn't have to be quiet and serious, it's also a place to get rowdy and revel in the hilarious variety of human experience.  

Building on Moxie's success at the Boulder Fringe, we've taken a leap of faith and are bringing the play to the Vancouver Fringe in preparation for a cross-Canada tour next summer. The costs of taking a show on tour far exceed the costs of producing it in our home town and we need your help.



Here's a brief blurb about the show:

which we live? By helping us achieve our goal of creating this work, you
 are helping us answer these questions, and (we hope!) you to answer them for yourself.        Every individual involved is this project is generous with their 
time, talent, and knowledge. We teach, support, and volunteer in community, 
school, and studio based programs. We educate, encourage, love, and connect with a multitude of communities and ages to bring awareness to our art and all it 
entails: self-discipline, health, spatial awareness, 
musicality, emotional intelligence, creativity, problem solving, 
teamwork, self-confidence, goal setting...the list is endless. Through 
supporting this project, you are helping everyone of us grow and build our 
knowledge, which we can then pass on to those with whom we work.

read all the way down to this last paragraph, its unbelievably awesome that 
you took the time to do so.  I know how it feels to have 
someone ask for the money you work so hard for, so if you have already 
reached your donation budget, I completely understand. Please know that 
even passing this campaign on to anyone you know, who may be interested,
 could potentially make a difference and get us one step closer to our 
goal.

<p><em><br/></em>Dear friends, </p>
<p>We are <strong>Jessica Ruano</strong> and <strong>Victoria Grove</strong>, and thank you for visiting our IndieGogo page!</p>
<p>We're raising funds to bring our beloved production of <strong>'Sappho ...in 9 fragments' by Jane Montgomery Griffiths</strong> to the <strong>Edinburgh Festival Festival</strong> for the first time this year. This play tells the story of Ancient Greece's first love poet, juxtaposed with a modern-day romantic affair. </p>
<p>Following our sold-out extended run at the White Rabbit Theatre in London, we're transferring the show to The Rose Theatre, Bankside in May, before taking off on our Canadian tour in June, and then participating in the Edinburgh Fringe in August.</p>

<p><strong><br class=""Apple-interchange-newline""/>So, what's this money paying for? </strong></p>
<p>Touring theatre is expensive! But so so worth it.</p>
<p>To cover Edinburgh venue costs alone, we're looking at paying <strong>£640.00.</strong> </p>
<p>We're hoping to surpass our goal so that we can afford to pay for marketing materials (<strong>£500.00</strong>), living expenses (<strong>£500.00</strong>), and other productions costs (<strong>£360.00</strong>) while in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>TOTAL <strong>£2000.00 </strong>to take this show to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>And why is this play so important to us?</strong></p>
<p>We are passionate about presenting the works of female writers and telling women's stories, especially with regards to meaningful relationships between women. </p>
<p>Sappho is a strong, powerful, intelligent, witty, and vibrant character. Roles like this for women are far too rare in theatre and film, and we think this one is worth celebrating.</p>
<p>Also, the historical Sappho - while prolific and tremendously influential as a poet and a lesbian icon - is relatively unknown, and very little is known about her. We would love the opportunity to share her moving and poignant life's work with as many people as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Your generosity and support with contribute to the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Highlighting theatre work by a female playwright, female director, female designer, and female actor</li>
<li>Presenting a meaningful and complex love story between two women to international audiences</li>
<li>Encouraging UK/Canadian touring theatre and nurturing relationships between international artists</li>
</ul><p> </p>

</p><p>A world premiere by Houston playwrights Doug
Williams and Donna McKenzie that explores the nature of our loves, the passions
of our lives, and the turbulence of our times.</p>
<p><b>The
story</b></p>
<p>The lives of a successful romance novelist and
her sturdy husband are radically altered overnight by the sudden appearance of
her former lover. But he’s now a dangerous fugitive wanted by the FBI for
crimes against corporate America, and he needs her help for what may be his
boldest, most desperate – and likely final – act. It forces her to face all of
her choices and to examine the shifting lines between love and marriage, trust
and betrayal, and life and death.</p><p><b>Run dates and venue</b></p><p>Friday and Saturday, March 25 and 26 @ 8 p.m.; Sunday, March 27 @ 3 p.m.; Thursday, March 31 @ 7:30 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, April 1-2 @ 8 p.m. Midtown Arts &amp; Theater Center (MATCH), 3400 Main St., Houston.</p>
<p><b>A
quarter-century path to production</b></p>
<p><i>The
Boundary</i> was born more than 25 years
ago in a playwrights group, when Doug Williams began writing the story of a
crisis management expert who could not handle a crisis in his own life. Overtly
political (the title then was <i>A More Or
Less Perfect Union</i>), it was put on the back burner when Williams began
stage acting, his early plays were produced in New York, and he started
drifting toward screenwriting.</p>
<p>Then in October 2013, he revived the project,
finishing a working draft a year later. This version was still political and
had the same basic structure, but had shifted to larger themes about how, why,
and who people love. It was not a natural subject for him. A onetime activist
who worked with African-Americans in George Wallace’s Alabama, he was more of a
thinker than a feeler.</p>
<p>Enter Donna McKenzie, a fixture in Houston
radio for three decades who has both acted and directed for the stage. She
attended a May 2015 table read of the play, and began asking Williams questions
about the characters and their motivations, choices, fears, and dreams. It
became very clear, very fast, that she could enrich and deepen the play’s
emotions without sacrificing some of the more political themes Williams wanted
to explore. They became collaborators.</p>
<p>Over the next five months, they rewrote the
script twice. McKenzie reshaped the characters in large and small ways, plugged
holes in the narrative, and made sure that the story had as much (or more)
heart than head. Williams took a lot of notes and bemoaned the fact that what
just erupted from her brain would take him three weeks to come up with. Although
they would spar on occasion, he says McKenzie won about 90 percent of the
debates, and for one simple reason: She brings logic to a knife fight. </p>
<p>They finished a production draft in October
2015. At the end of the year, the recently established Dirt Dogs Theatre
Company agreed to produce the pay, with Malinda L. Beckham signing on as
director. Dirt Dogs had particular appeal to McKenzie and Williams, not only
because Beckham had directed politically themed love stories in the past, but
also because the company was devoted to – and respectful of – playwrights. </p>
<p>In early 2016, the play was scheduled for a
two-week run at Houston’s new MATCH complex, one of city’s leading arts venues.</p>
<p><b>A budget
with a difference – and a commitment to actors</b></p>
<p>The director, design team, and writers of <i>The Boundary</i> have agreed to take no
money for their work. After the hard costs for the play are covered – venue,
insurance, set construction, etc. – the remaining profits will go to the 12
actors and crew.</p>
<p>We hope to raise a minimum of $8,100, with the
fixed costs as follows:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Venue:
$4,100</p>

<p>Obviously, ticket sales will defray some of
these costs. But for the most part, the project will be supported by people
like you, who believe that actors should have opportunities for their work to
be seen – and to be paid for their time and talent.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate your time and
consideration, and hope to see you at MATCH for the show.</p>

<h3>-The Gravity BeTween &amp; our Goal-</h3>
<p>The GraviTy beTween is a multidisciplinary quartet (2 dancers, 2 musicians) choreographed by Jacqueline Bulnes, former Soloist of the Martha Graham Dance Company and Soloist of the Limón Dance Company, with original live music by the Danish composer, Niklas Emborg Gjersøe. The piece is about human connection across borders and we seek opportunities to refine our work through performances, workshops and artist talks.  <strong>Our objective is to bring the quality of training offered in New York City Institutions to students across Denmark.</strong> </p>
<p>In November 2018, we toured Denmark for two weeks reaching approximately 500-700 (students &amp; audiences).  This June 2019, our estimations lead us to believe we will reach approximately 1000-1500 (students &amp; audiences).</p>

<p><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Short Summary<br/></p><p>Hello! <br/></p>
<p> I am Avinoam Silverman, a former Soloist with the
National Ballet of Canada and now a freelance choreographer and dance teacher.
 I have always been very <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/diversion-a-new-dance-film/edit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>interested</span></a> in choreography and
creation as a whole. During my years with the National Ballet I created a
number of pieces for choreographic workshops using dancers from the company.
Each time further developing and exploring my choreographic voice. Since
retiring from the National Ballet I have collaborated with Cadence
Ballet, Ballet Jörgen and 60x60 Dance, creating new and original dance
works. Now, as a freelance choreographer, I am looking to continue this
journey by creating a new and exciting dance film. </p>
<p>I am very passionate and excited about this new project. So
far I have started choreographing a short dance piece with 4 wonderful,
talented dancers who have been graciously volunteering their time. I have also
been collaborating with an amazing videographer, who I am trusting to bring my
vision to life. </p>
<p> The process for this dance film has been inspired by
the fast pace go-go-go-go world where our attention gets pulled left, right and
centre. From the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/diversion-a-new-dance-film/x/1900300"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>latest phone model to the

There is nothing wrong with enjoying
material things, but if we define ourselves by what we have and own,
including what we wear, we are creating a really limited view of who we truly
are. I believe that we need to start looking inwardly for true meaning in
life as the external things are impermanent, but our essence is eternal.</p>
<p>Using a thematic plot line, this dance film will tackle
these ideas by featuring two characters. A women on a<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/diversion-a-new-dance-film/edit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> <span>shopping</span></a> spree, driving around a
city and a male dancer heading to a rehearsal with 3 supporting female
performers. The climax of this dance film showcases an accident where the
male dancer gets hit by the woman driving her <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/diversion-a-new-dance-film/edit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>car</span></a>. Emphasizing the
fragility and preciousness of life, I am aiming to shed some light on the
importance of finding true meaning and lasting values by looking
inwardly instead of outwardly. </p>
<p>None of this will be possible without your support. Please
help us reach our goal of $4,000 by making a donation. By helping us bring this
important piece to life you will be a part of taking it from monologue to
dialogue. It is only with your help that we can produce our work and we appreciate

far I have started choreographing a short dance piece with 4 wonderful,
talented dancers who have been graciously volunteering their time. I have also
been collaborating with an amazing videographer, who I am trusting to bring my
vision to life. 
 The process for this dance film has been inspired by
the fast pace go-go-go-go world where our attention gets pulled left, right and
centre. From the latest phone model to the
""best""clothing labels …  all
these things are external and cosmetic. There is nothing wrong with enjoying
material things, but if we define ourselves by what we have and own,
including what we wear, we are creating a really limited view of who we truly
are. I believe that we need to start looking inwardly for true meaning in
life as the external things are impermanent, but our essence is eternal.
Using a thematic plot line, this dance film will tackle
these ideas by featuring two characters. A women on a shopping spree, driving around a
city and a male dancer heading to a rehearsal with 3 supporting female
performers. The climax of this dance film showcases an accident where the
male dancer gets hit by the woman driving her car. Emphasizing the
fragility and preciousness of life, I am aiming to shed some light on the
importance of finding true meaning and lasting values by looking
inwardly instead of outwardly. 
None of this will be possible without your support. Please
help us reach our goal of $4,000 by making a donation. By helping us bring this
important piece to life you will be a part of taking it from monologue to
dialogue. It is only with your help that we can produce our work and we appreciate
your consideration and generosity!

<h2><strong>The Play</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Molly Bloom-Lately </em>is the story of a young girl who is singled out on her first day of third grade for being the smallest in her class.  With the help of an interesting and entertaining cast of characters and some amusing mishaps along the way, we watch as Molly learns what it means to be uniquely her and witness a surprise ending that shows even the smallest among us have something to share.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Written by Ashleigh Catsos with music by Brian Ray Stearns, this children's theater piece both entertains and educates, providing its audience with the reminder to celebrate the YOU that you are and to always be kind even when others are not.  In turn, the story highlights tools to effectively deal with a bully scenario by demonstrating positive ways to stand up for oneself.</strong></p>
<h2>The History</h2>
<p><strong>Ashleigh Catsos, playwright, and Lindsay Hayes, Awaken Productions Artistic Director, have been friends since the summer before their senior years of college, when they met as interns at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center National Playwrights Conference.  The last seven years have seen them through acting successes and rejections, break-ups and a marriage, and years of nannying to pay the bills.  With so much time and love shared with kids, a children's play seemed like the natural next step.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>With your help, we will be bringing the important messages of this production to audiences throughout the five boroughs, starting with Brooklyn this fall.  What better way to begin an important dialogue about these topics than through theater?</strong></p>
<h2><strong>The Need</strong></h2>
<p><strong>In order to fulfill our production goals, we need to raise $5,500.  These funds will allow us to pay our cast and crew, which is a standard that Awaken Productions maintains as so often actors do not get paid for their hard work and time.  With your help we will also be able to pay for the materials for our set, costumes, rehearsal space, and publicity materials...just to name a few!  </strong></p>
<h3><strong>How YOU Can Help</strong></h3>
<p><strong>It is easy to support Awaken through this campaign with various thank yous and perks along the way.  Any amount you can share is much appreciated! As a supporter of <em>Molly Bloom-Lately</em>, you can feel confident that you are helping to breathe life into a project with an important and heartfelt message.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><em>Awaken Productions is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization, and therefore all contributions are tax-deductible.  </em></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><strong>In the Fall of 2010 Awaken successfully staged a full production in NYC's Theatre District.  Through the generous contributions of our supporters and Awaken's strict budgeting and financial management, we were able to get the entire production paid for as well as pay the actors and crew members.

<h2>The Why</h2>
<p><strong><em>Molly Bloom-Lately</em> is not only entertaining for children and adults alike, but it carries the significant message of finding self-esteem and confidence, the importance of friendship, and provides tools for dealing with bullying in a healthy and productive way.  It seems like every other news story lately is about a case of bullying and its horrific aftermath, which makes us feel even more passionate about sharing this play's powerful message.  <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>It is important to Awaken that any new project allows for the company to work toward and fulfill our mission. </span></strong></p>
<h3><strong>MISSION</strong></h3>
<p><strong>As artists we strive to enable our audience to recognize the shared connection we all have as human beings. We desire to incite something more in them: to stir them to action, to look closer at themselves, to acknowledge the truth, or to simply love more fully...</strong></p>
<p><strong>to AWAKEN the full human potential in each of us.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>That mission is exemplified in the story, characters, and lessons<em> of Molly Bloom-Lately </em>and we cannot wait to share it with you!</strong></p>

Ci sono storie che non si possono dimenticare, aggiungiamo noi. </p><p>Da un intuizione di Simone Sibillano, già conosciuto dal pubblico teatrale prima per le sue iterpretazioni in musical di successo (Jesus Christ Superstar, Aladin, Robin Hood, Biancaneve,etc) e dopo per le regie e scritture di diversi testi teatrali(America-il musical; Il primo Papa; Le sorelle Frank; Violetta Il musical) nasce la storia di Antonietta e Gabriele, raccontata dalle labbra inaridite dal tempo ma ricche della passione del ricordo, di un vecchio, un tempo portiere di un antico palazzo della Roma del Fascio, merita riflessione e ricordo.  Era bella ricorda er Sor Fernando Antonietta “la più bella pischella der quartiere” tratteggiando l’archetipo della popolana vulcanica, della donna colma di umanità…”poi s’era accasata il marito, i figli, le bollette da pagare, ma l’occhi, quell’occhi,  anche coll’occhiaie della fatica, chi se li scorda più”. <br/>Un tempo, quello della quotidianità, nella Roma fascista che troppo nascondeva dietro le tendine ricamate delle finestre dei caseggiati popolari. Lenzuola stese al sole di una Roma a Maggio, profumo di sapone e glicine, pantofole sdrucite e calze rammagliate, nell’orgoglio fascista della Patria. Fuori da quell’ambiente domestico il Mondo segna il suo tempo, anticipando il dolore di una guerra che intride  lenzuola che garriscono come bandiere del sangue dei figli che, Antonietta ancora non lo sa, sacrificherà a  quell’Adolf Hitler che, con Mussolini in testa, Roma attende con venerazione.  “Me chiedeva i giornali la sora Antonietta - racconta il portiere – ritagliava tutti gli articoli sul Duce”.  <br/>Dirimpettaio Gabriele, lo sapeva er Sor Fernando quello che si bisbigliava su di lui, ma non gli interessava: “Era un gran signore, educato, salutava, me dava la mancia a Natale e a Pasqua, parlava a bassa voce…dalla finestra sua sortiva quella musica americana che er Fascio proibiva, mortacci loro…me piaceva sta a sentì mentre pulivo er cortile del Palazzo… era musica de vita de gioventù vera altro che Giovinezza”…<br/>Una maratona nel tempo e nello spazio: microstoria di due vite umane, rette in parallelo, destinate a non incontrarsi mai se non fosse quell’inopinata fuga del pappagallino di Antonietta, quarantenne madre di sei figli che, volato via dalla finestra,  finisce sul davanzale del dirimpettaio. La donna si reca così dal vicino: è Gabriele affascinante, modi bizzarri e sfrontati, un incontro destinato a rovesciare prospettive  e visioni dei loro mondi. Prologo di una tragedia, prologo di una educazione al bello che Gabriele, il giornalista omosessuale, regala a Antonietta, prima di restituirla , per breve tratto alla sua falsa normalità -la guerra urge  e tutto cambierà – prima di recarsi al confino. Viaggio senza ritorno.</p><p><strong>Interpreti</strong></p><p>​Due i protagonisti Brunella Platania e Simone Sibillano : una intesa profonda nella scena, una capacità di essere vivi e veri che non potrà non affascinare.

Ci sono storie che non si possono dimenticare, aggiungiamo noi. Da un intuizione di Simone Sibillano, già conosciuto dal pubblico teatrale prima per le sue iterpretazioni in musical di successo (Jesus Christ Superstar, Aladin, Robin Hood, Biancaneve,etc) e dopo per le regie e scritture di diversi testi teatrali(America-il musical; Il primo Papa; Le sorelle Frank; Violetta Il musical) nasce la storia di Antonietta e Gabriele, raccontata dalle labbra inaridite dal tempo ma ricche della passione del ricordo, di un vecchio, un tempo portiere di un antico palazzo della Roma del Fascio, merita riflessione e ricordo.  Era bella ricorda er Sor Fernando Antonietta “la più bella pischella der quartiere” tratteggiando l’archetipo della popolana vulcanica, della donna colma di umanità…”poi s’era accasata il marito, i figli, le bollette da pagare, ma l’occhi, quell’occhi,  anche coll’occhiaie della fatica, chi se li scorda più”. Un tempo, quello della quotidianità, nella Roma fascista che troppo nascondeva dietro le tendine ricamate delle finestre dei caseggiati popolari. Lenzuola stese al sole di una Roma a Maggio, profumo di sapone e glicine, pantofole sdrucite e calze rammagliate, nell’orgoglio fascista della Patria. Fuori da quell’ambiente domestico il Mondo segna il suo tempo, anticipando il dolore di una guerra che intride  lenzuola che garriscono come bandiere del sangue dei figli che, Antonietta ancora non lo sa, sacrificherà a  quell’Adolf Hitler che, con Mussolini in testa, Roma attende con venerazione.  “Me chiedeva i giornali la sora Antonietta - racconta il portiere – ritagliava tutti gli articoli sul Duce”.  Dirimpettaio Gabriele, lo sapeva er Sor Fernando quello che si bisbigliava su di lui, ma non gli interessava: “Era un gran signore, educato, salutava, me dava la mancia a Natale e a Pasqua, parlava a bassa voce…dalla finestra sua sortiva quella musica americana che er Fascio proibiva, mortacci loro…me piaceva sta a sentì mentre pulivo er cortile del Palazzo… era musica de vita de gioventù vera altro che Giovinezza”…Una maratona nel tempo e nello spazio: microstoria di due vite umane, rette in parallelo, destinate a non incontrarsi mai se non fosse quell’inopinata fuga del pappagallino di Antonietta, quarantenne madre di sei figli che, volato via dalla finestra,  finisce sul davanzale del dirimpettaio. La donna si reca così dal vicino: è Gabriele affascinante, modi bizzarri e sfrontati, un incontro destinato a rovesciare prospettive  e visioni dei loro mondi. Prologo di una tragedia, prologo di una educazione al bello che Gabriele, il giornalista omosessuale, regala a Antonietta, prima di restituirla , per breve tratto alla sua falsa normalità -la guerra urge  e tutto cambierà – prima di recarsi al confino. Viaggio senza ritorno.Interpreti​Due i protagonisti Brunella Platania e Simone Sibillano : una intesa profonda nella scena, una capacità di essere vivi e veri che non potrà non affascinare. Due performer di razza  noti al grande pubblico del Musical e non solo capaci di convogliare l’interesse sia dei  loro fans  sia di chi ama ascoltare – leit motive e parole storie archiviate troppo in fretta Simone SibillanoNel 1998 si diploma all’Istituto Statale d’Arte Sacra per l’Arredamento e la Decorazione della Chiesa.Dal 1996 al 1998 studia canto lirico con il baritono R.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our senior acting class at Elon University is responsible for producing two full length shows and this includes fund raising! We have selected <em>Columbinus</em> by Steven Karam and PJ Paparelli and <em>Beautiful Bodies </em>by Laura Shaine Cunningham. We are all passionate artists and these are two powerful pieces that we believe are worth sharing with the world.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order to produce a show, there are a number of things we have to pay for, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rights for the shows</li>
<li>Set materials</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Publicity</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why We Are Doing It</h3>
<p>Both <em>Columbinus</em> and <em>Beautiful Bodies</em> deal heavily with important and relevant social issues. <em>Columbinus</em> is a theatrical docu-drama about the events that took place at the Columbine high school massacre. With the recent surge in teen violence, this production couldn't be more relevant or important to share with the public. <em>Beautiful Bodies</em> is a story of a group of women coming together at major transition points in their lives. With themes of friendship, and body image, we think this is a really important piece to share with young adults. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are college kids so we know as well as anyone that money can be tight at times. If you can't donate today, please consider sharing our project on any form of social media you can. Facebook, twitter, and anything else you can possibly imagine. </p>
<p>Also, come see our shows! They run at Elon University's Black Box Theater from Nov 14th-18th. Thank you so much for your time!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to truly bridge the gap and cover all expenses, we are exploring various fundraising opportunities as we strive to raise $6000.  Reaching our Indiegogo Campaign Goal of $3000 will bring us halfway there.  Any funds raised beyond the $3000 will, of course, bring us closer to our overall target.  Should we raise more than $6000 from Indiegogo and our 50-50 Raffle, we will set those funds aside for Summer Dance Workshop 2014.  What a wonderfully exciting gift that would be for dance in the Sonoma Valley and surrounding communities!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With arts education at risk in so many schools, what is available to the students at Sonoma Conservatory of Dance's Summer Dance Workshop is invaluable.  Dance helps students to ground themselves, work as a team, learn patience and perseverence, all skills that will help them in the academic environment as well as life, as they mature into adulthood.</p>

HISTORY OF CRUEL TEARS
Originally
commissioned by the Persephone Theatre in 1975 (Brian Richmond, Artistic
Director), Cruel Tears is a
contemporary retelling of Shakespeare’s Othello,
transposed into the world of Saskatchewan truckers
Cruel
Tears went on to be
invited to the 1976 Cultural Olympics in Montreal and the United Nations
Conference for the Habitat in Vancouver
Cruel
Tears was one of the first major cross-Canada tours to originate from a
Western Canadian theatre company
SPANISH REVIVALIn 2006, in collaboration with the Universidad Veracruzana in Xalapa, Mexico,  Cruel Tears was redeveloped by Brian Richmond and Mercedes Bátiz-Benét (now Artistic Director of PUENTE Theatre) to become Lágrimas Crueles - the story of Cruel Tears transposed onto to Mexican soil.  The production was remounted twice, and was invited to the prestigious Teatro Salvador Novo at the National Arts Centre in Mexico City.  WHY THE NEW ADAPTATION?
There are three
main reasons we wish to pursue this new development of this classic work:

<h3>Bring Swing Back To Rosa Parks for ArtPrize</h3>
<p>For 9 years the Grand Rapids Original Swing Society has brought swing dancing to Grand Rapids with the belief that the community is a better place when people can come together to dance.  We have taught thousands of people of all ages.</p>
<p>However this summer swing dance at Rosa Parks Circle was put into jeopardy when non-dancers came to the park to cause trouble.  So we moved the dance indoors as a result.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">We miss the outdoor dance and want to bring it back for three nights Sept. 24th.  Oct 1st and Oct 8th from 7-10pm. </span><br/></p>

For 9 years the Grand Rapids Original Swing Society has brought swing dancing to Grand Rapids with the belief that the community is a better place when people can come together to dance.  We have taught thousands of people of all ages.
However this summer swing dance at Rosa Parks Circle was put into jeopardy when non-dancers came to the park to cause trouble.  So we moved the dance indoors as a result.  
We miss the outdoor dance and want to bring it back for three nights Sept. 24th.  Oct 1st and Oct 8th from 7-10pm. 

What We Need Help

The only way we can bring swing back is if we hire the added security the Grand Rapids Police say we need. We need to hire 5 police officers at $70 an hour for 3 hours.  This means $1050 just for security on each night. 
We also need to still pay for insurance, rent, permits, and sound system.  So for the three nights we need to raise around $5000 dollars.

Make Swing Night Outdoors again

Help us bring swing back to Rosa Parks Circle to show the troublemakers that you can not take this away from us. 
 Even if we can't raise the entire amount we hope to make enough for 1 night.  Anything over $5000 will be used to pay for more outdoor nights next year.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>What more can I say besides, THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME REACH MY GOAL! I am so appreciative to all who donated to this campaign. It is a heavy burden lifted off of my shoulders.

<h2>Welcome to my campaign,</h2>
<p>My name is Stacie Cannon, I'm from Portsmouth, Va and I'm 25 yrs. old. I attended Shenandoah University and graduated in 2009 with a BFA in Dance. Currently, I teach and dance in Washington D.C., but I will be moving to New York by the end of this summer. I was afforded the opportunity to attend Peridance Capezio Center's 2-year Certificate Program for professional dancers. My focus will be in the Ballet/Contemporary track.</p>
<h2>Why I need your help!!!   ($5,000)</h2>
<div>I need to raise <strong>$5,000</strong> for half of my tuition cost.<em><strong> </strong></em>The other half of my tuition cost will be matched, then my full tuition for the year will be paid off. Coming up with these funds on my own is more than a challenge...that's why I need your help! Please donate whatever amount you are willing to give. It all adds up in the end, right?!?!</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Why Peridance?</h2>
</div>
<div>The Certificate Program at Peridance Capezio Center is the perfect program for me at this point in my life. Getting to New York City to train and perform has always been on my list of ""dance goals"" since I was in middle school. The time is NOW!</div>
<div>    This program gives me the opportunity to continue to train on a professional level in a learning, competitive and nurturing environment in NYC. I will also be able to network with world-renowned teachers, choreographers and directors that I may not get the opportunity to meet outside of this program. Having 3-4 technique classes, five days a week, will significantly help to improve my technique, artistry and the confidence I will need to audition for major dance companies.</div>
<div>   One of my biggest goals as a dancer, is to join a major dance company that does tons of national and international touring (I love to travel). The Certificate Program has a large international connection that could introduce me to the possibilities of performing and teaching abroad. I really couldn't ask for more!</div>

ABOUT THE PROJECT


This Spring, my newest work, Antigone Sr./Twenty Looks or Paris is Burning at The Judson Church (L), will premiere over four nights at New York Live Arts from April 25 - April 28. 


Antigone Sr. is the culmination of eleven years of research and the apex in a series of choreographic works that come in five sizes: Twenty Looks or Paris is Burning at The Judson Church Extra Small (XS), Small (S), (M)imosa, Antigone (jr.) and now, Antigone(Sr.). All five sizes share the same proposition:  What would have happened in 1963 if someone from the Voguing ball scene in Harlem had come downtown to perform alongside the early postmoderns at Judson Church? 
Antigone Sr. proposes a look at the voguing dance tradition –a form of dance itself predominantly practiced by African-American and Latino gays, transsexuals and transgendered– and its relationship to the aesthetic foundations of ancient Greek classical theater, where men also played male and female roles. 


WHY VOGUING AND POSTMODERISM?
I was stunned to find out that voguing and Judson era postmodern dance started around the same historical time in the 1960’s—one downtown in Greenwich Village and one uptown in Harlem. Since 2001, my work has imagined what would happen if the two actually came together in dialogue to question and reflect together -- politically and aesthetically. 
 Of course, dance history speaks about Judson, but not voguing. Gérard Mayen, the collaborating dramaturg, has written, “Judson reunited middle and upper-middle class artists and audiences, white and culturally  selective, politicized, and convinced of the democratic scope of their privilege for an everyday gesture and body - one that was neutral and full of ‘authenticity.’ The voguing ballrooms brought together poorer artists and audiences, non-white, inspired by pop and fashion culture and a search for the ‘realness’ of gesture” --which turns out to reveal the artificiality being performed at the root of all social identities. â€¨â€¨
 I am most interested in how the imagination can re-think the “omissions” of history.  In this vein, performance can be a way in which we collectively re-imagine the impossibilities of history and thus make room for new possibilities in the world we make today. â€¨

WHY INDIEGOGO?
In April, nine incredible performers and designers will travel to New York to rehearse and premiere Antigone Sr. I spend a lot of time in Europe developing work and collaborating with wonderful artists there, but my work is inspired by and responds to the culture of the US, so to me, it is crucial to keep a home base and premiere the work in New York.
While it’s no surprise that it can cost a lot of money to sustain an international practice, the reality is that very few US grants cover international travel costs, particularly to bring artists from abroad to perform here. That’s why we are reaching out to friends and supporters, to help us make this project possible.
Antigone Sr.’s premiere has received the incredibly generous support of our presenter (above and beyond!!) and some longtime supporters. We’ve raised a substantial portion of the project budget, but travel and lodging remains the single largest expense for us to cover. We need to raise a minimum of $9,500 to get everyone over here and put a roof over their heads when they arrive. We have a great team working extremely hard to bring this work to New York and share it, and we are getting closer. With your help, we know we can get there!
 HEART,
Trajal and the creative team of Antigone Sr.

<div><span>Among all creatures on this earth, art is a uniquely human activity. In THE SHELTER PRESENTS: ART, four playwrights track the journey of the artist and examine art’s role in the human experience. This exploration spans time and genres, and in true Shelter style, produces a seamless blend of comedy and drama. <br/></span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div><span>“THE SHELTER PRESENTS: ART explores the journey of the artist from the birth of art in mankind to the birth of art in the individual man. From hope to desolation, THE SHELTER PRESENTS: ART examines the need to create and how it affects the relationships we have with our fellow human beings,"" stated The Shelter Co-Artistic Director Meghan E. Jones.</span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div><span>The four short plays are:</span></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Michael Sean McGuinness’ GLYPH – a cave comedy about the origin of the artist and his struggle to survive, directed by Catya McMullen. The cast of GLYPH will feature Alec A. Head, Chris Cardona, Andy Hassell, and Tania Verafied.<br/></span></li>
<li><span>Meghan E. Jones’ MARK MAKES ART – a play that examines two struggling parents whose child is creating brilliant, yet emotionally unsettling drawings, directed by Paco Lozano. This two-hander will feature Beth Jastroch and Dave Lankford.<br/></span></li>
<li><span>Michael Bernstein’s play ROBOT GIRL envisions a dystopian future, where a lone street artist calls out over airwaves searching for other signs of humanity in a lifeless, robot-automated world, directed by Beth Jastroch. The ROBOT GIRL cast will feature Olivia Killingswoth.<br/></span></li>
<li><span>Ginger Kearn’s THIS IS A PLAY ABOUT ARTISTS launches two self-righteous artists at one another, creating an absurdly funny – and unexpected – romantic conundrum, directed by Nicole Rosner. THIS IS A PLAY ABOUT ARTISTS will feature Ian Bell, Ginger Kearns and Michael Kingsbaker.<br/></span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div><span>The Shelter will also work with several local New York artists to create a large spectrum of art, spanning many disciplines. Art will be on display at the theatre, a different guest artist will create an original piece of art during each performance, and performance art designed by Melinda Smart will be integrated into the overall production.</span></div>
<div><span><br/></span></div>
<div><span>THE SHELTER PRESENTS: ART runs April 19 through 29, with performances Wednesdays through Fridays at 8:00pm, Saturdays at 3:00pm and 8:00pm and Sundays at 3:00pm at the Flamboyan Theater (at the CSV Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street).

Collaboratrice de longue date avec le chorégraphe Dave St-Pierre, elle a appris a laisser libre cours à son imagination en créant sur scène des images fortes, ludiques et émouvantes. Elle voulait chercher l'endroit où les mots n'ont plus leur place, explorer les travers du genre humain. Le Laboratoire est né.</p><p></p><h3>Le Projet</h3><p></p><p><i>Le Trou</i> est la 3ème création du Laboratoire. Écrite et mise en scène par Eugénie Beaudry, elle met en vedette des comédiens chevronnés; Édith Arvisais, Joseph Bellerose, Yannick Chapdelaine, Isabelle Guérard et Mariane Lamarre. Karine Galarneau est de nouveau à la barre des costumes et des décors, Anne-Marie Rodrigue Lecours à l'éclairage, Benoît Finley à la musique originale et Sonia Montagne à la régie et assistance à la mise en scène. Une équipe de rêve! </p><p>C'est un projet qui est inspiré du milieu dans lequel l'auteur a grandi; l'industrie de la foresterie. L'action se déroule dans un sous-sol, à la veille de la destruction d'un village inconnu dans le fin fond de la province suite à la fermeture de l'usine de pâtess et papiers de la ville. Les gens sont partis chercher du travail ailleurs. Aux nouvelle on nn'en parle pas. Tout le monde s'en sacre, finalement. Sara-Lee, complètement incapable de sortir de son sous-sol à cause de multiples phobies sociales, rassemblera tout ce qui lui reste de courage pour empêcher que sa ville ne s'éteigne définitivement. Son père, ancien maire de la ville devenu paralysé à la suite d'un AVC, et Jo, son bras droit, feront tout en leur pouvoir pour lui cacher la vérité jusqu'à la dernière seconde. </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">L'auteur joue encore une fois dans son terrain de jeu préféré; les bas-fonds de la société et les perceptions erronées qui entrainent les personnages vers un dénouement redoutable et inattendu.</span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Où iront vos sous?</h3><p>Vous pouvez vous associer au Laboratoire pour créer ce spectacle! Nous avons besoin de <b>2500$</b> qui seront intelligemment dépensés: </p><p><b>1500$</b> serviront à défrayer les coûts de la publicité (relations de presse, affiches, programmes, site web, médias), c'est essentiel pour amener le public au théâtre et obtenir des entrevues dans les médias. </p><p><b>1000$</b> qui serviront à payer en partie les locaux de répétition (110 heures X 10$ = 1100$ + taxes)</p><p>Évidemment, nous ne couvrirons pas toutes nos dépenses avec ce 2500$, il reste les costumes, les décors, le support technique (dvd, cd, éclairage), la papeterie, le comptable, et j'en passe, alors <b>n'hésitez pas à défoncer l'objectif de 2500$!!! </b></p><p>Personnalisez votre don! Dites-nous à quel genre de trou vous vous identifiez (!!!)</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Votre soutien est essentiel!</h3><p>L'auteur nous revient avec son style cru, sans détour. C'est un texte engagé, cinglant, les personnages y sont attachants, démunis devant la perte d'une amitié, d'un emploi, d'une vie. Certains y verront une critique de société, d'autres, l'histoire d'une fille asociale qui voulait se battre contre quelque chose de trop grand pour elle. </p><p>Ceux qui ont vu le spectacle <i>Gunshot de Lulla West</i> savent de quoi il est question. Les autres, qu'attendez-vous? Vous pouvez faire une grosse différence dans la production du spectacle! Une perruque coute 25$, des rembourrures pour le costume d'Édith, 10$. <b>Avec aussi peu que 10$, on peut faire beaucoup! </b></p><p>Avec votre précieux soutien, il nous sera possible de créer un univers riche, et d'enfin amener sur scène le sous-sol de Sara-Lee. Vous passerez une excellente soirée, on vous le garanti!</p><p></p><h3>Pas un rond?

Collaboratrice de longue date avec le chorégraphe Dave St-Pierre, elle a appris a laisser libre cours à son imagination en créant sur scène des images fortes, ludiques et émouvantes. Elle voulait chercher l'endroit où les mots n'ont plus leur place, explorer les travers du genre humain. Le Laboratoire est né.Le ProjetLe Trou est la 3ème création du Laboratoire. Écrite et mise en scène par Eugénie Beaudry, elle met en vedette des comédiens chevronnés; Édith Arvisais, Joseph Bellerose, Yannick Chapdelaine, Isabelle Guérard et Mariane Lamarre. Karine Galarneau est de nouveau à la barre des costumes et des décors, Anne-Marie Rodrigue Lecours à l'éclairage, Benoît Finley à la musique originale et Sonia Montagne à la régie et assistance à la mise en scène. Une équipe de rêve! C'est un projet qui est inspiré du milieu dans lequel l'auteur a grandi; l'industrie de la foresterie. L'action se déroule dans un sous-sol, à la veille de la destruction d'un village inconnu dans le fin fond de la province suite à la fermeture de l'usine de pâtess et papiers de la ville. Les gens sont partis chercher du travail ailleurs. Aux nouvelle on nn'en parle pas. Tout le monde s'en sacre, finalement. Sara-Lee, complètement incapable de sortir de son sous-sol à cause de multiples phobies sociales, rassemblera tout ce qui lui reste de courage pour empêcher que sa ville ne s'éteigne définitivement. Son père, ancien maire de la ville devenu paralysé à la suite d'un AVC, et Jo, son bras droit, feront tout en leur pouvoir pour lui cacher la vérité jusqu'à la dernière seconde. L'auteur joue encore une fois dans son terrain de jeu préféré; les bas-fonds de la société et les perceptions erronées qui entrainent les personnages vers un dénouement redoutable et inattendu.Où iront vos sous?Vous pouvez vous associer au Laboratoire pour créer ce spectacle! Nous avons besoin de 2500$ qui seront intelligemment dépensés: 1500$ serviront à défrayer les coûts de la publicité (relations de presse, affiches, programmes, site web, médias), c'est essentiel pour amener le public au théâtre et obtenir des entrevues dans les médias. 1000$ qui serviront à payer en partie les locaux de répétition (110 heures X 10$ = 1100$ + taxes)Évidemment, nous ne couvrirons pas toutes nos dépenses avec ce 2500$, il reste les costumes, les décors, le support technique (dvd, cd, éclairage), la papeterie, le comptable, et j'en passe, alors n'hésitez pas à défoncer l'objectif de 2500$!!! Personnalisez votre don! Dites-nous à quel genre de trou vous vous identifiez (!!!)Votre soutien est essentiel!L'auteur nous revient avec son style cru, sans détour. C'est un texte engagé, cinglant, les personnages y sont attachants, démunis devant la perte d'une amitié, d'un emploi, d'une vie. Certains y verront une critique de société, d'autres, l'histoire d'une fille asociale qui voulait se battre contre quelque chose de trop grand pour elle. Ceux qui ont vu le spectacle Gunshot de Lulla West savent de quoi il est question. Les autres, qu'attendez-vous? Vous pouvez faire une grosse différence dans la production du spectacle! Une perruque coute 25$, des rembourrures pour le costume d'Édith, 10$. Avec aussi peu que 10$, on peut faire beaucoup! Avec votre précieux soutien, il nous sera possible de créer un univers riche, et d'enfin amener sur scène le sous-sol de Sara-Lee. Vous passerez une excellente soirée, on vous le garanti!Pas un rond? Pas de problème! Il y a des moments dans la vie où on voudrait aider, mais notre compte en banque, lui, ne peut pas. Qu'à cela ne tienne! Pour nous soutenir, vous nous aiderez autant en partageant ce lien! Parlez-en à vos amis, vos familles! Répandez!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi there! We're <a href=""http://www.interactstory.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">InterAct Story Theatre</a>, an educational theatre company based in Maryland dedicated to bringing performing arts programs to schools and communities throughout our region.  Our merry band of artists include theatre folk, dancers and choreographers, musicians, film and video mavens, creative opera makers, and multidisciplinary artists. We specialize in ""arts integration"" and ""applied arts"": we're experts at integrating the arts with classroom instruction to meet educational goals, and we love to find ways to explore big issues through the arts. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The project in this Indiegogo campaign is a great example of what we love to do.  Over the past year, our partners have asked us, ""Can you do a program with our students that talks about bullying?"" So we started a year-long investigation of how we can explore bullying through drama, and to see what all else is out there.  And one thing we discovered right away is that the issue is huge and complex, with no easy answers - since everyone's situation is different, the answers for each person is different.  So, it became really clear to us that our job isn't to provide an answer to the problem of bullying, but to open up dialogue about the issue and give kids tools and information they can use to combat bullying. With this in mind, we piloted a parent-staff-child 
workshop on bullying this spring and began developing workshops and residencies 
exploring bullying through drama. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This led us to writing <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Voytto Tech: a scifi fable. </span> This powerful new play for young audiences combines science, engineering and technology with a strong anti-bullying message.  In this play, Klipp Casey travels from a planet far, far away to study at Voytto Tech, the most famous science magnet school in the galaxy.  Right away, Klipp has trouble fitting in at his new school, and becomes a target for bullying.  What can he do? Who can he go to for help? And what can anyone do about the energy and waste problems on the planet? This interactive play is performed by two actors who become a variety of characters. The entire audience participates from their seats, becoming characters in the story and brainstorming possible solutions for Klipp's problems.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We're really excited about this project. It's our first new play since our new artistic director Ali Oliver took the reins of the company, and it's shaping up to be a great show.  Not only is this our first new work, but it's our first multimedia project, so it's a whole new world for us as a company. We're all energized by our progress so far. We had a really successful public reading this summer, have been polishing it and revising it, and are in production and rehearsal right now.  In the video, you'll hear from several artists in the project, and catch a glimpse of a ""table read"" rehearsal. We have several schools already who have scheduled this show for the fall--we just need your help to make it happen and get the show on the road! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Your donations will help us bring theatre into schools and help us make an impact on children's lives.  </span>Schools are clamoring for this kind of program: quality theatre for children that addresses the complex issue of bullying.  There is a real need for this in the schools, and schools have asked us to help fill this gap. We want to be able to fill this need, and we need your help to do it and do it well. <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">We want you to know that we will put every single penny you donate to work--whether we reach the campaign goal or not.</span> <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>We are committed to making <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Voytto Tech</span> 
happen--the question is how well can we do it, and how many kids can we 
reach. We are working tirelessly to raise funds and find creative ways 
to do more for less. The more 
funding we can raise, the better the project and the more children we 
can reach thanks to your generous support. Every little bit helps, and 
we are so, so grateful for any help you can offer. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Every little bit helps! </span>You'd be surprised at how far a $10 or $25 donation can go in the hands of theatre people (Or, if you're<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>a theatre person, maybe that's not news to you). And again, we will put
 every dollar to work, whether or not we meet our fundraising goal. We 
promise! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>So where's the money going?<br/>
</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Your dollars will help bring this powerful play to children in two important ways: </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1.  Technical equipment and know-how.</span>  Not only are we growing and stretching into new areas of theatre, we're going multimedia for the first time.  After all, it's a play about technology and science! This is a whole new area for us as a small touring theatre company, so not only are we investing in a raft of audio/visual and electronic equipment, we are hiring folks with expertise in how to make it happen. Our crack team of tech consultants are helping us figure out how to do it as economically as possible--but it still adds up!  So, your donations will help defray these costs, so that we can put the best multimedia experience in front of the kids seeing our play. <br/></p>
<p>At minimum, our multimedia costs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>37"" video screen</li>
<li>Rolling hardcase for the screen <br/>
</li>
<li>Power conditioner</li>
<li>Computer system/peripherals in order to run the audio and video during the performance</li>
<li>Cables, cables cables</li>
<li>Video filming/editing/production costs related to recording the audio/visual elements of the show</li>
<li>Music/sound composition/editing:  We're tickled to have a score composed by Helen Hayes award-winner Tom Teasley, and we want to do his wonderful work justice<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">2.  Taking it on the road. </span> InterActors tour just about everywhere - cities, suburbs, rural communities - and times are tough across the board.  We've seen our rural friends hit especially hard in the past year; two different school districts in our tour have seen roughly 50% cuts in funding! Sadly, the areas hit hardest by budget cuts are exactly those areas that need us the most; in some of the schools we visit, InterAct provides the only live theatre these children will see all year. And if the funds aren't there, the kids miss out. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We think that kids deserve quality theatre that really means something, and we're asking for your help to bring this play to them.  So, once our A/V costs are met, donations will go towards bringing Voytto Tech to schools and communities who otherwise would have little or no access to live theatre. </p>
<p>These costs include: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Personnel costs: we have a great group of pros working on this production.  The tour itself includes two professional actors who handle everything on the road from transportation to set up to strike. This on top of performing their parts!<br/>
</li>
<li>Transportation expenses: gas, vehicle costs, tolls, etc.<br/>
</li>
<li>Hotel and food for the actors while they're on the road; we try to keep costs down, so we can maximize your donation dollars. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>What do you get for your donation?</h3>
<p>All donations made to this project are tax deductible to the extent permitted by law, thanks to sponsorship by <a href=""http://www.fracturedatlas.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Fractured Atlas</a>.  Plus, there are perks for each level of contribution, ranging from shout-outs and acknowledgements to nifty InterAct gifts and more.  Donors at the top level will receive exclusive, limited-supply items like a CD by Tom Teasley (the composer of Voytto Tech's music) and a video of Voytto Tech with exclusive bonus material.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We'll be giving shout-outs by Facebook, Twitter and our own website. If you've got a Twitter handle, please be sure to let us know, so we can give you a proper mention. Thanks! <br/></p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p></p><p>I love going to the movies. It helps
me escape, imagine, feel, learn, and laugh. I love that what I might find
inspiring, someone else might find tasteless. What I might perhaps find funny,
someone else might find offensive. What I might find personally
transformational, someone else might decide is just fluff.  You get my
point. So in the Fall of 2012, after moving back to NYC from LA and leaving
behind friendships, my job, and everything that had made me feel comfortable I
found myself asking “now what”? I felt alone and directionless, and I sought
comfort in my old friend “the movies” to keep me company and help me escape. I
couldn't decide where to begin so I figured I'd rely on the so called “experts”
and took on tackling the American Film Institute’s Greatest 100 American Films
of All Time. To my surprise, I didn't lose myself, nor did I escape. Why?
Because somewhere along the journey I became frustrated by some of the choices
on the list. How was it possible that some of my favorite movies were nowhere
to be found? How could some of these films on the list actually be called “the
greatest of all time?” The answer was simple. Movies are art. Art is
subjective. Every person is unique and has their own filters and perspective
and that is when I realized that I don’t believe in “best of” lists. <br/></p><p></p>
<p>But I also realized that I suddenly
felt incredibly inspired and my creative juices began to percolate. After
watching film after film in rapid succession, something began to
happen. AFI's list began to take on a life of it's own inside my head and
all the films began to blend into one. And so I set out on a mission to
stitch-together the most absurd parody of ""the greatest 100 American
movies"" chosen from the list. I wanted to create a hilarious evening
of theatre, touching on a large well known body of work much like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_William_Shakespeare_(Abridged)"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><span>The Complete
Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)</span></i></a>had so
brilliantly done<i>.</i> It's taken nearly two years, countless
rewrites, endless amounts of caffeine, laughter, headaches, and
conviction. I've heard it come to life a few times with table reads thanks to
the incredible support of fellow artists who have in some way, shape or
form lent either their talent or insight into helping see my play to come to
life. </p>
<p>What if I asked you to close your
eyes and imagine what Star Wars would have been like if Katherine Hepburn had
been offered to play Princess Leia?  Or if Jimmy Stewart had played Oskar
Schindler? Keep them closed and imagine Bonnie and Clyde in Bedford-Stuyvesant
Brooklyn on the hottest day of summer about to rob the local pizza parlor in a
very Pulp Fiction kind of way. Did those images get your imagination running
wild?  Welcome to a quick glimpse of the crazy place that is my brain and
what you might expect to see live on stage with <i>The List</i>.</p>
<p>And although I wish I had the
scruples of, say, <i>Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid</i> or
even <i>Bonnie and Clyde, </i><u>I am setting out to raise money
the good old fashioned way, through asking kind folks such as yourself to help
contribute and help me realize this dream</u>. There will be no stick-ups or
guns involved, I promise. You see, putting up a show in NYC is <i><u>not </u></i><u>easy</u>.
To get a show produced in NYC doesn't take the west village but rather an
entire island.  There are so many costs associated with getting a play up
and running. I've been able to finance some of it on my own, but this show
deserves a world-class world premiere and I can’t do that alone! So if you,
like me, love art, believe in individuality, and the power of the movies and
the theater…please help me make my dream come true! There is no donation too
big or too small. And if you can't financially donate, that's okay, there are
still other ways that you can help and still make a difference: by
simply sharing this link with your friends and colleagues, you help
me get the word out there.  Who knows- perhaps someone YOU know is
the one that gets me to my fundraising goal! And <i>The List</i> is a sponsored
project of Fractured Atlas, the leading arts fundraising service non-profit.
Charitable contributions for ""The List""  are tax‐deductible to the
extent permitted by law. </p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>So here is the deal. To produce this
show and give it the premiere it deserves (hint: it deserves the kind of
premiere and run that raises eyebrows and the interest of the Off-Broadway
community!) it will take roughly $25,000. You wouldn't believe how even an
arguably simple show like this one really requires all the aspects of a bigger
production. Below are just a few of the costs categories associated with
getting the show up and running (all at a fraction of the market rate given how
committed my cast and crew is to making this project a reality!) </p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Casting Director</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Cast</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Designers</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Crew</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Rehearsal Space</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Set</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Costumes, Wigs, Props</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Marketing</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>Insurance/Fees</p>
<p>And that's only scratching the
surface!</p>
<p>Now what happens if I can't raise all
the money? Well, having produced several independent features and short
films, I know first hand the chaos that ensues when fundraising goals are at
risk and the relentlessness it takes to stay focused and meet the deadline of
getting the show produced no matter what. If I fall short, I do have some
contingencies and certain elements of the show will not be able to be fully
realized and artistic sacrifices will be made. I'll have to rework the budget
and call in even MORE favors from cast and crew. I'm hoping to not have to do
this, but we will not know the answers to those questions until the 30 days
from fundraising are up. I am hoping for the best and I am going to work at
this harder than I ever have. This show will be produced at all costs with your
contributions. I am a creative guy, and I've done this before...the show will
go on!</p>
<p>In the past, I've been fortunate
enough to have been involved with successful projects like the independent
films <a href=""http://weathergirlmovie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><span>Weather Girl </span></i></a>and<i> <a href=""http://6monthrulemovie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">6 Month Rule</a></i>.  I also know what
it's like to put my mind to something and stop at nothing to win which is how I
was able to succeed on the reality show <a href=""http://www.bravotv.com/thintervention-with-jackie-warner/season-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Thintervention

me escape, imagine, feel, learn, and laugh. I love that what I might find
inspiring, someone else might find tasteless. What I might perhaps find funny,
someone else might find offensive. What I might find personally
transformational, someone else might decide is just fluff.  You get my
point. So in the Fall of 2012, after moving back to NYC from LA and leaving
behind friendships, my job, and everything that had made me feel comfortable I
found myself asking “now what”? I felt alone and directionless, and I sought
comfort in my old friend “the movies” to keep me company and help me escape. I
couldn't decide where to begin so I figured I'd rely on the so called “experts”
and took on tackling the American Film Institute’s Greatest 100 American Films
of All Time. To my surprise, I didn't lose myself, nor did I escape. Why?
Because somewhere along the journey I became frustrated by some of the choices
on the list. How was it possible that some of my favorite movies were nowhere
to be found? How could some of these films on the list actually be called “the
greatest of all time?” The answer was simple. Movies are art. Art is
subjective. Every person is unique and has their own filters and perspective
and that is when I realized that I don’t believe in “best of” lists. 
But I also realized that I suddenly
felt incredibly inspired and my creative juices began to percolate. After
watching film after film in rapid succession, something began to
happen. AFI's list began to take on a life of it's own inside my head and
all the films began to blend into one. And so I set out on a mission to
stitch-together the most absurd parody of ""the greatest 100 American
movies"" chosen from the list. I wanted to create a hilarious evening
of theatre, touching on a large well known body of work much like The Complete
Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged)had so
brilliantly done. It's taken nearly two years, countless
rewrites, endless amounts of caffeine, laughter, headaches, and
conviction. I've heard it come to life a few times with table reads thanks to
the incredible support of fellow artists who have in some way, shape or
form lent either their talent or insight into helping see my play to come to
life. 
What if I asked you to close your
eyes and imagine what Star Wars would have been like if Katherine Hepburn had
been offered to play Princess Leia?  Or if Jimmy Stewart had played Oskar
Schindler? Keep them closed and imagine Bonnie and Clyde in Bedford-Stuyvesant
Brooklyn on the hottest day of summer about to rob the local pizza parlor in a
very Pulp Fiction kind of way. Did those images get your imagination running
wild?  Welcome to a quick glimpse of the crazy place that is my brain and
what you might expect to see live on stage with The List.
And although I wish I had the
scruples of, say, Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid or
even Bonnie and Clyde, I am setting out to raise money
the good old fashioned way, through asking kind folks such as yourself to help
contribute and help me realize this dream. There will be no stick-ups or
guns involved, I promise. You see, putting up a show in NYC is not easy.
To get a show produced in NYC doesn't take the west village but rather an
entire island.  There are so many costs associated with getting a play up
and running. I've been able to finance some of it on my own, but this show
deserves a world-class world premiere and I can’t do that alone! So if you,
like me, love art, believe in individuality, and the power of the movies and
the theater…please help me make my dream come true! There is no donation too
big or too small. And if you can't financially donate, that's okay, there are
still other ways that you can help and still make a difference: by
simply sharing this link with your friends and colleagues, you help
me get the word out there.  Who knows- perhaps someone YOU know is
the one that gets me to my fundraising goal! And The List is a sponsored
project of Fractured Atlas, the leading arts fundraising service non-profit.
Charitable contributions for ""The List""  are tax‐deductible to the
extent permitted by law. 
What I Need & What You Get
So here is the deal. To produce this
show and give it the premiere it deserves (hint: it deserves the kind of
premiere and run that raises eyebrows and the interest of the Off-Broadway
community!) it will take roughly $25,000. You wouldn't believe how even an
arguably simple show like this one really requires all the aspects of a bigger
production. Below are just a few of the costs categories associated with
getting the show up and running (all at a fraction of the market rate given how
committed my cast and crew is to making this project a reality!) 
• 
Casting Director
• 
Cast
• 
Designers
• 
Crew
• 
Rehearsal Space
• 
Set
• 
Costumes, Wigs, Props
• 
Marketing
• 
Insurance/Fees
And that's only scratching the
surface!
Now what happens if I can't raise all
the money? Well, having produced several independent features and short
films, I know first hand the chaos that ensues when fundraising goals are at
risk and the relentlessness it takes to stay focused and meet the deadline of
getting the show produced no matter what. If I fall short, I do have some
contingencies and certain elements of the show will not be able to be fully
realized and artistic sacrifices will be made. I'll have to rework the budget
and call in even MORE favors from cast and crew. I'm hoping to not have to do
this, but we will not know the answers to those questions until the 30 days
from fundraising are up. I am hoping for the best and I am going to work at
this harder than I ever have. This show will be produced at all costs with your
contributions. I am a creative guy, and I've done this before...the show will
go on!
In the past, I've been fortunate
enough to have been involved with successful projects like the independent
films Weather Girl and 6 Month Rule.  I also know what
it's like to put my mind to something and stop at nothing to win which is how I
was able to succeed on the reality show Thintervention
with Jackie Warner.I am in this to win this,
people!
If you have read all of this I
appreciate it :) Think about it, and in the meantime, whether you can
contribute a lot, or nothing but your love, go ahead and like our page on

We will be presenting company favorite <i>Stuck Together Pieces </i>(which premiered to sold out audiences in 2013) and Inclined's newest work <i>Temporize, </i> featuring Inclined's Leighann Curd &amp; Chie Mukai.

The Dance Complex, located in Cambridge MA just outside of Harvard University, has been presenting local, national, and international dancers since 1991, and it is the central hub for the Boston contemporary dance community. We are so thrilled to have our name added to it's roster of presented artists, but we cannot get there without your help! This is a huge opportunity for Inclined Dance Project. Most performing artists rarely get the chance to present work in their own resident city; it is that competitive! Inclined is extremely fortunate that we've been able to perform and dance in New York these past 6 years, and now we are even more fortunate to have this chance to bring our name and work to another city. Traveling to Boston will help to expand our name, our audience, and our own personal viewpoint as a group. Not many artists receive opportunities like this, so we are beyond thrilled that The Dance Complex has accepted us and invited us to their venue. This is a major milestone for Inclined, and it will help to open many more doors for us in the future. </p><p>In order to get to Boston, we need a bit more than Artistic Director Kristen Klein's pocket change in order to safely get to Massachusetts and to put on the best show we can. That's where you come in! </p><h3>Your Donation...</h3><p>Your generous donations will help Inclined in a multitude of ways! We need to get our 7 performers out of NYC and safely to Boston in March 2015. In order to do that, we need to raise at least $3000 to help cover the costs of:</p><ul>
<li>Bus Fare + Traveling Fees</li>
<li>Housing for our weekend in Boston</li>
<li>Venue Fees in relation to The Dance Complex, including rental costs and security deposits</li>

We’re performing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this summer with our new piece<em> In Real Life (IRL).</em> This devised two-hander explores what identity means in a contemporary age when technology can both enhance or manipulate our connection to the world.</p>
<p>Sheer Fiesty started working together last year to write and devise<em> IRL</em>. We met on <em>The Performer Project</em> which occurred in a converted community centre called The Albert in North London. This was a one-on-one interactive live art event which was inspired by relationships with food. We brought both the spectator and the performer physically close to the food substances, creating intimate one-off experiences in private rooms. We believe that Sheer Fiesty’s work can provoke audience’s thoughts about relevant concepts which need immediate attention. <em>In Real Life (IRL) </em>directly deals with the impact the internet has on modern relationships, offering multiple perspectives on the role of the catfished victim and the internet stalker themselves. </p>
<p><strong>Our Campaign: </strong>We are passionate about our work and consider the Edinburgh Festival an ideal platform to showcase our new performance. This opportunity would enable us to reach out to national and international communities that we think need to see our show. However we need £3000 to fund this project. With a venue confirmed just off the Royal Mile, we would have the ability to perform in a central location to a diverse range of audience members. All we need now is your generous donations to help make that happen. £3000 could help us pay for our venue in full and contrubute to the costs of marketing. The most effective tool in gathering audiences during the festival is flyering, talking to people on the street and postering every day. For that we need to order and print thousands of glossy flyers and posters, which we need your help to pay for!</p>
<p><strong>What we need: </strong>If you could spare a donation, big or small, you could us help us reach our target. We won’t be able to showcase our work at the festival without you. Your generosity could be the springboard for performing future shows in London and around the UK. </p>
<p><span><strong>What we can offer you: </strong>There are four tiers of sponsorship; Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. £15 will get you a subscription to our contributor’s monthly newsletter and your name will be mentioned in the Edinburgh show program.

<p>Lamplit are a company from Warwick University of three friends (Lissy Stowell, Molly Eedle and Lilith Wozniak). We spend a lot of time clowning around. Sometimes we play. Sometimes we dance. Sometimes we sing, loudly. Sometimes we just chat. We try not to take ourselves too seriously. Somehow we're making theatre.</p>
<p>We want you to see this theatre for free which is why we've chosen to go to PBH's Free Fringe. However, that doesn't mean that making the show is going to be free. Our major expenses include:</p>
<p>- Fringe Registration and Programme Fee</p>
<p>- Props and Costumes </p>
<p>- Marketing Materials</p>
<p>- Travel to Edinburgh</p>
<p>These are the main things that your money will contribute to (any extra funds will go towards a place to sleep).</p>
<p>We know there  are a lot of people asking for your money so we've tried to make the rewards feel worthwhile. That's why we haven't done cumulative rewards, so you can get what you actually want. Of course if you want more than one of something, go for it! </p>
<p>We hope to see you at the show. Donate now and you can walk haughtily past our bucket shaking!</p>

</p><p><b></b></p><b>What is Persephone? </b>
<p>We are devising an
interdisciplinary, wordless movement theater piece called <i>Persephone</i>.
 Using modern
dance and shadow work, we will tell the story of Hades stealing 
Persephone from
her mother and dragging her to his home in the underworld. Demeter, 
Persephone's mother, frantically searches the world for
her daughter while Hades seduces Persephone. Demeter's panic and despair
 brings about an eternal winter which consumes the land. Demeter finally
 does find her daughter, but not
how she expected, as Persephone has found power with Hades, taking on 
the mantle of the Queen of the
Underworld. As the tensions flair between the rulers of the realms,
Persephone must make a difficult choice in order to save the fabric of 
reality:
her newfound love and power and place in the world; or the comforting 
embrace
of her mother and family? </p><p><b>The Cast and Crew!</b></p><p>Persephone- Katy Tye</p><p>Demeter- Hope Endrenyi</p><p>Hades- Josh Porter</p><p>Shadow Ensemble- Jacky Beatrice, Grace Cuny, Dakota Ratliff, and Eric Berg!</p><p>Written and Directed by Katy Tye</p><p>Music by Dean Wray</p><p>Magic by Trigg Watson</p><p>Set and Light Design by Jonah Gutierrez</p><p>Marketing and Promotion by Adam A Anderson and the Striped Heart Crew
</p><p><b>What We Need: </b></p>
<p>Telling such an epic
tale will require some innovative means to convey the story in a way 
that is effective and powerful. To further create the separation between
 the
two worlds, we will be placing soil and ""light flowers"" made out
of el wire to serve as
Demeter's realm. We will also be using this space to explore how the 
changing of the seasons reflects the emotional and mental
state of Demeter after the loss her daughter. Shadows on the other hand,
 are a malleable and
versatile medium that can easily express the terrifying and magical 
beings that
would exist in the Underworld. Thus, Hades' realm will be performed 
completely
in shadow that will require the hanging of a huge muslin sheet that is 
capable of being raised and lowered. Finally, we will be using Trigg 
Watson as our magic consultant to
make seemingly impossible events come to life like characters phasing in
 and
out of solid sheets of fabric, and shadows affecting tangible objects.</p>
<p>Additionally, on<i> Persephone’s</i> opening night (October 31<sup>st</sup>)
PrismCo will be collaborating with House Party Theatre to throw a Halloween
after party featuring live bands, a costume contest, and a special performance
by House Party Theatre themselves!</p>
<p><b>Use of Funding</b></p>
<p>Your funds will be
used for the following purposes: </p>
<p>Paying our highly
specialized performers and designers for their work on this project.</p>
<p>Fabric to make our
panoramic, audience encompassing shadow screen </p>
<p>A quality projector
to give an even throw of light on the screens, allowing for sharper shadow
imagery. </p>
<p>El wire to create our
garden for Demeter</p>
<p>Our marketing and outreach campaign, which includes paying
for our design team and all of the posters, postcards, and t-shirts they will
create.</p>
<p><b>What You'll Get </b></p>
<p>Instead of thinking of this as just a fundraising campaign, we'd
like our funders to think of this as a VIP preordering system. At the
actual event tickets will be $15 each, but for a limited time only we will be giving all of our funders
the opportunity to pre-order their tickets to this beautiful show for just $10
each. </p>
<p>And for those of us who have been to a PrismCo show before, good
seats run out pretty fast, so why not guarantee that you’ll have the seat of
your choice? At $15, we will reserve a seat wherever you want it, and at $30
we’ll reserve those seats for you and a guest.</p>
<p>Additionally, we’ll be offering a ton of awesome perks that will
only be offered for this campaign only, like a video of our behind the
scenes process and some great deals on our PrismCo classes. Keep 
checking in as we will be offering more and more perks as we get closer 
to the final date!

</p><p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We have nothing but the highest expectations for PrismCo’s
effect on the Dallas arts scene. Not only are we offering a type of theatre
that is very rarely seen in the Dallas arts community, but we also hope our productions
will offer opportunities to a wide variety of artists from different
disciplines to showcase their work. For a lot of our visual, musical and
performing artists, these shows can serve as their chance to premiere in the
Dallas arts world, or hone their skills and try something completely new. We
want to make sure these artists’ amazing talents are seen by Dallas artistic
professionals and that they are fairly compensated for their incredible
talents.</p>
<p>Also, because of the nature of PrismCo’s wordless, movement based
theatre, our productions are an excellent medium for educational theatre, as we
are able to present a variety of myths and other artistic experiences to a
younger audience in a way that is engaging, and easily digestible for students
of all ages.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that PrismCo will ultimately help kick start
West Dallas’ artistic growth as the area transitions into a new noncommercial
arts district. With funding, we will not only be able to make our
company stronger, but we will be helping to diversify the Dallas community of
artists as a whole.</p><br/></div>","What is Persephone?

<p><strong><em>What is LET THE ANGELS IN?</em></strong></p>
<p>     “Let The Angels In” is an evening length benefit performance including the works of Nicole Bilbao, Letticia Camacho, myself Juliet Dolan, Shawn Garnier and Nessa Rodriguez. “Let The Angels In” will premiere June 28th, 29th 2013 at 8 pm and June 30th, 2013 at 3 pm in The Aldous Theater of Triskelion Arts in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. </p>
<p>      “Let The Angels In” purpose is to raise funds for Down syndrome research through the gift of dance. All profits raised will be donated directly to Alexander’s Angels a non-profit organization whose mission is to further raise the awareness and contributions and needs of individuals with Down syndrome. Alexander’s Angel’s is dedicated to raising funds for advocacy, service, and various other research organizations. 100 percent of the profit raised will be donated towards this organization. </p>
<p><strong>      Our Pledge: </strong>In order to cover the remaining costs towards the production of this performance, we need your help. Your donations will ensure that all production costs such as costumes, sound and lighting equipment, light design, rehearsal space, and theatre rental will be covered in full.</p>
<p>      My personal experience in having a loved one diagnosed with Down syndrome is the inspiration behind the production of this work. My youngest sister Jilian was born with Down syndrome July 24, 2002. By combining my passion for dance and my desire to help those with special needs I aspire to bring Down syndrome awareness to the dance community.</p>
<p>      Through my involvement in Queens College’s Student Choreography Showcases, I have raised funds for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (2011) and the Carcinoid Cancer Awareness Network (2012). This production will be my first opportunity piloting and producing my first of many evening length works in an effort to raise funds for various organizations in need. </p>
<p>     Other artists collaborating throughout the choreographic process of “Let The Angels In” include Queens College Dance Team Coach and Adjunct Professor Shawn Garnier, recent Queens College graduates, emerging choreographers and co-production managers Nicole Bilbao, and Letticia Camacho. “Let The Angels In” promises you to display a wide range of styles of dance including, modern, contemporary, and jazz to name a few. Each piece encompasses it’s own story and personality depicted by the uniqueness and voice of its choreographer. With your support we can help dance embrace and empower Down syndrome. </p>

<p>Juliet Dolan, recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in dance from Queens College. Prior to receiving her bachelor's, she received her associates in American Sign Language at Nassau Community College. While attending Queens College she played a dedicated role in their Student Choreography Showcases, Faculty Showcases, and joined their nationally ranked Dance Team. At the age of 7, Juliet began tapping at the South Shore School of Dance. By 12, she was studying ballet, jazz, contemporary,tap and modern at KJ Dance Theatre.  Juliet Dolan aspires to direct and choreograph benefit dance performances to raise funds and awareness for human rights causes. These past two years, Juliet combined her love of dance, and interest in philanthropic work by producing successful fundraisers for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and The Carcinoid Cancer Awareness Network.  Having a sister with Down syndrome makes this a cause very close to Juliet's heart. Juliet and her family have been involved with Alexander's Angels, Inc. for several years. By raising funds at the 2012 Queens College Summer Performing Arts Festival in their production of ""Sweat It"", and at ""Last Call"" in Farmingdale, New York, Juliet provided the basis for the production. </p>
<p><strong><em>Obstacles! </em></strong></p>
<p>    In effort to produce this show we have encountered several challenges along the way, such as obtaining the production space, and coordinating dance rehearsals. Although most individuals maybe interested in a live theatrical performance, we risk the possibility of people not attending. Our production location is far from our central social network. We are working hard to broaden our advertisements of this production in hopes to capture a wide audience. We risk people not receiving the information or taking an interest in this important cause. </p>

<div>My name is Brent Eickhoff, and I'm a senior Directing and Theatre Education Major at Ball State University in Muncie, IN. For my senior directing capstone, I am producing a production of Caryl Churchill's play <i>The Skriker</i>. </div>
<div>I first read this play two years ago and was immediately grabbed by its combination of magical realism and horror, as well as Churchill's unique use of language and movement to construct a truly unique theatrical experience. As a senior capstone, <i>The Skriker</i> is artistically, intellectually, and technically challenging to all members of my production team; a perfect piece for a senior thesis.</div>
<div>As is the case with many of Churchill's works, <i>The Skriker</i> has many social ties, as well. Themes of feminism, environmentalism, and post-partum disorders such as depression and psychosis run throughout the piece. In an effort to make the focus of this project less on my success as an undergrad, and more about the world at large, I have partnered with <a href=""http://www.postpartum.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Postpartum Support International</a>, to ensure that all profits from this performance support a worthy cause.

<div>If we don't reach our entire funding goal, the money we do gain will try to achieve these goals on a slighter budget. However, we believe that $500 is already quite a small budget, even for a minimal production of this piece. </div>

Combining the intimacy of film with the power of live performance, ETC has created a catalog of plays designed to be performed in any private living space. Providing an array of both established plays as well as original works, Epsilon has the perfect show for your next social gathering. We have built a team of award winning directors, writers, and actors, but we are still missing one vital piece. You!</p>
<p>We were founded by Grafton Doyle and Daniel Korth, two experienced actors, directors, and writers who come from the San Francisco Bay Area. They met while studying together at the Meisner Technique Studio and formed a friendship grounded in their shared  passion and aspirations for theater.  After performing a play in Grafton's apartment, the two realized the potential that this intimate theater experience brings and created a team and business model to make it possible. <br/></p>
<p><b>Daniel Korth</b>, founder and <i>Aristic Director</i>. Daniel graduated with a B.A. in play-crafting and dramaturgy from San Francisco State University and brings with him the experience of producing several independent productions and has helped form other theater companies such as 4th Mirror Productions. He has written and directed shows in San Francisco and San Jose and has a history of producing theater in non-traditional spaces. </p>
<p><b>Grafton Doyle</b>, founder and <i>C.E.O</i>. graduated from the Meisner Technique Studio in San Francisco in 2011.  Since then, he has produced and directed several shows in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Most recent works were selected for The Hollywood Fringe Festival and what is currently the Avery Schreiber Playhouse.  </p>
<p>We are also supported by an incredible team:</p>
<p><b>Shoshanna Chagall</b>, <i>Managing Director. </i>Armed with an MBA and a JD, she brings a strong business acumen and a 
flair for creativity to launch this novel production company. Her fresh 
yet informed perspectives were part of launching several successful technical incubators and artistic ventures . Years ago, an accidental dabble in the arts through a college performance playing Nora in Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House, confirmed a life-long love for all things Theater. Also, produced and acted in feature films<i>. <br/></i></p>
<p><b>Tessa Evelyn,</b><i style=""font-weight: bold;""> </i>board member</p>
<p><b>Bryan Becker, </b>director<br/></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Melanie Weisner</b>, director</p>
<p><b>Philipp Maximilian</b>, company member</p>
<p><b>Brandon Miradi</b>, company member</p>
<p>How We Work:</p>
<p>After selecting one of our plays, we set up a private consultation with you in your home.

<p>On the day of the performance, we will arrive at your home and work around you and your guests as we set up.

<p>The focus of our plays is on the writing and performances. Because you are sitting so close to the action, there is no need for elaborate sets and lighting. All the plays take place in residences, so the setting is already established just by being in the home.  We will bring in costumes and props along with minimal technology, but it is the story and performances that will transport you into another world. <br/></p>
<p>It is already a great feat to produce one play, much less a catalog. In addition, we have created a formula that can transport the play to any location. Your help will allow this all to come to life.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Who we are and What we're about! Epsilon Theater Company provides a new form of theater entertainment that brings the show to you. Combining the intimacy of film with the power of live performance, ETC has created a catalog of plays designed to be performed in any private living space. Providing an array of both established plays as well as original works, Epsilon has the perfect show for your next social gathering. We have built a team of award winning directors, writers, and actors, but we are still missing one vital piece. You!
We were founded by Grafton Doyle and Daniel Korth, two experienced actors, directors, and writers who come from the San Francisco Bay Area. They met while studying together at the Meisner Technique Studio and formed a friendship grounded in their shared  passion and aspirations for theater.  After performing a play in Grafton's apartment, the two realized the potential that this intimate theater experience brings and created a team and business model to make it possible. 
Daniel Korth, founder and Aristic Director. Daniel graduated with a B.A. in play-crafting and dramaturgy from San Francisco State University and brings with him the experience of producing several independent productions and has helped form other theater companies such as 4th Mirror Productions. He has written and directed shows in San Francisco and San Jose and has a history of producing theater in non-traditional spaces. 
Grafton Doyle, founder and C.E.O. graduated from the Meisner Technique Studio in San Francisco in 2011.  Since then, he has produced and directed several shows in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Most recent works were selected for The Hollywood Fringe Festival and what is currently the Avery Schreiber Playhouse.  
We are also supported by an incredible team:
Shoshanna Chagall, Managing Director. Armed with an MBA and a JD, she brings a strong business acumen and a 
flair for creativity to launch this novel production company. Her fresh 
yet informed perspectives were part of launching several successful technical incubators and artistic ventures . Years ago, an accidental dabble in the arts through a college performance playing Nora in Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House, confirmed a life-long love for all things Theater. Also, produced and acted in feature films. 
Tessa Evelyn, board member
Bryan Becker, director
Melanie Weisner, director
Philipp Maximilian, company member
Brandon Miradi, company member
How We Work:
After selecting one of our plays, we set up a private consultation with you in your home. Here we will go over the specifics of the production, discuss where and how the performance will be shown, and plan out our logistical design. All plays are ready to go and be molded to fit into any space.

<div>I'm excited to announce that my multi-media dance work, <i>Self Portrait</i> has been accepted into Triskelion Arts' 6th Annual Comedy in Dance Festival! The work will be performed at their new Muriel Shulman Theater in Greenpoint, Brooklyn on March 21st at 8pm. With this page, I'm aiming to raise the funds it will take to pay for logistical factors (rehearsal space, costumes, etc) and to pay the dancers I'm working with. Scroll down to learn more about me, the work, and how you can help.</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>A little bit about me...</b></div>
<div>I recently made the move to Brooklyn after spending most of my life in Florida (yes, I'm cold). I'm fresh out of Graduate School and hold an MFA in Choreography and Performance from Florida State University and a BFA in Modern Dance Performance from University of South Florida. In Tampa, FL, I danced for Moving Current Dance Collective and All Out Repertory Theatre. In 2009, I co-founded Shoes at the Door Dance Company (SatD) alongside Danielle Boe and Brooke Bissell (check out their website here: <a href=""http://www.shoesatthedoor.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.shoesatthedoor.org</a>). I served as an artistic director, choreographer, teacher, and performer with SatD until 2014. Following my desire for more training in multimedia production, I chose to attend FSU and take every dance technology course offered. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>A little bit about the work...</b></div>
<div>
<i>Self Portrait  </i>premiered in April of 2014 as a part of my MFA Thesis Concert.  This multimedia dance work follows a modern day social media subscriber and her multiple online personas. The social media phenomenon is reflected in video and still projections featuring colorful, Andy Warhol influenced design and accompanies a mix of gestural and space eating movements on the stage. The music, ""Magic Marker,"" was composed by Brian Petuch (check out his website here: <a href=""http://www.brianpetuch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.brianpetuch.com</a>). This work explores themes of narcissism, identity, and centers around the idea that online, you can be anyone, anything and as many different versions of yourself as you wish. The choreographic process took a year and a half and was done in collaboration with the cast (FSU dancers Mary Rebekah Bartos, Taylor Ennen, Ashley Goos, Emily Lievsay, Alyssa Morris, and rehearsal assistant/understudy, Veoletta Range). We discussed our own experiences with social media - how we think we project ourselves, how we think we are perceived, how we want to be perceived, how we perceive each other in person and online, and built movements out of our findings. Simultaneously, I drew up projection designs, took footage, edited, and repeated the process several times until what was on the screen complimented the movement and vice versa. </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>How you can help...</b></div>
<div>I have a magnificent new cast here that is working hard, commuting all over the city, and taking time off of their jobs for the show. I DESPERATELY want to compensate them for their enormous efforts. Currently, I am paying for rehearsal space out of pocket and must purchase costumes for the work as the original outfits belong to FSU.</div>
<div>Your funding will go towards....</div> <ul> <li>Compensating the dancers ($200-$600)</li> <li>Studio rentals (approx $250-$300)</li> <li>Costumes (approx $150)</li>

My compensation for showing this work will be exposure. I'm extremely grateful for this as I plan to continue choreographing, however, my day job does not provide me with enough money to fund this on my own. Contributions will first go towards studio rentals and costumes and any other money raised will go towards paying the dancers. If my goal is not reached, it is possible that the dancers will not be paid. Professional dancers, especially when they are starting out, often work hard for little to no compensation.

<p>Our artistic team began this journey in 2012 at The Wedge, Hangar Theatre’s innovative second stage in Ithaca, New York.  We experimented with unlocking Beckett’s classic text for a contemporary theatre-goer and need to share our production <i>Happy Days</i> with the savvy audiences of Washington DC!</p>
<p>Our production delves into what is particularly unique about this experience <i>today</i>. Our culture is obsessed with <i>things</i>.  Particularly <i>fast things</i>.  3G is quickly discarded for 4G is quickly discarded for 5G with fingerprint security.  We stand in line for hours for the newer faster thing. We are in a constant state of discarding things that are<br/>slow in order to #stayconnected!  Our production of <i>Happy Days </i>explores what happens to the things we discard -- and the people that remain connected to them.  </p>
<p>As our audiences enter CulturalDC’s Mead Theatre Lab in February 2014, they won’t be stepping into the proscenium stages of yesterday’s theatre, but literally into Winnie’s world as we convert the traditional theatre space into an art installation with your generous help.  </p>

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>We are not a theatre company.  We are a group of artists passionate about collaboration and making art.  Therefore, we are extremely fortunate to have been invited to present <i>Happy Days </i>as part of CulturalDC’s Mead Theatre Lab 2013-2014 season.  The Mead Theatre Lab is the first step to producing <i>Happy Days. </i>YOU are the second.</p>

<h2>The Play </h2>
<p><i>Happy Days </i>was written by Samuel Beckett in 1961.  It is the story of Winnie, a woman in her 50’s, buried to her waist in the earth.  Winnie dwells in a barren landscape under the hot sun with only her inattentive husband, Willie, to talk to. Although she is trapped, Winnie remains delightfully optimistic and passes “another happy day” futzing with beloved objects that keep her company…including a gun.  </p>
<p>Beckett’s plays are considered triumphs of the Theatre of the Absurd.  Martin Esslin, the scholar who coined the term “Theatre of the Absurd”, wrote that these plays:</p>
<p><i>“…explore the human subconscious in depth rather than trying to describe the outward appearance of human existence… [Theatre of the Absurd] aims to shock its audience out of complacency, to bring it face to face with the harsh facts of the human situation as these writers see it. But the challenge behind this message is anything but one of despair. It is the challenge to accept the human condition as it is, in all its mystery and absurdity…” </i></p>

Our artistic team began this journey in 2012 at The Wedge, Hangar Theatre’s innovative second stage in Ithaca, New York.  We experimented with unlocking Beckett’s classic text for a contemporary theatre-goer and need to share our production Happy Days with the savvy audiences of Washington DC!
Our production delves into what is particularly unique about this experience today. Our culture is obsessed with things.  Particularly fast things.  3G is quickly discarded for 4G is quickly discarded for 5G with fingerprint security.  We stand in line for hours for the newer faster thing. We are in a constant state of discarding things that areslow in order to #stayconnected!  Our production of Happy Days explores what happens to the things we discard -- and the people that remain connected to them.  
As our audiences enter CulturalDC’s Mead Theatre Lab in February 2014, they won’t be stepping into the proscenium stages of yesterday’s theatre, but literally into Winnie’s world as we convert the traditional theatre space into an art installation with your generous help.  


Who We Are
We are not a theatre company.  We are a group of artists passionate about collaboration and making art.  Therefore, we are extremely fortunate to have been invited to present Happy Days as part of CulturalDC’s Mead Theatre Lab 2013-2014 season.  The Mead Theatre Lab is the first step to producing Happy Days. YOU are the second.

<h3>Inspired By...</h3>
<p>Written as both play and screenplay by Robert Monegan, <strong>Defiantly Fabulous</strong> is a comedic and gay twist on the classic 1958 film, ""The Defiant Ones"". It starred Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier, about two escaped convicts, one white, one black, shackled together, hate each other, but must help each other, in order to survive and outrun the law. Great film, serious drama. Robert always wanted to do a gay version of the story. Not really a spoof, but semi same plot as original film, only comedic, catty, over the top, plenty of pop culture winks, set in the funky 1970s, and gay eye candy galore....so he wrote one. Originally Robert wrote it as a play, but after a chance meeting with SIDNEY POITIER, who suggested switching  it to a screenplay, Robert did as such.</p>
<h3>The Plot Thickens</h3>
<p><strong>Defiantly</strong> <strong>Fabulous </strong>- you are teased with a barrage of pop culture reminders of how life used to be. A throw-back to a simpler time, before cell phones, internet, and political correctness made everyone uptight, scared, and boring. The story centers around two men, their connection, and how they deal with it, all done up in a dare-to-go-there plot.</p>
<p>Set in the deep south of the 1970’s, two attractive convicts manage to escape from prison, and now are on the run from the Law.  Adding to the mix, one convict is black, the other is white, they are shackled together, and not too fond of one another (or so we think).  Oh, it should also be mentioned that both convicts are gay, and although one of them is closeted, and the other is “way out there”, neither of them have any trouble expressing their dislike for each other, with all the wit and fierceness you expect (and enjoy) in a gay farce.  However, the shackles the two share are a constant reminder of the connection they have, and the team work they must do in order to survive. Tempering their clashes (of sorts), the hunky duo keep a skip and jump distance from a redneck Sheriff and his side-kick Deputy, who are hot on their trail. As our runaway boys continue their flight through unknown wilderness and rural areas, they eventually stumble upon a lonely single mother and her quiet (but very cute) teenage son. It’s not long before we realize the mother hungers for a new life…and a new man to share it with.  She frees the two from their chains, only to find out that neither man wants to service her desires. Thus, our captivating convicts continue on the run, rid of their shackles, but now must face a much stronger connection they have….their true feelings for each other. In the end, one wonders what was the biggest crime these two men committed? Skipping prison or skipping their hearts?</p>
<h3>The Goal </h3>
<p>Producing two trial performances of the play, for further shopping of both play and screenplay versions to producers and industry. Performance dates: Fall 2012.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Needs and Perks</h3>
<p>Seeking additional funds for production budget. Amount: $2500. Money will go towards theatre/rehearsal space rental and tech crew. The cast are non Equity actor friends, who are volunteering their time and talent in exchange for copy and credit of production. Wardrobe, make-up, and hair are also contributed. Regardless of whether entire amount is raised or not, all funds will go towards this production.</p>
<p>Who doesn't need their own website...and a good one at that? In exchange to those who help with funding, web designer Mark Thaddeus Williams will offer affordable rates on his professional and prompt designing services. But that's not all! For all those divas out there (and we know who you are), artist Robert Monegan offers free gift packs of his sassy Glam Divas greeting cards, which feature fierce chicks, hot men, and tongue in cheek humor...no, not porn, just good clean bitchyness! T-shirts with <strong>Defiantly Fabulous</strong> logo (as shown in campaign image) also available. See ""perks"" section for details.  </p>
<h3>The Bigger Picture</h3>

<div>
<p>For the last five years, Robert Monegan and Mark Thaddeus Williams have created shows and events, with the help of a dedicated and talented team of technicians, actors, and stylists. <strong>Defiantly Fabulous</strong> is no different.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Virginia and my son loves to dance.  And we don't mean loves to move around - he loves dance.  From the age of 3 we knew Weston saw the world different, he felt it different and he heard it different.  We explored avenues to help him control his body movements and his ""energy"" as it was often called. (His nickname is Wind).  We decided to encourage it instead by enrolling him in his first ballet class.  At age 3 he took to the stage and fell in love!</p>
<p>At 7 years of age, he now has been asked to be part of 2 competition groups and does tap, jazz, ballet, hip hop, and musical theater.  And dance has changed his life.  However, competition and dance are a financial toll for our family.  The studio has been generous and given us a break, and we are doing trade deals for individual classes, but this will not get him to competitions.</p>
<p>We are asking for funding because we don't want his love of dance ever discouraged, and as a boy, BOY HAS IT EVER.  We've endured many a comment regarding the fact that he is a young boy in dance and he has too, but he truly doesn't care, he loves dance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for 5,000 dollars for two reasons, so we can pay the studio what they are worth!  The teachers at Ryan's American Dance have embraced Weston and have done so much for our family.  He spends every afternoon for numersous hours at the studio.  They are incredible teachers, dancers, and mentors.  Finally, the funds are so we can get him to at least 2 competitions this year and to a 6-week dance intensive program over the summer.  We started looking at options at Stanford but we shut it down when we saw the cost.  I want Weston to feel the support and love that a boy, at any age, can take on this sport and have the opportunity to share his passion.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact would be huge for Weston.  He would see the world pouring out support for a young boy dancer.   We have had many meetings with teachers, professionals, peditricians who have ""advised"" us about Weston's inability to focus, and I just smile because at age 6 my son did a 3 hour performance with 8 dances and 7 costume change all on his own (you see there isn't usually a lot of help backstage when you are the only boy and there are 50 girls to contend with).  The first performance, I wrung my hands worried sick what was going to happen, and he came on like a star and at the end of the night he said ""that was the best night of my life, this is what I want to do"".</p>

<h3>Requiem</h3>
<p>My name is John-Mark Owen. I am an independent ballet choreographer living and working in New York City. I have danced with several different ballet companies here and across America all with the goal in mind of making my own work when the time was right. I completed my graduate studies at NYU/Tisch School of the Arts a couple of years ago and have shown my choreography successfully since at venues including Jacob's Pillow Inside/Out Dance Festival, NYC's Ballet Builders, 92 St. Y/Harkness Dance Center, Symphony Space NYC, the Alvin Ailey Citigroup Theatre and Joe's Pub to name a few. Please visit johnmarkowen.com for further information.</p>
<p><strong>The Time Is Right</strong></p>
<p> <em><strong>Requiem </strong></em><strong></strong>is the result of 5 years of work and is quite personal. As a gay man, and a product of a community that does not accept homosexuality, mine has always been the search for truth in all aspects of living.</p>
<p> <strong></strong><em><strong>Requiem </strong></em><strong></strong>is an exploration of how masculinity is defined in societal terms. My aim is to encourage a dialogue around the societal archetype of men. This is because I see a continued regard of homosexual men as both “less than man” and “other.” Though homosexuals have gained societal recognition for many achievements over these past few years, there lingers a thought that homosexuality, among men, is less than masculine. Until that thought is dispelled, inequality will persist. By redefining societal archetypes, perhaps we can come to know that masculinity has more to do with courage of conviction than uber examples of stalwart strength. </p>
<p>It is my interest to combine the intensity and raw emotion of Dance Theatre with the melodic grace of balletic line. By imbuing balletic line with the immediacy, and unabashed exploration, of Dance Theatre I believe the intrinsic beauty of balletic line can be enhanced. To achieve this the body must become narrative. Sculptural shapes must be manipulated through transitions to build atmosphere and purpose. This leads to an experiential, essential, cinematic approach, which I believe has sustaining value. With this approach in mind I will create a work that centers on a narrative compelled by the musical score; where raw human experience is conveyed through the body as language. I will develop a working vocabulary that utilizes the classical principles of form and structure yet gives way to evocative imagery. With this vocabulary I will create a painterly world that captures the essence of narrative as opposed to literal narrative itself.</p>
<p><strong><em><br/></em>The Funding I Need</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong><strong>Requiem</strong> will premier at the Manhattan Movement and Arts Center Sept 13-15, 2012. The production requires a cast of 12 dancers. In addition to my dancer's salaries (compensation for 7 weeks of rehearsal and performances), I need to raise money to rent studio space, lighting design, costume design, stage management and various miscellaneous administrative expences. </p>
<p>Theatre-<strong> $7,200, </strong>Dancers- <strong>$30,000</strong> (12 @ $2,500 per),<strong> </strong>Lighting design- <strong>$2,500</strong>, Costume Design- <strong>$3,000</strong>, Stage management- <strong>$2,500</strong>, Studio Rental- <strong>$2,500, </strong>Marketing/Miscellaneous Admin- <strong>$5,000. </strong>I am quite fortunate that a majority of my development studio space has been granted to me as Artist-In-Residence in Newport, RI for two weeks this summer (<a href=""http://www.islandmovingco.org/?page_id=230"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.islandmovingco.org/?page_id=230</a>) as well as at the Silo (<a href=""http://silokirklandfarm.dancenownyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://silokirklandfarm.dancenownyc.org/</a>) where we can get a huge amount of work done towards <strong>Requiem.</strong> </p>
<p>Your generous contribution will not only go towards making <strong>Requiem </strong>a reality.

It is regulated by the adrenal glands and impacts the interpretation of our perceptions and thus influences our relationship to reality.  When the adrenal system creates a sense of trauma, we respond to reality in a traumatic manner.  In this way, the metabolic level of the body influences social relations between individuals and cultures.<br/><br/>Violence and drugs are some of the most common and potent causes of imbalances in the adrenal system, and they exist together in a perpetual shadow economy. The economy of weapons and narco-trafficking is a constant link between the USA and Colombia, and this commerce defines the relationship between the two countries. The adrenaline created by this business continually affects communities in both nations with devastating results.<br/><br/>Who is the god of adrenaline that fuels a path of mutual destruction?<br/>What are the pathways to readjust this systemic overdose of adrenaline?<br/>How do we address the continuing cycles of anger, trauma and ignorance?<br/>These are the questions that underlie the <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Dios de la Adrenalina</span> project.<br/><br/>The Carpetbag Brigade Physical Theater Company, directed by Jay Ruby (San Francisco, California) and Nemcatacoa Teatro, directed by Nicolas Cifuentes (Bogota, Colombia) are engaged in theatrical research around these themes. Together the companies use acrobatic stilt-walking, butoh dance, contact improvisation, and physical theater as a means of creating aesthetic, thought provoking street theater performances.<br/><br/>Verbo-bala (Tucson, Arizona) and Hojorasca (Carmen de Viborral, Colombia) are conducting the musical research for the project. Verbo-bala is a multi-media collective that will provide live music, video projections and bilingual spoken word narrative. Hojorasca is an experimental acoustic musical group evolving the art of traditional Andean music. The musical groups will each create their own scores and collaborate on mixed tracks for the project, as well as perform live with the performance.<br/>
</div><br/><font size=""4""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Project Origins &amp; History</span></font><br/><br/><div style=""text-align: justify;"">The Carpetbag Brigade and Nemcatacoa saw each anotherâ€™s work at the 2005 Al Aire Puro Festival in Bogota, Colombia.  In 2010, Jay Ruby and Nicolas Cifuentes worked together in The Carpetbag Brigadeâ€™s Stiltasana seminar in San Francisco, California.  During this time they recognized the common seeds in each otherâ€™s workâ€”influences of David Clarksonâ€™s Stalker Theatre, and the Odin Teatret.  Curiosity about the different aesthetics and trainings of their companies lead to a laboratory project proposal in which the companies would spend three weeks doing research together, sharing techniques of training, and composing creative material.  The companies were able to realize this laboratory in July and August of 2011 through self-raised funds on Kickstarter, the support of the US Embassy, the support of the El Gesto Noble Festival, Teatro Tespys, and La Casa de la Cultura del Carmen de Viboral.<br/>

We are confronting our selves as points of contact between the borders of different cultures and different histories to create a powerful experience that seeks to unveil the distance and distinctions between our countries and cultures. We want to create a tapestry of action that is a testimony to the impact of gun and drug induced adrenaline on the autonomic nervous system. We want to retrace the echoes of those collective and personal traumas in order to redress the ignorance and fear that exists as a wall between stereotyped images of one another and transform it into an atmosphere of respect and love through the sharing of public performance.<br/><br/>Our immediate goal for the winter of 2012 is to storyboard an early version of the performance so that we can present it at the Iberoamericano Festival in Bogota and use the success of that endeavor to create support and further opportunities for development and presentation.<br/>

De esta forma el nivel metabÃ³lico del cuerpo influencia las relaciones sociales entre individuos y culturas. La violencia y las drogas son de las causas mÃ¡s potentes y comunes de los desequilibrios del sistema adrenal, y juntos permanecen en una economÃ­a clandestina. La economÃ­a de trÃ¡fico de armas y el narcotrÃ¡fico existe como un vÃ­nculo constante entre los Estados Unidos y Colombia, y Ã©sta define la relaciÃ³n entre los dos paÃ­ses. La adrenalina creada por este comercio afecta continuamente comunidades en ambas naciones con resultados devastadores. Â¿QuiÃ©n es el dios de la adrenalina que impulsa un camino de destrucciÃ³n mutuo? Â¿CuÃ¡les son las formas para reajustar la sobredosis de adrenalina sistÃ©mica?

The Carpetbag Brigade Physical Theater Company from San Francisco, CA and Nemcatacoa Teatro from Bogota, Colombia, each specialize in creating live site-flexible street performances featuring the unique art of acrobatic stiltwalking. Verbo Bala is a VJ/DJ/Spoken word collective from Tucson, AZ and Hojarasca from Carmen de Viboral, Colombia is trio that composes contemporary music with traditional Andean instruments.In 2010 Carpetbag Brigade Director Jay Ruby and Nemcatacoa Director Nico Cifuentes began to plan a collaboration between their two companies. In 2011 the two companies spent three weeks together exchanging techniques and styles and discussing the issues that connected and divided their cultures. In 2012 the companies are invited to present a collaborative performance at the Iberoamericano Festival in Bogota, Colombia. To assist in creating the musical texture of the live performance the companies have invited Verbo Bala to work as DJ's and bilingual spoken word artists as well as Hojarasca to compose musical textures for the performance. 
""Dios de Adrenalina"" - A Poetic Thesis Of TraumaAdrenaline is the source of the fight or flight response in humans. It is regulated by the adrenal glands and impacts the interpretation of our perceptions and thus influences our relationship to reality.  When the adrenal system creates a sense of trauma, we respond to reality in a traumatic manner.  In this way, the metabolic level of the body influences social relations between individuals and cultures.Violence and drugs are some of the most common and potent causes of imbalances in the adrenal system, and they exist together in a perpetual shadow economy. The economy of weapons and narco-trafficking is a constant link between the USA and Colombia, and this commerce defines the relationship between the two countries. The adrenaline created by this business continually affects communities in both nations with devastating results.Who is the god of adrenaline that fuels a path of mutual destruction?What are the pathways to readjust this systemic overdose of adrenaline?How do we address the continuing cycles of anger, trauma and ignorance?These are the questions that underlie the Dios de la Adrenalina project.The Carpetbag Brigade Physical Theater Company, directed by Jay Ruby (San Francisco, California) and Nemcatacoa Teatro, directed by Nicolas Cifuentes (Bogota, Colombia) are engaged in theatrical research around these themes. Together the companies use acrobatic stilt-walking, butoh dance, contact improvisation, and physical theater as a means of creating aesthetic, thought provoking street theater performances.Verbo-bala (Tucson, Arizona) and Hojorasca (Carmen de Viborral, Colombia) are conducting the musical research for the project. Verbo-bala is a multi-media collective that will provide live music, video projections and bilingual spoken word narrative. Hojorasca is an experimental acoustic musical group evolving the art of traditional Andean music. The musical groups will each create their own scores and collaborate on mixed tracks for the project, as well as perform live with the performance.
Project Origins & HistoryThe Carpetbag Brigade and Nemcatacoa saw each anotherâ€™s work at the 2005 Al Aire Puro Festival in Bogota, Colombia.  In 2010, Jay Ruby and Nicolas Cifuentes worked together in The Carpetbag Brigadeâ€™s Stiltasana seminar in San Francisco, California.  During this time they recognized the common seeds in each otherâ€™s workâ€”influences of David Clarksonâ€™s Stalker Theatre, and the Odin Teatret.  Curiosity about the different aesthetics and trainings of their companies lead to a laboratory project proposal in which the companies would spend three weeks doing research together, sharing techniques of training, and composing creative material.  The companies were able to realize this laboratory in July and August of 2011 through self-raised funds on Kickstarter, the support of the US Embassy, the support of the El Gesto Noble Festival, Teatro Tespys, and La Casa de la Cultura del Carmen de Viboral.
Documentation of this process from Adam Cooper TerÃ¡n, video specialist, is available at the following links and a DVD can be sent if you wish for hard copy.Laboratory Week 1: http://vimeo.com/28726114Laboratory Week 2: http://vimeo.com/28728181Laboratory Week 3: http://vimeo.com/28744070The ImpactWe are examining the shadow economies of guns and drugs through the mediums of acrobatic stiltwalking, spoken word and music. We are confronting our selves as points of contact between the borders of different cultures and different histories to create a powerful experience that seeks to unveil the distance and distinctions between our countries and cultures. We want to create a tapestry of action that is a testimony to the impact of gun and drug induced adrenaline on the autonomic nervous system. We want to retrace the echoes of those collective and personal traumas in order to redress the ignorance and fear that exists as a wall between stereotyped images of one another and transform it into an atmosphere of respect and love through the sharing of public performance.Our immediate goal for the winter of 2012 is to storyboard an early version of the performance so that we can present it at the Iberoamericano Festival in Bogota and use the success of that endeavor to create support and further opportunities for development and presentation.
What We Need & What You GetOur Indie Go Go goal is $7777 by February 14th....We will be 18 people working together in a small village in Colombia.We are planning a cost effective research time from the beginning of February through the middle of March. To work as effectively as possible we need to raise $7777 by February 14th!This money will go towards assisting in travel costs to get all of us to Carmen de Viborral, to  pay for our shelter while we are there together and to assist in our production costs for costumes and props.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease help let people know about this project by putting it on your facebook wall, but signing up for our mass emails and by checking out our informational videos.___________________________________________________________________En Espanol
Nuestra historiaâ€œ Dios de la Adrenalina â€œ es un intercambio cultural y creaciÃ³n colectiva de teatro de calle enfocados en teatro fÃ­sico y acrobÃ¡tico en zancos y mÃºsica en vivo de 2 agrupaciones Norteamericanas y 2 agrupaciones Colombianas. Carpetbag Brigade Physical Theater Company (San Francisco â€“ USA) y FundaciÃ³n grupo artÃ­stico y cultural Nemcatacoa (BogotÃ¡- Col), ambas especializadas en crear espectÃ¡culos de teatro de calle con tÃ©cnicas de acrobacia en zancos. VerboÂ·bala es VJ/DJ/palabra hablada (Tucson â€“ USA) y Hojarasca (Carmen de Viboral â€“ Col) es un triÃ³ que compone mÃºsica contemporÃ¡nea con instrumentos andinos tradicionales.En el 2010 el director de Carpetbag â€“ Jay Ruby â€“ y el director de Nemcatacoa â€“ Nicolas Cifuentes â€“ comenzaron a planear una colaboraciÃ³n entre sus grupos. En 2011 ambos grupos pasaron juntos 3 semanas intercambiando tÃ©cnicas y estilos y discutiendo sobre los temas que unen y separan sus culturas. En 2012 los grupos estÃ¡n invitados a presentar su coproducciÃ³n en el Festival Iberoamericano de Teatro de BogotÃ¡, Colombia. Para asistir y crear las texturas musicales de la obra fueron invitados VerboÂ·bala y Hojarasca.â€œDios de la Adrenalina â€œ -- Tesis poÃ©tica del trauma â€“La adrenalina es el causante de la respuesta en el pelear o huir en los seres humanos. EstÃ¡ regulada por el sistema adrenal, lo cual afecta la interpretaciÃ³n de nuestras percepciones y asÃ­ influencia nuestra relaciÃ³n con la realidad. Cuando el sistema adrenal crea un sentido de trauma, es entonces cuando se responde a la realidad de una manera traumatizada. De esta forma el nivel metabÃ³lico del cuerpo influencia las relaciones sociales entre individuos y culturas. La violencia y las drogas son de las causas mÃ¡s potentes y comunes de los desequilibrios del sistema adrenal, y juntos permanecen en una economÃ­a clandestina. La economÃ­a de trÃ¡fico de armas y el narcotrÃ¡fico existe como un vÃ­nculo constante entre los Estados Unidos y Colombia, y Ã©sta define la relaciÃ³n entre los dos paÃ­ses. La adrenalina creada por este comercio afecta continuamente comunidades en ambas naciones con resultados devastadores. Â¿QuiÃ©n es el dios de la adrenalina que impulsa un camino de destrucciÃ³n mutuo? Â¿CuÃ¡les son las formas para reajustar la sobredosis de adrenalina sistÃ©mica? Â¿CÃ³mo podemos tratar los ciclos continuos de enojo, trauma, e ignorancia? Ã‰stas son las preguntas que sirven como punto de partida para el montaje Dios de la Adrenalina.Carpetbag Brigade (USA) y Nemcatacoa Teatro (Col) estÃ¡n comprometidas en una bÃºsqueda teatral acerca de estos temas. Usando acrobacia en zancos, danza butoh, danza de contacto o contact improvisation y teatro fÃ­sico como lenguaje para crear obras de teatro de calle. VerboÂ·bala (USA) y Hojarasca (Col) estÃ¡n encargados de dirigir la bÃºsqueda musical del proyecto.VerboÂ·bala es un colectivo que mezcla mÃºsica en vivo, video proyecciones y narrativa verbal. Hojarasca es un grupo acÃºstico experimental evolucionando sobre la mÃºsica andina tradicional.Los grupos compondrÃ¡n piezas para la obra y crearan conjuntamente otras para el proyecto ademÃ¡s de tocar en vivo para las funciones.Proyecto: OrÃ­genes e HistoriaEn el Festival al Aire Puro (BogotÃ¡) del aÃ±o 2005 ambos grupos de teatro presenciaron el trabajo escÃ©nico en zancos de cada uno. En 2010 los directores Jay Ruby y NicolÃ¡s Cifuentes trabajaron en el seminario Stiltasana de Carpetbag Brigade en San Francisco, California. AllÃ­ reconocieron las raÃ­ces comunes de su trabajo y las influencias de David Clarkson y el OdÃ­n Theater. El interÃ©s suscitado en los diferentes entrenamientos y la afinidad en la bÃºsqueda estÃ©tica de ambas compaÃ±Ã­as resultÃ³ en una propuesta de creaciÃ³n colectiva que comenzarÃ­a con un laboratorio teatral donde los grupos durante 3 semanas harÃ­an una investigaciÃ³n en zancos, compartirÃ­an tÃ©cnicas de entrenamiento y compondrÃ­an material escÃ©nico. Los grupos realizaron este laboratorio en Julio y Agosto de 2011 con fondos autos gestionados en Kickstarter.com, ademÃ¡s de apoyos de la Embajada de USA en Colombia, el Festival Gesto Noble, Teatro Tespys y la Casa de la Cultura del Carmen de Viboral (Antioquia- Col.).La documentaciÃ³n acerca de esto estÃ¡ en estos videos de Adam Cooper de VerboÂ·bala.Laboratory Week 1: http://vimeo.com/28726114Laboratory Week 2: http://vimeo.com/28728181Laboratory Week 3: http://vimeo.com/28744070El impactoNosotros estamos examinando la economÃ­a clandestina de trÃ¡fico de armas y drogas a travÃ©s de medios como acrobacia en zancos y mÃºsica.

</div></div>","THE HISTORY 

In August of last year we received a generous space donation and began developing a devised work in response to the loss of indie theater spaces in the New York downtown scene. Our team began working with the historically infamous Bowery Poetry Club to create a fun and vital performance to reinvigorate bare bones theater in a way that incorporates and builds the audience into the show itself.
The creative team that has been assembled are some of the most passionate downtown up and coming artists. We have developed dance numbers, written new music, created thrilling acts all in the style of a late 1920's Weimar underground Cabaret. 
Now, after a nearly sold out 2 nights in November we've been invited 
back to present the next stage of development: more acts, more booze, an even sexier, bloodier, Eschaton.
Part of the stipulation of this project has always been to produce this show on an affordable budget. Miraculously, we did this for $100 the first time around. We've had incredible luck with generous gifts in kind from the Bowery Poetry Club and MTWorks. 
(I've personally hand sewn/made 3 tu-tu's from found material. Daniel Irizarry donated his strength to help me haul donated fabric materials all the way from Queens.)

We've cobbled together resources and raised funds with the last two performances but still have a tiny ways to go to support this developing project.

Here's what your support (in any amount) can help us do:

$7 pays for one script to be copied ( we are printing 18)

$15 pays for 1 hour of rehearsal space (a typical production of this size with music, dance and numerous acts rehearses for 40 hours)
$20 pays one artists stipend ( there are 11 total performers, 5 writers, a stage manager and 2 directors)

</div></div>","Our Story
In 1887 Lloyd Osbourne approached his step-father Robert Louis Stevenson with a draft of a comic novel, asking for advice.  Stevenson enjoyed the novel and agreed to collaborate on it, and in 1889 they came out with a delightful black comedy, The Wrong Box.  When Rudyard Kipling read the book, he wrote:  
I have got R.L. Stevenson's [The Wrong Box] and laughed over it dementedly when I read it.
 
After reading “The Wrong Box” and laughing as much as Rudyard Kipling, I thought it had to be brought to the stage.  One of RLS’s lesser-known works, the story is rich and exciting and the characters the sort of delightful, scheming antiheroes one can root for and against at the same time.  And their passions are so big, it simply cried out for musicalization.
 
Luckily, musicals are what I write.  I worked like crazy for months writing an adaptation of The Wrong Box, which went on to be produced at Union College in Schenectady, NY in 2002.  Audiences laughed and laughed.  Later, in 2006, selections were performed at the Golden Fleece Composers Chamber Theatre in NYC, and now – much later and after years of revising, perfecting, and generally still loving to work on this project - I have decided to make a studio recording.

SYNOPSIS
A mysterious corpse is knocking about Victorian England, and two unscrupulous cousins are desperately trying to find it – except when they’re desperately trying to lose it!  If the corpse in the train wreck turns out to be Uncle Joseph then Cousin Michael wins the family inheritance, unless Cousin Morris can dispose of the body first.  From pillar to post, from packing-case to piano, the hapless heirs scramble to keep up with the vanishing cadaver in this musical adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson’s classic farce.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are ""Teman Hutan""...a travelling troupe of actors performing for communities in the heart of Borneo.  ""Teman Hutan"" is Indonesian, but in English translates to ""Friends of the Forest"", and that is exactly what we are...friends of the forest.  Our performance illustrates the negative effects of deforestation while promoting alternative sustainable livelihoods for the indigenous Dayak people.  Our performance also highlights the needs of endangered animals, such as the orangutan, demonstrating why it is better for them to live in the wild as opposed to being kept in captivity or sold into the illegal animal trade.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is to provide sustainable income options for the Dayak people, empowering them to live independently.  If successful, the they will no longer be forced to sell their land to unscrupulous companies to put food on their tables.  They will no longer feel the only option to make a living is to work on gold mines under horrible conditions that poison their bodies as well as the river so many depend on.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The sustainable alternative we illustrate in our performance is the Sugar Palm.  This tree only grows in a  healthy, bio-diverse jungle...not in the deforested, mono-culture plantations the Oil Palm needs to thrive.  The Sugar Palm tree can provide electricity for an entire village, as well as fuel for cooking.  Families are able to collect sugar from the juice of the Sugar Palm, and sell this sugar to a world-wide market through an already existing cooperative.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We also aim to positively impact endangered animals such as orangutans, sun bears, and gibbons.  During our travels we will come across many of these animals in unhealthy situations.  Our performance shows the benefits these animals have on the health of the forest, when they are able to live freely, and will hopefully lead to their release.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are also part of a global project titled DeforestACTION.  There are other teams working working with us within DeforestACTION to bring captive animals to animals rescue centers where the animals will be rehabilitated and released back into the wild.  There is also a team that will pass out Sugar Palm seedlings to villages that have shown interest in growing their own Sugar Palms.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Are Fundraising For</h3>
<p>In order to make truly moving, and educational presentations, there are some things we need.  Most importantly is the travel expense to get to Borneo, as well as travel expenses once we are there.  We will have to pay for many river trips to get to the remote villages in the jungle, and we'll need to pay for the fuel to get there as well.  Food and lodging is also of high importance.  If we are able to get enough funding, having a satellite phone and a gps system would be a great comfort in terms of safety and the possibility of getting lost in the jungle!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There are also items needed for the actual performance.  These include mobile speakers, basic costume pieces, various props, high quality durable drama masks, a projector, projector screen, and a mobile power source for performing in villages without electricity.  We will also be leaving educational materials and pamphlets with the communities we perform in, so printing costs will be a part of what we are fundraising for as well.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal of $6,000 dollars, we will do our best with the amount that has been raised.</p>

<h3>Daisy's Madhouse is a non-profit fringe theater in Boise. Its mission is to 
produce bold, innovative and quality theater, which aims:<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<span class=""textstyle0"">
</span><ul>
<li><span class=""textstyle0"">
To diversify and expand the audience for theater in the Treasure Valley by 
actively reaching out to younger audiences, cultivating the next generation 
of theatre goers.</span></li>
<li><span class=""textstyle0"">To develop theater artists by providing new opportunities for performance 
and artistic exploration.</span></li>
<li><span class=""textstyle0"">
To champion a broad and diverse base of local art and artists. We intend 
for our theatre to be a physical and creative intersection for community and 
art in Boise. Our productions often challenge traditional theatrical forms and 
conventions, incorporating music, dance, performance art and/or digital 
media.</span></li>
<li><span class=""textstyle0"">To enrich the Treasure Valley community by producing the Will Act 4 
Food Festival to raise funds for the Idaho Food Bank.</span></li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<p>By donating to Daisy's Madhouse fall campaign you are ensuring the ongoing success of daring theatre that has meaning in the Treasure Valley.  This Fall we are, ambitiously, producing two wonderful works for the Stage.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Laramie Project: 10 years later. </span></span><span class=""textstyle0"">On October 6th of 1998 Matthew Shepard was beaten and left to die tied to a fence in the outskirts of 
Laramie, Wyoming. He died six days later. His murder became a watershed historical moment in America 
that highlighted the violence and prejudice lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people face. A 
month after the murder, the members of Tectonic Theater Project traveled to Laramie and conducted 
interviews with the people of the town. From these interviews they wrote the play The Laramie Project, 
which they later made into a film for HBO. One of the most performed plays of the last decade, the piece 
has been seen by more than 50 million people around the country.<br/><br/>
The Laramie Project - 10 Years Later is the sequel to this play. The epilogue focuses on the long-term 
effect of the murder of Matthew Shepard on the town of Laramie. It explores how the town has changed 
and how the murder continues to reverberate in the community. The play also includes new interviews 
with Matthew's mother Judy Shepard and Mathew's murderer Aaron McKinney, who's serving dual life 
sentences, as well as follow-up interviews with many of the individuals from the original piece. <br/></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Evil Dead: the Musical!</span></span>  The ""disarmingly"" funny musical adaptation of the cult classic films that starred Bruce Campbell, and launched Sam Raimi's directing career. Evil Dead: the Musical t<span class=""textstyle0"">ells the tale of 5 college kids who 
travel to a cabin in the woods and accidentally unleash an evil force. And although it may sound like a 
horror, it's not! The songs are hilariously campy and the show is bursting with more farce than a Monty 
Python skit. Evil Dead: The Musical unearths the old familiar story: boy and friends take a weekend 
getaway at abandoned cabin, boy expects to get lucky, boy unleashes ancient evil spirit, friends turn into 
Candarian Demons, boy fights until dawn to survive. As musical mayhem descends upon this sleepover in 
the woods, ""camp"" takes on a whole new meaning with uproarious numbers like ""All the Men in my Life 
Keep Getting Killed by Candarian Demons,"" ""Look Who's Evil Now"" and ""Do the Necronomicon.""</span></p>

Its mission is to 
produce bold, innovative and quality theater, which aims:






To diversify and expand the audience for theater in the Treasure Valley by 
actively reaching out to younger audiences, cultivating the next generation 
of theatre goers.
To develop theater artists by providing new opportunities for performance 
and artistic exploration.

To champion a broad and diverse base of local art and artists. We intend 
for our theatre to be a physical and creative intersection for community and 
art in Boise. Our productions often challenge traditional theatrical forms and 
conventions, incorporating music, dance, performance art and/or digital 
media.
To enrich the Treasure Valley community by producing the Will Act 4 
Food Festival to raise funds for the Idaho Food Bank.



By donating to Daisy's Madhouse fall campaign you are ensuring the ongoing success of daring theatre that has meaning in the Treasure Valley.  This Fall we are, ambitiously, producing two wonderful works for the Stage.  

The Laramie Project: 10 years later. On October 6th of 1998 Matthew Shepard was beaten and left to die tied to a fence in the outskirts of 
Laramie, Wyoming. He died six days later. His murder became a watershed historical moment in America 
that highlighted the violence and prejudice lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people face. A 
month after the murder, the members of Tectonic Theater Project traveled to Laramie and conducted 
interviews with the people of the town. From these interviews they wrote the play The Laramie Project, 
which they later made into a film for HBO. One of the most performed plays of the last decade, the piece 
has been seen by more than 50 million people around the country.
The Laramie Project - 10 Years Later is the sequel to this play. The epilogue focuses on the long-term 
effect of the murder of Matthew Shepard on the town of Laramie. It explores how the town has changed 
and how the murder continues to reverberate in the community. The play also includes new interviews 
with Matthew's mother Judy Shepard and Mathew's murderer Aaron McKinney, who's serving dual life 
sentences, as well as follow-up interviews with many of the individuals from the original piece. 

Evil Dead: the Musical!  The ""disarmingly"" funny musical adaptation of the cult classic films that starred Bruce Campbell, and launched Sam Raimi's directing career. Evil Dead: the Musical tells the tale of 5 college kids who 
travel to a cabin in the woods and accidentally unleash an evil force. And although it may sound like a 
horror, it's not! The songs are hilariously campy and the show is bursting with more farce than a Monty 
Python skit. Evil Dead: The Musical unearths the old familiar story: boy and friends take a weekend 
getaway at abandoned cabin, boy expects to get lucky, boy unleashes ancient evil spirit, friends turn into 
Candarian Demons, boy fights until dawn to survive. As musical mayhem descends upon this sleepover in 
the woods, ""camp"" takes on a whole new meaning with uproarious numbers like ""All the Men in my Life 
Keep Getting Killed by Candarian Demons,"" ""Look Who's Evil Now"" and ""Do the Necronomicon.""

<h3>Spreading Light</h3>
<p>Theatre is a powerful commodity. It can entertain, provide escape, lift our spirits, and at times enlighten. It can, we believe, make a difference. This is our goal with FACING EAST. </p>
<p>I saw the play, FACING EAST, in San Francisco a few years ago with it's original cast, and was moved to tears. I was in San Francisco working on another musical, and had been looking for a new project. I wanted to create something that could entertain, move, and create dialogue. I wanted to change the world! Ambitious, perhaps. But in FACING EAST I saw the potential to make that dream a reality. </p>
<p>The story was simple. A Mormon couple at the funeral of their son (who had committed suicide because of internal conflicts he faced between his sexual orientation and his deep religious beliefs) meet his lover. Conflict turns to a desperate need for understanding. </p>
<p>I reached out to the playwright, Carol Lynn Pearson, who happened to live nearby in the Bay Area. After meeting her, and explaining that I wanted to adapt FACING EAST into a musical (a MUSICAL!), she balked. She expected something along the lines of THE BOOK OF MORMON, I think. But as I explained my vision: an intimate, almost chamber-style folk musical that would not chastise religion, but encourage dialogue. A piece that simply asks for open minds, and acceptance, in a time when suicide among the young LGBT community is far too common. </p>
<p>Happilly, she gave her blessing. We've been lucky to have Mark-Eugene Garcia, and David Rigano aboard as our writers, who have crafted a piece that brings every emotion possible to the surface. Our director, Andrew Hobgood, is a rising star in the Chicago theatre industry. Our producing team features ambitious talents from across North America, and even Australia! </p>
<p>Following an initial workshop reading in Chicago, we now move forward with plans to present a concert/workshop of the show in the Dallas area this July, prior to a full production next season!</p>
<p>We are thrilled to also announce that the concert will feature the talents of JULIE JOHNSON as Ruth, (National Tour of MEMPHIS, Broadway production of CANDIDE, Baby Bop from TV's BARNIE), and MAX SWARNER as Marcus (rising star in the Texas theatrical industry).</p>
<p>Profits from the box office of this concert will go to a local LGBT charity in Dallas. It is very important to us that this be the musical that truly gives back. Our hope is that through this concert, we'll build the momentum we need to mount the show's first fully staged production next season.</p>
<p>I hope that you will join us on this journey. Developing a musical is not easy, but together we can create something truly special. One step at a time.</p>

<p><em>The Corpse Bride </em>was a huge success in its workshop production at Toronto’s Young Centre in 2010.  The challenge?  It’s big.  We proudly employ fourteen actors, three designers, four live musicians, and one composer in a pear tree.  Just kidding. </p>
<p>Now we need only $6,500 to get it to the Ashkenaz Festival, North America’s largest festival of Yiddish and Jewish culture. </p>
<p><strong>GREAT NEWS:  Our association with the Ashekenaz Festival enables us to offer tax receipts!! </strong><em>(Please enter your full name and address on the payment page so we can send you the tax receipt.)</em></p>
<p><em>The Corpse Bride </em>is about a young groom who accidentally weds himself to a dead bride in this darkly comedic spin on Jewish folklore.  A daring piece of movement theatre, done in the style of silent film, full of eerie theatrical images and colourful Yiddish characters.</p>
<p>We have gathered a team of artists that includes genuine Canadian icon and former prima ballerina Evelyn Hart, as well as wonderful theatre practitioners such as Sarah Orenstein, Richard Greenblatt, William Vickers, Kevin Lamotte, Teresa Przylbylski, and John Gzowski.</p>

</div></div>","The Corpse Bride was a huge success in its workshop production at Toronto’s Young Centre in 2010.  The challenge?  It’s big.  We proudly employ fourteen actors, three designers, four live musicians, and one composer in a pear tree.  Just kidding. 
Now we need only $6,500 to get it to the Ashkenaz Festival, North America’s largest festival of Yiddish and Jewish culture. 
GREAT NEWS:  Our association with the Ashekenaz Festival enables us to offer tax receipts!! (Please enter your full name and address on the payment page so we can send you the tax receipt.)
The Corpse Bride is about a young groom who accidentally weds himself to a dead bride in this darkly comedic spin on Jewish folklore.  A daring piece of movement theatre, done in the style of silent film, full of eerie theatrical images and colourful Yiddish characters.
We have gathered a team of artists that includes genuine Canadian icon and former prima ballerina Evelyn Hart, as well as wonderful theatre practitioners such as Sarah Orenstein, Richard Greenblatt, William Vickers, Kevin Lamotte, Teresa Przylbylski, and John Gzowski.

<p>This spring we are excited to be putting on a production of Stephen Schwartz's <em>Godspell.</em></p>
<p>Auditions were open to all of NYUs undergraduate schools and an extremely talented and hardworking cast was assembled with actors majoring in everything from Math and Psychology to Dance and Vocal Studies. For many of our performers, C.A.S.T. provides a way to continue to be involved in something they love as an extracurricular activity,while others use CAST's shows to build their performance resumes as they pursue careers on stage and screen.  In fact, two Godspell cast members just recently won roles in professional shows that will be touring this summer. We are thrilled to be working with such a talented and diverse group!</p>
<p>But CAST is facing a challenge this year.</p>
<p>Our home theater space at NYU recently went under construction, leaving us without an assigned performance venue for the first time in club history.</p>
<p>We're flexible and don't mind practicing in empty classrooms and dorm study lounges - but the actual show needs to be in a theater!</p>
