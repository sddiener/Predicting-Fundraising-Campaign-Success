<p class=""Body"">Coral reefs around the world are disappearing at an alarming rate.  That’s a big problem, because coral reefs are the rainforests of the oceans.  Although coral reefs cover only 0.1% of the ocean surface, they are homes to approximately one quarter (25%) of all sea life!  So if there are no more coral reefs, the entire marine ecosystem will be severely affected. </p>
<p class=""Body"">The thing is, the major reasons coral reefs are dying--things like global warming and ocean acidification--seem to be such huge and insurmountable problems that most people get overwhelmed and give up.  But you know who doesn’t think like that?  Our young people!  Today’s children and youth are more aware of global environmental issues than any previous generation, and they still have the energy, the enthusiasm, and the sincere belief that they can do something to fix the problems.  As connected and networked as they all are, adolescents know that even small actions can have a giant impact--as long as you get thousands or millions of people to work together. </p>
<p class=""Body"">Healing Oceans Together is one youth organization with that kind of vision.  We are young teens (and our families) who want to engage our peers around the world in working together to save our oceans.  So we thought, what could we do to reach the whole world with our message?  What can we do differently to inspire other kids to change their behavior for the benefit of the oceans when there is already a ton of information out there on this issue? </p>
<p class=""Body"">Then we had a brainstorm.  What do kids really love to do?  They love to PLAY GAMES!  What if we made saving the oceans into a game? </p>
<p class=""Body""><strong>We planned for the rules of the game to model mathematics and science of an ecosystem. The artwork itself will use crochet, origami and other mathematically rich media to model surfaces and shapes. This invites students developing or playing the game to engage with many types of modeling and design.</strong></p>
<p class=""Body"">So here is our idea in more detail.  We want to make a trading card game like... well, we won’t mention the name because we don’t want get into copyright infringement, but it rhymes with “smokeynon.”  Our cards will have points and powers and fun stuff like that, but it will be based on REAL marine life and the ways they actually win or lose in the game of Survivor played in the oceans every day!  And part of the game will include the things we do as individuals that effect the ocean in either a positive or negative way.  So you’ll get negative points for leaving the lights on all night while you are asleep or driving someplace that you could walk to, or positive points for planting a vegetable garden or for choosing a homemade lunch over going out for a fast food meal. </p>
<p class=""Body""><a href=""http://healingoceanstogether.wordpress.com/donate-2/456-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>We have an opportunity to work with many excellent professional science and math educators and game designers, so we already have some ideas about how the game will look and play - check them out!</strong></a>  And here is the next radical part of our plan.  We want to have the largest possible impact, right?  So we want thousands or millions of people to be playing our game all over the world.  Therefore, we are committed to designing our game and our cards under a Creative Commons license and to making them available for anyone to download for FREE!   Free is always good, right?  Free is the way we think we can make the largest possible difference.</p>
<p class=""Body"">So here is what we’ve got in place:</p>

<li class=""Body"">a group of highly committed young teens, with support from their families</li>
<li class=""Body"">a history of successful kid-friendly environmental awareness projects, including our Recycled Gifts Fair, our Great Sea Slug Beauty Contest, and our Craft Coral Reef (see our website at <a href=""http://healingoceanstogether.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://healingoceanstogether.wordpress.com</a>/ for more information on these projects)</li>
<li class=""Body"">a network of supporters around the world</li>
<li class=""Body"">access to large numbers of peers and collaborators, ranging in age from preschooler through teenagers, who will help us to test and fine tune our game</li>
<li class=""Body"">connections with a university research program that will assist with our game development and distribution</li>
<li class=""Body"">connections with professional scientists, mathematicians, artists, and game developers who will assist us in making the game fun, meaningful, and beautiful</li>
</ul><p class=""Body""> </p>
<p class=""Body"">We are willing to do all the game development work out of our own resources.  But here is where we need your financial support.  For this game to work, the science has got to be right.  We need to go and work with professional marine biologists to understand the intricate relationships between the different components of the coral reef ecosystem.  We need to go and observe coral reef life in action so that we can depict it realistically in  our game. </p>
<p class=""Body"">We have an opportunity to do that by spending a week with coral reef researchers at VIERS--the Virgin Islands Environmental Research Station in Saint John’s Island in the Caribbean.  We will be studying with professional marine biologists and observing and capturing the images of the marine life to include in our game. </p>
<p class=""Body"">So it is going to be really cool.  But don’t think we’re trying to get you to fund our vacation at a fancy resort.  VIERS is a working research facility set in a primitive location.  There’s no air conditioning, no warm showers, no WiFi and video games, no swimming pool and tiki bar.  It will just be us with the scientists, the natural environment, and the inhabitants of the coral reef. </p>
<p class=""Body"">So, actually, we’re doing you a favor.  We’ll do all the sweating, hard work, and avoiding biting bugs and stinging jellyfish to bring <strong>you</strong> the world of the coral reefs on cards that you can play in the luxury of your own home, school, or workplace.  And playing the game promises to give you:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""Body"">
<strong>FUN</strong> (we all need more fun in our lives, don’t we?)</li>
<li class=""Body"">
<strong>ENLIGHTENMENT</strong> (who knew all these tiny invertebrates would be so fascinating?)</li>
<li class=""Body"">
<strong>MODELING</strong> (one of the key math and science literacies of our era)</li>

<li class=""Body""><strong>HEALTHIER OCEAN ENVIRONMENTS</strong></li>
</ul><p class=""Body""> </p>
<p class=""Body"">So please support our game development effort.  Maybe you can’t fly, or don’t have X-ray vision or extraordinary strength.  But if you help our efforts to find a fun way to save the vital ecology of the coral reefs, you’ll be a Super Hero to us... and to the other children who want the coral reefs to still be around by the time they are adults. </p>
<p class=""Body"">And, of course, you’ll get cool Perks!  Check them out on the right hand side of the page.   Check out the photo gallery for samples of the crochet pieces that are part of our craft coral reef, and what you could receive as one of our perks!   If you would like to donate your perk to someone that would love to have it, we are willing to find just the right family to donate it to, and give you all the credit, of course.</p></div>","Help us turn environmental activism into a game that kids will love to play, while learning about marine life and tangible things they can do to save our global oceans.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>       $5,000 will cover the cost testing a new prototype and making a video showing that recycling at the point of collection in relatively small amounts is an easy, viable and cost-effective alternative to supplement existing practices,  Ms. Blanco has been founding the project to conduct preliminary activities, prototypes and beta testing. But, additional resources are needed until sufficient recycled material is produced to sustain the operation. Should our funding goals fall short, funds received will be used towards producing a community education booklet targeted to schoolchildren on how recycling helps maintain a healthy environment. <br/></p>
<p>      To show how grateful we are for your participation in this noble cause, we offer unique perks at various levels:  $1,000- reading pad; $500- 8GB flash disk; $100- home made ""Baklava"" box; $50- carrying tote with recycle logo $20- your name plus names of other contributors in a large frame and prominently displayed at the Collection/Accumulation center, plus a thank you card. Our success will be due to the good folks who pass along this campaign 
to their friends and contacts. If you like what you see and decide to 
participate, just select the contribution that best suits you.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>     As always, we ask that you help us to spread the news in any way you can, by e-mail, social media or some good old gossip. Using the e-mail feature in the main page makes it real easy to send to friends. And don't forget to check on us regularly; we are updating our progress on a weekly basis. <br/>    Remember, to preserve the environment and decrease plastic waste, send this notice to your contacts with similar ideas. Most people are interested in protecting the environment, but do not know how. It is easy: <br/><br/>                   <span style=""color: rgb(0, 102, 0);""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(204, 0, 0);""><span style=""color: rgb(0, 102, 0);"">REMOVE LABELS AND/OR CAP FROM PLASTIC CONTAINERS BEFORE DISPOSAL</span>. </span><br/><br/>    Again, thanks for your support!<br/>

       $5,000 will cover the cost testing a new prototype and making a video showing that recycling at the point of collection in relatively small amounts is an easy, viable and cost-effective alternative to supplement existing practices,  Ms. Blanco has been founding the project to conduct preliminary activities, prototypes and beta testing. But, additional resources are needed until sufficient recycled material is produced to sustain the operation. Should our funding goals fall short, funds received will be used towards producing a community education booklet targeted to schoolchildren on how recycling helps maintain a healthy environment. 
      To show how grateful we are for your participation in this noble cause, we offer unique perks at various levels:  $1,000- reading pad; $500- 8GB flash disk; $100- home made ""Baklava"" box; $50- carrying tote with recycle logo $20- your name plus names of other contributors in a large frame and prominently displayed at the Collection/Accumulation center, plus a thank you card. Our success will be due to the good folks who pass along this campaign 
to their friends and contacts. If you like what you see and decide to 
participate, just select the contribution that best suits you.

Other Ways You Can Help     As always, we ask that you help us to spread the news in any way you can, by e-mail, social media or some good old gossip. Using the e-mail feature in the main page makes it real easy to send to friends. And don't forget to check on us regularly; we are updating our progress on a weekly basis.     Remember, to preserve the environment and decrease plastic waste, send this notice to your contacts with similar ideas. Most people are interested in protecting the environment, but do not know how. It is easy:                     REMOVE LABELS AND/OR CAP FROM PLASTIC CONTAINERS BEFORE DISPOSAL.     Again, thanks for your support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Anisha, Mario, and a whole lot of poop.</b></p>
<p>Ever had diarrhea? Ugh,
right? The stomach cramps, the sweating, the fever, the discomfort. Hopefully,
you were able to cure the diarrhea and avoid repeat episodes. Not everyone is
so fortunate, however. Nearly 400,000 children in India under the age of 5,
most from poor families, die each year from diarrhea-related illness. </p>
<p>Everyone agrees that
fecal-oral transmission is the main culprit. That is, feces makes its way into food
and water, and from there, into the body. Now there are many ways for this to
happen. But we at Tansa Clean are interested in a specific one – the way in
which huge amounts of human feces are dumped into freshwater sources close to
urban areas. </p>
<p>About 40% of urban homes
in India aren’t connected to the sewer system. These homes call in vacuum trucks
to empty their septic tanks. But Indian municipalities simply aren’t big enough
to process the material from these unsewered homes. So once they’ve serviced
the tank, truck operators frequently drive to the most convenient drop-off
point, which is often the closest river. </p>
<p>Now the river starts to
die as it sickens people around it. Lost work days and the cost of medical
treatment means that the Indian economy loses an estimated $120 million
annually. And nearly 70 of India’s rivers have such low levels of dissolved
oxygen thanks to fecal pollution that they are unable to support aquatic life. </p>
<p>But Tansa Clean
has a solution. Because if handled right, poop can be transformed into clean,
highly renewable energy, and nutrient-rich, pathogen-free compost.</p>
<p>To do this, you need an
anaerobic biodigester - a very cool technology - that uses bacterial action to
break down organic wastes into methane and compost in the absence of oxygen.
Fortunately for us, India has a large and growing number of them. So we’re connecting
vacuum trucks with biodigesters. Once a truck has completed servicing a septic
tank, we send it to the closest municipal or private biodigester to offload.
The biodigester takes this organic waste and does its microbial magic. Meanwhile
we pay the truck driver for each delivery. Our system will keep thousands of
cubic meters of septic tank waste out of rivers leaving them a little cleaner.  </p>
<p>Simple, elegant, impactful.</p>
<p><b>We’re starting small (but dreaming big)…and we’ve got such cool
perks!</b></p>
<p>A great idea! But it isn’t any good until we can test it, break
it, fix it, refine it, and grow it. And we can do this…with your support. We’re
partnering with a biodigester operator in the state of Maharashtra in India to
test the system. We’ll create a small network of vacuum truck operators in the
closest big city and they will make deliveries to the digester. We’ll trial this
delivery system; measure what’s going in and what’s coming out; test for harmful
pathogens; analyze the makeup and volume of methane; and see what farmers think of
the compost. </p>
<p>With the money we raise through this campaign, we’ll run this
system for atleast one quarter. Then, we’ll grow our customer base, the network
of trucks, and our impact. </p>
<p>As thanks for your support and generosity, we’ve developed and
sourced some great perks. </p>

<p>We are ""Positive
Steps"", a registered, ""grass roots"" NGO that works hard at reducing poor human socio-economic status and ultra-poverty of rural Malawian communities. The name reflects our approach to critical human development issues - one step at a time, always forward. This project is about leveraging significant institutional finance to enable a unique sustainable development model and build financially
viable social enterprises within 7 Malawian rural communities.</p>
<p>With a population of 15 million, only 8.9% of Malawians have access to electricity. Almost no rural
community has access to grid electricity. When the sun sets, people have to use
kerosene lamps, torches and candles, grass, firewood; most rural households
cook wood fire that spews toxic smoke; schools have no light, no electricity
for internet or computers; our children’s ability to learn is affected by the
lack of light for studying and fail to achieve their full potential in
education; our clinics cannot operate effectively and safely, small business
cannot grow and realize their full potential because of lack of access to
electricity; it takes rural dwellers half a day to walk to the nearest town to
charge their phone for a fee and in some cases it may even take a whole day;
there is no easy access to clean water. Most villagers walk miles to the
nearest river, lake or well to fetch water in a can or queue at the borehole
for more than 6 hours to only get a bucket of 20 litres or less. Often this
water is contaminated with harmful pathogens. These contaminants cause serious
illness, long-term suffering and even death. Our children are particularly
vulnerable and often die. These social trends if not addressed continue to
accelerate ultra-poverty levels for rural Malawians.</p>
<p>In our effort to
reduce the above-mentioned social trend and create a sustainable model for scaling
up to serve the whole country on future, Positive Steps has developed a project
called ""Green Rural Alternative Sustainable Energy Project (GRASP)”. The
concept has been proposed to and been well received by Malawian banks,
International NGOs and private investors - in principle we have access to
funding our first communities. We are to prepare a full proposal for installation
of clean and sustainable energy and water in seven (7) sites during 2014 and need
to design the Project Document. To do this we need two things: </p>
<p>1. 
To carry out baseline surveys, consultation and community sensitisation at the target sites</p>
<p>2.  A capable technology partner whose vision is aligned with ours</p>
<p>We have partnered with
RVE.SOL Ltd who manufactures the KUDURA sustainable development solution –
essentially clean, renewable energy and water in a single box.</p>
<p>For the purposes of
the fieldwork and project prep and as our own resources are limited we have created this campaign.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p><p></p>
<p>The total project cost
for the field work and creating the project document is estimated at €7,769. This
in turn will leverage commercial and private institutional funding estimated at
€150,000 per community. We have a high belief that our funding will be approved on the basis of pre-work that has been done.</p>
<p>We have raised 48% from
our local resources and through local promises to pay. We are looking to raise the
remainder of  €4,000 which will enable
this project to materialize.</p>

<p>- 
purchase
two second hand computers for data processing and prep in our offices</p><p>We are contributing the cost of man-power of the project team (4 people), transport rental and off course our passion and commitment  to see GRASP realised in Malawi.</p>
<p>By supporting this
initial phase of the project you will help Positive Steps to be able to design
the Project Document and access the funds from the financiers, investors and
funding organizations. This will create a life time opportunity for the rural
communities in Malawi who will access the right to clean and sustainable energy
for lighting, clean drinking water, biogas for cooking and increase their
agricultural productivity. Above all the project (GRASP) will reduce household
poverty by increasing their income from $1.25/day to possibly $4.50/day.</p>
<p>If we do not raise the
total sum targetted, we will try to raise the rest from other sources and NGO's

<p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p></p>
<p>This project is a
world changer for rural Malawian. Increased possibilities for health facilities
and hospitals to e.g. assist deliveries, perform emergency mini-surgeries and
operate emergency rooms during evening and night contributes to improved
health. It will reduce maternal deaths caused by inefficient health systems
(poor lighting); increased lighting in schools and the possibility to do
homework and reading at home during the evening contributes to improved
education; agricultural productivity will increase as the project targets to
produce organic fertilizer; lighting and productive use of electricity from the
solar technology extends business hours and improves the possibilities for
growth for income generating activities, such as phone/battery recharging businesses;
IT based activities (E-banking), refrigeration, and oilseed pressing and costs
incurred in the purchase of fuel will be reduced through increased access to
electricity, allowing more money to be spent on food, health care, education
and other basic needs which will result in money saved and poverty reduced.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p></p><p>

The Unist'ot'en Camp lies directly in the path of both the Enbridge Northern Gateway tar sands pipeline and the Pacific Trails LNG pipeline proposals. The blockade is maintained by the Wet'suwet'en, an indigenous nation whose land would be crossed by these projects, with support from a broad range of allies. The Wet'suwet'en have given legal notice to the companies and governments that these projects will not cross their land. 
These folks need supplies to maintain the blockade - and that's where we come in! We can't all be there, but we can keep the frontline blockaders fed through the long Northern BC winter. 
Resistance to these projects is huge and growing, and the Unist'ot'en Camp is literally ground zero for this resistance. If all the other avenues of resistance fail - and we can't be 100% confident that they will succeed - this physical blockade will be absolutely critical. They have already successfully evicted company agents and prospectors.
Immediate Needs
Funding
We (myself and anyone who wants to step up to help!) need money to purchase ethically raised beef from a farm in the Comox Valley. I live and work on a farm that raises grass fed beef, and that's where I'll be sourcing the beef.We may get a good deal from the farmer - this is pending. We'll then donate our time to process it into beef jerky (and possibly some other products to send up, as well: salt beef, canned beef stock).

 The Impact
 Donating to this is directly supporting the Unist'ot'en Camp. If you're one of those folks (and I know there are lots) who feels passionately that these extreme energy projects can not be allowed, that indigenous law can not be ignored, and that we need to work together to stop these projects by any means necessary - this is a way to provide material support. Real support. 
I know that there are lots of folks who feel incredibly strongly about this - and yet feel powerless. Here's your power! And here's your opportunity to get more involved. We need everyone who can to do everything they can to resist these insane projects. If we don't, no one will and our world will be gone.
It is also important to the Unist'ot'en Camp that food be sourced ethically. While the most important this is to keep folks fed, it is also vitally important, according to the camp's leaders, to be sourcing ethical, responsible food. That's the world we are going for, so it's what we should support when we can. And we can. 
Risks & Challenges
 There's not much risk to forgoing a dinner out and putting the money toward this instead this. Or donating more, as much as you can.
In fact the much greater risk is not doing everything we can to stop these pipelines and extreme energy projects.
As I said, the food is going up one way or another - we need folks to pitch in to cover the costs.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

is the brain child of Evelyn Libal and Juma Bongo Saidi. While studying sustainable
agriculture and development in Kenya Juma and I fell in love.  Now we are pouring our heart, soul, and hands
into applying our many talents and skills to the dynamic improvement of our
area in coastal Kenya.
I have degrees in Environmental Studies and Horticulture from the University of Wisconsin Madison as
well as a lifetime of experience growing up on an organic farm. We are in the
infancy of our project.  This initial
money is to run trials on the ideas we would like to implement to assess
feasibility and gain experience of challenges and solutions on a small scale.
This way when we write for larger grants we will have a better idea of what is
involved and how to do it efficiently the first time! Our goal is to create opportunities because while our community suffers seriously from poverty of the pocket they are gifted with a wealth of human capitol waiting for a chance. We budget $50 a week to take care of our needs, everything else goes to building and creating this project.  Our ideas are as follows:</h3><div><br/></div>
<h3>1.<span> 
</span>Compost, swales,
mulch, and terra perta creation to build a healthy soil in a heavily weathered,
eroded, and desertifying area for local vegetable production.  This uses low cost or free local resources to
create a more fertile growing environment for farmers to grow their food
locally instead of shipping it in.  It
also is a demonstration of organic soil building farming to give an alternative
to synthetic fertilizers and the damage to the reef ecosystem synthetic
fertilizers cause.  See our website for
more on this we have almost completed this project and are watching to see how
our plants grow!  We only need $250 to
finish paying for the transport of compost from the market (divert waste
stream), charcoal from the shops in town (the unusable small chips and dust),
and to employ our neighbor to cut and bring grass for mulch (employing women!).   </h3><div><br/></div>
<h3>2.<span> 
</span>Mini-aquaponics!
Aquaponics is the growing of fish and plants to make a closed loop system of
fertilization and cleaning. Before jumping into a big aquaponics project we
want to test our design on a small low risk scale.  We would make plant rafts of 1 liter water
bottles.  We want to source the media
locally using coconut husks and fired clay balls. Above the tank with the
floating plant rafts would be gutters with more plants. The water would be
pumped with a small solar pump through the gutters and fall back into the tank
adding oxygen to the water.  Total
project cost about $300.  $100 for
barrels, $15 for gutter, $100 for pump, $25 for wood to build support
structure, $100 miscellaneous (getting fish, transportation to tour aquaponics
in the area, seeds, and the things I have not thought of yet and it always
costs more than expected) coconut, clay balls, and recycled water bottles are
free and we have an old mosquito net to protect our babies from the ravages of
insects. </h3><div><br/></div>
<h3>3.<span> 
</span>Micro greens to
Crickets.  In Kenya crickets are an acceptable
food source.  We want to assess if the local
varieties of crickets can be domesticated. 
If they do well we would like to have growing containers that would
switch between micro-greens and crickets. 
The cricket waste is an excellent fertilizer. Crickets are very
efficient at becoming a high protein and fat snack while microgreens are packed
with vitimins, minerals, and phyto-nutrients. 
This initial stage is to see if the local crickets can survive and
reproduce in captivity. If this can be accomplished the next stage is to see
what kind of market there is for greens and crickets.  Given that my neighbors are pretty
universally malnourished and there is a serious lack of access to fresh food in
our area I think we stand a pretty good chance! Again if on a small scale this
is successful we will write plans for expansion. Total cost $200. Barrels+
transport $100, Dirt $40, Getting crickets $10, things we don’t know we need
yet $50. </h3><div><br/></div>
<h3>4.<span> 
</span>Rain barrels and pond
digging to expand terrace. Total $250. Barrels $100, pond digging $50, tires
and transportation $100.  </h3><div><br/></div>
<h3>5.<span> 
</span>Road. The goal is to
have a safe road where sustainable forestry on the edges will provide a portion
of the cost for maintenance as well as balancing the carbon expenditure of a
road Infrastructure is one of the best gifts you can give. Having a road
connects you to the market allowing economic growth. Not having a road really
holds people back. For example our neighbor has cows.  When it rains he cannot come out to take care
of his cows. His cows suffer and he does not get paid. A good road also keeps
you from bodily harm.  The young men who
do motorcycle taxi pretty universally have large burn scars from falling on the
awful roads and getting stuck under the searing exhaust pipe.  They also have to spend a lot of time and
money fixing their motorcycles when they fall and break something. Our
community wants to level the road, dig ditches, and plant many a tree on the
sides.  Any money left over will continue
the building of the road.  We are going
to start with a half kilometer stretch to test our estimates and know what is
needed for a larger project. Something I have learned in Kenya is that
you can really never know what is going to happen. You just need to do it and
adapt accordingly. Optimally the trees could earn the area carbon credits which
could go toward maintenance and put the power of infrastructure building into
the local communities hands instead of waiting for it to trickle down.   Estimated
project cost $3000.  Leveling the road
$500 (local labor), Planting trees $500(trees, manure, water, rent truck to
transport), compensation of farmers for land $1000, gravel $1000.  Once again, this trial will allow us to make
detailed plans and allow us to learn the ropes so we can implement much larger
self sustaining road projects. We need to implement an accountability and
transparency system for handling the money that comes from the potential carbon
credits and harvesting of the trees.   </h3><div><br/></div>
<h3>6.<span> 
</span>Back to School.  We host talent shows for school supplies and
get books for schools.  We need
children’s books!!!!! Ship them to Juma Bongo Saidi at P.O. box 160 Mtwapa, Kenya.  They will all find homes in the classrooms
surrounding us!  To learn more visit <a href=""http://growingfutureskenya.org/?page_id=47"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://growingfutureskenya.org/?page_id=47</a>.
 The stereotype of malnourished kid from Africa is unfortunately correct in our area but they are
so much more awesome than just that. We want to encourage and reward their
multitude of talents. High prizes are new school uniforms, shoes, back packs at
$10.  Small prizes are pencils, notebooks,
erasers, coloring supplies. We would buy these in bulk. We also need speakers

about $2,500 to host competitions and develop our model for doing outreach and

is the brain child of Evelyn Libal and Juma Bongo Saidi. While studying sustainable
agriculture and development in Kenya Juma and I fell in love.  Now we are pouring our heart, soul, and hands
into applying our many talents and skills to the dynamic improvement of our
area in coastal Kenya.
I have degrees in Environmental Studies and Horticulture from the University of Wisconsin Madison as
well as a lifetime of experience growing up on an organic farm. We are in the
infancy of our project.  This initial
money is to run trials on the ideas we would like to implement to assess
feasibility and gain experience of challenges and solutions on a small scale.
This way when we write for larger grants we will have a better idea of what is
involved and how to do it efficiently the first time! Our goal is to create opportunities because while our community suffers seriously from poverty of the pocket they are gifted with a wealth of human capitol waiting for a chance. We budget $50 a week to take care of our needs, everything else goes to building and creating this project.  Our ideas are as follows:
1. 
Compost, swales,
mulch, and terra perta creation to build a healthy soil in a heavily weathered,
eroded, and desertifying area for local vegetable production.  This uses low cost or free local resources to
create a more fertile growing environment for farmers to grow their food
locally instead of shipping it in.  It
also is a demonstration of organic soil building farming to give an alternative
to synthetic fertilizers and the damage to the reef ecosystem synthetic
fertilizers cause.  See our website for
more on this we have almost completed this project and are watching to see how
our plants grow!  We only need $250 to
finish paying for the transport of compost from the market (divert waste
stream), charcoal from the shops in town (the unusable small chips and dust),
and to employ our neighbor to cut and bring grass for mulch (employing women!).   
2. 
Mini-aquaponics!
Aquaponics is the growing of fish and plants to make a closed loop system of
fertilization and cleaning. Before jumping into a big aquaponics project we
want to test our design on a small low risk scale.  We would make plant rafts of 1 liter water
bottles.  We want to source the media
locally using coconut husks and fired clay balls. Above the tank with the
floating plant rafts would be gutters with more plants. The water would be
pumped with a small solar pump through the gutters and fall back into the tank
adding oxygen to the water.  Total
project cost about $300.  $100 for
barrels, $15 for gutter, $100 for pump, $25 for wood to build support
structure, $100 miscellaneous (getting fish, transportation to tour aquaponics
in the area, seeds, and the things I have not thought of yet and it always
costs more than expected) coconut, clay balls, and recycled water bottles are
free and we have an old mosquito net to protect our babies from the ravages of
insects. 
3. 
Micro greens to
Crickets.  In Kenya crickets are an acceptable
food source.  We want to assess if the local
varieties of crickets can be domesticated. 
If they do well we would like to have growing containers that would
switch between micro-greens and crickets. 
The cricket waste is an excellent fertilizer. Crickets are very
efficient at becoming a high protein and fat snack while microgreens are packed
with vitimins, minerals, and phyto-nutrients. 
This initial stage is to see if the local crickets can survive and
reproduce in captivity. If this can be accomplished the next stage is to see
what kind of market there is for greens and crickets.  Given that my neighbors are pretty
universally malnourished and there is a serious lack of access to fresh food in
our area I think we stand a pretty good chance! Again if on a small scale this
is successful we will write plans for expansion. Total cost $200. Barrels+
transport $100, Dirt $40, Getting crickets $10, things we don’t know we need
yet $50. 
4. 
Rain barrels and pond
digging to expand terrace. Total $250. Barrels $100, pond digging $50, tires
and transportation $100.  
5. 
Road. The goal is to
have a safe road where sustainable forestry on the edges will provide a portion
of the cost for maintenance as well as balancing the carbon expenditure of a
road Infrastructure is one of the best gifts you can give. Having a road
connects you to the market allowing economic growth. Not having a road really
holds people back. For example our neighbor has cows.  When it rains he cannot come out to take care
of his cows. His cows suffer and he does not get paid. A good road also keeps
you from bodily harm.  The young men who
do motorcycle taxi pretty universally have large burn scars from falling on the
awful roads and getting stuck under the searing exhaust pipe.  They also have to spend a lot of time and
money fixing their motorcycles when they fall and break something. Our
community wants to level the road, dig ditches, and plant many a tree on the
sides.  Any money left over will continue
the building of the road.  We are going
to start with a half kilometer stretch to test our estimates and know what is
needed for a larger project. Something I have learned in Kenya is that
you can really never know what is going to happen. You just need to do it and
adapt accordingly. Optimally the trees could earn the area carbon credits which
could go toward maintenance and put the power of infrastructure building into
the local communities hands instead of waiting for it to trickle down.   Estimated
project cost $3000.  Leveling the road
$500 (local labor), Planting trees $500(trees, manure, water, rent truck to
transport), compensation of farmers for land $1000, gravel $1000.  Once again, this trial will allow us to make
detailed plans and allow us to learn the ropes so we can implement much larger
self sustaining road projects. We need to implement an accountability and
transparency system for handling the money that comes from the potential carbon
credits and harvesting of the trees.   
6. 
Back to School.  We host talent shows for school supplies and
get books for schools.  We need
children’s books!!!!! Ship them to Juma Bongo Saidi at P.O. box 160 Mtwapa, Kenya.  They will all find homes in the classrooms
surrounding us!  To learn more visit http://growingfutureskenya.org/?page_id=47.
 The stereotype of malnourished kid from Africa is unfortunately correct in our area but they are
so much more awesome than just that. We want to encourage and reward their
multitude of talents. High prizes are new school uniforms, shoes, back packs at
$10.  Small prizes are pencils, notebooks,
erasers, coloring supplies. We would buy these in bulk. We also need speakers
for dance offs.  We would like to spend
about $2,500 to host competitions and develop our model for doing outreach and
empowerment through expression and KEEP KIDS IN SCHOOL! $300 will go to sending
the books I have in the USA
to Kenya,
$2,200 goes to buying school supplies, obtaining area to display art work,
speakers, and transportation. This is crazy fun and does a lot to help kid’s
confidence and creativity. (Schools cannot afford art classes or after school

                                                               Who We Are

David Leonhardt and Gail Johnson co-founded GlassDharma, home of the original glass straw, and created the glass straw industry. The website went up in 2008 and since then these environmentally friendly straws have been shipped to over 50 countries. 

                                                              The Mission

We are here to educate people about Plastic Pollution and the alternatives to single-use plastics as we operate a sustainable green business manufacturing glass drinking straws. One glass straw can replace 1000's of plastic ones. 

                                                         Campaign Objective




                                      


""Thank you for the straw and a very informative video. Great event!""  Lacey K.

We are asking for your support in growing our Earth Day project. We have had an explosive 7th Annual Free Straw Earth Day Giveaway (link on our website top of home page through Earth Day, April 22) that allows 1000's of people to become aware of the impact of their everyday choices related to single-use plastics and the alternatives that are available. Your financial help and any of the 10 tasks listed at the end would be fantastic!
There are many people who don't even think about the impact of their plastic choices and we need you to help change that -  for everyone's health, for our kids futures. for the animals, fish and birds, for our oceans and for our planet! 

 See below for details on how we did not anticipate such a huge response and now need your help to expand this project keeping the flow of education and changed behavior going to help our planet! Our successful Earth Day promotion = more people = more awareness = less plastic consumption = a cleaner and healthier planet = you making a huge difference!  Thank you so much for your consideration!  


                                                             Are you in?


""Woo hoo, straws ordered for mommy and kiddos! Thanks for the great opportunity and the education. I knew the plastic and trash issue was bad, but that video was very informative .. Plus all the posts leading up to today. The quiz and form were perfect from my iPhone and the code was sent instantly! ""  Jen S.

                



What We Are Asking From You


We are inviting you to help us ensure that this year's 7th Annual Free Earth
Day Project is phenomenally successful! 


Our original cost projections included:

(and we'll keep this simple as the actual figures get quite complicated)


Product costs (materials & labor)

Shipping
Webmaster labor costs
Social media labor costs

What actually happened:
On the 5th Day of our Earth Day Free Straw Giveaway, notices on at least 4 very large websites with links to our Giveaway went totally viral.  This resulted in 1000's of orders more than we had anticipated.  In addition to the unplanned production, and shipping costs, there is also website and social media expenses needed to modify our Free Straw Giveaway.
What we have done:

Modified the Earth Day Giveaway so that all future participants would have to pay $3 shipping to defray future costs and be able to keep the Earth Day Giveaway going until originally planned, Earth Day, April 22.
Shipped the 1st thousand orders
Started this Indiegogo campaign so that we do not have to go back on our word to the thousands that have successfully taken the Earth Day quiz about the video above. We  need your help to be able to ship to them. 

Total costs that we are asking your help with;  $15,000

We have become really excited about the potential of both these campaigns to make a much bigger impact on our planet than we would have ever even imagined! We believe there are no accidents - our mistake in not setting a limit to begin with is now a potential blessing for the planet with so many people receiving this valuable education!



Check out the link at the bottom of this page to the history of our Earth Day Free Straw Giveaway as well as the section on Additional Background Notes.                                      Funding Need Summary                                     Total:  $15,000



We would love to raise this amount or more - the priority is to get our already ordered free straws out there as soon as we can!

""Hooray, I received my earth day straw! Thank you so much GlassDharma for the opportunity to receive a free straw and learn about our earth.                  Cindy & Tom M.

<p>In the four years that students have been working tirelessly on this campaign, REInvestment has had a significant impact on campus.

<p>~ Our inner light does not burn on fossil fuels. ~</p></div>","OUR STORYSince 2011, Earlham College students with the Responsible Energy Investment (REInvestment) Campaign have been calling for Earlham to DIVEST from fossil fuels – because as a Quaker school that holds values of peace and justice, Earlham has no business profiting from the violence of the fossil fuel industry.
In the four years that students have been working tirelessly on this campaign, REInvestment has had a significant impact on campus. Even though Earlham has not yet committed to divest, the campaign has been a vehicle for education. The dozens of students who have worked on this campaign have learned valuable grassroots organizing skills, which they will surely use when they move on to be leaders and changemakers post-Earlham, and they've learned about extreme fossil fuel extraction and its impact on people, communities, and the climate.

SAROS uses tried and true, off-the-shelf reverse osmosis systems which are among the most efficient systems in the world. These systems feature an energy recovery device that acts like a turbocharger for the incoming seawater, boosting the incoming pressure, as well as providing massive energy savings.

SAROS can be used anywhere located near an ocean, but California has such a dense and large population that our device may not be the best option for their widespread drought conditions. Desalination has a wide range of useful scales - you can find large desalination plants that make 50 million gallons a day and simpler systems that make just 100 gallons a day. Just like a single wind farm couldn’t possibly supply all of Los Angeles’ power demands, a single wave-powered desalination unit couldn’t possibly supply enough fresh water to a city as big as LA. However, a SAROS unit has the ability to aid smaller communities and townships in need, which is why they are our target markets.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>How do you get the water back to shore?</strong></p><p> </p><p><i>Currently, we simply pump the water back to shore through a small, flexible hose.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Why hasn’t anyone done this before?</strong></p><p> </p><p><i>The time for a wave-powered desalination unit has never been better than right now. Environmental concerns and water shortages are some of the hottest topics today. Innovation and development require the right amount of ingredients - money, </i><i>motivation</i><i> and knowledge - to make things happen. We have </i><i>a very unique</i><i> combination of those things that allow us to tackle something that others haven’t followed up on in the past.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Who needs/could benefit from a SAROS unit?</strong></p><p> </p><p><i>There are over 230 million people living on islands and in coastal communities that lack access to fresh water, as well as the resources and infrastructures to use traditional methods of retrieving water for drinking, </i><i>washing</i><i> and cooking. These communities are the target populations for a SAROS unit. Though really anybody looking for a less-expensive, environmentally-friendly, sustainable source of desalinated water could benefit from a SAROS unit as long as they lived close to the ocean.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>How much water do people really need?</strong></p><p> </p><p><i>While this depends on the situation, a typical US household (family of 4) uses 400 gallons of water a day. The average person in the United States uses about 80-120 gallons of water per day and the largest use of household water is flushing a toilet. In “developing areas,” the World Health Organization reports that individuals use 11.6 gallons of water per day. In an emergency, an individual needs only 2 gallons of drinking water to survive, whereas 5-10 gallons would be required for eating, drinking and basic sanitation. This means that in an emergency, one SAROS unit could provide drinking water for 1,750 people. It’s also possible that one unit could provide the daily water requirements in a “developing area” for over 300 people.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>Are we really running out of water? There seems to be plenty where I live.</strong></p><p> </p><p><i>Water usage and conservation are probably some of the most poorly understood concepts today. Water is a finite resource, but very few people treat it like one. The global average water footprint is 1,000 gallons of water per day, which includes domestic, industrial and agricultural usage. Domestic water use (household) is 8% of that total. Industrial use is 22% (i.e. food processing or clothing manufacturing) and agricultural is 70% (irrigation). It takes water to make the clothes we wear and the food we eat, let alone to get a drink when we’re thirsty. As water resources diminish around the world we will all be impacted. Coming up with sustainable solutions for our global water needs becomes more compelling every day.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>How much does the water produced by a SAROS unit cost?</strong></p><p> </p><p><i>We’re on track to bring the cost of a gallon of desalinated water to 6/10 of a penny (0.6 cents) using the SAROS unit. Non-desalinated water is less expensive because it’s purified fresh water (usually from lake or groundwater). For example, in Charlotte, North Carolina (non-desalinated) water from a utility costs 3/10 of a penny. In Malibu, California water from a utility costs 8/10 of a penny due to demand and water shortage conditions. Desalinated water costs more, but it’s the only affordable, sustainable solution for smaller communities located near the ocean.

The evidence is seen in ocean waves’ ability to toss around massive ships, rip apart naval structures, or even just knock you off your feet at a day at the beach. SAROS uses the enormous forces generated by ocean waves to pump water through a reverse osmosis desalination system. Desalination is a notoriously expensive and energy-hungry process, so what better place to use the vast amount of energy found in the ocean? How can SAROS help?Currently, water can be almost $5 a gallon in locations experiencing water scarcity. Once our buoy is deployed to a pilot location, the clean water produced will be less than 1 cent per gallon. At that phase of the pilot:$10 = 1000 gallons of clean water, enough for a family of 4 for 21 days $25 = 2500 gallons of clean water, enough for a family of 4 for 52 days$30 = 3000 gallons of clean water, enough for a family of 4 for 63 days$50 = 5000 gallons of clean water, enough for a family of 4 for 104 days$100= 10,000 gallons of clean water, enough for a family of 4 for 208 daysAccording to WHO guideline, each individual person should have access to 12 gallons a day for drinking, sanitation and cooking.As the SAROS buoy rises and falls with passing swells, it works against its mooring tether to drive the pumps underneath the hood of the buoy. These pumps intake seawater and pump it back to shore under pressure. Before entering the desalination system, a device which we call the WaveBank transforms the surges of incoming water from the buoy into a smooth, steady stream of water into the reverse osmosis system. SAROS uses tried and true, off-the-shelf reverse osmosis systems which are among the most efficient systems in the world. These systems feature an energy recovery device that acts like a turbocharger for the incoming seawater, boosting the incoming pressure, as well as providing massive energy savings. The water that comes out is fresh, clean, and ready to drink! No chemicals or pollutants are added at any point, and reverse osmosis removes salt, bacteria, and any other harmful contents from the seawater. All this powered only by the motion of the ocean. While we’re seeking collaborative efforts with researchers, organizations and strategic partners to further advance our program, we need YOUR initial support to help us get our project above water. By supporting our campaign, you’ll be helping us make strides to get fresh water to people who need it the most all around the world. Join us in our efforts to responsibly turn waves into fresh water. Your support is what will make all the difference. All of the money raised from this campaign will go into testing pilot programs in locations around the world, A significant supply of energy exists in our oceans, yet harnessing this energy in a useful and efficient manner has been a challenge...until now.We decided to take on that challenge and developed our first proof of concept. After building multiple systems and conducting countless tests, we took everything we learned and used it to build our latest prototype. From our first prototype to our current prototype, we have come a long way and hope that you’ll help us continue our research and development.    Reverse osmosis (RO) is currently one of the most efficient ways to desalinate seawater. A single RO membrane not much bigger than a rolled newspaper can produce over a hundred gallons a day of fresh water, making it immensely more practical than desalination through other means. Unfortunately, RO requires pressures in the range of 800psi, meaning desalination is still a significant task. This is where SAROS enters the process. Engineers Chris Matthews and Justin Sonnett have kept the design of SAROS simple. By using common components, they’re able to place them above water and on shore to avoid complicated installation and maintenance. By concentrating only on fresh water production and not electricity production, SAROS has much higher efficiency. By eliminating energy-related emissions, SAROS’ new design and adaptability provide a unique opportunity to supply clean water, expand the water supply, preserve ecological and environmental needs of communities and address economic issues of energy and water pricing.  Fresh water scarcity has become a primary global issue and current market technologies focus on large-scale desalination plants, which are harmful to the environment and have high operating expenses. While small-scale desalination systems are on the market, they have complicated components, don’t promote sustainability and require imported fossil fuels or large amounts of electricity. Supporting SAROS’ sustainable ways will help make the endeavors to create fresh water better for the world and more attainable for others. Typical desalination processes can be taxing on the environment, especially coastal communities. Unlike traditional methods that require a huge amount of power, typically generated by burning fuel oil, SAROS uses clean, renewable wave energy and produces zero emissions and minimal salt brine concentration.SAROS also creates the opportunity to bring desalination to less developed regions that are in dire need of fresh drinking water. By removing dependencies on outside resources, communities will be able to focus on their daily tasks as SAROS provides them with a consistent supply of new, fresh water.SAROS can cut the cost currently associated with producing fresh water in half. By utilizing only the energy within ocean waves to power the desalination process, SAROS eliminates the need for fossil fuel and electricity, which is typically required for traditional desalination methods. It’s time for everyone to have access to affordable, clean water.The innovative, wave-powered technology used in SAROS could also be configured to do things like generate electricity, autonomously pump water to clean up oil spills or even filter plastic from our ocean. The amount of potential good that SAROS can bring is as exciting as it is endless.The global water shortage affects people from around the world, especially those in challenging economic situations who can’t afford costly water delivery options. Imagine if you had to walk hours every day just to get fresh water for you and your family. Often times, families in Africa, South Asia and the Middle East designate women and children, particularly young girls, to be responsible for gathering water.Women in areas with water shortages can spend several hours a day in the pursuit of fresh water, taking away from the time they could be using to work or pursue an education. Sometimes women and children even drop out of school for reasons related to water scarcity.By introducing fresh water sources closer to these communities that need it the most, you can help alleviate these issues. Studies show that girls’ school attendance increased significantly for every hour reduction in water collection. Children are also healthier when clean water is accessible. By introducing eco-friendly solutions, such as SAROS, you have the potential to impact women and children in important educational, economic and political ways. SAROS has been named a finalist at the 2016 Savannah Ocean Exchange where we will present our sustainable water innovation this November!SAROS has also received plenty of awards and recognition including being named as a semi-finalist at Hello Tomorrow Competition and the St. Andrew Prize for the Environment. SAROS started as a senior design project at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Chris Matthews and Justin Sonnett, then seniors in the Mechanical Engineering program, had a goal to prove that it is possible to sufficiently pressurize water and perform Reverse Osmosis (RO) using only wave energy. After graduation, Chris and Justin were given the opportunity to advance the SAROS technology and provide a solution for the water scarcity problem plaguing coastal communities. SAROS’ mission is far from over. In fact, it’s just the beginning and it starts with you.   We firmly believe SAROS is an answer to fresh water supply issues currently experienced by isolated island and coastal communities and will become a player in the much-needed diversification of even the developed world’s water supply.Our team of advisors is comprised of industry leaders with decades of experience in the financial, energy and sustainability sectors. These members have dedicated valuable time and resources and have contributed to the success of our inaugural venture, SAROS Desalination.  By proving that we can turn ocean waves into clean, drinkable, fresh water with our first SAROS prototype, the team is now moving to the next phase of testing and optimizing our current prototype. By focusing solely on water production and targeting areas in need of sustainable, small-scale desalination, our team has identified a clear market for advancing the SAROS technology. Chris has always enjoyed tackling new and difficult problems, and is now taking the opportunity to face two of the world’s biggest challenges: the global need for fresh water, and the ever growing threat of climate change. An environmentalist and humanitarian, Chris is using his passion for problem solving, and his training as an engineer, to help make SAROS a success. As co-creator of SAROS and a founding member of the company, his main engineering focus centers on mathematical and computer modeling, as well as analysis of system characteristics and performance. Additionally he focuses on the design and implementation of instrumentation and data acquisition methods for testing. His whole life, Justin has been fascinated by how things work, their form and their function. Passionate about engineering, technology and design, he’s experienced with bringing innovative ideas from the back of the napkin to reality. As one of the founding members and Director of Research & Development, Justin’s role spans engineering and design in order to implement creative solutions, optimize unit performance and maximize customer value. A lifelong surfer and lover of anything related to the beach, SAROS gives him the unique opportunity to merge his love for the waves with his passion for design. Justin loves to tinker and enjoys taking what he learns both in the garage and in the water, and applying it to engineering topics in the office. Organización Pro Ambiente Sustentable (OPAS) We’re currently partnering with an environmental non-profit, Organización Pro Ambiente Sustentable, that is located in Puerto Rico and focuses on implementing environmental programs to achieve sustainable island communities. Providing sustainable, fresh water solutions to areas in need will be a focal point of the partnership with OPAS. As part of this partnership, we will be conducting a pilot study on Cajo de Muertos, Ponce. SAROS will not just be supplying drinking water to this island population, but will be supporting the protection of the island by branching out to flora conservation as well. Colorado Haiti Project (CHP) SAROS is working with the Colorado Haiti Project (CHP) to initiate a pilot project in the community of Petit Trou de Nippes. CHP works in partnership with rural Haitian communities to support their rise out of extreme poverty. While construction of 12 safe water wells has eased their water crisis, Haitian groundwater is jeopardized by encroaching salt water. Additionally, the devastation wrought by a hurricane like Hurricane Matthew demonstrates just how fragile safe water sources are in these areas. SAROS has the potential to solve this crisis with a more sustainable solution.  Does SAROS make electricity? SAROS does not currently make electricity. We could adapt the unit to do so, but our number one goal is to produce fresh water for people in need. We’ve found the economics are more favorable by focusing directly on producing water. By skipping the middle step of generating electricity and only desalinating water, the process becomes more efficient, simpler and less expensive. What is desalination? Desalination is the process of removing salt from water. With SAROS, we’re able to take seawater and remove enough salt to make drinkable water that can also be used for irrigation. How much water does a SAROS unit make? One SAROS machine can make around 3,500 gallons per day, and we can group units together to provide up to 50,000 gallons per site (10-20 units). Could SAROS be used in California? Sure! SAROS can be used anywhere located near an ocean, but California has such a dense and large population that our device may not be the best option for their widespread drought conditions. Desalination has a wide range of useful scales - you can find large desalination plants that make 50 million gallons a day and simpler systems that make just 100 gallons a day. Just like a single wind farm couldn’t possibly supply all of Los Angeles’ power demands, a single wave-powered desalination unit couldn’t possibly supply enough fresh water to a city as big as LA. However, a SAROS unit has the ability to aid smaller communities and townships in need, which is why they are our target markets. How do you get the water back to shore? Currently, we simply pump the water back to shore through a small, flexible hose. Why hasn’t anyone done this before? The time for a wave-powered desalination unit has never been better than right now. Environmental concerns and water shortages are some of the hottest topics today. Innovation and development require the right amount of ingredients - money, motivation and knowledge - to make things happen. We have a very unique combination of those things that allow us to tackle something that others haven’t followed up on in the past. Who needs/could benefit from a SAROS unit? There are over 230 million people living on islands and in coastal communities that lack access to fresh water, as well as the resources and infrastructures to use traditional methods of retrieving water for drinking, washing and cooking. These communities are the target populations for a SAROS unit. Though really anybody looking for a less-expensive, environmentally-friendly, sustainable source of desalinated water could benefit from a SAROS unit as long as they lived close to the ocean. How much water do people really need? While this depends on the situation, a typical US household (family of 4) uses 400 gallons of water a day. The average person in the United States uses about 80-120 gallons of water per day and the largest use of household water is flushing a toilet. In “developing areas,” the World Health Organization reports that individuals use 11.6 gallons of water per day. In an emergency, an individual needs only 2 gallons of drinking water to survive, whereas 5-10 gallons would be required for eating, drinking and basic sanitation. This means that in an emergency, one SAROS unit could provide drinking water for 1,750 people. It’s also possible that one unit could provide the daily water requirements in a “developing area” for over 300 people. Are we really running out of water? There seems to be plenty where I live. Water usage and conservation are probably some of the most poorly understood concepts today. Water is a finite resource, but very few people treat it like one. The global average water footprint is 1,000 gallons of water per day, which includes domestic, industrial and agricultural usage. Domestic water use (household) is 8% of that total. Industrial use is 22% (i.e. food processing or clothing manufacturing) and agricultural is 70% (irrigation). It takes water to make the clothes we wear and the food we eat, let alone to get a drink when we’re thirsty. As water resources diminish around the world we will all be impacted. Coming up with sustainable solutions for our global water needs becomes more compelling every day. How much does the water produced by a SAROS unit cost? We’re on track to bring the cost of a gallon of desalinated water to 6/10 of a penny (0.6 cents) using the SAROS unit. Non-desalinated water is less expensive because it’s purified fresh water (usually from lake or groundwater). For example, in Charlotte, North Carolina (non-desalinated) water from a utility costs 3/10 of a penny. In Malibu, California water from a utility costs 8/10 of a penny due to demand and water shortage conditions. Desalinated water costs more, but it’s the only affordable, sustainable solution for smaller communities located near the ocean. For example, in the Virgin Islands it costs about 1.8 cents per gallon to buy water from a utility. SAROS’ water is about a third of that price. How does the SAROS team collect enough data to know how to better their design?Opening a second office in Wilmington, NC has provided the SAROS team with the opportunity to have the buoy on the water 24/7. This helps accelerate the development process and provides the team with valuable data on how it performs in varying wave conditions.",49.0,0,"1 Campaign

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO FUND HERE?</strong></p><p>By ""PR-activation"" we refer to means and measures to reach some publications and attention for this project within Germany but also world wide. For example, we would put all efforts in creating a relationship with chosen media in order to develop stories together for their channels. Ergo journalists need to travel to Goslar, see the prototype and get relevant information in a way that is tailored to their narrative needs. By this step we hope to enrich our story, find more partners and also a host for the land to build our research cube. PR-activation also entails going one layer deeper into the planning.

The main thing certainly is, to be <strong>part of creating the future</strong> and <strong>helping developing a free speculative design, open-source technique that could transform cities</strong>. The <strong>fuzzy feeling</strong> in your stomache you will get with each help you do, no matter how little it is. For those of you that want to see the prototype IV, we offer several exclusive perks to come to Goslar (Germany) and stay in our guest room. We can then discuss the prototype IV, further involvement and we can show you the beautiful city of Goslar. Each perk helps us covering the expenses we had and will have in order to make this dream come true – this is exactly where our ""Sales / Off Percentages"" come from: For us the amount you fund is way more worth than that specific amount. We highly appreciate each help. <strong>Oh, and we also offer perks for corporate partners.</strong> Here we offer to include their logo on ""The Green Skyline Initiative"" homepage and in case we get the research cube built, the logo will also physically appear there. <strong>You and your company will be positioned as innovators.</strong> Additionally the research cube could be used for special events, if realized.  <strong>Another possible main perk</strong> (and also normal service of janengel.berlin) is to let us check if your house or flat qualifies for a Bioblinds installation and then get your Bioblind (depending on climate zone, space, light, plant, etc.). We promise that we try to offer you a direct and as fast as possible way to your personal Bioblinds. Obviously, the price here is highly individual – therefore, <strong>please indicate your interest with your fund</strong>. We will screen the possibilities and make a ranking for these first customers. So far we have requests to build Bioblinds in Japan close to Tokyo, Katar and Hong Kong. In such cases, the client obviously has to pay for the travel expenses, necessary planning, constructing and planting. </p><p>Additionally we are providing <strong>another very unique perk</strong>. If you or your company want to get a <strong>strategic and integrated communication consultancy, idea development, personal coaching, CEO coaching, narration consultancy, design consultancy or just a philosophical speculative design discussion</strong>, you can book us for a skype consultation for a special rate – we calculate here with 30 minutes. </p><p>We are also super proud to have <strong>another perk</strong>. In order to show that we want each person and their input to be seen in the Bioblinds-Vision we thought about a <strong>free perk for christmas</strong>: We want to try to use two variables for a new approach to <strong>data sonification:</strong> First, the frequency in which people contribute in the first days,  and second, the amounts that are funded. These two variables, as anonymous data sets, will be the basis of the <strong>Bioblinds-song</strong> that we want to offer <strong>for a free download on christmas</strong>. So every funder becomes part of the Bioblinds-Song. For that we work together with a math expert and an amazing composer. Let's see. :-)</p><p><strong>On top of this all we offer two very personal perks from our own collection of beloved things. </strong>We have a beautiful iconic coffeetable book about bamboo ""Die wunderbare Welt des Bambus"". And we have the painting ""Before"" by Australian artist @bradteodoruk (on Insta) . </p><p>If your wishes entail more than one item, please contact us. These specific perks are exclusively available through our campaign. </p><p> </p><p><strong>CONCERNING OUR TIMING AND BUDGET</strong></p><p>We want to be transparent from the start. This step to ""PR-activate"" this research-cube on our overall journey to elaborate globally adaptable and scalable Bioblinds-open-source-data for each architecture for free for everybody, is our third step. The last years we worked on steps 1 and 2 (idea, research, plant finding, prototyping, planning crowd-funding) on our own for free because <strong>we believe that this simple idea democratically could change urban contexts completely and in a sustainable way</strong>. The real costs when it comes to talking to experts, creating technical drawings, renderings, buying parts for prototypes and different mechanisms accumulated to over 40.000 EUR in the last four years. For the PR-activation we calculated, as you can see, 10.000 EUR, the search for an investor (develop presentations and approach potential partners, etc.) we pinned up to 20.000 EUR, the actual step 5 to prepare the construction (getting permits, etc.) is calculated with 25.000 EUR. And this is only before the construction takes place. Step 6, the construction, will cost according to first estimates by specialists around 100.000 EUR, the step 7, the planting and care over three months adds up to 50.000 EUR. Followed by all these steps comes the final research phase (step 8) and the elaboration and supply of the open-source-data (step 9), which was calculated with another 20.000 EUR. Adding the Indiegogo costs (5-8%), bank costs (5-8%) and a puffer (10%), we end up at around 374.220 EUR. We plan to fulfill these steps until autumn 2020 – so <strong>every person world wide could build their own part of ""The Green Skyline Initiative"" in spring 2021. Stay tuned on our website for news and eventually hopefully all data! </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Thanks for reading through this. We highly appreciate your interest in our idea and vision. </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Important note: Even if we wanted we couldn't get universal Bioblinds ready as a product, as it always is a highly individual project. Our toolkit aims at making it possible for each person to adapt our data in the way needed to fit the local requirements. This is a very complex challenge, we are happy to take – in the best case with your help for the step of ""PR-activation"" or more.

</div><p> </p></div>","– How can house facades produce oxygen and improve the living environment? – 


 

 
 BIOBLINDS - ""The Green Skyline Initiative""Bioblinds provide ""oxygen machines"" as organic curtains for individual windows or entire houses and, theoretically, complete skylines. They are a ""speculative design"" project with essentially the vision to offer an open-source-toolkit or online-configurator to build fully functional window blinds made of plants in a Do-It-Yourself/(DIY)-design. All research concerning this project is iterative and to reference Anna Tsing (2018), grows out of the continuous collaborative work. 

 
THE IDEAA digital toolkit with building instructions and e.g. shopping lists for free download in order to build modular or integrated oxygen machines. These are intended for self-cultivation above doors or windows - with products from the hardware store and special tendril or hanging plants. This is a kind of ‘Vertical Gardening 2.0’, or ‘kinetic plant curtains’ for windows, entire houses and thus theoretically complete skylines. The tendrils should not be injured or stressed too much. This is possible thanks to a special mechanism elaborated by a group of amateur engineers, designers, communication and cultural consultants around the creative office Jan Engel.  The direct effects are obvious: Each wall could be green, the oxygen production could be increased accordingly, energy could be saved by cooling effects in the living area, the living comfort is increased and urban contexts are freed of gray.  Just quickly talking about the functions: Bioblinds can block the sun-light and reduce UV radiation, at the same time they provide privacy to the degree you want, as they can be opened and closed, and they also function as thermal isolations. Ergo Bioblinds somehow are “vertical gardening 2.0”. You can even grow food.   Our aim after this campaign:Since it is intended to be a democratic DIY offer, the Bioblinds team is planning a joint land-art project in the 30th anniversary year of the German reunification – with all those interested as bearers of the message of democratic freedom. The idea of ​​Bioblinds should stand as a sign of personal development. For this purpose, the group wants to build a two-story research cube in Osterwieck, on the former inner-German border. This should generate necessary social, mechanical and design data, bringing together both humans and plants of different cultures. WHAT DOES PR ACTIVATION ENTAIL? WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO FUND HERE?By ""PR-activation"" we refer to means and measures to reach some publications and attention for this project within Germany but also world wide. For example, we would put all efforts in creating a relationship with chosen media in order to develop stories together for their channels. Ergo journalists need to travel to Goslar, see the prototype and get relevant information in a way that is tailored to their narrative needs. By this step we hope to enrich our story, find more partners and also a host for the land to build our research cube. PR-activation also entails going one layer deeper into the planning. In detail by creating more technical renderings for specific contexts. Please have also a look at the chapter below about our plans when it comes to ""Timing and Budget"". The time of the anniversary of ""30 Years of German Unity"" in 2019/2020 enhances the message of Bioblinds: “Democratic freedom and personal self-actualisation.”  This is because they, figuratively in this context, transform the former iron curtain into a green curtain, and a former watchtower into a transcultural interaction and community space. As a DIY product, Bioblinds make ""democratic freedom"" tangible and position this important value in a direct economic and social context.  THE IMPACTBioblinds redirect the cycle of “grey eating green” into “green co-existing with whatever there is or will be”. Grey here stands for urban centers and mega-cities. Bioblinds not only enlarge the sqm-area of plants in urban environments but also add oxygen and cool the interiors. Therefore, Bioblinds have a direct impact on the world climate and relate to the “Fridays for Future” movement. Bioblinds can be applied individually or as a community project, to one flat in a house or to the entire house. They can add a structured organic layer over each architecture and they can even be integrated in the planning of the housing or even of a city. For that please get in touch directly. THE PLANT POSSIBILITIESBioblinds function with a variety of plants. So far we did research with ivy, wild wine, stingless blackberry, hop, blauregen, incense, indian mint and dichondra plants. We want to elaborate DIY-toolkits that strongly depend on the climate, personal choice and the plant. In the ""research cube"" we want to collect as much data for different plants and therefore climate zones as possible.   CALL FOR SUPPORTERSTo reach our goal, we are looking for supporters for the next step, the ""reseach cube"", the ""prototype V"" at the former inner-German border. We have to do more research to be able to offer the necessary data for a globally adaptable toolkit – so that really everybody on this planet could do their own Bioblinds. And this research needs to be more elaborated as we ever could do it on our balconies and own houses. That is why we plan the prototype V as a final research cube and also statement for democratic freedom and self-actualisation! Bioblinds not only change how your part of a facade is perceived – most importantly it changes you, as your view with Bioblinds is always calming and beautiful. The idea is designed, especially, for an urban context but, of course, also applicable on the country side or in a desert.   WHAT KIND OF DATA DO WE WANT TO COLLECT IN THE RESEARCH-CUBEWe want to know what people think about the idea. What they would improve or change. And we will try to answer questions like: What plant needs which mechanism-adaptations? What plants work in which parts of the world? What is specifically important when you work with ivy? Can the general mechanism be even more elaborated by collaborative stimuli? How will people move in a unique place like this? How will they use the Bioblinds? How will they interact? How will they create new rooms and break down walls between humans? We aim at collecting this kind of social, scientific, mechanical but also design data and put it all into the toolkit.  This is very important for us as we want this idea to be fulfilled TOGETHER with everybody who is interested. We want to include as much knowledge and input as possible.   THE NEXT NECESSARY STEPBut before this becomes possible we need to “PR-activate” the project to different stakeholders. Already during the construction phase in spring 2020 we want to provide a space for the context of the German Unity Jubilee, e.g. with ""live East / West Influencer Talks"" or ""Community Gardening Workshops"" as well as other intergenerational happenings. ""Organic events"" such as ""the groundbreaking ceremony"", ""the topping-out ceremony"" and ""the opening"" round off the communication potential. A potential partner could position her- or himself as sustainable, innovative and future-oriented.  We actually see each contributor, and even if it’s only with your feedback in the comments, but especially each Backer, as a partner to create the future.  Do you also want, that all people, whether in the countryside, or in the urban centers of this world, can build sustainable ""oxygen machines"" in front of their windows, add the amount of plants in cities and reduce their energy needs?  Then help us with your support!  OUR TEAMOur team consists out of five people, two generations and two countries.Together with the product designer Tino Seubert from London, the lobbyist Anne Jacobs from Berlin, the economy expert Rüdiger Engel from Goslar and the cultural consultant Judith Jacobs, also from Berlin, Jan Engel forms the ""Bioblinds – The Green Skyline Initiative""-core-team. Jan is a communication consultant freelancer since 2013. Before that he used to be working in Berlin as the director of events at Scholz & Friends Berlin and later as a CEO of the Blumberry, both agencies in the WPP-network. Jan had the dream for this initiative when he was 17 years old, staying at a ground-level-apartment in New York City with an 'ugly view'. For more information about the single team members, please click at their profiles or contact us directly.  OUR AIM FOR THIS CROWD-FUNDING CAMPAIGNIn order to reach our “The Green Skyline Initiative”, we want to get an indication from the crowd-funding community, if you think it is a silly idea or if you guys like the idea – that's kind of it. If you like it, we will use the funds to create material that helps to convince more supporters, partners, (e.g. a host for the land), ... . In the very very best case the funded money is already enough to build the prototype V and to do more research and to translate the findings into free open-source data. In short: We want to further work on the free DIY toolkit for every person around the world – no matter what. Just in case we cannot activate the envisioned research cube, we would still try everything in order to do as much research for you guys and all people, interested in Bioblinds, as possible. The findings we collected during the prototypes I-IV already form a solid basis of data, including technical and mechanical specifics, design principles, plant knowledge, shopping-lists, etc. – but they need more elaboration and especially internationalisation.   OUR CHALLENGESThis project faces many challenges to be realized. The way sketched out here, with the help of the research cube at the former inner-german border, is just one possibility that would organically develop in our course of iterative prototyping. We checked various options and with this we reach the highest ratio between research data, costs, attention and relevancy. As already mentioned, the collected data will entail plant specifics, social data, scientific data, mechanism specifics, water systems, design proposals, technical drawings, perhaps even an online-configurator, and definately shopping lists. We plan to provide everything as a download with feedback and contribution or donation possibilities – but in general for free. We believe in open-source and look for likewise-minded people that believe that Commons can change the world – and why shouldn't we see the urban environments as Commons? They are! And they can produce oxygen! Each square meter! :-) Bioblinds is how to make cities into jungles! We want to provide the first edition of data in English.Our utopian (?) dream is to activate the realisation of prototype V, the iterative research cube, at the former inner-German border in 2020 and to be able to provide all knowledge and down-streamed data in autumn 2020 – for everybody to build their own Bioblinds in spring 2021.   PLEASE HELP US WITH YOUR FUNDS, FEEDBACK AND SUPPORT. Request press material if needed. Watch the 2:55min video again: https://vimeo.com/372155680 Watch again the 8 sek trailor:https://vimeo.com/372014312   If you still want to know more about the background, please continue reading. :-)   CONCERNING OUR PROTOTYPESWe built four different iterative prototypes in different sizes and all (!) of them worked. But they are not fully designed yet - untill now we elaborated the core mechanisms and all the construction needs and challenges for the DIY toolkit. Ergo our prototype IV, the most elaborated one and the one shown in the pictures and videos at the single yellow house ((not the envisioned research cube)), is totally DIY and already helps us on our way to create a free digital DIY toolbox. And, most importantly, the prototype works flawlessly! For more material on the existing prototypes, you are more than welcome to visit the showcase-prototype in Goslar, Germany during a ""showcase event"" or on special request as a perk. Of course, we can also send you more videos and pictures of it.  The next prototype V, the one we try to get attention and support for, here at this platform, will be necessary to extract more data on different plants and different mechanisms. All findings at the hopefully-to-become-true prototype V, the envision research cube, will be elaborated to one digital free downloadable data toolkit. These data will be open-source in order to be able to collectively elaborate the idea further and make parts of skylines green as a post-human commons movement.  But after many years of research and prototyping we need your help. With your funds you will let us know, if we should continue to put our personal resources into this vision. We are open for all kinds of feedback. We put this project into concept stage, as our product is sustainable and does NOT need a power-supply as regulated in the community guidelines of this platform. But again, we do have working prototypes –  in real-size on a real window outside of a real house (see pictures). And the prototype IV actually is a commissioned art piece as a holistic conceptual service of www.janengel.berlin Below you see the length of our prototype IV plants and how fast they are growing after the initial installation. They grow very structured and beautiful. Especially during a wind or storm the Bioblinds move very elegantly and breath live into the architecture without any risks of breaking the window glas – due to our special construction.  CONCERNING THE ""ORIGINAL BIOBLINDS""We are able to offer the ""Original Bioblinds"" for individual clients or sponsors – as we did with prototype IV.

These two variables, as anonymous data sets, will be the basis of the Bioblinds-song that we want to offer for a free download on christmas. So every funder becomes part of the Bioblinds-Song. For that we work together with a math expert and an amazing composer. Let's see. :-)On top of this all we offer two very personal perks from our own collection of beloved things. We have a beautiful iconic coffeetable book about bamboo ""Die wunderbare Welt des Bambus"". And we have the painting ""Before"" by Australian artist @bradteodoruk (on Insta) . If your wishes entail more than one item, please contact us. These specific perks are exclusively available through our campaign.  CONCERNING OUR TIMING AND BUDGETWe want to be transparent from the start. This step to ""PR-activate"" this research-cube on our overall journey to elaborate globally adaptable and scalable Bioblinds-open-source-data for each architecture for free for everybody, is our third step. The last years we worked on steps 1 and 2 (idea, research, plant finding, prototyping, planning crowd-funding) on our own for free because we believe that this simple idea democratically could change urban contexts completely and in a sustainable way. The real costs when it comes to talking to experts, creating technical drawings, renderings, buying parts for prototypes and different mechanisms accumulated to over 40.000 EUR in the last four years. For the PR-activation we calculated, as you can see, 10.000 EUR, the search for an investor (develop presentations and approach potential partners, etc.) we pinned up to 20.000 EUR, the actual step 5 to prepare the construction (getting permits, etc.) is calculated with 25.000 EUR. And this is only before the construction takes place. Step 6, the construction, will cost according to first estimates by specialists around 100.000 EUR, the step 7, the planting and care over three months adds up to 50.000 EUR. Followed by all these steps comes the final research phase (step 8) and the elaboration and supply of the open-source-data (step 9), which was calculated with another 20.000 EUR. Adding the Indiegogo costs (5-8%), bank costs (5-8%) and a puffer (10%), we end up at around 374.220 EUR. We plan to fulfill these steps until autumn 2020 – so every person world wide could build their own part of ""The Green Skyline Initiative"" in spring 2021. Stay tuned on our website for news and eventually hopefully all data!  Thanks for reading through this. We highly appreciate your interest in our idea and vision.  Important note: Even if we wanted we couldn't get universal Bioblinds ready as a product, as it always is a highly individual project. Our toolkit aims at making it possible for each person to adapt our data in the way needed to fit the local requirements. This is a very complex challenge, we are happy to take – in the best case with your help for the step of ""PR-activation"" or more. As a commons vision this is a long-term project and therefore we have to operate in steps – but also here we are open for feedback and a high fund could actually make our entire vision possible with just this one step – perhaps depending on you. :-)  We just want to see the vision of ""The Green Skyline Initiative"" at as many places and buildings as possible and therefore all the positive climatic impacts. Since you are already here, reading this, please, please help. :-)  For any questions, more information, feedback, or anything else, please check our Q&A’s or simply write via email to Hello@TheGreenSkylineInitiative.com or via Instagram @thegreenskylineinitiative https://www.instagram.com/the_green_skyline_ini... Last note: As most questions arrived us so far in German, we did the Q&A in German but we are more than happy to translate them for you if needed.  COME AND JOIN ""THE GREEN SKYLINE INITIATIVE""!

<h3>WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?</h3>
<p>In Filma we can't do everything alone. We need your collaboration to fight against plastic waist.</p>
<p>We are a team of four young entrepreneurs that found the solution to one use Covid plastic waist, we transform them into recycled face masks. <strong>You, your children, and the five next generations will suffer the consequences of this new environmental crisis if we do not react NOW.</strong> Do you want to help us?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHY SHOULD YOU CARE ABOUT FILMA'S PROJECT?</h3>
<p>Our face-masks made from recycled masks were created to fight against an issue brought by the crazy situation we’re living nowadays. We’ll go down in history as the generations that survived the world-changing pandemic. </p>
<p>But we won’t let that happen. In FILMA we don’t want to be part of the generations that destroyed our planet due to the overproduction of single-use plastics, especially those produced to combat the pandemic (for example, masks). You don’t want to be part of that generation either. Despite millions of people being told to use face masks, little guidance has been given on how to dispose of or recycle them safely.</p>
<p>                           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612130737/u2sieyrkjy7rgtbat0zc.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>                          </i><u><i>Mohd RASFAN/AFP</i></u></p>
<p>Every month, we use 129 billion face masks worldwide (Enviromental Science &amp; Technology). </p>
<p><strong>So where’s the problem?</strong> Face masks can take over 400 years to decompose.<strong> You, your children, and the five next generations will suffer the consequences. </strong>We need to reduce the contamination of all of this single-use plastic and we need your help to do it!</p>
<p>Based upon our past experiences, we can expect that around 75% of the masks and other pandemic-related waste will end up in landfill, or floating in our oceans.</p>
<p>Our challenge lies in the health risk that face masks present. They can’t be incinerated nor recycled using traditional systems.</p>

<h3><strong>WHY WOULD YOU TRUST US?</strong></h3>
<p>We have been working since the beginning of the pandemic with <strong>two internacional engineers</strong> that have followed us through the whole process and development. </p>
<p>Before being transformed into 3d printer filament, our masks go through quite the treatment. After being completely disinfected, we separate the materials. They are then sent to the shredder which cut them up into small pieces. Those bits of plastic are finally mixed with some plastic pellets and sent through an extruder. That melts the plastic together, forming our filament.</p>

<h3>WHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?</h3>
<p>FILMA is based out of Barcelona. During the past months, we have been putting up collection points all around the city (schools, pharmacies, hospital, local businesses…) where people can throw out their used masks. The few thousand masks that we’ve collected so far have been used to test and create our prototype.</p>
<p>              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612131233/ttqyasxu3x6v5rhn36di.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are also starting to gain governmental aid and with extra help we can offer fair paying jobs to those who have lost their jobs or houses due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>In order to implement our process of collection, treatment, and production of recycled masks on a higher scale and in different cities, <strong>WE NEED YOUR COLLABORATION AND 5 000€.</strong> We want to be as transparent as possible so <strong>let’s see what we’re going to do with your help and money:</strong></p>

In 1958, her brave crew of Quakers and pacifists risked their lives and freedom to nonviolently confront nuclear testing on the high seas. With your help, we'll be able to honor their legacy and continue their mission. <br/><br/><b>The Story</b><br/><br/>Horrified by the ongoing, open-air nuclear bomb tests and the threat of nuclear war, the four-man crew sailed the <i>Golden Rule</i> from California toward the Marshall Islands. Their intention, publicized around the world, was to nonviolently place their bodies in the way of planned nuclear bomb blasts. As they sailed from Honolulu harbor for the testing area, the voyagers were stopped and arrested by the U.S. Coast Guard. Guided by their conscience, the crew attempted to sail again, were arrested once more and detained in the Honolulu city jail until the conclusion of the test cycle. </p><p><b>The Legacy</b></p><p>The publicity surrounding their trial and imprisonment helped ignite public outrage against nuclear weapons testing and alerted the world to the health hazards of nuclear fallout. Five years and many protests later, the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963 was enacted, banning above-ground nuclear testing by the two Superpowers. </p><p>The courageous voyage of the <i>Golden Rule</i> and her crew inspired a similar anti-nuclear voyage in 1971 by the group that would eventually become Greenpeace. </p><p>After the <i>Golden Rule's </i>crew was released from jail in 1958, the boat was sold. Many owners and half a century later, it ended up in northern California's Humboldt Bay, neglected and damaged, finally sinking in a storm.  </p><p>The <i>Golden Rule</i> can continue to be an inspiration for the protection of the environment and active peacemaking.  But first, we've got to get her back in the water.<br/></p><p><br/><b>The Golden Rule Project</b></p><p>When the Vets For Peace learned that this irreplaceable icon of history had literally washed up on their doorstep, they formed the Golden Rule Project and set about the restoration of both the boat and her mission.</p><p>With the gracious help of many talented volunteers and generous donations from around the world, the restoration is 70% complete. But, to get the <i>Golden Rule</i> back on the water now requires some large capital expenses like sails, electronic navigation equipment and specialized labor. </p><p><b>Join The Crew</b></p><p>Our $50,000 goal will cover these costs, allowing us to “splash” in 2014.<br/><br/>The sooner we raise this money, the sooner the <i>Golden Rule </i>will be able to set sail on her new mission as a living museum and floating classroom, educating future generations on the importance of the ocean environment, the risks of nuclear technology and the need for world peace.  <br/><br/>By donating to this project, you become a part of the <i>Golden Rule</i>'s extended crew, helping to unfurl the sails of peace everywhere.  Please step up, step aboard and help us launch the dream.</p><p><b>The Perks</b></p><p>Besides knowing that you're an integral part of this important piece of peace history, your monetary contribution will get you all sorts of cool tokens of appreciation. Join us for sea trials aboard the reborn <i>Golden Rule</i> as we remake history. Become an official Plank Owner. Have your name engraved on a permanent brass plaque aboard the boat. Score some fantastic bling. And lots more. Check the giving levels and pick your favorite. Every bit helps and no contribution is too small.</p><p>Can't contribute cash?  There are lots of other ways to participate!  <br/><br/>* Share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and your blog or on email to your friends. <br/><br/>* Do you know someone who writes about peace, anti-nuclear protests, history, Quakers, the Pacific Ocean, wooden boats, sailboat restoration or sailing? Encourage them to contact us for a story.<br/><br/>* Hold a pledge party, where a computer is available for people to create accounts and pledge on the spot. <br/><br/>* Pledge in someone's honor as a gift to them.<br/><br/>* Do you know any celebrities who might support the <i>Golden Rule</i>'s mission? Encourage them to lend their name and support to our fundraiser.</p><p>From the bottom of our hearts, thank you! Even if you can't contribute now, the <i>Golden Rule</i> is always available for personal tours if you're in the Eureka, CA area. Contact us through our website,  <a href=""http://vfpgoldenruleproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://vfpgoldenruleproject.org/</a> and we'll show you around. But, fair warning: once people see the boat, they become easily seduced by the beauty of the vessel and the dedication of the fun-loving characters who make up the project. Many soon find themselves sanding, painting, sweeping up or fundraising with us. </p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Who We Are  </b></p><p></p><p>Although the <i>Golden Rule</i> Project receives support from a diverse collection of people and groups, Veterans For Peace is our sponsoring organization.  We share common values and goals, and most Golden Rule Committee members belong to Veterans For Peace.  </p><p>We are committed to ending arms races and abolishing nuclear weapons, illuminating the true costs of war, and finally abolishing war as an instrument of national policy.  </p><p>The Golden Rule Project and Veterans For Peace are equally concerned about the state of the environment, and the impact upon it of military activities.

In 1958, her brave crew of Quakers and pacifists risked their lives and freedom to nonviolently confront nuclear testing on the high seas. With your help, we'll be able to honor their legacy and continue their mission. The StoryHorrified by the ongoing, open-air nuclear bomb tests and the threat of nuclear war, the four-man crew sailed the Golden Rule from California toward the Marshall Islands. Their intention, publicized around the world, was to nonviolently place their bodies in the way of planned nuclear bomb blasts. As they sailed from Honolulu harbor for the testing area, the voyagers were stopped and arrested by the U.S. Coast Guard. Guided by their conscience, the crew attempted to sail again, were arrested once more and detained in the Honolulu city jail until the conclusion of the test cycle. The LegacyThe publicity surrounding their trial and imprisonment helped ignite public outrage against nuclear weapons testing and alerted the world to the health hazards of nuclear fallout. Five years and many protests later, the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963 was enacted, banning above-ground nuclear testing by the two Superpowers. The courageous voyage of the Golden Rule and her crew inspired a similar anti-nuclear voyage in 1971 by the group that would eventually become Greenpeace. After the Golden Rule's crew was released from jail in 1958, the boat was sold. Many owners and half a century later, it ended up in northern California's Humboldt Bay, neglected and damaged, finally sinking in a storm.  The Golden Rule can continue to be an inspiration for the protection of the environment and active peacemaking.  But first, we've got to get her back in the water.The Golden Rule ProjectWhen the Vets For Peace learned that this irreplaceable icon of history had literally washed up on their doorstep, they formed the Golden Rule Project and set about the restoration of both the boat and her mission.With the gracious help of many talented volunteers and generous donations from around the world, the restoration is 70% complete. But, to get the Golden Rule back on the water now requires some large capital expenses like sails, electronic navigation equipment and specialized labor. Join The CrewOur $50,000 goal will cover these costs, allowing us to “splash” in 2014.The sooner we raise this money, the sooner the Golden Rule will be able to set sail on her new mission as a living museum and floating classroom, educating future generations on the importance of the ocean environment, the risks of nuclear technology and the need for world peace.  By donating to this project, you become a part of the Golden Rule's extended crew, helping to unfurl the sails of peace everywhere.  Please step up, step aboard and help us launch the dream.The PerksBesides knowing that you're an integral part of this important piece of peace history, your monetary contribution will get you all sorts of cool tokens of appreciation. Join us for sea trials aboard the reborn Golden Rule as we remake history. Become an official Plank Owner. Have your name engraved on a permanent brass plaque aboard the boat. Score some fantastic bling. And lots more. Check the giving levels and pick your favorite. Every bit helps and no contribution is too small.Can't contribute cash?  There are lots of other ways to participate!  * Share our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and your blog or on email to your friends. * Do you know someone who writes about peace, anti-nuclear protests, history, Quakers, the Pacific Ocean, wooden boats, sailboat restoration or sailing? Encourage them to contact us for a story.* Hold a pledge party, where a computer is available for people to create accounts and pledge on the spot. * Pledge in someone's honor as a gift to them.* Do you know any celebrities who might support the Golden Rule's mission? Encourage them to lend their name and support to our fundraiser.From the bottom of our hearts, thank you! Even if you can't contribute now, the Golden Rule is always available for personal tours if you're in the Eureka, CA area. Contact us through our website,  http://vfpgoldenruleproject.org/ and we'll show you around. But, fair warning: once people see the boat, they become easily seduced by the beauty of the vessel and the dedication of the fun-loving characters who make up the project. Many soon find themselves sanding, painting, sweeping up or fundraising with us. Who We Are  Although the Golden Rule Project receives support from a diverse collection of people and groups, Veterans For Peace is our sponsoring organization.  We share common values and goals, and most Golden Rule Committee members belong to Veterans For Peace.  We are committed to ending arms races and abolishing nuclear weapons, illuminating the true costs of war, and finally abolishing war as an instrument of national policy.  The Golden Rule Project and Veterans For Peace are equally concerned about the state of the environment, and the impact upon it of military activities. In fact, we see peacemaking and the environment as being inextricably intertwined. After all, the U.S. Department of Defense is the world's number one polluter.  We are likewise fully committed to the use of nonviolent means. The Quaker-inspired original crew of the Golden Rule pioneered the use of nonviolent direct action, and the restored boat will proudly carry that message.  The Golden Rule Project is also supported by a number of Quakers, as was the original voyage, along with many other people of faith.  A number of Humboldt County businesses have been most generous with their support.  Lots of peace people and historic wooden boat lovers are behind us as well. We are particularly gratified that Greenpeace, USA is on board.  It makes sense - we share common values, and after all, the Golden Rule is the Rainbow Warrior's granny!  Much more information is available at our website,  http://vfpgoldenruleproject.org/",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/112913/files/20131004093350-obalogo.png?1380904430"" src="""" style=""width: 168.31020408163263px; height: 169px;""/></b></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>What we want</b></p>
<p>To stop the recent serious decline in bee population in Ontario</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Why we want to do that </b></p>
<p>Neonicotinoid pesticides have been confirmed by Health Canada to be the cause of recent bee kills in Ontario and Quebec in both 2012 and 2013. We want Ontario to <b>suspend</b> the use of these pesticides on field crops in Ontario pending further study, <b>just as Europe has done</b>. Bees and beekeepers cannot survive another year of pesticide applications. </p>
<p>Please, listen to this <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/ontariomorning/episodes/2013/09/10/no-ban-on-pesticide-that-may-kill-bees/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CBC radio interview</a> which contains an emotional plea by Ontario beekeeper Dave Shuitt to understand the gravity of this issue.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>How we want to do that</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We want to create a, short, powerful documentary film about a third-generation Ontario beekeeper named Tom Congdon. Tom will tell his story in a way that puts a human face on the problem of the recent losses of bees . We hope his story, shared widely, will increase public pressure on provincial legislators to suspend the use of neonicotinoid. And we need them to understand the consequences of not banning these toxins before the end of this year to have untreated corn available for the next planting season. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The Ask </b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We need petition signatures and letters to MPP’s and the Premier. We’re fighting worldwide lobbying efforts by multinational pesticide corporations like Bayer and Syngenta.  So we need your help raising money to make a short documentary video about the deadly effect neonicotinoid pesticides are having on bee populations. The petition to ban these pesticides in Ontario already has 50,000+ signatures, but we need <b>many, many more people</b> to voice their support for Ontario bees and beekeepers. </span></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The Documentary </b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You probably already know that bees are a vital pillar of the ecosystem  and without them, the whole food chain is at risk of collapse. You probably know that their numbers are in perilous decline . You might even have heard that neonicotinoids are a major cause of declining bee populations. But not everyone knows this. That's why we want to get the word out. That's why we want to create a compelling, short, shareable documentary video that <b>gets the public motivated</b> to support the suspension of neonicotinoid pesticides. </span></p>
<p>We know that there are many factors contributing to declining bee populations, from bee pests, disease increased urbanization to climate change. The point is, neonicotinoids are weakening colonies making them more susceptible to these causes. These systemic pesticides are also contaminating our soil and our water. And suspending their use is something we <b>can</b> and <b>must</b> do. We've got an opportunity to take action. <b>We know what we need to do, we just need to convince our elected representatives that they must take action</b> if they are to save our bees and preserve so much of our local food that relies on bees for pollination. </p>
<p><b>Premier Wynne</b>, who is also our Minister of Agriculture, will be making a decision about the continued use of neonicotinoids <b>very soon</b>.  We want to <b>make sure she knows that this is an issue their constituents care about</b>. We're concerned that if there isn't enough support for suspending it's use, the Premier will accede to the powerful lobbying being done by agribusiness interests: Bayer, the Grain Farmers of Ontario and others who profit from the continued overuse and application of these pesticides. <b>We need to get the real story and facts out there by any means</b>.  </p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;""><i>""My grandfather started this business in 1916, right here in this house. My father still helps out with the bees sometimes. He’s 74, and that’s what he loves, interacting with the bees. Back when he was younger, in the 1960’s, they had a similar problem with a phosphate-based pesticide named Alderin. It decimated the bee populations so badly that he had to buy out another beekeeper up in Wellington County to stay in business. The pesticide was eventually withdrawn from use after it turned up in tomatoes on the shelves of supermarkets.""</i><br/></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">We intend to seed the short video on social networks using all of our partner organizations to get the word out. We want to use the video to drive people to sign our online petition and to commit to writing a letter to their MPs and MPPs. We understand that parliament and the Ontario legislature don't pay that much attention to online petitions, but do get motivated by real, physical letters. So, as we establish online signatures, we'll ask people to print sign and mail real letters to their local elected officials.

The Ontario Beekeepers Association




What we want
To stop the recent serious decline in bee population in Ontario

Why we want to do that 
Neonicotinoid pesticides have been confirmed by Health Canada to be the cause of recent bee kills in Ontario and Quebec in both 2012 and 2013. We want Ontario to suspend the use of these pesticides on field crops in Ontario pending further study, just as Europe has done. Bees and beekeepers cannot survive another year of pesticide applications. 
Please, listen to this CBC radio interview which contains an emotional plea by Ontario beekeeper Dave Shuitt to understand the gravity of this issue.

How we want to do that
We want to create a, short, powerful documentary film about a third-generation Ontario beekeeper named Tom Congdon. Tom will tell his story in a way that puts a human face on the problem of the recent losses of bees . We hope his story, shared widely, will increase public pressure on provincial legislators to suspend the use of neonicotinoid. And we need them to understand the consequences of not banning these toxins before the end of this year to have untreated corn available for the next planting season. 



The Ask 
We need petition signatures and letters to MPP’s and the Premier. We’re fighting worldwide lobbying efforts by multinational pesticide corporations like Bayer and Syngenta.  So we need your help raising money to make a short documentary video about the deadly effect neonicotinoid pesticides are having on bee populations. The petition to ban these pesticides in Ontario already has 50,000+ signatures, but we need many, many more people to voice their support for Ontario bees and beekeepers. 

The Documentary 
You probably already know that bees are a vital pillar of the ecosystem  and without them, the whole food chain is at risk of collapse. You probably know that their numbers are in perilous decline . You might even have heard that neonicotinoids are a major cause of declining bee populations. But not everyone knows this. That's why we want to get the word out. That's why we want to create a compelling, short, shareable documentary video that gets the public motivated to support the suspension of neonicotinoid pesticides. 
We know that there are many factors contributing to declining bee populations, from bee pests, disease increased urbanization to climate change. The point is, neonicotinoids are weakening colonies making them more susceptible to these causes. These systemic pesticides are also contaminating our soil and our water. And suspending their use is something we can and must do. We've got an opportunity to take action. We know what we need to do, we just need to convince our elected representatives that they must take action if they are to save our bees and preserve so much of our local food that relies on bees for pollination. 
Premier Wynne, who is also our Minister of Agriculture, will be making a decision about the continued use of neonicotinoids very soon.  We want to make sure she knows that this is an issue their constituents care about. We're concerned that if there isn't enough support for suspending it's use, the Premier will accede to the powerful lobbying being done by agribusiness interests: Bayer, the Grain Farmers of Ontario and others who profit from the continued overuse and application of these pesticides. We need to get the real story and facts out there by any means.  

This is Tom Congdon



Here's Tom being interviewed by the CBC. 
He's a third-generation beekeeper. He's witnessed first-hand the effect that neonicotinoids are having on bees, and both he and many prominent scientists agree, these pesticides are killing bees worldwide. Ever since their introduction, 70% of the tested bees tested positive for traces of the pesticide.
The European Union has suspended the use of neonicotinoids pending further study. We want Canada to do the same, and we'd like to start right here in Ontario. 
Here's a quick excerpt of a talk we had with Tom recently:
""My grandfather started this business in 1916, right here in this house. My father still helps out with the bees sometimes. He’s 74, and that’s what he loves, interacting with the bees. Back when he was younger, in the 1960’s, they had a similar problem with a phosphate-based pesticide named Alderin. It decimated the bee populations so badly that he had to buy out another beekeeper up in Wellington County to stay in business. The pesticide was eventually withdrawn from use after it turned up in tomatoes on the shelves of supermarkets.""
-Tom Congdon, 3rd Generation Ontario Beekeeper


How We'll Use The Documentary
We intend to seed the short video on social networks using all of our partner organizations to get the word out. We want to use the video to drive people to sign our online petition and to commit to writing a letter to their MPs and MPPs. We understand that parliament and the Ontario legislature don't pay that much attention to online petitions, but do get motivated by real, physical letters. So, as we establish online signatures, we'll ask people to print sign and mail real letters to their local elected officials. We're confident that if we can get a 500 hundred or so letters in each riding, this will become an issue the politicians cannot ignore. 


How the money will be spent
We've found some talented filmmakers who've agreed to work at minimal cost to make this video. We've got a few respected marketing professionals volunteering on this project. We have musicians ready to score the piece at cost. We estimate, to make a truly beautiful, compelling, touching and motivating video, we need somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000.  
Indigogo's take is 9%, so we're setting the goal at $20,000. 
Anything that comes in after that will be used to (in order)


Promote the video and petition
Invest in more research into the chronic effects of neonicotinoids

If we don't reach our goal but come close, we'll try to raise the difference elsewhere, or we'll channel this funding straight into promotion of the petition and more research

Urgency
Premier Wynne will be meeting with her advisors and her caucus soon.  so we've got to have something wrapped up and out there for the public to get excited about well before that. Even more pressing, as the weather gets colder the bees will not be flying.  If we want to collect any footage of Tom working with his hives in-situ, we need to move quickly.

<p> </p>
<p>Our debt is steadily mounting, and it has now topped $50,000.  I have tried repeatedly to get a job, but I can't find anything that will allow me to work while my kids are at school, and day care for special needs children is non-existent in this area.  They require one-on-one, round-the-clock care.  Though we live below poverty level, we have never accepted help from the government.  I am only asking for help now as an emergency.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We live very meagerly; we only eat out once at month (at McDonald's) and my husband and I NEVER go out.  We have 2 vehicles, both of which are from the year 2000.  We plan to drive both of those into the ground.  We do not have fancy clothes or fancy furniture.  We still use most of the furniture we had when we got married.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am begging for this help for my family; you can't imagine the burden it would lift off my family to able to update our home to make it safe and healthy for our children.  I would do anything for my children, but we live on my husband's income and we just don't have any extra to put into our home.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for any help you can give us.  I pray that you will find us worthy of help.  Bless you.</p></div>","I am a stay-at-home mother living in the small town of Sandwich, Illinois.  My husband, Bob, and I have been married 23 years.  We have 4 children; Scott, age 16, Ethan, age 13, Claire, age 11, and Joey, age 9.  When Ethan was 3, he was diagnosed with severe autism.  After Claire and Joey were born, they were both diagnosed with autism around the same age.

<p><b><i>The average household contains
about 62 toxic chemicals, say environmental experts. We’re exposed to them

oven cleaners. Ingredients in common household products have been linked to
asthma, cancer, reproductive disorders, hormone disruption and neurotoxicity.</i></b></p>

<b><i><br/></i></b><p></p>
<p><b><i>Manufacturers argue that in
small amounts these toxic ingredients aren’t likely to be a problem, but when
we’re exposed to them routinely, and in combinations that haven’t been studied,
it’s impossible to accurately gauge the risks. While a few products cause
immediate reactions from acute exposure (headaches from fumes, skin burns from
accidental contact), different problems arise with repeated contact. Chronic
exposure adds to the body’s “toxic burden” — the number of chemicals stored in
its tissues at a given time.</i></b></p>

Beware
of unregulated ""greenwash"" claims on labels! Terms such as
""natural"" and ""eco-friendly"" shouldn't be equated with
safety unless they're backed up with specific ingredient information, such as
""solvent-free,"" ""no petroleum-based ingredients,"" ""no
phosphates,"" etc. ""Non-toxic"" has no official definition, so
unless a third party has verified this claim, it is not considered meaningful.
And don't believe ""organic"" ingredients in cleaning and other
chemical products are any safer than other substances. Although
""organic"" in the grocery store refers to foods grown without
synthetic pesticides, in chemistry it refers to chemicals that are
carbon-based, including some VOCs (volatile organic compounds) that release
harmful fumes and may cause brain damage or cancer.Additionally, watch out for
products labeled organic. </i></b></p>

<p>""Lorem Artis"" is the first, and so far the only producer of natural cleaning products in Croatia.

Each product has a document that proves the ingredients in the product. (MSD,SDS,PSDS)


All our products are made by hand, HOME MADE, and are completely natural, and so they can not harm your health, protect your children from allergic reactions and difficulty breathing. Our products are entirely made ​​from natural resources such as: fruit lemon, salt, citric acid, alcohol vinegar, essential oils and food colors. For our products we have documentation that confirms all compositions that are listed.


The average household contains
about 62 toxic chemicals, say environmental experts. We’re exposed to them
routinely — from the phthalates in synthetic fragrances to the noxious fumes in
oven cleaners. Ingredients in common household products have been linked to
asthma, cancer, reproductive disorders, hormone disruption and neurotoxicity.



Manufacturers argue that in
small amounts these toxic ingredients aren’t likely to be a problem, but when
we’re exposed to them routinely, and in combinations that haven’t been studied,
it’s impossible to accurately gauge the risks. While a few products cause
immediate reactions from acute exposure (headaches from fumes, skin burns from
accidental contact), different problems arise with repeated contact. Chronic
exposure adds to the body’s “toxic burden” — the number of chemicals stored in
its tissues at a given time.





Beware
of unregulated ""greenwash"" claims on labels! Terms such as
""natural"" and ""eco-friendly"" shouldn't be equated with
safety unless they're backed up with specific ingredient information, such as
""solvent-free,"" ""no petroleum-based ingredients,"" ""no
phosphates,"" etc. ""Non-toxic"" has no official definition, so
unless a third party has verified this claim, it is not considered meaningful.
And don't believe ""organic"" ingredients in cleaning and other
chemical products are any safer than other substances. Although
""organic"" in the grocery store refers to foods grown without
synthetic pesticides, in chemistry it refers to chemicals that are
carbon-based, including some VOCs (volatile organic compounds) that release
harmful fumes and may cause brain damage or cancer.Additionally, watch out for
products labeled organic. 


""Lorem Artis"" is the first, and so far the only producer of natural cleaning products in Croatia. It was founded with the aim to better inform people and prove to them that for a clean home is not necessary to use harsh chemicals that harm to people and the environment. Cleaners working on own recipes, which are formed as a product of research after a family member got an allergic reaction to cleaning chemicals.Products are suitable for people with allergies, asthma, and of course, all those who do not want use harmful chemicals in your home.We have the resources needed so that we may place our products throughout our country,and in some beautifull dreams in the rest of the world.
Our products are:  1. cleaning glass surfaces, lavender, lemon, orange
                               2. universal toilet sanitary cleaner- lemon
                               3. lemon gel for dishwasher, and also universal cleaner

Molokai, the ""real"" Hawaii nobody knows. 65 miles and a world away from Honolulu. Home to our country's longest fringing reef system and the world's highest sea cliffs. A population of just 7,000 people - with over <a href=""http://d3c8esugncvql9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Molokai_Stats1.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">60% identifying as native Hawaiian </a>- but with the <a href=""uhfamily.hawaii.edu/Cof_Data/profiles/narrative.asp?geo=11500910865"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">highest rates of poverty and unemployment in the state</a>.

<b>Molokai has one of highest rates of extinction in the world.</b> It makes up less than 0.1% of U.S. land, but has over 25% of the plants and animals found on the nation's endangered species list. Because the Hawaiian archipelago is so geographically isolated, new species were introduced at a rate of only one every 100,000 years. But with the arrival of man - and especially Europeans - scientists estimate new species are being introduced at 2 million times the natural rate. As a result, native species are under constant threat from aggressive non-native species, such as the kiawe tree, a thorny relative of the mesquite native to Peru. In 1828 a single tree was planted in Honolulu. Today, it dominates the lowland ecosystems of all the islands, but especially Molokai, where it's out-competing native vegetation at an alarming rate. </li></ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1139299/files/20150108222620-Molokai_Land_Trust__1_of_1_-Edit-Edit-2-Edit.jpg?1420784780"" src="""" style=""""/></p><ul><li>

<b>Molokai's Native Hawaiian population faces severe economic challenges. </b>Unemployment on the island is almost double the statewide average, and the per capita income is among the lowest in the state. <a href=""uhfamily.hawaii.edu/Cof_Data/profiles/narrative.asp?geo=11500910865"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Molokai also has the highest percentage of young children living in poverty.</a> Hawaiians on the island have adapted by returning to their cultural roots, practicing traditional and sustainable substance fishing, farming and hunting to survive.</li></ul><ul><li>

In 2010, MLT's staff discovered a single specimen of the endangered ohai plant which had not been documented in the area for a 100 years. From this one plant, we were able to successfully cultivate and reestablish a new population of ohai on the preserve. Today 136 specimens thrive on the site and over 300 seedlings are ready to be replanted from our nursery stock.</li></ul><ul>

The valley is rich in cultural history as the site of an ancient and extensive taro loi complex, with sites scattered throughout the lower watershed.

<ul><li> <b>We carefully manage traditional subsistence activities</b> such as forest gathering, la'au lapa'au (traditional Hawaiian herbal healing), hunting and fishing.</li></ul>

<b>Our habitat restoration projects are highly successful.</b> We aggressively clear out non-native vegetation, reintroduced entire native plant ecosystems all at once from seedlings we propagate in our own nurseries, then protect the projects with extensive fencing, remove non-native predators, and carefully monitor the progress of each reestablished habitat.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>We've partnered with the Molokai public schools</b> on environmental science and service learning projects. Our goal is to give every child on Molokai the opportunity to create their own connection with the land as the kapuna (elders) did generations ago.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b>We've partnered with AmeriCorp</b> to offer paid internships to local and native youth, bringing much needed employment to Molokai while providing valuable work experience in conservation and land management techniques.</li></ul>

<b>We respect the vision of Molokai's kupuna (elders) </b>and work directly with them to preserve, protect and perpetuate core Hawaiian values.

Molokai, the ""real"" Hawaii nobody knows. 65 miles and a world away from Honolulu. Home to our country's longest fringing reef system and the world's highest sea cliffs. A population of just 7,000 people - with over 60% identifying as native Hawaiian - but with the highest rates of poverty and unemployment in the state. An island lost in time and in a race against environmental and cultural extinction.
Molokai has one of highest rates of extinction in the world. It makes up less than 0.1% of U.S. land, but has over 25% of the plants and animals found on the nation's endangered species list. Because the Hawaiian archipelago is so geographically isolated, new species were introduced at a rate of only one every 100,000 years. But with the arrival of man - and especially Europeans - scientists estimate new species are being introduced at 2 million times the natural rate. As a result, native species are under constant threat from aggressive non-native species, such as the kiawe tree, a thorny relative of the mesquite native to Peru. In 1828 a single tree was planted in Honolulu. Today, it dominates the lowland ecosystems of all the islands, but especially Molokai, where it's out-competing native vegetation at an alarming rate. 
Every year thousands of tons of topsoil smother Molokai's precious reef system, erosion caused by the human introduction of cattle, goats, deer, pigs, sugar cane, and pineapple.
Molokai's Native Hawaiian population faces severe economic challenges. Unemployment on the island is almost double the statewide average, and the per capita income is among the lowest in the state. Molokai also has the highest percentage of young children living in poverty. Hawaiians on the island have adapted by returning to their cultural roots, practicing traditional and sustainable substance fishing, farming and hunting to survive.
Molokai is under intense development pressure from international corporations which offer little beyond minimum wage work in exchange for paving over a vast array of cultural, archaeological, subsistence, environmental, agricultural, and recreational resources. For a community which does not view land as a commodity but rather as the foundation of their identity as Hawaiians, time is of the essence to develop viable, environmentally sensitive and sustainable economic alternatives.

WHAT IS THE MOLOKAI LAND TRUST?
In 2006, The Molakai Land Trust was formed as a non-profit community-based organization with a mission to conserve the island’s precious lands and return them to their natural state, protecting its unique diversity and cultural heritage for future generations. As a 501(c)(3) organization, all donations to the Molokai Land Trust are tax deductible!Molokai Land Trust owns or manages nearly 3,000 acres of native wilderness.
Mokio Preserve - This 1,718 acre parcel on the dry, northwestern part of Molokai contains approximately 5 miles of rugged shoreline, remnant native coastal strand and dune ecosystems, a seasonal wetland, and several ancient Hawaiian sites, including an adze quarry and the remnants of a seasonal housing complex. In 2010, MLT's staff discovered a single specimen of the endangered ohai plant which had not been documented in the area for a 100 years. From this one plant, we were able to successfully cultivate and reestablish a new population of ohai on the preserve. Today 136 specimens thrive on the site and over 300 seedlings are ready to be replanted from our nursery stock.

Kawaikapu Preserve - In 2009, MLT purchased  the 196.4 acre Kawaikapu Ranch located on the wet, southeast part of Molokai. This environmentally and culturally significant land purchase stretches from sea level up to 1600 feet. The valley is rich in cultural history as the site of an ancient and extensive taro loi complex, with sites scattered throughout the lower watershed. Protected in perpetuity from development, Kawaikapu represents an opportunity to work with local residents to nurture the native plants used for cultural purposes, manage subsistence gathering, and reestablish and protect the native forest.

Mo'omomi Preserve - The 921-acre Mo'omomi Preserve is the most intact coastal beach strand and sand dune area in the main Hawaiian Islands.  Owned by The Nature Conservancy, MLT was contracted in 2010 to assist them with stewardship activities in the preserve. By protecting the dunes and beaches of Mo'omomi, MLT is safeguarding native plants found nowhere else on earth, as well as criticial endangered species habitat and nesting sites for the rare Hawaiian owl, Hawaiian monk seals, seabird nesting colonies for the wedge-tailed shearwater, and endangered green sea turtles.





WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT?

The Molokai Land Trust recognizes and values the priceless resources right here within our own community on Molokai. We know that without community support, our organization can't take on the important work necessary to preserve and restore the cultural and natural resources that make Molokai so unique. So we work proactively to create opportunities for local residents and groups to interact with the land and sustainably use its resources in traditional ways.
 We carefully manage traditional subsistence activities such as forest gathering, la'au lapa'au (traditional Hawaiian herbal healing), hunting and fishing.

Our habitat restoration projects are highly successful. We aggressively clear out non-native vegetation, reintroduced entire native plant ecosystems all at once from seedlings we propagate in our own nurseries, then protect the projects with extensive fencing, remove non-native predators, and carefully monitor the progress of each reestablished habitat.

We've partnered with the Molokai public schools on environmental science and service learning projects. Our goal is to give every child on Molokai the opportunity to create their own connection with the land as the kapuna (elders) did generations ago.

We've partnered with AmeriCorp to offer paid internships to local and native youth, bringing much needed employment to Molokai while providing valuable work experience in conservation and land management techniques.

We respect the vision of Molokai's kupuna (elders) and work directly with them to preserve, protect and perpetuate core Hawaiian values. We envision a wise and caring community that takes pride in its resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and resiliency, and is firmly in charge of Moloka'i resources and destiny.

This year we have our eyes set on:BIG BETS+ Launching XL Hemp, the mobile airstream accelerator pushing ideas and awareness for the possibilities and financial opportunities of hemp+ Seeding a 5-acre hemp fieldSMALL BETS+ Producing Big Hemp branded apparel, stickers, and clothing+ Partnering with brands to help bring the Big Hemp vision to life+ An ad campaign to create demand for Montana-grown hemp+ Funding for the continued development of hemp products+ Grants for projects that come out of the Montana State University hemp class+ Hemp seed funding for farmersTogether, we’re building a sustainable industry and bringing more and more innovative hemp solutions to the food, textile, fuel, and construction markets. And when you back Big Hemp you continue to aid Montana’s hemp infrastructure. The ImpactThe CBD industry alone is expected to reach more than $20 billion in the next five years. That’s $20 billion for just one part of the hemp plant. The entire plant has more than 25,000 uses ranging from concrete and plastics to bread and clothing to oil and footwear.Imagine if we grew, processed, and manufactured hemp for more than just CBD oil, the industry would be exponentially more valuable. Risks & ChallengesToday, Montana grows more acres of hemp than anywhere else in the US. And the single barrier between hemp being a natural resource synonymous with sustainability and versatility is infrastructure.By driving demand for hemp through micro-projects that showcase its capabilities, we can create a market for hemp and bring the industry back to the US. Other Ways You Can HelpWant to do even more for Big Hemp?

<p>The remarkable
river with a common name, California's Smith River draws anglers from far away
for a chance at its wild salmon and steelhead. Geology and location result in a
unique river, draining from the Siskiyou Mountains and the Coast Range. While
elsewhere, Northern California's Coast range represents the Franciscan
Formation, primarily sandstone, here it more closely aligns with the geology of
the Klamath Mountains. Ultramafic rock appears as the oceanic crust collides
with the continental crust, resulting in the surface appearance of ancient
oceanic serpentine rock.</p>
<p>Steep canyons,
combined with heavy rainfall (in some areas, over 200 inches per year), scour
these bedrock gorges. The river rises fast, yet recedes just as quickly. Very
little sediment is carried by the Smith, resulting in the remarkable jade green
and sapphire blues of water so clear, you might be inclined to jump off the
drift boat and wade to shore. As one nameless person on our trip discovered,
the Big Gulp is a simple step away.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431033246/fyshreh4mhtmy6bbaijj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Smith River has

an entire watershed can be protected. Here there are no dams, no wretched

<div><br/></div>
<h2>Impacts of LNG development</h2>
<p>In addition to the threat to salmon, LNG pipelines and terminals also threaten to drastically increase coastal air pollution, and to fragment 900 km of wildlife and fish habitat, as well as gathering and hunting grounds.  </p>
<p>The projects will rely on thousands of mostly non-local temporary workers, which will bring increased violence, drug trafficking, soaring living costs, prostitution and social disfunction to our communities, as has occurred in other oil and gas ""boom"" communities like Ft. St. John and Ft. McMurray. </p>
<p>Our communities do not need these influences.</p>
<div>Moreover, if the PRGT pipeline is built, it may one day be converted to carry oil. TransCanada is already planning to convert an old gas pipeline into their Energy East Pipeline. Global uncertainty in the LNG market make this a real possibility for the PRGT pipeline as well. <p></p>
<p>We are unanimously opposed to transporting bitumen pipelines across Madii 'Lii Territory.</p>
<h2>Trespassing on Madii Lii Territory</h2>
<p>About 32 km of TransCanada's proposed PRGT pipeline is proposed to trespass our Madii Lii Territory from Suskwa Pass to the Shegunia River, 16 km of which will destroy the Babine Trail, the ancestral grease trail connecting Gitanmaax with Fort Babine. </p>
<p>The members of Wilps Luutkudziiwus have never ceded, surrendered, or treated their Madii Lii Territory. If the PRGT pipeline is built, there will be direct and indirect impacts to Luutkudziiwus rights and title, include adverse effects to fish, wildlife, terrestrial and aquatic resources, including cumulative effects, as well as to social, cultural, and economic values. The proposed PRGT pipeline project is in deep conflict with core Luutkudziiwus interests and values. </p>
<p>Neither government nor industry has consulted with the house of Luutkudziiwus during their proposals of these projects. </p>

What we need now
We are fundraising for our first Winter Occupation of Madii Lii Territory. This will allow us to prevent TransCanada from beginning construction of their LNG pipeline on Jan. 15, 2015.

We are aiming to raise $20 000, which will allow us to occupy, control, and keep watch over Madii Lii from now until summer 2015.

100% of the funds raised will be used for:


Completion of the cabin (insulation, heating, wiring, finishing).
Basecamp supplies (back-up generator, back-up chainsaw, bridge survielance cameras, fire wood, food)
Transportation (snowmobile, fuel)
24-hr basecamp occupation and territory monitoring (field excursions, etc.)
Communications (satelite communications, media relations, First Nations Unity Summit hosting at Madii Lii)

With your support, Madii Lii members will ensure that TransCanada misses not only their Jan. 15, 2015 date for shovels in the ground, but that they never build their pipeline at all.

Stand with Madii Lii for Skeena Salmon, for Indigenous rights, and for genuine long-term sustainability.

Thank you!

More about our project:


Read our reasons for opposing LNG pipelines and terminals at MadiiLii.com

Impacts of LNG development
In addition to the threat to salmon, LNG pipelines and terminals also threaten to drastically increase coastal air pollution, and to fragment 900 km of wildlife and fish habitat, as well as gathering and hunting grounds.  
The projects will rely on thousands of mostly non-local temporary workers, which will bring increased violence, drug trafficking, soaring living costs, prostitution and social disfunction to our communities, as has occurred in other oil and gas ""boom"" communities like Ft. St. John and Ft. McMurray. 
Our communities do not need these influences.
Moreover, if the PRGT pipeline is built, it may one day be converted to carry oil. TransCanada is already planning to convert an old gas pipeline into their Energy East Pipeline. Global uncertainty in the LNG market make this a real possibility for the PRGT pipeline as well. 
We are unanimously opposed to transporting bitumen pipelines across Madii 'Lii Territory.
Trespassing on Madii Lii Territory
About 32 km of TransCanada's proposed PRGT pipeline is proposed to trespass our Madii Lii Territory from Suskwa Pass to the Shegunia River, 16 km of which will destroy the Babine Trail, the ancestral grease trail connecting Gitanmaax with Fort Babine. 
The members of Wilps Luutkudziiwus have never ceded, surrendered, or treated their Madii Lii Territory. If the PRGT pipeline is built, there will be direct and indirect impacts to Luutkudziiwus rights and title, include adverse effects to fish, wildlife, terrestrial and aquatic resources, including cumulative effects, as well as to social, cultural, and economic values. The proposed PRGT pipeline project is in deep conflict with core Luutkudziiwus interests and values. 
Neither government nor industry has consulted with the house of Luutkudziiwus during their proposals of these projects.

It's a long story, but in short, Marin Horizon School is a private school down at the end of my street (with a 96% transient population.) They enjoy a very friendly relationship with the HVCA, a non-profit that manages and maintains the local Community Center.
A representative from Marin Horizon School worked with the DPW to apply for a Safe Routes to School grant for a sidewalk. In funding Cycle 8, the project was awarded $900,000.

I look forward to your support in this venture!*</b></p><p><b>Overview of My Project</b></p><p>My project, United We Stand: Saving Our Environment, aims to create a more environmentally educated public that feels morally driven to fight climate change and save our environment. This project will examine the obstacles hindering environmental action, restricting the implementation of environmental education, and beckoning Americans to remain indoors, as well as explore potential solutions to these challenges.</p><p><b>The Problem</b></p><p>We are experiencing progressively volatile weather, higher sea levels, and melting ice caps. In the midst of a warming climate, the National Environmental Education &amp; Training Foundation estimates that only 1 or 2 percent of Americans are environmentally literate—or the state of possessing the knowledge and understanding of environmental issues required to think about how their daily actions affect the environment.<a href=""#_ftn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></a> Furthermore, American children and many adults spend increasingly less time outdoors and more time indoors, thus losing a connection with and appreciation for nature—a consequence that Richard Louv coined as nature-deficit disorder in his book, <i>The Last Child in the Woods</i>.<a href=""#_ftn2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[2]</span></span></span></a> A Nature Conservancy poll revealed that only 10 percent of American teenagers spend time outdoors daily, and researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health discovered that American adults spend less than 5 percent of their day in their vehicles and even less time outdoors.<a href=""#_ftn3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[3]</span></span></span></a></p><p>Although both Democrats and Republicans share some concern for our natural world, the environment has become a polarizing subject in an atmosphere dominated by party-politics. Thus, Congress has taken very little environmental action over the last several years. Although most states have adopted an environmental literacy plan, Millennials ages 18-34—the people who benefited from these plans in school—possess lower rates of environmental literacy than do adults ages 35-64.<a href=""#_ftn4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[4]</span></span></span></a> Generally, children especially know and care little about the environment, although they do value wildlife and nature.<a href=""#_ftn5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[5]</span></span></span></a> Additionally, women tend to support environmental initiatives and causes over economic ones (while the opposite is true of men), but men are far more environmentally literate than are women. Thus, a disconnection exists between environmental literacy and willingness to support environmental causes actively.<a href=""#_ftn6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[6]</span></span></span></a></p><p><b>My Plan</b></p><p>My project proposes that, in order to establish a public united in the battle to save our environment, we need to connect environmental literacy, nature-deficit disorder, and a method of imparting moral value to the environment, whether through targeted political messages<a href=""#_ftn7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span><span>[7]</span></span></span></a> or some other method. We also need to address the reason for the gender and age gaps in environmental literacy and environmental action. After completing the MTP, I hope to create my own organization, with my MTP project as its central focus. Thus, my MTP will help me formulate, explore, and refine a blueprint for the organization and career that I wish to create.</p><p><b>The MTP Journey</b></p><p>I hope to get on board the second MTP train, from August 10-18. In each city, I will meet with Millennials to brainstorm solutions to environmental issues and will hear their suggestions for accomplishing my project’s goal of an environmentally literate public that feels morally compelled to conserve our environment. Additionally, I will visit people working in organizations accomplishing similar goals and will explore their successes, their challenges, and what they believe are the most critical, unaddressed obstacles to achieving my project’s goal.</p><p>I hope to meet with some of the following organizations at each stop:</p><p>Los Angeles: <a href=""http://www.globalgreen.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Global Green, USA</a> / <a href=""http://www.sustainableworks.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sustainable Works</a></p><p>San Francisco: <a href=""http://www.earthteam.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EarthTeam</a> / <a href=""https://naturebridge.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NatureBridge</a></p><p>Denver: <a href=""http://www.thornenature.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Thorne Nature Experience</a> / <a href=""http://www.earthlinks-colorado.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EarthLinks</a></p><p>Milwaukee: <a href=""http://www.groundworkmke.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Groundwork Milwaukee</a> / <a href=""http://urbanecologycenter.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Urban Ecology Center</a> / <a href=""http://transitionmilwaukee.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Transition Milwaukee</a></p><p>Detroit: <a href=""https://www.voices4earth.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Voices for Earth Justice</a> / <a href=""http://www.sdevweb.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision</a> / <a href=""http://www.glbd.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Great Lakes Bioneers Detroit</a></p><p>I hope to expand and refine this list as my project progresses.

</div></div>","Thanks to the support of many generous individuals, I will be leaving in just two days for the Millennial Trains Project! I can't thank you all enough! You can follow my journey at: http://www.YOUnite4Environment.weebly.com. The Millennial Trains Project (MTP) is an award-winning 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that hosts one or two annual cross-country train rides for young, innovative entrepreneurs. The MTP has officially approved this campaign for the August 2016 journey.In order to get on board one of the two trains this August, I created a project to advance in each of the 5 cities along the journey and now need to be among the first 30 people to crowd-fund $5,000. I look forward to your support in this venture!*Overview of My ProjectMy project, United We Stand: Saving Our Environment, aims to create a more environmentally educated public that feels morally driven to fight climate change and save our environment. This project will examine the obstacles hindering environmental action, restricting the implementation of environmental education, and beckoning Americans to remain indoors, as well as explore potential solutions to these challenges.The ProblemWe are experiencing progressively volatile weather, higher sea levels, and melting ice caps. In the midst of a warming climate, the National Environmental Education & Training Foundation estimates that only 1 or 2 percent of Americans are environmentally literate—or the state of possessing the knowledge and understanding of environmental issues required to think about how their daily actions affect the environment.[1] Furthermore, American children and many adults spend increasingly less time outdoors and more time indoors, thus losing a connection with and appreciation for nature—a consequence that Richard Louv coined as nature-deficit disorder in his book, The Last Child in the Woods.[2] A Nature Conservancy poll revealed that only 10 percent of American teenagers spend time outdoors daily, and researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health discovered that American adults spend less than 5 percent of their day in their vehicles and even less time outdoors.[3]Although both Democrats and Republicans share some concern for our natural world, the environment has become a polarizing subject in an atmosphere dominated by party-politics. Thus, Congress has taken very little environmental action over the last several years. Although most states have adopted an environmental literacy plan, Millennials ages 18-34—the people who benefited from these plans in school—possess lower rates of environmental literacy than do adults ages 35-64.[4] Generally, children especially know and care little about the environment, although they do value wildlife and nature.[5] Additionally, women tend to support environmental initiatives and causes over economic ones (while the opposite is true of men), but men are far more environmentally literate than are women. Thus, a disconnection exists between environmental literacy and willingness to support environmental causes actively.[6]My PlanMy project proposes that, in order to establish a public united in the battle to save our environment, we need to connect environmental literacy, nature-deficit disorder, and a method of imparting moral value to the environment, whether through targeted political messages[7] or some other method. We also need to address the reason for the gender and age gaps in environmental literacy and environmental action. After completing the MTP, I hope to create my own organization, with my MTP project as its central focus. Thus, my MTP will help me formulate, explore, and refine a blueprint for the organization and career that I wish to create.The MTP JourneyI hope to get on board the second MTP train, from August 10-18. In each city, I will meet with Millennials to brainstorm solutions to environmental issues and will hear their suggestions for accomplishing my project’s goal of an environmentally literate public that feels morally compelled to conserve our environment. Additionally, I will visit people working in organizations accomplishing similar goals and will explore their successes, their challenges, and what they believe are the most critical, unaddressed obstacles to achieving my project’s goal.I hope to meet with some of the following organizations at each stop:Los Angeles: Global Green, USA / Sustainable WorksSan Francisco: EarthTeam / NatureBridgeDenver: Thorne Nature Experience / EarthLinksMilwaukee: Groundwork Milwaukee / The Urban Ecology Center / Transition MilwaukeeDetroit: Voices for Earth Justice / Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision / Great Lakes Bioneers DetroitI hope to expand and refine this list as my project progresses. In each city, I will take photographs and blog about the reception of and reactions to my project, as well as what I learned in each city. I will post the blog’s link for all of my supporters and post it on my social media pages so people can follow my project’s impact during my MTP journey.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to donate, please get the word out about my project! Post about it on social media and tell your friends and family. Every little bit helps! * Please note: All donations are tax-deductible. If I am among the first 30 people to be crowdfunded, all donations made to this campaign will go to the MTP to help underwrite the journey’s associated costs. However, if I am not among the first 30 people to be crowdfunded, my supporters will not be charged.

</h3><p>The Vaigai River Restoration Project is an international collaborative effort between US and Indian based organizations including <b>Earth Celebrations</b>, <b>Asia Initiatives</b>, and <b>DHAN Foundation</b>, along with local community, city,  state, and national officials, experts, academic institutions, and partner organizations to restore the Vaigai River in Madurai, India that is in a severe crisis due to pollution, waste dumping, and the drying effects of climate change. </p><p>The project incorporates a minimum 5-10 year plan, with a year-long cycle of creative civic engagement of organizations, academic institutions, government agencies, schools, and community. The project utilizes innovative methodologies developed over the past 25 years by Felicia Young, Founder/Executive Director of Earth Celebrations, applying local arts and cultural traditions, to inspire and build coalition efforts to develop solutions, impact policy, and create societal change on crucial environmental issues. Through stakeholder meetings, coalition efforts, educational workshops, environmental and cultural events, and a public social action art project, the community is inspired and mobilized to work together on a plan to mitigate contamination of the Vaigai River water supply and develop adaptation solutions to climate change.</p><p>The other innovation we are utilizing for the project is the concept of Social Capital Credit (SoCC), developed by Dr. Geeta Mehta, President of Asia Initiatives and Professor of Urban Studies and Architecture at Columbia University. SoCCs are a community currency of incentives people will earn by becoming custodians of the river, as well as for waste management and rain water harvesting which will help people improve their local environment and enable them to climb out of poverty. </p><div>
<p><b>Goals: </b></p>
<p>The goals of the project are achieved by building a city-wide grass-roots coalition effort that will: </p>

<p><b>Civic Engagement &amp; Cultural Strategies: </b></p>
<p>The project utilizes cultural strategies as a inspirational and creative method to mobilize grass-roots civic engagement of community people and build a diverse coalition of stakeholders working on this effort. The project engages residents of the urban and rural areas, youth, artists, performing groups, environmental scientists, academics, government officials, farmers, fishermen, and other groups that use the river, as well as government agencies, and environmental, cultural, religious, and academic institutions throughout the city. Through the process of creating a theatrical pageant highlighting the water, pollution, and climate crisis, stakeholders will mobilize an action campaign, and strengthen the coalition efforts to implement solutions for agriculture, safe drinking water, water storage, conservation, a sustainable urban renewal plan for Madurai.</p>

<b>Workshops &amp; Social Action Art</b><br/>
</div>
<div>The Vaigai River Restoration Project includes an Environmental &amp; Art Workshop Series that builds community engagement and awareness of the Vaigai River and issues of climate change for 3 months (January - April). Environmental educators engage participants to explore issues of water contamination, pollution, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, that provide the inspirational content for the visual art work created in the workshops. Local artisans specializing in various art, craft, performance, and folk traditions, engage community participants in the process of creating mobile sculptures, costumes, visual art, and performances highlighting the issues. A minimum of 100 workshops will be conducted at the Thiagarajar College,Tata/DHAN Academy, as well as other schools and institutions. Workshops will be offered free of cost to the community and engage many local organizations. The workshops and creative community and coalition building process culminates in the Vaigai River Restoration Pageant, a public procession of giant mobile sculptures, spectacular costumes, and musical bands with performances at significant sites along the river highlighting the issues and solutions. </div>

<div>The Vaigai River Restoration Project has come at a critical time to have an impact on the restoration of the Vaigai River is Madurai, Tamil Nadu, South India, and can also serve a global model for ecological and social change through the arts. Help Earth Celebrations get back to India for this important project that brings our creative environmental strategies, originally inspired by the pageantry and community engaged arts of India and Madurai, that we applied to our 15 year effort to preserve the community gardens of New York City and to the restoration of the Hudson River Estuary, now back to India and Madurai after 25 years to have an impact on a major local and global water crisis.</div>

<h4>January 2015 </h4>
<p>Felicia was back in Madurai to launch to the workshop series engaging students from Thiagarajar College of Engineering and Architecture, Tata/DHAN Academy, Vivekananda College, Fatima College, and a women's empowerment group. Students <span>explored the issues of pollution, sanitation and climate change affecting the health of the Vaigai River, and proposed ideas and solutions for river restoration and future plan for a river park along the Vaigai. They then generated designs for visual art projects and processional sculptures utilizing local folk art traditions representing these concepts that will be constructed in the workshops January - April for culminating public procession along the Vaigai River. Felicia also conducted meetings with local artisans and performers regarding workshop plans, design development, and generating new work representing the issues.</span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1254046/files/20150227093651-450240592.jpg?1425058611"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center; width: 653.0456852791879px; height: 830px;""/></p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p>The <b>Vaigai River Restoration Project</b> is an environmental social action project to mobilize community engagement and implement solutions to restore the Vaigai River and mitigate the severe crisis of water contamination, pollution, waste dumping, and adapt to the drying effects of climate change, affecting the drinking water, agriculture, and the survival of the people of Madurai, South India.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(144, 199, 64); font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px;""></span></p>
<p>Through the innovative and creative strategy and model of the<b> Vaigai River Restoration Project,</b> we will engage community participants in a grassroots educational and social action campaign. We will utilize community-based art and the theatrical pageant (a procession with site specific performances), an indigenous art-form to mobilize the community to identify the issues, raise public awareness, participate in direct action and implement solutions to mitigate the severe environmental crisis of pollution and contamination of a major natural water resource and to counter the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>An <b>educational workshop series</b> builds community engagement and awareness of the Vaigai River for 3 months from January through April, 2015 leading up to the culminating Vaigai River Restoration Pageant. Through the workshops, environmental educators inspire community participants to learn about the river issues and solutions. This work provides the inspiration and a “place-based” learning process that is foundation for the creative ideas for the pageant. Community participants work with local artisans/artists-in-residence to create giant mobile sculptures, puppets, costumes, visual artwork, and performances to highlight the Vaigai River, its history, habitat, water quality, related issues of sanitation and climate change, and future restoration. The workshops are offered free of cost to the community and culminate in the Vaigai River Restoration Pageant in May 2015.</p>
<p>The culminating <b>Vaigai River Restoration Pageant</b> includes a procession of giant mobile sculptures, spectacular costumes, and musical bands with site-specific performances of theater, music, storytelling, poetry, and dance by local folk performing groups, organizations, schools, and community participants that highlight the issues and solutions of the Vaigai River. </p>
<p><b><span style=""color: #8CC63F;"">Location / Procession Route:</span></b> The performances are presented at significant sites along the banks of the Vaigai River from Villangudi to Albert Victor Bridge and the Maiya Mandapam, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, South India.</p>

<p>Madurai, situated on the banks of the Vaigai River, in Tamil Nadu, Southern India, is known as the Temple City of India. Marco Polo called Madurai the most splendid province on Earth. The magnificence of Madurai as a cultural center since the Tamil Era 2,500 years ago, as well as the beauty of the Vaigai River that runs through it, has been celebrated for thousands of years in Indian literature and sacred texts. Here the ancient past exists alongside the modern world, with its people still practicing sacred and ancient traditions rooted in its legendary history. Meenakshi Temple is known for its magnificent Dravidian architecture with gopurams (gateways) completely covered with intricate colorful sculptural images of gods, animals, and mythical creatures. Madurai’s significance as a center for textiles dates back to its ancient past. Madurai is also the place where in 1921 Mahatma Gandhi relinquished his western clothing to wear a loincloth made of khadi (homespun cloth) as an act to align himself with the people, and as an act of social change.</p>

pollutants. Only by increasing the water flow of the river, it can be brought

Implement Solutions</b></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>One of the first steps to
restoring the Vaigai River is building a collaborative partnership of
stakeholders</b>, including environmental organizations, schools, universities,
farming groups, activists, government representatives, cultural
institutions, artisans, performers, and the people of Madurai, who
will be mobilized and work together to positively impact the future of the
Vaigai River. Through the innovative and creative strategy, we will
engage community participants in a grassroots educational and social
action campaign. The community will help identify the issues, raise public
awareness, and participate in direct action and implementation of
solutions. </p>
<p><b>Actions Already Underway since April 2014: </b></p>
<p>• <b>Stakeholders Meetings</b> in Madurai being organized by the DHAN Foundation</p>
<p>• <b>Building partnerships and collaborations</b> for the workshops and pageant
with numerous schools and organizations including TheThiagarajar
College of Engineering, Tata/DHAN Academy, Vivekenanda College, Fatima College, and womens' empowerment groups. The
group of partner organizations and community participants is growing every day,
along with our global support network from New York, California, Delhi, Mumbai,
Chennai, Madurai, and beyond.</p>
<p>• <b>Enlisting artisans</b> of folk art and performing
traditions from clay sculpture, paper mache, handloom weavers, Sungadi sari
makers, artisans utilizing traditional organic vegetable dye techniques,
painters, kavadi headdress builders, as well as performers of music, dance,
theater, poetry, storytelling, and ceremony. </p>

<p><b><span style=""color: #8CC63F;""><strong>Educational Community-Building Workshops: January — April 2015:</strong></span></b></p>
<p><b>Free workshops will be conducted by the artists-in-residence/workshop instructors in collaboration with environmental educators</b> to engage community members and students, educating the participants
on the issues of the Vaigai River and solutions to be implemented. <a href=""http://www.asiainitiatives.org/soccs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Asia
Initiatives</a> will bring in their unique system of Social Capital Credits
(SoCCs) as a way to incentivize the community to attend the workshops and
contribute towards the river restoration. The work created in the workshops will
raise awareness for specific issues and will be presented in the Pageant.</p>
<p><b>The workshop series engages
youth and adults for 3 months to:</b></p>
<p><span>•  </span><b>Explore
the diversity of plant and animal life</b> as indicators of the river’s
health, as well as discuss current issues concerning pollution and waste through
a ‘place-based’ learning process.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span><b>Work with artists-in-residence</b> to create spectacular
visual arts works such as mobile sculptures/puppets and costumes for the
procession inspired by the species, habitats, issues, and restoration efforts
of the river.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span><b>Utilize ecologically friendly practices</b> in the
creation of art projects, incorporating the use of recycled, natural and
organic materials.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span><b>Engage local artisans</b> to participate in the project creating visual art projects highlighting their folk art traditions such as: clay sculptures, costumes, handloom textiles, bamboo/paper-maché sculpture, decorative processional staffs, headdresses, masks, face painting,
palanquins/processional sculpture carts, kolam rice/chalk powder drawings,
Sungudi saree and dyeing techniques, that revive traditional vegetables dyes
rather than chemical dyes that pollute the river.</p>
<p>•<span>  </span><b>Social Capital Credits (SoCCs)</b>, a virtual currency for social good, will be used to implement the above processes not only during the workshops, but as a long term practice for sustainable ecological and social development. People will be able to earn SoCCs by helping with the pageant, and river cleaning actions such as waste management, maintaining irrigation channels and water tanks, planting trees etc. They will be able to use the SoCCs thus earned to get services like subsidized electricity, telephone talk time, school scholarships, healthcare, etc. </p>

The Vaigai River Restoration Project is a social action project to restore the Vaigai River in Madurai, India that is in a severe crisis due to pollution, waste dumping, and the drying effects of climate change.

While in Madurai for the Vaigai River Restoration Project I witnessed the devastating results of a sanitation crisis and the drying effects of climate change. The river is dry much of the year and has become a dumping ground for sewage, waste, and heaps of plastic bottles that have no where to go.

The Vaigai River Restoration Project is an international collaborative effort between US and Indian based organizations including Earth Celebrations, Asia Initiatives, and DHAN Foundation, along with local community, city,  state, and national officials, experts, academic institutions, and partner organizations to restore the Vaigai River in Madurai, India that is in a severe crisis due to pollution, waste dumping, and the drying effects of climate change. The project incorporates a minimum 5-10 year plan, with a year-long cycle of creative civic engagement of organizations, academic institutions, government agencies, schools, and community. The project utilizes innovative methodologies developed over the past 25 years by Felicia Young, Founder/Executive Director of Earth Celebrations, applying local arts and cultural traditions, to inspire and build coalition efforts to develop solutions, impact policy, and create societal change on crucial environmental issues. Through stakeholder meetings, coalition efforts, educational workshops, environmental and cultural events, and a public social action art project, the community is inspired and mobilized to work together on a plan to mitigate contamination of the Vaigai River water supply and develop adaptation solutions to climate change.The other innovation we are utilizing for the project is the concept of Social Capital Credit (SoCC), developed by Dr. Geeta Mehta, President of Asia Initiatives and Professor of Urban Studies and Architecture at Columbia University. SoCCs are a community currency of incentives people will earn by becoming custodians of the river, as well as for waste management and rain water harvesting which will help people improve their local environment and enable them to climb out of poverty. 
Goals: 
The goals of the project are achieved by building a city-wide grass-roots coalition effort that will: 



Mobilize public support to effect public policy change.  


Engage community stakeholders, government officials, cultural organizations, academic institutions, environmental scientists, academics, artists, and experts on the issues to work together as a coalition to develop and implement solutions.  


Educate local residents on the issues and alter behavior that is polluting the river and destroying and depleting their natural resources.


Catalyze implementation of solutions to mitigate and adapt to the drying effects of climate change through water storage tanks/ooranis, agricultural irrigation, democratization of controlled dam water releases, and educational water conservation projects.


Inspire action on these issues through an innovative and creative strategy utilizing the local arts and cultural heritage of Madurai to effect environmental, political, cultural, and social transformation.



Civic Engagement & Cultural Strategies: 
The project utilizes cultural strategies as a inspirational and creative method to mobilize grass-roots civic engagement of community people and build a diverse coalition of stakeholders working on this effort. The project engages residents of the urban and rural areas, youth, artists, performing groups, environmental scientists, academics, government officials, farmers, fishermen, and other groups that use the river, as well as government agencies, and environmental, cultural, religious, and academic institutions throughout the city. Through the process of creating a theatrical pageant highlighting the water, pollution, and climate crisis, stakeholders will mobilize an action campaign, and strengthen the coalition efforts to implement solutions for agriculture, safe drinking water, water storage, conservation, a sustainable urban renewal plan for Madurai.



Workshops & Social Action Art

The Vaigai River Restoration Project includes an Environmental & Art Workshop Series that builds community engagement and awareness of the Vaigai River and issues of climate change for 3 months (January - April). Environmental educators engage participants to explore issues of water contamination, pollution, and climate change mitigation and adaptation, that provide the inspirational content for the visual art work created in the workshops. Local artisans specializing in various art, craft, performance, and folk traditions, engage community participants in the process of creating mobile sculptures, costumes, visual art, and performances highlighting the issues. A minimum of 100 workshops will be conducted at the Thiagarajar College,Tata/DHAN Academy, as well as other schools and institutions. Workshops will be offered free of cost to the community and engage many local organizations. The workshops and creative community and coalition building process culminates in the Vaigai River Restoration Pageant, a public procession of giant mobile sculptures, spectacular costumes, and musical bands with performances at significant sites along the river highlighting the issues and solutions. 

The Vaigai River Restoration Project has come at a critical time to have an impact on the restoration of the Vaigai River is Madurai, Tamil Nadu, South India, and can also serve a global model for ecological and social change through the arts. Help Earth Celebrations get back to India for this important project that brings our creative environmental strategies, originally inspired by the pageantry and community engaged arts of India and Madurai, that we applied to our 15 year effort to preserve the community gardens of New York City and to the restoration of the Hudson River Estuary, now back to India and Madurai after 25 years to have an impact on a major local and global water crisis.

VAIGAI RIVER RESTORATION PROJECT DETAILED SUMMARY


What is the Vaigai River Restoration Project?

The Vaigai River Restoration Project is an environmental social action project to mobilize community engagement and implement solutions to restore the Vaigai River and mitigate the severe crisis of water contamination, pollution, waste dumping, and adapt to the drying effects of climate change, affecting the drinking water, agriculture, and the survival of the people of Madurai, South India.

CREATIVE STRATEGIES: Community Building, Public Awareness, Education, Social Action, and Implementation of Solutions

Through the innovative and creative strategy and model of the Vaigai River Restoration Project, we will engage community participants in a grassroots educational and social action campaign. We will utilize community-based art and the theatrical pageant (a procession with site specific performances), an indigenous art-form to mobilize the community to identify the issues, raise public awareness, participate in direct action and implement solutions to mitigate the severe environmental crisis of pollution and contamination of a major natural water resource and to counter the effects of climate change.
An educational workshop series builds community engagement and awareness of the Vaigai River for 3 months from January through April, 2015 leading up to the culminating Vaigai River Restoration Pageant. Through the workshops, environmental educators inspire community participants to learn about the river issues and solutions. This work provides the inspiration and a “place-based” learning process that is foundation for the creative ideas for the pageant. Community participants work with local artisans/artists-in-residence to create giant mobile sculptures, puppets, costumes, visual artwork, and performances to highlight the Vaigai River, its history, habitat, water quality, related issues of sanitation and climate change, and future restoration. The workshops are offered free of cost to the community and culminate in the Vaigai River Restoration Pageant in May 2015.
The culminating Vaigai River Restoration Pageant includes a procession of giant mobile sculptures, spectacular costumes, and musical bands with site-specific performances of theater, music, storytelling, poetry, and dance by local folk performing groups, organizations, schools, and community participants that highlight the issues and solutions of the Vaigai River. 
Location / Procession Route: The performances are presented at significant sites along the banks of the Vaigai River from Villangudi to Albert Victor Bridge and the Maiya Mandapam, in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, South India.

MADURAI 
Madurai, situated on the banks of the Vaigai River, in Tamil Nadu, Southern India, is known as the Temple City of India. Marco Polo called Madurai the most splendid province on Earth. The magnificence of Madurai as a cultural center since the Tamil Era 2,500 years ago, as well as the beauty of the Vaigai River that runs through it, has been celebrated for thousands of years in Indian literature and sacred texts. Here the ancient past exists alongside the modern world, with its people still practicing sacred and ancient traditions rooted in its legendary history. Meenakshi Temple is known for its magnificent Dravidian architecture with gopurams (gateways) completely covered with intricate colorful sculptural images of gods, animals, and mythical creatures. Madurai’s significance as a center for textiles dates back to its ancient past. Madurai is also the place where in 1921 Mahatma Gandhi relinquished his western clothing to wear a loincloth made of khadi (homespun cloth) as an act to align himself with the people, and as an act of social change.

GOALS: Community Building, Social Action, & Solutions
The project plans for the Vaigai River Restoration include the following:
• Raising awareness for better waste management practices among communities.
• Raising awareness for restoration of water quality, efforts to provide safe drinking water, and  DHAN Foundation’s existing projects such as Vayalagam Tankfed Agriculture Development Program (VTADP).
• Building partnerships of stakeholders and engaging city officials, corporations, environmental organizations, activists, farming groups, schools and universities to be mobilized and participate in solutions to restore the river
• Engaging community participation in creative ecological art project and pageant performance to bring attention to the river, its history, and efforts to restore the health of the river for drinking water, agriculture, recreation, and peaceful open space within the city 
• Highlight and initiate proposals for visions for the future of the river such as a river park along the banks of the Vaigai and other recreational uses that promote the care and appreciation of the river, its historical legacy, and future as an ecological oasis within the city

STATEMENTS
OF NEED 
“Once the preliminary work of clearing garbage is completed, measures will be taken to stop public from letting sewage water into the river. We have invited suggestions from people and activists to keep the river clean.”   - Mayor V.V. Rajan Chellappa of Madurai

“The
major area of pollution falls within the city limit… solid waste, plastic
waste, untreated sewage water from institutions and houses act as the major
pollutants. Only by increasing the water flow of the river, it can be brought
to life again. Mixing of sewage water and dumping of solid waste should also be
stopped to set it right.”   - Professor G
Balaji, Department of Architecture, Thiagarajar College of Engineering
“A
proper vision from all stakeholders will help preserve our rivers.”   - K Kalidas,
President of Osai, an environmental NGO
“Untreated
effluents have raised the pollution level of water. The concentration of total
dissolved solids (TSD) in water here is 3,500 to 4,000 ppm, when the acceptable
level should be below 500 ppm. Resultantly, the areas adjoining Chinnalapatti
are fast becoming barren due to underground pollution. Agriculture is also affected.” - S
Mahendran, Manager of the Agriculture Technology Management Association

STRATEGY: Raise Awareness, Mobilize Action &
Implement Solutions

One of the first steps to
restoring the Vaigai River is building a collaborative partnership of
stakeholders, including environmental organizations, schools, universities,
farming groups, activists, government representatives, cultural
institutions, artisans, performers, and the people of Madurai, who
will be mobilized and work together to positively impact the future of the
Vaigai River. Through the innovative and creative strategy, we will
engage community participants in a grassroots educational and social
action campaign. The community will help identify the issues, raise public
awareness, and participate in direct action and implementation of
solutions. 
Actions Already Underway since April 2014: 
• Stakeholders Meetings in Madurai being organized by the DHAN Foundation
• Building partnerships and collaborations for the workshops and pageant
with numerous schools and organizations including TheThiagarajar
College of Engineering, Tata/DHAN Academy, Vivekenanda College, Fatima College, and womens' empowerment groups. The
group of partner organizations and community participants is growing every day,
along with our global support network from New York, California, Delhi, Mumbai,
Chennai, Madurai, and beyond.
• Enlisting artisans of folk art and performing
traditions from clay sculpture, paper mache, handloom weavers, Sungadi sari
makers, artisans utilizing traditional organic vegetable dye techniques,
painters, kavadi headdress builders, as well as performers of music, dance,
theater, poetry, storytelling, and ceremony. 
• Gathering key environmental educators to work
alongside the artisans for the educational workshops.

Earth Celebrations Workshops in 2012 engaging children in NYC to create Stewards of the River Robes using homemade paint made from fruits, vegetables, and plants.
Educational Community-Building Workshops: January — April 2015:
Free workshops will be conducted by the artists-in-residence/workshop instructors in collaboration with environmental educators to engage community members and students, educating the participants
on the issues of the Vaigai River and solutions to be implemented. Asia
Initiatives will bring in their unique system of Social Capital Credits
(SoCCs) as a way to incentivize the community to attend the workshops and
contribute towards the river restoration. The work created in the workshops will
raise awareness for specific issues and will be presented in the Pageant.
The workshop series engages
youth and adults for 3 months to:
•  Explore
the diversity of plant and animal life as indicators of the river’s
health, as well as discuss current issues concerning pollution and waste through
a ‘place-based’ learning process.
•  Work with artists-in-residence to create spectacular
visual arts works such as mobile sculptures/puppets and costumes for the
procession inspired by the species, habitats, issues, and restoration efforts
of the river.
•  Utilize ecologically friendly practices in the
creation of art projects, incorporating the use of recycled, natural and
organic materials.
•  Engage local artisans to participate in the project creating visual art projects highlighting their folk art traditions such as: clay sculptures, costumes, handloom textiles, bamboo/paper-maché sculpture, decorative processional staffs, headdresses, masks, face painting,
palanquins/processional sculpture carts, kolam rice/chalk powder drawings,
Sungudi saree and dyeing techniques, that revive traditional vegetables dyes
rather than chemical dyes that pollute the river.
•  Social Capital Credits (SoCCs), a virtual currency for social good, will be used to implement the above processes not only during the workshops, but as a long term practice for sustainable ecological and social development. People will be able to earn SoCCs by helping with the pageant, and river cleaning actions such as waste management, maintaining irrigation channels and water tanks, planting trees etc. They will be able to use the SoCCs thus earned to get services like subsidized electricity, telephone talk time, school scholarships, healthcare, etc.

Next to a site of Special Scientific Interest there is a wonderful nature reserve. Soon the<br/>birds will be frightened away by 24 hour a day drilling. We expect IGas to put in a formal application to Notts County Council in May. This will be to drill an<br/>exploratory well and do some deep experimental fracking into the Bowland Shale. The intention is to crack open the rocks with hundreds of gallons of water and<br/>poisons. They want to draw up methane which will damage the environment. A short space away is an aquifer which is made of special sandstone and supplies pure drinking water across the north of the county. The fracking company have spent thousands of pounds already on glossy exhibitions to try and convince the<br/>villagers that everything will be fine. Those who know anything about the real dangers of fracking know that it will not.<br/><br/>That is why we are appealing to you. We have a small band of volunteers playing David against Goliath. We have only little money left for leaflets. We do not<br/>have a real income from anywhere.<br/><br/>But now we have a chance to defeat the fracking company. There is a retired professor of geology, who is now living in a French village and is passionately<br/>against fracking. He has told the Chairman of the Bassetlaw Against Fracking group that he is very concerned about damage and leakage into the water supply. If<br/>he can prove this, his evidence will be significant in persuading the Notts County Council Planning Committee not to agree to the application.<br/><br/>He is Emeritus Professor David Smythe.

Next to a site of Special Scientific Interest there is a wonderful nature reserve. Soon thebirds will be frightened away by 24 hour a day drilling. We expect IGas to put in a formal application to Notts County Council in May. This will be to drill anexploratory well and do some deep experimental fracking into the Bowland Shale. The intention is to crack open the rocks with hundreds of gallons of water andpoisons. They want to draw up methane which will damage the environment. A short space away is an aquifer which is made of special sandstone and supplies pure drinking water across the north of the county. The fracking company have spent thousands of pounds already on glossy exhibitions to try and convince thevillagers that everything will be fine. Those who know anything about the real dangers of fracking know that it will not.That is why we are appealing to you. We have a small band of volunteers playing David against Goliath. We have only little money left for leaflets. We do nothave a real income from anywhere.But now we have a chance to defeat the fracking company. There is a retired professor of geology, who is now living in a French village and is passionatelyagainst fracking. He has told the Chairman of the Bassetlaw Against Fracking group that he is very concerned about damage and leakage into the water supply. Ifhe can prove this, his evidence will be significant in persuading the Notts County Council Planning Committee not to agree to the application.He is Emeritus Professor David Smythe. His lifetime work in studying geology was at Glasgow University. Already he has helped anti-fracking groups in Scotland,Lancashire and the village of Balcombe in the south of England with his research he has agreed to help us.

<h3>The Big Picture</h3>
<p>Sue Biely was worried about the planet and wasn't sure what she could do about it. Living in Vancouver and working in the culture sector, she has the heart of an activist and the skills of a storyteller, educator, and group facilitator. One day, in her apartment high off the ground in a city that gets more densely populated and urbanized every year, she found herself wondering ""what would this city look like in ten years if our homes and offices had no indoor plants?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487705133/crprgfwodqpudfrd2iuo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When we live in spaces that are all right-angles and man-made materials, what does that do to our brains? What is happening to our ancient knowledge of how to take care of plants, how to make plant babies, and what different plants are good for? What if our connection to nature also impacts our connection to each other?</p>
<p><strong>Inside Green</strong> seeks to play with these questions and more. What if we were to gift every urbanite an indoor plant? What if we each had a little piece of nature brought into our homes or workspaces...that we were personally responsible for? What if those of us who live in boxes in the sky, who don’t have access to soil, could actually feel what it is like to connect with a piece of living nature, and to steward it?</p>
<p>Sue decided to experiment. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487705019/onegcgemki3pydocutgj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The result is <strong>Inside Green</strong>, a project that gifts plants to urbanites and teaches them how to care for those plants and propagate them, in turn gifting those baby plants to the community around them.</p>
<p>This project removes waste from the waste cycle by re-using cans, increases individuals’ access to nature, and greens the inside of buildings. It produces cleaner air for the city, and provides numerous health benefits for those who share space with indoor plants. Plant gifting connects Vancouverites with each other, and provides a gentle introduction to stewardship. <strong>Inside Green</strong>'s website tracks the data and collects stories about how Vancouverites are growing a greener city.</p>
<p>We have already been hard at work on a pilot project, and are ready to take this *BIGGER*. Our goal is to gift more plants in the Vancouver area, build more social interaction features on the website, and lead more educational workshops in schools and businesses about indoor plants. We wish to deepen the elements and experience of community (and FUN!), while showing evidence of how this is a thriving, successful method of greening our cities from the inside out.</p>

<h3>Our History, and our Future</h3>
<p><strong>Inside Green</strong> was piloted in the summer of 2016 thanks to a grant from Creative BC’s Interactive Fund and the involvement and support of many friends and community activists. There are over 650 plants registered on the <strong>Inside Green</strong> website, with 25% of those being plant babies from the original gifted plants. We have shown up at farmer's markets and thrown ""plant parties"" where we have given out plants to everyone that was interested and willing to register as a Plant Steward on our website. We have created a Plantcestry on our site to track where plant babies go and who they have come from, so as to better see the spreading GREENeology of plants and community across our city. We have created videos that show step by step ‘how to make plant babies’ with all the different species of plants we have been gifting. We have collected video footage of school groups learning about indoor plants, and students receiving their own plants to take home, nurture, and love. We have received incredible stories of plants that have accompanied humans through various life experiences - sometimes spanning generations and thousands of miles. We have tapped into a vein, and want to take this adventure FURTHER.</p>

<p>The potential of this plant-gifting project to go viral is huge, and the beneficiaries will be ALL OF US. The more we are able to demonstrate with data and stories the positive impact of greening our cities from the inside out,  the more momentum we can create.  One plant, one person at a time we hope to model and inspire collective stewardship that will shift our relationship to the planet. And so we hope to not only green Vancouver, but to green any city that is growing vertically around the world!</p>
<p><strong>Inside Green</strong> has been created with a structure that is ready for expansion: we are ready to grow as funds allow. More green! Healthier people! Cleaner air! Preservation of our knowledge of propagation and how to successfully steward nature's growth! Let's shift our concept of nature from being ""out there"" and “someone else's responsibility,” to being in our living spaces and directly connected to mutual health and well-being!</p>

<p><strong>Boost your emotional, physical and mental health with plants!</strong><br/>Indoor plants have been shown to have a significant impact on the general well-being of people. Research has demonstrated their ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boost mood, increasing happiness</li>
<li>Improve relationships and access to feeling compassion </li>
<li>Reduce stress</li>
<li>Lower blood pressure</li>
<li>Improve concentration and memory retention</li>

<li>Increase productivity</li>
<li>Relieve aches and pains</li>
<li>Accelerate the healing process</li>
<li>Decrease the number of sick days taken from work</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plants want to help clean your space from toxins and irritants!</strong><br/>Indoor plants interact with the air they are in better than filters or fans. Here’s what plants do for the environment inside:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purify and revitalize stale air</li>
<li>Reduce airborne contaminants such as mold spores, dust, and bacteria, (plants have been found to reduce the airborne content by as much as 50-60%!)</li>
<li>Regulate the humidity of a room, keeping it at the optimum level for human comfort, health and productivity</li>
<li>Increase ozone, and reduce pollutants (smog) and chemicals such as formaldehyde, benzene, trichloroethylene, acetone and nitrogen</li>

<h3>The Theory Behind the Design</h3>
<ul></ul>
<p>How do we successfully foster change and create true measurable positive impact on the environment? This question was the guiding force behind the design of <strong>Inside Green</strong><strong>. </strong></p>
<p>If our goal is to have more people engage in new plant-stewardship behaviours - successfully, and long-term - then we need to make it easy for them. This means reducing risk and failure, making it easy to sign up and receive a plant, and creating intrinsic rewards that make people feel awesome as they try on a new habit. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487705958/fdmqa4xt9vaechg2pzkb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To this end, we have made the process the playful, matching people with plants through a fun interactive tool, celebrating key points in the plants progress with Stewards, and setting the expectation that this is a no-shame project: if your plant dies, it’s simply to be marked as compost.</p>
<p>We create accountability through gentle means: by gifting plants through real-life relationships, we naturally access motivation and encouragement. Renewed interactions with family, friends, and neighbours around baby plants creates new community bonds, a happy side-effect that we are delighted to support. Watching how your plant connects you to the community at large as plants have babies and are gifted forward is an empowering visual reminder of the impact we have on our community and environment through the simple act of stewardship of indoor plants.</p>
<p>Most environmental projects seek to change our behaviour by encouraging us to do something less and give things up. <strong>Inside Green</strong> inverts that by providing a positive tangible experience with a real slice of nature - a pleasant addition to participants’ lives rather than one more thing they need to stop or remove for the sake of environmental sustainability.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487706047/wvygz4zottzaosztawq5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We also went one step farther by pulling materials from the waste cycle as much as possible. Our plants are placed in aluminum can ""pots"" - every can was originally destined for either recycling or the landfill, and we have reclaimed them and repurposed them as housing for our indoor plant babies.</p>
<h3>What Could go Wrong?</h3>
<p>We've worked out most of the kinks already with our prototype and pilot program that launched in 2016. So here's what could possibly throw a wrench in our plans: all the plants die (which would mean we make a heap of really good compost); we can't get enough 28 fl oz cans out of the waste cycle and need to find something else to use as pots; or sign-ups to become stewards are slowed by hindrances such as: the majority of our urbanites have already lost the ability to care for plants and are unwilling to re-learn, people think that looking after nature is something that someone else does, a lack of interest in having plants inside their home.</p>
<p>We have already witnessed a response to the project that indicates we will not encounter these problems (at least, not enough to cause significant hampering of our goals).

<h3>Plastic Energy Solutions</h3>
<p>Owner: <i>Karl Klaiss</i></p>
<p>PES is a company that was founded for one reason:</p>
<p> <i><b>To help clean up the planet one step at a time. <br/></b></i></p>
<p>However we found that cleaning up the mess was only half the problem. After a short while the mess would reappear due to human consumption. So rather than try to clean up the mess on the ground, we decided to start the cleanup process at or before the dumpster. </p>
<p>After being in manufacturing for nearly 20 years with almost half of that dedicated to plastics, I found that much of the plastic we use and throw away today could be a potential source of energy in one form or another if converted properly. The problem was that the recycling methods used in many places today combined the plastics into a single pile from which many recyclers would have to employ specific sorting methods to separate what they deemed of value versus the rest of the waste. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</p>
<p><i><b>The tech behind the process</b></i>:</p>
<p>Using current technology PES employs Pyrolysis, a recycling method that will convert plastic back into usable oil. Though there are several types of pyrolysis operations in the U.S., the basic problem with many of these units is that they are geared specifically for only one type of plastic. In the PES process, we are able to employ a combination of technologies to convert four of the seven plastic varieties into oil. <br/></p>
<p>The plastics able to be converted by the PES process:</p>
<p>#2 - HDPE</p>
<p>#4 - LDPE</p>
<p>#5 - PP</p>
<p>#6 - PS<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</p>
<p><i><b>The Goal:</b></i><br/></p>
<p>With the desktop model up and running, we will be looking to build a processing center that will be able to convert approximately 1,300 lbs. of material per day into oil. However, our stretch goal would be to employ not just one but several machines to recycle more of the waste produced every day. For every ton of plastic that we recycle we save:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>30 cubic yards of landfill space.</li>
<li>5,774 kWh of electricity.</li>
<li>685 gallons of oil.</li>
<li>98 million BTU's of energy. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Considering that just one of our machines recycles 1,300 lbs. per day that will equate to almost 170 tons of material that will never reach the landfill each year. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Employment Goal:</i></b></p>
<p>In most recycling businesses the inevitable job of sorting is
handled by automation where possible and able workers where it is not. At PES
our focus is not on automation but rather the people and we plan to hire underprivileged
and disabled individuals. To us this is the best way we can serve the community
and the people within it. </p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Plastic recycling is not just about the ability to help clean up the environment, but it also helps to take us to that next level in building a sustainable society. What we do today has repercussions for the future so if we each provide a small effort now, the repercussion will be evident tomorrow. In the gallery you will find a small file with a snippet of the impact that waste has just from a collection view. </p>
<p></p>
<p><i><b>How is Pyrolysis deployed by PES able to be used on different plastics vs other companies using the same tech?</b></i></p>
<p>PES uses a technology that enables the complete mixture of #2, 4, 5, &amp; 6 prior to the melt stage. During the pyrolysis process the plastic is then heated to eventually turn the solid into a gas form. This gas is then liquefied through a condensation of the gas and the off gases are separated and channeled to a catalytic converter (similar to that of a car) and release as water vapor and CO2. The main difference from other companies is that they use the off gasses to run their combustion generators thus in the end they are still adding to the pollutants such as CO and other combustion pollutants into the atmosphere. </p>
<p><i><b>The oil produced, by these different plastics, will it be used differently?</b></i></p>
<p>Typically most companies that utilize pyrolysis attack the higher commodity cost goods in the waste stream such as tires and other very specific plastics such as strictly #6 plastic. These goods produce an oil that is in demand by specific industries so they set up their production based on that single stream function. </p>
<p>At PES we look at the stream from a vantage point that it is all waste and it all needs to be cleaned up, not just the single type. The heating oil produced is a higher grade then typically sold on the open market because of its sulfur free content but because it is cheaper to produce than processing through crude we will be able to offer the finished product to dealers and distributors cheaper than the oil companies. </p>
<p>Additionally, since the finished oil product is free of sulfur it burns cleaner then its counterparts sold by the oil companies. This is partly due to the regulations for home heating oil are lesser than other crude oil byproducts. When looking at home heating furnaces the efficiency ratings are considerably higher than the diesel engine (which by the way #2 oil and diesel are the same thing). </p>
<p>The reason that PES will not be pushing into the diesel market is due to regulations surrounding the sulfur requirements and the fact that we do not look to add to that side of the pollution equation. However, I did get one argument from a group of people that I spoke with about the fact that we are still producing oil to burn. The fact of that is true but when you compare the diesel engine efficiency of 40 - 50% to that of a home heating unit between 80 - 95% we all begin to see the difference. </p>

Three days and some 80 aftershocks later, with rising death toll of more than five thousand,  people in rural Nepal are now feeling the brunt of the catastrophe. At least 8 million- one third of the entire Nepali population have been affected.<br/></p>
<p>As the international relief efforts and funds come together, smaller modular projects with specific goal become more important. With this in mind, Team Nidan and ADWAN, who in past have a history of extensive social and economical work in the area, are putting together an immediate food and shelter relief fund for three villages of Gorkha District - Bakrang, Taklung and Tanglichok. These villages, although only about eighty kilometers outside of Kathmandu, are nestled within treacherous hills and mountains and are some of the most inaccessible areas of the country.   </p>
<p>Nidan has worked and funded projects in Nepal since 2012 and are continuously working with local NGO - ADWAN Gorkha district. Our combined team of doctors, nurses and social workers was there last month (March 2015) for Reproductive and Child Health Education. You can see their work at - <br/></p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2> <p>I want to start this off by saying. Even If I am unable to raise another dime here. I want to thank you for reading, And say that if you weren't aware of the tiny house movement, you should be, Its neat. And while it is NOT for everybody, It might just be for you :)<br/></p>
<p>Now, a bit about me. *This was written at different times, as I'm a bit of an oddball with afterthoughts. *<br/></p>
<p>I work and work, Its really all I know how to do. I work just to go home, just to go to work. Which you know I'm fine with. What I'm not fine with however is doing all of this just to pay someone else s mortgage. Rent is a black hole, and I'm tired of being stretched out to my singularity trying to pay it. I watched a documentary that introduced and idea that I am stunned I haven't thought of, and that is one of building a tiny house..</p>
<p>I'd love to tell a whole story about myself, and make it easier to connect with me. But the last thing I want is for this to be some kind of sob story.  Which most of my life has been, But that is not the point I want to get across, or why I'm hoping you would help. I just want to be free of the rising living cost in a city I am unable to move away from.  In the current state of affairs I am in, I wont be able to save enough for 14 years ( rough calculations based on current bills, no raise, and a assumed income ) . . Now you can see why I turned here. It didn't used to be this bad , before my room mate moved out with 0 notice a few months back. Did I mention he was the lease holder , and I'm paying rent as a squatter essentially? I am however repainting the house and trying to leave it nicer than when we moved in. I do my best with what I got. I want something of my own though. I cant bring myself to sign another lease, with another room mate. Not again. <br/></p>
<p>I quit drinking last year, and smoking in Feb. of this year. Mainly to save money, but also for my health. I use E-cigs, which I build myself, simply because it is the cheapest option. I fix my 1994 Mazda truck myself ( Paid $500 for it 3 years back ). I feel like I must add these details for my frugality has been called into question.  To that I welcome anyone to visit me for a week. Bring Your Own Food. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My plan is to get a trailer and build the shell as fast as possible, then live in it while I finish it. I cannot afford however to buy the trailer and pay my rent at the same time. I struggle just to get my rent paid each month.. I want to be clear, I dont want people to pay for me to build my own house. More just help me get the first peice, The trailer. From there I can afford the whole project. There is just outright no way I can lump $5k for a trailer.. So if helping a stranger free himself sounds like something your interested in. Feel free, and thank you from the bottom of my heart if you have even taken the time to read this. Tiny houses might be for you as well :)<br/></p>
</div>TL:DR: Cant afford a trailer to start construction of my a tiny house. Giving this a go <br/>:) If anyone has any suggestions, or questions. I'm new to this so feel free to ask .<br/></div>","the not so

<p>Did you know that a significant percentage of them never make it to their destination due to exhaustion and starvation?</p>
<p>Did you know that, every spring, the birds that survive to land in the most beautiful stop over sites in Greece, the Ionian islands, get shot and never reach Northern Europe in order to reproduce?</p>
<p>Did you know that hunting during spring has been banned since 1985, but it is still not properly enforced in Greece?</p>
<p>Well… If you help us raise sufficient funds for our “A Safe Ηaven for Wild Birds” campaign you and thousands of others will find out and put this illegal and catastrophic activity where is belongs: in the past!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Why Wild Birds need Your Help</strong></p>
<p>Illegal killing during spring migration has taken place for decades in the Ionian Islands (more intensely in Zakynthos, Strofadia, Corfu, Paxoi and Othonoi), as these are situated along a major bird migratory route. This illegal activity is deeply engrained in the local culture. It also represents an economic benefit for the local community, as land in the best “spots” is rented out expensively during about three weeks between end of March and the early April. The illegal activity in the Ionian Islands is particularly severe: HOS surveys indicate that gunshot numbers may reach up to 15,000 per day during a day with “good” south winds.</p>
<p>The main species targeted is the Turtle Dove (Streptopelia turtur), whose conservation status is classified as ‘Unfavourable’ in the EU. According to BirdLife International (2004, Birds in the European Union), its populations have declined by 10% since 1980. Moreover, the negative trend was caused by the ongoing habitat destruction and unsustainable levels of exploitation, part of which is illegal killing. During the illegal spring killing, several other species of migratory raptors and herons are shot as well such as Hen harrier (<em>Circus cyaneus</em>), Marsh harriere (<em>C. aeruginosus</em>), Red-footed Falcon (<em>Falco vespertinus</em>), Kestrel (<em>F. tinnunculus</em>), and herons.</p>
<p>Killing of migratory birds takes place during the return of the birds from Africa to the breeding grounds in Europe. The Ionian Islands are the first stopover for rest on route towards Northern Europe. They provide refuge and food for the arriving birds which are particularly vulnerable. Recent research by the Technological Educational Institute of the Ionian Islands and HOS has shown that the Turtle Doves that land in the Ionian Islands have below average body masses compared to those occurring in other parts of the Mediterranean in the same period, due to the longer distance they have to cover for reaching the east Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The main problem this campaign is tackling is the almost total lack of awareness among the general public, the authorities and the younger generation regarding the EU’s spring hunting ban, which was imposed in the 1980’s. Even though three decades have passed, Greece is not implementing the ban properly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A Safe haven for Wild Birds objectives</strong></p>
<p>The aim of the campaign is to reduce illegal killing of migratory wild birds in Greece during spring and this is happening in coordination with another two Mediterranean countries where illegal killing is still fairly common: Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>Our specific objectives of the campaign are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To change the socio-cultural attitudes towards illegal killing in the younger generation.</li>
<li>To raise the awareness of local communities, local authorities, hunters and the wider public along the migratory flyways of the species affected by the illegal activities.</li>
<li>To improve law enforcement, through increased awareness and better coordination among law enforcement authorities.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Who are we? </strong></p>
<p>Hellenic Ornithological Society (HOS) is an environmental non-governmental organization for the protection of wild birds and their habitats in Greece.</p>
<p>We were founded in 1982 by passionate bird lovers and scientists and our mission is to ensure a sustainable natural environment for birds and people.</p>
<p>As evidence to the continuous efforts and contributions of HOS to the protection of Greece’s natural environment, it was awarded the Environmental Protection Award by the National Academy in 1993.</p>
<p>Since 1994, the Hellenic Ornithological Society has been a partner of Birdlife International, the world’s largest organization concerned with the protection of birds and their habitats.</p>
<p>A significant result of our partnership was the inclusion of the Important Bird Areas in the European ‘ Natura 2000’ Network of protected areas.</p>
<p>HOS’ main focus is on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research on birds and their habitats, in order to implement actions of protection and conservation</li>
<li>Raising of public awareness regarding the natural environment, through operation of information centers throughout Greece, public awareness events, environmental education in schools and campaigning for crucial environmental issues and the effective implementation of environmental law</li>
<li>Site intervention advocacy and policy making for crucial environmental issues</li>
<li>Protection of birds and management of their habitats (monitoring of protected areas, population census, enhancement of the natural environment, habitats management and restoration)</li>
</ul><p><em>Our capacity</em></p>
<p>During the last decade HOS has implemented successfully 8 LIFE Nature projects aimed at the protection of priority bird species and their habitats. We are also responsible for monitoring and updating the Important Bird Areas network in Greece and have achieved the designation of the majority of these IBAs as SPAs of the Natura 2000 Network. Recently, it has scanned Greece’s seas in order to designate the marine IBA network!</p>
<p>There is therefore a strong, committed and experienced team at HOS that has taken on the task of implementing the campaign.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What we have done so far against illegal killing</strong></p>
<p>HOS has campaigned against illegal killing of wild birds throughout its work since 1983. More specifically, HOS has applied pressure to the national and local authorities in order to improve the transposition of the EU’s Birds Directive (that is, the oldest European legislation tool for the protection of biodiversity!) and to actually implement it on the ground.</p>
<p>Illegal killing in the Ionian Islands has been a key media action of HOS every year for the last four years, as we are seeing the Turtle Dove population rapidly reducing. However, more recently HOS has undertaken a series of data collection, lobbying, capacity building and media actions in order to create a clearer and realistic picture of what is happening on the ground, as well as find what are the exact reasons for not tackling the problem are.</p>
<p>This work has lead us to decide to launch the “Safe Ηaven for Wild Birds” three-year  campaign in August 2012, in order to address the problem in a more coordinated, effective and targeted manner.</p>
<p>The campaign’s overall budget in Greece is 120.000 €. The EU will partially finance the project with the amount of 60.000 €. The remaining amount (60.000€) is self-financed. This is of course a very difficult task due to the economic crisis in Greece and the dropping out of potential greek funders. So, your contribution is absolutely helpful for the continuation and the completion of this campaign!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we will do with YOUR help!</strong></p>
<p>1)      A “Safe Haven for Wild Birds” <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">national campaign</span>. HOS will deliver a three-year campaign that targets hunters associations, visitors, decision makers and the younger generation. The campaign will go through stages of growing level of involvement of the target audiences using a number of different channels and tools: press adverts, TV spot, radio spot, engagement in social networks, and printed materials such as posters and pins.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED COST: 21.000 €</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2)      <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Local campaign in the Ionian islands</span>: a series of local events and information kiosks in Zakynthos and Corfu throughout the summer months of the three years of the campaign aim to engage local communities and our volunteers. We will also organize a “training the media” session in Zante in order to increase sensitivity around spring killing in the local media.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED COST: 29,000 €</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3)      <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Production of a short documentary</span> in Greece regarding the spring killing of wild birds in the Ionian islands. The documentary will analyze the roots of this illegal activity and give voice to those negatively affected by it. The video will be presented at numerous environmental film festivals and will be available on the project website.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED COST: 13,000 €</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4)      <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Environmental education campaign</span> at local level in Greece. The younger generations will be informed though an environmental education package for 250 schools in the Ionian Islands and the local Environmental Education Centers.</p>
<p>ESTIMATED COST: 17,000 €</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5)      <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">International workshop on Bird Crime</span> in Greece. The workshop will raise the awareness of the law enforcement agencies and the decision makers about the extent of illegal killing of birds in the Mediterranean and will facilitate the exchange of best practices in persecuting the illegal bird killers across the Mediterranean.</p>

<h3><em><strong>With the contribution of the LIFE financial instrument of the European Union</strong></em></h3></div>","Did you know that every spring wild birds make a courageous thousands of kilometers journey in order to migrate with almost no stops to sleep, rest, feed or drink?
Did you know that a significant percentage of them never make it to their destination due to exhaustion and starvation?
Did you know that, every spring, the birds that survive to land in the most beautiful stop over sites in Greece, the Ionian islands, get shot and never reach Northern Europe in order to reproduce?
Did you know that hunting during spring has been banned since 1985, but it is still not properly enforced in Greece?
Well… If you help us raise sufficient funds for our “A Safe Ηaven for Wild Birds” campaign you and thousands of others will find out and put this illegal and catastrophic activity where is belongs: in the past!
 
Why Wild Birds need Your Help
Illegal killing during spring migration has taken place for decades in the Ionian Islands (more intensely in Zakynthos, Strofadia, Corfu, Paxoi and Othonoi), as these are situated along a major bird migratory route. This illegal activity is deeply engrained in the local culture. It also represents an economic benefit for the local community, as land in the best “spots” is rented out expensively during about three weeks between end of March and the early April. The illegal activity in the Ionian Islands is particularly severe: HOS surveys indicate that gunshot numbers may reach up to 15,000 per day during a day with “good” south winds.
The main species targeted is the Turtle Dove (Streptopelia turtur), whose conservation status is classified as ‘Unfavourable’ in the EU. According to BirdLife International (2004, Birds in the European Union), its populations have declined by 10% since 1980. Moreover, the negative trend was caused by the ongoing habitat destruction and unsustainable levels of exploitation, part of which is illegal killing. During the illegal spring killing, several other species of migratory raptors and herons are shot as well such as Hen harrier (Circus cyaneus), Marsh harriere (C. aeruginosus), Red-footed Falcon (Falco vespertinus), Kestrel (F. tinnunculus), and herons.
Killing of migratory birds takes place during the return of the birds from Africa to the breeding grounds in Europe. The Ionian Islands are the first stopover for rest on route towards Northern Europe. They provide refuge and food for the arriving birds which are particularly vulnerable. Recent research by the Technological Educational Institute of the Ionian Islands and HOS has shown that the Turtle Doves that land in the Ionian Islands have below average body masses compared to those occurring in other parts of the Mediterranean in the same period, due to the longer distance they have to cover for reaching the east Mediterranean.
The main problem this campaign is tackling is the almost total lack of awareness among the general public, the authorities and the younger generation regarding the EU’s spring hunting ban, which was imposed in the 1980’s. Even though three decades have passed, Greece is not implementing the ban properly.
 
A Safe haven for Wild Birds objectives
The aim of the campaign is to reduce illegal killing of migratory wild birds in Greece during spring and this is happening in coordination with another two Mediterranean countries where illegal killing is still fairly common: Italy and Spain.
Our specific objectives of the campaign are:

To change the socio-cultural attitudes towards illegal killing in the younger generation.
To raise the awareness of local communities, local authorities, hunters and the wider public along the migratory flyways of the species affected by the illegal activities.
To improve law enforcement, through increased awareness and better coordination among law enforcement authorities.
 
Who are we? 
Hellenic Ornithological Society (HOS) is an environmental non-governmental organization for the protection of wild birds and their habitats in Greece.
We were founded in 1982 by passionate bird lovers and scientists and our mission is to ensure a sustainable natural environment for birds and people.
As evidence to the continuous efforts and contributions of HOS to the protection of Greece’s natural environment, it was awarded the Environmental Protection Award by the National Academy in 1993.
Since 1994, the Hellenic Ornithological Society has been a partner of Birdlife International, the world’s largest organization concerned with the protection of birds and their habitats.
A significant result of our partnership was the inclusion of the Important Bird Areas in the European ‘ Natura 2000’ Network of protected areas.
HOS’ main focus is on:

Research on birds and their habitats, in order to implement actions of protection and conservation
Raising of public awareness regarding the natural environment, through operation of information centers throughout Greece, public awareness events, environmental education in schools and campaigning for crucial environmental issues and the effective implementation of environmental law
Site intervention advocacy and policy making for crucial environmental issues
Protection of birds and management of their habitats (monitoring of protected areas, population census, enhancement of the natural environment, habitats management and restoration)
Our capacity
During the last decade HOS has implemented successfully 8 LIFE Nature projects aimed at the protection of priority bird species and their habitats. We are also responsible for monitoring and updating the Important Bird Areas network in Greece and have achieved the designation of the majority of these IBAs as SPAs of the Natura 2000 Network. Recently, it has scanned Greece’s seas in order to designate the marine IBA network!
There is therefore a strong, committed and experienced team at HOS that has taken on the task of implementing the campaign.
 
What we have done so far against illegal killing
HOS has campaigned against illegal killing of wild birds throughout its work since 1983. More specifically, HOS has applied pressure to the national and local authorities in order to improve the transposition of the EU’s Birds Directive (that is, the oldest European legislation tool for the protection of biodiversity!) and to actually implement it on the ground.
Illegal killing in the Ionian Islands has been a key media action of HOS every year for the last four years, as we are seeing the Turtle Dove population rapidly reducing. However, more recently HOS has undertaken a series of data collection, lobbying, capacity building and media actions in order to create a clearer and realistic picture of what is happening on the ground, as well as find what are the exact reasons for not tackling the problem are.
This work has lead us to decide to launch the “Safe Ηaven for Wild Birds” three-year  campaign in August 2012, in order to address the problem in a more coordinated, effective and targeted manner.
The campaign’s overall budget in Greece is 120.000 €. The EU will partially finance the project with the amount of 60.000 €. The remaining amount (60.000€) is self-financed. This is of course a very difficult task due to the economic crisis in Greece and the dropping out of potential greek funders. So, your contribution is absolutely helpful for the continuation and the completion of this campaign!
 
What we will do with YOUR help!
1)      A “Safe Haven for Wild Birds” national campaign. HOS will deliver a three-year campaign that targets hunters associations, visitors, decision makers and the younger generation. The campaign will go through stages of growing level of involvement of the target audiences using a number of different channels and tools: press adverts, TV spot, radio spot, engagement in social networks, and printed materials such as posters and pins.
ESTIMATED COST: 21.000 €
 
2)      Local campaign in the Ionian islands: a series of local events and information kiosks in Zakynthos and Corfu throughout the summer months of the three years of the campaign aim to engage local communities and our volunteers. We will also organize a “training the media” session in Zante in order to increase sensitivity around spring killing in the local media.
ESTIMATED COST: 29,000 €
 
3)      Production of a short documentary in Greece regarding the spring killing of wild birds in the Ionian islands. The documentary will analyze the roots of this illegal activity and give voice to those negatively affected by it. The video will be presented at numerous environmental film festivals and will be available on the project website.
ESTIMATED COST: 13,000 €
 
4)      Environmental education campaign at local level in Greece. The younger generations will be informed though an environmental education package for 250 schools in the Ionian Islands and the local Environmental Education Centers.
ESTIMATED COST: 17,000 €
 
5)      International workshop on Bird Crime in Greece. The workshop will raise the awareness of the law enforcement agencies and the decision makers about the extent of illegal killing of birds in the Mediterranean and will facilitate the exchange of best practices in persecuting the illegal bird killers across the Mediterranean.
ESTIMATED COST: 12,000 €
 
6)      Mobile exhibition in the Ionian Islands: all results of the campaign and the schoolchildren’s paintings that will be produced during the environmental education campaign will be toured in the Ionian Islands during the summer of 2015.
ESTIMATED COST: 5,000 €

Anderson III, founder of Applied Ecotechnical Innovations, inventors of the systems which make the TORCH Town concept not only practical but as far as we can tell, they also make it the safest, most sustainable, cost effective and self sufficient community plan currently available.</p>
<p>I have extensive experience in bioremediation, land, soil and wetland restoration, organic gardening, holisitic medicine, community gardening programs, industrial composting, environmental consultation, and energy efficient engineering.</p>
<p>I work with these technologies on a daily basis. I have had great success with them at many sites over a period of several decades, starting as teen involved in some of the first major bioremediation research and systems in the world.</p>
<p>I also study the history of natural cultures such as my Native American (Cherokee and Powhattan), Celtic and Norse ancestors as well as indigenous cultures throughout the world and the rise and fall of civilizations since ancient times. There is much we can learn from preindustrial cultures.</p>
<p>The TORCH concept and supporting systems combines all of these areas of knowledge and more and builds on current safe stable and proven technologies to bring them to an even greater level of efficiency and cost effectiveness.</p>
<p>To be direct, I have a dream. It's what the American Dream should have been.<br/><br/>I dream of a world where all people, of all ages, nationalities and income levels live in safe, clean, comfortable homes that are storm, hurricane, fire and earthquake resistant, where they have no utility bills, no real estate taxes, no water or sewage bills, where they can pick healthy safe nutritious and delicious food from the gardens on their own roofs and terraces, where people don't have to work two jobs or more hours a week than they choose to support an inflated mortgage and bloated maintenance expenses, where people have time to be with their families, and thus there is less abuse, less divorce, less neglect of children and pets and far fewer strokes, heart attacks and fast food induced obesity.<br/><br/> I dream of a community where people can choose their own pace of life and don't have to be a wage slave chasing a rat race ideal they can never win. I dream of communities where people are not isolated from each other by the way their own homes are built and the need to rush around in metal boxes on wheels that keep us from knowing the people around us. I dream of communities for people, not for cars and glaring billboards of offensively brainwashing advertising. <br/><br/>I dream of a community where people truly have the right to just live, where they don't have to generate a huge cash flow just to keep their own homes. I dream of a community where all people can get around safely year round regardless of weather and where the community structure itself encourages helping each other in their times of need. I dream of a community where the pace of life is our choice, not something forced on us by wage slavery and because of that pace we can choose to spend time on family activities, education, community service, non profit causes or passing on our knowledge and skills to the less fortunate. Such a community allows the elderly, the handicapped and the financially challenged to be a health positively contributing asset of society. I dream of such a community where systemic and social problems are massively reduced because of such benefits. I dream of a community of healthy modern holistic living that reflects values of liberty, equality and compassion.<br/><br/>Most of us have had a similar dream, or portions of what I describe above, perhaps around the time you had your first job. You probably have had a similar dream at one time or another, perhaps as a young child or when you were tired of the rat race of consumer culture, and like me you were probably told its a fairy tale utopia and can't work. Well, the surest way to get me to make something work is to tell me its impossible. I found out how to make it not only possible but healthier and more affordable than modern ""normal"" communities.</p>
<p>I want to share this dream with as many people as possible. Why? I'm no saint. Its easier for us all to have if everyone has it. Its fundamental basic logic. The best way to have something is make sure everyone has it. If everyone has it, I can too. Its also extremely sensible and holds great value for strengthening our society and the stability of the world as a whole, which are also things I personally desire and think we all deserve.</p>
<p>This is why I and others believe it is time we brought this to the people instead of waiting for government or large organizations to wake up to the benefits and value of such communities and infrastructure systems.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to consider what we can achieve with your help.</p>
<p>Funding will support the following:</p>
<p>1. Finalize legal paperwork, patents and blueprints for TORCH Communiites, Bio-Domes Architecture and IOWEBS sustainable energy infrastructure system.</p>
<p>2. Promote the Total Organic Resource Conservation Hamlet Community Concept, and the associated Bio-Domes architecture and IOWEBS sustainable energy community infrastructure at meetings across the US and Canada as determined by contributor votes.</p>
<p>3. This will also allow us to approach existing communities with the IOWEBS system to be added to their existing disposal approach and make it more efficient and eco friendly. Likewise this will also allow us to build Bio.domes homes for people on a standalone basis anywhere they would like one.<br/><br/>Likewise there are three options that could apply to you personally, all while we all benefit as a whole.<br/><br/>1. Living in a TORCH Community.</p>
<p>2. Having a Bio.Domes Architecture house built at your own location.</p>
<p>3. Bringing the benefits to your community, such as 30% APR savings and earnings over normal sewage treatment.</p>
<p>We are starting our crowd source funding program to raise funds to make the IOWEBS and Bio.Domes based TORCH communities a reality using public money and not waiting for organizations and governments. It's our future, we need to make sure it happens instead of waiting and hoping.</p>
<p>We will use the funds raised to finalize all patents and necessary arrangements needed to bring the TORCH concept to a wider range of people and secure additional funding from persons wishing to see such communities built, and live and work in them.</p>
<p>We already have a large number of people that have expressed interest in purchasing homes in such communities and I am sure either you or someone you know would as well. Your assistance will help us make the last steps needed to be able to proceed to purchasing land at the initial sites and selling homes to those who want them, and eventually even construct some as rental properties for those who cannot afford to buy a home yet.</p>
<p>I will be selling my own home to pay for building one for myself. <span>Even with the market down it ends up being profitable to do because these houses are cheaper per square foot, you will never pay property or income tax, a water bill, a sewage bill, energy use is dropped by 95%, maintenance is almost non existent and you grow your own food on your roof or buy from the local community supported agriculture participants and the town farmers market.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The TORCH Community plan includes the IOWEBS Integrated Organic Waste to Energy Biological System and Bio.Domes architecture, a highly efficient earth bermed passive solar design style which should be very familiar to those who love the beauty and peaceful logic of a more natural lifestyle without giving up the benefits of modern civilization.</p>
<p>The end of 2012 is here and the world hasn't ended, it's only the end of a cycle and the start of a new millennium.</p>
<p>However, many factors indicate that civilization as it stands today cannot continue, there are issues that threaten the safety and stability of the world. Many of these already have a strong negative impact on the economy and people's lives.</p>
<p>We believe humanity can face these challenges and conquer them by learning to live more efficiently using the power of Ecotechnical Engineering, of technology in a mutually supportive synergy with nature.</p>
<p>This is what a Total Organic Resource Conservation Hamlet (TORCH) Community does. These are community clusters designed for maximum efficiciency, self reliance, cost effectiveness and minimal ecological impact. The same support systems and infrastructure can also serve larger existing communities as well.</p>
<p>These communities use the best technologies available now, building on the solid foundatoin of the best of the past, to build the best possible future for humanity.</p>
<p>Each community and home built benefits all living things on earth by reducing the impact of humanity and as such helps stabilize the environment, the economy and even national and international security by reducing the need for competition for resources.</p>
<p>These communities help ensure a healthy future environmentally, socially, economically, and thus, personally.</p>
<p>The IOWEBS infrastructure system processes all organic wastes in the community using advanced methane, aquaponics and algae technologies and in so doing produces large amounts of clean energy, irrigation water, industrially composted fertilizer, and provides carbon sequestration all while supporting local agriculture and industry. The IOWEBS system can replace any existing sewage facility and be of direct benefit to any community on earth.</p>
<p>The Bio.Domes home designs provide low impact, low cost, energy efficient, low maintenance and highly disaster resistant homes with such features as 95% energy usage reduction, extreme wind and earthquake resistance, rooftop gardening, rain water capture and passive solar heating. These can also be built for anyone who wants one of their own, not just in TORCH Communities.</p>
<p>Together these provide a level of sustainable self reliance and healthier, lower stress, living that is unmatched in modern society while keeping all the benefits of modern living. These are primarily pedestrian oriented communities with year round underground handicapped accessible entry with local shops, farmers market, park, and a community fountain, and an Inn/Pub gathering hall.</p>
<p>I hope you can help us make it happen for the benefit of all life on earth. It's time for a new beginning, help us build the civilization for this next millennium, one solid step at a time.</p>
<p>Please help however you can, contribute or share this so we can make it a reality. We can't do it without you.</p>
<p>If you wish to contribute at any level and do not wish the reward just let us know. The extra contribution is highly appreciated as well. Likewise if there is a perk you think would be good please let me know. I welcome your thoughts.</p>
<p>We also hope to complete paperwork to make the non-rewarded contributions tax deductible by the time this campaign finishes. If so you will receive proper paperwork to be able to deduct from your taxes.</p>

<p>Where will our children and grandchildren live? All the gadgets and other items are wonderful but they mean nothing if we have no planet on which to live.</p>

<p>It is our responsibility and duty to leave this planet better than it was when it was left to us.</p>
<p>Doxicom and the Greengooroo has been recycling for 4 years. </p>
<p><strong>This is some of what we achieved thus far:</strong></p>
<p>Kept over 14 million pounds of paper out of the landfill. We have saved over 100,000 trees! Our goal is to save 1,000,000 million trees. Just imagine the positive environmental impact.</p>

<p>In an alternative vehicle, we will travel the lower 48 in pursuit of <strong>30 plus stories</strong> to recognize household and business activities that support <strong>community and local resiliency.</strong>  The purpose of this project is to showcase <strong>local, practical, cost effective solutions</strong> to sustainable living including winning examples of using local foods and local energy.</p>
<p>It is these winning examples that will motivate and encourage a more<strong> positive</strong> response to energy security and climate change.  We know that there are technological solutions and top--down incentive programs for environmental action, but the key ingredient is missing: r<strong>eal people doing real work to lessen their impact on the environment.</strong> We're looking for everything from homesteading to up-cycling waste materials, alternative dwellings to local food programs, energy efficiency to alternative transportation, and everything in between.</p>
<p>All of our interviews are compiled onto our website, convenientresilience.com, to achieve the overarching goal of an i<strong>nteractive online resource and guide</strong> for applying these <strong>simple environmental initiatives to anyone’s life.</strong>It is our hope that this guide will act as a <strong>tool and platform for easily sharing knowledge and expertise</strong> across borders and interests.</p>
<p>After interviewing Lori Barg on her solar water heater in Plainfield, VT, we received contact from new friends in Nicaragua. They were so inspired by her simple design that they are looking to implement it across their country as a cost effective method to providing families with hot water.</p>
<p>With your support, we will be able to interview dozens of people across the country. Here is a sneak peek of some of the incredible projects we will be encountering.</p>

It is these winning examples that will motivate and encourage a more positive response to energy security and climate change.  We know that there are technological solutions and top--down incentive programs for environmental action, but the key ingredient is missing: real people doing real work to lessen their impact on the environment. We're looking for everything from homesteading to up-cycling waste materials, alternative dwellings to local food programs, energy efficiency to alternative transportation, and everything in between.
All of our interviews are compiled onto our website, convenientresilience.com, to achieve the overarching goal of an interactive online resource and guide for applying these simple environmental initiatives to anyone’s life.It is our hope that this guide will act as a tool and platform for easily sharing knowledge and expertise across borders and interests.
After interviewing Lori Barg on her solar water heater in Plainfield, VT, we received contact from new friends in Nicaragua. They were so inspired by her simple design that they are looking to implement it across their country as a cost effective method to providing families with hot water.
With your support, we will be able to interview dozens of people across the country. Here is a sneak peek of some of the incredible projects we will be encountering.


Budget: 
$6,000-8,000 purchase of a vehicle
$2,000- fuel and maintenance/tolls on the road
$500- insurance
$2,000- food (10/day/per/100 days)
$1,000- camp lodging
$1,500- technology

<p>Pierrette, the founder of PAC, was widowed in 2012, left with 5 young children, no family, and no employment prospects. She struggled to feed her children and pay for medicine, education, and other expenses, as she scraped by doing odd jobs for neighboring households, many of which were headed by women in similarly dire situations.</p>
<p>In 2013, she participated in a training on processing Moringa into powder, where she learned about the nutritional benefits of Moringa leaves. Moringa already grew sporadically in her neighborhood, so she began incorporating the leaves into meals she served to her children, and she witnessed a remarkable difference in her family’s well-being. Here is where she saw an opportunity to use what she learned in the training to both create an income source for herself, and help all the women she met around the community since the death of her husband by providing them extra income and a powerful supplement to the daily nutrition of their children.</p>
<p>Today, PAC consists of a fast-growing network of women who produce Moringa leaves, creating significant economic value and improvements in family health, all out of the modest assets held by these women. PAC’s activities have garnered the attention of export partners in the USA and Europe, which has redefined its vision and shown the possibility that even more families can benefit from Moringa, beyond Dassa, and beyond Benin.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal of exportation, we are looking to you. We have already raised $10,000 through a Peace Corps grant but have estimated another $5,000 needed to fulfill our dream and build a top of the line Moringa Processing Center. The current center is an old home built without the intention of processing high grade moringa powder. Even with all hygienic procedures being taken by workers, it is impossible for us to achieve the quality powder needed for US standards while working in that building. The blueprint has been approved by experts in the field who all assure that with this new center, our moringa will be as clean as it gets.</p>
<p>Once the construction is completed (after an estimated 4 months), we will be able to increase the quality and quantity of moringa powder produced and start exporting moringa powder to partners around the world. With a stable market, we can take on more suppliers and give potentially hundreds more struggling mothers the opportunity to gain a supplemental income to feed their families and pay school fees.</p>
<p>Even if you are not able to currently financially support this project, please pass along this message! Share this link on social media, talk about the power of moringa during your next holiday party... truly, everything helps! </p>

<h3>*See the Updates section to see where we are on the project<br/><br/>How It Started</h3>
<p>What started as a desperate project when I was a homeless single father during the recession has now taken on a life of its own.  When I couldn't find a job as a programmer in time, which I had experience as for 15+ years, I had to make something happen.  So I came up with a plan to make a solar project work with the odd legal barriers in Florida.  I had tinkered with solar projects for 10 years as a hobby, but the very laws that made solar installation difficult in Florida led me to the idea: to build zero-energy apartments.  The plans have been ready for 2 years, but I was battling my way back to a normal life, and wanted to contribute my own money to the project.  Thanks to an inheritance, things are moving ahead, but I still need help to finish the first apartment.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am putting down $100,000 myself, but the total project will cost about $2 million.  In order to be financed, we will need 20% down.  There are interested potential investors, but we could use your help.<br/><br/>Your contributions would not only help me, and the environment, from this one building.  I have always planned to copy these buildings as fast as possible to have more sustainable buildings out there, and to do so, I will be starting a franchise.  It is the fastest way to expand ideas, and with each building providing 80kW of solar power, and each apartment complex providing 1-2 Megawatts of solar power (it's like a small power plant!), it may even be able to rival the output of large power plants as the franchise grows.<br/><br/>So you not only help, but we will do our best to make sure you get a chance to live in a zero-energy apartment.  We will have a waiting list on our website that tracks demand by zip code.  With your $20 contribution, you will be the very first on that waiting list.  When they start to see, say, 400 people on the waiting list in one zip code, developers will have a very compelling reason to build ZEAL Apartments there, and banks will have a compelling reason to back them.  So go tell your friends, too!  The waiting list will continue after the campaign, but IGG contributors will always be at the top of the list.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While there have been net-zero buildings both residential and commercial, they are still few and far between, and most are individual projects.  The economics of this project, however, makes it extremely competitive commercially.  Developers who become franchisees benefit from:</p>
<ul>
<li>A higher expected return on their investment (ROI)</li>
<li>Empty units still produce $50-150 worth of electricity at current rates</li>
<li>High demand for green buildings, and other extra competitive features.</li>
</ul>
<p>When developers see there is clearly more money to be made by going sustainable, they will be pushing the technology out faster than any individual can hope.  And by joining the franchise, their franchise fees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help advertise and encourage more sustainable building</li>
<li>Help fund R&amp;D to improve ZEAL Apartments sustainability even more!</li>
<li>A portion of each franchise fee goes to help house the homeless</li>
</ul>
<p>But developers want to see proof, and that's why getting this first building built is so important.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>By far the most dangerous part is the same as any real estate development. Underestimating the costs, getting it partially built, and then being unable to fund the final part.  I am working with very experienced architects, general contractors, and solar installers, that are all experienced in net-zero construction.  Please check them out on the Team page, they're a wonderful crew.  And we're being conservative with all the investments to be safe.<br/><br/>Hitting the milestones for commercial competitiveness is a concern, but one that should easily be covered.  At the beginning of development two years ago, there was much less room for error.  But even in just two years, the drop in price and increase in solar panel efficiency have made that significantly easier.  We will probably end up producing almost 50% more electricity than we use, but that's why the data from the first building is so valuable to the future.<br/><br/>And the mental barriers of the cost still need to be watched, though they also look good.  There is a huge difference with people paying 10% more for their rent + utilities, or paying 10% less.  No one wants to pay more, but give someone better quality for less money, and who wouldn't go for that?  The same goes for developers making 2% less ROI, though demand *might* make up for it, or making 5% more, while still getting that same high demand.  We expect to hit both those marks, but the focus needs to stay on making sure that happens.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you can't contribute now, that's ok.  Spreading the word helps just as much.  Especially if you'd like to live in a ZEAL Apartment, and you know others in your area that would like to.  Tell them about the campaign, and there will always be more chances to reserve your spot.  And even if you don't think there's any way you can contribute, even a kind word helps brighten my day.  Thank you all for your help!<br/> <div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/AY5kSiyfbJY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>

Underestimating the costs, getting it partially built, and then being unable to fund the final part.  I am working with very experienced architects, general contractors, and solar installers, that are all experienced in net-zero construction.  Please check them out on the Team page, they're a wonderful crew.  And we're being conservative with all the investments to be safe.Hitting the milestones for commercial competitiveness is a concern, but one that should easily be covered.  At the beginning of development two years ago, there was much less room for error.  But even in just two years, the drop in price and increase in solar panel efficiency have made that significantly easier.  We will probably end up producing almost 50% more electricity than we use, but that's why the data from the first building is so valuable to the future.And the mental barriers of the cost still need to be watched, though they also look good.  There is a huge difference with people paying 10% more for their rent + utilities, or paying 10% less.  No one wants to pay more, but give someone better quality for less money, and who wouldn't go for that?  The same goes for developers making 2% less ROI, though demand *might* make up for it, or making 5% more, while still getting that same high demand.  We expect to hit both those marks, but the focus needs to stay on making sure that happens.
 

Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute now, that's ok.  Spreading the word helps just as much.  Especially if you'd like to live in a ZEAL Apartment, and you know others in your area that would like to.  Tell them about the campaign, and there will always be more chances to reserve your spot.  And even if you don't think there's any way you can contribute, even a kind word helps brighten my day.  Thank you all for your help!",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

<br/><p>In order to keep this contest running and to reach out to more people than ever before, Get to Know relies on partners and donations. We have a two-fold approach for getting more youth involved in the 2014 contest: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">one is by running events such as Art in the Park as well as Launch and Congratulations Events; </span><br/>

</li>
</ul>
<br/>With your generosity, we hope to be able to expand our outreach to get more children outdoors making meaningful memories in nature. We are hoping to beat last year’s 5900 contest entries. In fact, <b>our goal is to reach 10,000 entries this year.</b> Think about it. That's 10,000 connections to nature, 10,000 moments where a child connected with their surroundings and felt inspired. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We hope you will consider donating to help us to make this year's contest better than ever.</span>

<p>You work hard for your cash and we want to be open with you about exactly where it is going. First you should know that we are a registered charity in Canada (874935521RR0001 under <i>Wild Neighbours Society</i> and in the States we are a project of <i>The Community Partners </i>(95-4302067). We’re based in Canada, and that’s why the fundraiser is in CAD.</p>
<p>The funds raised in this campaign will go towards promoting the contest and running events to get more youth involved in the contest, as well as to offset the costs of actually running the contest. This includes website upkeep, social media outreach, and costs associated with prizes for the contest.</p>
<p>As we said before, we have a two-fold approach for this: one way is through running events. We have to pay for space rentals, art supplies, presentation fees, and sometimes snacks at these events. We get volunteers to help out and often receive discounted rates on rentals, but as a charity we rely on your support to be able to pay for the remaining fees.</p>

Let's have fun with this and see if we can make it work.  It only takes a second to donate to the campaign. When you reach the payment part you can use PayPal, Mastercard, Visa and other easy methods. You will either be able to follow the success on this site or, if you donate, even $1, I will put your email on my list and keep you informed of the successes in much more detail.</p><p>My mind seems to ""kick in"" under pressure.  I am under pressure and this is where I ended up. Maybe, just maybe, I can bring my project which has been going on for years and costing me thousands of dollars, to a successful conclusion and move into the next phase.  </p><p>Every once in a while, I buy a power ball ticket.  I am not a gambler so I want instant gratification for my purchase. I always get my $2 worth.  Just dreaming of who I would help and how I would help others with needs, how my church would use the 10% they would receive, and yes, what I would indulge myself in. While I never expect to win, I always have more than my $2 worth of fun thinking about what I would do if I did.</p><p>I'm kind of hoping you may feel the same way about pitching in a couple bucks to my worthy cause and then smiling when you watch the success.  I assume you are at the very least, curious, just as I am.  At some point everyone either decides to go to Costa Rica or has a friend or family member who is going. By being part of this campaign, you, your family and your friends are connected.  You can say, with confidence: ""I have a connection in Costa Rica and they may be able to give you some insight on your trip"". I plan to be here a while and will be ready and willing to help when I can. </p><p>You can replay the video as many times as you want and each time make a visit in your mind to this, most special place on the earth.  On those long cold winter nights, you can play the attached video and say to yourself: ""some day I am going to call Jim and make a plan to come down to indulge in the pure and preserved nature immersed experience"". You can know that it is 80 degrees and brimming with color at La Cuesta Roja no matter how cold or bleek it is out your front window. While you are watching the video, you will be knowing that you have been a part in protecting La Cuesta Roja for years and years to come.

Let's have fun with this and see if we can make it work.  It only takes a second to donate to the campaign. When you reach the payment part you can use PayPal, Mastercard, Visa and other easy methods. You will either be able to follow the success on this site or, if you donate, even $1, I will put your email on my list and keep you informed of the successes in much more detail.My mind seems to ""kick in"" under pressure.  I am under pressure and this is where I ended up. Maybe, just maybe, I can bring my project which has been going on for years and costing me thousands of dollars, to a successful conclusion and move into the next phase.  Every once in a while, I buy a power ball ticket.  I am not a gambler so I want instant gratification for my purchase. I always get my $2 worth.  Just dreaming of who I would help and how I would help others with needs, how my church would use the 10% they would receive, and yes, what I would indulge myself in. While I never expect to win, I always have more than my $2 worth of fun thinking about what I would do if I did.I'm kind of hoping you may feel the same way about pitching in a couple bucks to my worthy cause and then smiling when you watch the success.  I assume you are at the very least, curious, just as I am.  At some point everyone either decides to go to Costa Rica or has a friend or family member who is going. By being part of this campaign, you, your family and your friends are connected.  You can say, with confidence: ""I have a connection in Costa Rica and they may be able to give you some insight on your trip"". I plan to be here a while and will be ready and willing to help when I can. You can replay the video as many times as you want and each time make a visit in your mind to this, most special place on the earth.  On those long cold winter nights, you can play the attached video and say to yourself: ""some day I am going to call Jim and make a plan to come down to indulge in the pure and preserved nature immersed experience"". You can know that it is 80 degrees and brimming with color at La Cuesta Roja no matter how cold or bleek it is out your front window. While you are watching the video, you will be knowing that you have been a part in protecting La Cuesta Roja for years and years to come. Better yet, you can spend some time planning on just how you will make it a reality and come stay at this incredible location which I hope to preserve for many generations.My name is easy to remember: James Cameron.  I am also googleable for background.  I am a 67 year old semi retired ex-coffee roaster from Wisconsin now living in Costa Rica (it's that winter thing).  I have been coming to Costa Rica for 40 years; many of the trips for my former coffee roasting company: Cameron's Coffee Co., Inc.

<p>Just instantly dip the battery in a glass of water, in a stream, in a river, in the sea, or simply wet it with the running water from a faucet, a watering hose, etc. In case of emergency, you can even urinate on 
it! What’s more, any other conventional liquid will work too! </p>
<p>The battery will instantly start producing electricity which will last for as long as the sponge inside the battery is wet. This practically means that the battery can keep going for days, depending on the climate. When you see that there’s a drop in the output, simply re-wet the battery! In addition, if you leave the battery to dry out completely, it will provide at its maximum power when you re-wet it.<br/></p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 110%;""><b>Disruptive Technology</b></span>
<p>Our battery is set to rock the world! </p>
<p>It is the only rechargeable (open type) battery that is activated with water, or any other liquid, and has been patented as such. Beside water, the H2Only Battery requires oxygen to operate, hence the term 'open type'.<br/></p>
<p>Unlike all other batteries in the market, the H2Only Battery:</p>
<ul style="""">
<li>does not contain any acidic or toxic chemicals</li>
<li>emits no toxic pollutants</li>
<li>is not explosive</li>
<li>has a very low Cost to Longevity ratio</li>
<li>does not lose its properties even if unused and is not subject to ageing</li>
<li>has a lifespan of decades depending on usage</li>
<li>takes seconds to charge</li>
<li>does not require a protection circuit to maintain output within limits</li>
<li>is fully recyclable and safe for the environment</li>

<p>We have been working on the H2Only Battery and its applications for the past 6 years. We have achieved tremendous breakthroughs and have overcome all technological barriers.</p>
<p>But now, we need your help. Your support will allow us to gather the funds required to lead us into manufacturing so we can make our H2Only Battery available to you and the millions of people who seek a piece of mind in an emergency, or even 
more who are deprived of electricity in their homes.</p>
<p>We are out on a mission. We intend to partner with leading Organizations in order to provide at least one ‘H2Only Battery LIGHT’ to homes in Africa that do not have electricity. Help us help people, provide piece of mind to people and make this breakthrough something that will rock the world! 
</p>
<p>We have designed our Indiegogo Campaign Perks so that you will benefit two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will get the FLASHLIGHT and/or the LIGHT at a price lower than the retail prices.</li>
<li>Depending on the Perk you select, you will also contribute to helping people (Africa to start with) by offering them a necessity that they don’t have: light. We call our Cause: LIGHT Africa!</li>
</ul><p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 110%;""><b>Why should you support us?</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You have had cases when you needed to have light - perhaps in an emergency or in a blackout, and you either did not have it or you wished you had changed your leaking batteries… </li>
<li>You are conscious about not polluting the environment and strive to help as much possible to save our planet.</li>
<li>You want to help people who are deprived of the simplest necessities such as electricity.</li>
</ul><p>We cordially thank you for your support!</p>
<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 120%;""><b>Questions and Answers</b></span><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 110%;""><b>1. Purchasing &amp; Use (Quantity, Colors, etc.)</b></span>
</p><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">How many ‘H2Only Battery’ devices do I need?</b><br/></p><p>
If we were to compare our Battery to anything, that would be with a pair of running shoes! They both need some rest. That’s why for all our devices which will undergo continuous use – such as the LIGHT – we include 2 sets of ‘H2Only Batteries’ in the kit, so that you can interchange them.</p>
<p>So, after you’ve used the one set for 2-3 days, you will be able to prolong its lifespan if you let it dry out completely and use the second set in the interim.</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">How long will the ‘H2Only Battery’ last?</b><br/>
This depends on many factors, the most important being Usage. Other, less important factors are weather conditions and type of liquid used to activate.</p>
<p>For example, the FLASHLIGHT will probably not be used on a daily basis, but rather occasionally. This means that once it is activated and used, it will dry out completely. This FLASHLIGHT can last for many decades without the need to purchase a replacement H2Only Battery. In effect, you will have a FLASHLIGHT for the rest of your life!</p>
<p>On the other hand, the LIGHT will probably be used on a daily basis for 6+ hours every night, especially in regions without electricity. The proper use in this case would be to run the LIGHT on Battery no. 1 for 2-3 days, and then switch to Battery no. 2 (included in the kit) for the following 2-3 days. If possible, depending on weather conditions, it would be ideal to alternate the Batteries every day. In this way, the LIGHT will keep going for at least 3 months.</p>
<p>It should be apparent that weather conditions also affect the performance. In very hot climates, water evaporates very fast; so on the one hand, rewetting of the H2Only Battery will be more frequent, but on the other hand, the H2Only Battery will perform more because it will dry out sooner completing more dry-to-wet cycles. Remember we said that drying out the battery completely prolongs its lifespan?</p>
<p>The type of liquid plays a big role in the longevity of the H2Only Battery. We recommend activating the battery with simple water. Sea water will also work, yet the salt will cause the H2Only Battery to have a less number of restarts. We have designed the H2Only Battery to be able to be activated with any ‘normal’ liquid. This means that in case of an emergency, urine will also work!</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">What happens when my ‘H2Only Battery’ runs out?</b>
<br/>
Here’s the best part! Our H2Only Battery is fully recyclable. What this means is that you can send it back to us and we’ll send you a new H2Only Battery at reduced price. If you want to keep your old one, go ahead! We’ll still send you a new one at reduced price; but you will not have contributed to saving the environment. Think about it!<br/></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Will it replace the conventional flashlight or light that I have?</b>
<br/>
The intention of our invention is to provide electricity when it’s required, when either the power grid fails, or … when there’s no power grid, or … you just want to save on your electricity bill. The feedback from our testers has shown that after a short while, you will get to love the FLASHLIGHT and the LIGHT so much, that you’ll wonder why on earth you did not have one before!</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Can I choose what color I want?</b><br/>
Absolutely! The various color variations are listed and shown above. There is no standard color, so make sure you specify what color you want.</p>
<p>Should however the color of your choice is not be available, we will let you know. You may then chose to wait for the backordered item or select another color.""<br/></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Can anyone use the H2Only Battery?</b><br/></p>
<p> Absolutely! The thought behind inventing the ‘H2Only Battery’ is that it should be a device that can be activated even by a small child. We were amazed when at some point during the prototype testing phase, the 2-year old daughter of one of the Team members asked to have the FLASHLIGHT, was told that it does not work, and instantly stated “Well, put it in water Daddy!” It’s that easy!</p>

What are the uses for the 'H2Only Battery’?
If you think about it, the uses of such an amazing invention are pretty much endless. What’s awesome is that the battery can take any shape or size! We can even manufacture custom batteries depending on the power requirement!
Personal Use –


Outdoor and Patio Lighting (rain can activate it too!)
Camping; Fishing; Hunting; Outdoor Activities
Sports (visibility lights for runners, cyclists, etc.)
Mobile Chargers, e.g. for mobile phones 
Personal Survival Equipment (survival kits; it even works with urine!)
Emergency lighting for when electricity is out 
Power source for every household appliance with low voltage demands, e.g. radios
The list is endless!
Commercial Use –

Emergency Lighting, e.g. elevators, buildings when electricity is out
Airport Emergency Lighting (military and civilian) 
Lighthouses 
Street Signage 
Automotive (emergency triangle, flashlight, jump-start battery)
Lights for Ships with no generators, e.g. sailing 
Monasteries and Places with no electricity 
Survival Equipment – 

Military Survival Kits (carried-on or in vehicles)
General Survival Equipment (survival kits, life vests in ships and airplanes)
Evacuation Lifeboats (ships and airplanes) 
Lights for Shelters, Tunnels, Naval Lenses 
How does the 'H2Only Battery’ work?
Just instantly dip the battery in a glass of water, in a stream, in a river, in the sea, or simply wet it with the running water from a faucet, a watering hose, etc. In case of emergency, you can even urinate on 
it! What’s more, any other conventional liquid will work too! 
The battery will instantly start producing electricity which will last for as long as the sponge inside the battery is wet. This practically means that the battery can keep going for days, depending on the climate. When you see that there’s a drop in the output, simply re-wet the battery! In addition, if you leave the battery to dry out completely, it will provide at its maximum power when you re-wet it.
Disruptive Technology
Our battery is set to rock the world! 
It is the only rechargeable (open type) battery that is activated with water, or any other liquid, and has been patented as such. Beside water, the H2Only Battery requires oxygen to operate, hence the term 'open type'.
Unlike all other batteries in the market, the H2Only Battery:

does not contain any acidic or toxic chemicals
emits no toxic pollutants
is not explosive
has a very low Cost to Longevity ratio
does not lose its properties even if unused and is not subject to ageing
has a lifespan of decades depending on usage
takes seconds to charge
does not require a protection circuit to maintain output within limits
is fully recyclable and safe for the environment

Why We Need Your Support?
We have been working on the H2Only Battery and its applications for the past 6 years. We have achieved tremendous breakthroughs and have overcome all technological barriers.
But now, we need your help. Your support will allow us to gather the funds required to lead us into manufacturing so we can make our H2Only Battery available to you and the millions of people who seek a piece of mind in an emergency, or even 
more who are deprived of electricity in their homes.
We are out on a mission. We intend to partner with leading Organizations in order to provide at least one ‘H2Only Battery LIGHT’ to homes in Africa that do not have electricity. Help us help people, provide piece of mind to people and make this breakthrough something that will rock the world! 

We have designed our Indiegogo Campaign Perks so that you will benefit two-fold:

You will get the FLASHLIGHT and/or the LIGHT at a price lower than the retail prices.
Depending on the Perk you select, you will also contribute to helping people (Africa to start with) by offering them a necessity that they don’t have: light. We call our Cause: LIGHT Africa!

Why should you support us?

You have had cases when you needed to have light - perhaps in an emergency or in a blackout, and you either did not have it or you wished you had changed your leaking batteries… 
You are conscious about not polluting the environment and strive to help as much possible to save our planet.
You want to help people who are deprived of the simplest necessities such as electricity.
We cordially thank you for your support!
Questions and Answers1. Purchasing & Use (Quantity, Colors, etc.)
How many ‘H2Only Battery’ devices do I need?
If we were to compare our Battery to anything, that would be with a pair of running shoes! They both need some rest. That’s why for all our devices which will undergo continuous use – such as the LIGHT – we include 2 sets of ‘H2Only Batteries’ in the kit, so that you can interchange them.
So, after you’ve used the one set for 2-3 days, you will be able to prolong its lifespan if you let it dry out completely and use the second set in the interim.
How long will the ‘H2Only Battery’ last?
This depends on many factors, the most important being Usage. Other, less important factors are weather conditions and type of liquid used to activate.
For example, the FLASHLIGHT will probably not be used on a daily basis, but rather occasionally. This means that once it is activated and used, it will dry out completely. This FLASHLIGHT can last for many decades without the need to purchase a replacement H2Only Battery. In effect, you will have a FLASHLIGHT for the rest of your life!
On the other hand, the LIGHT will probably be used on a daily basis for 6+ hours every night, especially in regions without electricity. The proper use in this case would be to run the LIGHT on Battery no. 1 for 2-3 days, and then switch to Battery no. 2 (included in the kit) for the following 2-3 days. If possible, depending on weather conditions, it would be ideal to alternate the Batteries every day. In this way, the LIGHT will keep going for at least 3 months.
It should be apparent that weather conditions also affect the performance. In very hot climates, water evaporates very fast; so on the one hand, rewetting of the H2Only Battery will be more frequent, but on the other hand, the H2Only Battery will perform more because it will dry out sooner completing more dry-to-wet cycles. Remember we said that drying out the battery completely prolongs its lifespan?
The type of liquid plays a big role in the longevity of the H2Only Battery. We recommend activating the battery with simple water. Sea water will also work, yet the salt will cause the H2Only Battery to have a less number of restarts. We have designed the H2Only Battery to be able to be activated with any ‘normal’ liquid. This means that in case of an emergency, urine will also work!
What happens when my ‘H2Only Battery’ runs out?

Here’s the best part! Our H2Only Battery is fully recyclable. What this means is that you can send it back to us and we’ll send you a new H2Only Battery at reduced price. If you want to keep your old one, go ahead! We’ll still send you a new one at reduced price; but you will not have contributed to saving the environment. Think about it!
Will it replace the conventional flashlight or light that I have?

The intention of our invention is to provide electricity when it’s required, when either the power grid fails, or … when there’s no power grid, or … you just want to save on your electricity bill. The feedback from our testers has shown that after a short while, you will get to love the FLASHLIGHT and the LIGHT so much, that you’ll wonder why on earth you did not have one before!
Can I choose what color I want?
Absolutely! The various color variations are listed and shown above. There is no standard color, so make sure you specify what color you want.
Should however the color of your choice is not be available, we will let you know. You may then chose to wait for the backordered item or select another color.""
Can anyone use the H2Only Battery?
 Absolutely! The thought behind inventing the ‘H2Only Battery’ is that it should be a device that can be activated even by a small child. We were amazed when at some point during the prototype testing phase, the 2-year old daughter of one of the Team members asked to have the FLASHLIGHT, was told that it does not work, and instantly stated “Well, put it in water Daddy!” It’s that easy!
2. Buying & Shipping (Shipping costs, International, Timeline)
What are the shipping costs?
 
For all shipping costs across the world please see each Perk, so please make sure you include that with your order. We don’t anticipate that there will be any extra charges for customs, yet please note that shipment does not include extra fees from customs, or additional costs associated with your country. If it turns out that shipment to your country proves too expensive, we will reimburse your order.
When is the soonest I can get the Flashlight or the Light?

<p><span>Our plan is to raise enough money to install solar panels on our roof.  Then, for the next 10 years, use the income produced by selling 100% of the energy produced by the solar panels to help low-income people around the world who need the money for their own entrepreneurial  projects and who don’t have access to typical banking services.  We would use micro-financing sites like KIVA.org where the people we assist pay us back slowly over time with their profits.  This allows us to take those payments and re-invest them back into more micro-financing projects to help more people.  </span></p>
<p><span>Microfinance is based on the idea that low-income individuals are capable of lifting themselves out of poverty if given access to financial services.  We discovered that we could help the most people by going the micro-financing route. By putting all those micro-payments back into the pot, we could in 10 years help over 18,000 people with close to half-a-million dollars!  All with a one time investment in a solar installation!</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><strong>The Details:</strong></p>
<p><span>Through a special government incentive program, we can secure a 20 year contract with our local hydro company that will pay 54.9 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for all energy produced by the solar panels</span>.  ( This is a good rate considering we are currently paying between 6.5 cents to 11.7 cents per kWh for energy consumed in our home).</p>
<p><span>The roof is perfectly south-facing and capable of holding a 9.75 kW system.  It is estimated that this system will earn $485.50 per month (averaged over the length of the contract since summer months will earn more than winter months for example).</span></p>
<p><span>To install the solar array it would cost $54,440.  It would take 10 years to pay off the system with our earnings of $485.50 per month.</span></p>
<p><span>We don’t have $54,440 lying around.</span></p>
<p><span>So, my plan is to raise the money to pay for the solar installation, and for the next 10 years use the income from the solar panels to help low-income people around the world who need the money for their own projects and don’t have access to typical banking services.  We would use micro-financing sites like KIVA.org where the people we assist pay us back slowly over time with their profits.  This allows us to take those payments and re-invest them back into more micro-financing projects to help more people.  </span></p>

<p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Why KIVA?</em><br/><br/>Of all the microfinancing sites out there right now KIVA has the most people needing loans, and as those people pay back their loans (a little each month), KIVA gives it back to us (so each of those monthly micropayments will add up enabling us to help more people every month instead of waiting for the full loan to be paid back before we can invest in someone new).  In addition to <a href=""http://www.kiva.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kiva.org</a>, we will consider other micro-lending sites too – right now we are looking at <a href=""http://www.zidisha.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zidisha.org</a>, <a href=""http://www.energyincommon.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.energyincommon.org</a> (I personally like this because it is specifically for green microfinancing – which can help people and do more to help the environment – similar to Kiva’s green specific loans too - <a href=""http://www.kiva.org/green"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.kiva.org/green</a>. Unfortunately they give us back the money after the entire loan is paid back, so it will slightly slow down the number of people we can help, and they currently have very few borrowers - but perhaps we can help the few they do have?!?!?)  and <a href=""http://www.vittana.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.vittana.org/</a> (instead of investing in a business, this site lets you invest in education. This also has a longer payback period which slows down our goal of diretly helping 18,000 people in 10 years).<br/><br/>Plus, things will change over 10 years... there may be new sites, improved services, etc. We will endeavour to use whatever services we deem to be the best to meet our goals. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Why 10 years?</em><br/><br/>If I had the money to pay for the solar installation myself, it would take 10 years to earn that money back.  By raising the money via IndieGoGo , instead of paying myself back, we would use the 10 years of income to help others.  And by using micro-financing to do it – the $57,500 raised can become $450,000 in aid to people in need.  </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span><em> What happens after 10 years?</em><br/><br class=""_mce_tagged_br""/> Well, we don’t have a crystal ball, so we will decide at that time what we will do with any income or remaining funds.  We will first pay back everyone who donated $1000 or more. Then we will pay ourselves back for any costs that we had to pay out-of-pocket over the last 10 years (for example: if we had to repair the system). We may decide to upgrade the system assuming there is improved technology after 10 years. If there is a surplus we may decide to keep investing it, or donate part of it to charity.  We will have to see what the future holds.  But for now, we are promising to run this project for 10 years – that is 120 months of investing and reinvesting to people in need while helping the environment at the same time :o)<br/><br/><br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span>In the ""Perks"" section you say my donation will be multiplied 7.73 times.  What does that mean?<br/><br/>By re-investing the money that is paid back to us every month, we will be re-investing the same money into more and more people in need.  Over the 10 years, your money will be reinvested 7.73 times.  So, for example, a $100 donation will at first help 4 people (at $25 each), but as each of those 4 people pay us back a little micorpayment every month, it willl take just 4 months to have enough money to help one more person. By continuing to reinvest the micropayments over 10 years that $100 loan will have helped 30 people with $773.  <br/><br/><br/><br/></span></li>
<li><span><em>You said the solar installation would cost $54,440, but you are asking for $57,500.  Why?  </em><br/><br/>The actual cost of the solar installation is estimated at $47,677.  With tax and fees that grows to the $54,440 mentioned. Add onto that the fee Indiegogo will take for the fundraising platform, we will need to raise US$57,500 on Indiegogo to cover the costs of the solar installation.  See the ""Gallery"" for a more detailed breakdown.<br/><br/><br/></span></li>
<li>
<em>What kind of solar panels and what company is doing the installation?</em><br/><br/>We are looking at an array of 39 Siliken 250W panels, with an Enphase M215 inverter. <br/><br/>The company we are planning to use is:  Eco Alternative Energy   <a href=""http://www.ecoaltenergy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ecoaltenergy.com<br/><br/></a>The hydro will be contected to: Festival Hydro <a href=""http://www.festivalhydro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.festivalhydro.com<br/></a><a href=""http://www.festivalhydro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/><br/><br/></a>
</li>
<li>
<em>Are we guaranteed that the rooftop solar panels will earn that much over 10 years?<br/><br/></em>Yes, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA) is giving 20 year contracts paying 54.9 cents per kilowatt hour.  We can fit 9.75 kilowatt panels on the perfectly south facing roof which is at a 26.5 pitch in full sun. This will earn us $485.50 per month on average (we will, for example, earn more in the summer than in the winter, and we will earn more in the early days when the panels are new. But this will all average out to $485.50 per month).<br/><br/>Go here for more information on the OPA's microFIT program:<br/><a href=""http://microfit.powerauthority.on.ca/about-microfit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://microfit.powerauthority.on.ca/about-microfit</a><br/><br/>Go here to see the pricing plan.  We are at the top of the list:  less than 10 kilowatt hour, rooftop solar system.<br/><a href=""http://microfit.powerauthority.on.ca/sites/default/files/news/FIT-mFITPriceScheduleV2.0.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://microfit.powerauthority.on.ca/sites/default/files/news/FIT-mFITPriceScheduleV2.0.pdf</a><br/><br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<em>What about the solar panels degrading over time?</em><br/><br/>Yes, Solar panels do degrade slightly each year (it’s expected).  But that has been taken into account when the numbers were crunched to come up with the $485.50 monthly income.  Siliken warranties that in year 1, we will get at least 97% of rated output, and in years 2-25, 0.7% per annum reduction.  In the attached proposal (see the Gallery page), you’ll notice that it was taken into account .5% reduction per annum over 20 years (which the installer says is probably a little more realistic.  If a solar manufacturer offers 0.7% per annum, you can expect that you will do better as they do not want to be replacing panels unless they absolutely have to).<br/><br/>In fact, since the $485.50 per month calculated earnings were averaged over 20 years and the panels should earn more in the early years, we should earn more in the first 10 years - which means we could help even more people with more money than the calculations show!  Whoo hoo!<br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<em><em>What if something breaks or the panels don't last that</em></em> long or the roof needs replacing?<br/><br/>The roof was reshingled last year, so we should be good for about 20 years.  <br/><br/>There is a 10 year limited warranty on materials and workmanship for the Siliken 250W Solar panels, so we should be ok for the 10 years of the project.<br/><br/>The Enphase micro-inverters (M215’s) are the latest design and come with a 25 year replacement warranty and free monitoring, meaning that for 25 years, we are completely covered.  If any of the micro-inverters were to go in 25 years, they actually would pay the installer to go out to our roof and replace them.  <br/><br/>Plus, Eco Alternative Energy provides a full 2 year warranty on the installation (labour and parts).<br/><br/>In addition, we will purchase insurance (about $100 per year that I will pay personally) to cover the cost of roof and panel replacement in case of an unforseen accident.<br/><br/>So, we should be covered for the full 10 years of the project!  <br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<em>What if you earn more money?  Or earn less than expected?</em><br/><br/>All money earned from this project will go to the project.  We won't keep any of it.  We may earn more or less than expected, but all of it will go to helping people in need through micro-financing.  Hopefully, we will have some extra sunny days and be able to help even more people than we are expecting, and maybe even crack the half-million dollar mark! <br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<em>What is the environmental benefit?</em><br/><br/>Annually, the solar energy will produce enough energy to power 371 houses for a day. (3710 over the 10 years)<br/><br/>It will offset 17,133 pounds of carbon every year.  The equivalent of 196 trees.  (that is 171,330 pounds of carbon and 1,960 trees over the 10 years of the project).<br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>How do the solar panels remove Carbon from our air?</em><br/><br/>Ok, you caught me... they don’t actually “Remove” the carbon that is currently in our air, but by providing energy from solar panels we will replace the energy provided by those heavily polluting coal burning plants.  So we are really PREVENTING 1428 pounds of carbon from entering our air each month and not REMOVING existing carbon.  <br/><br/><br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<em>Will I get to have a say in who and where the money is given?</em><br/><br/>Yes and No.  We expect that the monthly re-investments in people will be a lot of work as the project grows and there is more and more money to loan to people every month.  We don't want to slow the process down by having to constantly consult with a world-wide committee every week.  However, we would welcome suggestions from anyone who donated to this project.  And, if we are unsure of whether or not to loan in a certain way (for example, through a new micro-financing route), we may choose to put out a survey to all of the supporters to this project and our direction will be dictated by where the majority of the survey votes want us to go. <br/><br/>So yes, we will consider your suggestions, and you may get to vote on who, where and how we loan or donate our monies throughout the project. </li>

Through a special government incentive program, we can secure a 20 year contract with our local hydro company that will pay 54.9 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for all energy produced by the solar panels.  ( This is a good rate considering we are currently paying between 6.5 cents to 11.7 cents per kWh for energy consumed in our home).
The roof is perfectly south-facing and capable of holding a 9.75 kW system.  It is estimated that this system will earn $485.50 per month (averaged over the length of the contract since summer months will earn more than winter months for example).
To install the solar array it would cost $54,440.  It would take 10 years to pay off the system with our earnings of $485.50 per month.
We don’t have $54,440 lying around.
So, my plan is to raise the money to pay for the solar installation, and for the next 10 years use the income from the solar panels to help low-income people around the world who need the money for their own projects and don’t have access to typical banking services.  We would use micro-financing sites like KIVA.org where the people we assist pay us back slowly over time with their profits.  This allows us to take those payments and re-invest them back into more micro-financing projects to help more people.  
Microfinance is based on the idea that low-income individuals are capable of lifting themselves out of poverty if given access to financial services.  We discovered that we could help the most people by going the micro-financing route. By putting all those micro-payments back into the pot, we could in 10 years help over 18000 people with close to half-a-million dollars!  All with a one time $54,400 solar installation!

FAQ:


Why KIVA?Of all the microfinancing sites out there right now KIVA has the most people needing loans, and as those people pay back their loans (a little each month), KIVA gives it back to us (so each of those monthly micropayments will add up enabling us to help more people every month instead of waiting for the full loan to be paid back before we can invest in someone new).  In addition to www.kiva.org, we will consider other micro-lending sites too – right now we are looking at www.zidisha.org, http://www.energyincommon.org (I personally like this because it is specifically for green microfinancing – which can help people and do more to help the environment – similar to Kiva’s green specific loans too - http://www.kiva.org/green. Unfortunately they give us back the money after the entire loan is paid back, so it will slightly slow down the number of people we can help, and they currently have very few borrowers - but perhaps we can help the few they do have?!?!?)  and http://www.vittana.org/ (instead of investing in a business, this site lets you invest in education. This also has a longer payback period which slows down our goal of diretly helping 18,000 people in 10 years).Plus, things will change over 10 years... there may be new sites, improved services, etc. We will endeavour to use whatever services we deem to be the best to meet our goals. 
 


Why 10 years?If I had the money to pay for the solar installation myself, it would take 10 years to earn that money back.  By raising the money via IndieGoGo , instead of paying myself back, we would use the 10 years of income to help others.  And by using micro-financing to do it – the $57,500 raised can become $450,000 in aid to people in need.  
 

 What happens after 10 years? Well, we don’t have a crystal ball, so we will decide at that time what we will do with any income or remaining funds.  We will first pay back everyone who donated $1000 or more. Then we will pay ourselves back for any costs that we had to pay out-of-pocket over the last 10 years (for example: if we had to repair the system). We may decide to upgrade the system assuming there is improved technology after 10 years. If there is a surplus we may decide to keep investing it, or donate part of it to charity.  We will have to see what the future holds.  But for now, we are promising to run this project for 10 years – that is 120 months of investing and reinvesting to people in need while helping the environment at the same time :o)
In the ""Perks"" section you say my donation will be multiplied 7.73 times.  What does that mean?By re-investing the money that is paid back to us every month, we will be re-investing the same money into more and more people in need.  Over the 10 years, your money will be reinvested 7.73 times.  So, for example, a $100 donation will at first help 4 people (at $25 each), but as each of those 4 people pay us back a little micorpayment every month, it willl take just 4 months to have enough money to help one more person. By continuing to reinvest the micropayments over 10 years that $100 loan will have helped 30 people with $773.  
You said the solar installation would cost $54,440, but you are asking for $57,500.  Why?  The actual cost of the solar installation is estimated at $47,677.  With tax and fees that grows to the $54,440 mentioned. Add onto that the fee Indiegogo will take for the fundraising platform, we will need to raise US$57,500 on Indiegogo to cover the costs of the solar installation.  See the ""Gallery"" for a more detailed breakdown.

What kind of solar panels and what company is doing the installation?We are looking at an array of 39 Siliken 250W panels, with an Enphase M215 inverter. The company we are planning to use is:  Eco Alternative Energy   http://www.ecoaltenergy.comThe hydro will be contected to: Festival Hydro http://www.festivalhydro.com


Are we guaranteed that the rooftop solar panels will earn that much over 10 years?Yes, the Ontario Power Authority (OPA) is giving 20 year contracts paying 54.9 cents per kilowatt hour.  We can fit 9.75 kilowatt panels on the perfectly south facing roof which is at a 26.5 pitch in full sun. This will earn us $485.50 per month on average (we will, for example, earn more in the summer than in the winter, and we will earn more in the early days when the panels are new. But this will all average out to $485.50 per month).Go here for more information on the OPA's microFIT program:http://microfit.powerauthority.on.ca/about-microfitGo here to see the pricing plan.  We are at the top of the list:  less than 10 kilowatt hour, rooftop solar system.http://microfit.powerauthority.on.ca/sites/default/files/news/FIT-mFITPriceScheduleV2.0.pdf


What about the solar panels degrading over time?Yes, Solar panels do degrade slightly each year (it’s expected).  But that has been taken into account when the numbers were crunched to come up with the $485.50 monthly income.  Siliken warranties that in year 1, we will get at least 97% of rated output, and in years 2-25, 0.7% per annum reduction.  In the attached proposal (see the Gallery page), you’ll notice that it was taken into account .5% reduction per annum over 20 years (which the installer says is probably a little more realistic.  If a solar manufacturer offers 0.7% per annum, you can expect that you will do better as they do not want to be replacing panels unless they absolutely have to).In fact, since the $485.50 per month calculated earnings were averaged over 20 years and the panels should earn more in the early years, we should earn more in the first 10 years - which means we could help even more people with more money than the calculations show!  Whoo hoo!


What if something breaks or the panels don't last that long or the roof needs replacing?The roof was reshingled last year, so we should be good for about 20 years.  There is a 10 year limited warranty on materials and workmanship for the Siliken 250W Solar panels, so we should be ok for the 10 years of the project.The Enphase micro-inverters (M215’s) are the latest design and come with a 25 year replacement warranty and free monitoring, meaning that for 25 years, we are completely covered.  If any of the micro-inverters were to go in 25 years, they actually would pay the installer to go out to our roof and replace them.  Plus, Eco Alternative Energy provides a full 2 year warranty on the installation (labour and parts).In addition, we will purchase insurance (about $100 per year that I will pay personally) to cover the cost of roof and panel replacement in case of an unforseen accident.So, we should be covered for the full 10 years of the project!  


What if you earn more money?  Or earn less than expected?All money earned from this project will go to the project.  We won't keep any of it.  We may earn more or less than expected, but all of it will go to helping people in need through micro-financing.  Hopefully, we will have some extra sunny days and be able to help even more people than we are expecting, and maybe even crack the half-million dollar mark! 


What is the environmental benefit?Annually, the solar energy will produce enough energy to power 371 houses for a day. (3710 over the 10 years)It will offset 17,133 pounds of carbon every year.  The equivalent of 196 trees.  (that is 171,330 pounds of carbon and 1,960 trees over the 10 years of the project).


How do the solar panels remove Carbon from our air?Ok, you caught me... they don’t actually “Remove” the carbon that is currently in our air, but by providing energy from solar panels we will replace the energy provided by those heavily polluting coal burning plants.  So we are really PREVENTING 1428 pounds of carbon from entering our air each month and not REMOVING existing carbon.  


Will I get to have a say in who and where the money is given?Yes and No.  We expect that the monthly re-investments in people will be a lot of work as the project grows and there is more and more money to loan to people every month.  We don't want to slow the process down by having to constantly consult with a world-wide committee every week.  However, we would welcome suggestions from anyone who donated to this project.  And, if we are unsure of whether or not to loan in a certain way (for example, through a new micro-financing route), we may choose to put out a survey to all of the supporters to this project and our direction will be dictated by where the majority of the survey votes want us to go. So yes, we will consider your suggestions, and you may get to vote on who, where and how we loan or donate our monies throughout the project.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>As you may know, we currently have two birds that are transmitting data to achieve two objectives: connect their phenotype and genotype to a breeding location and resolve the status of polymorphism in the subspecies <i>abieticola</i>. At this point we need to get many more transmitters out, because two birds is not enough to understand to what population these types belong. We also want to add more birds carrying transmitters as a strategy for obtaining breeding locations for population genomics work, while developing a growing dataset to answer questions including, but not limited to, the timing of movements, differential movements between and within populations, and to better understand plumage type as an indicator of geographic origin.</p>
<p>We need your help to do this! Our strategy is costly, because it requires a great deal of money and time on our part. Despite these costs, this strategy is the most efficient and effective method for achieving our research goals, because by approaching the sampling with transmitters we will avoid the challenge of international permitting, and the cost of travel to difficult areas to access such as the remote forests of boreal Canada. In other words, by tackling this research in this way, we will save both time and money!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>We plan to begin an ambitious effort for deploying transmitters starting this coming winter. Below is a detail of our plan, and how the money contributed by you will make this happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan to use the money from this campaign to purchase at least 10 tracking units to deploy this coming winter in the northeastern U.S., and the Great Plains. Even if COVID 19 limits this effort, we will be able to at least deploy units in New York and Kansas. </li>
<li>We will make the money you contribute go the farthest it can. To do this, we will target wintering subspecies that breed in regions that are logistically difficult and expensive to access, such as Boreal Canada and Alaska. These include <i>B. j. harlani</i>, <i>abieticola</i>, and a dark non-<i>harlani</i> (potentially <i>abieticola</i>) type that winters in the Great Plains, and on occasion parts of the east.</li>
<li>If we deploy these ten units this year, and obtain photographs and blood samples from each bird, we will have a solid start to the sampling for the evolutionary research, as well as for building an extensive dataset of full cycle movements for these enigmatic subspecies. </li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To get the sampling started to achieve all of our research objectives, we need to purchase transmitters. Below is a summary of how much these transmitters cost, and how the money you contribute will be applied.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost of transmitters -  One unit =  $790 ($500 per unit, plus $100 for insurance, $120 for yearly data fees, and $70 for shipping from the company in Europe). We would very much like to deploy at least ten of these units this winter, so we hope to raise as much as $10,000! </li>
<li>A contribution from you is not just generosity. There is a perk! You can choose to make a contribution of any amount here on this site, or you can choose support levels that include perks the following perks: $20 - Red-tailed Hawk Stickers; $30 - Dark Morph Red-tailed Hawk Tee; $60 - a limited archival giclee print of a Western Red-tailed Hawk plate, illustrated by Bryce W. Robinson; and for $100 you receive all three! To claim these perks, go to <a href=""https://ornithologi.bigcartel.com/category/the-red-tailed-hawk-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://ornithologi.bigcartel.com/category/the-...</a>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are creating a research program that will grow, enabling an increased understanding of this widespread and beloved species. But the data we gather from our effort will also go beyond understanding the Red-tailed Hawk alone. Here are a few examples of the impact we think our program will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the most fundamental level, our work will provide insight into Red-tailed Hawk subspecies that have been an enigma for so long. By attaching genetic samples to the breeding locations we obtain with the transmitters, we will be able to put genetic context to subspecies concepts, which might help us understand why harlani appears to be so different, and if subspecies such as abieticola truly are a distinct population.</li>
<li>Our work will also help us understand the evolutionary history of this species, which will be extremely informative for understanding the diversity we see in the species today, as well as providing yet another perspective on how geologic history can shape the development of species.</li>
<li>Connecting year round movement patterns to plumage and genetics will strengthen our ability to monitor Red-tailed Hawks, and enact conservation efforts if these are ever necessary. Even more, by doing so in Red-tailed Hawks, we can continue to refine this technique for use in other species. </li>
<li>We also hope that by crowdfunding for transmitters, we can involve the community in this research, and expand our collective understanding of this well known and beloved raptor. Through this, we also hope that anyone involved will gain a greater understanding and appreciation for how this type of research is conducted. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Transmitters can fail, birds can die for many reasons, natural and human caused. It is possible that some of the transmitters we deploy will not provide movement data, or a breeding location. But, we have a plan in case this happens!</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan to purchase insurance on the transmitters, so that in the event that a unit stops working for any reason, they will be replaced and we can try again. </li>
<li>If a bird dies, we can follow the signal of the unit to its location and assess the cause of death. Many studies use this technique to track hawks, and birds alike. Deaths from transmitters are extremely rare, so the likelihood of the transmitter harming a bird is very small. But birds still die from natural causes, or they get shot, hit by a car, or a wind turbine. We'll know if this happens, and we'll learn a lot if it does.</li>

<p>For the first couple years of production the main source of income will be the raw nut. This will help finance our future projects which is the extraction of walnut oil.

<h3><strong>Nutritional value </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Walnuts are thought to be unique among fruits and vegetable foods as they have strong antioxidant capacity.  Recent research has proved that walnuts have high nutritional value and can be part of a balanced diet, as long as the daily income does not exceed 30-60 g. It’s a food which is rich in fiber (2g./30g.), metals (magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, copper) and vitamins, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<h3><strong>How do we consume walnuts?</strong></h3>

<p>A walnut can be consumed with several ways, as raw, with no processing, roasted and salted. It can be used as well in cooking and pastry. Another use is in pharmaceutical industry and in production of walnut oil.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Health benefits</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Daily consumption of walnuts can reduce the chances of cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer, diabetes type 2 and various health problems. Recent studies showed that walnuts decrease the risk of a heart attack. Walnuts consist of rich source of natural substances with antioxidant capacity as melatonin, oleic acid, vitamin Ε, carotenoids and polyphenols. All the above components show protective action against cancer, aging, occurrence of inflammation and mental disorders.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Trees as a strong shield against climate change!</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>New studies showed that if we plant a trillion trees along the whole world, the amount of carbon dioxide on the atmosphere will decrease dramatically due to their ability to convert CO<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub>. This is the simplest, most enviromental and cost efficient solution, as scientists claim nowadays, for the confrontation of the climate change phenomenon.</p>
<p>The benefits from the cultivation of walnuts are many more. The growth of agricultural production contributes to the confrontation of the climate change, which is our main and biggest priority. In mountainous and semi-mountainous areas of Greece tree planting could be planned with walnut and chestnut cultivations, offering farmers an additional income, and at the same time raising the level of the atmosphere’s oxygen and decreasing also the air pollution. Moreover, the fact previous mentioned will contribute to the control of the environment’s temperature, avoiding as a result high temperatures. Pointing to that direction we commit in planting indigenous trees in the area of village Peristera, like walnut tree, so as to be created forests in areas that have been degraded soils or have been poor vegetation. </p>

</div></div></div>","Project location Peristera is a tiny village of around 25 residents and it is located in the northern part of rural Greece in Kozani province (https://goo.gl/maps/pt5UwqeoXWJadAQT9). Peristera is built on 712 meters and combined with the geographical relief of the area forms the appropriate conditions for walnut and chestnut cultivation. At the moment the main focus of locals is on cereal and medicinal or aromatic herb cultivation. Our vision The main goal is to create a walnut orchard on our privately owned land, where there is enough space for maximum 600 trees. The plan is to purchase 3 year old plants, while the production of nuts starts when the plant is 7 years old. Your contribution will help us finance our project for the first years when the revenue will be almost zero. With your help we will be able to buy the plants and implement improvements  on our land, which will enhance the productivity and decrease the chances of underachievement. Furthermore, Research and Development on production(quality, quantity) and on potential future markets is essential to go one step forward Here’s a break-down of what the funding will go toward: 

 
For the first couple years of production the main source of income will be the raw nut. This will help finance our future projects which is the extraction of walnut oil. This  is  used as aroma and flavor compound in cold dishes, while it is also used in beauty products. Last but not least, studies showed that herbal tea from the walnut tree leaves is beneficial for diabetics.
 
Nutritional value 
 
Walnuts are thought to be unique among fruits and vegetable foods as they have strong antioxidant capacity.  Recent research has proved that walnuts have high nutritional value and can be part of a balanced diet, as long as the daily income does not exceed 30-60 g. It’s a food which is rich in fiber (2g./30g.), metals (magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, copper) and vitamins, as shown in the chart below.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><span>Real Aware began life as a graduate level creative design course project at Carnegie Mellon University. The idea was to take a social issue and apply a thorough design methodology that would enable some form of active change. Currently the team is made up of Brad Roth and Bill Liu, ‘12 MHCI, but is looking to expand as the initiative gets underway.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Why and How</strong></h3>
<p class=""vspace"">Real Aware is important to us, as we have see the vast quantities of food wasted every day. We know that it is sometimes difficult for businesses to partake in recycling initiatives. We also know that there are a handful of businesses in our local area that do so despite the issues they face.</p>
<p class=""vspace"">We know that people want to support eco-conscious businesses, so we want to help these businesses. We hope that by making consumers more aware of the eco-friendly businesses around them, that these businesses will be rewarded with more support from their communities. This added support will hopefully make such a large impact that other businesses take notice and want the same benefits so they, too, sign up for recycling programs and adoption can grow organically.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p class=""vspace"">Besides your general support, we also need money. We cannot fund the initial phases of this project on our own. That is where you (hopefully) come in.</p>
<p class=""vspace"">For now, our plan is to design a prototype website that can act as a proof of concept for the Real Aware initiative. A $5 donation will get a personalized thank you email from Bill and myself. We believe $2000 is all we need in order to make this project a reality. A $15 donation will get you a personalized thank you as well as a custom desktop and smartphone background of our sticker design.

The first – is the problem of pollution of the planet. The second is your problem – bills for garbage collection. Users of CanMan sort their trash and drop it to the CanMan. Than we come to collect their waste from CanMan. We take the sorted waste and get out it from user’s houses. We don’t deliver waste to the landfill, we deliver it to the recycling plants. Recycling plants pay us for delivered sorted waste as for the raw materials for manufacture. And now thrown out users sorted garbage return back them money, less the operating expenses. Everyone wants to help solve the problem of the Earth pollution. One of the simplest way to help is to implement a waste sorting. Let’s save the planet by making waste sorting available for everyone.As we see our waste can be useful for us. It can save so much energy that we need! And why else waste sorting is so important?                                                                  Improving of CanMan:

<h3>Why this campaign and why now?</h3>
<p><strong>Why now? </strong></p>
<p>Bill just died on January 16th of this year.  I'm trying to save the land he protected and loved so much from being sold.</p>
<p><strong>Why the campaign?</strong></p>
<p><em>I truly believe, with all my heart, that we are all connected in same grand way and therefore what affects me, ultimately affects you too and vice versa.  </em></p>
<p>I'm trying to prevent the sale and eventual destruction of this magnificent northern forest; I'm hoping to help Bill's family pay off the remaining mortgage and save this amazing expanse of northern Ontario forested land for future generations to come.</p>
<p>CHECK OUT THE ""GOOGLE EARTH"" IMAGES OF THE PROPERTY, the assortment of pictures, along with a wonderful video of the Dean Lake Bridge area, done by videographer Dean Martin (also know as Simplyred4x4) - you'll find all of these under the ""gallery' tab.</p>
<h3>Why this is important to us -</h3>
<p><strong>First</strong> - Bill was passionate about preserving and protecting our national forests.  He believed that these natural, extraordinary and diverse ecosystems, besides being home to a myriad of wildlife species, trees, shrubs, flowers, plants and other unique vegetation, were also the 'lungs of the earth'. </p>
<p>Although his acreage was limited in size, his heart was huge.  He truly felt that he was contributing toward the fight for the global preservation of these magnificent bio-diverse centers (forests), which without a doubt, are a huge asset to our global environment.  We believe he was right .... if everyone did their part, think of the difference we could make.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong> - This scenic northern area is also where our family began.</p>
<p>William A. Somers Sr. (our father) was born in Copper Cliff, Ontario in 1929.  His father, Mansell Ellwood Somers (our grandfather - wife, Evelyn Somers - nee Paul) eventually became the Reeve of McKim Twp., Sudbury in the 1950s. </p>
<p>Dad, along with several of his brothers, joined the <strong>Canadian Armed Forces</strong> when they were just out of their teens - dad was 23. </p>
<p>After receiving an honorable discharge and retiring from the Army (1973)<strong>, </strong>which also meant his travelling days were over ... and after the sudden death of our mother (1999), dad moved back up North in 2008 and moved in with Bill, where he died in December 2009.</p>
<p>Bill Somers (Jr.) died there January 16th, 2013.</p>
<p>Please help us keep this legacy alive!</p>
<h2><strong>Bill’s Story</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve started this campaign in honor of my late brother, Bill Somers and on behalf of his two children, Jason Haverson and Mandy Somers (the recipients of this campaign).  Bill died just over a month ago now … he had just turned 59. </p>
<h3>Who Was Bill and What Was He Like?</h3>
<p>First and foremost, Bill was always helping someone else ... a friend, a loved one, a neighbour, a stranger.  And besides everything else, Bill was an artist – he played guitar and sang from the time he was in his early teens.  One of his all-time, favorite songs was, “He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother”.  The song says it all, but his life tells the incredible story of hardship, perseverance and triumph.  </p>
<h3>Bill’s Legacy – “He’s Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother”</h3>
<p>On January 16<sup>th</sup>, 2013 and approximately one month after his birthday, my brother was found dead in his home in Blind River (Dean Lake), the victim of a sudden and massive heart attack.  Bill lived alone on 172 acres of forested property in the Dean Lake area - a wildlife oasis - that above all odds he had managed to purchase, protect and hang onto for almost 18 years, despite his disabilities and the many hardships along the way.  This land was his life … and his love - breathtakingly beautiful, albeit rugged and untamed, just the way it should be.</p>
<p>We found a paper beside Bill when he died – this was the passage it contained:</p>
<p>“<em>Life can be as bitter as dragon tears.  But whether dragon tears are bitter or sweet, depends entirely on how each man perceives the taste.”</em></p>
<p>In order to tell you how this campaign came about, <em>I need to tell you the story behind it</em>, so please bear with me.  It’s a long story, but I promise you that it’s worth the read.</p>
<p>I lost my older brother Bill to a massive heart attack … Jason and Mandy lost their father … and as it stands right now, they’re also in jeopardy of losing everything he built and fought so hard to keep.  If these two young people don’t get the help they so desperately need … and soon, Bill’s ‘legacy of love’ ends with him. </p>
<p>18 years ago, after a heart-breaking divorce … and after living in southern Ontario for almost twenty years, Bill decided to move north and begin his life again.  Bill’s troubles had been many but over the years since his move North, he had faced them head-on … he overcame each one, conquered his fears and demons (which included alcohol addiction) and then finally, lived a life of gratitude and thankfulness.  He developed an appreciation for all of life and a wisdom that was far beyond his years.  He had a kind heart and an old soul.</p>
<p>Because of a horrific family situation and a life of abuse, Bill had been on his own since he was 16 years old.  After running away from home, he had initially lived on the street, but then shortly thereafter, had been welcomed into his best friend’s family home.  He also lost that dear friend, Glen, in a drowning accident when he was 18.  Bill was always a survivor, but the cruel twists that life dealt him, had also taken their toll. </p>
<p>In the mid 1990s, he bought 172 acres of northern forest land near Dean Lake, where he lived in a small, but cozy cottage-style home (built on top of a massive rock formation), until his sudden death last month.  He was taken much too early.</p>
<p>Bill loved <em>his</em> property.  He had a true respect for the land and all that it gave him.  He lived a minimalist existence.  He <em>loved </em>the deer, the wolves, the moose, the sand pipers and even the bear he encountered each spring when they surfaced with their new off-spring.  He planted (and shared) a huge vegetable garden and harvested the beautiful northern blueberries found throughout his property – in fact he made the best blueberry scones around, but was constantly trying to beat the resident bear to the various patches!  He learned to live in harmony with nature and the wildlife around him … each taking what they needed from the land and each giving back what was essential to sustain their surroundings … while also showing a healthy respect for each other’s needs and space.</p>
<p>However, the most amazing part of this story is the fact that Bill held onto this land through thick and thin … and he did it, while living on a disability of approx. <em>$1,100.00</em> per month, faithfully paying his mortgage each and every month.  Besides having painful and debilitating rheumatoid arthritis, along with a heart condition and a blood clotting disorder (that required $120 compression stocking), Bill was also buried in a landslide at the Sand Hills Provincial Park years ago, while vacationing with his young family – an accident that put him in the ICU for weeks and left his lungs forever severely compromised because of the sand.</p>
<p>But <em>this same man</em> made almost daily treks to the bush with his Great Pyrenees 'Brat', who was his constant companion and was always at his side.  Although Bill would never consider logging his property or even cutting down a single living tree, he was forever removing and clearing tangled brush and <em>dead</em> trees, in order to keep the landscape healthy and prevent smaller wildlife from being injured and/or trapped.  He also used the weak, fallen and dead trees as firewood to heat his home.  If his old tractor or truck didn’t run, which was often the case, he would pull the logs home by hand using a ‘huge’ snow scoop … and use the hills and the packed trails as momentum. </p>
<p>Bill was usually on foot and in the winter months, he used snow shoes and skis to traverse the trails and landscapes.  Huge storms could mean that he was basically ‘snowed-in’ for weeks at a time, so he was always prepared.  There was nothing he loved more than a day out in the bush.   He meticulously mapped his property by marking the trees and various trails with inconspicuous, different colored rope and/or tape. </p>
<p>Bill had always dreamed about owning land up north and once he followed his vision, everything else in his life seemed to gradually fall into its proper place.  He was happy; he was at peace.  He loved and respected his natural surroundings … it was all he ever talked about.  He made sure that he managed his property in such a way, that it would remain in pristine shape; true to its origin and its natural state.  It would be his legacy to his two children once he was gone.  </p>
<p>I can’t even begin to tell you how proud I was of him and all that he accomplished during his short lifetime.  He was an honest and loyal man; a man of integrity and sacrifice.  If nothing else, this is a story of determination and survival; the story of a man, who despite all odds, managed to overcome and survive his own fears, disabilities, short-comings and demons.  His resilience and perseverance was inspiring, if not downright courageous.  The spirit is a wonderful thing … and Bill’s was indomitable!</p>
<p>Bill was a proud man; a man who worked tirelessly to keep his land from being mercilessly logged or abused.  After he died, we heard so many beautiful stories of his selflessness from neighbors and friends.  Although he spent much of his time alone and for the most part remained isolated, he would always show up whenever there was someone in need. </p>
<p>One such story immediately comes to mind – the story of a man who had been injured in the mines and was unable to cut and pile his firewood for winter, because of excruciating back pain.  Bill had heard about them on his weekly trip to town and although he had never met the couple, he showed up in their driveway that very same day with his chain-saw and axe in tow.  His first comment after introducing himself, was … “let’s get this done” … and within a couple of days, he had not only cut and piled every stick of dead wood they owned, but went on to reinforce and repair their deck, railings and balcony.  The only thing he would take in return was a free home-cooked meal … and from that day on, they became the best of friends.  Bill was always best at ‘bartering’ for his needs. </p>
<p>This couple remained close friends with Bill until the day he died … and after staying with them while dealing with his untimely passing, we understood exactly what community spirit was all about.  During our three days in Dean Lake, they recounted many similar instances of kindness, where Bill had helped members of their small community without ever asking for anything in return.  In fact, he would think nothing of spending his last dollar to help someone else … and often did. </p>
<p>If there weren’t enough provisions in the house, he would still make sure that his faithful dog Brat had food, even if it meant that he went without.  He could survive for months with veggies from his garden (in his freezer), rice, flour, blueberries etc.  He made his own bread and did all his own cooking, despite the fact that regular money for groceries was usually non-existent.  He did this for eighteen years!</p>
<p>This was the area he loved; an area he was so proud to call home.  Bill paid his mortgage faithfully but according to his bank, was not eligible for life insurance (he applied and was turned down).  When he died, there was still approximately $40,000.00 owing on the mortgage, not to mention the funeral and burial expenses.  It’s devastating! </p>
<p>I’d like to create the opportunity for his children to hang on to his house and his property. Unfortunately, as it stands now, neither of them has the resources to take on this huge debt … and I myself, am in no position to help with finances.</p>
<p>Toward the end of his life, he worried constantly about finances and how he would survive … but his biggest worry was how to keep his property and his legacy alive … it was something that he felt so passionate about – a ‘legacy of love’ that could be passed on to his two children and then perhaps someday, on to his grandchildren.  His final wishes were to have his ashes spread throughout his beautiful property at DeanLake. </p>
<p>Every now and again a story comes along that defies all logic and tears away at your heartstrings, until you can’t help but wonder where the justice is in any of this.</p>
<p>Stories of loss, of abuse, of heartache and injustice are everywhere, but incidents of triumph should surely share the spotlight.  My brother … my friend … deserves that much.</p>
<p>His family deserves that much.</p>
<p>I’m hoping that this story is one of those – a story of hope and then finally … a story of triumph.</p>

<p><strong>All the work on the center is 100% voluntary!</strong> We build it together: women, men, youth, children, elderly people - everyone is always made welcome in this space.  </p>
<p>The center's aims are: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>To promote sustainable education and Permaculture in our region</strong> - (workshops in mud-building, bio-intensive agriculture, community building; Eco-activities for children, youth and adults, and more...)</li>
<li>To serve as an <strong>open home for the local community</strong> - free exchange markets take place here once a month, ""green"" events, community gardening, local ""time bank"", etc </li>
<li>
<strong>To promote alternative education for children:</strong> the centre will be used by our local homeschooling community, as a place where our children can grow up together with us as a community. Instead of going to a regular school, they will learn from life itself the skills they will need for a better future for humankind. </li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need - </strong></h2>
<p>Up until now, we managed to build the walls of the ecocenter with virtually no funding at all and LOTS of volunteer work. The funds came from fundraising markets and workshops that we initiated. </p>
<p>Now, we have come across bigger expenses, broken down as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>$7894 - replacing the old roof with a new one </li>
<li>$2606 - replacing the old windows and fitting in a very large door at one of the openings.  </li>
<li>There are many other expenses of course, but if we get these two bigger expenses funded, we will be able to use the Center itself as a place by which to raise further funds. </li>
</ul><p>If we don't reach the full goal, we will first fund the windows, and then hope to raise more funds for replacing the roof.  </p>
<h2><strong>What You Get - </strong></h2>
<p>Some of the things we offer in return to your support are available if you live in Israel: discounts for workshops, community events, and other services we offer. </p>
<p>However, if you live outside of Israel, you can still enjoy being mentioned on our website, or even having your name engraved on one of the Center's earth walls or earth floor!</p>
<p>For larger-sum donators, we can send an electronic version of our <strong>booklet ""Sustainable Community Building - from single family units to cooperation""</strong> - a manual that includes articles about community building, sustainable education, how to initiate and maintain an exchange market, and more. </p>
<p><strong>We wish to inspire other communities around the world!</strong> Larger-sum donators will also get a free Skype call with one of our community leaders who will be happy to answer any of your questions and help your community dream become a reality! </p>
<p><strong>Planning a trip to Israel?</strong> We can organize <strong>a free tour</strong> of the Center for you and your friends plus <strong>a half-day workshop</strong> on a topic of your choice: mud-building, permaculture, community building and more... We will be happy to host you here! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why is this so important? </strong></h2>
<p>We are living in an exciting and challenging era. </p>
<p>The world is changing: economic, social and environmental crises are taking place and the challenges are likely to increase as time goes by. </p>
<p><strong>Centers like ours are the future!</strong> We are building a social, economic and environmental alternative through which we can pass on the knowledge and ancient wisdom of connection between ourselves and the natural world. In this manner, we will be able to cope together with the challenges, and perhaps even form a network of communities helping each other out.</p>
<p>Our Center promotes not only a ""greener"" tomorrow, but also aims to promote better communication between people by fostering the values of cooperation, honesty, modesty, listening, empathy and caring. </p>

<h3>10 BACKCOUNTRY LEAN-TO SHELTERS</h3>
<h3>Plus 10 Composting Latrines</h3>
<h3>On 165 Miles of Wilderness Hiking</h3>
<p>We're an <strong>all-volunteer</strong> nonprofit organization--The Cohos Trail Association-- building shelters on the long-distance Cohos Trail that we planned and built over the last decade, the longest new hiking trail system created in the eastern United States in decades. We've constructed three lean-to shelters so far, plus their accompanying aerobic composting latrines and sign kiosks. But we want to triple our efforts.</p>

Plus 10 Composting Latrines
On 165 Miles of Wilderness Hiking
We're an all-volunteer nonprofit organization--The Cohos Trail Association-- building shelters on the long-distance Cohos Trail that we planned and built over the last decade, the longest new hiking trail system created in the eastern United States in decades. We've constructed three lean-to shelters so far, plus their accompanying aerobic composting latrines and sign kiosks. But we want to triple our efforts.
WHAT WE'LL DO AND WHERE
There are seven more shelters and their composting latrines planned in rugged mountainous terrain stretching from the White Mountain National Forest of New Hampshire (the Northeast's tallest peaks) all the way to the Canadian border, where the trail links with the 70-mile Sentiers Frontaliers hiking trail system in Quebec, Canada, to create the second international trail system on the continent.

HOW WE'LL DO IT
Your gift will support the purchase of water-power sawmill-sawn locally grown lumber, metal roofing, cement, fasteners, and stains. Your dollars will provide funds for transporting materials and will underwrite food and supplies for all the volunteers who come out to build the shelter on-site in backcountry locations. And your funds will help bring much needed economic activity to one of the more economically depressed regions of the Northeast.

<h3>Green Elephant Recycling</h3>
<p>Green Elephant Recycling allows you the convenience of curbside recycling pick up and the opportunity to recycle more than what our city recycling center currently accepts. Here is what we will be accepting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shredded paper, newspaper, and junk mail</li>
<li>Cardboard (broken down)</li>
<li>#1-#7 plastic containers (rinsed with no lids or caps)</li>
<li>Green, brown, and clear glass containers (rinsed with no lids or caps)</li>
<li>Steel and aluminum cans (rinsed with no lids or caps)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>To be able to offer the convenience of curbside pick up and allow a wider range of materials to be recycled, we will need to make sure there is enough interest to cover expenses (cost of fuel) and make this business profitable. So here is what we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>20 people to pledge 3 months worth of pick up ($90)</li>
<li>You to share this with all your friends and family to meet this goal!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Most of us understand that recycling is being a good steward of the land we have been given, but this also helps our city. This will reduce the amount of trash that our city has to pick up and pay to dump. So not only are you helping the planet, but you are also helping by making an economic investment into our city.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We want to be open and honest about this new adventure. It will not be easy. Here are some things that we will not know until we jump right in and do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Competing trash days with recycling pick up days as we grow. We will be starting out on Saturdays to help curb this problem, but as we grow we might have to add days.</li>
<li>Figuring fuel cost for pick ups. Strategically routing pick ups and people joining from different parts of town at first is difficult to calculate.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Green Elephant Recycling
Green Elephant Recycling allows you the convenience of curbside recycling pick up and the opportunity to recycle more than what our city recycling center currently accepts. Here is what we will be accepting:

Shredded paper, newspaper, and junk mail
Cardboard (broken down)
#1-#7 plastic containers (rinsed with no lids or caps)
Green, brown, and clear glass containers (rinsed with no lids or caps)
Steel and aluminum cans (rinsed with no lids or caps)


What We Need 
To be able to offer the convenience of curbside pick up and allow a wider range of materials to be recycled, we will need to make sure there is enough interest to cover expenses (cost of fuel) and make this business profitable. So here is what we need:

20 people to pledge 3 months worth of pick up ($90)
You to share this with all your friends and family to meet this goal!


The Impact
Most of us understand that recycling is being a good steward of the land we have been given, but this also helps our city. This will reduce the amount of trash that our city has to pick up and pay to dump. So not only are you helping the planet, but you are also helping by making an economic investment into our city.

Risks & Challenges
We want to be open and honest about this new adventure. It will not be easy. Here are some things that we will not know until we jump right in and do it:

Competing trash days with recycling pick up days as we grow. We will be starting out on Saturdays to help curb this problem, but as we grow we might have to add days.
Figuring fuel cost for pick ups. Strategically routing pick ups and people joining from different parts of town at first is difficult to calculate.

Intellectual Property</p><p>Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology as well as our intellectual property. To succeed here, we rely on a combination of patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights. This allows us to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. So far we have over 200 pending claims. These intellectual property claims cover different aspects of our technology, and many of them have been or will be filed both in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications related to our technology platform with a strong emphasis on protecting our core technologies. As is the situation with all patent application filing, we do not know whether our pending patent applications will materialize into issuance of patents or whether the examination process will necessitate us to narrow our claims. Despite the fact that there can be no guarantee that these pending patent applications, if granted, will provide us with complete protection, our management of these filings is highly focused on maximizing the possibility of securing the strongest patent protection available.</p><p>Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our patented technology platform and related intellectual property. Third parties could infringe or misappropriate our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and a wide range of other proprietary rights. Litigation may be needed to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and range of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation or other possible claims. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Moreover, any type of settlement of or negative judgment resulting from such litigation could restrict or prohibit our use other technology. Our inadequacy or inability to properly protect our intellectual property or to defend against third-part infringement claims could potentially harm our business.</p><p>If external party patents or other intellectual property rights cover any of our processes, products or derived technologies, we could be subject to various legal actions. As a result of this reality that all biotechnology and technology companies face, we can assure you that our technology and products do not infringe patents held by others or that will not in the future. The bottom line is that litigation is costly and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be high in the future or that we will be victorious in any such litigation.</p><p>2. Regulatory Approvals</p><p>There are many approvals required for a number of our applications and due to this our technology platform may be delayed. Government approvals are required and we are in the process of working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, to ensure that we receive the proper approvals for our biofuel technology. Additionally, we are in the process of securing approvals globally and within all of our industries working with analogous agencies such as the FDA for food.</p><p>3. Research and Development</p><p>Our research and development team is highly motivated and primarily focused on the continued advancement of our technology platform to maximize the value within all of our industries. We believe that we will continue to improve and develop our platform. In order to ensure this we will devote significant expenditures to research and development. Without proper research and development with well-invested resources allocated to our efforts we will not be able to succeed.</p><p>4. Competition</p><p>In the short-term, we expect that we will have several potential competitors in several of our industries: established enterprises and new companies that seek to produce renewable fuels or renewable energy. In the long-term, we believe that our Biofuel will compete with petroleum-based fuels within the transportation fuels market. <br/>We believe that the primary competitive factors in the renewable energy market are: <br/>o	The scope of qualification <br/>o	Compatibility with existing infrastructure <br/>o	Product performance and quality <br/>o	Product price <br/>o	Ability to produce commercial volume <br/>o	Reliability <br/>We believe that the primary factors in the global market are: <br/>o	Product performance and quality <br/>o	Overall Price <br/>o	Commercialization <br/>o	Reliability <br/>Given the size of our overall market and even the individual markets such as the traditional transportation fuels market we do not believe that the success of other renewable products will prevent us from being successful. However, we must be mindful that it is important for us to reach potential customers and convince them that our technology platform and derived technologies and products are effective and the best choice based on qualification, compatibility, price, commercialization, and reliability. The positive nature of our business is that we intend to license our technology to essentially all of our competitors. This means that our competitors are also our customers. This way we eliminate risk and greatly mitigate the challenge of facing well-establish enterprises and companies.</p><p>5. Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters</p><p>Our operations are indirectly and directly affected by a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that could either benefit or hurt us depending on the clauses. Considering that we are entirely green, eco-friendly, and sustainable we expect that these laws will essentially become a strong asset to our technology and company. We have been positively supported by a wide range of laws and acts, such as the CAA, CERCLA, Clean Water Act, RCRA, and the Toxic Substances Control Act. We anticipate that laws and acts will continue to pass that favor technologies and companies that are similar to us.</p><p>6. Seasonality</p><p>We do not expect that the demand for our technology platform, derived technologies, or products from our technology will be subject to seasonality. However, prices for certain supplies that we may use for our technology and business can be subject to seasonal changes.</p><p>7. Employees</p><p>All of our employees are located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never had any experience of employment-related stoppages, and we strongly believe that our employee relationships will continue to be very good.</p><p>Risks Related to Our Business and Industries</p><p>1. We are a development stage company. We have not generated any significant revenue and our business will not accomplish its goals if we are not able to commercialize successfully on our technology platform within at least one of our primary industries.</p><p>We are subject to the typical risk of failure facing any business that is seeking to develop new products or technologies. Certain factors that could, alone or in combination, prevent us from achieving commercialization within one or all of our industries include: <br/>•	Technical challenges developing our commercial production at late stage that was unable to overcome <br/>•	Ability to finance our complete plan with standard production of our headquarters, laboratory, and facilities. <br/>•	Ability to achieve large scale production on a cost-effective basis and in the time frame that we set out <br/>•	Ability to secure and maintain loyal customers that will purchase our technology platform and related technologies in licensing agreements <br/>•	Ability to produce our technology platform to customer specifications in a related industry <br/>•	Ability to secure access to sufficient material resources and supplies that are economically priced for our business <br/>•	Changes in government regulations and policies affecting one of our industries <br/>•	Ability to secure and maintain all required regulatory approvals <br/>•	Actions by indirect or direct competitors that may seek to impose barriers to one or more of our industries</p><p>2. We need substantial capital in order to meet our operating and other costs.</p><p>As with any business, we require a set amount or fixed cost in order to successfully operate. Fortunately, we require much less than the typical biotechnology company. However, our costs are still substantial due to the necessary research and development that will be required within each of our industries. We will need to hire top-level personnel and will require a state-of-the-art lab in order to function properly.</p><p>3. In the early stage of our business we will be vulnerable to disruptions to our operations as is any business that functions solely in a single first-of-kind facility.</p><p>In order to achieve steady-state operations at our facility, it will be required to perform periodic maintenance and turnarounds. We will try limiting the portion of the facility that may be disrupted during this maintenance however we cannot predict how much maintenance will be needed or the type of disruption that will result. Any significant disruption can affect the facilities operations however it should not affect revenues and cash flows greatly since we are a licensing based company.</p><p>Operations may also be interrupted by electricity, natural gas, water treatment or other utilities. Other potentially disruptive events include natural disasters, inclement weather, workplace or environmental accidents, mechanical failure, fires, explosions, supply interruptions, work stoppage, losses of permits or authorization or acts of terrorism. Some of these events have the potential to cause loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of private or personal property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in the cessation of operations and the problems of civil or criminal penalties. These are all standard concerns for any business and we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur losses related to these or other events beyond the limits or exceeding the scope of coverage from our insurance policies.</p><p>4. We have no experience producing “Direct-Light” Technology at the scale needed for the development of our business to commercial scale.</p><p>We must display our ability to apply our proprietary technology platform and process design at a large enough scale to secure commercialization.</p><p>5. The actual cost of constructing, operating and maintaining the facility or facilities necessary to produce our “Direct-Light” Technology platform in each of our industries at commercial volume may be significantly higher than we plan or anticipate.</p><p>If and when our facility or facilities are constructed, our costs for operations and maintenance may be significantly higher than we predicted. Additionally, our facilities may not operate as efficiently as we expect. As a result, our initial facility for commercial production of our “Direct-Light” Technology platform may not be able to achieve expectation and there will not be able achieve our expected investment return, which could negatively affect our business and results. Fortunately, we have a large number of industries that we work within so our risk is lessened.</p><p>6. We face challenges in obtaining market acceptance of our “Direct-Light” Technology or we cannot secure the proper customer base.</p><p>We intend to market our “Direct-Light” Technology platform to select companies in all of our top industries. We assume that these companies will desire our services based on one single fact: we reduce production costs. This means that these companies will increase profits working with us. This is completely logical however sometimes unpredictable behavior or conditions can arise in the marketplace and we cannot guarantee that expected business practice based on simple margins will naturally occur in all cases.</p><p>7. We have limited experience with structuring arrangement with prospective customers for licensing agreements with our “Direct-Light” Technology Platform.</p><p>In order for us to license our technology to our potential customers we must negotiate contracts and form business relationships. The companies with which we expect to have customer arrangements with are generally much larger than us and have substantially greater bargaining power than us considering their resources. We do believe that his will not arise as an issue for us because we help these companies improve globally. Additionally, we have secured a strong advising team that is well placed within several of our key companies. Some of our advisors to name a few are former CEOs of top Fortune 500 companies within energy companies that are our prime customers.</p><p>8. Growth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure.</p><p>We may experience large growth within our company and markets. If this occurs we will be required to expand. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency within our organization as it expands, our business could be harmed.</p><p>9. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to achieve or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors.</p><p>Key factors for this will be: <br/>•	Timing of milestones <br/>•	Profitability <br/>•	Feasibility <br/>•	Management <br/>•	Fluctuations in prices within our industries <br/>•	Availability <br/>•	Government programs, incentives, and regulations <br/>•	Reporting <br/>•	Dependence on key management and personnel <br/>•	Ability to obtain, protect and enforce intellectual property rights <br/>•	Advantages of working with us <br/>•	Ability to obtain additional capital if needed <br/>•	Business interruptions <br/>•	Compliance <br/>•	Handling of materials</p><br/><p></p>

""Direct-Light"" Technology can produce renewable and sustainable commercially viable biofuel, hydrogen fuel, electric power, better vehicles, and the list goes on.http://ns.gmnews.com/news/2011-08-25/Front_Page/Twins_go_from_GEDs_to_Columbia_University.htmlhttp://www.linkedin.com/pub/eugene-dinescu/88/9b/600http://columbia.academia.edu/VincentDinescuhttp://www.linkedin.com/pub/vincent-dinescu/43/952/755http://www.quovadisnewspaper.com/twins-enroll-at-columbia-university-with-a-boost-from-mcc-1.2616527Who we areWe are twin brothers and have been working together for most of our lives. Delineating our roles and responsibilities came naturally. It just seemed wisest and most logical to separate roles and responsibilities based on our strengths and interests. Eugene possesses a strong ability to lead and is more focused on overall company vision while Vincent is also a leader but enjoys a more hands on strategy in order to run day-to-day operations and management. We are both specialists in the science.Most impressive accomplishmentOur mother was diagnosed with cancer, we did not have any health insurance at the time, and we were losing our home. Vincent and I decided to drop out of H.S. so that we can work and take care of everything. We succeeded, our mother has been in remission since 2007, we saved the house, got GEDs, were featured in the news, and got accepted to Columbia University. Acquired enough credits to graduate with honors in 3 years but decided to continue to take more advanced science courses and research.ProductDirect-Light” Technology is the world’s 1st renewable energy platform that delivers an immediate solution for increasing profit margins, sustainability, and commercial viability for manufacturers of biofuel (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generations including biopropane), food (animal and animal based food products), hydrogen fuel, feed, and fertilizer. Our patented “Direct-Light” Technology can also be implemented in a long list of additional industries including crop, electrical power, and computer. Unlike the current biotechnology companies, ”Direct-Light” Technology provides a green solution that can effectively replace all of the current primary technology platforms. Additionally, we have developed our patented “Green Technology Cycle”. This cycle replaces nonrenewable modes of energy production and also drastically outcompetes them for a fraction of the cost while also minimizing any waste. Our customers include manufacturers of biofuel, food, hydrogen fuel, feed, fertilizer, etc.TechnologyInvented & patented ""Direct-Light"" Technology and the ""Green Technology Cycle"". ""Direct-Light"" Technology utilizes a unique cellular machine. This machine can be trangenically added into any organism to produce commercially viable biofuel, photosynthetic animals (food), and supercharged crops. Additionally, this machine can be coupled to any electrical or mechanical device to produce energy via our primary action mechanism. With ""Direct-Light"" Technology we can produce a renewable electrical generator that can power entire cities with minimal cost. ""Direct-Light"" Technology possesses an enormous potential with an ever-increasing list of applications. It leaves every scientist awestruck and several of Columbia's top researchers believe that it will be the key energy platform of the future. What truly sets us apart from all other biotechnology and energy companies is the fact that our energy platform is the world's 1st multi-industry disruptive innovation.Customers""Direct-Light"" Technology drastically reduces costs (more profit) in all of the following: Biofuel Manufacturers: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Gen. & Biopropane.

Hovercraft-Station20. Commercial-Plane21. Ultra-JetRisks and challengesWorld Biotechnology Risks & Challenges1. Intellectual PropertyOur success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary technology as well as our intellectual property. To succeed here, we rely on a combination of patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights. This allows us to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. So far we have over 200 pending claims. These intellectual property claims cover different aspects of our technology, and many of them have been or will be filed both in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications related to our technology platform with a strong emphasis on protecting our core technologies. As is the situation with all patent application filing, we do not know whether our pending patent applications will materialize into issuance of patents or whether the examination process will necessitate us to narrow our claims. Despite the fact that there can be no guarantee that these pending patent applications, if granted, will provide us with complete protection, our management of these filings is highly focused on maximizing the possibility of securing the strongest patent protection available.Our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our patented technology platform and related intellectual property. Third parties could infringe or misappropriate our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and a wide range of other proprietary rights. Litigation may be needed to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and range of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation or other possible claims. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. Moreover, any type of settlement of or negative judgment resulting from such litigation could restrict or prohibit our use other technology. Our inadequacy or inability to properly protect our intellectual property or to defend against third-part infringement claims could potentially harm our business.If external party patents or other intellectual property rights cover any of our processes, products or derived technologies, we could be subject to various legal actions. As a result of this reality that all biotechnology and technology companies face, we can assure you that our technology and products do not infringe patents held by others or that will not in the future. The bottom line is that litigation is costly and time consuming, and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be high in the future or that we will be victorious in any such litigation.2. Regulatory ApprovalsThere are many approvals required for a number of our applications and due to this our technology platform may be delayed. Government approvals are required and we are in the process of working with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or the EPA, to ensure that we receive the proper approvals for our biofuel technology. Additionally, we are in the process of securing approvals globally and within all of our industries working with analogous agencies such as the FDA for food.3. Research and DevelopmentOur research and development team is highly motivated and primarily focused on the continued advancement of our technology platform to maximize the value within all of our industries. We believe that we will continue to improve and develop our platform. In order to ensure this we will devote significant expenditures to research and development. Without proper research and development with well-invested resources allocated to our efforts we will not be able to succeed.4. CompetitionIn the short-term, we expect that we will have several potential competitors in several of our industries: established enterprises and new companies that seek to produce renewable fuels or renewable energy. In the long-term, we believe that our Biofuel will compete with petroleum-based fuels within the transportation fuels market. We believe that the primary competitive factors in the renewable energy market are: o	The scope of qualification o	Compatibility with existing infrastructure o	Product performance and quality o	Product price o	Ability to produce commercial volume o	Reliability We believe that the primary factors in the global market are: o	Product performance and quality o	Overall Price o	Commercialization o	Reliability Given the size of our overall market and even the individual markets such as the traditional transportation fuels market we do not believe that the success of other renewable products will prevent us from being successful. However, we must be mindful that it is important for us to reach potential customers and convince them that our technology platform and derived technologies and products are effective and the best choice based on qualification, compatibility, price, commercialization, and reliability. The positive nature of our business is that we intend to license our technology to essentially all of our competitors. This means that our competitors are also our customers. This way we eliminate risk and greatly mitigate the challenge of facing well-establish enterprises and companies.5. Environmental and Other Regulatory MattersOur operations are indirectly and directly affected by a variety of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that could either benefit or hurt us depending on the clauses. Considering that we are entirely green, eco-friendly, and sustainable we expect that these laws will essentially become a strong asset to our technology and company. We have been positively supported by a wide range of laws and acts, such as the CAA, CERCLA, Clean Water Act, RCRA, and the Toxic Substances Control Act. We anticipate that laws and acts will continue to pass that favor technologies and companies that are similar to us.6. SeasonalityWe do not expect that the demand for our technology platform, derived technologies, or products from our technology will be subject to seasonality. However, prices for certain supplies that we may use for our technology and business can be subject to seasonal changes.7. EmployeesAll of our employees are located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never had any experience of employment-related stoppages, and we strongly believe that our employee relationships will continue to be very good.Risks Related to Our Business and Industries1. We are a development stage company. We have not generated any significant revenue and our business will not accomplish its goals if we are not able to commercialize successfully on our technology platform within at least one of our primary industries.We are subject to the typical risk of failure facing any business that is seeking to develop new products or technologies. Certain factors that could, alone or in combination, prevent us from achieving commercialization within one or all of our industries include: •	Technical challenges developing our commercial production at late stage that was unable to overcome •	Ability to finance our complete plan with standard production of our headquarters, laboratory, and facilities. •	Ability to achieve large scale production on a cost-effective basis and in the time frame that we set out •	Ability to secure and maintain loyal customers that will purchase our technology platform and related technologies in licensing agreements •	Ability to produce our technology platform to customer specifications in a related industry •	Ability to secure access to sufficient material resources and supplies that are economically priced for our business •	Changes in government regulations and policies affecting one of our industries •	Ability to secure and maintain all required regulatory approvals •	Actions by indirect or direct competitors that may seek to impose barriers to one or more of our industries2. We need substantial capital in order to meet our operating and other costs.As with any business, we require a set amount or fixed cost in order to successfully operate. Fortunately, we require much less than the typical biotechnology company. However, our costs are still substantial due to the necessary research and development that will be required within each of our industries. We will need to hire top-level personnel and will require a state-of-the-art lab in order to function properly.3. In the early stage of our business we will be vulnerable to disruptions to our operations as is any business that functions solely in a single first-of-kind facility.In order to achieve steady-state operations at our facility, it will be required to perform periodic maintenance and turnarounds. We will try limiting the portion of the facility that may be disrupted during this maintenance however we cannot predict how much maintenance will be needed or the type of disruption that will result. Any significant disruption can affect the facilities operations however it should not affect revenues and cash flows greatly since we are a licensing based company.Operations may also be interrupted by electricity, natural gas, water treatment or other utilities. Other potentially disruptive events include natural disasters, inclement weather, workplace or environmental accidents, mechanical failure, fires, explosions, supply interruptions, work stoppage, losses of permits or authorization or acts of terrorism. Some of these events have the potential to cause loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of private or personal property and equipment and environmental damage, and may result in the cessation of operations and the problems of civil or criminal penalties. These are all standard concerns for any business and we cannot provide any assurance that we will not incur losses related to these or other events beyond the limits or exceeding the scope of coverage from our insurance policies.4. We have no experience producing “Direct-Light” Technology at the scale needed for the development of our business to commercial scale.We must display our ability to apply our proprietary technology platform and process design at a large enough scale to secure commercialization.5. The actual cost of constructing, operating and maintaining the facility or facilities necessary to produce our “Direct-Light” Technology platform in each of our industries at commercial volume may be significantly higher than we plan or anticipate.If and when our facility or facilities are constructed, our costs for operations and maintenance may be significantly higher than we predicted. Additionally, our facilities may not operate as efficiently as we expect. As a result, our initial facility for commercial production of our “Direct-Light” Technology platform may not be able to achieve expectation and there will not be able achieve our expected investment return, which could negatively affect our business and results. Fortunately, we have a large number of industries that we work within so our risk is lessened.6. We face challenges in obtaining market acceptance of our “Direct-Light” Technology or we cannot secure the proper customer base.We intend to market our “Direct-Light” Technology platform to select companies in all of our top industries. We assume that these companies will desire our services based on one single fact: we reduce production costs. This means that these companies will increase profits working with us. This is completely logical however sometimes unpredictable behavior or conditions can arise in the marketplace and we cannot guarantee that expected business practice based on simple margins will naturally occur in all cases.7. We have limited experience with structuring arrangement with prospective customers for licensing agreements with our “Direct-Light” Technology Platform.In order for us to license our technology to our potential customers we must negotiate contracts and form business relationships. The companies with which we expect to have customer arrangements with are generally much larger than us and have substantially greater bargaining power than us considering their resources. We do believe that his will not arise as an issue for us because we help these companies improve globally. Additionally, we have secured a strong advising team that is well placed within several of our key companies. Some of our advisors to name a few are former CEOs of top Fortune 500 companies within energy companies that are our prime customers.8. Growth may place significant demands on our management and our infrastructure.We may experience large growth within our company and markets. If this occurs we will be required to expand. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency within our organization as it expands, our business could be harmed.9. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future. As a result, we may fail to achieve or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors.Key factors for this will be: •	Timing of milestones •	Profitability •	Feasibility •	Management •	Fluctuations in prices within our industries •	Availability •	Government programs, incentives, and regulations •	Reporting •	Dependence on key management and personnel •	Ability to obtain, protect and enforce intellectual property rights •	Advantages of working with us •	Ability to obtain additional capital if needed •	Business interruptions •	Compliance •	Handling of materials",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Save Durable Dish</h3>
<p>We provide reusable, durable dishes to ready-to-eat food vendors at our market.  This prevents 90 gallons of disposable, single use utensils and dishes from entering the waste stream every market.  This is made possible through a generous community partnership with Thatcher's, who allows us access to their commercial kitchen's dishwashing facilities.</p>
<p>Durable Dish is in jeopardy.  The volunteer supply has been thin at best since the program launched in 2009 and in 2012 it dwindled. The program has been made feasible by individuals who have shouldered a heavy burden season by season, requiring unsustainable levels of effort.  The choice between burning out scarce volunteers and providing inconsistent durable dish service is not a viable one.</p>
<p><strong>To keep Durable Dish alive in 2013, we need to fund two staff positions to staff the dish return station and wash dishes during the after market on Sundays.</strong>  This will make the experience of durable dish reliable and consistent for vendors and customers.  </p>
<p>In 2010, Durable Dish won the Association of Oregon Recyclers' Alice Soderwall Reuse and Waste Prevention Award.  It has also received national attention (<a href=""http://meredithsorensen.blogspot.com/2009/08/montavilla-farmers-market-takes-plunge.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here for the Trash or Treasure blog post</a>).  To date the program has saved about 31,802 pieces of waste!

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions?</h3>
<p><em>Why not just use compostables?  Aren't they green?</em></p>
<p>It's true that compostable serviceware does not contain fossil fuels like plastics do and that they can break down into compost after they're thrown away if they are processed in the right kind of facility. However, the production and distribution of compostable serviceware still requires fossil fuels. Growing crops for compostable ""bioplastics"" takes up land on the planet's limited space available for growing food crops. Bioplastic items are hard to recognize compared to regular plastics. Many bioplastics end up mixed into plastics recycling by mistake, causing contamination of recycling. There are limited commercial compost facilities in the U.S. to process these items properly, so they often end up in the landfill where they do not actually compost at all, but instead eventually break down and produce methane, a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Given all these factors, truly the most sustainable choice is to become a culture that chooses to reuse what we have rather than continue to produce and consume disposable items into perpetuity no matter what the cost to the planet.</p>
<p><em>You don't need staff do do this-- can I just volunteer?</em></p>
<p>We expect people will want to offer to volunteer-- this is great! There are many volunteer roles available at the market that we would be happy to discuss with you.  However, we've been at this since 2009 now, and we know how durable dish management works out with exclusively volunteer based support.  It requires highly accountable staff positions to execute it.</p>
<p><em>Why don't you fund this by raising vendor fees?</em></p>
<p>Our vendors, both in ready-to-eat food and our farmers, are small, and in many cases new businesses struggling to exist.  We do not think it is a viable option for our market to put the burden of this program that benefits the entire planet on their shoulders.  We hope the community that values Durable Dish will help pay for Durable Dish.</p>
<p><em>Why are rewards so expensive?</em></p>
<p>We want to money here to primarily go to the cause, not to printing t-shirts.  The rewards are little thank yous for a donation, not a purchase themselves.</p>

<p>We graduated high school in 2012 not yet positive about where our lives were heading. We couldn't afford college and we were not happy about where our lives were at. After some thought we both enlisted in the Marine Corps and were given a ship date in the delayed entry program. With the extra time on our hands we wanted to make a difference in not only our own lives but others too. We then decided to walk across America, as this had always been an interest of ours. This put us in a unique situation to help others through an organization. We immediately picked cancer as the cause because not only has it affected us greatly, but it affects everyone. It took hours of research to find which organization we wanted to use but we both agreed in the end that Livestrong was perfect. Livestrong does the things that other organizations forget about and they have the lowest percentage of funds going towards their administration. </p>
<p>Everyday we walk 15 to 20 miles. We started in CT and we're making our way to Huntington Beach, CA. Right now we reside in Lafayette, IN making our way to Chicago. At night we knock on doors and ask people if we can set a tent up in their yard. Time to time we get a free motel room but we generally sleep in a tent. Along this trip we have met so many cancer survivors, mothers of children who have died of cancer and many people who know others who have suffered from cancer. These people have given us the motivation we need to make it when the days get hard. They have made us truly passionate about what we do. They have showed us that we are out there making a difference. We have both seen what cancer does to a person and how horrible it is, it's indescribable. </p>
<p>By funding our trip you will not only help us make our way across the country but you will be helping many people struggling through cancer. As of right now we have enough money to make it through Illinois and Kansas. If we don't make our $1500 goal on Indiegogo then we won't get any of it. It's either 100% or nothing! Please help our cause!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $1500 to finish this trip. This money will be going towards essencials such as food and equipment we may need along the way. George got a cold a few days ago but because of our funds we had to push through it. It's important that in times where one of us is sick we are able to pause for a few days without the worry of money. </p>
<p>As you know, if we do not reach our $1500 goal, we don't get any of it. This doesn't mean you don't get your money back! In this case, you will be 100% funded back in return. Also, if you look on the right side of this page you will see three perks. These perks you can get if you donate the required amount. The amounts are $100, $150, and $500. All of these perks will be very interesting to say the lease. </p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello, I'm Anna Johnson. I'm a 17 year old high school student.</p>
<p>Growing up on the DelMarVa peninsula I developed a great love of the ocean. Living at the beach was so much fun! In the summer I enjoyed swimming, kayaking, crabbing and sunbathing. During the Winter months it could get a little monotonous. </p>
<p>My parents would take my brother and me to the local beaches to do a ""trash hunt."" We'd carry large trash bags and use a a long grabber tool. We would walk up the beaches and clear out all the garbage left behind. I was always so surprised at the amount of trash we would collect. We each would have full trash bags at the end of the day.</p>
<p>When I was older we moved to the DC metro area for my parents' work. I always wondered if anyone else was picking up the trash.</p>
<h3>About the Charity</h3>
<p>The goal of Crystal Clear Seas is to remove marine water detritus.</p>
<p>Crystal Clear Seas wants to educate on the devastating effects of plastic in our oceans. In addition to our messaging efforts, we will coordinate one nationwide beach cleanup per year. We intend on partnering with select communities throughout the US to keep our beaches free of garbage and debris. Shorelines and coastal areas are easy to access and getting the detritus before it has a chance to get into the ocean is paramount. Cleaning up near-shore and coastal regions is akin to turning off the faucet of human-made debris. We will continue outreach by developing Crystal Clear Seas ambassadors to help spread the word. As a stretch goal, for every town we partner with to clean their beach we aim to provide them with environmental technology to help extract plastic pollutants from their local waterways and oceans.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Clean beaches = clean water = clean health</p>
<ul>
<li>91% of plastic is not recycled</li>
<li>It takes at least 450 years for a plastic bottle to biodegrade</li>
<li>Over one million single-use plastic bottles are purchased every minute</li>
<li>1220 marine species are affected by plastic pollution</li>
</ul>
<h3>How will the Money from this Fundraiser be Used?</h3>
<p>The registration process is complicated, rigorous, and if applications are not prepared with exact precision, they will be denied.

<p>I am a student who has always been fascinated by science. I have often wondered how we can use the inventions to change the lives of the ordinary poor people. In my summer holidays I visited a village, near my hometown in India where the residents had to use candles at night to save money. Electric bills were eating into their meager income to the point that they had to choose between spending for their children’s education or for electricity. Using my pocket money savings ($100), I decided to donate energy-efficient compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs to twelve households. It was particularly challenging as some families were concerned with adapting a new form of radiance; nonetheless after explaining it would be beneficial to their lives, they considered it. A month later, those twelve households told me their electric bills had dropped from $3.24 a month to $0.60—a significant saving if your monthly income is $10. Encouraged by the success, I plan to extend my small experiment to 1,000 poor families in the coming summer. Your contributions would help bring in light into their lives. Saving electricity not only makes economic sense but also helps avoid the need to build more power stations and reduce carbon emissions thus making our planet more green and livable. </p>
<h3>How We Affect the Change?</h3>
<div>
<p>The money will be used to buy energy efficient compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs), bulb holders, switches and wiring to get them fixed in poor village homes. I plan to buy 8 Watt and 14 Watt CFL bulbs which give the same light as 60 Watt to 100 Watt normal incandescent bulbs. The normal bulbs cost Indian rupees (INR) 12 or $0.25 each whereas CFLs cost INR 100-120 or $2-2.50 each. Although the conventional bulb is cheaper, it has a shorter life span of 1-2 months compared with the guaranteed life of 3-5 years for CFLs, making them very cost effective. However, the initial high cost of the CFLs deters the poor from buying these. Given the small energy consumption of CFLs, it can help people save 80% of their recurrent electricity costs.. Also, because of the high consumption of the conventional bulbs, many poor people are unable to afford electricity and live in darkness using candles for lighting their homes. Providing them energy efficient CFLs will help bring light into their lives. </p>
<h3>We owe this Change to your Generous Help</h3>
<p>We plan to provide CFLs to about 1,000 families with poor living background free of cost (2-3 sockets per household). This will of course depend on the money collected. We will share the progress of our initiative with our contributors and have special perks for our supporters. If things go well and I have time, will also try to launch a small website or atleast a webpage. We believe that every penny counts and sincerely look forward to your contributions, however small they may be. We have special perks ranging from pictures of the people we help to the special caps and T-shirts. We have also initiated the “Edison Award” and “Green Ambassador Award” for the very special people that will help us to realize our dream of a “carbon free green world”. We look forward to your generous support.</p>
<h3>The Change Benefits All of Us</h3>
<p>According to a 2006 article published in fastcompany.com, if 110 million American households bought just one CFL and used it in place of an ordinary 60-watt bulb, ""the energy saved would be enough to power a city of 1.5 million people. One bulb swapped out, enough electricity saved to power all the homes in Delaware and Rhode Island. In terms of oil not burned, or greenhouse gases not exhausted into the atmosphere, one bulb is equivalent to taking 1.3 million cars off the road"". That's the law of large numbers--small action multiplied by large numbers. Making this happen will have a catalytic effect and help uplift the world's very poor, the world's almost ""forgotten"".</p>

<p><strong>Story Behind the Polar4 Arctic Expedition</strong></p>
<p>When I first visited the Arctic in March 2011, I was blown away by the overpowering beauty surrounding me in the rich landscape and clean nature. It was uncontaminated oasis amidst a world with so much pollution. I was there to film a documentary, and the more time I spent trying to capture the Arctic on film, the more I felt it begin capture and captivate me.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489610537/fzflw7cjt5jioush6hc7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I returned several times to the Arctic over the following years for the purpose of filming, and with each journey I felt more and more certain that I need to do something to help preserve it. Although it is one of the most untouched places on Earth, and the negative effects of climate change are more measurable there than anywhere else. Funding for scientists to thoroughly research changes in land and animal life is insufficient.</p>
<p>I realized I needed to do something about it. Thus one day in March of 2014, the idea for Polar4 was born.</p>
<p>The purposes of the mission are discovery and preservation. To discover, we will bring international scientists to conduct experiments they would not otherwise be able to finance related to climate change, animals and nature. To discover we will also search for the remains of the airship Italia mission lost there in 1928. To preserve, we will bring global attention to the Arctic through video footage, celebrities and media coverage of the experiments and the search for the airship Italia, to inspire the rest of the world to take action.</p>
<p>If we do not act now, the average temperature of planet earth will raise by as much as 4° by the end of the century. Desertification, extreme heat waves, tropical storms and rising sea levels are just some of the catastrophic impacts, that will affect millions of lives and entire regions of the world.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489610613/p92ndsghe1innml4udhm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is why I am asking you as a contributors to help us research and draw awareness to this area, helping not just us, not just you and your family and friends, not just the animals alive now, but all future generations of human, plant and animal life.</p>
<p>The Arctic is a powerful place but it is not strong enough to survive climate change and pollution on its own. The way things are going and the way that it is melting, the Arctic that I first encountered back in March of 2011 will exist for future generations only in old photos, videos and memories of those lucky enough to have seen it.</p>

<p><strong>Mission Details</strong></p>
<p>The voyage will begin in August 2017 in Tromsø, as 30 scientists and crew members board 4 sailboats and begin a 4 week journey. Each boat will have a different focus - one will focus on science, conducting 16 experiments, another on Arctic ice mapping, another on media and celebrities to bring attention to the cause, and still another on finding the airship Italia, lost in 1928. Because it will be Arctic summertime, we will have 24/7 sunlight to ensure we able to accomplish as much possible during the trip. As the Captain of the mission, I will decide when and in what order we do each experiment depending on water and weather conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons and Ways to Contribute</strong></p>
<p>We ask contributors to help us preserve the Arctic. We are doing this for you and we cannot do it without you. Our goal is to get 85.000 EUR of crowdsourced funding. This is the last 20% of the total budget of the expedition. But we need it and therefore ask for your support and give you great perks in return. If you contribute to our mission, you will be contributing to a planet with healthier air and water for generations and generations to come.</p>
<p>Your contribution will be used in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To help fund the 16 scientific experiments the scientists will perform, only with the full budget we can perform the 16 experiments as we planned.</li>
<li>To help support the expedition costs, rental materials and post-research and outreach after the expedition.</li>
</ul>
<p>How this will benefit you:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will benefit the health of the whole planet and this includes you and your family</li>
<li>You can contribute to something incredibly important to help save future lives</li>
<li>All the animals who live healthier longer lives in the Arctic would thank you if they could!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Our Impact is Your Impact</strong></p>
<p>The success of the scientific experiments, of the search for the lost airship Italia and of generating worldwide media coverage for the mission depends not just on me and the scientists and the crew on the boats during the mission, but on all of the people who contribute their energy and money to help us get there in the first place.</p>
<p>The more attention we draw to the Arctic, the more we can ensure funding for scientific missions and for campaigns for preservation in the future. Every person who donates becomes a part of the mission as well as a part of the legacy of any success we achieve. Just as a team of us will take this journey to the Arctic, an even bigger and equally important team of us will help us achieve the means to get there.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The Arctic Ocean combines freezing temperatures with volatile and unpredictable weather, meaning we will be at risk during the mission to severe and possibly life-threatening conditions. In addition, while on land, we will be surrounded by polar bears who do at times attack humans.</p>
<p>The crew and scientists will undergo rigorous survival and disaster training before the journey even begins, to ensure that we are prepared for every worst-case scenario. Each person on board will be aware of all emergency plans and trained in life-saving procedures should any kind of disaster strike. In addition, we will be in contact with emergency helicopter services in case of any medical emergency to ensure efficient and optimal care.</p>

This is the last 20% of the total budget of the expedition. But we need it and therefore ask for your support and give you great perks in return. If you contribute to our mission, you will be contributing to a planet with healthier air and water for generations and generations to come.
Your contribution will be used in one of the following ways:

To help fund the 16 scientific experiments the scientists will perform, only with the full budget we can perform the 16 experiments as we planned.
To help support the expedition costs, rental materials and post-research and outreach after the expedition.

How this will benefit you:

It will benefit the health of the whole planet and this includes you and your family
You can contribute to something incredibly important to help save future lives
All the animals who live healthier longer lives in the Arctic would thank you if they could!


Our Impact is Your Impact
The success of the scientific experiments, of the search for the lost airship Italia and of generating worldwide media coverage for the mission depends not just on me and the scientists and the crew on the boats during the mission, but on all of the people who contribute their energy and money to help us get there in the first place.
The more attention we draw to the Arctic, the more we can ensure funding for scientific missions and for campaigns for preservation in the future. Every person who donates becomes a part of the mission as well as a part of the legacy of any success we achieve. Just as a team of us will take this journey to the Arctic, an even bigger and equally important team of us will help us achieve the means to get there.

Risks and Challenges
The Arctic Ocean combines freezing temperatures with volatile and unpredictable weather, meaning we will be at risk during the mission to severe and possibly life-threatening conditions. In addition, while on land, we will be surrounded by polar bears who do at times attack humans.
The crew and scientists will undergo rigorous survival and disaster training before the journey even begins, to ensure that we are prepared for every worst-case scenario. Each person on board will be aware of all emergency plans and trained in life-saving procedures should any kind of disaster strike. In addition, we will be in contact with emergency helicopter services in case of any medical emergency to ensure efficient and optimal care.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is it?</strong></h3>
<p><i>Qallariy </i>(pronounced Qayarii) in Quechua means to start, to begin and definitely the present campaign is aimed to contribute to the opening of the first shop in Peru without disposable packaging.    We want to eliminate packaging not only by selling groceries in bulk, but also preparing fresh food using local supplies, handcrafting household products and promoting the use of recyclable containers for the purchase and storage at home.</p>
<p>Dry food such as grains, seeds, beans, nuts, coffee, beans, tea leaves will be sold in bulk from containers.  We will have an European mill to freshly grind quinoa and other cereals, and we will also have others grinders for coffee beans, cacao beans, Maras salt. Customers will be encouraged to bring their own containers, or purchase them from the store.</p>
<p>Most of our products will be sourced regionally or will be handcrafted in the workshop.  In fact, next to the store, we want to create a workshop in order to elaborate fresh and natural handmade food (bread, cakes &amp; pies, fermented vegetables &amp; drinks, vegan burgers, nut milks) and to achieve a low waste lifestyle (detergent &amp; cleaning refills done with Effective Microrganisms, shampoos refills, soaps, notebooks with recycled papers).  You won’t find countless brands for each product because the one we handmade with the best local resources, is enough.</p>
<p>So you will find our Kombucha made with coca leaves; our gluten free bread freshly baked in the <i>horno de barro</i> we have at home; our vegetarian handmade hamburgers just prepared and freezed; our potatoes from the field around Cusco just cut and freezed to you quickly prepare your French fries; our freshly milled local quinoa flour or flakes; our raw chocolate with the best cacao beans of the Cusco Region; our vegan soaps with fresh Peruvian fruits, vegetables and spices you can use also as bar shampoo; our natural liquid shampoo in refill; our eco-friendly laudry soap done with Effective Microrganisms; our notebooks and Midoris handsew with recycled papersour handmade bags and towels to go zero waste.  And  few imported products, as water purification systems, wooden dish brushes, bento boxes, stainless bottles.  In the rewards section, you have a first example of what we will sell in the shop.</p>
<p>We will put the pictures and the names of the people who are growing the food you eat, and the pictures of the fields where your potatoes, oranges, lemons, bananas, quinoa, quiwicha, are cultivated.</p>
<p>We will use also the sistem of bartrer, a traditional system here in the Cusco Region, with local producers.  We will prefer to buy quinoa, quiwicha, beans, etc. from small local producers we know how they cultivate their lands.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The impact</strong></h3>
<p>To act locally, as here in Peru, we need the economical support of those who are thinking globally, as YOU !!  As made clear by the climatic change, no country can remain immune from the impacts of global threats, so we have to work together to mitigate it.</p>
<p>All around the world people make use of plastic, not because of an individual election, but because nowadays everything is covered with plastic.  We want to follow the revolution that is happening all around the world,  where packaging free shops, supermarkets, restaurants are opening.  Sometimes the packaging hides the real value of the products tricking the buyer to purchase unhealthy food.  In our shop you will see how our food or products are prepared because the workshop will have large windows all around and each product wiil be labelled with its ingredientes.</p>
<p>In the workshop will work Peruvian women 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, with a contract and a fair salary.  We want to allow women to be independent in their family environment and to have time to live their lives apart from their work.</p>
<p>The shop will cater to Peruvians, foreign residents and tourists.  We want not only to offer a zero waste alternative to who is already motivated but also to educate people to select packaging free products.  For budget-minded shoppers, we’ll have not only organic, but also conventional products to offer.  Everyone should be able to afford to help the environment in the way they can.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>About us</strong></h3>
<p>We’re a Peruvian couple living in Cusco (Peru) engaged in promoting a sustainable happiness for our society.  To be coherent with this effort, we want to open the first packaging free and handcrafted products shop of Peru and South America.</p>
<p>As an environmental engineer with several years of managerial experience in different countries of the world, and a philosopher, photographer and designer we have the knowledge to implement the shop.  And most important, we feel passionate about this project.<br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Opening a shop needs a big investment. Money is needed for renovation, furnishing and to buy the first round of products to stock the shop. And there are operating costs like rent and salaries for employees.</p>
<p>In the end of January 2019 we will apply to a fund for start-ups, financed by the Peruvian Government, in order to develop and validate our business model, to finance the legal creation of our company and the promotion through innovative marketing forms.  At the beginnig we are willing to work for free in the shop to save money to invest in this project.</p>
<p>With the funds we are requesting to you, we want to pay the first 6 months of rent for a shop in Cusco (in San Blas neighborhood, if you know Cusco, the most picturesque part of the town), to buy <em>stainless</em><i>-</i>steel containers for products in bulk, glass containers for any kind of liquid (from kombucha to shampoos and detergents), to build wood structures to host the containers, to equip the workshop for the homemade production of food and drinks, to buy a Jumbo KoMo Mill to elaborate flours and flakes from organic Andean cereals, to buy the first round of groceries to sell and raw materials to be processed. </p>
<p>We want to open by May-June 2019.</p>
<p>Of course we have rewards!! Each reward will be handmade in our workshop with local resources, it’s an unique design, and we are sure you will love it. We know that not everyone lives in Peru that would like to show support so we are more than happy to send you something via air mail or by email if you select this option when available.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we are still going to use every cent towards our shop simply changing its size and adapting this to the funds we will be able to collect. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Maybe you are in a moment that you haven’t extra cash, but even in this case, you can help us so much !!! the most important thing is that you love our project.</p>

<p><strong>I have this crazy idea that saving this World is much simpler then we make it out to be.</strong> In my mind, it is possible. There are 2 problems we face in 2013, Climate Change and Hunger (I don't think either needs further explanations), these can be curbed with one solution, WE CAN solve these 2 major issues of our Planet Earth. What is the solution? Trees! Fruit Trees to be exact!</p>
<p>Fruit = food Trees = carbon absorbtion</p>

<p><strong>I live in South Africa, land here is furtile and trees grow easily, yet so many go hungry.</strong></p>
<p>I know what you are thinking, one fruit farm will not save everyone but my plan is to offer hiking, camping, picknicking and other paid for activities on the land. This income will be used for buying more land in other areas, planting more and more and more fruit trees!!!!!!!!!

<p>Just think of the Carbon emissions being sucked up.... The people being feed in a sustainable way.... This is one dream that keeps on giving!</p>
<p>About myself, I grew up on farms around the Eastern Cape, South Africa, I guess that made me accustomed to nature as climbing trees, growing veggies and looking for snakes were my childhood hobbies. To be perfectly honest, I still do the first two but since I now live in town there are no snakes to find except in mens trousers! I feel in harmony with nature, at one with the trees, they bring me joy (and oxygen). I've always been environmentally conscience, keen on greening the World and I have also always been exposed to poverty having lived in Africa my entire life.</p>
<p>I plan on planting the trees myself, with anyone else willing to dig a few holes(volunteers welcome). Imagine 40 000 trees... the food given, the  oxygen given, the carbon reduced.... It is sustainable...year after year.... 40 000 trees at least... That's A lot of food!</p>

<h3 lang=""en-US""><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">The Town of Panicale (in the province of Perugia, very close to Assisi in Umbria) has granted planning permission to transform Villa Missiano in a residential area, cutting down the ancient olive trees that surround it.</span></strong></h3>
<p lang=""en-US""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span>Villa Missiano is a historic building and has been recently renovated in its original style. The surrounding land is covered with olive trees and can produce about 10,000 litres of extra virgin olive oil (See Perk from €25). The building dates back to the nineteenth century and is built in a classic Umbrian style, with influences from nearby Tuscany. The villa also has six self-catering apartments and a swimming pool and can work as a farm (See other perks).</span></span></p>
<p lang=""en-US"">The owner lives in Brazil and is trying to sell this property because he is no longer interested in it. A construction company has come forward with an offer to purchase and has already obtained planning permission.</p>
<p lang=""en-US"">The builders’ plan is to build 12 single-family homes, which means inexorably cutting all the olive trees on the property.</p>

<p lang=""en-US""><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">If we reached the goal of €15,000, we will be able to rent the land and the farm for 1 year. But we need this exact amount. </span></strong></p>

<p lang=""en-US""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span>c. create an educational farm to teach people how to harvest olives, make olive oil and cook our traditional regional dishes (See Perk from €5).</span></span></p>
<p lang=""en-US"">d. create one or more campaigns to raise funds in order to purchase the property in 2014 (the owner would sell it for €1,000,000)</p>

<p>Now I have a ten-month old daughter and I would like to bring some wild flowers also to her mother. In order to do so, I need your help to preserve this valuable area from destruction.</p>

The Town of Panicale (in the province of Perugia, very close to Assisi in Umbria) has granted planning permission to transform Villa Missiano in a residential area, cutting down the ancient olive trees that surround it.
Villa Missiano is a historic building and has been recently renovated in its original style. The surrounding land is covered with olive trees and can produce about 10,000 litres of extra virgin olive oil (See Perk from €25). The building dates back to the nineteenth century and is built in a classic Umbrian style, with influences from nearby Tuscany. The villa also has six self-catering apartments and a swimming pool and can work as a farm (See other perks).
The owner lives in Brazil and is trying to sell this property because he is no longer interested in it. A construction company has come forward with an offer to purchase and has already obtained planning permission.
The builders’ plan is to build 12 single-family homes, which means inexorably cutting all the olive trees on the property.

WHO ARE WE?
We are local people, born and raised in this same area, among these trees. We decided to launch this campaign because we have always lived in this area, we care about its natural and historical value, and we want to fight for its preservation.
If we reached the goal of €15,000, we will be able to rent the land and the farm for 1 year. But we need this exact amount. 

During the rental period we will:
a. manage the olive groves, and hire workers for the harvest of the olives and the production of quality extra virgin olive oil (for experts, it is the “Muraiolo” type);
b. manage the holiday farm during holiday periods
c. create an educational farm to teach people how to harvest olives, make olive oil and cook our traditional regional dishes (See Perk from €5).
d. create one or more campaigns to raise funds in order to purchase the property in 2014 (the owner would sell it for €1,000,000)
 
The funds raised by the sale of our olive oil will go towards the accomplishment of this ambitious project.
 
We understand that in this time of crisis it is not easy to donate money. In this case we ask you to put the link to our campaign: www.indiegogo.com/savetheolives on your facebook page, twitter, website or anything that can get you in touch with many people, maybe attaching a photo from the online slideshow to your message.
 
ONE LAST APPEAL Letter from Cristiano
 
Dear friend,
My name is Cristiano. I was born in Umbria near these trees. As a child, I used to play in the fields with my friends, and on the way to school and back home I used to walk through the olive groves to pick wild flowers for my mother and my grandmother.
When I grew up, I left because I thought this place had nothing to offer me. I lived abroad, I worked in the world of tourism and now I have significant experience in this field.
 
 One day, when I was back here to visit my parents, I realized that this place had endless potential but the concrete was destroying it. It is a resource that belongs to the whole humanity and not to particular individuals. So I decided to move back and stay.
Now I have a ten-month old daughter and I would like to bring some wild flowers also to her mother. In order to do so, I need your help to preserve this valuable area from destruction.
 
If you come to visit us (Perk for a weekend or for a week's holiday), I will welcome you, take to your accommodation and have the pleasure to show you the beauties of this wonderful place.
 
I thank you very much for your interest and look forward to welcoming you here in the Green Heart of Italy.
 
Cristiano

You can be hands-on or hands-off; plant and prune your own trees, or just come by and collect the fruit once a year.  You'll be part of a community orchard where the community grows alongside the trees. A community orchard in Ombersley, WorcestershireThe offer:£150 for two trees of your own, or £100 for one tree, or £50 to be an honoured guest and fruit taster for life.For your cash contribution, you'll buy into a little patch of permanence, a community, a festival, a pick-your-own and a holiday, all wrapped up in an ecologically valuable bit of tree planting and wildlife habitat creation. With lots of people involved, all choosing their own variety of apple, pear, plum, hazel nut, medlar, cherry, mulberry, quince or whatever, our orchard will be a treasure-trove of varieties. I also imagine we'll need a little hay-bale building to store our tools and a fire-pit to sit around. So we need to raise £15,000. £10,000 to buy an acre of suitable land and the trees, plus a £5,000 contingency for site preparation and to ensure we stay on top of critical issues like fencing and grass cutting.The offer again:£150 for two trees of your own, £100 for one tree, £50 to be an honoured guest and fruit taster for life.That's £100 from 150 people. Totally do-able right? Yes, if you sign up, like, NOW!I'm Matt;I'm involved with community gardens and orchards here in the UK, and I've planted fruit trees all over the world: apples in Scotland, pears in Wales, avocados in Australia - even the stinky durian in Malaysia. Those trees are still cropping, but on someone else's land - I don't get to pick the fruit! I want to create an orchard where my friends and I can hang out and return to year after year. So what do you get? The size of a fruit tree is determined by it's rootstock Well, modern apple and cherry farmers might put more than a 1,000 trees on an acre of land, but let's plant the kind of trees that kids can climb.That would be more like 250 x  MM106 Rootstock (largish) trees per acre. Which means everyone can have a good sized tree of their own. What a legacy for the kids! We recently paid for pick-your-own cherries - £23 for a single basket of fruit. It was a joy to pick those plump shiny beauties, and they tasted good, but £23, seriously! 4 trips to a pick-your-own, or your own tree forever?Lovely cherries that cost a fortuneWhat could go wrong?Your tree could die. Pests could blight the leaves and fruits, and then the whole thing could be struck by lightning. You might lose interest and not visit your tree for years, decades. It would grown old without you. Whatever happens, the land remains, and trees can be replanted! Though pests and disease can be a problem, many hardy varieties soldier on unaided, year after year, producing delicious foodstuffs and creating a lovely environment (we've all seen venerable old apple trees, right?). Whatever happens, we'll deal with it, organically.And if you fail to turn up for a decade, was it a waste of your £100? No! The tree is still there, the community is still there, the carbon has been sequestered and the environment has been improved.Have tree. Visit country.
