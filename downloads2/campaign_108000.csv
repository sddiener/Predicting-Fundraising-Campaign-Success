<h2>PILOT EPISODE - <i>Which Hunt?!  </i>Part 1</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>
<strong>OCCUPY! </strong>The White House Sprites</h2>
<p>This project will be a series of short sketch &amp; music videos with puppets speaking truth to power.  Its main characters, three wise, musical sprites, live in the Oval Office and come out of the woodwork whenever the White House ain't workin' the way that it should work. The project takes aim at the U.S. executive branch of government, often rendering the President's actual words and actions in puppetry.  In acerbic, yet accessible song and satire, the White House Sprites school the President and entertain audiences with lessons in civics and ethics, gleefully reminding us all of the truths we still hold to be self-evident.</p>
<p><i>OCCUPY!  </i><i>The White House</i> <i>Sprites</i> seeks to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build community through comedy </strong></li>
<li><strong>Offer fun, accessible lessons in civics and ethics</strong></li>
<li><strong>Transform outrage into laughter and action</strong></li>
<li><strong>Boldly go where no live-action satire has gone before</strong></li>
<li><strong>Spread good karma and engage new audiences</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The support you pledge will enable us to produce four episodes, gather a following of viewers like you, and advance the project toward a revenue stream from partnerships with companies like YouTube, Funny or Die, Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon.  </p>
<p>Check back for <strong>Part 1 of our pilot episode</strong> <strong><i>Which Hunt?!</i></strong>, as well as  <strong>OCCUPY! The White House Sprites' music video</strong> <i><strong>Don the Con</strong></i> to be posted here soon!</p>
<p><i>OCCUPY! The White House Sprites </i>considers team diversity behind and in front of the cameras an essential part of this project's growth and success, not to mention its raison d'etre.</p>
<p>We are asking you to BE A PART OF OUR TEAM. Please contribute now and share our campaign!</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Producing quality programming with the finest talent and technology is never cheap. Some of the expenses are obvious: writers, composers, actors, puppeteers, musicians, video and audio engineers and editors, etc., but the hidden expenses are just as essential: Legal, accounting, graphic design, props, set, platform and credit card fees, taxes, social media, production management, and much more. In short, initial set-up fees run $9-15,000 and per-episode costs are about $6,000. Our budget spreadsheet is available upon request.</p>
<p>What's in it for YOU?! For starters: the chance to build a vibrant, creative response and a one-of-a-kind, positive community.  Plus, you can choose from a basketful of fun perks, including: advance copies of music and behind-the-scenes production access; a red carpet launch party; eavesdropping on a writing session,  recording session or video shoot; a build-a puppet workshop; and puppet lessons from our celebrity puppeteer. Not to mention screen credits and even a back-end piece of the action.</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>Wouldn't you like stick-it-to-the-man? Turn your rage into laughter? Build a fresh, informed, optimistic community? Reach potential new friends and allies? Feel more hopeful and positive about the future? Strike a blow for decency and restore dignity to the Presidency? We sure would.</p>

And holy shit, we FUCKING LOVE YOU. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.IT'S 2018 AND WE'RE MAKING BULIMIA OUR BITCH!   BINGE is a darkly comedic webseries inspired by Angela Gulner's decade-long battle with bulimia, and her ultimate recovery via treatment at a Partial Hospitalization Clinic. It explores the under-represented world of eating disorders in way that is authentic, moving... and a hell of a lot of fun.Last year, we released the Pilot episode of Angela's story. The response was out of this world.Not only did we garner over half a million views on YouTube and write-ups in major publications like IndieWire, Elite Daily, Bustle, Bust, and Buzzfeed, but we’ve also received thousands (and we mean thousands) of emails and comments from individuals all over the world who responded to this pilot and wanted to see more of it.  Which brings us to this campaign...The outpouring of support for this series has been too loud to ignore. We've got something special on our hands, and we're so eager to continue telling this story with you. So, get ready... we're making a full season of this show, together! Great question. Over 30 million people in the United States alone suffer from eating disorders. In other countries around the world, people suffer in silence because there is no talk of these illnesses at all. Eating disorders have the highest mortality rates of all mental illnesses, and yet very few films and television shows get them right.This population, this community, is severely under-serviced by the entertainment industry and it’s time for that to change.During this season of giving, we are asking you to support content that bolsters, inspires, and connects a community. Entertainment shapes our culture - so let’s shape entertainment.Join us in changing the world.But after that? Pizza.We are raising funds to make five additional 22-minute episodes. And while most half-hour television comedies have budgets of around $300,000 per episode, we will work long hours, call in all of our favors, and fight our damnedest to make this show the best it can be. We produced a premium-quality pilot for next-to-nothing... image what we can do with your support!Here’s what your hard-earned cash will provide us:
Begin shooting in early 2018.
Release the full season by the end of 2018/early 2019.
Pay our amazing cast and crew a little bit to for their time and overwhelming commitment to the project. They volunteered on the pilot, and we don’t want this project to doom them to a lifetime of living in cardboard boxes… unless, you know, they prefer that.
Feed our cast and crew (which seems kinda sorta important, as we are making content about eating disorders...)
Secure bigger and more visually interesting locations. Locations are one of the bigger costs in filmmaking, and since the majority of this project is set an a treatment clinic, we’ll need to afford a location that can tell that story.
A few celebrity guest stars!
Rent high end equipment that will allow for greater production value, and make this project really shine.
Edit the project before we’re dead. Post-production is a lot of work, and our editor, Dashiell, needs an adequate number of pudding cups in order to work.

But, the movements that have formed out of the need for acceptance and change, have shown us the power of unity. We've seen that real change can happen when we don’t let our differences overcome our capacity to love. But, in our daily lives, we see a huge disconnect from this, without the support of a group of people, we see people going back to ignoring what and who is in front of them.</p><p>We want people really see the person they pass on the street, to understand that they have a story- a reason for being where they are right now. We want people to know that a stranger without a roof over their head isn’t worth any less than we are and hey, maybe they’re not even that “strange.” If we can get even just one person to realize that the homeless are deserving of as much love and acceptance as anyone else, we think we’ll all have a little more hope.  </p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536779676/jlxmebfd33bfsoyokvll.png"" src=""""/></i></p><p>We plan to tell these stories over three seasons of eight to ten episodes but before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s focus on getting this off the ground.

She learns that these people are more than the “hopeless fool” or the “victim of unfortunate circumstances"" that they stereotypically represent. They become her companions because sometimes all you need at rock bottom are people who understand what it’s like being there.Under the Bridge is NOT... another one of those super depressing shows that make you question the meaning of everything. It's funny! It's a dark comedy series filmed in the style of ""The Office"" that also uses a mix of surreal and satirical elements to tell its stranger than fiction story. It'll make you laugh and it'll make you cry, but most importantly it will make the subject of homelessness more accessible to the masses by relating to its characters who we generally don't see.Homelessness is... an issue that affects over 100 million people worldwide and millions of Americans are just one paycheck away from becoming part of that statistic. We want Under the Bridge to give people a reason to talk about this often overlooked issue and we need YOU to make it happen. We will also be donating 10% of the total funds raised to The Coalition for the Homeless, the nation’s oldest advocacy and direct service organization helping homeless men, women, and children in New York City.Over the past 3 years developing this series, we’ve seen hate attempt to take hold of our world. But, the movements that have formed out of the need for acceptance and change, have shown us the power of unity. We've seen that real change can happen when we don’t let our differences overcome our capacity to love. But, in our daily lives, we see a huge disconnect from this, without the support of a group of people, we see people going back to ignoring what and who is in front of them.We want people really see the person they pass on the street, to understand that they have a story- a reason for being where they are right now. We want people to know that a stranger without a roof over their head isn’t worth any less than we are and hey, maybe they’re not even that “strange.” If we can get even just one person to realize that the homeless are deserving of as much love and acceptance as anyone else, we think we’ll all have a little more hope.  We plan to tell these stories over three seasons of eight to ten episodes but before we get ahead of ourselves, let’s focus on getting this off the ground. This Indiegogo campaign will allow us to hit the record button for our first episode (our proof-of-concept) and deliver it to you as a digital download before we get the series picked up.  At the same time, we’ll be completing our business plan and conceptual synopsis for the seven to nine subsequent episodes and we’ll keep you in the loop throughout the whole process! Then we’re really going for it–pitching to cable, network and streaming channels and participating in next year’s festival circuit. When Lee Schatzman, our actor/writer/producer, moved to NYC in 2015, he settled down in an illegal hostel for a few months. The experiences he had during this time inspired the creation of Under the Bridge.“The place was cheap. You could pay by the day so you'd see faces come and go. We'd sleep in a small room with 9 bunk beds–hardly any space to call your own. Needless to say, I got to know some of these guys really well–most of them were homeless and could only afford to stay in the hostel maybe one or two nights and then they'd be out on the streets for the rest of the week. It was sad when they had to go. I generally took them out with the money that I had saved. Sometimes they shared their stories and sometimes they were too ashamed. We'd drink our fill then they'd go on their way. Sometimes they'd come back and other times you'd never see them again.It was around that time that I had noticed a pattern in some of my friend's lives who couldn't seem to climb out of the ruts they were stuck in. It was the shame that held them down and kept them prisoner and we provided them with it.Often times we fail to see the full picture when we're confronted by something we don't understand. We hope this will help more people see the person in front of them, not a mistake. ” 
 Haunted by the deaths of her children who tragically perished in an apartment fire, Daisy became terribly addicted to crack cocaine to cope with her grief. She was eventually able to rise above her tribulations and founded a small corner of the shanty village under the bridge that it's members call ""Daisy's Pocket."" Daisy took BlockHead, Pop-Pop, and Jonesey under her wing there, and is driven by the need to find a place for them to live clean and healthy lives.
 Not much is known about BlockHead's life other than the fact that he's a runaway. He's the youngest member of the community and looks up to a lot of the guys in it which also makes him very susceptible to peer pressure and he often finds himself in trouble because of this. He's not the sharpest tool in the shed, which is why he’s been dubbed BlockHead, but he makes up for it by wearing his heart on his sleeve.  The longest living member of the shanty village under the bridge, Lump was once the heir to a powerful titan of the textile industry. Not wishing to follow in his father's footsteps, Lump went off the grid and walked away from it all. He is now is in search of inner peace. A greedy scoundrel and self-declared ""king under the bridge."" Roach was once just an average guy who became a drifter at a very early age. This eventually lead him under the bridge, where he finally became the leader he always saw himself as. He also thinks he's a distant cousin of the Queen of England.Watch Roach as he tries to raise money for the campaign.Check out this hilarious ""Telethon Promo"" that takes place within the world of Under the Bridge:

<li>Hi everyone! I'm <strong>Vaggelis Karadimas</strong> and I'm an animator. I animate in 2D (traditional, tradigital, digital puppetry and a bit stop motion). I 've studied history and archaeology and I have a PhD in history of modern Greek education. I'm disabled - because of an adamantinoma (I'm cured of the cancer though) - but I assure you that this only motivated me more to become an animator! I'm ""running"" vktoons.</li>
<li>I collaborate with <a href=""http://www.mabrida.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mabrida studio</a> (it participated in ""Loving Vincent"" - look at the ending titles) in a project named <u><strong><i>""The Treasure at the roots of the Tree of Earth""</i></strong></u>. It is a digital puppetry (or 2D CGI) animated web-series for children <strong>starring an Elf named Flower</strong> (Anthos in Greek) ,<strong> a kalikantzaros </strong> (a Greek kind of goblin) <strong>named Pimply </strong>(Spithourakias in Greek), a<strong> devil who hears in the name Seir</strong>, <strong>an angel named Omael</strong> and <strong>ancient Greek god Pan!</strong> They all try to find the Tree that keeps Earth at her place, each one for his very reasons. But that won't be that easy! The must solve problems on their way there, help some people, animals and several other creatures to keep on looking fot the Tree! Not only that, but they must overcome the obstacles that the great kalikantzaros <strong>Mantrakoukos, </strong>the archangel <b>Gabriel </b>and the great devil <strong>Foras </strong>will put on their way! The voice of Greek legendary voice actor <strong>Argyris Pavlidis </strong>will be heard there, along with the voices of his troupe. It will be consisted from 17 episodes of 7 minutes duration each.</li>

<p>Those who will help us, will not only allow us make the series a reality, but they will also open wide roads to a series of wonderful things that may happen;</p>
<ol>
<li>We will take advantage of the internet, which is the present and the future of tv.</li>
<li>We will bring children in Greece closer to animation both as educated viewers and as future creators!</li>
<li>We will push some positive messages via a humorist animated web-series to children around the globe! </li>
<li>We will persuade companies in Greece to invest in Greek animation!</li>
<li>We will contribute to create a culture of collaboration between Greek animators and between the Greek animation community and other departments related to animation industry worldwide! <strong><i>I</i><u><i>n general, someone who helps us, helps creating a greater market for animation productions where there was not one!</i></u></strong>
</li>
<li><strong><i>We will open roads for collaboration with companies and studios outside Greece!</i></strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Success </strong>to that project will give us courage to try to make it to <a href=""https://www.annecy.org/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Annecy Animation Festival, </strong></a>to work on <strong>more series</strong> and to think about starting a <strong>web tv dedicated to kids!</strong>

<p>So, you've reached here, so you think that perhaps it's worth to help us. <i>""Yes, but.. what will they do with the money and what will I get in return""?</i></p>
<ul><li>The amount of money we ask for is really nothing for an animated series. We want to collect 30.600$. <b>It is the amount of money we need to start and finish the series, even if the work we'll put in costs a lot more. </b> </li></ul>

<ol>
<li>The animator will get 7.350$</li>
<li>The amount of about 2.450$ will go to a heavy duty desktop computer.</li>
<li>2450€ will be spend for the payments of the voice actors.</li>
<li>1500€ will go to subtitle the series in Greek (for those with hearing problems), German and English.</li>
<li>1225$ will go to 3D prints and models (mostly for perks but also for general merchandise purposes)</li>
<li>3675$ will go to  preparing the merchandise of the series (we will collaborate with <a href=""http://pjbbrand.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pjb brand</a> for such a case)</li>
<li>610$ will go to three really handmade and amazing books</li>
<li>1835$ will go to text editing.</li>
<li>3675$ will be spend for ads and events and</li>
<li>the rest of the money will go for the other perks, taxes, fees etc.</li>
<li><strong>If we manage to get more money than we ask, this will make our life easier; These will go to hire more animators, buy additional software licences for the same reason and for educating them on the software!

<i>""And what if you don't get the money you are asking for""? </i>In that case, we'll still continue to catch the dream. Hopefully it will be enough money to pay the actors, the text editing and everyone else need to get paid, but the animator - that's me. Then come's the next step: <strong>I really believe in the power of that project and I believe it can go to Annecy Animation Forum via asifa hellas. And I believe that there will get noticed and get fully financed. </strong>But, I <strong>really </strong>believe that we'll make here too!!!</li></ul>

<p>You might think that this is just another animated series. Well, that's not a lie, but...In this case is more than a series. <strong>It can open the gates to a whole new situation in the field of animation in Greece and change the lives of Greek animators, create opportunities for collaborations with studios outside Greece and even trigger a boost to economy, since animation is still not getting the attention it should in Greece (imagine the potentials)!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can push the Greek market to take animation seriously. Greek animators would not have to migrate to get a job. Greek companies would finally understand that animation makes money for them too! More young people would find in animation a working opportunity. Collaborations with companies and studios outside Greece would help a better connection between different cultures. A new and vivid market would connect three continents and many cultures. Internet projects will gain points in the market of Greece and that means that it will also gain a global audience. <strong>And all these are in your power to become real! Your donation will change lives and the industry in a country and will affect animation world in many aspects!</strong>
</li>
<li>We have a team full of great people to achieve that. <strong>Mabrida Studio </strong>of the <strong>Sofianos Family </strong>is a well known studio in Greece and abroad (they are famous in Germany), mainly for its puppet theater and tv productions for kids and grown-ups. <strong>Recently it participated in the project of Oscar nominated ""Loving Vincent"". </strong><strong>​</strong><strong>Argyris Pavlidis </strong>is the most known voice actors in Greece since decades and his troupe the best one we have in Greece. He and all the other actors have given the Greek voice to the most known cartoon characters (Candy Candy, Pokemon, TMNT, Cloudy with a chance of meatballs etc).

<p>As I already mentioned, Greece is a hard place to animate, for several reasons. Me and my collaborators are trying to ""break"" these walls and persuade companies, animators and the Greek audience that <strong>we can successfully animate in Greece!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We've struggled with these difficulties and we can say we are winners. </strong>We are determined and we fully support the project. We're experienced, we know that kids already love the show (they've watched the older versions) and we include them in our team as ""special collaborators"" (as you can understand, we cannot show them to you). There is international recognition, the mabrida studio participated in a great project, <strong>so not only we have what it takes to make this series a success, but we can start thinking of the future possibilities and opportunities.</strong>
</li>
<li>We are a strong team, but not as big as those of foreign big studios. That means that we will have to put more effort to face difficulties that others solve with less effort.</li>
<li>The fact that Greece is a small market provides a great opportunity; <b>To create a market in an almost virgin ground! To educate children on animation as viewers and as creators, and that has an economic potential. Also, to ""educate"" the companies and studios in Greece to have a better look in animation and its potentials. </b>And that can lead once again to international collaborations. After all, it is a field which is connected directly with technology and animation today applies almost to everything! <strong>In our case, it can also help children get a solid ethical base tat will help them in their lives!</strong>
</li>
<li>The threats are that the economic crisis might have create a psychology to the Greek market, avoiding to take the risks needed for such an industry to become real. <strong>So, there comes you!

</div><p><u><strong><i>Now, let's go and find that Treasure!</i></strong></u></p></div>","Hi everyone! I'm Vaggelis Karadimas and I'm an animator. I animate in 2D (traditional, tradigital, digital puppetry and a bit stop motion). I 've studied history and archaeology and I have a PhD in history of modern Greek education. I'm disabled - because of an adamantinoma (I'm cured of the cancer though) - but I assure you that this only motivated me more to become an animator! I'm ""running"" vktoons.
I collaborate with mabrida studio (it participated in ""Loving Vincent"" - look at the ending titles) in a project named ""The Treasure at the roots of the Tree of Earth"". It is a digital puppetry (or 2D CGI) animated web-series for children starring an Elf named Flower (Anthos in Greek) , a kalikantzaros  (a Greek kind of goblin) named Pimply (Spithourakias in Greek), a devil who hears in the name Seir, an angel named Omael and ancient Greek god Pan! They all try to find the Tree that keeps Earth at her place, each one for his very reasons. But that won't be that easy! The must solve problems on their way there, help some people, animals and several other creatures to keep on looking fot the Tree! Not only that, but they must overcome the obstacles that the great kalikantzaros Mantrakoukos, the archangel Gabriel and the great devil Foras will put on their way! The voice of Greek legendary voice actor Argyris Pavlidis will be heard there, along with the voices of his troupe. It will be consisted from 17 episodes of 7 minutes duration each.


Those who will help us, will not only allow us make the series a reality, but they will also open wide roads to a series of wonderful things that may happen;

We will take advantage of the internet, which is the present and the future of tv.
We will bring children in Greece closer to animation both as educated viewers and as future creators!
We will push some positive messages via a humorist animated web-series to children around the globe! 
We will persuade companies in Greece to invest in Greek animation!
We will contribute to create a culture of collaboration between Greek animators and between the Greek animation community and other departments related to animation industry worldwide! In general, someone who helps us, helps creating a greater market for animation productions where there was not one!

We will open roads for collaboration with companies and studios outside Greece!

Success to that project will give us courage to try to make it to Annecy Animation Festival, to work on more series and to think about starting a web tv dedicated to kids!




So, you've reached here, so you think that perhaps it's worth to help us. ""Yes, but.. what will they do with the money and what will I get in return""?
The amount of money we ask for is really nothing for an animated series. We want to collect 30.600$. It is the amount of money we need to start and finish the series, even if the work we'll put in costs a lot more.  


The animator will get 7.350$
The amount of about 2.450$ will go to a heavy duty desktop computer.
2450€ will be spend for the payments of the voice actors.
1500€ will go to subtitle the series in Greek (for those with hearing problems), German and English.
1225$ will go to 3D prints and models (mostly for perks but also for general merchandise purposes)
3675$ will go to  preparing the merchandise of the series (we will collaborate with pjb brand for such a case)
610$ will go to three really handmade and amazing books
1835$ will go to text editing.
3675$ will be spend for ads and events and
the rest of the money will go for the other perks, taxes, fees etc.
If we manage to get more money than we ask, this will make our life easier; These will go to hire more animators, buy additional software licences for the same reason and for educating them on the software! We will also get payed in a more appropriate wya for the effort we will put in!


We also have these great perks for you! Most of them are about getting to know us better ad helping us see who our backers are! It's mostly about human connection! But we also offer some great stuff! Posters, yourselves animated (!) and with your voice on it(!!!) and you can get up to become a co-producer. In any case, your name will be immortalized on our social media accounts ;)















 

""And what if you don't get the money you are asking for""? In that case, we'll still continue to catch the dream. Hopefully it will be enough money to pay the actors, the text editing and everyone else need to get paid, but the animator - that's me. Then come's the next step: I really believe in the power of that project and I believe it can go to Annecy Animation Forum via asifa hellas. And I believe that there will get noticed and get fully financed. But, I really believe that we'll make here too!!!


You might think that this is just another animated series. Well, that's not a lie, but...In this case is more than a series. It can open the gates to a whole new situation in the field of animation in Greece and change the lives of Greek animators, create opportunities for collaborations with studios outside Greece and even trigger a boost to economy, since animation is still not getting the attention it should in Greece (imagine the potentials)!

You can push the Greek market to take animation seriously. Greek animators would not have to migrate to get a job. Greek companies would finally understand that animation makes money for them too! More young people would find in animation a working opportunity. Collaborations with companies and studios outside Greece would help a better connection between different cultures. A new and vivid market would connect three continents and many cultures. Internet projects will gain points in the market of Greece and that means that it will also gain a global audience. And all these are in your power to become real! Your donation will change lives and the industry in a country and will affect animation world in many aspects!

We have a team full of great people to achieve that. Mabrida Studio of the Sofianos Family is a well known studio in Greece and abroad (they are famous in Germany), mainly for its puppet theater and tv productions for kids and grown-ups. Recently it participated in the project of Oscar nominated ""Loving Vincent"". ​Argyris Pavlidis is the most known voice actors in Greece since decades and his troupe the best one we have in Greece. He and all the other actors have given the Greek voice to the most known cartoon characters (Candy Candy, Pokemon, TMNT, Cloudy with a chance of meatballs etc). One f my web projects - ""In the dungeons"" - was mentioned as a prime example of modern Greek animated satire in February's 2016 issue of Animation Magazine.

With such a team, we think it is certain the success of the series in Greece and wherever Greeks are found and we believe that it is something that will gain the love of children in the rest of world too!



As I already mentioned, Greece is a hard place to animate, for several reasons. Me and my collaborators are trying to ""break"" these walls and persuade companies, animators and the Greek audience that we can successfully animate in Greece!

The fact that Greece is a small market provides a great opportunity; To create a market in an almost virgin ground!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>1. Guests!</strong></i></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The audience of <i>The Emily Spinach Show </i>should feel represented by the the guests we hire to join Emily Spinach up onstage. The guests <strong>and </strong>the crew/artists/writers/creators <strong>(</strong><strong>employed by your very donations!)</strong> will provide perspectives, experiences, and identities that differ from our, the creators, own. <br/>We will use our positions of leadership to make <i>The Emily Spinach Show </i>a platform for traditionally under-represented voices and vocations. This is imperative to the success, growth, and impact of our show.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>vocations like...</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>dancers, actors, poets, musicians, writers, artists, animators, city officials, custodial workers, doctors, lawmakers, teachers, scientists, caregivers, designers, therapists, managers, activists, electricians, physicians, technicians, counselors, &amp; more!</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>2. Interviews!</i></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> Emily Spinach will get the chance to sit down with every guest in an interview. Questions posed by Ms. Spinach will range from, <strong>“How do you deal with bullies?</strong>” to <strong>""What are you very, very afraid of?"" </strong>to<strong> </strong>“<strong>If you got to eat free pizza every single day for the rest of your life, but you’d also burp every two minutes, and also your burps would come out kinda purple-y...would you?”</strong><br/><i>(the answer to that is yes, obviously)</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>3. Storytelling!</i></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Before actual filming begins, we’ll ask our guests for a childhood anecdote or lesson they would like to see come to life on <i>The Emily Spinach Show. </i> With contribution from hired artists when the storytelling calls for it, we'll craft a film, animation, skit, etc., that retells said story in a creative, fun, and accessible way. <br/><br/> Each episode will revolve around one or two concrete ""themes,"" based on the stories that we write and collect from our guests. A ""theme"" could be something like, <strong>""Why It's Very, Very Okay To Cry No Matter Who You Are,""</strong> <strong>""Animals and Plants and Why We Love Them So Much!!!"" </strong>or <strong>""Things  That Scare Us A Lot or A Little!""</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Every episode will have a musical guest -  a real band or musician that we hire to play a<strong> kid-friendly song. </strong>Imagine a Broadway performer belting out an original piece about the importance of asking for help on one's math homework,  a very cool punk band singing about making friends in the cafeteria, or a talented violinist who gives a rousing rendition of “Itsy, Bitsy, Spider.” </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>If you're under 6 years old,</strong> you're going to love<strong> </strong>the larger-than-life characters, fluffy stuffed animals, and the bright and warm aesthetic of Emily Spinach's world. Also, the music, games, silly skits, and storytelling. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>If you're between 6 and 12,</strong> you'll really like the cool animation, the humor, the music, and the stories. You'll be old enough to dig some of the bigger themes of the show, and may even be starting to think about what you want to be when you grow up! You may be interested to learn about careers you've never seen up close, like, <i>Historian </i>or <i>Playwright.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>If you're between 12 and 18,</strong>  you're going to like learning about the wide <strong>variety </strong>of things you can <strong><i>do</i></strong> and you can <i><strong>be. </strong></i>You'll like the younger musicians and artists we invite on the show, and, you'll appreciate the dry delivery and unrelenting over-confidence of Emily Spinach.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>If you're 18 - 100,</strong> yeah, here's what's up, you're ALSO going to love it! We bet you'll actually sit down with your kids and watch with them!</p>

</div></div>","Hi!! Thanks for being here!!We're Rob & Emily!

We're the creators of the promo you just watched! 
We're actors living in NYC! Oh, yeah, and we're married! 
that's us on our wedding day :)

""Cute! But...what is The Emily Spinach Show?""


The Emily Spinach Show is a talk/variety show with guests, musical performances, segments, games, and a kooky cast of characters for children of all ages!The Emily Spinach Show values empathy, kindness, inclusion, vulnerability, feelings, and joy!
""What would an episode look like?""
I thought you'd never ask!!!
On our show, with your donations, we're gonna have...

1. Guests!
The audience of The Emily Spinach Show should feel represented by the the guests we hire to join Emily Spinach up onstage. The guests and the crew/artists/writers/creators (employed by your very donations!) will provide perspectives, experiences, and identities that differ from our, the creators, own. We will use our positions of leadership to make The Emily Spinach Show a platform for traditionally under-represented voices and vocations. This is imperative to the success, growth, and impact of our show.
vocations like...
dancers, actors, poets, musicians, writers, artists, animators, city officials, custodial workers, doctors, lawmakers, teachers, scientists, caregivers, designers, therapists, managers, activists, electricians, physicians, technicians, counselors, & more!
2. Interviews!
 Emily Spinach will get the chance to sit down with every guest in an interview. Questions posed by Ms. Spinach will range from, “How do you deal with bullies?” to ""What are you very, very afraid of?"" to “If you got to eat free pizza every single day for the rest of your life, but you’d also burp every two minutes, and also your burps would come out kinda purple-y...would you?”(the answer to that is yes, obviously)
3. Storytelling!
Before actual filming begins, we’ll ask our guests for a childhood anecdote or lesson they would like to see come to life on The Emily Spinach Show.  With contribution from hired artists when the storytelling calls for it, we'll craft a film, animation, skit, etc., that retells said story in a creative, fun, and accessible way.  Each episode will revolve around one or two concrete ""themes,"" based on the stories that we write and collect from our guests. A ""theme"" could be something like, ""Why It's Very, Very Okay To Cry No Matter Who You Are,"" ""Animals and Plants and Why We Love Them So Much!!!"" or ""Things  That Scare Us A Lot or A Little!""

 
4. Segments! 
Segments like  “Emily Spinach Interviews The Squirrels In Central Park,"" or ""Emily Spinach Tries To Get To Know Every Dog That She Sees In The Span of Ten Minutes"" or ""Emily Spinach Dances Around Like A Joyful Muppet""  or ""Emily Spinach Calls You About Your Car's Extended Warranty"" will get Emily Spinach out of the studio and into New York City!
5. Characters!
 Characters like ""Carmichael the Mouse"", ""Chicken,"" and ""The Mime"" will star in short skits and sketches, filling out the world of Emily Spinach!
 FUN FACT ALERT!Carmichael is highly regarded in the Underground Comedy Scene!(Very underground)(It's...it's literally underground)

6. Games!

The games played by Emily Spinach and her guests will all rely heavily on “kid logic.” These games are for giggles and for making Ms. Spinach and her grown-up guests look extremely goofy,  of course. 
Don't mind us, just being flirty backstage! <3
 
7. Music!
Every episode will have a musical guest -  a real band or musician that we hire to play a kid-friendly song. Imagine a Broadway performer belting out an original piece about the importance of asking for help on one's math homework,  a very cool punk band singing about making friends in the cafeteria, or a talented violinist who gives a rousing rendition of “Itsy, Bitsy, Spider.” 

""What ages is this for, exactly?""
Well... all ages! 
If you're under 6 years old, you're going to love the larger-than-life characters, fluffy stuffed animals, and the bright and warm aesthetic of Emily Spinach's world. Also, the music, games, silly skits, and storytelling. 
If you're between 6 and 12, you'll really like the cool animation, the humor, the music, and the stories. You'll be old enough to dig some of the bigger themes of the show, and may even be starting to think about what you want to be when you grow up! You may be interested to learn about careers you've never seen up close, like, Historian or Playwright.
If you're between 12 and 18,  you're going to like learning about the wide variety of things you can do and you can be. You'll like the younger musicians and artists we invite on the show, and, you'll appreciate the dry delivery and unrelenting over-confidence of Emily Spinach.  
If you're 18 - 100, yeah, here's what's up, you're ALSO going to love it! We bet you'll actually sit down with your kids and watch with them!
And if there aren't little ones around to give you an excuse to sit down and indulge in some joyful silliness, it's all good. Go ahead and join the club! We're doing this for you, too!

""That reminds me, what's up with all the stuffed animals?""
Just like Emily Spinach has her co-host Alice The Snake by her side, every guest/grown-up on The Emily Spinach Show will be accompanied by their very own stuffed animal ""friend."" They are extremely good actors to have on set. Very committed!

   


""Adorable! And... who's Emily Spinach?""
 Emily Spinach is the host of The Emily Spinach Show, of course! ; )
Emily Spinach is kooky, confident, uncoordinated, and over-the-top. Most importantly, she's a good listener, and treats everyone who joins her onstage as the most exciting, important person she's ever met - because they are!
The name ""Emily Spinach"" is a nod to Alice Roosevelt,  a rule-breaking socialite and gifted writer. Alice was President Roosevelt's daughter, infamous for proudly ignoring the gendered expectations put on her by high society. Basically, she was a very cool broad!

            https://thoughtcatalog.com/jeremy-london/2019/0...""Alice Roosevelt was known for antics like smoking on the White House roof, carrying a snake in her purse, and betting at horse races. Her parents swallowed their aggravation because the public clearly adored her."" (http://drdeereallifesuperheroes.blogspot.com/)That snake in her purse was her pet, named Emily Spinach, a fact that delighted us so much we knew we had to incorporate it somehow into our show. To round out our homage to Ms. Roosevelt, we have named Emily Spinach's co-host, Alice The Snake. The ol' swap-a-roo!
 https://thoughtcatalog.com/jeremy-london/2019/0...

""Sweet! But, can I just ask...why are you making this?""
We want to collaborate on something ""big"" by using our own skills and training to change the world. 

...and this world needs changing, baby!Photo Cred: Alice The Snake (from her NASA days)
We also happen think that there is something missing from the overwhelming landscape of children's television, as two ""grown-up kids"" who were raised with programming like Mister Rogers. He imagined and then realized a space for children to understand the chaos of the outside world, all within the gentle confines of his neighborhood. The Emily Spinach Show will take that concept and run with it (literally, and all throughout New York City, I've heard! ) to create programming that is inclusive, fun, and creative for audiences in 2021 (and beyond!)
Mister Rogers, LeVar Burton, Bill Nye, Shari Lewis, and Jim Henson paved the way.Will you help us add Emily Spinach to the list?


""Okay, I'm in, how can I help?""
We need to raise $30,000 during this 60 day campaign.
""Why 30k?""
$30,000 is the amount of money it'll cost to produce the pilot episodeof The Emily Spinach Show.
""What will my donation contribute to?""
2 - 3 Guest Contracts + BandLodging For Any Out-of-Town TalentFull Crew HiresSpace RentalProps/Costumes/SetFood/SuppliesMerchandisingLegal Fees 
""Are there perks if I donate? I love perks!""
YES! Our perks are designed by the amazing Kat Schober! 
You could put this tote right there on your floor @ home(right next to your fav single sunflower & green shoes!!!)
 
""So, you raise the money, then what?""
Then, we film the pilot! And dance around! Wahoo!We are aiming to shoot in Late summer/Fall 2021!
After we film the pilot, we'll put it in front of folks in the industry who could potentially give it a platform or a network!! Again, wahoo!
If no one is interested at that level, that's fine, because we're going to make it anyway! We'll release the pilot online and use ad revenue and merchandise sales to continue producing episodes, establishing our show as a web series. 
""What if...you DON'T raise the money?""
  Well, we'll probably dance less, but we're still going to do it anyway!
If we don't raise the full 30k, we'll use what we do raise and continue saving our own pennies until we have the $30,000 needed to produce a well-made pilot. 
Basically, we're going to make this happen no matter what!
But with your help, we can produce an amazing pilot that much sooner, employ more artists and writers, and really nurture an exciting future for The Emily Spinach Show.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>SWEAT:  a serial comedy written by Robert Christophe and Kim Waldauer, the creators of the hit web series <i>Cube News 1</i>  and the <i>Adventures of Cube Girl</i>.</p>
<p>Welcome to the SWEAT Indiegogo campaign. This show is a passion project for us for two reasons: the first is that we have worked in the fitness business, been athletes, and presently own and operate a gym in Burbank CA.  It's a subject that we know inside and out because we've lived it. The second reason is that as artists we both feel a need to make people laugh right now and to create joy rather than fear. So we're going to tell a story about 5 very different people with different politics, values, and desires that are essentially in the SAME BOAT and have to find a way to keep their boat afloat.  <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>That boat is a neighborhood gym on the brink of failure. The gyms' owner, Rose, is a personal trainer to a Hollyw</span>ood<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> star. He's on his fourth come back and </span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>needs rehab more than exercise.  Her Latin dance instructor is on the run from ICE and her father who runs a  Mexican Cartel. Her yoga instructor is an extreme right-wing yogi.  The gym's head weight trainer came to Los Angeles to be a rock star -- 40 years </span>too<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> late.  And finally, the guy she bought the gym from still hasn't left, but he is spending her money on his empty karate classes.

SWEAT:  a serial comedy written by Robert Christophe and Kim Waldauer, the creators of the hit web series Cube News 1  and the Adventures of Cube Girl.
Welcome to the SWEAT Indiegogo campaign. This show is a passion project for us for two reasons: the first is that we have worked in the fitness business, been athletes, and presently own and operate a gym in Burbank CA.  It's a subject that we know inside and out because we've lived it. The second reason is that as artists we both feel a need to make people laugh right now and to create joy rather than fear. So we're going to tell a story about 5 very different people with different politics, values, and desires that are essentially in the SAME BOAT and have to find a way to keep their boat afloat.  That boat is a neighborhood gym on the brink of failure. The gyms' owner, Rose, is a personal trainer to a Hollywood star. He's on his fourth come back and needs rehab more than exercise.  Her Latin dance instructor is on the run from ICE and her father who runs a  Mexican Cartel. Her yoga instructor is an extreme right-wing yogi.  The gym's head weight trainer came to Los Angeles to be a rock star -- 40 years too late.  And finally, the guy she bought the gym from still hasn't left, but he is spending her money on his empty karate classes. Add a host of Los Angeles narcissists, steroid overdosing muscle-heads, and badass Zumba seniors and you get a hilarious story about a group of people who work really hard to almost make their dreams come true.  Our goal for the first season is to raise $50,000.  Reaching this goal will allow us to shoot eight 10-minute episodes and introduce a cast of incredibly funny actors to the world.  Please support us by choosing a perk and following our show. 
IF WE DON""T REACH OUR GOAL?
The short answer is we'll keep going until we do, or we shoot with whatever we raise, but we are making this series because we believe it's truly a great show.
Our motto is:  Invenimus viam aut faciemus (We will either find a way or make one.)
When we reach our goal the money will go mostly to production costs:Camera Equipment, production sound, props, art, lights and paying actors a stipend.
We've projected a budget of $5000 per episode,
We'll hold $5000 for post services (paying the editors)  and $5000 for marketing (paying the webmaster) which will largely be carried out through social media.

My name is Dan Snow and I'm one of the Founders of HistoryHit.History is my life. I’ve been lucky enough to make TV history documentaries for the past 15 years and my shows have been watched 100s of millions of times across the world on channels such as the BBC, PBS, History Channel, Discovery and National Geographic. Together with the HistoryHit team I also started the HistoryHit Podcast which is a ‘Best of iTunes 2015 & 2016 award winning History show that's downloaded 1 million times a month.We'd love to invite you to become a Founder Member of HistoryHit.TV and play an important role in our mission to preserve the future of great history storytelling. Pictured with Sir David Attenborough and Michael Palin CBEPledge to get early access, great perks and discounted subscriptions! Intelligent Documentaries for Intelligent Viewers Around The WorldTraditional broadcast TV, by the nature of its broad audience, has a challenge when it comes to making intelligent documentaries for people with a passion for history. The need for these channels to make films for a wide audience who often have little background knowledge of historical events results in documentaries that can often appear dumbed down to those with a deeper interest in history. As a channel dedicated to high quality, intelligent programming, we will deliver a level of documentary better suited to our audience - and without the need to chase ratings. Distinctive, Deeper and Definitive

 
As a video-on-demand service we won’t be restrained by schedules and programme lengths that traditional TV has to conform to.  This means we can approach history subjects in new and exciting ways.We want to take topics and themes and cover them in richer and more comprehensive detail than any TV channel has ever done before.  We’ll be able to show films of varying lengths featuring in-depth interviews with world experts and historical communicators, as well as giving behind the scenes access to incredible locations, historical events and festivals, alongside traditional 60-minute documentaries. This will allow us to offer a far greater level of historical knowledge on screen than has been available on TV up to now - helping us achieve our goal of becoming the ultimate documentary resource for historical content. Great Documentaries and Fantastic Original SeasonsHistoryHit will have both new and original documentaries as well as great documentaries from recent years that are no longer available to see.We’ll be carefully curating these in a number of different ways: 
by asking our Founder Members about the subjects they’d like featured on HistoryHit;
by putting the HistoryHit team’s favourite documentaries and subjects on HistoryHit;
and finally, by asking our favourite historians to choose films they’d like to share with you.
Alongside and accompanying the licensed documentaries and new programmes, there will be a range of additional films that allow us to expand beyond the traditional 60-minute documentary We will be using the funds you pledge to make sure that we have the best possible history films for you to see – and by pledging and becoming a Founder Member, you’ll have a direct influence on the documentaries on the channel. A Channel That Listens to its MembersMainstream broadcasters operate a commissioning system where one or two people decide what they think you want to watch.

<h3>CAMPAIGN UPDATE</h3>
<p>We made it to our main goal, and filming has begun on The Last Airship Series One! However as we have expanded the script and during filming to improve the series, we are keeping the crowdfunding open for new backers to come onboard and help improve the post-production and promotion side of things, to make the series the best it can possibly be, and to allow us to get the series seen by as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Any additional equipment will not go to waste - the main cast and crew are already in discussions for a second series to be shot in 2018...</p>

<h3>Getting Airborne </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Welcome to 'The Last Airship', a Steampunk comedy-adventure webseries following Captain Morstan and his crew, Lupo and Volpa, as they attempt to prove that airships can compete with high powered steamships when crossing the Atlantic, in an attempt to keep the age of dirigible travel alive! Along the way they face difficulties - often self inflicted owing to a combination of clumsiness and bickering, but the result is always exciting and fun to watch!</p>
<p>That is the goal! That is the short webseries which we will be releasing in the Autumn of 2017, but we need help to get the production levels way up into the air! </p>
<p>We already have the script, written by myself, Greg Chapman, a professional comedy performer, writer and videomaker, and I'll be directing, doing the majority of the edit and effects, and also playing the role of Lupo.</p>
<p>I'm joined by Patrick Barry and Felicity Hawthorn, who have agreed to give up their time to co-star in this project, and we are honoured that the fabulous Steampunk band 'Kiss Like Ether' have allowed us to use their song, 'Flight to Fall' as our title track. Even more amazing for me, as it was this song that originally inspired the writing of this series. I have also had a number of other people from the Steampunk community volunteer to fill some of the vital guest-star roles!</p>
<p>So we have a lot of what we need to make the series, and I am going to put all the time in to make sure that we have a fabulous series at the end of the project. However, we really need to improve some of our equipment to really get the best results from the talent who have offered their time to us!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
</div><div>
<p>The money from our initial goal will be going into three main places, camera, greenscreen and studio space. While I have certain equipment which I have used to film my Condensed Histories Webseries over a number of years, this equipment is getting old, and lacks the image quality and definition which I see needed for a webseries of this nature. With a lot of editing and effects work needed, we need a better quality of camcorder and a larger greenscreen, as well as hiring a space to set these up in.</p>
<p>While £1050 may sound a lot, this is nothing in the world of budgets for a series, but we are going to be shooting inexpensively while keeping the production values as high as possible, which is why currently the plan is to shoot almost entirely on greenscreen with a combination of miniature and CGI sets, and a few location shoots.</p>
<p>If we exceed this initial target, the next step will be to start looking at building physical sets for some of the main locations, such as the interiors of the Airship, which would be our ultimate goal - if not for the first six-part series, then for other series down the line!</p>
<p>We decided to crowdfund so that we can create the best quality series, but still release it for free at the end of the process. Also we wanted to be sure our crowdfunders get to be a part of the creative process - not just through updates and videos on here, but also by offering at almost every level of 'Perk' the chance for you to appear within the series in some form or another. A lot of projects like this just allow for names to be listed in the credits - but we'd want our supporters to actually have the chance to spot their faces within the final series!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we exceed our goals, if we hit £1500 we can vastly improve the sound recording of the series, and if we reach £2000 that would allow us to build physical sets for some of the main locations in the series!</p>
<p>Following the shoot, any equipment or sets will be used to help on other video projects including the Condensed Histories Webseries, as well as being used to hopefully create a second series of 'The Last Airship'!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Help Us Fly!</h3>
<p>We will be making this series, and we really want it to stand up as a great, fun series to watch, but also as an option to point to when people ask the ever present question 'What is Steampunk?'. </p>
<p>Once the series is out I will be pushing and promoting it as much as possible, to really let as many people as possible around the world get a chance to see it - and so I want to have made the best possible series to showcase a genre and style that I am particularly fond of - and in particular pushing how much fun it can be, and how inclusive!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making a webseries is hard work, and will take time. My biggest risk is a delay in this series coming out - if we don't get all of the funding then I will be spending a lot longer in the edit to get the best out of the footage we have.</p>
<p>However, this series will get made! I have a fabulous team behind me, and I am used to producing shows and videos on a deadline, and a budget! I have a strong cast, fine music, and the time and ability we need, so even if we miss our goal, you will still see the finished series by the end of 2017!</p>
<p>Of course, with luck we will exceed our goals, and the webseries will be better than any of us dare hope!</p>

<h3>Sexy. Sunny. Shitty.</h3>
<p>Los Angeles has established itself as a mecca for dream-seekers. That's where fame and fortune are to be made, right? The Statue of Liberty is on the wrong coast, right?</p>
<p>For some, maybe. Not if you're one of the millions whose experience has been a little more <i>Blade Runner </i>than <i>La La Land. </i>Not if you've felt like a small, pale guppy in a sea of tanned barracudas. And certainly not if you've sat in @#$%ing hours of traffic for that lame, blink-and-you-miss-it audition.</p>
<p>WE FEEL YOU.</p>
<p><i>I Hate LA </i>is about trying to make a life when it feels like life isn't loving you back. It is for every dreamer dealing with reality: every aspiring artist with a day job, every bad flirt looking for romance, and of course, everyone who's ever had a shitty roommate. </p>
<p>But most of all, it's about making those dreams happen in the end - one way or another.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Creators</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Angie Campbell </strong>is an actress, writer, and Diet Coke connoisseur currently residing in the ""Hollywood"" of the Midwest--Milwaukee, Wisconsin. She tried living in California 3 different times and failed miserably, the third time most notably. The three weeks (yes, you read that correctly) she resided there the third time inspired her to do what all great writers do: turn her pain into entertainment for the rest of the world. Thus, <i>I Hate LA </i>was born. </p>
<p><strong>Emma Baker </strong>is an actress, writer, and pogo stick aficionado living in the Midwest's glitziest and windiest city. She likes to think she's killing it at life far more often than she really does, and dreams of owning a pet hedgehog named Fernando. She's been to LA once, but went rogue at Warner Brothers Studios and sat in a lot of traffic, so she feels like she gets the idea.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are hoping to raise $8,000. What does this pay for, you ask? Equipment, crew, and post-production! It took 27 hours to shoot the first episode - and that doesn't include pre- or post-production! So far, our cast and crew have kindly donated that time, but they are incredibly skilled people who could be commanding a day rate for their work. We want to at least offer them a stipend for their services! We also borrowed several thousand dollars' worth of equipment to film - likewise, we would like to give our generous lenders something in return.</li>
<li>Also, people on film sets eat <i>a lot</i>. </li>
<li>Let us reward your generosity! Check out some of our perks on offer. What do <i>you </i>hate most about L.A?</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're going to honest with you: we're not saving lives here. (This is not the some genius sleep apnea treatment, or the RompHim.) But here's what we're about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Female filmmakers</strong>. Our director, writers, producers, and editor are all ladies. Can we get a hell yeah for tipping the ratio in the film industry?</li>
<li>
<strong>The struggle.</strong> L.A. is known for chewing people up and spitting them out, but navigating life is rough no matter where you live. This show celebrates the fortitude of dreamers: those who get up every day and need the encouragement to go on just one more audition, write one more song, run one more mile, go on one more interview, make one more student loan payment. (Just kidding. We'll all be making student loan payments forever.)</li>
<li>
<strong>The laughter. </strong>Everything right now seems so damn dire. (And, in many ways, it is.) But being an activist/anarchist/revolutionary is <i>exhausting</i>, and so is watching murder after murder on <i>Law and Order. </i>So we humbly present you with a restorative: delightful awkwardness. (Not British-level, but, like, pretty up there.)</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, we want to have a good time, tell weird, funny stories, and make you feel better about how badly <i>your</i> last date went. And also world peace.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are a lot of voices struggling to be heard. (We mean artistically and people who just want to bitch in general.) Given all the contenders, it's understandable that not everyone gets to rise above the crowd, and of course, that may be the case here. But (but, we say!), the next <i>Broad City</i>/<i>Eragon</i>/Tommy Wiseau has to come from somewhere, and we sure as hell can't see why it shouldn't be us. (Our parents taught us that if you believe, you can do anything, and it <i>almost</i> worked that time we tried to fly from jumping off the roof, so we're going off precedent here.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We would appreciate any and all help we can get - and not just financially-speaking! If you're willing, please share/follow on Facebook, Twitter (@ihatela_show), Intstagram (@i_hate_la_show), your Tumblr, MySpace, etc. </p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Black Girl Single is the story of thirty something Adrienne Walters. She has a great life, but the one thing she dreams of eludes her-- a healthy and lasting relationship. Adrienne keeps meeting the wrong men. At thirty-two most of her friends are married and as the lone single she's wondering where she went wrong. </p>
<p>Adrienne's story isn't new--finding love is never easy. But dating in a town where women outnumber the men, guys date the way people channel surf, and a woman's value is found not only in her good looks, but in where she works and went to school, the competition is fierce. And in the age of online dating and social media, Adrienne is seeing firsthand how frustrating dating can be when you're searching for ""the one"". As Adrienne embarks on a series of crazy dates and comical disappointments, she begins to consider that her prayers will continue to go unanswered and she begins to question God and whether he has a plan for her life. Feeling like she's reached wits end,  Adrienne makes a decision, one that could make or break her chances of ever finding love. </p>
<p>Black Girl Single will definitely make you laugh out loud and remember your own dating experiences, but it also works to build a larger conversation about holding on to your faith when life doesn't go as planned. We hope Black Girl Single promotes the idea of waiting for God's best and living your best life while you wait.</p>
<h2>Another story about being a single woman? Why?</h2>
<p>Adrienne's story is more than just a retelling of the hilarious stories women share with their friends over wine. It's an exploration of what it means to be a woman of color in a world where options often feel limited. It's a nod to women who make their own rules. It's a statement about how the sexes interact in a culture that's gender biased. And it's an experiment on what can happen when we make drastic changes in the most important parts of our lives.</p>
<p>This story is important because we're constantly bombarded with negative images of Black women, warnings that Black women are destined to be alone, statistics that show most of us as unmarried single mothers, and countless articles that tell us we'd better move to Europe if we ever want to find love. Is anyone else sick of this narrative? Whether those narratives are real or not, Black Girl Single is about growth, independence, and the faith to press forward and shake things up to get what you ultimately want. </p>
<p>And on a lighter note, this series a great illustration of just how crazy these streets are when it comes to dating while Black in the DMV! </p>
<h2>Why support independent productions?</h2>
<p>We get it. You have bills. You have hobbies. You have things you want and need to spend money on, and while you'd love to support other people's projects, it's just not at the forefront of your mind. We've been there too. But when you support independent projects led by women and people of color, you're supporting an era of film and television production that puts the audience in control of what they see, where they see it, and how they're represented in the mainstream. You're saying that these stories and these experiences have value and can resonate with anyone.</p>
<p>You've heard the statistics. But just to jog your memory:</p>
<p>A 2014 study by PBS showed that roughly one quarter of actors in mainstream films were people of color.</p>
<p>According to the Sundance Institute and Women in Film, ""across the 1,300 top-grossing films from 2002 to 2014, only 4.1 percent of all directors were female"".</p>
<p>Of 600 films studied by the Annenberg Center for Communication and Journalism, Black directors make up only 6%, with only two Black women directors on that list. </p>
<p>With those kinds of numbers, it’s no wonder we're out here trying to make this series on our own. Without the backing of big networks and studios, making a quality production is virtually impossible-- unless there's support from backers like you. </p>
<h2>How we'll spend money</h2>
<p>Your support will help us to finish production and post production which are extremely expensive. While we've already started to shoot the project, there's still more to be done. In addition to production, we'll need to edit, do color correction, sound mixing, marketing, and hold screeners. Without your backing, this project is nothing more than a cool idea that gets lost in the world of old Youtube videos no one will ever see.</p>
<h2>What's in it for you?</h2>
<p>While this is an independent production, we want supporters to know how much they're appreciated. We want to see you at the premiere and see your name in lights. Check out all of the great perks we offer. We hope these gestures of appreciation get you excited and feeling like you're part of this special project— because you are!</p>
<h2>How we got here</h2>
<p>Black Girl Single is the brainchild of Ashley Gordon, a filmmaker based in Washington, DC. As a DMV native and thirty-something single, Ashley has some stories! After years of dating in one of the country's most popular ""chocolate"" cities, Ashley admits to having a host of comical and frustrating dating experiences. After much urging from friends and family to see her turn these stories into a film, Ashley chose to take their advice and write the Black Girl Single series. She hopes the series makes singles, female and male, laugh, relate, and rethink their approach to dating and finding love. </p>

<p>- Acteur depuis de nombreuses années, Brennan a été intéressé par le rôle de réalisateur alors qu’il était toujours choisi pour jouer les mêmes rôles.</p>
<p>- Les 5 dernières années il a été réalisateur dont certains qui ont reçu des récompenses à de nombreux festivals comme :</p>

<p><strong>Florian François</strong></p>
<p>- Une valeur sûre de la scène d’improvisation de Toronto et un acteur accompli à part entière. L’écriture de « Rencontre » a été son premier scénario, son deuxième scénario est « Glove me Tender » en tant que réalisateur, tourné avec Brennan dans le rôle de directeur de la photographie et monteur.

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Who's making the show?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Brennan Martin</strong></p>
<p>- An actor for many years, Brennan got interested in Directing when he was always being cast as the same old thing. He's been directing for the last five years, and his films have won awards at many festivals including <u>TapFest</u> (""Rencontre"", Best Picture, Actress, Actor), <u>48 hour film project Toronto</u> (""Expiry Date"" [2015] Audience Choice Award, Best Cast), <u>Digi60</u> (""Ignite""[2014] Best actor) (""Last Impression"" [2015] Best Actor, Best Cast), <u>Actra's 24 hour film challenge</u> ( ""The Talk"" [2016] Winner, ""Actor @ Actra"" [2017] Winner) <u>KinoTO</u>  (""Good to see You"" [2017] Audience choice award)  among others. </p>
<p>- Brennan also is a Director of Photography, and has shot most of his own projects, and those of others like the pilot for the sit-com ""Quota"" made by the creators of ""The Beaverton"" and ""Second Jen"" (He was also the editor on that project). </p>
<p><strong>Florian François</strong></p>
<p>- A staple of the Toronto Improv scene and an accomplished actor in his own right, Rencontre was his first script to be produced, his second script ""Glove me Tender"" he directed, and shot with Brennan as his DOP and Editor, they both tied for the Audience Choice award at the KinoTO Film Fest in the Spring of 2017, Florian's film ""Glove me Tender"", and Brennan's Film ""Good to see You"". </p>
<h3>De quoi nous avons besoin</h3>
<p>Pourquoi avons-nous besoin de cet argent si Bell est notre distributeur ?</p>
<p>- Nous avons beaucoup de chance d’avoir Bell en tant que distributeur, mais leur financement est faible. Nous avons décidé d’engager des acteurs de l’union pour être sur d’avoir les meilleures performances. C’est pour cela que nous recherchons plus de financement, être dans la capacité de rémunérer des acteurs de qualité. Nous devons également payer l’équipe de tournage, la location, l’assurance, la restauration durant le tournage, l’équipement, etc. etc. etc. pour chaque contribution financière la série s’améliore.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Why do we need this money if Bell is distributing?</p>
<p>-We're very lucky that Bell decided to be our distributor, but their funding is very low, we've decided to hire union actors to make sure that this show is well acted, so we're looking to get a bit more money to make sure we can pay them, while making a great show. We also need to pay for crew, locations, insurance, food, post, equipment, etc. etc. etc. for every dollar that you contribute the show gets that much better. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Pourquoi voulons-nous faire Rencontres ?</h3>
<p>Rencontres la série promouvoit Toronto comme une ville Francophone et présentera des histoires francophones, nous voulons que Rencontres soit montré à une audience internationale.</p>
<p>- 300,000 francophones vivent à Toronto, la série Rencontres veut raconter leur histoire par la vision d’un voyager étranger. Nos épisodes vont explorer ce que c’est d’être Français et gay à Toronto dans les années 80, une histoire d’immigrant, des histoires d’Aborigènes, des histoires de la perte et des histoires à propos de la découverte d’une ville aussi multiculturelle que Toronto. Cette série raconte l’histoire Canadienne, et nous voulons retranscrire cela au mieux.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why do we want to make Rencontres?</h3>
<p>Rencontres The Series will promote Toronto as a francophone city, and showcase francophone stories, we want Rencontres to be shown to a Global audience. </p>
<p>- 300,000 francophones live in Toronto, what Rencontres wants to do is try and tell their stories through an outsider's perspective. Our episodes will explore what it was like to be French and gay in Toronto in the 80's, immigrant stories, Aboriginal stories, stories about loss and stories about finding new lives in the multicultural soup that is Toronto. This show tells Canadian stories, and we want this show to be great. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risques et Défis</h3>
<p>Comment allez-vous réaliser une série entière ?</p>
<p>- Créer une série est un défie. Heureusement notre équipe est expérimentée dans l’écriture, la production, le tournage et le montage de film. Donc vous pouvez être confiant sur la tenue des objectifs.</p>
<p>- L’écriture du scénario étant déjà fini, une grande partie du casting est déjà signée, en ce moment les lieux et le financement sont les principaux objectifs.</p>
<p>- Nos acteurs sont des professionnels formés, qui arriveront à l’heure en connaissant leur texte et prêt à tourné chaque jour.</p>
<p>- Faire le storyboard de l’intégralité de la série et tourner de façon « run and gun » permettra à la série de garder un rythme rapide et frai.</p>
<p>Brennan, notre réalisateur à beaucoup d’expérience avec des courts-métrages à défi, ayant gagné de nombreuses fois (gagnant de Actra 24 hours challenge deux ans de suite et gagnant de 48 hour film project Toronto’s Audience award en 2016 (le plus grand challenge en son genre au Canada) et gagnant à de multiples reprises au 72 hour film challenges au fil des années). <br/><br/>Ces défis consistent, une fois le scénario écrit, de tourner et monter le film dans un temps limité. Heureusement, le scénario est prêt, les emplacements et les acteurs seront également préparés et programmer et le temps que nous avons pour monter la série fait de ce challenge un réel bonheur.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>How are you going to shoot an entire show? </p>
<p>-Creating a show is a challenge. Luckily our team has a ton of experience writing, producing, directing, shooting, and editing films. So getting this all done on time is a foregone conclusion. </p>
<p>-Our scripts are all finished, we have a lot of the cast already signed on to shoot, right now locations and funding are the main focuses. </p>
<p>-Our actors are professionals. Our actors are well trained professional actors who will show up on time, lines memorized, and ready to shoot each day. </p>
<p>-Storyboarding the whole show, and shooting in an indie run and gun way will keep the show quick and fresh. Brennan, our director has a ton of experience with short film challenges, having won numerous times (winning the Actra 24 hour challenge two years in a row, winning the 48 hour film project Toronto's Audience award in 2016 {the largest film challenge of it's kind in Canada}, and winning at multiple 72 hour film challenges over the years). These challenges are when you have to script, shoot, and edit your film in the time limit. Luckily the scripts are all ready, the locations and actors will be rehearsed and scheduled, and the time we have for editing the series would make film challenge editors cry with joy. </p>

- Nous avons beaucoup de chance d’avoir Bell en tant que distributeur, mais leur financement est faible. Nous avons décidé d’engager des acteurs de l’union pour être sur d’avoir les meilleures performances. C’est pour cela que nous recherchons plus de financement, être dans la capacité de rémunérer des acteurs de qualité. Nous devons également payer l’équipe de tournage, la location, l’assurance, la restauration durant le tournage, l’équipement, etc. etc. etc. pour chaque contribution financière la série s’améliore.
 

What We Need 
Why do we need this money if Bell is distributing?
-We're very lucky that Bell decided to be our distributor, but their funding is very low, we've decided to hire union actors to make sure that this show is well acted, so we're looking to get a bit more money to make sure we can pay them, while making a great show. We also need to pay for crew, locations, insurance, food, post, equipment, etc. etc. etc. for every dollar that you contribute the show gets that much better. 
 
Pourquoi voulons-nous faire Rencontres ?
Rencontres la série promouvoit Toronto comme une ville Francophone et présentera des histoires francophones, nous voulons que Rencontres soit montré à une audience internationale.
- 300,000 francophones vivent à Toronto, la série Rencontres veut raconter leur histoire par la vision d’un voyager étranger. Nos épisodes vont explorer ce que c’est d’être Français et gay à Toronto dans les années 80, une histoire d’immigrant, des histoires d’Aborigènes, des histoires de la perte et des histoires à propos de la découverte d’une ville aussi multiculturelle que Toronto. Cette série raconte l’histoire Canadienne, et nous voulons retranscrire cela au mieux.
 

Why do we want to make Rencontres?
Rencontres The Series will promote Toronto as a francophone city, and showcase francophone stories, we want Rencontres to be shown to a Global audience. 
- 300,000 francophones live in Toronto, what Rencontres wants to do is try and tell their stories through an outsider's perspective. Our episodes will explore what it was like to be French and gay in Toronto in the 80's, immigrant stories, Aboriginal stories, stories about loss and stories about finding new lives in the multicultural soup that is Toronto. This show tells Canadian stories, and we want this show to be great. 
 
Risques et Défis
Comment allez-vous réaliser une série entière ?
- Créer une série est un défie. Heureusement notre équipe est expérimentée dans l’écriture, la production, le tournage et le montage de film. Donc vous pouvez être confiant sur la tenue des objectifs.
- L’écriture du scénario étant déjà fini, une grande partie du casting est déjà signée, en ce moment les lieux et le financement sont les principaux objectifs.
- Nos acteurs sont des professionnels formés, qui arriveront à l’heure en connaissant leur texte et prêt à tourné chaque jour.
- Faire le storyboard de l’intégralité de la série et tourner de façon « run and gun » permettra à la série de garder un rythme rapide et frai.
Brennan, notre réalisateur à beaucoup d’expérience avec des courts-métrages à défi, ayant gagné de nombreuses fois (gagnant de Actra 24 hours challenge deux ans de suite et gagnant de 48 hour film project Toronto’s Audience award en 2016 (le plus grand challenge en son genre au Canada) et gagnant à de multiples reprises au 72 hour film challenges au fil des années). Ces défis consistent, une fois le scénario écrit, de tourner et monter le film dans un temps limité. Heureusement, le scénario est prêt, les emplacements et les acteurs seront également préparés et programmer et le temps que nous avons pour monter la série fait de ce challenge un réel bonheur.
 

Risks & Challenges
How are you going to shoot an entire show? 
-Creating a show is a challenge. Luckily our team has a ton of experience writing, producing, directing, shooting, and editing films. So getting this all done on time is a foregone conclusion. 
-Our scripts are all finished, we have a lot of the cast already signed on to shoot, right now locations and funding are the main focuses. 
-Our actors are professionals. Our actors are well trained professional actors who will show up on time, lines memorized, and ready to shoot each day. 
-Storyboarding the whole show, and shooting in an indie run and gun way will keep the show quick and fresh. Brennan, our director has a ton of experience with short film challenges, having won numerous times (winning the Actra 24 hour challenge two years in a row, winning the 48 hour film project Toronto's Audience award in 2016 {the largest film challenge of it's kind in Canada}, and winning at multiple 72 hour film challenges over the years). These challenges are when you have to script, shoot, and edit your film in the time limit. Luckily the scripts are all ready, the locations and actors will be rehearsed and scheduled, and the time we have for editing the series would make film challenge editors cry with joy.

It truly is a surreal moment that has forced me to ask: how did we get here? </p><p>My name is Tyler Jacob Stevens and I’m the Showrunner and Co-Creator of Majestic 8, an NYU Advanced TV Pilot. I’ve spent the last few years at NYU lucky enough to be doing exactly what I love: writing, directing, and producing films with the most talented young filmmakers in the world. In early 2018, I sat down with my close friend and roommate Spencer Nachman to talk about a script a script about a few teenagers, a rundown movie theater, and their experiences coming of age in the late 2000s. </p><p>We titled it MAJESTIC 8, our personal tribute to the movie theaters we grew up in and the unsung heroes that keep the popcorn popping and films showing. We pitched the script for NYU’s Advanced TV Program and were given the incredible opportunity to produce the pilot of MAJESTIC 8 as one of two 30-minute pilots being produced at Tisch this Fall. </p><p>The most rewarding part of this process has been watching a team of friends and filmmakers, people I’m proud to call collaborators, come together over the last six month and work hard   on MAJESTIC 8, preparing to shoot in November. We’ve assembled a terrific team of artists that I couldn’t be more excited to work with. So while pre-production continues and we get closer and closer to bringing Majestic Theatres to life, we figured it was time to introduce MAJESTIC 8 to the world.</p><p>With your help and generous donations, we’ll be able to make MAJESTIC 8 the show we know it can be: an offbeat and cinematic ode to the people who make the movies happen for us, one tub of popcorn at all time.</p><p><i>Tyler Jacob Stevens (Showrunner/Co-Creator/Writer)</i></p><h3>WHAT IS MAJESTIC 8?</h3><p>MAJESTIC 8 is a TV show set in a movie theater. Taking place in the suburbs of Orlando, Florida in early 2008, it’s a love letter to the theatrical experience and the dying art of film projection set in a pre-recession era. It’s a coming-of-age comedy that follows BRANDON, a recently-suspended high school student in desperate need of a job, as he stumbles into employment at the local eight-screen branch of the nationwide Majestic Theatres Corporation, better known as the MAJESTIC 8.</p><p>At the MAJESTIC 8, Brandon is drawn into a strange world populated by eccentric new co-workers. There’s KEITH, the sleazy, semi-tyrannical General Manager who gives Brandon the job; there’s MICKEY, the high school senior longing to leave Orlando and find purpose on the West Coast; there’s PJ, who spends his time on the clock at the Majestic daydreaming about becoming the next Tarantino… or Michael Bay… or whatever hyperviolent male director he happens to be obsessed with at the moment; and finally, there’s SHAWN and GREGORY, the only two who ever seem to take their jobs seriously.</p><p>Over the course of his first day, Brandon adjusts to the unique way of life at the MAJESTIC 8, facing strange guests, making new friends, and finding a path forward for himself where he didn’t see one before.</p><h3>MEET THE CREW!</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570312820/r7hfvcdgn8tpx1g3ahc1.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>TYLER JACOB STEVENS</strong> - Showrunner/Co-Creator/Writer</p><p>Tyler Jacob Stevens was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, which led him to flee to the East Coast for college and subsequently led him to NYU, where he’s written, directed, and produced short films that brought him together with the Majestic 8 team.

It truly is a surreal moment that has forced me to ask: how did we get here? My name is Tyler Jacob Stevens and I’m the Showrunner and Co-Creator of Majestic 8, an NYU Advanced TV Pilot. I’ve spent the last few years at NYU lucky enough to be doing exactly what I love: writing, directing, and producing films with the most talented young filmmakers in the world. In early 2018, I sat down with my close friend and roommate Spencer Nachman to talk about a script a script about a few teenagers, a rundown movie theater, and their experiences coming of age in the late 2000s. We titled it MAJESTIC 8, our personal tribute to the movie theaters we grew up in and the unsung heroes that keep the popcorn popping and films showing. We pitched the script for NYU’s Advanced TV Program and were given the incredible opportunity to produce the pilot of MAJESTIC 8 as one of two 30-minute pilots being produced at Tisch this Fall. The most rewarding part of this process has been watching a team of friends and filmmakers, people I’m proud to call collaborators, come together over the last six month and work hard   on MAJESTIC 8, preparing to shoot in November. We’ve assembled a terrific team of artists that I couldn’t be more excited to work with. So while pre-production continues and we get closer and closer to bringing Majestic Theatres to life, we figured it was time to introduce MAJESTIC 8 to the world.With your help and generous donations, we’ll be able to make MAJESTIC 8 the show we know it can be: an offbeat and cinematic ode to the people who make the movies happen for us, one tub of popcorn at all time.Tyler Jacob Stevens (Showrunner/Co-Creator/Writer)WHAT IS MAJESTIC 8?MAJESTIC 8 is a TV show set in a movie theater. Taking place in the suburbs of Orlando, Florida in early 2008, it’s a love letter to the theatrical experience and the dying art of film projection set in a pre-recession era. It’s a coming-of-age comedy that follows BRANDON, a recently-suspended high school student in desperate need of a job, as he stumbles into employment at the local eight-screen branch of the nationwide Majestic Theatres Corporation, better known as the MAJESTIC 8.At the MAJESTIC 8, Brandon is drawn into a strange world populated by eccentric new co-workers. There’s KEITH, the sleazy, semi-tyrannical General Manager who gives Brandon the job; there’s MICKEY, the high school senior longing to leave Orlando and find purpose on the West Coast; there’s PJ, who spends his time on the clock at the Majestic daydreaming about becoming the next Tarantino… or Michael Bay… or whatever hyperviolent male director he happens to be obsessed with at the moment; and finally, there’s SHAWN and GREGORY, the only two who ever seem to take their jobs seriously.Over the course of his first day, Brandon adjusts to the unique way of life at the MAJESTIC 8, facing strange guests, making new friends, and finding a path forward for himself where he didn’t see one before.MEET THE CREW!TYLER JACOB STEVENS - Showrunner/Co-Creator/WriterTyler Jacob Stevens was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, which led him to flee to the East Coast for college and subsequently led him to NYU, where he’s written, directed, and produced short films that brought him together with the Majestic 8 team. At the same time throughout college, he has interned at Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Allison Shearmur Productions, and Untitled Entertainment. He’s tremendously honored and humbled that MAJESTIC 8 was chosen to be produced at NYU and couldn’t be more excited that he gets to work with this wildly talented group of close friends and collaborators for his final thesis project.SPENCER NACHMAN - Co-Creator/WriterSpencer Nachman is a recent graduate of NYU’s Cinema Studies program and currently works in New York as an agent’s assistant at Buchwald. He’s also held a number of internships focused on film and television development. Before moving to the big city, Spencer was a staff member at a Regal movie theater in his hometown of Jacksonville, Florida — a theater not unlike the Majestic 8. He’s excited and honored to be able to bring some of these experiences to life with the help of an amazing team of creators.ADAM ROAT - DirectorAdam Roat is a senior at NYU studying Film and TV. After falling in love with all things cinema at the age of 10, he soon discovered the creative side of filmmaking and hasn't stopped since. Over the years he has won several awards for his writing and directing and his work has played at film festivals across the country, including a 30 minute movie musical he directed, which premiered at the Montclair Film Festival. He is honored to be a part of the Majestic 8 team and cannot wait for you to see it!JOHN HOLLANDS - Executive ProducerJohn Hollands is a Senior at NYU Tisch studying Film & TV. Hailing from Vancouver BC, John has produced numerous student shorts during his time at NYU while developing his own films. Previously, John worked to help develop and produce work with Khare Communications, a leading Canadian corporate documentary company. JULIA YELVINGTON - Director of PhotographyJulia Yelvington is a Brooklyn based DP, Documentarian, and Activist who first worked with Tyler and John on a previous project in November of 2018 and is very excited to be back with the team! Originally from Boulder, CO, Julia has experience working on large-scale commercial and Fashion projects with Rosco Production, as well as being Head of Visuals for NYC based accessories brand Susan Alexandra. She is excited to tackle the big new world of Television!GRIFFIN CUBERO - Production DesignerGriffin Cubero is a Senior at NYU Tisch studying Film and Television. When she first began working on set, she found a home with the art department and soon began seeking opportunities out. She’s worked as an art assistant on multiple independent film projects and is now working to build her portfolio as a Production Designer on student sets, short films, and music videos.ELLIOT FARINARO - Editor/ProducerElliot Farinaro, born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, is a senior at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. During his time in New York, he has edited over twenty students films, done freelance editing for various companies such as Def Jam Recordings and HUMAN, has had his work featured in publishing outlets like Forbes, Teen Vogue, and Director’s Note, and just this past summer he cut his first feature film. Currently, Elliot is interning at Final Cut Edit. He is thrilled to be a part of the Majestic 8 crew, and cannot wait to help bring the team’s vision to life.Other insanely talented, amazing people included on this journey toward, throughout, and past production are...CLAUDIA ROSE - Art DirectorDANNY ROBERTS - Sound MixerCHASE NEWMAN - ProducerTUNC SARDAN - ProducerLAINE ELLIOTT - Costume DesignerSARAH NOCQUET - First Assistant DirectorYOUR DONATION WILL HELP…A lot like going to the movies nowadays, filmmaking can be quite an expensive endeavor (except just on a much, much larger, more costly scale).

<p>The great thing about camping is that camping is not a destination, it’s not just something you do.  Camping is a frame of mind, a feeling, it’s getting to spend time with your family without life’s stressful distractions. Sitting around a blazing campfire with a group of friends, laughing the night away, and reminiscing about days gone past. Camping is defined without boundaries: It knows no gender, belief or personal view.  Camping is something that is for EVERYONE, anywhere, any time! Around the Campfire, everyone is in love with nature!</p>

Each episode is told from the point of view of a different character at The Pointe.In the pilot, we see Pointe Bay through the eyes of Ryan Blake, the town’s teen alcoholic and all-American misfit who makes too many crude jokes and takes way too much Adderall. When Ryan learns that Krish is stuck working there for the summer because he took a bat to his ex-girlfriend’s car, Ryan takes a liking to Krish – and Krish takes a liking to Ryan’s older sister, Sam Blake. With a knack for inviting trouble, the two piss off their boss/Sam’s boyfriend/the mayor’s son, Jason Reynolds, when they crash Jason’s summer kickoff party.The Pointe uses laughter and storytelling from multiple points of view to explore the universal problems of race in America, gossipy small towns, loneliness, friendship, judgment, and acceptance. By the end of the pilot, you’ll be left with a sore belly and a hunger to see what the other characters think of the infamous Krish.Thanks to the incredible support we received in our last crowdfunding campaign, The Pointe’s Pilot episode is in post-production! Now that we’ve brought the story of The Pointe to the screen, we need YOUR help to share this story with the world!We need your support, whether it be a donation of money, time, or a post on social media. Join our team and help us spread the word. For your contributions, you will receive our eternal thanks, some unique perks, and the opportunity to be a part of something special. You can say you knew us before we were cool, and we’ll be sure to remember you when we’re famous! If you can donate even $1, or share our campaign on Facebook or Instagram, it will really help The Pointe get to the next step.Your contributions allow us to afford:-Post-production voiceovers and ADR (so that we sound as good as we look)-Editing (so we can bring everything together)-Color Correction (to help get those ocean blues just right)-Scoring and sound design (because The Pointe's intro will be your new favorite song)-Film & pitching festivals (because you miss 100% of the shots you don't take)-Pitches to streaming services (so you can watch The Pointe on your favorite streaming service)-Pitches to larger TV networks (so the entire nation can see The Pointe)-Feedback on our pitch and pilot from industry professionals (to help us break into the room where it happens)-Marketing for The Pointe (so we can connect with more people like you!)The Pointe allows us to touch upon many problems our country is facing today. Some of us are Ryan Blake – stuck in a small town, struggling to keep things fresh and worthwhile. Some of us are Jason, a big fish in a small pond with big aspirations. And some of us are Krish, the outsider just trying to fit in.Krish comes to The Pointe like an immigrant coming to America, and as many immigrants do, he makes The Pointe better with his unique life experience. At times, the inhabitants of The Pointe fail to see that. But Krish teaches our quirky cast of characters about his culture, learning to question his own judgments in the process.By supporting The Pointe, you’re supporting independent filmmakers – and it’s not just about us. You’re showing Hollywood that diverse stories are important, valuable, and have an audience. You're showing the world that ALL points of view are important – both traditional and nontraditional. You’re helping us tell a story that we rarely get to see, one that reveals the underlying racial tension in rural areas – and has a few laughs, to boot.With your help, we can share The Pointe with the world.It’s tough to pitch a pilot in today’s TV world, but we are confident that The Pointe is a show worth watching. With your help, we can get our story out there and make audiences laugh until it hurts. Without your help, no matter how incredible the pilot is, our story won’t be heard.We’ve put in countless hours over the idea, the script, and the final product.

<p>ABOUT ME AND MYTHOS </p>
<p>When people ask me where I’m from, I often hesitate to answer. That’s because I was born and raised in Venezuela and my family is from Syria. I haven’t been back home in 12 years. To be completely honest, I’m not sure what’s like to live there anymore. What is home? Is it a place? Is it a person? Is it a memory?  Similar to myself, the characters in the world of Mythos are going have to figure out what is home for them.</p>
<p>Mythos is an hour-long fantasy drama about a demigod who teams up with three Greek gods who are banished to our world and struggle with identity crisis as they lose the very thing that makes them gods—their immortality. Together, they will realize that they are humanity’s last hope to survive the apocalypse.</p>
<p>HOW YOU CAN JOIN THIS ADVENTURE </p>
<p>MYTHOS is a story I feel very strongly about. I’m extremely excited to shoot and share it with you, and I’m giving my 100% to make sure it will come out in its best shape and form. </p>
<p>And you can help me make sure it will find its audience. Because ultimately, the greatest story in the world only exists when it's experienced by others. </p>
<p>It should go without saying that filmmaking is expensive, so to be able to bring on board the people and locations that will expand our MYTHOS universe, we need some help. </p>
<p>We need $20,000 to complete production for Mythos. Your donation will go toward:</p>
<p>-Crew and Equipment</p>
<p>-Insurance</p>
<p>-Transportation</p>
<p>-Location Rentals </p>
<p>-Food</p>
<p>-Set Design</p>
<p>-Wardrobe &amp; Props </p>
<p>-BTS Photographer</p>
<p>Asking for a monetary donation is not something easy to do, nor do I take this task lightly, so before you hit the donate button, or even if you don't, I want to thank you for supporting this project.</p>
<p>I hope you’ll join me in this adventure and help me make a pilot I am convinced will offer a different take on the human experience and our current state of the world. </p>
<p>OTHER WAYS TO HELP</p>
<p>If you're unable to donate for whatever reason, but still want to help support MYTHOS, there's a few ways how you can help: </p>
<p>Send this campaign to your indie film-loving friends and family!  </p>
<p>Or donate in-kind services or skills:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm James Croteau, a film student based in Toronto with a passion for horror. I've always wanted to make movies, but more importantly, I wanted to make horror movies, like the ones I grew up loving. I believe that any film that can balance serious themes or dark imagery with a sense of excitement and humour is a remarkable accomplishment, and something that I strive to do myself. So after three years of film school where documentary and drama were prioritized, I've been given the freedom to finally make the kind of film that I want to make, a film that takes inspiration from the films that made me who I am today. </p>
<p><i>Strange Aeons </i>is the story of a detective in search of truth. After investigating a string of unexplainable disappearances, he journeys to the home of an eccentric professor who believes that an ancient cult worshipping an evil entity known as Azathoth may be responsible. Both visually and story-wise, the film is influenced by horror films of the 70's and 80's relying on bold, colourful lighting and exaggerated camera movement. </p>
<p>The film is also being made largely due to the hard work and dedication of my wonderful peers, fellow film students whose passion is second only to their talent behind the camera. We've got a killer crew and this wouldn't be possible without the help of my producers, director of photography, effects team and everyone else involved.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The film's budget is around $5500, a modest goal in comparison to other thesis films being made by my other fellow film students this year. </li>
<li>The money goes towards renting high-quality camera equipment, securing a shooting location via Set Scouter, providing Craft Services for those working on set, and transportation for the loads of props, gear and crew members.</li>
<li>The majority of the film's costs have been paid for out of pocket by us, so any funding will go towards getting that money back. Any additional funds not going towards the actual production will be used for promotion and to help us get the film into festivals. Additionally, it will help us to make some merchandize in the form of hats, t-shirts, buttons and posters, all of which will be available as perks to those who donate! </li>
<li>Lastly, once the film is completed, it will be available to view online to those who donate, and every supporter will get a special thanks in the film's credits.</li>
<br/>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This film is the culmination of four years of knowledge. Film school is extremely rewarding, and while it's often challenging, the chance to create something that we are passionate about is wonderful practice for what we all hope to call a career in the future. </p>
<p>Although I myself have written and directed projects in the past, this is the first time that I can do so on such a big scale. Many people are involved in the project and they are all looking to hone their skills and create something great, myself included. This film is by far the most important project most of us have ever been a part of so far.</p>
<p>The film itself deals with themes of hopelessness, fear of the unknown, and the grim possibility that the future may not be as bright as we once hoped. These themes, all of which are relatable for any student, will be presented in a cathartic way allowing us to not only deal with our existential worries but turn them into something tangible, something constructive and above all else, something entertaining. It is through entertainment and art that we can gain a better understanding of our fears and our lives. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Obviously in filmmaking, risks and challenges are plentiful. </p>
<ul>
<li>A large concern is not being able to get back the money already put into this project. As it is a student film, we make no profit. Without donations, we would all be in the hole a few thousand dollars, and with the school year coming to an end, student debts are creeping up on us faster each day. </li>
<li>The film is getting made either way, but its quality depends on our ability to problem solve. Equipment provided by our school may be faulty, lights could burn out, camera batteries could go dead in an instant, and noise complaints may be issued from neighbours to our set. In filmmaking, anything that can go wrong usually will go wrong and we're taking this into consideration by coming up with as many back up plans as we can.</li>
<li>Locations will not fall through which is great. They've been locked down. That being said, some exterior shots may be more difficult to get, given that they are being filmed at night on public roads. This leads to a plethora of potential issues, but as stated before, filmmakers come equipped with a skill set for problem solving in the moment. </li>
<li>The film may only be viewable online, as festivals are hard to get into. Doesn't mean we won't try though!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate, you can still help us out! Please feel free to spread the good word and help us reach as many people as possible!</p>

<h3>HOW IT BEGAN:</h3>
<p>I always had a passion for writing. I like to entertain people and I try to bring a smile to everyone I am surrounded by - it brings me joy every time I see someone smile or laugh. Just like thousands of other people, I am an immigrant in the United States. While juggling 2 jobs I am doing my best to make my dream come true as an Filmmaker/ Writer/Storyteller. In my journey from Nepal to South Africa to NYC, and now LA, I have so many stories to share. Recently, I started focusing more on writing so I could create content that will entertain people all around the world. </p>
<p>After working on my current project for 2 years, I was inspired  by the mockumentary style of The Office ( also my favorite show), which made me realize that I could tell my story in a new and more humorous way . Upon meeting Anna-Kate Blackford at work, we became friends and I learned that she has  a degree in writing from SCAD, and had prior experience working on multiple tv shows. Soon after reading my script,  she invited me to the LA SCAD Alumni and Friends Writing Group, where I got the opportunity to learn and grow alongside fellow writers who were on the same path.</p>
<p>With the help of the writing group I finally started this web series. I recently filmed the pilot, which is currently in post production. I will post a teaser soon, so you can get a taste of  what I plan to bring to the world in hopes that everyone will laugh their ass off!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED:</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $25,000 for  a 10 episode series. This also includes fees charged by Indiegogo. Besides those fees, here is how we plan to spend the money we raise:</p>
<p>- Equipment rentals</p>
<p>- Permits and Insurance</p>
<p>- Paying cast and crew (Actors, Director, DP, Sound, Makeup and more)</p>
<p>- Props and locations</p>
<p>- Craft services</p>
<p>- Post production</p>
<p>If we make our goal, and this series becomes a reality, we will use any surplus funds to make either a trailer or episode for the next season.</p>
<p>We understand and appreciate the value of every donation we receive, and we have some exciting rewards to thank you for your contribution.</p>
<h3>IMPACT:</h3>
<p>This project has been made possible by our team of fellow dreamers that hustle to make creative, engaging content - while still holding down a full time job. First and foremost, your role in making this series come to life helps all of us move closer to making our side hustle our new full time job. </p>
<p>In the years since I started writing my story, immigration has become a hot topic. Though it was not our goal initially, our series can help lessen the fear that surrounds people wanting to move to United States to follow their dreams.

</div></div>","HOW IT BEGAN:
I always had a passion for writing. I like to entertain people and I try to bring a smile to everyone I am surrounded by - it brings me joy every time I see someone smile or laugh. Just like thousands of other people, I am an immigrant in the United States. While juggling 2 jobs I am doing my best to make my dream come true as an Filmmaker/ Writer/Storyteller. In my journey from Nepal to South Africa to NYC, and now LA, I have so many stories to share. Recently, I started focusing more on writing so I could create content that will entertain people all around the world. 
After working on my current project for 2 years, I was inspired  by the mockumentary style of The Office ( also my favorite show), which made me realize that I could tell my story in a new and more humorous way . Upon meeting Anna-Kate Blackford at work, we became friends and I learned that she has  a degree in writing from SCAD, and had prior experience working on multiple tv shows. Soon after reading my script,  she invited me to the LA SCAD Alumni and Friends Writing Group, where I got the opportunity to learn and grow alongside fellow writers who were on the same path.
With the help of the writing group I finally started this web series. I recently filmed the pilot, which is currently in post production. I will post a teaser soon, so you can get a taste of  what I plan to bring to the world in hopes that everyone will laugh their ass off!

WHAT WE NEED:
We are looking to raise $25,000 for  a 10 episode series. This also includes fees charged by Indiegogo. Besides those fees, here is how we plan to spend the money we raise:
- Equipment rentals
- Permits and Insurance
- Paying cast and crew (Actors, Director, DP, Sound, Makeup and more)
- Props and locations
- Craft services
- Post production
If we make our goal, and this series becomes a reality, we will use any surplus funds to make either a trailer or episode for the next season.
We understand and appreciate the value of every donation we receive, and we have some exciting rewards to thank you for your contribution.
IMPACT:
This project has been made possible by our team of fellow dreamers that hustle to make creative, engaging content - while still holding down a full time job. First and foremost, your role in making this series come to life helps all of us move closer to making our side hustle our new full time job. 
In the years since I started writing my story, immigration has become a hot topic. Though it was not our goal initially, our series can help lessen the fear that surrounds people wanting to move to United States to follow their dreams. With greater understanding of the normal lives of these people, we hope we can bridge the gap with laughter and love.

<h3>A Note from the Creator</h3>
<p>As a storyteller and as a woman, I want to explore a character who has had to make sacrifices in her life she never expected, and finally at this point, after the dust has settled of raising a child and building a home realizes that maybe this isn’t the life she expected or wanted to live. Along the way she lost the power and agency she took for granted when she was younger. I started writing this script a year and a half ago as a feature treatment but found that long-form television was the medium that would bring Mary’s story to life.</p> <p>The pilot opens with Mary Yates on her 50th birthday at her weekly women’s club meeting. Surrounded by women her age in an opulent country club, it’s obvious that while Mary may be a member of this society she doesn’t exactly fit in. As we follow Mary through what is supposed to be a typical day in her life we catch her husband Sebastian cheating on her with none other than Christina Woods, the president of Mary’s women’s club. And to make matters worse, later that night Mary is kidnapped by a mob coming to finally collect Sebastian’s debt that he has kept secret from everyone in his life. Through these unexpected obstacles, we see Mary starting to regain a power she realized she had lost.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the approximate 300 films shot in NYU every semester, little to no emphasis is placed on sustainability. With the high scope of power, electricity and resources utilised in every shoot, each shoot leaves a significant carbon footprint. This project is a 30-minute television pilot, Mary and the Mob, produced in the Advanced Television Production class at Tisch Film, run by Assistant Arts Professor Harry Winer. The key crew of Mary and the Mob aims to implement a carbon neutral set, alongside reducing waste and reusing resources. Our goal is to become the benchmark for future productions, proving that sustainability is not only important, but also feasible.</p>

<h3>Character Breakdowns</h3>
<p><strong>MARY YATES (50)</strong>  - Series Lead. A housewife that could’ve been her husband’s boss if she hadn’t focused on supporting their daughter that’s now left the nest. Mary gets less and less satisfaction from her existence every day, as her social influence in the neighborhood wanes as well. She’s become used to being overlooked at the country club, but deep down yearns to take her power back.</p>
<p>When her husband’s infidelity and debts to the mob are revealed, this gives her the unexpected momentum to turn an accidental kidnapping into an exciting and illegal new line of business. Bossing around c-list goons turns out to be more similar to raising a child than you think.</p>
<p><br/><strong>SEBASTIAN YATES (Mid 50s)</strong> - Supporting role. Mary’s husband, who may have been a skilled businessman in his day, but nearing 60 what’s left of him is a cowardly and unfaithful shell of his former self who couldn’t remember his anniversary if it were his phone password.</p>
<p>Sebastian’s secret financial failings over the years have led to him resorting to Marco Woods’ Mafia family to prop up his business. Along with this web of lies, Sebastian has also been having over a year-long affair with Mary’s friend Christina, which she discovers on her birthday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HAILEY YATES (25)</strong> - Supporting role. Mary’s loving daughter that’s moved from their town to go to art school in New York city. She’s blossomed into her own person in New York, and finds going home tedious. She’s fearless and independent, and fierce towards people who’ll hurt her family and friends.</p>
<p>Hailey takes care of her mother after she kicks out Sebastian and really needs the help, but when she goes out on her own to find her when she goes missing, she gets sucked into the illegal activity that ensues.</p> <p><strong>CHRISTINA WOODS (Late 40s)</strong> - Supporting role. Christina is a younger-looking friend of Mary’s who’s twice as passive aggressive. She’s the newly crowned President of the Women’s Club and has slowly taken everything from Mary’s social standing to her husband from her. She’s shallow and rather image obsessed, wants absolute control in every situation, and holds her recovering addict son to a strict schedule.</p>
<p>She’s afraid of her mob boss husband, Marco, and when Mary gets in business with Marco, she has Christina under her thumb because of the dirt she has on her.</p> <p><strong>OWEN WOODS (24)</strong>  - Supporting role. Christina’s bumbling and self-destructive son that lives back home after several stints at rehab. He’s unable to stay on the straight-and-narrow, and despite how scared he is of his mom, he’s eager to get involved in his father Marco’s criminal enterprise.</p>
<p>Owen’s one of the two low-level goons that botches the hit on Sebastian and kidnaps Mary instead. He’s quick to get the group in over their heads and is hardly capable at helping as the stakes rise.</p> <p><strong>RALPH (Mid 20s)</strong> - Supporting role. While he may be more experienced than his associate Owen in the organized crime game, Ralph is just as stupid and much more interested in hanging out with his girlfriend at any given time.</p> <p><strong>PETE WOODS (Late 30s) </strong>- Supporting role. Pete is the mid-level mob boss overseeing the botched kidnapping operation, and is not even fully prepared to be in charge of the minor stake of the mob business in his name. He’s good at threats and putting on a tough face, but doesn’t have the backbone or leadership skill to climb the ladder and step out of his brother’s shadow.</p>
<p>He’s jealous of his brother Marco’s more natural talent in organized crime world, and his attempts to prove himself only put the family business in further jeopardy. He slowly loses his position in the mob to Mary as they start working together to track down Sebastian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>MARCO WOODS (Late 50s)</strong> - Supporting Role. The powerful and ruthless boss of the local Mafia that intimidates anyone he crosses. His reputation for violence and brutal protection of his territory precedes him  around the whole New York Tri-State area, so he has little patience for the failings of his underlings in dealing with Sebastian’s debts. Marco hates mixing family with business.</p>

Many families (including theirs!) searched for a way to continue planting the seeds of faith in their children. In fact, continuing their young daughter’s faith formation was the motivation for starting this ministry!</p><h3>How Our Ministry Has Grown</h3><p>What started out as a temporary Children’s Liturgy of the Word series for their parish instantly grew into a program watched by thousands of families from all over the world. Viewers from 6 continents have fervently shared how the weekly Kids' Liturgy YouTube videos have helped their little ones understand God’s Word and grow in faith. So many parents and DREs have noted how this program has been a lifeline during this challenging year. In April of 2020, the program was picked up by the CatholicTV Network, with the first televised episode airing on Easter Sunday. </p><p>With family-friendly religious music by world-renowned Catholic composer John Burland, faith-based signs in American Sign Language, and abundant imagery to help bring Sacred Scripture to life, their videos encourage children to actively participate in the liturgy. Pflaum Publishing Group, a leading Catholic Publisher, graciously provided their wonderful Children’s Celebrate Leader’s Guide as a resource to help Miss Heidi convey the truths of the Catholic faith to young viewers.</p><p>Miss Heidi also began designing a free downloadable coloring page to correlate with each Sunday’s Gospel reading. Children can submit their artwork to be aired at the end of a future episode. This allows children to more actively participate in the mission of evangelization--they, too, can help spread the Good News through their art! In recent months, Kids’ Liturgy has received over 250 coloring pages per week from children around the globe! </p><h3>What's Next</h3><p>Heidi and Mark give thanks to God for leading them to this ministry, which has enriched their lives in so many ways! However, making these weekly episodes has been one of the greatest challenges of their lives. Both Mark and Heidi have spent countless late nights scripting, filming, producing, and editing Children’s Liturgy videos (after their children have gone to bed and after their full-time work and home responsibilities). </p><p>After much prayer and discernment, Mark and Heidi feel called to continue producing Children’s Liturgy of the Word episodes as well as other catechetical programming, and they are doing everything in their power to make this calling their full-time jobs. They have big aspirations of reaching more families, parishes, and Catholic schools around the world to help supplement early childhood catechesis, encourage a deeper understanding of Sacred Scripture, serve as a way for parents to become more involved in their children’s faith journey, and strengthen the faith of our little ones--who are the future of the Church! </p><h3>How You Can Help</h3><p>By helping Heidi and Mark reach their campaign goal with a one-time donation, you can ensure another year of Kids' Liturgy programming, including more free episodes of Children’s Liturgy of the Word! They would be humbled by any level of support. Please consider donating any amount (click “Back It” to begin) to help their fundraising efforts. If you are not able to help financially, you can also support us by spreading the word about our Kids’ Liturgy ministry with your diocese, parish, parish school, family, and friends. The Wittes would be very grateful for your prayers, as well! God bless you for considering becoming a supporter of Kids’ Liturgy Video Ministry!</p><p>**Please note: Kids’ Liturgy, LLC is not a non-profit company. Donations are not tax-deductible. If we are unable to reach our goal, programming may be limited.**</p><p> </p><h3>About the Producers of Kids’ Liturgy:</h3><p> </p><p>Heidi Witte--also known as Miss Heidi-- is an alumnus of the University of Notre Dame ('09) and also holds an M.Ed. in Elementary Education from the Alliance for Catholic Education program at Notre Dame.

Many families (including theirs!) searched for a way to continue planting the seeds of faith in their children. In fact, continuing their young daughter’s faith formation was the motivation for starting this ministry!How Our Ministry Has GrownWhat started out as a temporary Children’s Liturgy of the Word series for their parish instantly grew into a program watched by thousands of families from all over the world. Viewers from 6 continents have fervently shared how the weekly Kids' Liturgy YouTube videos have helped their little ones understand God’s Word and grow in faith. So many parents and DREs have noted how this program has been a lifeline during this challenging year. In April of 2020, the program was picked up by the CatholicTV Network, with the first televised episode airing on Easter Sunday. With family-friendly religious music by world-renowned Catholic composer John Burland, faith-based signs in American Sign Language, and abundant imagery to help bring Sacred Scripture to life, their videos encourage children to actively participate in the liturgy. Pflaum Publishing Group, a leading Catholic Publisher, graciously provided their wonderful Children’s Celebrate Leader’s Guide as a resource to help Miss Heidi convey the truths of the Catholic faith to young viewers.Miss Heidi also began designing a free downloadable coloring page to correlate with each Sunday’s Gospel reading. Children can submit their artwork to be aired at the end of a future episode. This allows children to more actively participate in the mission of evangelization--they, too, can help spread the Good News through their art! In recent months, Kids’ Liturgy has received over 250 coloring pages per week from children around the globe! What's NextHeidi and Mark give thanks to God for leading them to this ministry, which has enriched their lives in so many ways! However, making these weekly episodes has been one of the greatest challenges of their lives. Both Mark and Heidi have spent countless late nights scripting, filming, producing, and editing Children’s Liturgy videos (after their children have gone to bed and after their full-time work and home responsibilities). After much prayer and discernment, Mark and Heidi feel called to continue producing Children’s Liturgy of the Word episodes as well as other catechetical programming, and they are doing everything in their power to make this calling their full-time jobs. They have big aspirations of reaching more families, parishes, and Catholic schools around the world to help supplement early childhood catechesis, encourage a deeper understanding of Sacred Scripture, serve as a way for parents to become more involved in their children’s faith journey, and strengthen the faith of our little ones--who are the future of the Church! How You Can HelpBy helping Heidi and Mark reach their campaign goal with a one-time donation, you can ensure another year of Kids' Liturgy programming, including more free episodes of Children’s Liturgy of the Word! They would be humbled by any level of support. Please consider donating any amount (click “Back It” to begin) to help their fundraising efforts. If you are not able to help financially, you can also support us by spreading the word about our Kids’ Liturgy ministry with your diocese, parish, parish school, family, and friends. The Wittes would be very grateful for your prayers, as well! God bless you for considering becoming a supporter of Kids’ Liturgy Video Ministry!**Please note: Kids’ Liturgy, LLC is not a non-profit company. Donations are not tax-deductible.

<h3>What is The V.V. Vlog?</h3>
<p>The V.V. Vlog is a satirical web series that tackles the new forms of pressure that the contemporary media put on women. </p>
<p>It is shot in the form of a YouTube-Channel spoof, and follows model-turned-activist Valentina Valentino educating her followers on social issues and latest trends.</p>
</div><div>
<p>In our pilot-webisode ""You are What You Eat"" Valentina educates her followers on how to cope with beauty standards promoted by social media.                                                                                                  With your help we can raise enough money to shoot two more webisodes: ""How to be a Feminist""- which sheds a light on 'Femvertising and how multinationals use women empowerment as a cover to Pay Gap, and ""#RelationshipGoals"" which is the ultimate guide to get a stylish, non toxic boyfriend. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Body image, lifestyle, relationship status, social behaviour, are often cause of judgment against women; and even in a time where it seems like women are finally given a chance to speak up, it is good to wonder how much of that “freedom” is piloted by the media and multinational corporations.</p>
<p>We believe it's important to make The V.V. Vlog to keep up the conversation about women emancipation, to shed a light on how social media expect us to live up to unattainable standards, and finally to do all of the above while having a laugh.</p>

<h3>What is Illusional?</h3>
<p> “Illusional” follows the story of Dara Elliot and Tanner Poplar, two young aspiring actors who move to Los Angeles feeling ready to take on the world *and* take it by storm. Both very imaginative and optimistic individuals, the duo learns quickly that the world they imagined and the world they end up in are in fact two very different places. As a non-binary LGBT actor and a six foot tall black actress, they don’t exactly fit the molds of “traditional” stars, but they aren’t about to let that stop them! Between navigating the trials and tribulations of adulthood and managing the expectations born from their unique worldviews, they begin to learn what it truly takes to make their mark on the world.</p>
<p> But what does it really take to thrive in today’s world for two young millennials fresh out of college with nothing but a dream (and active imaginations) at their disposal? Between learning how to be “real adults” and not getting kicked out of their apartment, seeking friendships and relationships that aren’t awful, and figuring out how, exactly, someone just starts acting, season 1 of “Illusional” will see Dara and Tanner navigating survival jobs, searching for love, and learning what it really takes to be seen as serious actors in Los Angeles: from their first Groupon acting class to their very first professional auditions!</p>
<p>Season 1 will see our heroes:</p>
<ul>
<li>confronting the issues they face as people who exist outside of the norm</li>
<li>blackness and the struggles that come along with being a tall woman</li>
<li>non-binary, LGBT identity</li>
<li>learning how to be ""real adults""</li>
<li>not getting kicked out of their apartment</li>
<li>seeking meaningful friendships</li>
<li>finding love! (sigh)</li>
<li>getting into a good acting class (not Groupon!!)</li>
<li>figuring out how to be seen as serious actors in Los Angeles</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We're Asking For</h3>

<p><strong>WELCOME TO COMEDY LEMONADE</strong></p>
<p>My name is Elizabeth Kotite. I am a comedic actress  and playwright who has been in this business 9 years now. Most of my comedy experience comes from performing with the comedy group The Nat Turner Revue doing both sketch and improv which I have been a part of for 7 years as well as my work with other comedy groups and cabarets,  In 2016, I put up my first  full length play ""Misty's Plan"".  It was a look at the life of a girl who had to deal with such issues as divorce, bullying, and eventually school shootings and suicide. I played the part of Misty as well as produced it. In 2017, I put up my first solo piece ""Channel Surfing Through Life"" based on an actual incident of cyberbullying. Recently, I decided to move on to multimedia as an outlet for my work with the help of my wonderful co director, Samantha Samant (who directed Misty's Plan). Thus, the debut of my new web show ""Comedy Lemonade""</p>
<p>""Comedy Lemonade"" is a sketch comedy/ improv based web show covering topics from hillbillies meeting mermaids to the tide pod challenge and many more. I believe we live in a world where things are depressing with way too much hate. My dream is to build a world where we can escape and turn what is now misery into joy and entertainment. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p> currently we need $15,000 for editing, salaries for our wonderful cast and crew ( who work very hard and are currently performing and working for the love of the arts), and room expenses for rehearsals and shoots.  The breakdown of expenses looks like this:</p>
<p> editing  6,400</p>
<p> season salary for actors/crew- 6,654</p>
<p>room expenses- $1,954</p>
<p>If you do decide to donate you will receive special perks such as-  exclusive cast interviews, a special holiday compilation,  a never before seen sketch too controversial to air and more.if we do not reach the goal remaining funds will go to editing and cast/crew salaries. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>It seems as if we turn on the TV everyday and see the same old news stories about tragedy and the same old dramas on tv and the internet. Sadly, sketch comedy and comedy generally seems to  be a dying art form. So, I decided to bring sketch back and create a show that can bring us together. So, you will have an escape from the same old thing for something new and exciting and dare I say a bit insane. Also with everything being about me... me... me. it is tiring and boring. but comedy is always open to everyone and we make fun of everything. no topic is off limits so everything is relatable to everyone and I always want this to be about us. About friends and family.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Here's the thing. Everything in life is expensive.  Getting things together for a show like this is quite difficult. Rooms for shoots and rehearsals need to be paid for, actors/crew need to be paid, you need to pay to get things edited. it is quite difficult. Paying for rooms I have been able to manage thankfully but currently, I have a great team of crew and actors who are willing to do this for nothing until money is raised. which is why I have not only set up campaigns such as this one but have also started to create and sell merchandise. and find any way to make money as I can. I am determined more than anything to make this work. Like my other projects I do not want this to be gone and forgotten. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Now, I know some of you might not have the money to help out. I am asking for a lot. I do not want to force people to do something you can't do. if you can't contribute yourself however. please watch the show and spread the word about this to others.  Also watch and subscribe to the show and purchase swag on our tee spring site because it can not be OUR show without you. thank you.</p>

<p>Do you like watching shows on Netflix, Hulu, or HBO, but are frustrated when <i>s</i>eries you love get canceled, network executives pick the same, ""safe,"" tested content over and over, or your favorite shows take directions you hate?</p>
<p>Or are you a creator fighting <i>endless obstacles towards working in television</i>? With the near impossibility of breaking into the industry, you feel how hard it is to get your project seen, let alone made.</p>
<p>Then Candivan is for you.</p>
<p><strong>Candivan is a streaming site similar to Netflix or Prime</strong>, but it’s one where viewers get to make all of the decisions. Instead of network executives deciding which shows get made and the direction those shows take, you get to pick, giving creators a chance to make shows and have them seen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why this is so friggin cool for viewers</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553618104/haajqdx0lup4usbuezeq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Other streaming sites are all great, but they’re not incredibly different from Network TV. Producers make the decisions, with money, not viewers, being the bottom line.  Then there’s Youtube, which is fun and free, a wild west, but flooded with BILLIONS of videos, ranging from original, innovative documentaries to a six minute clip of a sink dripping. It’s a wonderful place to find Youtubers and cat videos, but a rough place to find quality, curated shows. A lot is also lost when an algorithm is trying to determine the best videos to show you.</p>
<p>Candivan is the step in between: we have curated full length running series, but it’s YOU who makes the decisions, not the producers. You pick which shows get renewed. You pick which shows receive higher budgets. And once it’s up and running, potential showrunners pitch their ideas to you.</p>
<p>This interactivity doesn't end with choosing shows and budgets. Many of the shows have options to participate, like voting on reality-show contestants, choosing scenarios, and even shaping plot lines. Viewers get ranks that include perks,  like being included in meetings with show casts and crews. Candivan isn't a platform where you passively watch TV; it's a platform where you're part of the show-making experience.</p> <h3><strong>Why this is dope AF for creators</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553618425/neele72xmkmooiyqzrb3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If you ever had the dream of making or working on your own TV show, Candivan wants to help make that happen. Making a show can be a nightmare, fighting against industry policies and discrimination, facing rejection after rejection, having a producer demand compromises that ruin your project, or spending your entire savings to create something that no one will see.</p>
<p>Anyone should have the opportunity to make a show and earn a living off of it. We give a far lower budget to produce a show than networks do, but it’s enough to create something without compromising. We have a range of shows from starter to premium ones, and we also offer mentorship to aspiring showrunners.</p>
<p>With any site that’s geared towards creators, the biggest problem is that when you DO happen to get your show made there’s often no audience. But Candivan plans to solve this by making this platform incredibly fun for viewers by creating many interactive in-house shows, offering lots of user choice,  and having ample opportunities to win prizes. This active experience should bring far more viewers to your show.</p>
<p>Candivan will take down the wall between creator and audience to be a platform where you get support and loyalty from viewers because they get to be part of the show-making experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Our Shows</h2>
<p>We’re working with some of the most talented, up-and-coming creators, ranging from seasoned filmmakers working on passion projects (like Koji Sakai, creator of <i>The Front Office)</i> to new and aspiring teams like the one behind <i>The Madams</i>.</p>

<p><strong>The Front Office</strong></p>
<p>A Shakespearean drama about a family-owned basketball franchise and the drama that ensues when the leadership switches from the father to one of his three daughters. Created by the legendary Koji Sakai.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Disappointing Life of Cassie Star</strong></p>
<p>Cassie Starr a former star, who after moving back to her hometown, must decide what to do with her life. She used to be on TV. She used to be on Broadway. She was in two movies.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Stand-Up </strong><b>Competition</b></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2>The deal</h2>
<p>We want to create fun, interactive shows for viewers, and opportuny and exposure for creators. We're hoping to raise $80,000. This $80k will help pay for building and hosting the site, and help fund the first set of shows to get made at launch -- which we’re aiming to do in July of 2019. </p>
<p><strong>If we hit our goal, here's what you will receive:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A fully functional site where you can vote for and interact with our shows</li>
<li>Four premium shows (trailers at the bottom of this page and on our website)</li>
<li>Five in-house, interactive, low-budget shows, descriptions below.</li>
<li>Levels and clubs you can join with opportunities to connect with creators/ stars and have more decision power</li>
<li>Access to some of the best independent TV shows and movies out there</li>
<li>Opportunities to submit shows and pitch ideas</li>
<li>Opportunities to view show submissions and select the shows you want to see</li>
<li>Much more</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here's exactly what we'll be doing with the $80,000:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$38,000 to shows, by far the most expensive piece of the operation.</li>
<li>$28,500 to the creation and maintenance of our website</li>
<li>$8,000 legal fees</li>
<li>$2,000 marketing/ advertisement</li>
<li>And the rest is Indiegogo/ platform fees</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't hit our goal, we will have to cut some of these things, like shows and site features. We'd hate to do this, but we want to be able to get a start no matter what.</p>

<p> </p>
</div></div>","Do you like watching shows on Netflix, Hulu, or HBO, but are frustrated when series you love get canceled, network executives pick the same, ""safe,"" tested content over and over, or your favorite shows take directions you hate?
Or are you a creator fighting endless obstacles towards working in television? With the near impossibility of breaking into the industry, you feel how hard it is to get your project seen, let alone made.
Then Candivan is for you.
Candivan is a streaming site similar to Netflix or Prime, but it’s one where viewers get to make all of the decisions. Instead of network executives deciding which shows get made and the direction those shows take, you get to pick, giving creators a chance to make shows and have them seen.
 
Why this is so friggin cool for viewers

Other streaming sites are all great, but they’re not incredibly different from Network TV. Producers make the decisions, with money, not viewers, being the bottom line.  Then there’s Youtube, which is fun and free, a wild west, but flooded with BILLIONS of videos, ranging from original, innovative documentaries to a six minute clip of a sink dripping. It’s a wonderful place to find Youtubers and cat videos, but a rough place to find quality, curated shows. A lot is also lost when an algorithm is trying to determine the best videos to show you.
Candivan is the step in between: we have curated full length running series, but it’s YOU who makes the decisions, not the producers. You pick which shows get renewed. You pick which shows receive higher budgets. And once it’s up and running, potential showrunners pitch their ideas to you.
This interactivity doesn't end with choosing shows and budgets. Many of the shows have options to participate, like voting on reality-show contestants, choosing scenarios, and even shaping plot lines. Viewers get ranks that include perks,  like being included in meetings with show casts and crews. Candivan isn't a platform where you passively watch TV; it's a platform where you're part of the show-making experience. Why this is dope AF for creators

If you ever had the dream of making or working on your own TV show, Candivan wants to help make that happen. Making a show can be a nightmare, fighting against industry policies and discrimination, facing rejection after rejection, having a producer demand compromises that ruin your project, or spending your entire savings to create something that no one will see.
Anyone should have the opportunity to make a show and earn a living off of it. We give a far lower budget to produce a show than networks do, but it’s enough to create something without compromising. We have a range of shows from starter to premium ones, and we also offer mentorship to aspiring showrunners.
With any site that’s geared towards creators, the biggest problem is that when you DO happen to get your show made there’s often no audience. But Candivan plans to solve this by making this platform incredibly fun for viewers by creating many interactive in-house shows, offering lots of user choice,  and having ample opportunities to win prizes. This active experience should bring far more viewers to your show.
Candivan will take down the wall between creator and audience to be a platform where you get support and loyalty from viewers because they get to be part of the show-making experience.
 
Our Shows
We’re working with some of the most talented, up-and-coming creators, ranging from seasoned filmmakers working on passion projects (like Koji Sakai, creator of The Front Office) to new and aspiring teams like the one behind The Madams.
These are some of the shows that are going to be on our network when we launch (see our site to look at full trailers): The Madams
A dark comedy about the misadventures of two sisters, Logan and Madison, as they attempt to run a secret escort service in Los Angeles. When Logan becomes a suspect in a murder at her former brothel, their new business and sisterly bond are tested.
 
The Front Office
A Shakespearean drama about a family-owned basketball franchise and the drama that ensues when the leadership switches from the father to one of his three daughters. Created by the legendary Koji Sakai.
 
The Disappointing Life of Cassie Star
Cassie Starr a former star, who after moving back to her hometown, must decide what to do with her life. She used to be on TV. She used to be on Broadway. She was in two movies. But Cassie Starr is starting to realize that she’s no longer a star and maybe never was. Starring Girl Code actress and writer Shalyah Evans.
 
Stand-Up Competition
A stand-up competition in the Bay Area where comedians are pitted against each other and viewers decide on the winners. Grand winner will have the first ever Candivan stand-up special.
 
Speed Dating
A speed dating competition where you can see different dates live, and you have full control over what you want. Viewers get to play matchmaker.
 
And much, much more.
 
Trailer for The Front Office:

 
The deal
We want to create fun, interactive shows for viewers, and opportuny and exposure for creators. We're hoping to raise $80,000. This $80k will help pay for building and hosting the site, and help fund the first set of shows to get made at launch -- which we’re aiming to do in July of 2019. 
If we hit our goal, here's what you will receive:

A fully functional site where you can vote for and interact with our shows
Four premium shows (trailers at the bottom of this page and on our website)
Five in-house, interactive, low-budget shows, descriptions below.
Levels and clubs you can join with opportunities to connect with creators/ stars and have more decision power
Access to some of the best independent TV shows and movies out there
Opportunities to submit shows and pitch ideas
Opportunities to view show submissions and select the shows you want to see
Much more

Here's exactly what we'll be doing with the $80,000:

$38,000 to shows, by far the most expensive piece of the operation.
$28,500 to the creation and maintenance of our website
$8,000 legal fees
$2,000 marketing/ advertisement
And the rest is Indiegogo/ platform fees

If we don't hit our goal, we will have to cut some of these things, like shows and site features. We'd hate to do this, but we want to be able to get a start no matter what.

<p>I am a passionate gamer through and through, always have been, always will. I care about the gaming community and I have always wanted to be more involved and contribute. Now, I have the opportunity to do that and the way I want to do it is through <a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/k3ngenator"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">streaming a show on my own channel</a>. It is something I have always wanted to do but never had the time nor the resources to pull it off. Now I have all the time I need to dedicate myself to this project.   </p>
<p>Streaming video games is a lot more than about playing video games! Because if you think about it, watching a game with no commentary or people to interact with isn't all that much fun. Imagine going to watch a football match and the only people there are yourself and the players. Not quite as good! That is the beauty of streaming. It brings together a community of people who all share the same interests under the banner of a streamer, whose job it is to provide an entertaining, rewarding show that people can enjoy. And that is exactly what I am going to do.</p>

<p>Well, while I have all the passion, charisma and dashing good looks to make an excellent streamer, I don't have a computer. So, you guessed it, I need to buy a computer! I'll also need all the hardware for streaming as well, such as a headset, a microphone and a camera. Computer wise, I need it to be fairly powerful to be able to play games on visually appealing settings as well as run streaming software, use on screen updates, track announcements, check stream health and a surprising amount of other stuff that goes on at the same time. It doesn't need to be top of the line, just a solid machine that can do what I need it to do for 6-12 months or so. Below is a list of everything I am looking for in terms of hardware that will allow me to start creating my show:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-7600K LGA 1151</li>
<li>GPU: GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB</li>
<li>RAM: G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 16GB</li>
<li>Motherboard: MSI Z270 GAMING PRO CARBON Intel Z270</li>
<li>Power Supply: EVGA EVGA SuperNOVA 650W G1 80Plus</li>
<li>Case: NZXT S340 Mid Tower Computer Case</li>
<li>CPU cooler: Cooler Master Hyper T2 - Compact CPU Cooler </li>
<li>Monitor: BenQ GL2760H 27""</li>
<li>Headset: LOGITECH G430 DTS Headphone</li>
<li>Camera: Logitech c920</li>
</ul>
<p>For the uninitiated, that is everything one needs to build a computer as well as the camera, headphones/microphone that you need to broadcast yourself to the viewers. Once I have this, it will take 1 week to get everything ready to start.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494875377/aycdrgmqh0jgsnhwbtdj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>£1750: I will buy one extra monitor at £150. Streaming requires a lot of screen real estate, many different windows open at the same time, the most important of which is your chat! Which is hard to read when the game takes up the whole screen. An extra monitor will make the viewing and interaction a lot smoother. The extra £100 will go towards a new keyboard and mouse. Not top end, but something that is going to be comfortable, as I will be using them 9 hours every day!   </p>
<p>£2000: Streaming is a major CPU intensive process; a lot of streamers have a computer dedicated to it! I won't be too greedy and ask for another computer, but an upgrade to an i7 processor will help keep everything running smoothly. Also, a proper microphone will be great. As well as a boom filter, to make my voice sound silky smooth. Audio and video quality gives a better image, helping to get more people watching.</p>
<p>£2500: This would be incredible and would be enough to make an almost perfect setup! I won't hold my breath for this but, if achieved, I would be able to get additional things like a sound card and video capture card, so the sound would be much better and I can capture footage from consoles as well, increasing my potential audience. As well, upgrades here and there to the RAM and GPU would ensure I could do this for a while to come!</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the project, there are no real risks involved. The only thing of difficulty is getting to Colombia and finding somewhere that sells all the pieces, as it is generally cheaper to buy there than in Ecuador. Luckily I have friends there that can help me out so, once I am there, it shouldn't be too difficult to locate all the parts I need! I have found every piece online on Colombian websites, so I will definitely be able to get everything. I have built my last 2 PCs back in the UK so I am not going to fumble putting it together either! As I said, due to it's nature it is a safe project, so after the success of the campaign I willbe up and running within a month :)</p>

<p>As a last note, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for reading all the way down to the bottom of the page! I know that sounds funny, but you would probably not be here unless you felt this project is worthwhile. To me, this endeavour has meant so much. I have learned all kinds of things that genuinely excite me which is a first in my life. It really is wonderful to work on something that you are truely passionate about, which I always thought sounded a bit cliche, but now I understand exactly what that means. I am looking forward to doing this for years to come, to build my skillset and earn a place in this beautiful community. Again, thank you for reading down this far, it means a lot! Please consider helping, either through a pledge, sharing with your friends or, preferably, both ;) THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU</p>

<h3>This is Our What? </h3>
<p>The youth culture of Newcastle, Australia also known as ‘Newy’, ‘Spewy’, ‘Spewcastle’,  and ‘Steel City’  has been separated into different cultures. ‘This is Our Newcastle’s focus is to give young Novocastrians the opportunity to talk about their cultural activity and explain how they feel their subculture fits into a wider Newcastle identity. </p>
<p>The idea was sparked from a conversation between the TWOhours North team in class about how youth in Newcastle is perceived and opportunities these young people have to share their voice. As the 7th largest city in Australia, Newcastle is inevitably made up of multiple subcultures. The subcultures that are the focus of TiON are; Surfing, Skating, Sports, Coffee, and Music. Catch ya down at Dixon for a shorey, grinding bar beach bowl, sipping on a Blue Door coffee while watching the Saturday arvo footy or livin’ it up in the main room at the Cambo. There are many different faces that make up Newcastle and TWOhours North want to capture the city in all its glory to showcase it to the world. As part of the overall goal of creating this series, TWOhours North wants to enter the series into Real Film Festival to utilise its platform to increase the reach of 'This is Our Newcastle' to a larger audience. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566215221/m3olkdsytfdr7ka6uq8t.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>This is Our Who?</h3>
<p>TWOhours North is composed of five University of Newcastle students. All studying Creative Industries although all with different majors, this provides the team with a wide variety of skills and knowledge. As part of the final year in Creative Industries, each student is required to complete a major project as individuals or part of a group. This team of students came together with a shared vision of showcasing the broad cultural identity of Newcastle through film.</p>
<p>Director Helena Kallinis is trained in visual arts practices and despite being new to this role is eager to venture out of her comfort zone to learn skills in a  different sector of the Creative industries. Victoria Bridge is more familiar with her role as a writer as she has been a part of various media production teams. She is making her writing debut with ‘This is Our Newcastle’. Cinematographer, Daniel Lane is experienced in similar roles such as photography, film and editing. Rachel Bergquist and Adriana Flaherty complete the team in their shared role as producers. Both with different sets of skills in media, they will come together to ensure the documentary will be created in its highest quality. Working with industry professionals the, passionate soon to be graduates, TWOhours North team aim to premiere their first documentary in late 2019, hopefully with more projects to follow. </p>

<h3>This is Our Need. </h3>
<p>To get our project off to a roaring start and get people interested in what were creating, we need to cover some costs first. We require help in paying for aspects of the project such as, artist payment, printing costs, film festival entry fees, ticketed access to filming locations, paid professionals, and a contingency for any unforeseen expenses that roll our way. </p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566285817/ixeo9acjpavzt8xhsbn3.png"" src=""""/><p>As the production of the film is being done using personal equipment and our own skills where possible, this project is operating on a relatively small budget; with the majority of the proceeds from this campaign going towards the promotion of the film through the cost of printed media, festival submission fees and paying hannah for her excellent work in designing our poster.  We want to showcase Newcastle in all its glory, and in order to do so we are required at times to purchase entry to certain events. While this is an extra cost it will allow us to present a unique storytelling environment that is ideal for 'This is Our Newcastle'.</p>

<p>We have completed phase one and we are right now in the midst of phase two. With your help we will be able to complete phase two more successfully such as; paying our artist, getting posters and stickers printed, our fees to enter the Real Film Festival etc... then once all the filming and editing is complete we will be able to move on to the final phase! Phase Three consists of promoting, distribution and giving back. During this phase, all of our rewards from this campaign will be sent out to you! Our lovely contributors! Except of course for our top contributors who we will be in contact with in regards to appearing in the series.</p>

</div></div>","This is Our What? 
The youth culture of Newcastle, Australia also known as ‘Newy’, ‘Spewy’, ‘Spewcastle’,  and ‘Steel City’  has been separated into different cultures. ‘This is Our Newcastle’s focus is to give young Novocastrians the opportunity to talk about their cultural activity and explain how they feel their subculture fits into a wider Newcastle identity. 
The idea was sparked from a conversation between the TWOhours North team in class about how youth in Newcastle is perceived and opportunities these young people have to share their voice. As the 7th largest city in Australia, Newcastle is inevitably made up of multiple subcultures. The subcultures that are the focus of TiON are; Surfing, Skating, Sports, Coffee, and Music. Catch ya down at Dixon for a shorey, grinding bar beach bowl, sipping on a Blue Door coffee while watching the Saturday arvo footy or livin’ it up in the main room at the Cambo. There are many different faces that make up Newcastle and TWOhours North want to capture the city in all its glory to showcase it to the world. As part of the overall goal of creating this series, TWOhours North wants to enter the series into Real Film Festival to utilise its platform to increase the reach of 'This is Our Newcastle' to a larger audience. 

 
This is Our Who?
TWOhours North is composed of five University of Newcastle students. All studying Creative Industries although all with different majors, this provides the team with a wide variety of skills and knowledge. As part of the final year in Creative Industries, each student is required to complete a major project as individuals or part of a group. This team of students came together with a shared vision of showcasing the broad cultural identity of Newcastle through film.
Director Helena Kallinis is trained in visual arts practices and despite being new to this role is eager to venture out of her comfort zone to learn skills in a  different sector of the Creative industries. Victoria Bridge is more familiar with her role as a writer as she has been a part of various media production teams. She is making her writing debut with ‘This is Our Newcastle’. Cinematographer, Daniel Lane is experienced in similar roles such as photography, film and editing. Rachel Bergquist and Adriana Flaherty complete the team in their shared role as producers. Both with different sets of skills in media, they will come together to ensure the documentary will be created in its highest quality. Working with industry professionals the, passionate soon to be graduates, TWOhours North team aim to premiere their first documentary in late 2019, hopefully with more projects to follow. 

This is Our Need. 
To get our project off to a roaring start and get people interested in what were creating, we need to cover some costs first. We require help in paying for aspects of the project such as, artist payment, printing costs, film festival entry fees, ticketed access to filming locations, paid professionals, and a contingency for any unforeseen expenses that roll our way. 
As the production of the film is being done using personal equipment and our own skills where possible, this project is operating on a relatively small budget; with the majority of the proceeds from this campaign going towards the promotion of the film through the cost of printed media, festival submission fees and paying hannah for her excellent work in designing our poster.  We want to showcase Newcastle in all its glory, and in order to do so we are required at times to purchase entry to certain events. While this is an extra cost it will allow us to present a unique storytelling environment that is ideal for 'This is Our Newcastle'.

 
This is Our Where. 
Our project has three phases:
And this is where we're at...
We have completed phase one and we are right now in the midst of phase two. With your help we will be able to complete phase two more successfully such as; paying our artist, getting posters and stickers printed, our fees to enter the Real Film Festival etc... then once all the filming and editing is complete we will be able to move on to the final phase! Phase Three consists of promoting, distribution and giving back. During this phase, all of our rewards from this campaign will be sent out to you! Our lovely contributors! Except of course for our top contributors who we will be in contact with in regards to appearing in the series.


 

This is Our Thanks
By making a donation to TiON you will not only be supporting a bunch of Newcastle kids just trying to make their ideas come to life, but also the creative industries, indie films and a chance for Newcastle’s charm to be shown to the world.  As Newcastle’s next generation of creatives, we need your help to give the industry an audience that enjoys and responds to projects like these. We explore how the city advances from steel production to an innovative and cultural one whilst being amongst the revolution ourselves. Be a part of the change by supporting TWOhours North and TiON.   
Simply by donating, you're helping this project come to life so we'd like to give back! Each donation level comes with rewards! Starting with a name in the thank you credits, to a spot in the film! We like to support local where ever we can, so included in the perks are promotional items such as stickers and a poster designed by Hannah Dunn!

<h3><strong>Who We are</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Labrisz Lesbian Association</strong> was established in 1999. It works to create a society where women have the opportunity to freely choose their partners and lifestyles and to express their sexualities without restrictions. <strong>We organize </strong>monthly community programs (film club, game club, discussion evenings, social gatherings), an annual cultural festival (LIFT Festival), and LGBT History Month.</p>

<p>We offer a sensitizing program for schools and workplaces, called “Getting to Know LGBT People”. In order to <strong>preserve and promote lesbian and feminist culture in Hungary</strong>, we have a “Lesbian Herstory Archive”.</p>
<p><i><strong>We publish books, including the fairy tale collection “Fairyland is for Everyone” (2020) which has been scandalized by extremist politicians and became a bestseller, soon to be published in several other languages.</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Second Golden Age</strong></h3>
<p>The pandemic is making it hard for the lesbian (LBT women’s) community to stay connected. During the Covid-19 pandemic we mostly keep in touch through digital devices. However, not everyone is able to access these technologies equally easily. <strong>Women of different age groups may differ in their skills and knowledge of how to best utilize their smartphones, navigate different apps, or how to stay safe online.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We have filmed a romantic educational video series</strong> in six episodes about two middle-aged women who have met online, to introduce viewers to using these digital devices and apps more efficiently and safely.</p>
<p><i>Judit and Tünde </i>are on different levels of familiarity with their computers and smartphones, and their life situation is different, as well: Judit is from the capital city, freshly out of a long-term relationship, and Tünde lives in the countryside, which makes it hard for her to meet new people.</p>

<p><strong>We need 2,500 Euros in order to be able to finish the post-production work for the video series, which includes creating the visual effects used for transferring IT information, and for sound mixing and lighting.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>The circumstances</strong></h3>
<p>The needs of older generations of LBTI women and those living in social environments where technological savviness is not a given are often overlooked or neglected. <strong>Such needs are exacerbated by the isolation because of the covid-19 pandemia on the one hand, and an oppressive, homo- and transphobic socio-political environment in Hungary, where many people fear being open about their sexuality more than before, on the other hand.</strong></p>
<p>The film production team has a sound track record of films depicting the lives of LGBTQI people and Labrisz has a rich experience in community organizing, therefore the film is expected to be a great success.</p>

<p>That's why teen girls in Ghana need a positive and refreshing show they can rush home to, just as I did. A show that reflects all Ghanaian teen girls, be they  big, short, slim, physically challenged, dark, hearing impaired, tall or fair.  A show that explores  the issues they consider important, that shows them they are important, and presented by teen girls, just like them.</p>
<p><i>At the moment what they normally hear is:</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">‘Do as you’re told!’ ‘Study! Study! Study!’ ‘Pass your exams!</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">‘Be disciplined and obedient!'</h3>
<p>There's nothing wrong with that ... but .., what about money management skills, learning about their bodies, exercise, careers advice, thinking outside the box, standing up for themselves, learning to say 'No' without feeling guilty, reaching for the stars and other skills that will help them grow into confident, well informed people who take responsibility for themselves?</p>

<p>FABteen has been a dream for over 4 years and last year my small crew and I were able to film 2 episodes. </p>
<p>Companies in Ghana who we've approached for funding, love the show and see it's value but aren't ready to invest. Why? It's unique and untested (only 6% of television programming is aimed at the 0 - 19yr age range; and they are mostly foreign cartoons). There is an assumption that teens don't have money, so businesses are reluctant to invest in a project with teens as the target audience - teens who apparently don't have money to buy their products.</p>
<p>Our teens are our country's future adults and it is important that we invest in them. Television is such a powerful tool and perfect to reach as many teens girls across the country, and the continent. And you know what, once season 1 is aired, all those who didn't have faith will come running to jump on board for season 2 and beyond. FABteen's existence will be the catalyst that will inspire other television content producers to produce for the teen market.</p>

I used to be a teenager!
I remember making sure never to get detention on Thursdays, because the moment the school bell rang at 3:30pm, my friend Maureen and I would run, as if the Devil were on our tail, and arrive home out of breath, just in time for our favourite TV programme.

That's why teen girls in Ghana need a positive and refreshing show they can rush home to, just as I did. A show that reflects all Ghanaian teen girls, be they  big, short, slim, physically challenged, dark, hearing impaired, tall or fair.  A show that explores  the issues they consider important, that shows them they are important, and presented by teen girls, just like them.
At the moment what they normally hear is:
‘Do as you’re told!’ ‘Study! Study! Study!’ ‘Pass your exams!
‘Be disciplined and obedient!'
There's nothing wrong with that ... but .., what about money management skills, learning about their bodies, exercise, careers advice, thinking outside the box, standing up for themselves, learning to say 'No' without feeling guilty, reaching for the stars and other skills that will help them grow into confident, well informed people who take responsibility for themselves?




Fabteen presenters Precious and Maame Serwaa

As you can see from our short video, FABteen is colourful, friendly and fresh. It's a 30 minute weekly programme, with 8 segments per episode.
Each episode has 6 unrelated FAB segment topics and 2 Vox Pops.
In one episode; we have beauty - how to fight pimples with natural home made products, how to deal with bullying, tips to boost confidence, learning about the culture of another country - some phrases and a recipe, creating individual fashion style, social issues discussion forum, and two vox pops (street interviews) relating to any of the segments showcased.
The following episode will have 6 new topics and 2 vox pops.
Each episode will have 'signing' so that teens who are hearing impaired can follow and enjoy the show.

A good television production costs. Cameras, lighting, cast, locations ... and the list goes on.  We're a small team with a fantastic project and we need help to make it a reality. YOUR  help.
The goal is $63,000 to shoot Season 1 (13 episodes).
Where will the money go?

How will the money be spent?
As each episode has 6 segments and 2 vox pops, there will be a lot of logistics to organize before we shoot.
 We will need to secure Locations, People to interview, Equipment hire (if we can buy some, even better), Food (very important), Transportation, Costumes, Props, Visual and Sound editing, and last but not least, Pay the young up and coming cast & crew a proper wage.
We plan to spend:

4 weeks in pre-production: Decorating Maame and Precious's FAB studio; securing locations; people to interview; costumes, etc.
24 to 28 days to shoot the series - 2 days to film content for an episode, and a couple of days for any pick ups
2 - 3 months in post production

We aim is to be on air in January 2018.
We will  update you as to where and on what we use the funds, including what we are up to in the filming process.

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>CHILL GIRL follows the lives of three recent graduates as they move to Los Angeles and balance figuring their shit out, sex and love, and new friendships. Whether it be managing their up and coming chocolate blog, figuring out if they’re a fuck buddy or not, or battling their work enemy, the crew somehow manages to screw up all three.</p>
<p>CHILL GIRL focuses on one of the most difficult times in a person's life: post-grad. We spend the first twenty-two years of our lives working our way through school and preparing for what's next. But once we hold up that diploma and leave our college campuses, we begin to ask ourselves that terrifying question: Now what?</p>
<p>In this web series, we aim to show an honest depiction of what this part of life is really like. It's scary, it's exciting, it's messy, and it's filled with possibilities. For Jess, Damien, and Claire, the fun (and drama) comes from figuring it all out. And when every day is filled with unexpected job opportunities, love affairs, and new friendships, ""figuring it all out"" is easier said than done.</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><u>Creators:</u></p>
<p><strong>Jessie Vane </strong>is a Los Angeles based actor and writer who recently graduated with a B.S. from Northwestern University, where she studied acting and playwriting. During her time in Chicago, she dove into the world of experimental film and theater, mentored playwrights through Vertigo Productions and was lucky enough to see her work go up at Victory Gardens. Since moving to Los Angeles, Jessie has been lucky enough to act at Santa Monica Playhouse, Long Beach Shakespeare Company, as well as in several short films. Other than obsessing over her cats (yikes), she's preparing to laugh at her own struggles in Chill Girl! jessievane.com.</p>
<p><strong>Samantha Casesa </strong>is an actor and born and raised New Yorker who traded bagels for palm trees when she moved to LA last year. She recently graduated from Northwestern University’s theatre program with a concentration in acting for screen. At Northwestern, she learned how to combine her love of art and social justice through working with Lipstick Theatre, a theatre group dedicated to tackling women's issues through performance. She moved to LA to follow a life-long love and admiration of TV and film and is really passionate about opportunities like these to create her own content. She is represented by Velmont Talent Agency.</p>
<p><strong>Julian Larach </strong>is an actor originally from San Francisco who moved to LA after graduating from Northwestern University in 2019 with a B.A. in theater. While attending school in Chicago, he made his professional theatrical debut in 'Sycamore' at the Raven Theater. Now after doing a few squats and hip thrusts, he's back to California to pursue a career in TV &amp; Film. He is represented theatrically by Commercial Talent Agency. </p>
<p><u>Producers:</u></p>
<p><strong>Max Kliman</strong> is a recent graduate from Northwestern University. He currently works as an executive assistant at a management company and uses his free time to make sketch comedy videos. He previously produced The Blackout - Northwestern's Late Night Show, and co-created the web series BIG SQUAD. An aspiring producer, Max is excited to help create something meaningful, funny, and relatable. He also just learned how to make a smoothie so is now one step closer to being an adult. </p>
<p><strong>Sarah Evans</strong> is the most recent graduate of Northwestern University on the team, but graduating in the pandemic class matured her to the level of Peter. Sarah's short films and scripts have travelled the festival circuits, garnering her recognition from Cannes, Los Angeles Film Festival, Austin Script Competition, Heartland Film Festival, Indie Short Fest, and more. She produced The Blackout (late night comedy show), ran Studio 22 Productions (student run production company), and founded Northwestern's chapter of Team Enough (gun violence prevention group). Now that Sarah's graduated, she just sleeps, watches horror movies, and plays with her puppy (DM for pics).</p>
<p><strong>Peter Condie</strong> is a not-as-recent-as-the-other-two-but-still-thinks-of-himself-as-pretty-recent graduate from Northwestern University. He previously worked at NBCUniversal as a part of their West Coast Page Program and recently started as an assistant at a premium cable network. With hopes of producing television, Peter is excited for his first foray into producing web series. He also recently finished a science-fiction novel titled ""The Three Body Problem"" and thinks you should read it too. </p>
<h3>Your Donation</h3>
<p>CHILL GIRL will be shot with a modest goal budget of $5,000.</p>
<p>To keep the budget low, we thankfully have friends of extraordinary talent both in front of and behind the camera who have volunteered their time and energy to the project. This allows us to cut down on major costs involved with cast and crew, and focus money that would be spent in those categories elsewhere. </p>
<p>The largest portion of our budget is allocated to On-Set Expenses (30.5%), which will cover all the basic materials needed to handle emergencies on-set (duct tape, power extenders, etc..), as well as craft services to keep our dedicated volunteer friends happy to fed. </p>
<p>Similar to cast &amp; crew, our locations budget is razor-thin. Thanks to a network of friends and family in the Los Angeles area, we believe we will be able to shoot on location for free due to their generosity. </p>
<p>The lack of cast, crew, and locations budget will allow us to rent high-quality lighting and sound equipment (13.4%), ensuring a professional-quality final product. We'll also be able to dedicate more funds than usual to props, costumes, and production design (8.1%), allowing our talented production team to create genuine, authentic environments on-set. </p>
<p>Our goal is to showcase this web-series at various festivals across North America; to achieve this we'll be setting aside roughly 10% of the budget to cover submission costs. </p>
<p>Rounding out our budget is the expected transportation costs (8.1%) of our cast &amp; crew, and a small contingency (9.2%) to be used wherever deemed most necessary. </p>
<p>The CHILL GIRL team is committed to creating the highest-quality web-series possible, and each dollar of your donation will aid us in our goal of delivering an original, comedic, and compelling story.  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div><p>Your donation will help bring this project to life and allow us to create something both entertaining and meaningful. We don't pretend to have all the answers, but we hope that by creating an honest, genuine depiction of the post-grad experience, we can help ourselves and others make sense of it. We want our viewers to see themselves in our characters, and we hope everyone will walk away feeling at least a little bit better about not having their lives together. And if you do have your life together at this point, please reach out. We have questions.</p></div><div>
<h3>Safety and Inclusivity</h3>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, we will make sure that all shooting is conducted in the safest way possible. That means required masks, minimal crew members on set at a time, and frequent testing. Any scenes that require larger numbers of people will be shot last as to allow for maximum preparation time to make sure all safety protocols are followed. We're excited to bring this project to life, but our priority is the health of our entire team, and if there are any health issues we will immediately halt production until we are able to safely film.</p>
<p>In terms of inclusivity, we want to create an environment where our entire team feels valued. We want everyone to feel like CHILL GIRL is their project, and each person involved should feel as though they played a significant role in its creation. No matter the skill level or previous experience, we want our entire team to be excited about showing up to set and making these episodes. This will not be one of those projects where the director is the only person allowed to speak on set. This will be a collaborative, fun process, and we're so excited to combine everyone's ideas to create the best product possible.</p>

<p>Sean hires employees from various backgrounds including the palm-reading Morgan (Deanna Shaekel), former NFL lineman and cannabis savant Jeep (Elliot Mealer), and Michelin star pastry chef Alex (Rachael Thompson).  Together this team builds the Boulder Buds brand while overcoming legal and comedic hurdles.</p>
<p>Taking from influences such as It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, Arrested Development, Cheers, and Taxi, the show will be a vehicle for some of Florida's best comedic actors and bring recognition to talent in the Central Florida area.</p>
<p>Emmy award winning producer Larry Hardnett and Jared Bolhuis are producing Boulder Buds and the “Face of CMT” Lance Smith, is directing.</p>

<h3>Hi, I'm Mike from Epic Duck Studios</h3>
<p>You might know me from my YouTube channel, or my live Twitch shows. I've been making hobby tutorials for wargamers in some capacity since 2009, and I'd like to take that further than I ever have before. To produce better quality content and focus on producing it full-time, I need to complete some renovations to my studio space, get some new equipment, and set up a safety net to pay the bills while I get things rolling.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As I'll be working full-time from my home, I need to make sure some basic household expenses are met in the coming months while I ramp up video production and take on painting clients. On top of that, there are 3 things I'd specifically like to do to improve the audio quality in my studio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install acoustic insulation and an acoustic tile drop ceiling in the studio to cut down on noise travelling from upstairs.</li>
<li>Install new cabinets to help better organize the space while also cutting down on some noise transmission from the nearby central air unit.</li>
<li>Upgrade the microphone I use when narrating YouTube tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<p>In return, I pledge to continue producing 6 live Twitch streams, and a minimum of 2 new YouTube tutorials plus one additional video every week (with exceptions for holidays, because I'm human).  Aside from making more content than ever before, I'm also offering a few perks to those who can give a little more as my way of saying Thank You!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why YOU should support this project</h3>
<p>I love teaching others how to paint their miniatures well, and take pride in their work. I'm on a mission to rid the world of unpainted miniatures. By funding this project, you're helping to ensure that I can pursue that passion all day, every day, teaching people on both Twitch and YouTube to LOVE painting their miniatures. This project is as much about supporting my family as it is about upgrading my studio - I want to make sure my wife and son have a roof over their head and food on the table, while also pursuing a career I'm highly passionate about.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The specific goals of this project are essentially risk-free - I've assembled cabinets and drop ceilings before, and completing those tasks is effectively a non-issue. The risk comes from the fact that I've already left my old career behind and I'm actively pursuing this as a full-time endevour. I need to get the ball rolling and fast so that painting commissions and video production can comfortably pay the bills. I'm confident that in a few months time I'll have plenty of painting work and other revenue coming in, but I'd love to get to that point safely.<br/><br/>I should point out that this isn't my first rodeo - I operated Epic Duck Studios full-time through most of 2009 and 2010, and that was before Twitch or Patreon existed.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not ready to support this campaign, there's a few other ways you can help out:</p>

<li>Spread the word! If you're a fan of my tutorials and shows, tell your friends!</li>
<li>Become a Patron at <a href=""https://patreon.com/epicduck"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">patreon.com/epicduck</a> - even a dollar a month helps keep the lights on and the paint flowing.</li>

<h3>The Goal Breakdown</h3>
<p>To be as transparent as possible, here are my goals. As mentioned in the Campaign Video, 50% of each goal will go toward paying the mortgage and other bills so the studio can keep operating, while the other half will go toward upgrades.<br/><br/><strong>Goal 1:</strong> Acoustic Ceiling: $1058<br/><strong>Goal 2:</strong> Ikea Cabinets: +$1686  ($2744 running total)<br/><strong>Goal 3:</strong> Sennheiser Mic: +$1600 ($4344 running total) (converted from $599 USD)</p>

<p><br/><strong>THE BIG GOAL - $10000+?</strong><br/>If this campaign just blows up in a totally unexpected way, I'm prepared to renovate the garage into a dedicated full-time studio space. This will include insulation, sound dampening, air filtration, and running new electrical and plumbing to the garage, as well as erecting a small shed in the back yard to house much of what's currently stored in it. In this dream goal, I'd have two dedicated painting stations for myself and a guest, as well as a dedicated airbrushing booth, and a gaming table on-site. Streaming RPGs from the garage would not be out of the question.  I have not actually estimated the cost of this project yet because at this time I just consider it a pipe dream... but stranger things have happened.</p>

<h2>ABOUT BUCK'S</h2>
<p>Buck's is a new web series, written and produced by Molly Faber and Austin Calam. It follows a group of small town baristas in the Midwest, where hijinks abound and coffee is taken a little... okay, WAY too seriously. Your donation will help us pay for the production costs, location rental, wardrobe, and props.</p>
<h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
<p>Molly Faber is the creator of Buck's and will also be producing, directing, and acting in Buck's. She has an MFA in Acting as well as experience directing and coaching actors.</p>
<p>Austin Calam is a writer for Buck's and will also be producing, filming, and directing Buck's. He is a film maker with acting and directing experience. </p>
<p>This is Molly and Austin's first project of this magnitude, and they have big plans for it. By contributing, YOU will help make Buck's a reality! </p>
</div><div>
<h2>WHY ARE WE FUNDRAISING</h2>
<p>Since the pandemic started, jobs for actors and filmmakers have become even more scarce than they were pre-pandemic. So we thought: why not make our own work? And thus Buck's was born!</p>
<p>However, filmmaking is... expensive. We have a clear and exciting vision for Buck's, but we can't make it happen on our own. That's why we need YOU! </p>
<p>Here's what your donation will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production Costs: This is our largest expense and includes all things needed to produce a film: lights, camera, action! </li>
<li>Location Rental: good locations = a good looking web series</li>
<li>Wardrobe, Props, Set Dressing: these details ensure that Buck's looks like... Buck's! </li>
</ul>
<h3>WHAT IF YOU EXCEED YOUR GOAL?</h3>
<p>First of all, that would be AMAZING! Second, here's how we would use that money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crew and Actor salaries: At this point, our amazing cast and crew are volunteers. Exceeding our goal would mean we could pay them for their time and hard work.</li>
<li>Food for the Cast and Crew: A well fed cast and crew is a happy cast and crew!</li>
<li>Festival Fees: We believe strongly in Buck's and our ability to make a great web series, SO we plan to enter Buck's into festivals. Unfortunately, entering things into festivals is not free.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2>WHY SUPPORT BUCK'S?</h2>
<p>As we thought about what story we wanted to tell we realized that there isn't a show out there that tells the stories of baristas, and very few stories set in small towns. Both of us are from a small town and love a good cup of coffee. We also have both previously worked as baristas. It made sense that we would tell a story that we are familiar with, and we would love if you would help us get our story, crazy as it might be, out into the world!</p>
<p>Additionally, as creatives who are relatively new to this industry, it is so important to build a solid resume and have excellent material to show what we can do. Buck's would provide us this opportunity. Supporting Buck's would mean supporting the dreams of two (very cool) artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>A SINCERE THANK YOU</h2>
<p>Asking for money is always a weird and difficult thing, and it is not one that we take lightly. We value that you have even read down this far and taken the time to consider donating to Buck's. Whether you hit that donate button or not, THANK YOU for being here! We could not make this project happen without the support of people like you! </p>

We have filmed and released the first two episodes which are already garnishing awards at web film festivals across the globe. We are here to ask you to join us on this journey to finish the next six episodes to complete the first season.</p><p>These are challenging times and the cast and crew are all hoping to get back to work as soon as possible and these funds will help get us there. They have put so much hard work and care into this project and it shows on the screen.</p><p>Almost 70% of the money raised will go to paying the cast and crew. The rest will go to renting the gear from small companies and for paying for permits and locations. One of the locations from the second episode was rented from a home for dance students attending a school and the money we payed went towards helping them. So every little bit helps not just us but with a conscious effort others in need as well.</p><h3><strong>Awards for Episode One and Two</strong></h3><p>We are hitting the festival circuit with our first two episodes and have already garnered several awards.</p><p>New York Independent Film Awards - Best Web Series - Monthly Edition</p><p>Oniros Film Festival - Best Web Series - Monthly Edition</p><p>Festigious Film Festival - Best Web Series - Monthly Edition</p><p>Indie Film Fest - Outstanding Achievement Web &amp; New Media</p><p>Indie Film Fest - Winner - Best Original Song ""Night Lies""</p><p>We are also in the official selection for the Valley Film Festival in August, 2020 which is a fitting venue since we filmed mostly in the San Fernando Valley. Hopefully we will be in a better place with everything then to have a live screening.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3><p>We are aiming high and shooting for quality.

Frank James is a classical journey told in a modern tale of life and death, love and betrayal; set in a city that is on the verge of civil unrest. This story is being told as a web series and is as ambitious as the main character. We have filmed and released the first two episodes which are already garnishing awards at web film festivals across the globe. We are here to ask you to join us on this journey to finish the next six episodes to complete the first season.These are challenging times and the cast and crew are all hoping to get back to work as soon as possible and these funds will help get us there. They have put so much hard work and care into this project and it shows on the screen.Almost 70% of the money raised will go to paying the cast and crew. The rest will go to renting the gear from small companies and for paying for permits and locations. One of the locations from the second episode was rented from a home for dance students attending a school and the money we payed went towards helping them. So every little bit helps not just us but with a conscious effort others in need as well.Awards for Episode One and TwoWe are hitting the festival circuit with our first two episodes and have already garnered several awards.New York Independent Film Awards - Best Web Series - Monthly EditionOniros Film Festival - Best Web Series - Monthly EditionFestigious Film Festival - Best Web Series - Monthly EditionIndie Film Fest - Outstanding Achievement Web & New MediaIndie Film Fest - Winner - Best Original Song ""Night Lies""We are also in the official selection for the Valley Film Festival in August, 2020 which is a fitting venue since we filmed mostly in the San Fernando Valley. Hopefully we will be in a better place with everything then to have a live screening. What We Need & What You GetWe are aiming high and shooting for quality.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>THE WHAT</h2><p>“<strong>Ensemble</strong>” is a fast-paced, character-driven, half-hour, student television <strong>comedy</strong> mini-series that highlights the complexity and hilarity of <strong>college conservatory theatre</strong>.</p><p>From tyrannical directors, to the pressure cookers of working together to make a 24-hour play festival happen, to staging an original rap musical, this show explores nuance and gut-busting irony of the shows within a show - all set to original CLASSIC ROCK music.</p><p>Faster-paced and less self-deprecating than Glee, and less cheesy and more self-aware than High School Musical. Think <strong>mockumentary-style confessionals</strong> with college students, and a stage not big enough for all of them.</p><p> </p><h2>THE WHY</h2><p>“Ensemble” was created by <strong>Comedy Television Writers of USC</strong>, a student organization dedicated to creating a half-hour comedy writers room environment and producing student-made television work. The team comes from various schools within USC: the <u>School of Cinematic Arts</u>, the <u>School of Dramatic Arts</u>, and the <u>Thornton School of Music</u>.</p><p> </p><p>With Ensemble, the team hopes to create meaningful, collaborative, comedy-driven content and further the creative education received at USC, past the walls of a classroom. We are devoted to <strong>writing characters of diversity</strong>–from various racial, ethnic, religious, and sexual backgrounds–and sharing our love for the visual and performing arts. “Ensemble” is a <strong>love letter to the theatre community</strong>, and we hope to bring the heart, humor, and inclusiveness of this community to a television audience.</p><p> </p><h2>THE HOW</h2><p>We are shooting Episodes 4, 5, and 6. To cover our production costs for industry-standard cameras, lighting, and sound equipment, and support our incredibly dedicated and hardworking cast and crew, <strong>we need your help</strong>!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514957755/yahrc036i5m9xjg7hvx0.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Everything</strong> we receive on this page will go towards building the world of ""Ensemble""! We are producing <strong>more</strong> content <u>than any other School of Cinematic Arts student production has done before</u>. <strong>With any extra funds</strong>, we’ll be able to submit to festivals (like the Student Emmys!) and keep the show going past its completion.</p><p><strong>Thank you so much</strong> for helping ""Ensemble"" be the best show it can be and seeing the series through to the end!</p><p> </p><h2>THE WHO</h2><p>Our main AND supporting cast includes students from USC’s School of Dramatic Arts.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514957428/bmtbxgnbtub6lf2crqpt.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>And here are some of the people working behind-the-scenes to bring this project to life:</p><p> </p><p><strong>Mary Bronaugh (Creator/Showrunner)</strong> is a B.F.A. Writing for Screen and Television student at USC who loves to write and direct for student television and theatre, perform improvisational comedy, write poetry, and romanticize men she doesn't even know (which is to say, perform improvisational comedy and write poetry). She is the head staff writer and Co-Executive Producer of Puns for Ensemble, and her favorite parts of her job include being creatively smacked down by Carl Albert in the writers' room, responding by threatening to fire him, and cowering in fear and dismay as all of the other writers then threaten to overthrow ""this autocracy!"".</p><p> </p><p><strong>Lexie Chu (Lead Series Producer/Showrunner) </strong>cites all pre-2000’s Disney musical soundtracks as her life source. Other than aspiring to bridge the gap between theatre and film through producing, she adores voice directing and spending her free time watching more animated children's programming than she’d like to admit. She also runs a noodle review/enthusiast blog even though her parents have encouraged her to pursue healthier activities, like yoga to grow taller. Lexie currently studies Film &amp; Television Production with a minor in Theatre at USC’s Schools of Cinematic and Dramatic Arts.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Maya Vyas (Supervising Producer)</strong> is a middle child and a Writing for Screen and Television major in The School of Cinematic Arts. She was born in a small town in Ohio called Tipp City and bears an immense amount of pride for her Middle American roots (Seriously, she never shuts up about it.) As a child, Maya realized she wasn’t good at many things including, but not limited to, soccer, basketball, skiing, playing any instrument, dancing and professional croquet. These failures translated into writing and that is how she became who she is today. In turn, Maya would like to encourage failure. Not because you necessarily learn anything from it, but just because it would be funny.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Justice Schiappa</strong> <strong>(Supervising Producer) </strong>is a B.F.A. Writing for Screen and Television student at USC who got his start writing battle plans for his Star Wars LEGOs. A theater kid since a young age, Justice has a passion for performance and appreciation for all parts of the creative process including directing, writing, and costume design. He enjoys long walks to the fridge at 2 am while discussing what’s out there among the stars. His favorite thing to do on set is providing witty commentary that leaves everybody in witch-like cackling.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Elizabeth Keller</strong> <strong>(Producer) </strong>is an ex-theater kid who is still bitter about the way Glee ended, making her even more grateful for the opportunity to work on Ensemble. She loves sushi, stuffed bears, and bossing people around. She is currently studying Cinema &amp; Media Studies at the USC School of Cinematic Arts.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Carl Albert (Staff Writer/Associate Producer) </strong>got his start with the highest form of writing – fanfiction – and soon enough found himself excited by the prospect of filmmaking when he discovered the Oscar-nominated psychological thriller-drama, Marvel’s The Avengers. He seeks only to affect his audience with his work in a passionately emotional, and possibly even lover-like way, such as by making them throw up or pee their pants laughing. In his free time, Carl enjoys a good book, long walks on the beach at sunset, and hearing the cries of his fallen enemies. He is most influenced by the reincarnation of William Shakespeare, or, as his legion of fans known him, Mr. Worldwide aka Pitbull aka Armando-freaking-Perez, and his now iconic quote, ‘Big News, Pitbull, Tom Cruise, Mumbai.’""</p><p> </p><p><strong>Natalie Cohn-Aronoff (Staff Writer/Associate Producer)</strong> hails from Princeton, New Jersey, and has considerable experience with theatre, prose, and self-deprecating humor - which somehow landed her in film school. She is currently in the USC Writing for Screen and Television program, where she seeks to complicate the stories we tell with diverse characters whose lives are underrepresented on screen, relentless feminist critique, and an acerbic wit. Natalie can usually be found method acting extroversion, watching hockey, or weeping over Les Misérables. Though she is Israeli and American by citizenship, she’s a Canadian at heart. She hopes one day to be the first screenwriter-attorney-senator.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Becca Mann (Staff Writer/Associate Producer)</strong> is a Writing for Screen and Television major at USC. Never happy with the way books or TV series ended, Becca decided she wanted to be the one controlling the story, igniting a passion for writing. In addition, Becca is a member of the USA Swimming National Team and loves chocolate, traveling, pretending she can sing, and the ocean. She also published a novel two years ago called The Stolen Dragon of Quanx, which was a finalist in the 2015 IAN Book of the Year Awards.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Chasey Ridgley (Staff Writer/Associate Producer)</strong> grew up in Omaha, Nebraska and became enamoured with television at an early age, deciding to become a screenwriter. She is currently earning her Bachelor's of Fine Arts at University of Southern California in Writing for Screen and Television. She enjoys long hikes, writing, and dogs.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Anthony Sabatino (Composer) </strong>is an award-winning composer from Kansas, who graduated from Berklee College of Music with a dual major in Film Scoring, and Electronic Production &amp; Design with a minor in Conducting. He is currently a student in the prestigious Screen Scoring Program at USC and has worked on over 50 professional and student film, TV, video game, and concert works.</p><p> </p><h2>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h2><p>We understand not everyone can donate, but there are many ways you can help support the show:</p><ul>

</ul><p><u>Every bit counts</u>, and we will keep you updated with behind-the-scenes news every step of the way! <strong>Thank you ALL again for your support!</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495840211/fl20qotjqapnx0a9tj7g.jpg"" src=""""/></p></div>","THE WHAT“Ensemble” is a fast-paced, character-driven, half-hour, student television comedy mini-series that highlights the complexity and hilarity of college conservatory theatre.From tyrannical directors, to the pressure cookers of working together to make a 24-hour play festival happen, to staging an original rap musical, this show explores nuance and gut-busting irony of the shows within a show - all set to original CLASSIC ROCK music.Faster-paced and less self-deprecating than Glee, and less cheesy and more self-aware than High School Musical. Think mockumentary-style confessionals with college students, and a stage not big enough for all of them. THE WHY“Ensemble” was created by Comedy Television Writers of USC, a student organization dedicated to creating a half-hour comedy writers room environment and producing student-made television work. The team comes from various schools within USC: the School of Cinematic Arts, the School of Dramatic Arts, and the Thornton School of Music. With Ensemble, the team hopes to create meaningful, collaborative, comedy-driven content and further the creative education received at USC, past the walls of a classroom. We are devoted to writing characters of diversity–from various racial, ethnic, religious, and sexual backgrounds–and sharing our love for the visual and performing arts. “Ensemble” is a love letter to the theatre community, and we hope to bring the heart, humor, and inclusiveness of this community to a television audience. THE HOWWe are shooting Episodes 4, 5, and 6. To cover our production costs for industry-standard cameras, lighting, and sound equipment, and support our incredibly dedicated and hardworking cast and crew, we need your help!Everything we receive on this page will go towards building the world of ""Ensemble""! We are producing more content than any other School of Cinematic Arts student production has done before. With any extra funds, we’ll be able to submit to festivals (like the Student Emmys!) and keep the show going past its completion.Thank you so much for helping ""Ensemble"" be the best show it can be and seeing the series through to the end! THE WHOOur main AND supporting cast includes students from USC’s School of Dramatic Arts. And here are some of the people working behind-the-scenes to bring this project to life: Mary Bronaugh (Creator/Showrunner) is a B.F.A. Writing for Screen and Television student at USC who loves to write and direct for student television and theatre, perform improvisational comedy, write poetry, and romanticize men she doesn't even know (which is to say, perform improvisational comedy and write poetry). She is the head staff writer and Co-Executive Producer of Puns for Ensemble, and her favorite parts of her job include being creatively smacked down by Carl Albert in the writers' room, responding by threatening to fire him, and cowering in fear and dismay as all of the other writers then threaten to overthrow ""this autocracy!"". Lexie Chu (Lead Series Producer/Showrunner) cites all pre-2000’s Disney musical soundtracks as her life source. Other than aspiring to bridge the gap between theatre and film through producing, she adores voice directing and spending her free time watching more animated children's programming than she’d like to admit. She also runs a noodle review/enthusiast blog even though her parents have encouraged her to pursue healthier activities, like yoga to grow taller. Lexie currently studies Film & Television Production with a minor in Theatre at USC’s Schools of Cinematic and Dramatic Arts. Maya Vyas (Supervising Producer) is a middle child and a Writing for Screen and Television major in The School of Cinematic Arts. She was born in a small town in Ohio called Tipp City and bears an immense amount of pride for her Middle American roots (Seriously, she never shuts up about it.) As a child, Maya realized she wasn’t good at many things including, but not limited to, soccer, basketball, skiing, playing any instrument, dancing and professional croquet. These failures translated into writing and that is how she became who she is today. In turn, Maya would like to encourage failure. Not because you necessarily learn anything from it, but just because it would be funny. Justice Schiappa (Supervising Producer) is a B.F.A. Writing for Screen and Television student at USC who got his start writing battle plans for his Star Wars LEGOs. A theater kid since a young age, Justice has a passion for performance and appreciation for all parts of the creative process including directing, writing, and costume design. He enjoys long walks to the fridge at 2 am while discussing what’s out there among the stars. His favorite thing to do on set is providing witty commentary that leaves everybody in witch-like cackling. Elizabeth Keller (Producer) is an ex-theater kid who is still bitter about the way Glee ended, making her even more grateful for the opportunity to work on Ensemble. She loves sushi, stuffed bears, and bossing people around. She is currently studying Cinema & Media Studies at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Carl Albert (Staff Writer/Associate Producer) got his start with the highest form of writing – fanfiction – and soon enough found himself excited by the prospect of filmmaking when he discovered the Oscar-nominated psychological thriller-drama, Marvel’s The Avengers. He seeks only to affect his audience with his work in a passionately emotional, and possibly even lover-like way, such as by making them throw up or pee their pants laughing. In his free time, Carl enjoys a good book, long walks on the beach at sunset, and hearing the cries of his fallen enemies. He is most influenced by the reincarnation of William Shakespeare, or, as his legion of fans known him, Mr. Worldwide aka Pitbull aka Armando-freaking-Perez, and his now iconic quote, ‘Big News, Pitbull, Tom Cruise, Mumbai.’"" Natalie Cohn-Aronoff (Staff Writer/Associate Producer) hails from Princeton, New Jersey, and has considerable experience with theatre, prose, and self-deprecating humor - which somehow landed her in film school. She is currently in the USC Writing for Screen and Television program, where she seeks to complicate the stories we tell with diverse characters whose lives are underrepresented on screen, relentless feminist critique, and an acerbic wit. Natalie can usually be found method acting extroversion, watching hockey, or weeping over Les Misérables. Though she is Israeli and American by citizenship, she’s a Canadian at heart. She hopes one day to be the first screenwriter-attorney-senator. Becca Mann (Staff Writer/Associate Producer) is a Writing for Screen and Television major at USC. Never happy with the way books or TV series ended, Becca decided she wanted to be the one controlling the story, igniting a passion for writing. In addition, Becca is a member of the USA Swimming National Team and loves chocolate, traveling, pretending she can sing, and the ocean. She also published a novel two years ago called The Stolen Dragon of Quanx, which was a finalist in the 2015 IAN Book of the Year Awards. Chasey Ridgley (Staff Writer/Associate Producer) grew up in Omaha, Nebraska and became enamoured with television at an early age, deciding to become a screenwriter. She is currently earning her Bachelor's of Fine Arts at University of Southern California in Writing for Screen and Television. She enjoys long hikes, writing, and dogs. Anthony Sabatino (Composer) is an award-winning composer from Kansas, who graduated from Berklee College of Music with a dual major in Film Scoring, and Electronic Production & Design with a minor in Conducting. He is currently a student in the prestigious Screen Scoring Program at USC and has worked on over 50 professional and student film, TV, video game, and concert works. OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPWe understand not everyone can donate, but there are many ways you can help support the show:

<h2>Fathoms Below - The Gist</h2>
<p>Everyone has secrets that should be kept locked up and kept to the chest. Often we keep these secrets unsaid and kept to ourselves, never to be shared with anyone. But what happens if the secret is let out? For Kai, keeping her secret is life and death. Yet, she is very incredibly bad at keeping it.</p>
<p>What happens when four strangers from across the country, find each other, and bond over what should have been a well-kept secret?</p>
<p>Produced by Mya Stengel and Julia Stitely, Fathoms Below is a coming-of-age ICTV series that follows the adventures of Syd and Kai, freshman roommates as they navigate college life, and the ambitious biology professor Harris Hawthorne, all the while keeping the secret that one of them is a mermaid.</p>

<h3>Origin Story</h3>
<p>My name is STEVEN TSAPELAS. In 2007, I was one of the creators of the web series <i>WE NEED GIRLFRIENDS. </i>With my then co-producers Brian Amyot and Angel Acevedo we turned that small, homemade series into a YouTube hit, with millions of views every month and articles in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Yahoo News<i>, The Guardian Unlimited</i></i> and numerous other publications. It caught the attention of <i>SEX AND THE CITY </i>producer Darren Star who brought it to Sony and CBS, where it ended up becoming the first web series developed as a sitcom at a major network.</p>
<p>Producing that series was the highlight of my creative life. I am now asking for your help to produce another series that I feel just as passionate about --- a semi-autobiographical nostalgia piece called <i><strong>HOT N' NERDY</strong></i>.  </p>
<p>Now, if I ask you to picture ""Comic Con,"" what do you see? Big celebrities? Massive lines of eager people? Sneak peeks at blockbuster movies starring superheroes punching other superheroes? Absurdly attractive men and women cosplaying as nerdy characters?</p>
<p>It wasn't always that way. In fact, there was a time when merely mentioning the fact that you read comic books made you feel like, well, an outcast. I know because... I was one of those outcasts. I spent most of my young life obsessing over the details of my favorite comic books and sci-fi movies, feeling as though the world would never accept my fringe interests. Back then, I never would have imagined that one day my interests would not only be accepted but <strong>mainstream</strong>, with comic conventions packed to the gills by people of all ages and genders --- and with movies starring a few of my favorite characters becoming some of the biggest of all time.</p>
<p>In 2014, I began to reflect on that time in my life. I had not only reached an age where I was considered kind of normal . So, I wrote a pilot script titled <strong>HOT N' NERDY</strong>. I submitted it to the <i>Austin Film Festival</i> and to my great honor, it was accepted into the competition. It's a story that I have always wanted to tell and now I think I have found the form in which I can do it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524918279/kp7fpxxdwgpbytslgzwm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>HOT N' NERDY</strong> is set in the year 2000. It follows two best friends <strong>--- </strong>the sweet and socially awkward<strong> ALAN </strong>and the blissfully unaware <strong>PHIL</strong>. They hang out at dingy comic conventions held in basements and backrooms which are sparsely populated by awkward young men. That is, until, they meet <strong>BECKY</strong>, a rebel, a trendsetter and the first female they've ever seen at a comic book convention. Becky ends up taking pity on these two dateless nerds and gives them a <i>She's All That-</i>style make-over in order to prepare them for what is coming their way --- a world in which nerds are cool.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The plan is to film this <strong>July</strong> and then complete post-production by this fall, with the end goal being turning this into an ongoing series which chronicles the lives of comic convention nerds from 2000 all the way through present day.</p>

<h3><i>Music:</i></h3>
<p>We have secured the rights to use music from the popular Long Island ska band <strong><i>Step Lively</i></strong>'s 1998 debut album <i>The Trigger Effect</i>.

I'm incredibly excited to have their music featured in this! </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>We need enough funds for crew, equipment, locations and set-builds. The perks we are offering are unique and fun --- such as a VHS and personal comic books from my collection. But there are also real opportunities to be involved, with many producer credits</p>
<p>If we don't reach out entire goal, we will reconvene to see how much of the shooting script we can keep intact. If we go above and beyond our entire goal, we can film more episodes of <strong><i>Hot N' Nerdy</i></strong><i>.</i></p>

<p>Every dollar helps and every social media share helps. Please, please, please share this with your friends and family on Facebook, MySpace, AOL Instant Messenger, that one with the blue bird, Insta-whatever and wherever else you can think of!</p>

Now, if I ask you to picture ""Comic Con,"" what do you see? Big celebrities? Massive lines of eager people? Sneak peeks at blockbuster movies starring superheroes punching other superheroes? Absurdly attractive men and women cosplaying as nerdy characters?
It wasn't always that way. In fact, there was a time when merely mentioning the fact that you read comic books made you feel like, well, an outcast. I know because... I was one of those outcasts. I spent most of my young life obsessing over the details of my favorite comic books and sci-fi movies, feeling as though the world would never accept my fringe interests. Back then, I never would have imagined that one day my interests would not only be accepted but mainstream, with comic conventions packed to the gills by people of all ages and genders --- and with movies starring a few of my favorite characters becoming some of the biggest of all time.
In 2014, I began to reflect on that time in my life. I had not only reached an age where I was considered kind of normal . So, I wrote a pilot script titled HOT N' NERDY. I submitted it to the Austin Film Festival and to my great honor, it was accepted into the competition. It's a story that I have always wanted to tell and now I think I have found the form in which I can do it.

HOT N' NERDY is set in the year 2000. It follows two best friends --- the sweet and socially awkward ALAN and the blissfully unaware PHIL. They hang out at dingy comic conventions held in basements and backrooms which are sparsely populated by awkward young men. That is, until, they meet BECKY, a rebel, a trendsetter and the first female they've ever seen at a comic book convention. Becky ends up taking pity on these two dateless nerds and gives them a She's All That-style make-over in order to prepare them for what is coming their way --- a world in which nerds are cool.

 
The plan is to film this July and then complete post-production by this fall, with the end goal being turning this into an ongoing series which chronicles the lives of comic convention nerds from 2000 all the way through present day.

Music:
We have secured the rights to use music from the popular Long Island ska band Step Lively's 1998 debut album The Trigger Effect. This music was an integral part of my teenage years, always playing in my car or one of my friend's cars and I was even lucky enough to go to high school with the band's drummer Mike Rubenstein. I'm incredibly excited to have their music featured in this! 

 
The Plan
We need enough funds for crew, equipment, locations and set-builds. The perks we are offering are unique and fun --- such as a VHS and personal comic books from my collection. But there are also real opportunities to be involved, with many producer credits
If we don't reach out entire goal, we will reconvene to see how much of the shooting script we can keep intact. If we go above and beyond our entire goal, we can film more episodes of Hot N' Nerdy.

Every dollar helps and every social media share helps. Please, please, please share this with your friends and family on Facebook, MySpace, AOL Instant Messenger, that one with the blue bird, Insta-whatever and wherever else you can think of!
Thank you for taking the time to visit this page! We are all SO EXCITED about this project!
 
P.S. Thank you to Brian Harnick for shooting the campaign video and John Perno for editing it!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

In 2019, Michael produced a 5-minute animated comedy short called “Pound Dogs,” which featured three dogs and their antics in a run-down city pound. In 2021, Michael pitched the idea to a group of his colleagues, setting in motion a full series pilot project. The production team consists of a group of driven and creative university students who have a passion for classic animation, comedy and, of course, dogs. The story follows a preppy Yorkshire terrier who ends up in the city pound with a bunch of zany personalities (the titular “Pound Dogs”), but in the end, finds her place among them as she comes to realize the other dogs are not all that different from herself, beginning her journey to become an integral part of her newfound, new-pound family.  With the help of contributors, the student team will be able to cover production costs, outsource freelancers in animation, composing and public relations, and ultimately, assist in making this project be as good as it possibly can be.</p><p>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</p><p>Our goal is $5300 CAD.

<h3>The Basics (aka Bethany and Jon)</h3>
<p>Hey everyone! Bethany and Jon here. Thanks for checking out our page! Appreciate the read. We don't want to drag this on, so let's get to it. Between us you have two writers, two producers, a director and an actress. The both of us come from different parts of the music world, Bethany in radio and myself from a record label. We love this project and after seeing all these dramatic shows about the music industry fail (Vinyl, Roadies, etc.), we wanted to bring it to the interwebs as a comedy. We love the concept, characters, locations, etc. and really need your help to fund the project. As you'll see, we have some pretty cool incentives in exchange for your donations so we hope you'll join us on this adventure (was that cheesy enough?).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<p>The first episode and everything we had shot over the last year (sizzle reel, short pilot, etc.) had been done for free with everyone, cast and crew, donating their time for a project they really loved and believed in. Our Jewish/Nordic guilt (if that's a thing) won't allow us to keep making these without paying the amazing talent behind it. <strong>BETHANY AND I ARE NOT TAKING A CUT.</strong> <strong>WE WANT NOTHING FOR OURSELVES. </strong>We love the process and really just want the best talent involved. We've priced it out and here it goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>For $6,000, we can shoot an 8 episode season.</li>
<li>Each episode, the money allotted will cover our sound guy, actors and any location fees we might incur as we're trying to use any cool locations we can for this. It'll also include any specialty editing that we need as we will be editing 95% of everything ourselves.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, we're going to use the funds we DO collect to cover as much as we can, be it 3 episodes or 4.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know not everybody has the ability to donate (and there are probably better uses for your money), but we want you to be a part of any success we have. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue sharing Episode 1. The more people that know about it, the more reason we have to continue making them and better chance we have of gaining more funding.</li>
<li>Share this fundraising page with the hashtag #Labeled. All it takes is a few shares and we could have our next episode covered.</li>
<li>Look out for any kind of opportunities to be extras. We're looking to film one or two days a month and can always use some extra bodies to either help with production or act as background extras.</li>
</ul>

We plan on showing our finished pilot to producers and companies in hopes that they'd want to finance the rest of the season.We also have a few stretch goals for this campaign if it is more successful than we anticipated.$5500 – Hire more animators$5750 – Hire storyboard artists for episode 2.$6250 – Live table read of episode 2.Additional stretch goals will be announced if the prior have been met. For more updates, check out our Facebook page, Twitter and Instagram.SPECIAL THANKSDana Lee Dorsa Bidhendi, Michael Randall and Alanna Vanderbaan (Animation and Colouring)Nicole Bell, Alex Cabrera-Aragon, Alex Nasson and Allan Turner (Additional Voice Work)Asia Aoki and Kai Pinkerton (Video and Technical Support)Leandra Vermeulen (Photography)Alex Boss (Audio Support)Elaine Jones (Videographer)Ramona Pringle, Sarah Shelson, Wayne Shipley and the TMZ (Production and Legal Assistance)Cassidy Allison, Dylan Campus, Toni Karan, Paige Peralta, Agnes Wong (Writing Assistance)James Nadler, Ken Scott and Henry Warwick (Concept Assistance and Editing)",8.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div>
<div><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Hi! My name is Swati and I am the creator of ‘We The People’. Moving to the United States offered me the chance to connect with immigrants from all over the world and I fell in love with their stories! I wanted to know more but all I found on the internet were serious, grim videos that made me sad. And of course, those stories need to be told! But I also wanted the fun stuff! I wanted stories that would make me smile and experiences that I could relate to. Being a filmmaker myself, I knew I had to tell these stories. That's where the idea of 'We The People' was born.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<p>As part of this project, I have interviewed people who’ve moved to the US from all over the world. Each of the individuals showcased have brought the spirit of 'We The People' to life, by making the invisible, visible. We are now in the editing phase and this is where I need YOUR help! With this campaign, I intend to raise the money I need to cover our post production costs, namely, editing, music, sound and marketing.</p>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>KYRA UNIEJEWSKI - VIDEO EDITOR</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518854828/isohzfybpqbuozdkqv7g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Kyra, pronounced like Tyra, the international supermodel, has previously edited videos for brands like Buzzfeed, Food Network and Playstation to name just a few <i>(and happens to be an immigrant herself!)</i>. Over the years, she has cut documentary, narrative and music videos. In her free time, she teaches swimming, pretends to play the ukulele and attempts to bond with her hedgehog, Quilson. Kyra is first generation Polish, and found herself relating to the ‘We the People’ project and it’s upbeat take on a pressing and current topic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>NOAH LIFSCHEY - MUSIC AND TITLE MUSIC COMPOSER</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518854847/laskkyeuvtccsmsk1fkw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Noah Lifschey is a seasoned composer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist with projects on major networks, film, and ads spanning from the Academy Awards and Joseph Gordon-Levitt to Google VR and American Idol. He received a Grammy Nomination in 2014 as well as a Mark Award in 2017. Noah's originally from San Francisco and was attracted to 'We The People' because of its down-to-earth and fresh way of looking at immigrants and how immigration to a new country affects real people's lives. He thinks it's a necessary counterpoint to this highly important issue that has a lot of negativity surrounding it these days.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>SWATI ALI - CONCEPT, STORY, DIRECTOR</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518855068/oxv6wzu5gjym8m95kqw0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That's me! I have over 10 years of experience, writing and producing fiction and non-fiction shows for television as well as the online space. In fact, I was one of the pioneers in the original web content space in India (I created the first 'made for internet' sitcom!) I've also had one of my short films screened at the International Film Festival of India. And I've been a journalist! The best part is that I am also extremely modest, as is evident in this bio! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, there you have it - two talented immigrants and one Grammy nominee…I think we make a pretty good team!  The three of us feel strongly about this project and its importance in the times we live in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The minimum amount we need to enable editing, sound, music and marketing is 25000 USD. Every dollar of this minimum goal will go towards the post production and marketing of this series.</p>
<p>Here is a pie chart with a breakdown of expenses:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518744592/k0avhqnkhzvg0vsmxvhb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The post-production expenses are divided into editing, music and sound engineering. The marketing budget will go towards applying to film-festivals, paid PR activities, online and offline screenings and showcases. Part of this budget will also go towards YouTube and Facebook marketing to drive awareness about the series.</p>
<p>My long-term goal for this series is to approach and work with outlets like VICE or NPR to expand the scope of the project to interview a broader spectrum of individuals (asylum seekers, refugees, Dreamers etc.) across the entire United States. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Want to Achieve</h3>
<p>The United States, throughout its history, has benefitted greatly from the arrival of new people…people who bring with them fresh ideas, energy and ambition. Think Joseph Pulitzer, Einstein, Elon Musk, Hedy Lamarr…But as we all know, that legacy is in danger today. There is an urgent need for a different, more positive conversation and this series aims to start that.</p>
<p>If that positive dialogue is something you care about, then I urge you to contribute to our campaign. Please tell your friends and your family about it; please post about it and share it with your networks!</p>
<p><strong><i>We can only be our most powerful as a community, as a country, as a world when everybody's voice is a part of the conversation.</i></strong></p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you are enabling the start of a new, constructive conversation on immigrants and their stories.</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the intended outcome of the crowdfunding campaign?</strong></p>
<p>The intended outcome of the crowdfunding campaign is two-fold: one is to raise money to pay the editor, music and sound professionals who put their heart and soul into the project, in addition to slashing their prices. The second objective is to market the series so that we spread the word as much as possible, get as many views as possible and get as many people involved in the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  What are you guys going to do with all this money?</strong></p>
<p>A:  There is a pie chart above that illustrates how we will use the money.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  Will any Perks go out before the campaign is completed?</strong></p>
<p>A:  No. All perks are sent only after the completion of the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  How do I tell you what T-Shirt size I need?</strong></p>
<p>A:  When the campaign comes to an end we will send you an email asking you what size you need.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Every project comes with its own set of unique risks and challenges. But we believe we have diminished risk by meticulously crafting our budget and building an accurate scope of the work - covering everything from editing, music, sound and marketing. Based on where we are, we are comfortable in stating that all perks will be delivered, on a timely basis.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments, please contact us on info@wethepeople.film. You'll find us most willing to engage.</p>

<h2><strong>A WISH</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Dan McNamara and I'm the creator of Wish Weasel.</p>
<p>I have over a decade of experience creating bizarre comedy shows and web series. My first project was <i>The Calderons</i>, a mockumentary about a couple that took care of handicapped robots, featuring Kristen Schaal as the art teacher.  In <i>Redeeming Rainbow</i>, Pat Byrne and I lived with a talking cartoon rainbow voiced by Kurt Braunholer, featuring Ellie Kemper as our neighbor. I've screened work in the New York Television Festival multiple times and created an original animated series for Channel Frederator called <i>The Bear, The Cloud, and God</i>.</p>
<p>I'm a talented editor, animator, and SFX artist and I have always been driven to make offbeat yet heartfelt alternative comedy content. I love films from the 1980s/1990s, like <i>Gremlins 2, Labyrinth, Howard The Duck, Big Trouble In Little China, Muppets Take Manhattan, Short Circuit</i>, and <i>Batteries Not Included, </i>and Japanese kids shows like <i>Ultra Man, Godzilla, Pokemon</i>, and <i>Dragon Ball Z</i>.  So I thought, what if Jim Henson and John Carpenter made a kids show like Robert Smigel's <i>TV Funhouse</i>? </p>

<p><strong>Hello! Hey! What's up?</strong></p>
<p>We are Broken Coconuts Productions. A team of comedy loving, self-starting Ryerson University students eager to create something original that boasts Toronto's unique, talented and flourishing comedy scene. Oh ya... and we want it to be *bleep*ing funny.</p>
<p>BleepingFunny 30 minute sketch comedy pilot that consists of five sketches, showcases comedians from across Canada and will be hosted by a local stand-up comedian. The final show will be shot in front of a live studio audience and will pieced together to create a kick*bleep* pilot that will be accessible on a digital platform.</p>
<p>We embarked on production in January, have spent the last 9 months to development and will move into production this fall. In order to make this project come to life we need your help.</p>
<p>Each sketch and the final live studio taping is its own separate production with its own sets, props, costumes, cast and craft services. It's not one production, it's six.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>So order to cover the costs of our production we need to raise $6000. This money will be put towards for things like equipment, transportation, set design, costumes, hair &amp; make up, props and craft services.</p>
<p>We appreciate every penny you are able to donate and we have a few things lined up as our way of saying thanks to all you generous donors.</p>
<p><strong>It Ain't Easy</strong></p>
<p>As full time students juggling school, work, internships and the production of a pilot episode, *bleep* gets tricky. On top of all that, every member of this team has volunteered their time and energy, putting 110% effort and working our *bleep*ing butts because we believe in the success of the show.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you are not able to donate, come out and support the final step of our production, the taping of our LIVE SHOW on November 10th 2018. Check out our Instagram and Facebook @bleepingfunny for updates on our show, details about our fundraisers and a whole *bleep* load of memes.</p>
<p><strong>The Extra Funds</strong></p>
<p>All addition funds raised from our Indiegogo campaign will be donated to Sickkids Foundation. Our mission is to make people laugh and if we can, we want to help those who have a harder time being able to embrace and enjoy life's sillyness.</p>

It Ain't Easy
As full time students juggling school, work, internships and the production of a pilot episode, *bleep* gets tricky. On top of all that, every member of this team has volunteered their time and energy, putting 110% effort and working our *bleep*ing butts because we believe in the success of the show.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are not able to donate, come out and support the final step of our production, the taping of our LIVE SHOW on November 10th 2018. Check out our Instagram and Facebook @bleepingfunny for updates on our show, details about our fundraisers and a whole *bleep* load of memes.
The Extra Funds
All addition funds raised from our Indiegogo campaign will be donated to Sickkids Foundation. Our mission is to make people laugh and if we can, we want to help those who have a harder time being able to embrace and enjoy life's sillyness.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Pale Horse is the culmination of the time I've spent at Loyola Marymount working towards my MFA. I've been writing it in one form or another for the better part of two years. Finally, the time has come to try to take my words, and to bring them to life onscreen with a terrific cast and dedicated crew.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>There's still a lot left to pay for before I can finish shooting my project. Some of the expenses left to cover are as follows:</p>
<p>-Locations: I needed to find a diner for two days of my shoot. I have my eye on a standing set at a studio nearby, but rental fees total well over $1000 a day. At another location, I have to hire a Police Officer to direct traffic so we can safely shoot on a residential side street.</p>
<p>-Special Effects: I'm building a system of compressed air and plastic tubing in order to simulate gunshot effects for a shootout between several of my characters. I'm also hiring a stunt coordinator to help choreograph and safely execute this sequence.</p>
<p>-Catering and Craft Services: Most of my crew members and cast are helping me on a volunteer-basis. The least I can do is make sure they're well-fed.</p>
<p>-Costumes, Props, and Makeup: From futuristic weaponry and military-style cargo pants to customized contact lenses and temporary tattoos, it isn't cheap to sell a world and make it look good.</p>
<p>And much more besides all that!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When it comes to making a short film, in my experience there's always something you weren't able to plan for. Maybe an actor gets sick at the last minute. Maybe the truck gets caught on a low-hanging tree branch and is delayed reaching the location. Gear can fail, effects can be lackluster, costumes can look too costume-y. </p>
<p>However, at present I have over 40 filmmaking projects under my belt. I know how to prepare  and plan, where to save money and where to spend extra to ensure quality. I believe that I am particularly well-qualified to take on an ambitious project like the one I'm in the midst of planning.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word! The best way for people can find out about the project is by hearing from people already excited to see the finished product!</p>

<p><i>Money. (Season 2)</i></p>
<p><i>Weed.  (Season 3)</i></p> <p>Our story follows the journey of, Brian, a 20- something  Brooklyn based comedian who appears to have a magnetic attraction to shenanigans as he pursues sex, money, and drugs. The pilot season, PUSSY, focuses on Brian’s pursuit for a new love interest after things go south with his ex-girlfriend. He is supported by friends Quincy, a happy-go-lucky frat bro still trying to use college techniques to maneuver through life, and Jade, a natural cynic who seems to be questioning her choice of friends after each situation. All of this creates an environment for Brian to convert his hijinks into great source material for his debut comedy special.</p>

<p>Both wiry and energetic Brian is in the midst of the struggle of a starving artist in New York City, nevertheless he maintains an upbeat attitude. His struggle with short-sighted decision making is often the catalyst for the situations he gets himself into as he miscalculates the domino effect of his motives and actions.</p>

<p>Happy go-lucky black frat bro now outside of the college environment still using the tools from his glory days to traverse the streets of New York.

<p>A New York transplant from Houston. Witty, sarcastic, and cynical, Jade is treated by Quincy and Brian as one of the guys. She often serves as the voice of reason in a situation, and for this reason can go unnoticed. </p> <p><strong>WHAT DO WE NEED?</strong></p>
<p>We are looking to shoot this spring and need your help to make it happen. With three episodes complete and ready to go, six “after-the-show” segments in post-production, and our last three scripts of season one being finalized, all we need is a few more coins (we will take bitcoin!)

<p>PITCH, PITCH, PITCH! We are creating this pilot season package in hopes of getting  picked up by a digital media who are seeking and in need of diverse and hilarious content. Once picked up, we will have the funding to continue on with the development and production of the second season entitled ""Money,"" which follows Brian as he looks to find creative ways to fight off poverty and support his lifestyle as an artist in NYC and the third season, ""Weed,"" depicting Brian’s experiences with getting high and interacting with the very unfamiliar world of drugs.</p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLANGES</strong></p>
<p>Brian is a passion project for one of our writers. His life experiences really has been worthy of a show. This parallelism between the main character and our own writer has created a family of believer, supporters, and encouragers who are dedicated to making this happen. We each bring different yet important strengths to the table. Any challenges that may arise (we work in production- it is bound to happen) we have no doubt that the flexibility, determination, and ability to problem solve will make the vision a reality- especially if we get the funding we need. Fund us and we WILL deliver.</p>

Both wiry and energetic Brian is in the midst of the struggle of a starving artist in New York City, nevertheless he maintains an upbeat attitude. His struggle with short-sighted decision making is often the catalyst for the situations he gets himself into as he miscalculates the domino effect of his motives and actions.
QUINCY 

Happy go-lucky black frat bro now outside of the college environment still using the tools from his glory days to traverse the streets of New York. Often able to get through situations on charm alone, he finds himself interjecting with ditzy remarks in conversations with his friends Jade and Brian.
JADE

A New York transplant from Houston. Witty, sarcastic, and cynical, Jade is treated by Quincy and Brian as one of the guys. She often serves as the voice of reason in a situation, and for this reason can go unnoticed.  WHAT DO WE NEED?
We are looking to shoot this spring and need your help to make it happen. With three episodes complete and ready to go, six “after-the-show” segments in post-production, and our last three scripts of season one being finalized, all we need is a few more coins (we will take bitcoin!)

Crew/Cast Catering
Transportation
Coloring
Sound Engineering
Post-Production

WHY US?
With shows like Insecure, Atlanta and Fresh Off The Boat spearheading this current ""diverse"" Television Renaissance - The normalcy and day-to-day tales of people of color is finally showing itself to be worthy and necessary content.

PITCH, PITCH, PITCH! We are creating this pilot season package in hopes of getting  picked up by a digital media who are seeking and in need of diverse and hilarious content. Once picked up, we will have the funding to continue on with the development and production of the second season entitled ""Money,"" which follows Brian as he looks to find creative ways to fight off poverty and support his lifestyle as an artist in NYC and the third season, ""Weed,"" depicting Brian’s experiences with getting high and interacting with the very unfamiliar world of drugs.
RISKS AND CHALLANGES
Brian is a passion project for one of our writers. His life experiences really has been worthy of a show. This parallelism between the main character and our own writer has created a family of believer, supporters, and encouragers who are dedicated to making this happen. We each bring different yet important strengths to the table. Any challenges that may arise (we work in production- it is bound to happen) we have no doubt that the flexibility, determination, and ability to problem solve will make the vision a reality- especially if we get the funding we need. Fund us and we WILL deliver.",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2>Welcome to Bike Pals!</h2>
<p>We can't wait to share more of our beloved project with you. This project is based on some true stories from being 13, and some very very silly fictional ones. We hope you enjoy our clip and info, and we want to <strong>thank you</strong> for taking interest in our weird story!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>All Kip wants is to stay 13 forever, ride her bike, solve mysteries with her friends, and be noticed by her successful mom Wendy who reports on high profile crime. Instead she feels like she’s losing all of her friends to teenage-hood, her overly sensitive big brother is always picking on her, and her other stay-at-home bohemian parent Didi couldn’t be less similar to her. The story begins when Kip comes face to face with what lurks in their creepy town, something that's been there all along... real crimes. Torn between childhood and adolescence, Kip struggles to keep playing pretend, or to grow up with her friends, but little does she know she’s closer than anyone to solving the towns recent disappearances. </p>
<p>Bike Pals is a parody of shows like Stranger Things, E.T., and Stand by Me. Stereotypes are flipped on their heads in Bike Pals. It will make you laugh with its absurd physical comedy and characters, all while showing you vulnerability and truthful experiences of bravery with getting older, coming out, and standing up to actual murderers. Laughter means there is trust, and once there is trust, you can touch someone deeply, and that is exactly what Bike Pals does through a roller coaster of meaningful human experiences, connections, and relationships.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
</div><div>
<p>This story shows atypical characters and pushes gender stereotypes. This is an integral direction for media/cinema moving forward. Film and tv is saturated with stereotypes, which are the way children and adults form perceptions of themselves and people different from them. Women can be masculine, men can be feminine, and anywhere in between. Non-binary people can also express themselves in whatever way they choose. It is important for the media to have space for stories with different and new characters, because that is how tolerance, acceptance, and innovation grow. Affirmative action means making space that wasn’t previously there, and our series Bike Pals creates space for racial, gender, age, and sexual diversity while telling an absurd story about growing up and solving a real murder mystery. Bike Pals is unique and tells the story about growing up in a way that’s never been done, and through character’s that aren’t always seen.</p>

 These are just a handful of narrative and subjective questions our interviewees will have to answer on the spot for your viewing pleasure, and whether you agree with them or not is totally up to you! What will you be supporting?Essentially, we're aiming to shoot this project in September ready for a quick release at the end of October, with the hope that if this becomes successful, we can provide more content for you! Any money raised will contribute to various production and technical costs. Specifically, any support you're willing to give will go towards:
Set Design (the more money we have to play with, the better set will look!
Sound Recording (we want only the best quality sound for your ear drums)
Transport (less exciting I know... but unfortunately, none of us have the superhero abilities to fly or teleport)
 To give you a greater understanding of how we wish to design our set, we've created these concepts for you too see which can be found at the top of the page too alongside a narrated video explaining in further detail! Ultimately, this project is about fans, by fans, and for fans - so any money you'd be willing to spare towards our project would be greatly appreciated either in pure donation or by taking advantage of our perk bundles! Thank you! Risks:- As our team is formed of Master's students we do ask for patience, we are all still in the process of learning, but what we lack in experience we certainly make up for in passion and we will do our hardest to fulfil our promises and provide an entertaining viewing experience.- COVID-19 has disrupted the very fabric of existence in every sector across the world, as such we are not immune to the impacts either, we are currently working incredibly hard on working to adapt to this crisis and create a safe and secure shooting environment that adheres to safety guidelines.- Rewards are mostly digital, but for those who are backing us for some of our physical rewards, we will ensure everything is in great condition and shipped to you as soon as we can.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>So that's who we are. Now a little on what we're doing and why we need your help.</p>
<h3>What's this about anyway? I'm late for hot yoga class!</h3>
<p>Our latest opus is an idea for a  show called <strong>Hustle</strong>. We'd like to shoot a five-minute minisode that could then be sold as a multi-camera, single-camera, or even a digital series for the web. </p>
<p><strong>Hustle</strong> is the story of the three-generation family that runs The Rosen Agency in Hollywood (technically Koreatown, but they always say Hollywood). It's an agency that screams for modernization from the desks to its client list. It's basically a modern version of <i>Broadway Danny Rose</i>. It stars Dan Rosen Sr. (70s), a maverick agent from the 1970s who ran fast and loose with the morality of signing top-tiered talent. Dan Rosen Jr. (40s), his son, now the face of the agency and recently-divorced eternal optimist who truly believes that anyone, and we mean anyone, with the right opportunity can be the next A-List client on their roster. And then there's Dan Jr.'s daughter, Danielle (20s), a millennial with a purpose, which is to at least get the agency a functioning web site and working email account while trying to keep her father out of trouble. Dan Jr. is constantly pulled between his father's traditional (borderline-conniving) work ethos and his daughter's new-age (borderline-confusing) approach. But in the end, the Rosens always find a way to pull together in tough times, find their actors work, and (just barely) keep the lights on.    </p>
<p>Once completed, this five-minute short will then be pitched to networks, entered into Festivals, and shown to everyone and anyone who can help make this dream a reality.</p>
<p>In helping us to produce the <strong>Hustle</strong> minisode, you will be helping two guys who have the talent and the ambition to make this a reality, while contributing to making something special that you can totally take credit for years from now and we'll never know. We know what we're doing. We've done it already. And now, we simply need your help.</p>

<h3>Where your hard-earned scratch goes and what you get in return.</h3>
<p>When we produced ""Newsers,"" it was a 14-minute short that cost us $25,000, that was completely self-financed.  We had amazingly talented people work on it and shot at incredible locations,  and guess what, it showed. When we premiered it at the New York Television Festival everyone kept remarking how professional it looked, sounded, and was edited. We want to replicate that experience. Which is why, after consulting with our producer and director that $7,000 will fulfill all of our directives to produce a high-quality, memorable video. This stuff ain't cheap folks. Yeah, I know, ""But iPhones have video cameras!"" and ""My sister-in-law knows a guy who shot a whole movie for like $400 in his backyard!"" Well, good for him, and I bet it sounded and looked like shit. To get the attention of network executives and the public at large, a web series or pitch video needs to be beyond reproach. We need to show that we know what we're doing and most important, we have the taste level that succeeds in today's highly-competitive television landscape. And we do. So, $7,000 it is.</p>
<p>The funds will be spent on a One-Day Shoot in Los Angeles and will include:</p>
<p>Cast • Location(s) • Director • Producer • Minimal Crew (Grips, PAs) •  Rental Equipment (Lights, Sound equip., Digital backup) • Props • Catering • Editing • Insurance • LA Film License • Script Supervisor </p>

<p>Our modern world is so full of division, anger, hatred and pain. Our common response to pain &amp; adversity is 'fight or flight'. But at Panacea, a non-profit media company, we are doing the opposite, by showing the power of confronting pain with an open heart. </p>
<p>In December, we've been rolling out 31 daily videos around these narratives—all of which share Baltimore stories of empathy, healing and human connection. These stories can inspire others to find healing and transformation in themselves.  Throughout this campaign we have learned that these stories truly do inspire others to find deep healing and transformation in themselves -- and we have so many testimonials and comments that confirm this.</p>
<p>In our first video, a Baltimore resident named Hekima Amiri apologized to his son for not being in his life, and for being in prison for so many years.  In the first two days of its release, Hekima’s apology garnered <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/CIQtixwpkK7/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more than 110,000 views on IGTV</a>. Throughout the month, 1000s of people have commented with unadulterated support, while others have chosen to share their own stories, expressing newfound urges to turn their own resentment into forgiveness. </p>
<p>Through reposts, our videos have gathered over 1 million views—not just from Baltimore residents, but from people all over the country. The overwhelming feedback signifies the extent to which Panacea's mission resonates with others, and how much these stories of forgiveness and healing are needed in today's world.</p>

It's a validating experience, and whether it's through a real life individual or media representation, we believe that showcasing queer people as powerful and real individuals is important to help young queer folx accept themselves.Everyone Else:As much as we love our queer folx, we truly believe that the themes of this show: comedy, family, friendship are recognizable to every person, regardless of sexual and gender identity. Though the show is largely made by and for queer people, anyone with a best friend can relate to Ash and Oliver's journey, and the situations they find themselves in. There's banter and levity, and real heart beneath it - like any friendship worth having. We hope the audience becomes friends with these characters over time, as we've fallen in love with them all. IN CONCLUSION:We truly believe that Who The Eff Are These Guys? has the power to make real impact in the lives of queer people and their representation in modern media. We have a team of passionate people who have been working with little to no budget to even get this far, and who all want to come together to create something special and make people laugh. With your help, you can be part of that goal, and an invaluable member of the #WhoTheEff team.Thank you for your time, Note: This campaign is our second campaign. Our first campaign (Click Here) allowed us to bring on new people to the #WhoTheEff team, build our audience, and outline/script a full season of episodes, while looking into hiring Crew and organizing shooting schedules. Thank you for the funding thus far!",13.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2><strong>""The theatre beats me, starves me, and forsakes me... But I love it"" <i>Stage Door</i>.</strong></h2>
<p>I once told an acting professor, ""If I knew it was going to be this hard, I don't know if I would have done it"".  I was referencing the acting program that I was a part of.  It was my sophomore year of college and I was on probation in the acting program, and wasn't sure if I had<i> <strong>it</strong> </i>in me.  </p>
<p>This particular program started with 60 BFA acting students, and four years later only 18 of us graduated with that coveted BFA. Now, years later and working in Hollywood, I look back on that conversation and wonder: why? Why didn't I know how hard it would be? </p>
<p>It occurred to me, actors are payed to make us believe a story is real. There for, we do not talk about how HARD it is to make something look so seamless.  Actors don't want to share how many times someone told them their work was <i>shit</i>. </p>
<p>So I decided it was time to talk about it.  Time to show people all the work that goes into simply trying to be an actor.  </p>
<h2><strong>""Do It Better""  follows young actresses Carson and Lana on their journey through acting school; and all the pain + self doubt that accompanies it. </strong></h2>
<p>Their professor, Darren, pushes the girls past their breaking point over, and over again.  He demands honesty in the girls work, and is relentless with his tactics in bringing it out of them. </p>
<p>But how far will the girls be willing to bend over backwards to meet their teachers lofty expectations? How much will they give up in order to become everything they hope to be as artists? Everything is at risk-- friendships, jobs, boyfriends... even their own self respect. </p>
<p><strong>This series is a slice of life, and we know it will resonate with young artists everywhere.</strong>  It is honest, it is shocking... It's a peak inside an unexposed world. </p>
<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>We are lucky, we have a team of actors and filmmakers who have been motivated to make ""Do It Better"" since it was only an idea.  Because of the passion behind the project, we have been able to get access to beautiful cameras, amazing locations, and PHENOMENAL actors for a very small price. But there are somethings that will cost a pretty penny, no matter how we slice it. </p>

<h2>WE ARE SO CLOSE</h2>
<p>We are stretching every dollar as far as we can and already have two thirds of the funding we need to make this first leg of the series, but we need this final push to make it happen!  </p>
<p>You are not only giving a voice to artists around the world when contributing to this project, but you are creating a huge opportunity for WOMEN in the film industry.  We are a predominately female cast, with a female director, and have created  a piece where we talk about something other than dating! (Thats kind of a big deal). Bet that makes you feel good about donating, huh?</p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Being a female in the film industry is hard... it can be exhausting and testing.  And asking for the help to make this dream project happen makes me feel VERY vulnerable! But the actresses in this series, our director, and I are tired of waiting for projects that portray us the way we want to be seen in this industry. Making this series is a challenge in itself, but its worth all the reward. And I promise to use this incredible experience to keep fighting for a voice in this industry as a female and as a serious artist.  </p>

<p>What is Gym Life? Well, besides being an award winning comedy web series...It's a single camera mockumentary style show, taking a look at the culture and day to day inside of a small local gym as told through the lenses of three gym employees. Season one follows Terry, the over animated, over motivational, and overly personal, small time gym owner who hires a college student, named Helen, to join him and his grumpy right hand man, Josh, in making their gym bigger and better, or fail trying.  The group puts forth initiatives to improve the gym and interact with the diverse crowd that walk in for a workout.</p>
<p>Everyone who has ever stepped foot in a gym, accepted a free membership trial that they barely used or just walked by a gym has a story...that's how Gym Life was born. With the help of an incredible group of talented people we put together a series that aims to show you what really goes on in a gym in the funniest way possible.

<p><strong>""Love At First Site,""</strong> a romantic comedy web series. Synopsis: Julien is a young, hopeless romantic who spent his college days with his best friend Carmen. He always depended on Carmen setting up dates for him. After graduation, Julien moves to LA and becomes a Senior Talent Manager at an agency in Hollywood. There, he reunites with Carmen as she has successfully finished her internship and became a Senior Publicist for the same agency. Now, Julien’s lifestyle is changed in a way he isn’t quite used to. One day, when he scrolls on the Instagram app, he runs across a Dating App (hopefully Clover) where he matches with a beautiful girl. Unfortunately, that date turns out to be someone who’s he isn’t actually interested in, leading to Julien witnessing a revelation – he finally realizes that his true love has been sitting in front of him this whole time...</p>

<p>Help us get our show onto television! Normal People Explain Things to Me is a comedy series about an autistic family written from an autistic point of view. TV shows today with autistic characters are written by neurotypical people and don’t represent autistic people the way they actually are in their variety, and certainly they never portray autistic people from their point of view.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am an autistic actress and writer with 20 years’ experience in the industry. I created this show because I could not relate to the autistic characters I was seeing on television nor did they resemble autistic people I knew, such as the ones in my family. I aim to show the world the humanity of autistic people and create a very funny show that anyone of any neurotype can enjoy.  This will be the first show written from the autistic point of view on television.  My goal is to get this onto a streaming network or premium cable channel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To this end, I’m shooting a trailer next month as a proof of concept to network executives and to also attract a producing partner. And this costs MONEY. I’m asking for $10,000 but ANYTHING you donate will go to defray production costs, such as equipment rental, catering (I have lots of hungry actors and crew to feed), and post-production. I have so many people who are donating their time and talent to this project. I would love to be able to pay them.  But whether or not we reach the full amount I am trying to raise, we will shoot this trailer beginning on March 9. This trailer will be posted on YouTube and Facebook for public perusal. Like Normal People Explain Things to Me on Facebook!</p>

</div></div>","Help us get our show onto television! Normal People Explain Things to Me is a comedy series about an autistic family written from an autistic point of view. TV shows today with autistic characters are written by neurotypical people and don’t represent autistic people the way they actually are in their variety, and certainly they never portray autistic people from their point of view.
 
I am an autistic actress and writer with 20 years’ experience in the industry. I created this show because I could not relate to the autistic characters I was seeing on television nor did they resemble autistic people I knew, such as the ones in my family. I aim to show the world the humanity of autistic people and create a very funny show that anyone of any neurotype can enjoy.  This will be the first show written from the autistic point of view on television.  My goal is to get this onto a streaming network or premium cable channel.
 
To this end, I’m shooting a trailer next month as a proof of concept to network executives and to also attract a producing partner. And this costs MONEY. I’m asking for $10,000 but ANYTHING you donate will go to defray production costs, such as equipment rental, catering (I have lots of hungry actors and crew to feed), and post-production. I have so many people who are donating their time and talent to this project. I would love to be able to pay them.  But whether or not we reach the full amount I am trying to raise, we will shoot this trailer beginning on March 9. This trailer will be posted on YouTube and Facebook for public perusal. Like Normal People Explain Things to Me on Facebook!

All of the other sorority pledges seem to be fine with the hazing for the sake of the sisterhood, but Madison can't help but question if it's all worth it. As the sorority continues to play tricks and games with her mind, Madison's life becomes even more complicated when she learns that somebody knows her dirty little secret...

Boston also has that ""small town"" city vibe, since you can run into people you know wherever you go.

Because we will be in such close contact with the eye of the protagonist we're going for a look that represents both worlds, Madison's, which will appear in certain tones of color, and the world that everyone exists in, which tones will be adjusted. The palette of the sunrise will be representative of Madison's true self. While more harsh cutting colors, such as red, will emulate other scenes.""</p><p><strong>Director Sydney Rae Chin on the look of the Frances episode: </strong>""Dark but also times of color and warmness."" The dark, colder colors will be symbolic of Frances' facade and disconnection from emotion, while the warmness will symbolize her opening up herself to others.</p><p> </p><p><u><strong>v. the music</strong></u></p><p>We don't want to do what many college students and simply use royalty-free music, or worse, use music we don't have the rights do. Instead, we are collaborating with several independent musicians, many of them students, to produce soundtracks right for each episode. </p><p>Madison's episode is dreamy and hypnotic, representative of her drifting from a dazed mindset to total chaos during her pledging of the sorority.</p><p>Frances' episode has more darker electronic beats, jazz, and an overall, femme-fatale feel.

A final shocking reveal leads two characters to a dangerous dance near the edge of death.  ii. the characters(Charlotte Horan)Madison (played by Charlotte Horan) is a transfer from a Ivy League-like school who comes to Beckett University in Boston for a breath of fresh air. She wants to be a part of a social crowd, she wants to make friends, she wants to feel connected to others. Her desire for belonging leads to her joining a sorority. Diving into the pledge process, Madison soon realizes that being a part of this sisterhood bears a price. Madison struggles deciding if the in-group, tribal nature of the sorority is really what she wants in life.(Taylor Zavala)Frances (played by Taylor Zavala) is a neurotic, jaded upperclassman who feels stuck in Boston. She hides her emotions under a pair of sunglasses, which she wears almost everywhere. She holds up this persona of ""I'm too good for you and anyone else in this world."" However, underneath this callous mask, there is a deep vulnerability. When she meets Adam, she begins to finally open up and believe that she's capable of love again. But being vulnerable leaves Frances in new emotional situations she never some coming.  Supporting Roles from ""Hazed and Confused""(Anna Edwards)Krysta (played by Anna Edwards) is Madison's closest friend through the pledging process. She's comforting to the other pledges and extremely passionate and dedicated to join the sisterhood(Deanna Drennen)Sage (played by Deanna Drennen) is the sorority's ""It Girl"" who holds a lot of social power in the sisterhood. Sage puts Madison in a compromising position when she tells a fraternity brother to flirt with her.(Pedro Espinola)Rocco (played by Pedro Espinola) is a flirtatious fraternity brother who tries to seduce Madison as a part of a game with Sage.(Lauren Brooks)Annabelle (played by Lauren Brooks) is the sorority's biggest gossip girl. She's very dramatic and when she sees the opportunity to spill tea on Madison, she takes it. Supporting Roles from ""The Graduate""(Alex Hughes)Adam (played by Alex Hughes) is a graduate student living in Cambridge. He's charismatic, suave, and friendly. Frances is initially attracted to him because he's not a college undergrad. He's older, thus, hopefully more mature. While everything might seem perfect about Adam, he hides a secret that might send his relationship to Frances spiraling down.(Angel Perez)Benson (played by Angel Perez) is Frances' best, and only, friend. They frequent a coffeeshop to gossip over espresso. He's easy-going and non-judgmental, as he supports Frances even when she can be a bit impulsive.(Mika Wiley)Alex (played by Mika Wiley) is a free-spirit who Frances meets in an unexpected moment. iii. the worldJulius, James, Madison, and Frances all attend a fictitious liberal arts school in Boston, ""Beckett University."" The college is set in an urban landscape. Boston gives us a beautifully rich backdrop. We thought it was appropriate to set the story here because after all, it is one of the biggest college cities in the world. Boston also has that ""small town"" city vibe, since you can run into people you know wherever you go. For this reason, Beckett University and Boston can at times, feel like too much of a bubble for our characters, who want to burst out, explore life, and ultimately find out who they are. iv. the lookFrom the beginning of writing Dorm Dayz, creators Will D'Epagnier and Tori Fabio wanted to produce something raw, beautiful, dark, stylized, and honest. The initial pitch to fellow classmates was ""American Horror Story meets Skins."" We want to blend realism with surreal lighting and captivating editing.Director Taylor Zavala on the look of the Madison episode: ""Crisp but at times, unsettling. Because we will be in such close contact with the eye of the protagonist we're going for a look that represents both worlds, Madison's, which will appear in certain tones of color, and the world that everyone exists in, which tones will be adjusted. The palette of the sunrise will be representative of Madison's true self. While more harsh cutting colors, such as red, will emulate other scenes.""Director Sydney Rae Chin on the look of the Frances episode: ""Dark but also times of color and warmness."" The dark, colder colors will be symbolic of Frances' facade and disconnection from emotion, while the warmness will symbolize her opening up herself to others. v. the musicWe don't want to do what many college students and simply use royalty-free music, or worse, use music we don't have the rights do. Instead, we are collaborating with several independent musicians, many of them students, to produce soundtracks right for each episode. Madison's episode is dreamy and hypnotic, representative of her drifting from a dazed mindset to total chaos during her pledging of the sorority.Frances' episode has more darker electronic beats, jazz, and an overall, femme-fatale feel. The tone will change to more soft, mellow music as we get closer to the inner vulnerability of the character.vi. the budgetWhile we have access to equipment and other necessities, we still need your help to make this all possible! Much of our budget will go to craft services for our cast and crew, followed by our detailed and stylized production design/wardrobes. We need all the help we can get to make Dorm Dayz the best it can be!vii. the dorm dayz famWe are a collective of students, artists, young professionals, filmmakers, actors, and more than anything, storytellers. This is an independent passion project! We aren't submitting this for class assignment, though we hope to submit it festivals. We are here to tell a story that means something to us. (Will D'Epagnier)(Tori Fabio)Will D'Epagnier and Tori Fabio are Producers and the Co-Creators of Dorm Dayz. They met at Emerson College, became close friends, and late 2016, wanted to collaborate on a story. They both expressed frustration with lack of truthful storytelling when it came to college kids. Both of them being lovers of character-driven stories, Will and Tori wrote the Dorm Dayz series outline in less than a week. They were going to produce the project through a school organization, but ended up falling in love with the idea of independently producing it to increase their creative control. They have loved collaborating with friends and also giving opportunities to other classmates, including freshmen new to media production.(Taylor Zavala)In addition to playing Frances, Taylor Zavala is a Producer and the Director for the Madison episode: ""Her story is about committing to one's self while searching for a satisfaction that really becomes torture. I want to expose Madison's perspective through visual detail, pulling the audience out of the chaos, as Madison pulls herself out into a world that is all her own. With focus on a true, personality, I want to strip common tropes of their glamorized masks, creating an experience both stylistically enchanting and emotionally raw.""(Sydney Rae Chin)Sydney Rae Chin is a Producer and the Director for the Frances episode: ""The story I’m telling is one of loneliness and emotional distance. It just happens to have people of color in all the roles without making their identities the main plot point. I’m approaching it by emphasizing how hookup culture can make one feel lonely. Like the cast, our crew is mostly composed of people of color. It’s important that representation is changed within a white heterosexual male industry.""(Anna Abbanat)Anna Abbanat is a Producer for the Frances Episode and the Assistant Director for the Madison episode: ""One thing that’s really great about this project this project provides the opportunity for underclassmen to take on key rolls in the crew. This allows the underclassmen a chance to learn and develop their skills on this set. Often people forget that everyone starts somewhere. Underclassmen are just as capable and have been proving themselves valuable assets since the beginning of this project.""(Dan Nevins)Dan Nevins is the Director of Photography for the Madison episode: ""As the DP on the episode 'Hazed and Confused,' I️ am working closely with the director to create a unique and exciting visual experience. Through the use of colors and camera techniques, the nuances in the story will be reflected in a way people might not think. I️ think that we will produce an episode that speaks volumes!""(Dimitrie Flores)Dimitrie Flores is the Director of Photography for the Frances episode.(Izzy Kingstep)Izzy Kingstep is the Production Designer for the Madison episode.(Amaia)Amaia Rioseco is the Production Designer for the Frances episode: ""Our sets and costumes for 'The Graduate' are going to aim at being hip and stylish with the goal of representing the college students of today and their daily lives and struggles. I'm very excited to work on this set to get every detail to be what the character's lives would actually look like. The story is so real and relatable that the sets and costumes should match as well.""",19.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Modern Pioneering is the new show that fans of my show ""Wild Food"" have been asking for. Nearly all of the elements are in place to make it happen -- American Public Television is extremely excited about the show, the episodes are filmed, and a top-notch producer and crew are on board. I just need to raise enough money to pay for the distribution costs that will allow the show to reach U.S. households nationwide, giving free access to everyone regardless of whether they can afford cable or Netflix -- and your support can help make it happen! </p>
<p>If you believe in the importance of small businesses and learning to create with your own two hands, not just in your own life, but for our society as a whole, I know you will feel good about sponsoring this quality show. </p>
<p>The minimum goal of $30,000 will fund the closed captioning and distribution costs and get the show launched. We plan to deliver the show to American Public Television as soon as that goal is reached. The stretch goal of $70,000 will fund that plus 7 more episodes. Once these goals are met, the show will be accessible to everyone nationwide.</p>
<p>So many people have told me they are fed up with most of the lifestyle, travel, food and cooking shows on TV today. They are tired of all the extreme eating and contests, and they wish there were a show that reflected the way they really want to eat and live, that gave them inspiring and practical recipes projects and skills, for living a better life. </p>
<p>Modern Pioneering is exactly that. It's a show that hits the sweet-spot where inspiration and self-sufficiency meet -- filled with incredibly inspiring unsung heroes who are making the best with their own two hands and preserving traditions, all the while sharing useful tips, recipes, and knowledge that you can apply to your own life.</p>
<p>In each episode, I visit a community and meet their artisans, farmers and makers. In some cases I teach, in others I'm the student. I will bring you into my own home and garden as well to teach you my favorite homespun techniques and recipes. I will help you create ideas and solutions for a healthy joyful life.</p>

What started out as acquaintances working at a local beer garden in West Hollywood, turned into a friendship solidified over the love for expensive dinners, craft cocktails, and talking in depth about what it means to be a “starving artist.” Tales of struggle and surviving on cheese sandwiches and ramen. The blood, sweat, and tears. Let's face it; everybody loves a good success story, but real success comes from having that hunger in your belly, that drive that launches you forward to succeed. We had an idea based off this play on words and created characters who are unapologetically <i>not</i> hungry–they're well fed. Metaphorically and physically well fed by food, companionship, and, most importantly, the journey to find themselves.</p><p>We are inspired by shows like Broad City, Insecure, and Girls because they show us millennials breaking the rules and living selfishly and freely for their art. These strong, female characters give us permission to break away from traditions our parents were taught, like the nonnegotiable importance of having a standard 9 to 5, finding love and getting married before 30, and popping out a few kids, all before knowing who we really are and what we want to be: our identity. Times have changed, and social media makes us feel that everyone has their shit together.

<li>
<strong>$5,000: Cast and Crew Expenses.</strong> If we raise $5,000, we will be able to cover not only our “on camera” crew and their wardrobe, props, etc., but also our ideal “behind camera” crew and all of the additional costs associated with renting equipment, kit fees, and more.

Our biggest goal is to fairly compensate everybody involved for their hard work:)</li>

<strong>$2,000: Food and Beverage.</strong> We provide our cast and crew with breakfast, lunch, and dinner when they are on set with us. We will shoot 6-8 full days and require another 2 weeks of post production. We’ve got a lot of mouths to feed! </li>
<li>
<strong>$2,000: Locations, Gas, and Accidentals.</strong> You never know what's going to come up on set, and since we film in Los Angeles (where parking, among other things, is ridiculous), we want to plan ahead and make sure we are covered for any potential problems or challenges we may run into along the way. </li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000: Marketing.</strong> To spread our message, we need to get Well Fed out into the world! Having a full marketing budget would allow us to cover the cost of submitting Well Fed to film festivals and introducing it to bigger platforms. It would also support the purchase of business cards and other necessary items so that we can show Well Fed to as many people as possible.</li>

What started out as acquaintances working at a local beer garden in West Hollywood, turned into a friendship solidified over the love for expensive dinners, craft cocktails, and talking in depth about what it means to be a “starving artist.” Tales of struggle and surviving on cheese sandwiches and ramen. The blood, sweat, and tears. Let's face it; everybody loves a good success story, but real success comes from having that hunger in your belly, that drive that launches you forward to succeed. We had an idea based off this play on words and created characters who are unapologetically not hungry–they're well fed. Metaphorically and physically well fed by food, companionship, and, most importantly, the journey to find themselves.We are inspired by shows like Broad City, Insecure, and Girls because they show us millennials breaking the rules and living selfishly and freely for their art. These strong, female characters give us permission to break away from traditions our parents were taught, like the nonnegotiable importance of having a standard 9 to 5, finding love and getting married before 30, and popping out a few kids, all before knowing who we really are and what we want to be: our identity.
