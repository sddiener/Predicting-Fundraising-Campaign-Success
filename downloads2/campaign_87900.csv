<p>We are two sisters from Sweden who have been singing together our whole lives. This year we started a duo consisting of a mandolin and a guitar, together with our voices harmoniously intertwined. Annie has studied music for a total of 6 years, with 3 years of jazz, her theoretical knowledge has been essential in creating what we are sharing today. And together with Julia's deep studies of mantra singing, magic is created.</p>
<p>When we are asked about our sound, the most common reply is folk-pop mixed with mantras. Our intention is to re-arrange our favorite sanskrit mantras into a folk-music-style rhythm and melody. Together with this we are also sharing our own versions of some favorite ""conscious covers"" written by for example George Harrison and Eddie Vedder. During our tour, or what ended up becoming a tour, this year we discovered the impact our music had on our audience. The reason why our tour became a tour was for this reason, after our very first gig this year in our hometown of southern Sweden, invitations to share our music came and kept coming after each time we shared. In combination with us sharing our music at different festivals, we also noticed the importance of having some kind of recorded material to display for our future audience, a way of advertising ourselves beforehand. The value of having recorded material also became evident as after each concert we were asked about the possibility of listening to us without it being live. So, here we are now! To us this is a beautiful opportunity to reach out on a broader scale, we believe in our hearts that music can act healing, and this is also the innermost intention of why we are desiring to share it. If there is any way for us help the world by spreading more love through our music, then this is what we want to do - and we are hereby asking for your support :) </p>
<p>We are applying for 500 euros that will directly be given to a recording session in a good studio and as payment to the help of a few selected musicians that we believe can bring their own unique sounds to our songs. Our intention is to record an EP which is made out of the 5 songs that we have shared the most. If we do not reach this goal we still intend to record our music in the best way possible with the funds we receive. If financial support is not possible for you we would really like to encourage a sharing of our campaign on social media, networking or in any other way - we are very grateful for your support. </p>
<p>An abundance of love, light and peace to you all! </p>

<p>Ok so this is what I’m all about.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Firstly thank you for checking out my campaign. I massively appreciate your support. You are one of the reasons that this record will be made.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s been a little while since I released a body of work that isn't a single. My last EP Iconoclast was released a few years ago and since then I’ve been dreaming about releasing a full length record. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Behind the scenes I’ve been working away, trying to find a way to realise this dream. Crowdfunding was suggested by a few different folks but I guess I was a little too proud to give it a go. However, on looking into it I realise that its a way of getting something out there to people that actually want to hear it. Although I didn’t come to this decision lightly, I’m here now and I’m asking for your help. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I already know how this album will sound. I’ve written the songs and aired them on stage. I’ve demoed a few and tested them on musically minded ears. I’ve asked for feedback and it’s been good!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You guys will be the first to hear the finished product and throughout the promotional period I’ll be gigging up and down as I always do. I’ll also be playing your house parties too (check tier 3 to the right).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The music industry is a beast that is ever changing. Whether my approach is right or wrong I don’t know but I do know that I’ll be doing what I do regardless, until the end. I can’t do it alone though. I need a studio, musicians, sound engineers, producers and lots of other things that go into making a record. It’s expensive but of course worth it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your help I can get this record made and into your headphones. But this is not a one way thing. To the right you’ll see that there are lots of rewards I’ll be giving away in return for your support. I’ve tried to be as creative as possible with what’s on offer and I hope that you see something there that you want.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please share my campaign with your friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>I have been a vocalist and educator since moving to Nashville in 2001, when I graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston, MA. Life, as it is known to do, has taken me through amazing peaks and unexpected lows, and now I’m a divorced mom who really wants to continue to create but who doesn’t currently have the financial means to do so.</p>
<p>I teach part-time at several highly-regarded institutions in Nashville, including Vanderbilt University’s Blair School of Music, where I serve as Adjunct Lecturer in Vocal Jazz and as Director of the Blair Jazz Choir. I’ve been teaching at The Nashville Jazz Workshop and through my home studio for over 10 years.</p>
<p>This new project of jazz standards will be given life thanks to you and thanks to one of my biggest supporters, Angela Nuyens, who co-owns the Castle, a well-known studio in the Nashville area. She has graciously offered me 3 days of studio time, including the use of her engineer. She has even offered to babysit my son while I record! (She’s an angel.) I need to raise the rest of the money for the project, which will be recorded November 20-22 of this year.</p>
<p><strong>How much, and where does the money go?</strong></p>
<p>My goal is a minimum of $7000.</p>
<ul>
<li>$4000 for the instrumentalists (piano, bass, drums, and saxophone)</li>
<li>$1000 for the mechanical licenses (I’ll be recording other people’s songs)</li>
<li>$1500 for mixing and mastering (2 big steps for any recording project)</li>
<li>$500 for photography and other marketing expenses</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perks!</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">I’m offering some cool perks for those who would like to receive something for their donations. Perks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Names of ALL donors will be listed on my website (and lavished with praise!)</li>
<li>Download of the album for everyone who donates $25 or more. No physical copies will be made.</li>
<li>Voice lessons</li>
<li>French tutoring (my MA is in French!)</li>
<li>Copies of charts used in the sessions</li>
<li>Chances to be with me in the studio</li>
<li>House concerts!</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">I hope you’ll find something that entices you!</p>
<p>If for some reason I don’t reach my goal, I will either go ahead and record my project and delay the release, or I will reduce the length from a full album to an EP (about 5 songs). Either way, I’m very grateful for all the help you can give.</p>
<p><strong>How will this one be different?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been fortunate to record solo projects in the past, but none of them truly reflects the material that I perform and teach on a regular basis (traditional, straight-ahead jazz standards). My past projects (including “A Flower Truly Blue” and “Passage”) have garnered high praise from fans and reviewers alike, but the focus that this new album will have on traditional vocal jazz will enable me to market it more easily to jazz lovers and jazz radio, for example. This new project will serve as a collection of my “greatest hits,” songs that I’ve enjoyed singing live in jazz clubs and on stages in the US and Europe over the last 16+ years. I’ll be able to present it to my clients and students as a true reflection of what I do best.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you are unable to help financially, you can make a huge impact on my project’s success by sharing my campaign on social media (like Facebook and Twitter) or by sending an e-mail or just by spreading the word in conversation. Let your friends, family, co-workers and neighbors know, especially those who love jazz. Any help you can give is very much appreciated. Thank you!</p>

<h3>About Kable House Presents</h3>
<p>Kable House Presents is an independent, volunteer-driven initiative that showcases national touring acts spanning a wide variety of genres and styles in an intimate, listening-room environment. The organizers rent out the Philadelphia Street seating area at York, PA's Central Market about once a month and transform it into a music venue. General admission tickets are available to the public (price point is around $15), and food and beverages are available for purchase during the shows from featured Central Market vendors.</p>
<p>Since we launched in September 2014, we have hosted 36 shows that attracted 3,550 attendees. At this point, we're a well-oiled machine!</p>
<p>Kable House Presents provides an opportunity to showcase artists from early on in their careers and help them establish an audience in southcentral Pennsylvania.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What It Takes to Keep It Going</h3>
<p>Kable House Presents is currently volunteer-driven, and we have great partnerships with the production company who works on the shows; our expenses are lean. Still, ticket sales do not entirely cover the expenses, and we rely on support from arts and culture benefactors to bridge the gap.</p>
<p>It costs about $20,000 to host a season of 10 shows. We're looking to raise half of that through this campaign, and the rest through individual giving, corporate sponsorships, and ticket sales throughout the season. The more we raise here, the less we have to raise through more traditional means, and the more time and energy we'll have to focus on programming another great season of concerts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thanks for Being a KHP VIP</h3>
<p>We've put together seven giving levels and the rewards include Kable House Presents swag, tickets to shows in our regular season, and admission to our first-ever local music showcase.</p>

<p>It's me:  V. Shayne Frederick, your friendly neighborhood Jazz vocalist and pianist about town. Outside of my busy performance calendar, I've been working on finishing a record. What? A CD project? Yes! </p>
<h3>A CD Project!</h3>

<h3>Brief Performance Bio</h3>
<p><i>V. Shayne Frederick is a pianist, vocalist, arranger and musical director with performances spanning two decades. He has been featured at such illustrious venues as Minton's Playhouse (Harlem,) Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts, the Barnes Foundation, SugarHouse Casino, The Harlem Stage, Suzanne Roberts Theater, Resorts Casino, Valley Forge Casino, Philadelphia Clef Club for Performing Arts, South Jazz Parlor, World Café Live, Kelsey’s Supper Club in Atlantic City, and the African-American Museum in Philadelphia. He has also headlined the John Coltrane Jazz Festival, Center City Jazz Festival, Lancaster Avenue Jazz &amp; Arts Festival, Manayunk Jazz Festival (April 2019,) and the Piton International Film Festival in the Caribbean island of St. Lucia. Cited by the Broad Street Review as “one of the region’s busiest and best jazz singers,” and by All About Jazz as “one to watch” and a “shining light,” V. Shayne’s singular voice—with its dulcet texture and substantial range—has a classic appeal with a bright, innovative flair. </i></p>

<p>My name is Brian Clouthier and I am BESTMAN. Over the past few years I've found my musical voice writing and recording synthy pop music and with a group of talented guys, I've tried to bring that love and energy to the world.  The songs are ready, its time for the next step. I want to show you everything BESTMAN can be!</p>

<p>BESTMAN is my passion, plain and simple. This collection of music is incredibly special to me and it's important that these songs sound the best they can. I've tried to do everything on my own, but I've reached a point where I need help. Let's face it, I should have asked for help a while ago! Money has finally become a factor and I'm finally reaching out.</p>
<p>I found someone I trust with my music to take it to another level and that is a huge step! In order to get the next 3 tracks finished, I need to come up with some additional funds. It's a shame that finances are the only thing holding this back, but it's the reality. </p>
<p>It's difficult to even ask and takes some pride swallowing, but I've taken this as far as I can on my own. A small amount is going to make such a difference and the gratitude I'd have for your support is truly immeasurable. It might not seem like much, but it means the world to me and not having the funds to make this a reality is a constant struggle. A small contribution is not only a way to support art, but also a way to help someone follow their dream.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563426062/ptkwveapna4qnuswjsgp.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>I lucked out and found some great people to help bring these songs to life. Their fingerprints are all over the music and over time, what started as one became a band. Its an amazing feeling to connect with other musicians and an even better feeling to bring that energy to room of people.  Without them and without you, I couldn't do it.

<h3>Aliens(A), Tech(T) and Cool Music(Oh Yeah!)</h3>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  About 10 years ago these couple boys traveled half way around the world in pursuit of the American Dream.  Little did they know about the complete new world they are getting into, but were only super excited about their future in the country they have always dreamed of since their childhood. The Land of Opportunity and Land of endless possibilities, where your dreams do actually come true if you work for it.... (Fast Forward)</p>
<p><strong>T:  </strong>'Skinny is Green' (SIG) initially was a one man band when Rav started writing and recording songs in his ancient PC and music software. The Guitar was directly plugged into an interface and everything else beside vocals was made out of mouse clicks, including the drum tracks. It took over 3 years and that's how the first album 'Dreamers' was born.  The DIY aspect of the band had already begun in this era with Rav programming on his computer to create cool electronic  synth sounds behind the guitars and drums.  Another DIY album was released on Oct of 2016 called 'Watching me'. Music Videos for the songs 'Watching me', 'End of the Day'  and 'A Better Place' followed. Besides Rav and Punit being longtime friends, the idea of Punit joining SIG on Bass didn't happen until the beginning of 2017. In fact they didn't even leave a day out , the first show they played together was Jan 1st of 2017. (yay)</p>
<p><strong>Oh Yeah !</strong> : 2017 marked major changes in sound of SIG. They  started evolving more towards EDM/DUBSTEP direction than it had before and started experimenting during live shows.  With Punit's unique way of playing bass with  experimental modern tech gadgets  and Rav's programmed Synth tracks alongside his unique vocal  and guitar abilities they started pushing their old rock sound into something very different and much more upbeat . After touring around various cities in the country they were inspired by all the amazing people from diverse backgrounds and culture whom they interacted within the touring days.They came to realize that no matter who you are are where you came from, you might look different on the outside but deep down inside we are all the same. The only holdup came from within the ones mind because you always just wanted to stay withing your comfort zone.They quickly realized that music for these guys had become much more bigger than them and much more bigger that what they had initially thought. It had taken form of a Message rather than just tunes for them. Now the goal was just not making an album but actually amplify the message to pass on for massive outreach. Rav started working his magic on his ancient computers once again............ That is that  and here we are now !! Right here on Indiegogo.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>The Band is  looking for total amount of $5000 for costs including Mastering, Album Art, CD Duplication &amp; Packaging, Professional Promotion etc. Since SIG is  DIY  band they have already began recording process for songs for 'Look in Through me'.</li>
<li>Perks Include but not limited to T Shirts, CD's, Signed Posters, House Concerts and Rav's Cool Telecaster Guitar.</li>
<li>The band is already in the process of  filming a documentary  behind  making of the album which will give you an insight in the creative process the band goes through in order to create their art.  The USB containing video files along with some personalized messages and unreleased materials including pictures and some cool surprises will be mailed to you.</li>
<li>If the funding exceeds the  goal, it will be dedicated to  the additional funds for a Music Video project for one of the songs from the EP which we will  be of YOUR choice. We will host a voting competition to select the track with most votes and film a music video for it. We love sharing stories from all over the world and Music Video is one great tool for it.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're aware that this is a bumpy road we're riding on. Without a label and media support it's usually tough for indie bands like us to reach as many people as we would like to, even for this campaign.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Anthea Jaskirpal Kaur. Originally from Sydney, Australia, I have adopted Los Angeles as my home away from home. Since arriving in the US over 10 years ago, I have been a sponge for anything that would support me on the path of inner growth and consciousness.</p>
<p>Kirtan, chanting, or mantra repetition, as it's sometimes called, is one of the most effective tools I have come across to get us out of our heads and into our hearts. I have been chanting these mantras for many years now and it was fairly recently that I was bold enough to act on the inner calling to start sharing them. Never having played an instrument or sung before, it was a daunting task but with a lot of support and perseverance, this inner calling started to take over and bring me along on a magical journey of discovering hidden talents and blossoming into the musician I am today.</p>
<p>Along the way, I have played many concerts, yoga classes, retreats, festivals, collaborated with many musicians, even sung on other artists albums and explored other genres. And now I can’t believe I am making my very first album! </p>
<p>I created this campaign to raise funds to make this album. It's near and dear to my heart as I believe these mantras need to be shared. If even one person out there can receive at least a little of the joy that I have received from chanting these mantras, then it's all worth it!</p>
<p>Allowing the community in to support this project not only warms my heart but it's really the only way to get this album made. Let's do this together!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $8, 150 for phase one of this project. Two tracks have already been completed and this amount will help fund the remaining songs. Below is a breakdown of the costs. I have included estimates for each song and the funds needed for each. Writing, recording and mixing can cost anywhere between $1,000 and $1,500 per track. Mastering is around $200 per track.</p>
<p><strong>Phase One</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ra Ma Da Sa - $200 for mastering</li>
<li>Sa Re Sa Sa - $200 for mastering</li>
<li>Ong Namo Guru Dev Namo - $1,300 (incl mastering)</li>
<li>Guru Guru Wahe Guru - $1,300 (incl mastering)</li>
<li>Mangala Saaj Shabad - $1,300 (incl mastering)</li>
<li>Long Time Sun - $1,000 (incl mastering)</li>
<li>Electronic Mantra Track - $1,500 (incl mastering)</li>
</ul>
<p>Total - $6,800</p>
<ul>
<li>CD Production - First 100 CDs - $350</li>
<li>Album Artwork/Photography - $500</li>
<li>Graphic Design and Marketing for Launch - $500</li>
</ul>
<p>Total - $1,350</p>
<p><strong>Grand Total: - $8,150</strong></p>
<p>These are very conservative estimates. So I have created a stretch goal.</p>
<p>Stretch Goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital Distribution - $1,200 ($100 per month for first year)</li>
<li>Album Launch Party - $1,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Total - $2,200</p>
<p><strong>Grand Total Stretch - $10, 350</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase Two</strong></p>
<p>These are songs that have been written that I would LOVE to include on this album. So phase two is a mega stretch goal!</p>
<ul>
<li>Om Namah Shivaya - $1,300 (incl mastering)</li>
<li>Maha Mantra (Hare Krishna) - $1,300 (incl mastering)</li>
<li>Ajai Alai - $1,300 (incl mastering)</li>
<li>Aad Such Jugaad Such - $1,300 (incl mastering)</li>
</ul>
<p>Total Phase Two: $5,200</p>
<p><strong>Grand Total Mega Stretch Goal: $15,550</strong></p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, the funds will go to as many songs as we can get done, so it will still be very effective.</p>
<p><strong>Now What You Get!</strong></p>
<p>Besides my eternal gratitude, you have access to some amazing perks! Some of those are the album of course, tickets to LA events, playing music in your yoga class or workshop, and the most exciting is sending you the first two tracks right away when you contribute. This is quite rare but I didn't want you to have to wait!</p>
</div><div>Know that with your support, getting this music out to the world is our small way of contributing to the healing on this planet and to the peace in the hearts of all those who need it most.</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help me get the word out and make some noise about this campaign!</p>
<p>You can post on social media using the Indiegogo share tools. Or think of three friends who would like this kind of music and share the campaign link with them.</p>
<p>Thank you beyond words for your support! Let's do this!</p>

Digital Distribution - $1,200 ($100 per month for first year)
Album Launch Party - $1,000

Total - $2,200
Grand Total Stretch - $10, 350
Phase Two
These are songs that have been written that I would LOVE to include on this album. So phase two is a mega stretch goal!

Om Namah Shivaya - $1,300 (incl mastering)
Maha Mantra (Hare Krishna) - $1,300 (incl mastering)
Ajai Alai - $1,300 (incl mastering)
Aad Such Jugaad Such - $1,300 (incl mastering)

Total Phase Two: $5,200
Grand Total Mega Stretch Goal: $15,550
If I don't reach my goal, the funds will go to as many songs as we can get done, so it will still be very effective.
Now What You Get!
Besides my eternal gratitude, you have access to some amazing perks! Some of those are the album of course, tickets to LA events, playing music in your yoga class or workshop, and the most exciting is sending you the first two tracks right away when you contribute. This is quite rare but I didn't want you to have to wait!
Know that with your support, getting this music out to the world is our small way of contributing to the healing on this planet and to the peace in the hearts of all those who need it most. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Help me get the word out and make some noise about this campaign!
You can post on social media using the Indiegogo share tools. Or think of three friends who would like this kind of music and share the campaign link with them.

<p>One day, I was exploring my musical tastes at a rehearsal, when the bass player turned to me and said, ""<strong>You like Juicy grooves!</strong>"" It was at that moment that I knew what my next album would be called:</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;"">JUICY.</h2> <p>I've always known, ever since I was a child singing rounds with my family, that I wanted to make people feel good with my music. <strong>You're help in funding this album means more to me than I can express in words. </strong></p>
<p>The past <strong>2 years</strong> have been a whirlwind of inspirations, self explorations, and new friends. JUICY is a snapshot of my mind's current perspectives on love, loss, lust, confidence, sass &amp; vulnerability. Plus it's got juicy grooves. I hope it'll be as satisfying for you to hear as it is for me to create. </p>
<p>As a tween, my walls were covered in Britney Spears and Destiny's Child posters. At <strong>age 16</strong>, I got into jazz and found my own voice. I continued gathering musical influences throughout high school from good friends, crushes who made amazing mixed CD's, and old wise people like a trumpet player who wrote Ella Fitzgerald's name on a napkin and told me to listen. Today I'm heavily influenced by the stylings of Erykah Badu, Joni Mitchell, Lauryn Hill, and Betty Carter.</p>
<p>I always put some Olivia into everything I do, like my theme song I fit into my last <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSP7oJvbOSY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=181"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Postmodern Jukebox video</a>, and Juicy will allow my heart to explore my own creative visions.</p>
<p>I've always been a big dreamer. If the music is tight and the message is right, I want to light up your heart with my voice and songwriting too. That's why I'm making Juicy! </p>

<p>I've learned that the people in this community of artists are such pioneers of culture, living the artist life full of unknowns so that they can create and be the voice of the people.

<p>So far I'm incredibly lucky to have my team putting in their time and effort for free, knowing that I will be able to pay them back after this campaign. Right now I am making this album on friendship, trust, belief, and love! </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Production</strong>- $500 per track (estimated $5,000 for 10 tracks)</li>
<li>
<strong>Musicians</strong>- $1,200 (studio musicians, bass, keys, guitar, drums, percussion, horns)</li>

<p><u><strong>Total - $13,900</strong></u></p>
<p>I’m aware that this is more than the goal that I’ve set to reach for this campaign. Hopefully we can overshoot the campaign goal and fund the entire project!</p>
<p><strong>What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>Tons of <strong>AWESOME</strong> Olivia merch!!! I hope you have so much fun scrolling through the tiers and picking your favorite products to enjoy.</p>
<p>My personal favorites are the tote bag which I use for groceries, the phone charger which I carry everywhere and is a life-saver, and the coffee mug because, well, I love coffee! Fun fact- the music on the coffee mug is from a song I wrote that will be on Juicy! If you read music, maybe you can guess what song it is once the album comes out ? </p>
<p>I also love the T-shirt because it’s <strong>super comfy and cute</strong>, the <strong>notebook for songwriting</strong>, and the <strong>bluetooth headphones</strong> which I’ve taken with me on <strong>every tour</strong> and thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
<ul><li>This is an ""all or nothing"" campaign. I'm not one to shy away from a risk!  If we don't reach our goal, we don't get any of the money and I will need to pay everyone for their time and work out of pocket. Considering the fact that I would have to take out a loan to do that, there won't be any funds to move the project forward once I've reimbursed everyone for what they've done thus far. So essentially the entire project would fall apart. But I haven't thought about that because I'm not worried. I have 100% faith that we will meet the goal!</li></ul>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>Very simply, I've been writing songs for the last few years and I'm planning to record an album this Summer with your help. The timeline is tight and our personal finances to make this happen are tighter. In October, our family of four is moving overseas for a few months to lead a discipleship school in the Himalayas. For us, that means we are already reaching out to friends and family to help cover the costs associated with this trip. Now, I am looking to additionally raise funds to record this album that I've been working on for a few years. I personally think that it's all in the right timing, and that people will see the value in both. Feel free to read on and watch the video, but I want to extend my heart felt thanks for helping to make this project happen!<br/> </p>
<h2>The Concept of the Album</h2>
<p>The Garden EP is about my journey of discovering friendship with God. It's about discovering that there's a greater depth of relationship available than I thought at first. It's about discovering that the obstacles to this kind of relationship aren't on God's side, but are the ideas and beliefs that I'd chosen and believed. Truthfully, I hope people will listen to this album and it will demystify yet provoke  them to journey a little deeper into what it means to walk in friendship with Jesus.</p>
<h2>The Cost</h2>
<p>Project Cost: $9000</p>
<p>More than half of my fundraising goal will go to recording, producing, gear rentals, mixing and mastering. Also included in the cost is paying musicians and buying cds. The rest of the money is to have live videos of the live recordings. I want this project reach people more than I am trying to get income back from it, so I've chosen to hire some friends to help create live videos.</p>
<p>I believe in sowing seeds of investment and I encourage you to view this project as an investment opportunity.</p>
<h2>The Pitch</h2>
<p>Please consider making a contribution to this project, because you either believe in me, you believe in the vision, or you think our children are cute and you are in a good mood today :)</p>

<p><strong>Das Projekt </strong>(English version see below)</p>
<p>Bereits in meiner Jugend wurde meine Begeisterung für die englische Musik des 16. und 17. Jahrhunderts geweckt, die mit ihren fröhlichen Tanzsätzen, kontemplativen Pavans, mitreissenden Melodien aus der Folklore und Fantasias in kunstvoll kontrapunktischem Stil so viel Abwechslung bietet und den Hörer unmittelbar zu begeistern vermag.</p>
<p>Seit vier Jahren beschäftige ich mich nun schwerpunktmässig mit diesem Repertoire, dem auch meine Ende 2016 beim Label OehmsClassics erschienene Debut CD „Time stands still“ gewidmet ist. Die Aufnahme wurde von der Presse begeistert aufgenommen und war für den ""Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik"" nominiert. Durch die positive Resonanz zusätzlich motiviert, entstand der Wunsch, eine weitere CD mit Werken aus dieser Blütezeit englischer Musik zu produzieren.</p>

<p><strong>CD Project “From Byrd to Byrd”</strong></p>
<p>Postproduction &amp; Release</p>
<p>I am looking for backers to help funding my second harpsichord album “From Byrd to Byrd” which begins and ends with music by William Byrd, the most important composer of the English Renaissance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Story</strong></p>
<p>I have long had a particular liking of English music from the 16th and 17th century that immediately enthrals the listener with its joyful dance movements, deeply contemplative Pavans and Grounds in artful contrapunctic style. Within the last four years I have specialized in keyboard music from William Byrd to Henry Purcell. I also dedicated my first solo album „Time stands still“ (OehmsClassics) to this repertory. The recording has been well acclaimed by the critics (Early Music Review, American Record Guide, BBC Radio 3 „Record Review“) and got a “Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik” nomination. Motivated by this feedback I decided to produce another album with music from this “Golden Age”. More than half of this CD will be devoted to <strong>William Byrd</strong> (1543-1623). There will also be music by his contemporaries <strong>John Bull</strong> (1562/63 – 1628), <strong>John Dowland</strong> (1563 – 1626), <strong>Orlando Gibbons</strong> (1583 – 1625), <strong>Thomas Morley</strong> (1557/58 – 1602) as well as works by composers of the following generations (<strong>William Lawes</strong> (1602 – 1645), <strong>Matthew Locke</strong> (1621 – 1677) and <strong>Henry Purcell </strong>(1659 – 1695)).</p>
<p>It is my wish to contribute to making these great English composers be heard more often on harpsichord recordings.</p>
</div></div>","Das Projekt (English version see below)
Bereits in meiner Jugend wurde meine Begeisterung für die englische Musik des 16. und 17. Jahrhunderts geweckt, die mit ihren fröhlichen Tanzsätzen, kontemplativen Pavans, mitreissenden Melodien aus der Folklore und Fantasias in kunstvoll kontrapunktischem Stil so viel Abwechslung bietet und den Hörer unmittelbar zu begeistern vermag.
Seit vier Jahren beschäftige ich mich nun schwerpunktmässig mit diesem Repertoire, dem auch meine Ende 2016 beim Label OehmsClassics erschienene Debut CD „Time stands still“ gewidmet ist. Die Aufnahme wurde von der Presse begeistert aufgenommen und war für den ""Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik"" nominiert. Durch die positive Resonanz zusätzlich motiviert, entstand der Wunsch, eine weitere CD mit Werken aus dieser Blütezeit englischer Musik zu produzieren.
Gut die Hälfte dieser CD ist William Byrd (1543-1623) gewidmet. Obwohl Byrd, der als erstes Genie der Tastenmusik gelten kann, in seiner Zeit ähnlich bedeutend und einflussreich war wie Johann Sebastian Bach im folgenden Jahrhundert, findet man von seinen Werken weit weniger CD-Aufnahmen. So gut wie gar keine Einspielungen gibt es von den Cembalowerken von William Lawes (1602 – 1645) – wunderbare Miniaturen aus der Sammlung „Musick's Handmaid“ – und Matthew Locke (1621 – 1677), dessen raffiniert gesetzte Suiten stellenweise einen sehr individuellen Stil aufweisen.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>John Cossar is an emerging songwriter from Burgeo, Newfoundland who just turned sixty.    He has gained much recognition and support from other artists and music fans in St. John's, where he now lives.   His songs are evocative, honest, memorable.    Twice in the past year he has been funded for recording by our provincial music industry association, MusicNL.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In December of 2010 we released his debut recording, a seven tune sampler titled ""Heart on Fire.""   A few months later, John received approval for funding of $6000 to support him in recording a full length CD.   Since February we have been in Record Time Studios in St. John's working on his songs, with support from an impressive group of local musicians including Chris Kirby, Rick Lambe, Rick Hollett and Dan Rubin.    The new recording, ""Another Bridge to Burn"" will be released on July 22.    We need your help in completing the funding for this project.  <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>John's songs have a profound effect on those who hear them.    His honesty and skill as a songwriter combine to make his songs potent and emotionally indelible.   People who listen are often in tears, or dancing with joy.   He is a prolific composer with more than fifty original songs to his credit, and more coming all the time.     Newfoundland seems to breed amazing musicians, and John is the perfect example of this.    </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To get his songs out to the world we need your help.    You can help us reach out across Canada, the United States and around the world.   With your help we can establish John Cossar as a songwriter with international stature and recognition.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already have a commitment of $6000 from our provincial music industry association to support this project, and several hundred dollars in CD sales from the debut recording.   But we will need twice that amount to complete the recording, mixing, mastering and manufacture of the new CD and then launch it effectively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need funds for the following specific costs:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Musicians' fees           $4000</p>
<p>Studio costs                $2000</p>
<p>CD manufacturing       $1700</p>
<p>CD design &amp; artwork   $1100</p>
<p>Launch event              $1200<br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you contribute to this project you will become part of our Community of Support.  Everyone who donates $25 or more will receive a copy of the new CD and will receive updates and emails from us regarding John's appearances and upcoming releases.     We will acknowledge your support (unless you wish to remain anonymous) and you will be invited to join us as a guest when John appears or performs at a nearby venue.<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can also help us by joining our Street Team to help get the word out about this amazing songwriter.   When John tours we will need help with postering, bugging record stores, and making contact to promote awareness of his music.    We are particularly interested in developing touring opportunities in Britain, Europe and Australia.   If you have contacts in those areas, please let us know.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We can add you to our email list so you will be kept informed about future performances, and we would love to have your input about the songs and how to build our audience.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Hey, we’re Elias, Eric, Aaron and Josh – also known as The City Harmonic.  We’re four worship leaders from four churches in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada who decided to become a band four years ago, and whose lives have changed radically as we travel the world and have been blessed with the opportunity to worship alongside many of you singing songs like “Manifesto”, “Mountaintop” and “Holy (Wedding Day)”. And we’re here asking for your help because we’ve reached something of a crossroads in our ministry and touring life! The fact is – we need to buy a tour bus! Here’s why:</p>
<p>In late 2011 our bassist, Eric Fusilier, was diagnosed with a form of Leukemia that sidelined him for 18 months while he fought for his life. During this time we pushed through together as a band and community and to support him financially and emotionally through that time. And now, having beat the cancer that nearly killed him we would love for Eric to be able to return without hesitation to the ministry he helped to start. And this is exactly what he wants too!</p>
<p>You see, over the past couple years we’ve played nearly 300 shows. This often meant driving through the night in our white conversion 11-seater to get there. This might sound kind of rock-and-roll but with Eric recovering from his bout with cancer, sleep is an important part of his recovery. In other words this isn’t going to work out as it is! Not to mention that with 300,000 miles on it, the van itself doesn’t have much longer to go. As married guys with kids, we’re also pretty excited at the potential for our families to be more involved in this ministry as well!</p>
<p>We’ve come across a tour bus that will be exactly what we need and is priced at an affordable $70,000 (for a vehicle like this – it’s an insane price). We’ve tried it and had it looked over and are very confident it will do the trick!</p>
<p>So we’re here asking for your help to raise a down payment of $30,000 in order to get us started!</p>
<p>By getting involved you’ll be making it possible for Eric to return to the band, for our ministry to continue in a financially sustainable way, and for our families to spend more time together as we do it!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The purchase price for the bus is a total of $70,000 of which we’re seeking to raise at least $30,000 here on IndieGoGo.  Check out some of the awesome packages below as perks you'll get when you choose to help!</p>

<p><strong>My name is Candi Carpenter. I came to Nashville when I was 15, and instead of going to highschool, I got my education singing in bars and honky tonks until 3:00 AM, and hanging out backstage at The Grand Ole Opry on the weekends. I've had the opportunity to tour and perform with legendary acts, and learn from watching my heroes in person. <br/><br/></strong><strong>Thanks to the recent success of my first music video for <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCY2Ok7caeY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""My Fault Too""</a>, and the amazing support of my fans at live shows, I've generated a lot of record label interest. The next step is to go into the studio to make this album!<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>Tell me more about the project.</strong><br/></strong>I will be recording 14-16 songs and deciding on 10-12 for the album. Two of the songs that will appear on the record were co-written with Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Member, Phil Everly of The Everly Brothers. Phil will also sing harmony with me on one of the tracks. I co-wrote many of the other songs with CMA, ACM and Grammy award winning and nominated songwriters. Some of their hits include the #1 ""One More Day,"" recorded by Diamond Rio, and the most played song of 2005, ""That's What I Love About Sunday,"" recorded by Craig Morgan. These guys have a track record for writing hits, and I am privileged to be working with them. I also have an incredible producer and creative team behind me to give me the support and guidance necessary to make this album a success. <strong>My goal is to make this record we can all be proud of!</strong><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>So, why Indiegogo?<br/></strong>I love my fans! I want to partner with them to make this project a reality.</p>
<p><strong><strong>What happens if we raise more than the goal?<br/></strong></strong>That would be a dream! Making a record is so much more than just recording.<strong> Any additional funds raised will go toward mastering, album artwork, updated photos, a new website, a music video, social media promotion, marketing and tour support.</strong> This is not a glamorous lifestyle, and I will not be personally keeping any of the money raised. Every dime will go into taking my music to the next level.<strong><br/><br/>How will my contribution help?</strong> <br/>Your pledges will fund the production of my first full length studio record, tentatively titled, <em>Candi Land</em>. Having a budget will allow me the opportunity to work with a production team I trust, and carefully record in a studio I love. We will be able to take our time, and think about the quality of the music instead of the ticking clock. Director, <a href=""http://www.justinefeldt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Justine Feldt</a> and I will also be collaborating on a documentary about the making of the record. A small portion of the money raised will go toward renting lights, camera equipment, and other production materials neccesary for visually documenting the recording process.<br/><br/><strong>The Impact:<br/></strong><strong>Having the opportunity to make this record will change my life, and my career. It was also help go on tour, and hit the road to come to a town near you! Having you along for the journey means the world to me, and I can't wait to share the finished product with you.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<br/><br/>New Direction Fest is a multiple day event that will be taking place in Olympia, Washington on August 19th &amp; 20th, 2011. It will be a space for people of the worldwide hardcore and punk community to share experiences, skills, ideas, and information about community organizing, activism, labor organizing, and other forms of radical action. This convergence will include live bands, workshops, and speakers engaged in the practical application of the radical ideas and values of hardcore punk. Through these, we hope to inspire and to mobilize one another to form a global network of resistance and a movement for radical change within the hardcore and punk community. The goal of this fest is to breathe new life into the hardcore tradition of resistance and to push our networks towards a NEW DIRECTION where we can bridge the gap between hardcore values and the application of these values through radical practice.<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We live in scary times. We are  witnessing the eruption of a number 
of societal  tensions on a global  scale and it is far from clear what 
the results will be.  Millions of  people unemployed and being 
foreclosed and evicted from their  houses;  millions in prison; military
 conflict around the world with no end in   sight; the melting of 
glaciers and polar ice caps along with mounting  natural  disasters and 
growing scarcity of resources exacerbated by  climate change;  rising 
racial supremacist movements; depression and  trauma on a massive scale;
  the mass incarceration and discrimination  against “non-citizens”; and
 the  continual centralization of wealth and  means of human livelihood

</div></div>","Our Story
New Direction Fest is a multiple day event that will be taking place in Olympia, Washington on August 19th & 20th, 2011. It will be a space for people of the worldwide hardcore and punk community to share experiences, skills, ideas, and information about community organizing, activism, labor organizing, and other forms of radical action. This convergence will include live bands, workshops, and speakers engaged in the practical application of the radical ideas and values of hardcore punk. Through these, we hope to inspire and to mobilize one another to form a global network of resistance and a movement for radical change within the hardcore and punk community. The goal of this fest is to breathe new life into the hardcore tradition of resistance and to push our networks towards a NEW DIRECTION where we can bridge the gap between hardcore values and the application of these values through radical practice.

The Impact
We live in scary times. We are  witnessing the eruption of a number 
of societal  tensions on a global  scale and it is far from clear what 
the results will be.  Millions of  people unemployed and being 
foreclosed and evicted from their  houses;  millions in prison; military
 conflict around the world with no end in   sight; the melting of 
glaciers and polar ice caps along with mounting  natural  disasters and 
growing scarcity of resources exacerbated by  climate change;  rising 
racial supremacist movements; depression and  trauma on a massive scale;
  the mass incarceration and discrimination  against “non-citizens”; and
 the  continual centralization of wealth and  means of human livelihood 
in the hands of  a small but powerful class of  people. The point is not
 to paint a picture of a  hopeless situation in  which everything is 
falling apart and the world is ending  because of  some supposed 
inherent evil of human kind. The point is it’s   increasingly obvious 
that the flawed systems which these problems stem  from are  no longer 
tolerable: capitalism, industrialism, representative  politics, all  
forms of oppression. As all these various crises  converge we are told 
we can  look to our political systems for  solutions, or ought to lose 
ourselves in some  spectacular new product  or substance. These answers

chose d’important pour les parents et enfants de familles avides de vivre pleinement les
si tendres moments de l'enfance de nos enfants.
Mes expériences
professionnelles acquises dans le monde des médias et de
l’enseignement ainsi que mon vécu de maman m’ont conduites à créer des événements pour aider les parents à être parents (Cafés de parents, émissions télévisées). VOICI LE PREMIER CLIP : ""Papa Maman"" avec la voix de Lilian ThuramParce que j'ai besoin de partager toujours plus, les chansons de ce projet ""Toujours là"", me sont arrivées comme des cadeaux. En me promenant sur mon vélo, en faisant mes courses, il y a tout à coup un moment où paroles et mélodies me prennent et le besoin de m'enregistrer s'impose.

<p><b>WHY WE'RE ASKING FOR HELP</b></p>
<p>Living a life of music can mean living through some serious up and downs, highs and lows, peaks and valleys.  There are cycles at play, and certain points in that cycle will always be difficult to deal with.

<p>The year we make an album is a strange one. All of a sudden we've stopped playing concerts so that we can hole ourselves up at home to write songs, or in the studio to capture them. It is an incredibly beautiful time in our lives, but things get expensive in a big way, as we simultaneously lose the bulk of our income while we make preparations for the future.  </p>
<p>It makes me think of my farming friends who spend two whole seasons preparing their fields, planting their crop, tending to their crop, before finally harvesting and selling all of that beautiful food they've grown from the earth.

<p>When I think of crowdfunding sites like Indiegogo, I think of community shared agriculture (CSA) models, where everyone pitches in on the front end of a project so that the costs and risks involved are shared by both the artist/farmer and the people who love what they make.  It's a community, making things together. Food. Music. </p>
<p>To be sure, we'd like to tell you that this is the love of our lives. With or without your pre-order, or purchase of any of these perks, we will still make this album. We will still release it. We we still tour, and hopefully arrive in your town and play a show for you.  But being supported now, on the front end of all of this, would mean that we could jump head first into the next three years with little fear, or worry, or trepidation.  To feel the support of our community would mean strong confident strides towards our goals, instead of the halting baby steps we would surely be taking otherwise.  Either way we'll get there.

Island of Curaçao in the Caribbean off the coast of Venezuela, slaves long ago
created a form of performance called Tambú as their way of releasing negative
events that may have happened during the year.   But, since it came into being, Tambú has been banned or strictly
regulated by the Catholic Church and the local authorities. ” TAMBÚ — A HIP-SHIMMYING DANCE AND GENRE NAMED AFTER ITS
CENTRAL DRUM— is music of ritual
(like Brazilian camdomblé and Cuban Santería), protest and partying created by
African slaves and their descendants. It survived a 350-year ban in Curaçao,
and is still heavily regulated there. Its beat comes from hand drum and iron
percussion — often a hoe blade, used like both a bell and a scraper — and its
lyrics, as in other Afro-Caribbean styles, have often held political
statements, coded or not.” January 10, 2014

My name is Mark Nelson, I'm a multi-instrumentalist specializing in the roots of American music.I play old time tunes on the Appalachian dulcimer, fingerpicked Piedmont blues, rags and hokum on the ukulele and Hawaiian slack key guitar—yes, it does all fit together, but that’s a tale for another day. I’ve been invited to perform at Feile Iorras, a week-long multicultural folk festival in the tiny western Irish town of Belmullet, County Mayo.  Naturally, I want to present the best possible music—but how to find a band that is equally at home playing all of the different kinds of music comprising the great gumbo of pre-industrial American traditional music?Well, friends, I had to look no further than my old friend and long time musical collaborator Tim Crosby, and his life and musical partner Cindy. Given our mutually far-reaching musical experiences and taste, this is the ideal band to present the best in traditional music to Irish audiences.Tim is a wizard on the mandolin, no slouch on the fiddle, a fine flat-picker, and he can cover both Old Time and Bluegrass banjo styles. We got dubbed The Zygote Brothers after a friend said we played together like twins of different mothers. Tim is one fourth of the popular Northwest Bluegrass Band Kathy Boyd and Phoenix Rising.Cindy and Tim harmonize as only former high school sweethearts can; their band Briarose is entering its fourth decade. Cindy’s as strong a bass player as one could wish for, sings like an angel, and always keeps a cool head. Old friends and good music–who could ask for a better combination? Why We Are Asking For Your Support?Although we  jumped at the chance to realize our lifelong dream of performing in Ireland; the airfare of other expenses related to bringing a full band and our many instruments for such a short tour is far greater than any fees we’ll receive.

The Back StorySo how did a guy from a tiny community in rural Oregon get asked to perform at a festival in the west of Ireland?Thanks to a wonderful serendipity, that’s how. I was contacted by Glaoch an Cheoil an Irish language TV show that paired surplus and unused instruments and free musical instruction to anyone wishing to learn. So for the past year I’ve been teaching the dulcimer via Skype to the artistic director of Aras Inis Gluaire, an arts center in County Mayo. He even performed at the home of the Irish president!Bringing this band to Ireland is a way to continue these lessons in person, while giving Irish audiences the opportunity to hear what “Americana” music sounded like before anyone coined the name. I’ve played a lot of music in my life, and worked with some outstanding musicians, but I truly believe this is the best band I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with.Many thanks for your help and support. Other Ways You Can HelpOf course, there is no substitute for cold cash, but won’t you help spread the word?

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">I have already paid all the musicians
who played on the album and my long-time friend,
drummer and engineer, Patrick Herzfeld, opened up his brand new <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BlackCatRecordingStudio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Signal Hill Recording Studio</a> and co-produced,
engineered and mixed the entire album, but I haven't paid him yet. I also have
yet to pay the Mastering Engineer, Ben Blank, for his services and guidance throughout the project.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 15.0pt;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">So beyond paying Patrick and Ben for
their hard work, it takes money to promote the album to radio and press
outlets. Depending on how much much we raise will determine how much we can
spend on promoting the album and promotion is key. A radio promoter typically costs a few thousand
dollars to promote just one song to radio and a publicist will run about the
same for a 3 month promotional push to press, blogs, magazines, etc.</span></p>

set closers and dance floor favorites. As I mentioned in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAydPV_fxTk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a>, some of the
newer songs like ""One Foot In The Grave"" really mean a lot to me as

drummer and engineer, Patrick Herzfeld, opened up his brand new Signal Hill Recording Studio and co-produced,
engineered and mixed the entire album, but I haven't paid him yet. I also have
yet to pay the Mastering Engineer, Ben Blank, for his services and guidance throughout the project.
So beyond paying Patrick and Ben for
their hard work, it takes money to promote the album to radio and press
outlets. Depending on how much much we raise will determine how much we can
spend on promoting the album and promotion is key. A radio promoter typically costs a few thousand
dollars to promote just one song to radio and a publicist will run about the
same for a 3 month promotional push to press, blogs, magazines, etc.
It's an expensive game and the ones
with the most money usually are the ones you hear about, this is the reality of the music business.
The Album
This record has
been a long time a coming. The majority of these songs are throw-back country
songs that have been played over the years at shows and a few of them have been
set closers and dance floor favorites. As I mentioned in the video, some of the
newer songs like ""One Foot In The Grave"" really mean a lot to me as
they deal with stories of folks who really embody the power of the human
spirit.
I am very fortunate to call the musicians who played on the album, my friends. Every one of them are great people and they believe in the music. It's worth mentioning these fine souls:
Wayne Sutton - Electric Guitar (Sister 7, Patrice Pike, Brian Keane)Noah Jeffries - Fiddle (Milkdrive, Jason Boland)Will Dupuy - Vocals (South Austin Jug Band, Bruce Robison, La Tampiquena)Morgan Thompson - Bass (John Evans, Emily Bell, Deadman)Matt Lara - Accordion (La Tampiquena)Fletcher Murchison - Acoustic Mandolin (La Tampiquena)Patrick Herzfeld - Drums (Graham Wilkinson, John Evans, Emily Bell)
Music is not made alone, it's a collective vibe and spirit - these guys made it happen and I am eternally grateful!

The Rewards
As you can see to the right, there a bunch of ways you can support the funding of the album and receive unique rewards in return. One of those unique rewards is the signed limited edition poster designed by Jeff Miller. Jeff is an old friend and has designed posters over the years for big festivals and bands, like Widespread Panic. Another reward that I am excited about is the Songwriting Session. I am curious to see if any of y'all will take advantage of that one - who knows, you could write a hit. 
Whatever you choose, I appreciate your support. Here is what the poster looks like.


 
Your Help
I understand some of y'all just can't contribute and that's cool, but that doesn't mean you can't help. The best way you can help is by spreading the word on Facebook, Twitter, etc about this campaign to your friends and folks who you think would be interested in the music.
Thank you for your support and peace to you and all your people!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Mandee, I'm from Connecticut, and I'm a photographer. That's the short version of the story. The longer version is this... I've been shooting bands performing live since I was 16 years old. I am now 23, and have graduated college. I have been part of a few gallery showings during my time in college, and since then. to be honest I have felt out of place in such showings among the photos of landscapes, still life, and simpler portraits. As of recent I've been feeling the need to get my photos seen in a new setting, outside of on websites for the bands that I work with. Then I remembered what my photography professor told me, ""You could always put out your own book."" After some thought, I feel like this is the right step forward towards expanding myself as an artist. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I feel the title of this future book, ""Mandee P.'s Rock n' Roll Diary"", describes exactly what it will be. This book will feature the photos that I have been taking of different local bands over the past six years. My style of shooting comes from standing near the edge of the stage, and being in awe of the talent I have had the privilege of watching. In getting this book put together I would be able to share my photography with a completely new audience of viewers. This book will by my scene, through my eyes. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal for right now is to get the book put together, and get the first 50 copies printed. The cost of all of this to me, $4,000, that I don't have. This is where your generosity comes in. If I can't raise the funds through here, I can't put out the book. It's that simple.<br/></p>
<p>To show my gratitude to those of you who take the time to give me some money to make this possible I have a range of tokens of said gratitude for you. They range from a simple ""Thank you."" in the final copy of the book, to signed prints, special photography session packages, and a one-on-one learning session with me.  <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can find it in yourself to not only donate, but pass on this page to some people you know I would also be so very grateful. Thank you all so much for reading this! I hope the next time I am addressing you, it's in the ""Thank you""s of the book.<br/></p>

<h3>My mission</h3>
<p>Hello music lovers, my name is Cait Cuneo and I am a music artist. Recently, I have been working endlessly on my first E.P. ""Violet"" I am hoping to release it this fall along with my first music video. ""Violet"" stands for strength, women empowerment, heart, light, guidance, and individuality. Within the E.P. you will hear the concrete struggle that was necessary in order for me to develop my strength and find my own voice. Each musician, and the production team involved on the record are close friends and family. This has allowed the music to be honest and limitless.</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to get my project off the ground and start spreading this music for the world to hear. My hope is that this music can influence people with its positive message. I believe that everyone has a dream that deserves notice, and that is why I write, sing, and perform music. The necessary steps needed to start this journey is a record ready for distribution, a music video, and a band to bring these new songs to life. With your support spiritually and financially, each of you can be a key part of my personal music goal.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With every successful goal comes a great story. I want you all to be a part of this story that has brought me to this profession. To get me to this next musical step in my career, I will need some financial backing to make these steps. I have set the financial goal to $10,000, because this will be the minimum cost of making these <strong>3</strong> necessary steps a reality.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> These funds will first go to mixing and mastering the music on the E.P., which will then be printed to cd, vinyl, and available digitally. ""Violet"" will first be sent to the people help me get to this goal. It will then be sent to radio stations and other promotional tracks around the world to attract new listeners to my music.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The next step, is to release this music with a surprise performance of all the music I have been working on. There are many aspects to putting on a concert that entail great financial backing. Promotions; including posters, flyers, newspaper ads, and radio support, allow new and current fans to be informed about this first performance. I am using all professional musicians that all deserve to be properly paid for their talent, skill, and time spent on making my project come to life. Paying for proper lighting and a sound engineer are necessary to make this performance look and sound great. With your help, you can share this experience with me and be right my side for this whole process. The perks offered will give you physical and mental memories that I hope last for a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The final step to bring my project to the view of worldwide listeners is a music video. This takes hiring professional videographers that will make one song portray my heart and soul in a several minute video. I believe in making the highest quality video possible because I believe that is what my fans deserve. If completed, all who donated will get a private screening of the video before it is released to the public. Some will have a chance to be in the shooting of the music video</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If the goal is met, I will forever will be grateful to all who donated or helped spread the word about my music. You will be rewarded with not only these perks below, but my lifetime dedication to making music. If my financial goal is not met, I will use the funds donated to make as many steps possible towards my mission. And, I will reward those who donated for their belief in me as an artist. If the goal goes over the limit I have set, this will only enhance the experience that I hope to share with you.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can or cannot donate, please help spread this word to family, friends, and any person that loves music. Also you can use the various share tools created by Indie Go Go that works for multiple forms of media.

I believe in making the highest quality video possible because I believe that is what my fans deserve. If completed, all who donated will get a private screening of the video before it is released to the public. Some will have a chance to be in the shooting of the music video
The Impact
If the goal is met, I will forever will be grateful to all who donated or helped spread the word about my music. You will be rewarded with not only these perks below, but my lifetime dedication to making music. If my financial goal is not met, I will use the funds donated to make as many steps possible towards my mission. And, I will reward those who donated for their belief in me as an artist. If the goal goes over the limit I have set, this will only enhance the experience that I hope to share with you.

Goon Road, if searched on Google, will give you results about a haunted road, with a troubling, dark past. The story goes: Goon Road lies somewhere in the woods in Southern Illinois ten minutes from St. Louis, Missouri. It's a private gravel road, riddled with no- trespassing signs, covered in brush, with three hills leading back into the woods. Eventually, the road ends up coming upon a private property with empty and abandoned houses, sheds, and barns. It's said that an inbred family used to live on the property, and would release their wild dogs on any trespassers This family would torture and brutally their captured prize. The road is an attraction for haunting buffs, and is a well- known urban legend in Illinois and the St. Louis area. This street that I’ve lived on since my adolescent years is named something completely different on your everyday street map, giving it a ""normal neighborhood road"" feeling. My friends and I used to go to the first hill on Goon Road when we were growing up to smoke, drink, and party, because it was in the woods where the cops and neighbors couldn't hear us. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It is this combination of the actual haunted story and my upbringing (the years of ""partying"" on the road) that inspired me to create this concept album. </span></p><p><b>What to expect from Hill Two:</b></p><p><b></b></p>Nick Menn’s second installment of the Goon Road Series ‘Hill Two’ starts right in the middle of the chaos and danger that is Goon Road.

If ‘Hill One’ is drug consumption, ‘Hill Two’ is the drugs taking effect.  ‘Hill Two’ puts the album in over-drive with its high energy, and bravado nature, as if Nick is seemingly not worried about the haunted story of Goon Road.  ‘Hill Two’ is the part in the scary movie where the main character hears a sound, and instead of running away, goes to investigate the problem.

<h3>Short Summary<br/>
</h3> <p>My name is Elise Letourneau. I am a multiple award-winning composer with more than 30 years experience working in music. Since December 2013 I have been composing a requiem to commemorate the upcoming 25th Anniversary of the École Polytechnique Massacre.<br/></p>
<div>On December 6, 1989, a gunman entered École Polytechnique in Montreal and started shooting, killing 14 young women and injuring 10 other women and 4 men before turning the gun on himself.</div>
<div>""Requiem for Fourteen Roses"" will be performed at Knox Presbyterian Church in Ottawa the evening of Saturday December 6, 2014 -- 25 years to the day after the tragedy took place. The work is for vocal soloist, choir, and 8-piece chamber ensemble.</div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Creating an event like this is expensive. The project budget is broken down into the following areas:</p>

<div>Written to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the École Polytechnique Massacre, ""Requiem for Fourteen Roses"" is a concert-length work for female vocal soloist, choir, flute, 2 flugelhorns, 2 trombones, cello, contrabass, and piano. It begins with 14 tolls of a bell while roses are laid, and continues with instrumental, vocal, and choral music.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>Though not written specifically as a religious work, the choir does sing some sections of the traditional mass, as well as the 23rd Psalm, in French. The choir also has sections to sing in English, using texts by Rabindranath Tagore, who won a Nobel prize for his work.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>The female soloist sings music composed to contemporary sonnets from the Governor General's Award-winning book, ""Woman at a Piano"" by poet Ted Blodgett, who has graciously granted permission for his work to be used in this context. Sienna Dahlen has accepted to perform the works. She is one of Canada's most original and versatile singer-composers-multi-instrumentalists whose music spans folk, jazz, and experimental styles. Sienna is the featured vocalist on ""Notes on Montreal"", the CD by Montreal-based composer/guitarist Mike Rud that received this year's Juno award for vocal jazz.<br/><br/>
</div>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: Verdana; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: normal;""></span>Interspersed among the vocal works are fourteen short instrumental vignettes to be performed by the brass quartet, one for each of the young women who were murdered.</p>
<p>This project has significance for me as a composer of vocal music, but also as a Canadian woman. Like many of the young women who were lost, I was born in the second half of the 1960s. I have often stopped to wonder what they might be doing now had their lives not been cut short. The 25th anniversary is significant because 25 years represents a generation of Canadians, and a generation is long enough to forget. For many, the event and its memorials have come to represent violence against women, and though this is important, I view this music project in larger terms. There are so many forms of violence in our society: against women, children, men, animals, the Earth, our very selves, and more. Simply put, we must learn to be good to each other, and in addition to the fourteen young women who lost their lives on December 6 - 1989, I dedicate this work to the good that resides in each of us.</p>

Folks dance, chat, swim in the river and share picnics while children play on the huge community-built playground. They walk and ride bikes. There are merch sales, art vendors and food trucks, raffles, and overnight camping. The town of Hailey, full of restaurants, bars and shopping is a short walk away.<br/><br/>

It'll be a whole day of awesome <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">free</span> music. Headlining the show are <a href=""http://jakehillmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Jake Hill &amp; Deep Creek</a> and <a href=""http://www.rodeorubylove.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Rodeo Ruby Love</a>.</p><p></p><h2>How we got here</h2><p>In 2007, after years of frustration with 
the local music circuit, we decided that Plymouth needed an all-day free music 
festival for us young folks. The bands needed a place to play, and the fans needed a place to hear music they loved.<br/></p><p>Five
 years later, the Plymouth Independent Music Festival is a thriving 
mid-summer celebration of original music. Weâ€™ve still got the rag-tag, 
grassroots spirit we started with â€“ the 8-hour-long festival is staffed 
by 8 or so volunteers, and yes itâ€™s a bit rough around the edges, but 
thatâ€™s what makes it so fun.</p><p>We
 started this thing when we were 20 years old (founders Scott, Jon, and Harry), and every year weâ€™re still more and more excited about the show,
 even at the ripe old age of 25... help us keep it growing.</p><h2>Great for Plymouth, great for the scene</h2><p>Our
 favorite thing about producing these free summer shows is the sense of 
community that forms around the events and the music. Our main goals 
are to help musicians get their work out into the world, and to 
contribute in a positive way to Plymouthâ€™s bustling summer economy.</p><h2>What we need &amp; what you'll get</h2>The
 great thing about donating to the PIMF is that you can come right down to 
the show on July 21st and see your much-appreciated money at work. In addition to that, we'll give you some fun things like stickers, music, backstage passes, and even the opportunity to introduce a band on stage at the show. <p>An
 all-day festival takes a lot of time, energy, and money to pull off 
â€“ weâ€™ve got the first two of those covered (and those can often make up 
for a lack of #3), but we need donations and advertising to raise enough
 cash to make this show as great as it can be.</p><h2>How will we use the money?</h2>
The answer(s): Equipment, food, drinks,

It'll be a whole day of awesome free music. Headlining the show are Jake Hill & Deep Creek and Rodeo Ruby Love.How we got hereIn 2007, after years of frustration with 
the local music circuit, we decided that Plymouth needed an all-day free music 
festival for us young folks. The bands needed a place to play, and the fans needed a place to hear music they loved.Five
 years later, the Plymouth Independent Music Festival is a thriving 
mid-summer celebration of original music. Weâ€™ve still got the rag-tag, 
grassroots spirit we started with â€“ the 8-hour-long festival is staffed 
by 8 or so volunteers, and yes itâ€™s a bit rough around the edges, but 
thatâ€™s what makes it so fun.We
 started this thing when we were 20 years old (founders Scott, Jon, and Harry), and every year weâ€™re still more and more excited about the show,
 even at the ripe old age of 25... help us keep it growing.Great for Plymouth, great for the sceneOur
 favorite thing about producing these free summer shows is the sense of 
community that forms around the events and the music. Our main goals 
are to help musicians get their work out into the world, and to 
contribute in a positive way to Plymouthâ€™s bustling summer economy.What we need & what you'll getThe
 great thing about donating to the PIMF is that you can come right down to 
the show on July 21st and see your much-appreciated money at work. In addition to that, we'll give you some fun things like stickers, music, backstage passes, and even the opportunity to introduce a band on stage at the show. An
 all-day festival takes a lot of time, energy, and money to pull off 
â€“ weâ€™ve got the first two of those covered (and those can often make up 
for a lack of #3), but we need donations and advertising to raise enough
 cash to make this show as great as it can be.How will we use the money?
The answer(s): Equipment, food, drinks, 
insurance, promotion, and, of course, music. Weâ€™ve got some equipment upgrades that need to 
happen before the show, and even things like cables and mic stands can 
really add up when you need a lot of them. Weâ€™re fortunate enough to 
work with some bands who volunteer their time, or play for food and gas 
money (and merch sales...buy CDs at the show!), but that all costs some 
money. We also need to feed and hydrate everyone whoâ€™s working at the

<strong>Hi friends, music lovers, and supporters of workplace health! </strong> </h2>
<p>The inspiration for Workplace Singing came originally from my experience directing a workplace choir in Norway seven years ago. Those choir members came from their workday to choir with such joy!</p>
<p>I have directed a workplace choir in Nelson BC for the past six years, which has only reinforced what I already knew: that singing together with a group of people creates a group cohesion and sense of harmony that you don't get in any other way. Singing brings joy and energy to individuals in the group, and even if some people arrive tired, grumpy, or stressed, we all leave energized and happy. </p>
<h2>
<strong>How your donations will help</strong> <strong>this project!</strong> </h2>
<p>Your donations will make possible the advertising, already underway, to inspire Norwegian companies to try Workplace Singing. Next, the funds generated will pay for a work permit (substantial!) and support the director and creator of this project (me!) until the project becomes self-sufficient in September.</p>
<p>If the pledges reach beyond the goal of $3,000.00, the project will have even more foundation for success. I will then be able to put all my focus into showing companies how this project will benefit them, and ultimately, how it will benefit the world, as employees begin to enjoy their work more, connect with their colleagues, and return home from work energized and open-hearted.</p>
<p>So, here's how you can help: Pledge a little more if you are able, and more than anything,<strong> share, Share <strong>SHARE</strong>!!</strong> Share it on your facebook page, or better still, <strong>Send the link</strong> out to all your friends and contacts. Tell them what you love about the project. You will be giving a gift to the employees who will sing together next year, and to those who will discover Workplace Singing when it comes to Canada and the US in future years. </p>
<h3><strong>And now, more about me and how this will work! </strong></h3>
<p>Through years of teaching many different groups, I have developed a keen ability to know what a group will be able to do in a given amount of time, and people are often amazed at how good their group sounds in the end. In our day and age, ""I can't sing"" is a much-repeated phrase.</p>
<p>In my experience, everyone can sing if the desire is there. In a group of people who work together, there will always be a range of ability, and those who are not accustomed to singing are supported by the strong voices of those who sing confidently. I always start small, humming together and listening to each other, then teaching one or two simple, gentle and fun voice exercises. The first songs I teach a group, are songs that are in a middle range, with melodies that are easy to connect with. I teach a range of styles, from slow and beautiful, to joyful and upbeat, quirky and funny. If there is time, if a group has strength in numbers, or a few confident singers to support, we move on to singing with harmonies and exciting rhythms. It's always fun, and there is always something for everyone.</p>
<p>The experience will be different for each workplace, depending on the number of people, range of people, and depending on how much time they commit to singing together. But it will always give employees a renewed enthusiasm for what they are doing, and for working together. </p>
<p>I look forward to expanding this work from one choir to several workplace groups of varied sizes, abilities and personalities! Thank you so much for your support!</p>

<h2><strong>Hei venner, musikkelskere, og støttere av arbeidsplass velvære!</strong></h2>
<p>Inspirasjon for “sang på arbeidsplassen” kom opprinelig fra da jeg dirigerte et bedriftskor i Oslo for syv år siden. Kor medlemmene kom fra arbeidsdagen med så mye gleden!</p>
<p>Jeg har dirigert et arbeidsplassen kor i Nelson BC i de siste seks årene som bare har forsterket det som jeg allerede visste: at å synge sammen med en gruppe mennesker skaper en gruppesamhold og følelse av harmoni som du ikke får på noen annen måte. Dessuten, at synging bringer glede og energi til individene i gruppen, og at selv om noen mennesker kommer trøtt, gretten, eller stresset, vil alle dra energiske og glade.</p>
<h2><strong>Hvordan dine bidrag vil hjelpe dette prosjektet: </strong></h2>
<p>Ditt bidrag vil gjøre reklame mulig for å inspirere norske bedrifter til å prøve “Sang på arbeidsplassen”, samt en begynnerlønn for å støtte meg, direktør og skaperen av dette prosjektet, frem til prosjektet blir selvforsynt i september.</p>
<p>Dersom dette prosjektet løfter nå utover målet på $ 3,000.00, vil prosjektet ha enda mer grunnlag for suksess. Jeg vil da kunne sette all min fokus til å vise selskapene hvordan dette prosjektet vil gavne dem, og til slutt, hvordan det vil nytte verden, når ansatte begynner å trives mer, få god kontakt med sine kolleger, og kommer hjem fra jobb oppfrisket og åpenhjertige.</p>
<p>Så, her er hvordan du kan hjelpe: å love litt mer til prosjektet hvis du er i stand, og mer enn noe, dele og spred budskapet! Send linken ut til alle dine venner og kontakter. Fortell dem hva du liker med prosjektet. Sånn gir du en gave til de ansatte som vil synge sammen neste år, og fremover.</p>
<h3><strong>Og nå mer om meg og hvordan dette fungerer!</strong></h3>
<p>Gjennom mange års undervisning mange ulike grupper, har jeg en utviklet evne til å vite hva en gruppe kan oppnå på en bestemt tid, og folk har vært overasket over hvor bra gruppen høres ut til slutt. I vår tid er ""Jeg kan ikke synge"" en mye gjentatt frase. Min erfaring er at alle kan synge hvis ønsket er der. I en gruppe mennesker som jobber sammen, vil det alltid være en forskjellige evnen, og de som ikke er vant til å synge er støttet av de sterke stemmene til dem som synger trygt. Jeg begynner alltid enkelt. Vi nynner sammen og lytter til hverandre, så underviser jeg en eller to enkle, skånsome og morsom taleøvelser.</p>
<p>De første sangene jeg underviser en gruppe er sanger som er i en middels rekkevidde, med melodier som er lette å få kontakt med. Jeg underviser en rekke stilarter, fra sakte og vakkert, til glade og upbeat, eksentriske og morsomme. Dersom tiden strekker, hvis en gruppe har styrke i antall, eller har noen selvsikre sangere å støtte seg på, beveger vi oss videre til å synge med harmonier og morsomme rytmer.</p>
<p>Den erfaringen vil være forskjellig for hver arbeidsplass, avhengig av antall personer, utvalg av personer, og avhengig av hvor mye tid de forplikter seg til å synge sammen. Men det vil alltid være morsomt, og vil gi de ansatte en fornyet entusiasme for hva de gjør, og for å arbeide sammen.</p>

<h3></h3>The Kane Kids (Topher, Meghan &amp; TJ) are part of the 8th grade honors
 symphonic band at Cane Creek Middle School.  Their band has been chosen
 to play at the Carnegie Hall Festival over Easter weekend 2014 (1 of 
only 4 middle schools in the country chosen!) This is an incredible 
opportunity for them, to say the least.  Not many people are able to say
 they played at Carnegie Hall when they were 13 years old! {TJ plays the alto saxophone; Topher plays the trombone and tuba; Meghan plays the flute.  They are multi-talented.}<br/>
 Needless to say, the cost of this trip is pretty steep and we need help
 in raising the funds to get them to Carnegie.  Any assistance, no 
matter how small would be greatly appreciated and very helpful.  They 
need to raise a total of $2000 to cover the cost of this 
trip.  <br/> In addition to this type of fundraising, they will be doing 
things such as a bake sale at church, playing on the sidewalks in 
downtown Asheville, doing a trio at a few local restaurants, playing 
outside a couple local stores.  They are more than willing to put forth a
 great deal of effort as this is something they so want to do.<br/>**Please be sure to click on the tabs on the site: updates, comments, gallery for more information, more videos and more photos.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask! <br/><p></p>

At the age of six, young Almonte was pulled on stage alongside the Doobie Brothers during their Farewell Tour to play the cowbell.  His first stage experience (cowbell moment) set the tone for the rest of his career: Tony has performed, recorded, and toured with several outfits north of the American border as well as bands and DJs from different parts of the globe, such as Grammy Award winners Little Louie Vega & David Morales, Kokolo Afrobeat Orchestra, Tony Okungbowa (from Ellen DeGeneres show), and performs regularly at Club Peopl with Jojo Flores.Photo: Grammy Award winner Louie Vega, Tony almonte & Jojo FloresAbout the Tony Almonte Project ""TAP""As of today, he has around 400 songs written and ready to go.

I wanted to be when I grew up, I'd have answered, ""archeologist!"". Digging up
dinosaur bones seemed thrilling. Perhaps my four-year-old self sought to
discover and analyze ancient remnants of history; to study the
transcendence of all living creatures here on earth, <i>or</i> I just loved playing in the dirt (but I'd like to think it
was more romantic than that). Either way, four-year-old ""Cheska"" would never
have answered that she felt destined to become a singer-songwriter. She wouldn't have pictured herself playing a guitar, let alone being able to pick one up! She'd never have guessed that, somewhere down the road, her biggest dream
would be to sing songs that she’d written on her own - songs with words
and melodies she’d yearn to share with the people she loved and with the
world beyond.</p>
<p>My name is Francesca
Blanchard, and I am a singer-songwriter, working to fund my first,
full-length album. I was born and raised in France, with a French father
and an American mother. Being born into two cultures, my life has
consistently entailed a merging of these two identities. I grew
up as a French girl, and found my initial identity on the sandy beaches
off the Mediterranean coast. My father spoke to me
in French; my mother, in English. After moving to Vermont in 2002, maintaining my French identity became
difficult. Writing songs in the language, however, helped me preserve this
essential part of myself.</p>

<p>The recording budget I am seeking to raise
with my campaign reflects my high aspirations. My first album should
conform to the highest possible professional standards. Quality will lead
to better results, both within the industry and from the public. An album
is no easy task to undertake: with the funds I raise, I will hire
professional musicians; I will record in <a href=""http://www.lanegibson.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lane Gibson</a>’s excellent studio in
Charlotte, (VT) with top-notch gear; I will have my recordings mastered by
a respected engineer, have it checked <b>over
</b>and <b>over again</b> to make sure it’s
flawless and ready for speakers big and small. I will work
with photographers and designers who can help reflect my personality
and music in visual terms.</p>
<p>It is easy to make a good album, but much
more difficult to make a great album that rises above today’s information
overload and stands the test of time. This is what I aim for with all of
my artistic work. With your support, I can achieve my goal and make it
count for the long term.</p>
<p><b>I hope to continue writing and performing
for the rest of my life</b>. With this opportunity to produce a full-length
album of my own material, I will be taking one more step (a huge one, at
that) towards making my musical aspirations real. With the help of those I
love, those who love me, those I’ve met on my travels in this big world, friends
of friends, strangers and avid music-lovers…with the help that people such
as you are able and willing to offer, my music-making life will adopt a

overload and stands the test of time. This is what I aim for with all of
my artistic work. With your support, I can achieve my goal and make it
count for the long term.
I hope to continue writing and performing
for the rest of my life. With this opportunity to produce a full-length
album of my own material, I will be taking one more step (a huge one, at
that) towards making my musical aspirations real. With the help of those I
love, those who love me, those I’ve met on my travels in this big world, friends
of friends, strangers and avid music-lovers…with the help that people such
as you are able and willing to offer, my music-making life will adopt a
whole new momentum and begin its debut in the big pond. I look forward to
jumping in with you.        : )Merci a tous! Francesca BlanchardTo listen to more of my music, learn more about me, tour dates, etc.:www.francescablanchard.comwww.facebook.com/francescablanchardmusicwww.francescablanchard.bandcamp.comSign up for my email list: http://eepurl.com/OnQObvideo credits (respectively):Boston University Media Team, Johns Hopkins Congdon II, Carl Heyerdahl, Erik Rojas & Chris Roewe",1.0,3,"1 Campaign

<p>Do you ever leave church feeling
like you could have given more during Worship?</p>
<p>Do you ever feel like your
Worshiping wrong?</p>
<p>Do you ever wonder what it truly
means to Worship?</p>
<p>Well, you're not alone. We are
<b>RENOVATION WORSHIP</b> and we too at some point in time asked the same questions. We took time and sat at the feet of God in prayer, and we finally understand the
meaning of worship. We want to access the authentic power of Worship &amp; Praise through
song by remaining hungry for God’s presence. We are a duo, Marcus &amp; Patience
St.Julien, who came together as one to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ
through our passion for music. </p>

Do you ever leave church feeling
like you could have given more during Worship?
Do you ever feel like your
Worshiping wrong?
Do you ever wonder what it truly
means to Worship?
Well, you're not alone. We are
RENOVATION WORSHIP and we too at some point in time asked the same questions. We took time and sat at the feet of God in prayer, and we finally understand the
meaning of worship. We want to access the authentic power of Worship & Praise through
song by remaining hungry for God’s presence. We are a duo, Marcus & Patience
St.Julien, who came together as one to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ
through our passion for music.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>#LetUsBreathe</h3> <p>After the shooting death of Mike Brown in Ferguson, MO, a group of poets, playwrights, educators, and activists in Chicago became deeply concerned about the police aggression toward peaceful protesters. They launched the #LetUsBreathe fundraising effort to bring tear gas protection, medical &amp; hygiene supplies, nonperishable food, and water to Ferguson protesters.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Ferguson, though the tone of the protests had become more peaceful, there were still a determined group of young people camping out in the protest area who vowed to stay until an arrest was made. <b>They are the Lost Voices.</b><br/><br/>#LetUsBreathe began documenting their stories and the evolution of the resistance in Ferguson. Unsatisfied with mainstream media's portrayal of youth of color and what has become the modern Civil Rights Movement, they began producing the <i>Lost Voices</i> documentary directed by award winning filmmaker Lonnie Edwards.</p>
<p><b>#LetUsBreathe has teamed up with Lost Voices to launch a tour of screenings, discussions, performances, and workshops</b> that will start in Chicago and travel across the nation to bring a story of young people overcoming their differences to unite against police brutality, the criminalization of youth of color, and the intersections of institutionalized oppression. </p>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Justice Is Not a Spectator Sport</h3> <p>Lost Voices consists of 11-15 men and women whose campsite was constantly terrorized by the police presence in Ferguson. On Friday September 26, their fourth campsite was raided, two women were brutally arrested, one woman was put in a chokehold until she blacked out, and all of the tents and camp supplies were carted away in trucks. </p>
<p><b>You can be involved</b> by contributing to housing, transportation, and meal costs for these brave youth as they travel around the country with the <i>Lost Voices</i> documentary film. </p>
<p>While some of our partner organizations will be able to help offset these costs, we recognize that the communities that most need the catalyzing dialogues provided by Lost Voices may not be able to afford hotel rooms for 15 people. <b>Your contributions will allow us to offer this programming at low or no cost to schools, non-profit organizations, and community colleges that want to hear the real story of what's happening in Ferguson from the people who have been at ground zero since Day 1. </b></p>

<br/><ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>American education has taken the critical thinking out of the classroom in such a way that many teenagers of color are never equipped with the tools to dissect the causes of their circumstances. </p>
<p>In Chicago, we see the staggering effects of this - as after school programming, arts curricula, and youth employment opportunities are decimated by exploitive and myopic policies, Chicago's teenagers are being slaughtered by gun violence, arrested, and incarcerated at a rate that should make it clear that older generations have gravely failed in its stewardship of the youth. </p>
<p>But this is not a story unique to Chicago. Communities of color across the country feel the effects of opportunities being choked off while education squelches rather than cultivates the youth's ability to connect the dots and analyze why their communities are the way they are. </p>
<p><b>The Lost Voices have been catalyzed by the tragic death of Mike Brown</b>, <b>and have a message for young people across the globe: ""Your beef with your neighbor is nothing compared to racism's beef with you. In order to defeat oppressive policies, your voice needs to be heard. Uniting instead of fighting is what we need to challenge the systems that create racist laws &amp; economic inequity.""</b></p>
<p>Because Lost Voices consists of young people ages 15-35 who came together across gang sets, socioeconomic backgrounds, and neighborhoods to form a family united by the cause of justice for Mike Brown, they are in the unique position to speak to a generation the media would like you to believe is apathetic and disengaged. <b>Lost Voices wants to bring its message to your city &amp; your youth: Your voice is power &amp; your lost voice can be found. </b></p>

<p></p>Short Summary<p>Hello I am Jasyn. I make music under the name God Module.</p>
<p>It is coming up on two years since the last God Module CD ""Séance"" was released and I am deep into the creation of the new CD ""False Face"". We are shooting for a March 2014 release date for this album, and of course plans are already being made for a full US tour to support it. </p>
<p>I decided to try a crowd funding campaign for this upcoming album and tour for the simple reason to make them better than what I can do on my own. Over the years I have met some awesome, talented and very passionate God Module fans and I think that together we can take these two projects far beyond what we have seen up to now.</p>
<p>This is not about making money in any way. Rather it is about having the funds to take both the new CD and the upcoming tour to a higher level for you to experience. When fans come to a God Mod show, I want them to have the same feeling that I had when I first went to a Skinny Puppy show from the ""Too Dark Park"" tour. I still remember how awesome it was -- the lights, the props, the backing videos; it all added so much to the music. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
<p>Any funds raised with this campaign will go directly into the production, artwork, and mastering of the <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">""False Face"" </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">album, as well as tour production</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. Touring is already expensive, even if you just show up and use the venue's potentially awful (if existing) lighting set-up. I don't want to have to rely on what the venue has. I want to be able to bring you God Module live the way it should be. We will use the money to create a custom light and visual stage show involving new horror props and stage decorations. On stage, I want to </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">visually</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> convey what I try to express in my music. I think by offering you guys some fucking awesome, one-of-a-kind perks when you contribute to this, we can do just that.</span></p>
<p>I am not asking you for a hand out here by any means. If you want to be super cool and donate money, that is awesome; however I want you guys to have a chance to get some things from this that you won't see every day. Among these are:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Stage banners from the Let's Go Dark, Triptych, and Empath 2.0 tours. </span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Masks and claws I have worn on stage around the world. </span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Three professionally created life size horror props that were used on the Seance tour.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Chances to get your name in the new CD. </span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Exclusive t-shirts, signed CDs and posters.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A golden ticket that will get you into any God Module show in the world from now on etc.</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Custom VillainX T-shirt design with your face.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">And finally I am even offering my actual one-of-a-kind stage prop ""Nubbins"" the zombie -- who has been on my mic stand at hundreds of shows across the globe. All I ask is if you buy him you give him a good home. He has done a lot over the years and deserves some rest in his old age.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Obviously all of this is going to be expensive. Our goal is $3500 and I think we can do a lot of what I want with this. If we don't reach it then I will do my best with what we have to still make the album and tour as special for all of you as possible. If we go over the amount then not only will the CD and tour become bigger and better, but after we reach the goal I will be give everyone who contributes some exclusive <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">bonus </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">God Module merch. We will do this every time we go $1000 over the goal. The first perk will be announced if we get that far. </span></p>

I still remember how awesome it was -- the lights, the props, the backing videos; it all added so much to the music. 
What We Need & What You Get
Any funds raised with this campaign will go directly into the production, artwork, and mastering of the ""False Face"" album, as well as tour production. Touring is already expensive, even if you just show up and use the venue's potentially awful (if existing) lighting set-up. I don't want to have to rely on what the venue has. I want to be able to bring you God Module live the way it should be. We will use the money to create a custom light and visual stage show involving new horror props and stage decorations. On stage, I want to visually convey what I try to express in my music. I think by offering you guys some fucking awesome, one-of-a-kind perks when you contribute to this, we can do just that.
I am not asking you for a hand out here by any means. If you want to be super cool and donate money, that is awesome; however I want you guys to have a chance to get some things from this that you won't see every day. Among these are:


Stage banners from the Let's Go Dark, Triptych, and Empath 2.0 tours. 
Masks and claws I have worn on stage around the world. 
Three professionally created life size horror props that were used on the Seance tour.
Chances to get your name in the new CD. 
Exclusive t-shirts, signed CDs and posters.
A golden ticket that will get you into any God Module show in the world from now on etc.
Custom VillainX T-shirt design with your face.

And finally I am even offering my actual one-of-a-kind stage prop ""Nubbins"" the zombie -- who has been on my mic stand at hundreds of shows across the globe. All I ask is if you buy him you give him a good home. He has done a lot over the years and deserves some rest in his old age.



Obviously all of this is going to be expensive. Our goal is $3500 and I think we can do a lot of what I want with this. If we don't reach it then I will do my best with what we have to still make the album and tour as special for all of you as possible. If we go over the amount then not only will the CD and tour become bigger and better, but after we reach the goal I will be give everyone who contributes some exclusive bonus God Module merch. We will do this every time we go $1000 over the goal. The first perk will be announced if we get that far. 
The Impact
Even though this is our first ""official"" crowd funding campaign, you guys have been doing this since we started simply by buying our music, coming to shows, buying t-shirts, etc. Without your support, I would just be making music for my friends and putting on shows in the mirror for myself... and a grown man jumping around a room alone, wearing a mask, making weird faces and screaming songs might seem a little insane to some people.

<p>I am Carmen Braden, a composer and performer in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. After years of musical creation and exploration, I have a boatful of beautiful music that wants to get recorded, and this is the year to do it!

<p>Why am I bringing together these two kinds of music? Why put a love song beside a piano trio about candle ice? or an adventure song beside a string quartet about ravens?

<p>One important part of this project is that I will record the album in the North alongside amazing and talented artists from the NWT. I will be singing and playing piano, and the instruments featured in the chamber works will also sound in the songs. The strength of this album will come from all the different components having the same core elements: the inspiration, the instrumentation, the players, the composer, and of course, the themes: beauty, curiosity, and the north.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Where the money goes, and what comes back to you</h3> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This project is a big one, and many challenges come with doing a major artistic undertaking in the NWT.

The Drive

Beauty, curiosity, deep listening, and careful sound-making - these drive my art. I love listening to the sub-Arctic soundscape, exploring it with all of my senses, then bringing it bedrock-deep into my music. I was born and raised in the north. I'm living in my hometown of Yellowknife, working as a full-time musician after finishing my Masters in Music in Composition at the University of Calgary. I love making music with my community: teaching, conducting, performing and learning. And I love music-making outside my community: sharing, engaging, and building relationships. All of these things come will be part of this album. 

This project is valuable to the whole northern community for several reasons. It will engage with local musicians who will give strong artistic performances, and we will all experience growth and development through the creation process of the album.. It will showcase the music of the north. And maybe it will inspire more curiosity and explorations of beauty from others. There aren't many northern composers who have written music from the north, although there is a great deal of music written about the north. It's time for this perspective to be heard. 
My music has been performed live many times in the north and across Canada by fantastic performers - the Gryphon Trio, Aurora Chorealis, the Elmer Iseler Singers, GroundSwell, Land's End Ensemble, the Whitehorse Community Choir, the Penderecki Quartet... By listening to these players (and many others!) I've discovered that the best music comes from building relationships. By listening to my teachers, I've learned to listen to my ear and my heart. And by listening to the world around me, I can testify that there will always be more beauty to explore.

The Plan

 I plan to record the album in the early-mid summer, and have all the production work done in time for a November release. This crowdfunding campaign will support the pre-production costs this project. Other funding sources will include giving house-concerts as fundraisers, applying for grants from Canada Council and other arts-supporting organizations, getting in-kind donations from local business (some already confirmed!) and putting in my own sweat equity (definitely confirmed).

<div>I'm just a regular guy working on some music under the name Laurel Bluffs. I've recorded 10 songs and they're ready to be mixed and mastered. I've spent a whole lot of hours making these songs. When you're not a super cool snowboarder, what else do you do in the dreary cold Autumn and Winter months? I was excited about Summer so a lot of the songs make you wanna eat a sandwich and dance in your backyard. Some of them are sad too. Winter can be a sad time. It's Summer now though so don't get down. </div>
<div>So, I need your help. As an educator working with high school special needs students my salary doesn't cut it when it comes to the post production costs. Don't worry mom I get 3 square meals a day. Sandwiches are mostly square. </div>
<div>By pre-ordering the album you'll be helping me get these songs out there into the ears of music listeners and YOU get an early digital download. </div> <p>This project is a lot different musically from what Anna and I have been doing publicly with the other group I'm in, Old Hours. On this album, I'm doing it all. I'm talking about vocals, guitar, bass, keys, drums, ambient noise, production. Except for a kick ass guitar solo by Jason Richard. It kills. </p>
<p>This album will make you want to: Dance in the kitchen, dance in an elevator, dance alone, drive late into the night and cry, dance with friends and their pets, dance with strangers and cry together in an elevator. Solidarity. Whole lotta dancing and crying if it takes you there.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>You get a pre-order/early release digital download of the album. That's pretty chill. </p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>It's quite a challenge but I'm willing to risk it all. My life is on the line here. My life. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I'm just a regular guy working on some music under the name Laurel Bluffs. I've recorded 10 songs and they're ready to be mixed and mastered. I've spent a whole lot of hours making these songs. When you're not a super cool snowboarder, what else do you do in the dreary cold Autumn and Winter months? I was excited about Summer so a lot of the songs make you wanna eat a sandwich and dance in your backyard. Some of them are sad too. Winter can be a sad time. It's Summer now though so don't get down. 
So, I need your help. As an educator working with high school special needs students my salary doesn't cut it when it comes to the post production costs. Don't worry mom I get 3 square meals a day. Sandwiches are mostly square. 
By pre-ordering the album you'll be helping me get these songs out there into the ears of music listeners and YOU get an early digital download.  This project is a lot different musically from what Anna and I have been doing publicly with the other group I'm in, Old Hours. On this album, I'm doing it all. I'm talking about vocals, guitar, bass, keys, drums, ambient noise, production. Except for a kick ass guitar solo by Jason Richard. It kills. 
This album will make you want to: Dance in the kitchen, dance in an elevator, dance alone, drive late into the night and cry, dance with friends and their pets, dance with strangers and cry together in an elevator. Solidarity. Whole lotta dancing and crying if it takes you there.     What We Need & What You Get You get a pre-order/early release digital download of the album. That's pretty chill. 

    Risks & Challenges It's quite a challenge but I'm willing to risk it all. My life is on the line here. My life. 
    Other Ways You Can Help Hide your kids, hide your lover, hide your friends, hide your neighbors and enemies. After they're hidden away show them this page and tell them life is gonna be okay. High-fives too, I'm always down for high-fives. Sprouts sandwiches are pretty killer too. Turkey and provolone on sourdough with every topping available.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Over the past couple of years since the band's inception we've been recording, performing, and traveling relentlessly, building a name for ourselves in the burgeoning folk scene of Athens and the surrounding region and bringing our unique take on traditional old time and bluegrass music (with classical and jazz undertones) to bars, festivals, dances, and more, whenever humanly possible. But after a small group of busy students and post-grads manages to cram well over 100 shows, four album and EP releases, and four proper tours (including one three-month sprawl throughout Europe) into a just-over-two-year span, you'd think we would have had enough, right?</p><p>Not so!

</p><p><b>Who
is Van Go Go?</b></p>
<p>Hello there. We are Van Go Go, a collaborative of musicians with and without developmental disabilities. The musical arm of Chicago based non-profit The Arts of Life, we have met every week for the past two years to write and rehearse songs that are infused with a warm blend of reggae, roots rock, and funk. Our lyrical hooks and dance grooves are bound to stick in your frontal
lobe making your feet do things you thought only James Brown was capable of. Coming from a community of musicians that is often marginalized rather than embraced for their unique contributions, these songs seek to deliver a sense of empowerment and enrichment to the human experience. Drummer and singer Nikole Heusman says it best:</p>
<p><b>“Our music makes me feel like I
can do something that frees me from my disability. Our music is for your heart
and for your soul.”</b></p>
<p>Together we have
written over a dozen original songs such as <i>Monster Man, Bad Girls, Time
Machine,</i> and <i>Danger to Society (Sometimes)</i>. We have the music. We have the
ambition. Now all we need is YOU!</p>
<p><b>How can you help?</b></p>
<p>We really need your support to make
this happen. We are extremely proud and fortunate to have volunteers and
musicians work with our band, however our needs go beyond just time and
diligence. We have set our eyes and hearts on one of Chicago’s premier
recording studios and they are eager to begin working with us. To make this
happen, we need to raise $5,000 in 30 days so we can fully record, produce,
mix, master, and release our album. With your support, we anticipate a late
summer to early fall release of the album. Just take it from singer and songwriter
Russell Copenharve:</p>
<p><b>“It's important to us, so we
can stick together. We need money to pay for everything.”</b></p>
<p>We are asking you to join us in this
unforgettable experience. Any donation, no matter how large or small, makes a
difference. Your ongoing support makes our success possible and now we need
your help to move forward. And of course, in proper Indiegogo style, we have
some fantastic perks as our way of saying “thank you” for your support.</p>
<p><b>What if we don’t reach our
goal?</b></p>
<p>While we are hopeful to reach our
goal, every dollar donated will be put towards taking this project as far as it
can go.  Whatever the outcome, it will be a promising experience for our
band to live out the dream of recording our first studio album. The best part
of it? You helped make it happen! </p>

Yes, it’s undeniable, the iPhone 12 series is one of the best smartphones around, and MagSafe technology has also added a brand new and exciting charging experience. But it's still not perfect, for instance:- iPhone 12 adopts the next-generation MagSafe wireless charging, but the way you charge it when you go out is old-fashioned.      - You can only charge iPhone 12 by laying it down on the MagSafe charger.- You have to buy an additional stand to hold your iPhone during video chatting, but only with limited angles.         MagSafe technology opens up the door for a whole new ecosystem of the accessories that work with the iPhone 12 models. We wanted to make a revolutionary innovation which brings more fun and convenience to the iPhone 12 series. So, we created MagPal. Specially designed for the iPhone 12 series, MagPal allows you to charge your iPhone 12 without the hassle of wires, while also allowing you to hold it in multiple angles. You'll never want to go back to cords again!    MagPal is not only a perfect companion for the iPhone 12, but also a versatile wireless power bank that can do more and work with your other devices while on the go.   Taking full advantage of MagSafe technology, MagPal works seamlessly with the iPhone 12 (Pro/Pro Max). Simply click the power button and snap MagPal onto the back of your iPhone 12 with perfect alignment every time, then you can get a quick and reliable power boost (7.5W high-speed magnetic wireless charging) that doesn’t block your camera while you’re on-the-go. No need for cables or precise placement. You can also enjoy total freedom with effortless detachment. Just ditch the cables and enjoy magnetic wireless charging for iPhone 12 series.        Note: Please click the power button to activate wireless charging. MagPal comes with strong N52 magnets that lock onto the built-in magnets of iPhone 12 to provide a secure hold. No need to worry about power failure when charging your iPhone 12 with MagPal in your bag.  No need to sacrifice style over substance as long as your iPhone 12 has a Magsafe-compatible case. Simply snap your iPhone 12 onto the charging pad and enjoy the effortless charging experience.      Simply attach the magnetic sticker to the back of your enabled wireless charging smartphone, then you can enjoy convenient wireless magnetic charging with MagPal. (You can purchase MagSticker as an add on.)    MagPal helps prevent an awkward cable from interrupting your grip. You can always enjoy a smooth and uninterrupted gaming experience. With the release of iPhone 13 series on 14th Sep, it's proved that iPhone 13 models still adopt Magsafe technology. So MagPal can definitely work with the iPhone 13 series. With MagPal's future-proof design, you do not need to buy additional charging device for your new iPhone. Equipped with a built-in wireless fast charger on the front cover, MagPal delivers a powerfully fast energy to go（10W Max). MagPal is compatible with all Qi enabled devices. It can fast charge your AirPods, supported iPhone and Android devices at 5W, 7.5W and 10W power, respectively. Internal circuitry will automatically detect how much wattage your devices require, so there’s no risk of damage. Simply place your device on MagPal’s cover and experience the convenience of true cable-free wireless charging. Equipped with a 18W PD Type-C port, MagPal can fast charge two devices simultaneously by utilizing both the wired and wireless options. MagPal will charge your iPhone 12 from zero to 50% in just 30 minutes through wired charging. It takes about 2 hours for MagPal to become fully charged.  Recommended: 20W or higher USB-C Power AdapterMagPal’s reliable 5,000mAh battery holds its charge for when you need power most. MagPal is perfect for everyday use, which is able to give the iPhone 12 Pro almost a full charge or the biggest iPhone 12 Pro Max an 80% boost.    As you accumulate more devices with different charging methods, what you really need is one MagPal for the lot.  Wireless charging in a power bank isn’t exactly a new idea, but we have made MagPal double as a charging stand as well. A foldable and adjustable kickstand on the back keeps it securely propped up while it’s in use and also supports your iPhone 12 at a comfortable viewing angle according to your different needs. The kickstand is made of four magnets and can be adjusted to two angles. The structure of MagPal kickstand is eligible for the protection under a utility model patent.Video conferencing has become more normal than going to office during quarantine period. It would be embarrassing if your iPhone 12 runs out of power during an important video chat. With MagPal, you can take the video meeting with hands-free ease and keep your phone charged all the time. MagPal is also useful as a source of backup power while enjoying entertainment.The kickstand is made out of strong magnets and durable leather, so you don’t have to worry about accidentally snapping it off.     MagPal is equipped with circuitry that supports pass-through charging, allowing you to charge the power bank itself and your device at the same time. The pass-through feature would be very helpful when you do need to go mobile at the last minute, making you well prepared with a fully-charged power bank.      The compact design is the key to its portability. MagPal is actually only around 68mm long and 17.2mm thick, making it sufficiently small for a pocket or bag.    MagPal has passed FCC, RoHS 2.0,  and CE’s strict safety standards. MagPal also has eight different types of protections, including overcharge protection, voltage protection, temperature monitoring protection, and more. It gives all-round protections that ensure safety for the device and its users.  Our engineers made a comparison test of charging iPhone 12 (airplane mode) from 0 using MagPal and Apple Magsafe Battery Pack in our lab (77℉). As seen from the below chart, MagPal has a faster charging speed and can fully charge iPhone 12.  Laser Carving   Magnetic Power Comparison (MagPal vs Apple Magsafe Battery Pack)

MagHub optimizes your access to your peripherals and takes charge of every task you undertake on your MacBook.Rather than relying on faulty mechanical locks, MagHub uses a magnetic lock. This adds to the sleek, sophisticated style that we have adhered to throughout the design process. Both parts of MagHub, the hub and leather backplate, fit right into the MacBook aesthetic. The innovative, patent-pending magnetic design also drastically simplifies the set-up and attachment process.  Encased in CNC-precision-milled aluminum, MagHub will stand the test of any lifestyle. We have used premium materials and manufacturing processes to build it, refusing to compromise on quality. It will fit any 13""/15""/16"" MacBook perfectly.Upgrade Your MacBook Pro/Air up to 4TBThe pop-up SSD connects MacBook wirelessly by built-in USB-C male port and can be used independently. To us, ""ready"" also means convenient: MagHub comes equipped with an SSD enclosure that is compatible with M.2 SATA SSD and NVME SSD, upgrading up to 4TB of memory. It is simple to set up and maintain, and data transfers are fast and safe.With Up to 1,000MB/s read and write speed, MagHub is compatible with both M.2 NVME 10Gbps and SATA SSD 5Gbps. With up to 4TB of available storage, you will get additional space to save all your media, data, game and program files and effectively boost your computing experience.MagHub equips M.2 SSD enclosure fitting NVMe PCIe M Key, SATA M Key and SATA B&M Key, applicable to sizes 22x42/ 22x60/ 22x80 solid state memory. Does not support AHCI PCIe SSD M Key and SATA SSD B Key.The magnetic attachment approach is so dependable, you never need to worry about vibration damage again. Start by removing the release liner of the PU tape, attaching the tape to your MacBook, and placing the MacBook on MagHub. MagHub attracts firmly with each other by strong magnetic force.MagHub supports dual 4K@60Hz monitors with Display 1: HDMI 2.0 + DP 1.4 and Display 2: HDMI 2.0, allowing resource-demanding applications to run on independent displays without affecting system performance.  *Note: MagHub supports TWO extended displays on MacBook Pro and MacBook Air with Intel chip and ONLY Single Display with Apple M1 Chip (M1 MacBook only supports one extend display).*Note: Because MagHub spends 15W power for SSD and other ports, the power shown in MacBook 16"" will be 85W. Energy Saving for MacBook BatteryWhile we want MagHub to represent power, we know that you need to be able to control how it works.

If your laptop is not listed, contact us… you’ll be surprised.  BOLD uses pass-through technology, allowing you to charge BOLD while it charges your devices. NEAT!   BOLD’s wireless pads are covered by tempered glass, making BOLD lighter and allowing it to cool faster. Our tempered glass is impact and scratch-resistant. Anywhere life takes you, BOLD won’t let you down. BOLD is made out of top quality aircraft grade anodized Aluminum. As a result, BOLD has excellent heat dissipation qualities and is lighter than traditional power banks.We've reimagined every way you interact with your devices and added utility, power, and strength. BOLD takes up half the volume of traditional Power Banks; now you can have the highest capacity and output Power Bank without carrying a ""brick"".     BOLD is approved by all major and minor airlines internationally. The maximum airline safe battery capacity for TSA/EASA is 27,000mAh / 100Wh. Disclaimer: some Asian Airlines such as Air Asia have a maximum of 20,000mAh /74Wh. 



 We started by defining the Power Bank capabilities and features. The critical task was how to fit so much power into an easily portable body. Many iterations were necessary to find the perfect balance between battery size, PCB positioning, and an optically appealing design. The global chip shortage notably slowed down our prototyping efforts and forced us to revisit our design time and time again. The final result is the perfect compromise between portability and functionality, and we cannot wait to receive your feedback.     Ready to preorder? Pick your starting pointWithin 14 days of your pledge, you will receive an email from Pledgebox to complete a shipping survey.  Taxes will be collected from backers in EU + EFTA, UK, AU, CA, and SG, as your respective governments impose them.As of July 1st, 2021 VAT applies from the first €1 of the product's price for products sold from outside the EU to consumers living inside the EU.As of January 1st, 2021 VAT applies from the first £1 of the product's price to products sold from outside the UK to consumers living inside the UK.To compensate for the VAT rates/taxes that your respective governments require, the UZE team decided to take a significant hit on shipping charges. Taxes and duties will be charged up-front for backers in EU + EFTA, UK, AU, CA, and SG, where applicable, meaning that the packages will arrive with all duties paid, enabling the best possible shipping experience.Available only on the survey     We use premium materials and manufacturing processes to build products that last. BOLD and all accessories pass rigorous tests to achieve international certifications of safe use. Our products are tested for: TEMPERATURE, CHARGE/DISCHARGE, DROP, SHAKING HUMIDITY, and STATIC.We comply with FCC, CE, RoHS, MSDS, and our lightning cables are MFi.Let us take you onto our journey of how BOLD by UZE came to be. In 2019, while on holiday in Europe, we went with friends to the beach. It was meant to be a quick stop and go, the last sunset and the culmination of the trip. We didn't carry much, and little did we expect what was about to happen. The car got stuck in the sand, and we had no charging cables, no Power Banks, and less than 5% battery on each phone. While it was enough to call for help, the phones eventually died, and everybody had to sleep the night in the car, as the towing truck was unable to call nor locate us. The temperature dropped, a blizzard came in, and the next day we had to walk for an hour until we found help.  Little did we know that we would sleep right thereLast Picture of the day Back in warm Miami we bought and tested countless Power Banks and found that all the features we wanted weren't available in one single product so we decided it was time to develop a Power Bank that would be a joy to carry around and that would be able to fast charge all devices, especially phones – cable or not.Since then almost 2 years have passed, and we are super excited to bring BOLD to Indiegogo after a very successful Kickstarter campaign. Capacity: 27000mAh / 100Wh Interface:

A note on why we went to Kickstarter and now IndiegogoWe launched products in Kickstarter because it gave us the freedom to run our business exactly how we want. The funds allow us to continue developing products without seeking outside investors. We love what we do and are not beholden to growth goals, revenue targets, or product timelines imposed by others. Instead, we focus on doing what we love: building the best things we can make, fueled by support from the best customers we could ask for.We cannot wait to get these products into your hands.",63.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>With email and messaging applications such as WhatsApp, Line, WeChat, Skype, LinkedIn and Facebook Messenger, there is a lot of typing required - and having a quality mobile keyboard is a must.  It's no longer just about swiping  or typing on a keyboard, making calls , taking photos or voice control - its about all of these actions!  And we need to be able to make these actions wherever and whenever we want.</p>
<p>In creating Astro Slide, we tried to incorporate many features that will make this device powerful enough to be the only device that you need to carry around with you.</p>
<p>Astro Slide allows you to work in restricted spaces comfortably, on planes on trains, in coffee bars. You can also hold the Astro and use it with ease as a passenger  in the car, standing up or on the bus.</p>
<p>It's the only device you need to carry - and small enough to fit in your pocket.</p>

We will be working with our factory in China and our designers in the UK to finalise mechanical engineering, PCB and radio electronics for the Astro. Having delivered both the Gemini PDA and Cosmo Communicator devices in less than a year we are proud of those achievement, but building any new product is a huge task and is a risky journey. Our team has experience of delivering both software and hardware. Our aim is to have the product available for shipping to the first backers of our campaign in March 2021. We have given this project an extra 2 month to deliver as it is our first 5G device. We know this is an ambitious target but one which we truly believe is achievable with our team in place. As such, we will be providing our backers with regular updates on Astro's progress.</p>

Media Coverage
 
The Planet story enters a new era...
At Planet Computers, we never stop innovating. Over the past two years, we have delivered our award-winning Gemini PDA and Cosmo Communicator devices to over ten thousand backers, who supported our mission to kickstart a new mobile computing revolution.
The revolution continues as we embrace the latest mobile technologies and trends, coupled with our passion for typing, writing, creating on the go.
We are extending the range of Planet devices with the brand new Astro Slide, our flagship 5G transformer smartphone.Once again, we have listened to our backers, who wanted more power, a large touchscreen always accessible, but also want to easy access to Planet’s signature backlit keyboard - without compromise.
We are fully embracing the power of 5G, and we decided to go “all in” to provide the ultimate 5G keyboard experience on the Astro. To have a smartphone that can transform into a pocket computer with simple thumb action is truly a leap in usability and functionality – great for both work and play.

 
It’s the ultimate in mobile design, power and usability.
Astro Slide is the first of Planet’s transformer smartphones with a large 6.39” touchscreen display.  Featuring Planet’s revolutionary patented RockUp slider hinge, Astro Slide reveals Planet’s signature keyboard at the push of thumb.
The display gently tilts up to the optimal viewing angle transforming Astro into a powerful pocket computer.

 
Astro Slide gives you the freedom to write, create, animate, communicate and be entertained in one familiar form factor.

 
Astro Slide is the first 5G phone device with a keyboard to be announced to date. Powered by MediaTek’s Dimensity 800 chipset with 8 super-fast cores plus advanced GPU and APU processors, it offers twice the performance of other 5G chipsets with significantly reduced power consumption, achieving download speeds of up to 2.39 Gb/s.

 
Astro Slide’s battery will power a user through an entire day of work and play.
Astro Slide also features Wi-Fi , Bluetooth 5,1 and NFC communications and wireless charging. Astro has a 48-megapixel rear facing Sony-sensor camera as well as a front camera for video calling.
 
 
A revolution in design
 

The Astro Slide and its RockUp™ hinge slider mechanism have been designed by Martin Riddiford.
Martin is the inventor of the clamshell mobile device and the designer behind all the Psion and Planet devices to date.
Astro Slide has a truly revolutionary design, offering the convenience of a smartphone, as well as laptop keyboard productivity – beautifully crafted in one device – all of it in the palm of your hand. It’s a no compromise solution and perfect as your daily driver.
Planet’s signature backlit keyboard allows you to comfortably work at night or in dark spaces such as on long plane journeys without the need of external lighting.

<h3>Introducing Loop.</h3>
<p>We love exploring on our bikes and smartphones let us do it quicker and easier than ever.  But all of the phone holders out there are cheap and bulky plastic holders or need special cases just to work.</p>
<p>In 2020 we created the original<i> Loop Mount</i>. A discreet phone mount to help you navigate and use apps safely but doesn’t compromise the look of your beloved bike. Since then, we’ve been sketching, riding and testing. And now we're back, with the<i><strong> Loop Mount Twist.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0499/8411/0782/files/Frame_Twist.gif"" src=""""/>  </strong></i></p>
<p>We listened to your feedback, and now you can use all your favourite phone navigation and training apps in either portrait or landscape mode. We’ve re-engineered the product, so, whatever phone or bike you use, across any route and even over the most challenging terrain, your handset will be secure, allowing you to focus safely on the journey.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0499/8411/0782/files/210605_animation_test_03.33_2.gif"" src=""""/></b></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><b>So, What's The Problem? </b></h3>
<p>We’re all guilty of using our phones en route to navigate, even though we know it's dangerous. Current phone holders on the market are ugly or need special cases just to work.</p>

<h3><b>By Cyclists, For Cyclists. </b></h3>

<h3><b>Any Phone, Any Bike, Any Journey.</b></h3>
<p>We wanted to make Loop Mount Twist for everyone, whatever their journey or setup.  It works with any mainstream smartphone, bike or bars.  There are a few exceptions, for things like aerobars and military style phone cases.</p>
<p>We designed Loop for every type of journey from road or dutch bikes to bumpy journeys on a gravel bike.  But we don't recommend it for mountain biking, doing jumps or BMX.</p>

</div></div>","Introducing Loop.
We love exploring on our bikes and smartphones let us do it quicker and easier than ever.  But all of the phone holders out there are cheap and bulky plastic holders or need special cases just to work.
In 2020 we created the original Loop Mount. A discreet phone mount to help you navigate and use apps safely but doesn’t compromise the look of your beloved bike. Since then, we’ve been sketching, riding and testing. And now we're back, with the Loop Mount Twist.
  
We listened to your feedback, and now you can use all your favourite phone navigation and training apps in either portrait or landscape mode. We’ve re-engineered the product, so, whatever phone or bike you use, across any route and even over the most challenging terrain, your handset will be secure, allowing you to focus safely on the journey.
 


 
So, What's The Problem? 
We’re all guilty of using our phones en route to navigate, even though we know it's dangerous. Current phone holders on the market are ugly or need special cases just to work.
    
 
By Cyclists, For Cyclists. 
At Loop, we’re cyclists first and foremost, which is why we designed a product that actually looked like it belonged on a bike.   
  


 
Any Phone, Any Bike, Any Journey.
We wanted to make Loop Mount Twist for everyone, whatever their journey or setup.  It works with any mainstream smartphone, bike or bars.  There are a few exceptions, for things like aerobars and military style phone cases.
We designed Loop for every type of journey from road or dutch bikes to bumpy journeys on a gravel bike.  But we don't recommend it for mountain biking, doing jumps or BMX.

 




 
Portrait Mode Is Now Built In.
The feedback we've had most, is, ""if only it worked in portrait mode"". So, we listened, tested, and created the twist feature. So, whether using google maps, Strava, or any other navigation on your smartphone, the portrait or landscape choice is yours. 
 

 
3KG Of Grip. 
It’s not just your bike that’s important to us, your phone is too. So, Loop Mount Twist secures it in place with 3kg’s of strong gripping force. Meaning the phone is safe, but not crushed. 
  
 
Built To Last A Lifetime.
This is not a plastic mount. We wanted to make a product that lasted a lifetime. So, we constructed Loop Mount Twist out of metal, using CNC technology, making it strong, whilst considering weight. Its versatility means that, if you change your bike, your Loop Mount Twist can move bikes with you.

Features and usage are getting more complex than ever before. The Volla Phone will help you find more time in a day and allows you to focus on really important things. The simplicity of pen and paper was the inspiration for this new phone. Rather than apps, people and content are the focus of its user interface. We live in a highly connected world.Most smartphones enable third party organizations to track and monitor almost everything that we do. As a result, we often get information that is preselected based on user profiles.With the Volla Phone, you decide with whom you share which information and from where you get your information. Its open-source operating system does not depend on any cloud service to function, protecting your privacy as you surf the internet. Meet The Volla PhoneTechnology made simple.Experience a simple user experience of the Volla OS with instant access to features and information without the need for apps. Just start writing and Volla knows what you want to do. We will introduce four new user experience concepts with our device: SpringboardStart writing on Volla’s home screen and forget apps. Springboard recognizes what you want to do and suggests completion of the text and appropriate activities, such as sending a short message, initiating a call, opening a Web page, or saving a note. ShortcutsCreate shortcuts for frequently used actions with a simple touch-drag-release gesture, making them more accessible.CollectionsThe Volla OS automatically groups people whom you contact the most frequent and most recent to call them quickly, write them a message, or review the latest thread of conversation with them. Further groupings contain the latest grouped messages and threads as well as news media grouped by source. You can easily filter old groupings by keywords.Quick MenuNo matter what you’re doing at any moment, you can access frequently used content and functions quickly via the Quick Menu. We will make best efforts to offer this  feature system-wide.Watch This Short Volla OS Demo Technology made secure.Experience artificial intelligence that respects your privacy. We don’t collect any data, track statistics, or ask you to set up a Volla user account if you want to use the Volla Phone. You get to decide who you want to share which parts of your life.Privacy ProtectionFor basic privacy protection the Volla Phone comes without Google Apps and Play Services or depending on a cloud service or user account. The Volla OS is based on the Android Open Source Project, which ensures compatibility with Android Apps and can be tested at any time by a community of software developers. In addition, the Volla OS includes curated core apps that are also open source and respect your privacy, including a secure browser and an alternative App StoreVirtual Private NetworkThe Volla Phone comes with a pre-installed VPN of the leading provider Hide.me to protect your privacy on the Internet.In addition, all supporters receive free premium access for one month and can then decide whether they want to continue with a premium or free access. Of course, all users are free to set up an alternative VPN provider of their choice.Beyond high availability and state-of-the-art encryption, the most important advantage of Hide.me is that the provider does not create logs of your visited pages and activities on the Internet.Check out the screenshots of the Hide.me app on our Volla Phone:   Technology made personalized.Select the Look You Want for Your Volla Phone. Choose alternatively to the elegant dark mode above a purist light mode or airy transparent:We are convinced that the future lies in an independent open source operating system. Therefore we want to give users not only the free choice to install such an operating system on their smartphone, but also the option to chose an pre-installed Ubuntu Touch operating system for the Volla Phone. Find our more below.For more convenience to change the operating system we use a recovery image with the popular TWRP app. We have already invested in a prototypical community port of Ubuntu Touch and Sailfish OS.  Volla Phone HardwareThe Volla Phone is available in an elegant shiny slate-grey or fresh also shiny white. We designed the Volla Phone for maximum functionality. 
An almost rimless 6.3” display provides a wider screen with a smaller frame.
“Made in Germany” from our experienced hardware partner Gigaset, the Volla Phone is durable enough to be your device for years.
The state-of-the-art 8-core processor guarantees a seamless user interface.
Enjoy colorful, high-quality photos and videos with a double rear camera and a high-resolution, 16-megapixel front camera.
Wireless charging allows for the ultimate user comfort.
Check out the specs of the Volla Phone: Volla Open Source ActivitiesTo ensure long-term simplicity and privacy protection, we see the importance of an independent, open source operating system.  Ubuntu Touch option for the Volla PhoneEspecially Ubuntu Touch, the mobile version of the widely used Ubuntu Linux distribution is promising due to its advanced development. Therefore we offer the choice for a pre-installed Ubuntu Touch on the volla Phone. Android apps and the Volla user experience will not yet be supported by Ubuntu touch for the Volla Phone. Visit the homepage of the Ubports foundation for more information about mobile Linux operating system.Screenshots of Ubuntu Touch on the Volla PHone Promoting a Sailfish OS Community PortWe have also already invested in a prototype of Sailfish OS for the Volla Phone and want to continue to support the development of a community port independently from this campaign. For licensing reasons we cannot offer a preinstalled Sailfish OS for the Volla Phone. Volla Phone With Volla OS, Sailfish OS and Ubuntu Touch Additional ProductsShirts (Male)

Android Police: “When you first see the Omega 200W, you won't believe that it actually delivers as much power as it does...”Idownloadblog: “This marks the first portable charger capable of outputting 200W.”Sun Herald: “They won't weigh you down...”Yahoo: “200W Omega boasts not only higher output but also greater support for more charging protocols”Press Features Featured by MrWhosTheBoss UK's biggest tech blogger   With 200W of power, there's always more than enough power to share around with 4 ports: 2 x USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 and 2 x USB-A (supporting QC3.0, AFC, VOOC, SCP & FCP).      Matching worldwide travel adapters available in matching charger colours. These are specially designed travel adapters with a very secure unique locking mechanism. This meansyou can use the plugs on ANY US 2-pront plug from any device- giving you perfect convenience so you never have to bring travel adapters for any of your US devices.  Both 200W and 100W Omega Charger supports 100V - 240V worldwide universal voltage and comes included with 3 plug converters (AU/EU/UK) so that you can use it in 200+ countries worldwide. Please note the adapters can be interchanged between the 200W and 100W models though due to different shapes, it will stick out a little.   The portability and high power means you will never need another charger for USB charging needs.  A world's first 200W portable charger provides the ability to quick charge a laptop (16"" MacBook Pro), a tablet (iPad Pro), smartphone (iPhone), and mobile device (AirPods, Watch) all at the same time.   With 2 x 100W USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 PPS ports, a single 200W Omega charger can power 2 laptops (16"" MacBook Pro) simultaneously, and at full speed. This is a gamechanger in charger technology, making it the first portable charger in the world to output 200W.   Omega Charger USB-A ports are compatible with a wide range of devices that support Quick Charge 3.0, AFC, VOOC, SCP, FCP almost all major fast charging protocols in the market from all major brands including Samsung, Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Oneplus up to 22.5W.   At only 220g (0.49lb), you can easily fit 200W Omega Charger into any pocket and bring it with you wherever you go.  The 100W Omega is even smaller and lighter at 120g (0.26lb) at 81% less volume than a 100W Apple charger, giving you unrivalled portability.     200W Omega charger is the world's first charger to features our patent-pending 2-way foldable prongs which can be adjusted at a 90° or 180° angle allowing you to fit Omega charger into any tough to fit wall plug whether its a floor or wall plug.       The 100W Omega is so small its smaller than a credit card and comparable to a pack of Eclipse mints. The perfect portable charger for work, home and travel.    

 
By popular demand we're introducing the world's first GaN charger with a detachable C7 adapter. The C7 adapter for 200W Omega will debut for $11 and include a complimentary 1m (3.3ft) cable in your choice of AU/EU/UK or US plug.This means you can charge 200W Omega anywhere in the world with a C7 plug, commonly used with household appliances & electronics worldwide.The addition of the C7 adapter means Omega can be easily reachable in all those difficult to access spots where wall sockets are hidden. We personally like to have the charger on the table and the C7 connector will allow that flexibility & easy access. Updated Smaller C7 Design  C7 adapter attached to 65W, 100W and 200W OmegaThe C7 adapter comes in 1 size for all chargers.  Black C7 adapter comes with a black C7 cable.White or Navy & Gold C7 adapter comes with a white C7 cable.You'll be able to add-on the C7 adapter during the BackerKit survey phase which will be emailed to you 14 days after the campaign has ended.    200W Design  Chargeasap has spent over 8 months perfect the internal circuitry and firmware, taking care to upgrade user experience and ensure the final product maximised the use of the Navitas GaNFast NV6127 power ICs. The NV6127 is the latest GaN power chip from Navitas and has superior heat dissipation, and is the powertrain in a high-frequency quasi-resonant (HFQR) flyback topology – a high-efficiency, cost-optimized GaN structure.In order to make the smallest 100W and 200W charger ever, the circuit board and components are laid out in a very compact and space-efficient manner. By incorporating only industry-leading components we can deliver superior performance in a pocket-sized charger. The dense circuit board is then surrounded by high-density, thin heat sinks to aid in heat dissipation. An industry-first graphene membrane is strategically wrapped around major charger components to further aid in cooling. The charger is then wrapped in a minimalist fire-resistant polycarbonate (PC) and Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) enclosure to complete the design.  Getting to this final form factor was no easy task; we worked with 6 different factories over a year leading to a lot of funds being used in mold fees that weren't eventualized, and all but one failing to create the product in the perfect portable size we were after.   100W Design  Earlier Samples of 200W & 100W   Omega is a big leap for the world of GaN chargers. With improved features including the latest Navitas GaN power IC, graphene membrane and accurate power distribution, the Omega Chargers are proud to be a pioneer in being the world's first second generation GaN chargers solving issues found commonly in first generation GaN chargers.Kickstarter backers are early adopters, and assisted Chargeasap to optimize and upgrade Omega performance above earlier designs. A survey of 4,538 respondents (previous Chargeasap backers) in July 2020 was used to highlight any earlier issues and provide a laser-focus for our design team to optimize:
Cool, full-power operation
On-demand, stable, accurate power-sharing between outputs
High quality & reliability
 Thank you to every respondent as your feedback has allowed us to create a charger that fixed the painpoints of limited chargers available today.   To optimize GaN for high speed, high efficiency and high reliability, Navitas created GaNFast power ICs. Here, the GaN power switch (FET) is carefully, monolithically integrated with GaN logic and GaN analog circuits on a single GaN chip to form a true GaN power IC. These ‘digital-in power-out’ building blocks - known as GaNFast™ power ICs – deliver robust, high-efficiency performance up to 2 MHz.The 200W Omega is the first portable charger in the world to feature not one but two GaNFast NV6127s - designed by Navitas in Los Angeles, California - enabling the 200W power to be reached with minimal heat and maximum efficiency.  One of the big advantages of GaN technology is its superior AC-DC efficiency – over 92%. Omega loses 15% less energy than Apple and Anker, resulting in cool case temperatures, even at full power – anywhere in the world (measured at 110V and 220V inputs). Competitor product: Hyperjuice Laboratory Testing Calculation: Input power = 106.4W, output power = 19.576V x 5A = 97.88W, so efficiency is 97.88/106.4 = 92%Tested in our lab under the same conditions, the 100W Hyperjuice reaches only 88% at 110V, which is a 33% increase in energy loss – a much higher case temperature Official GaNFast PartnerChargeasap is proud to partner with Navitas Semiconductor and utilize the high-speed, high-efficiency performance of GaNFast power ICs. GaNFast technology has been adopted by industry leaders including Lenovo, Xiaomi and OPPO.  Navitas is the world’s first & only GaN Power IC company, founded in 2014. Navitas has a strong and growing team of power semiconductor industry experts with a combined 300 years of experience in materials, devices, applications, systems and marketing, plus a proven record of innovation. Over 100 Navitas patents are issued or pending.  One of Omega's pioneering technologies is being the first charger to include a graphene membrane which is like a ribbon cooling sheet that's been carefully interlaced within the internal components to dissipate heat. This feature is combined with a high density nano heat sink commonly found in 1st generation GaN chargers which together ensure true heat dissipation particularly when used with high wattage devices.  The industry standard for charger maximum temperature is 130ºC internally and 65ºC externally. Both 100W Omega and 200W Omega will remain below 110ºC internally and 60ºC externally due to superior components include a more advanced GaN IC and the inclusion of a graphene membrane ribbon sheet.  We've completed extensive factory testing on GaN competitors to ensure if they are coming clean with their claims. The world's 1st 100W multi-output GaN charger can be seen here reaching 76.9°C externally, which suggests an internal temperature in excess of 130°C. Note the test was only performed on 1 unit and was the competitor's brand earlier production, it's possible future production runs could have improvements that fixed this issue.   One of the flaws of 1st Generation multi-ouput GaN chargers is their lack of accurate intelligent power distribution. By not limiting the USB-C port when the USB-A port is used, its easy to confuse the charger which is why many competitor brand users have experienced many issues with their charger not working to their expectations. The solution is to specify the limit for each port and ensure they are independent, so there is no preference for power. Furthermore the true solution is to increase the output of the charger and hence the 200W GaN Charger will not fail to output 100W power for each of the 2 USB-C ports when multiple devices are connected.200W Power Distribution 
C1 or C2 = 100W
C1 + C2 = 100W + 100W
C1+ A1 + A2 = 100W + 12w + 12W
C1+ C2 + A1 = 65W + 100W + 22.5W
C1+ C2+  A2 = 65W + 100W + 22.5W
C1+ A2 or C2+ A1 = 100W + 22.5W
C1+ A1 or C2+ A2 = 65W + 22.5W
A1+ A2 = 12W + 12W 
A1 or A2 = 22.5W
4 ports used simultaneously: 100W+ 65W + 12W +12W
Our 200W Omega has a laptop-first power distribution which means the C2 port will also be prioritised at 100W to ensure your laptop will always charge as fast as possible and not be interupted by devices being plugged or unplugged.100W Power Distribution 
C1 or C2: 100W
C1 + C2: 65W + 30W
C1 + A1: 65W + 22.5W
C2 + A1: 12W + 12W
A1: 22.5W
When 3 ports used simultaneously: 65W + 12W + 12W
Fast RecalibrationOne of the shortfalls of current GaN chargers is a long recalibration time. This means when there is a device plugged into 1 USB-C port and you plug in another port it will not work for a few seconds. 
100W Omega has a recalibration time of 0.5sec across all ports.
200W Omega has 0 recalibration time between C1 and C2 and 0.5sec for the A ports.
This is vs Hyperjuice which from our testing has a recalibration time of 3sec as it uses 1 circuit for all the ports rather than dedicated circuits for each USB-C port.   Proof of Concept Video  Video showing 200W Omega being plugged into a wall socket and outputting 2 x 100W from each USB-C port into the wattage tester.   From the Team that brought you Flash: World's Fastest Charging 100W USB-C Power BankWe haven't forgotten about our Flash backers, Omega Charger is designed to be paired with Flash 1.0 & 2.0, ensuring the full 100W to enable the fastest powerbank charge time in the world at only 70 minutes.

   200W Colour Options  100W Colour Options   Laptop Head Add ons  Following the popularity of the laptop adapter heads with Flash we're giving Omega backers the option to purchase these adapters which convert a USB-C cable into a laptop input for a range of laptops. Available for $19 each.If you'd like to purchase a combination of 200W and 100W Omega, you can do so waiting until you are emailed a survey 14 days after the campaign finished from BackerKit where you can:
Add-on a charger at the same discounted rate
Purchase additional add-ons from our Chargeasap range
Lock in your color choices
Confirm your shipping address
  All rewards will be delivered via air freight directly from our distribution centre in Shenzhen, China. Backers are also expected to receive rewards between 4-20 days from shipping depending on the size of the delivery and your country (including USA). We've chosen this costlier method so no matter what country you're supporting from you don't have the long transportation times of sea freight. Why We Need Your Support We've already started production and are on schedule to delivery by January 2021. Here's some photos of the production line showing the final completed products.     Chargeasap is a consumer electronics startup originating from Sydney with a global team who believe users should be the creators and innovators of products. We realize that your mobile phone is the one object you interact with every day more than any other object or person, so why not simplify this interaction?Our mission is to create highly innovative phone accessories that simplifies the way you interact with your mobile devices.Our team consists of serial entrepreneurs, creatives and engineers who've worked together since 2015 to overcome painstaking obstacles to bring to life the vision of each life-changing product. Our international team is spread across the world from Sydney- Down Under to Bali- Indonesia, Shenzhen- China, Dubai- UAE and California- LA.  We're a startup that is backed only by ourselves. We have no external investors. Instead we launch products through the magic of crowd funding. The funds raised here will not only go towards manufacturing, they'll also help us to design future products.We've already had 8 previous successful campaigns, raising over $4.5 million and delivering to more than 130 countries.  Our previous campaigns have been featured in hundreds of major publications and online media worldwide garnering over 150m views. Thank you for your early support of Omega! The last USB charger you'll ever need.   Risks and challengesThis is Chargeasap's 9th crowdfunding project. We've got plenty of experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality mobile phone accessories and fulfilled 130,000+ orders. We've also been blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues with manufacturing and shipping and always dealt with them in a way that leaves every last customer happy with their purchase and proud to support our company. In short, we know what we're doing, and you should be very confident that we will deliver what we say we will, when we say we will. And we solemnly swear that should unforeseen issues come up, we will handle them with the utmost transparency and care for you, our backers. We have already created the mold, so it's very unlikely for any reason that the December delivery won't be on schedule. Supply Chain Risk: We're incredibly proud of our supply chain partners, and have worked with them for over 3 years developing strong relationships. In saying that, unseen circumstances do occur. Sometimes 8 shipping containers of product get stuck outside a shipyard for 3 weeks due to customs or other clearance issues. We've accounted for potential delays in our schedule, but sometimes not enough. We've been battling Covid since 2020 and have accounted for any potential delays.",87.0,6,"10 Campaigns

Meet with Mojo68! This custom and programmable mechanical keyboard provide in 6 wild styles, with keycaps in 3 profiles, and 5 types of switches. It allows you to fully customize and build your very own keyboard that perfectly fits your personal preferences.   Integrating a breakthrough transparent chassis design and unique internal gasket-mount layout makes Mojo68 truly one of a kind. Mojo68 by MelGeek ushers in a New Era of Mechanical Keyboard! It’s time to evolve beyond the boring keyboards of the past and make typing an enjoyable experience.  
 
 
 
 

 
 
  Gasket Mount The internal mounting style of a keyboard affects the way it feels and performs. Mojo68 uses an advanced Gasket Mount style. The keyboard plate is surrounded by silicone and Poron, which creates a more comfortable, elastic feel and dampened sound.   Silicon is used as a shock absorber which prevents the plate from directly contacting other components of the keyboard. This way, it can substantially reduce the vibration created from keystrokes for a comfortable, elastic feel that reduces strain and pressure on your fingers during long typing sessions.   Poron is also a significant internal layer of Mojo68 and it is used as an extra cushion. Hitting the keys while typing generates a high-energy impact with each keystroke. Poron is an ideal urethane foam for keyboard cushioning, managing the energy and dampening sound at the same time. It also provides a softer press feel and gives Mojo68 excellent performance for long term use.   
   Hot-SwappableMojo68 is hot-swappable, allowing you to easily swap, upgrade, and mix switches without soldering. You can DIY it in your way and change it at any time!  Custom Switches & Keycaps   Everyone has his or her own preference on the press feel and sound of the keyboard. So we offer 5 different switches including White, Silver, Brown, Blue, & Yellow Pro from Gateron. Golden Pink, Speed Silver & Blueish White from TTC are available as add-ons. Select the one that suits you the best!  
 
 
    APP ControlWith our exclusive APP, KBTools, you can personalize Mojo68 as you choose including function keys, backlights, and shortcut settings. Add layers for extra functions and expand up to 4 FN function keys.   These features let you optimize your control for gaming and bring you a brand-new, better typing experience. Our wired version also supports QMK and you can also program it and explore for more fun!  
 
  Each key has its own RGB backlight! Using KBTOOLS, you can set up the colors and rhythm in the way you want and match up the backlighting with your mood every day. Infinite combinations let you go wild with color!  
 
 
   Compatible with Mac, Windows, IOS, and Android, Mojo68 adopts Tri-mode connection including Bluetooth, 2.4G USB Wireless, and Type-C wired connection.  
 
 It allows you to pair with up to 4 devices and switch seamlessly between them to help with multi-tasking and boosting your productivity. Just simply press FN + 1 or 2 or 3 or 4, you can easily switch from your PC to tablet, cell phone, or laptop. Enjoy total control for all your devices.

We ran into issues with shipping, quality control, and lost quite a bit of money in those departments. Rest assured, we have learned so much from the twists and turns of production, that we are confident we can deliver an even higher quality product, on time, and on budget. However, to do so, we will need funding in order to make tooling adjustments, and fulfill the orders. With the expenses for the product assembly, plus the advertising costs for this campaign, we won't be making profit from the Kickstarter. It is a project that will simply launch Tstand2 into the world, and show the world the 'iPad experience perfected' (not to mention smartphone, Kindle, Switch, etc) We hope to grow the company in the future through retail sales, and merchandising. The future scalability of the product is where the profit is, and we know that... but the KS campaign is where the fun is, so we look forward to you joining us on this great adventure. Thanks for the massive enthusiasm and support. Looking forward to a great TSTAND2 campaign! Risks and challengesWith the first version of our product, we gained a lot of new experience in tooling, inventory and logistics. While the funding goal was greatly exceeded, nothing went to waste. We encountered obstacles —expensive ones — but overcame them, and we always kept our backers in touch concerning any delay. There were some financial losses in the 1.0, but we refused to let those losses effect our backers. We were, and are intent on delivering on our promises no matter what. We now have a long-term relationship with the manufacturing partners who have worked on Tstand. This is invaluable. The tooling required is already available and we afforded to do a 'prototype' production run at our own expense: a small scale, real world manufacturing of the new Tstand 2, to make sure that the final design is affordable and up to our standards when built. We can't wait to scale up to thousands of units. The real challenge is now to politely ask people to give as much love as possible to the new Tstand 2! As we are currently in a state of global pandemic, it may be harder and more time-consuming for us to travel and perform quality control. Furthermore, the delays with most postal services have slowed a bit. There is some risk here, but we promise to be attentive and on top of it every step of the way.",47.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In previous versions of Mokibo 2019, the entire keyboard was a trackpad. With this design, you have to remove the left hand from the keyboard to use the trackpad. With the new Mokibo Folio, only the right side is used as the trackpad. Therefore, you can leave your left hand on the keyboard while using the trackpad with your right hand.</p>

<p>Mokibo Folio feels like a standard laptop keyboard because that’s what it is. The trackpad is conveniently hidden underneath the right half of the keyboard saving space and minimizing hand movements. Slide your fingers over the keys and see the mouse cursor magically move. The mouse pointer won’t move when you’re typing thanks to the automatic mode recognition algorithm. </p>

<p>Delivery of rewards/perks are subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Previously, we ran a successful crowdfunding campaign with our first model of Mokibo and delivered to all backers. You can pledge with confidence based on our track record. We will also deliver a product that has been perfected though addressing all the feedbacks we got from the first model we mass produced. And we are now launching a Mokibo Folio for iPad users with upgraded features and quality. However, please note that our product is only at the pilot production stage, so some minor design and functional modifications may be applied. It will work properly with iPadOS 13 or later and most Windows, Android, macOS, and iOS devices. However, some devices that are not an iPad Pro may be unstable with some fuctions or the Bluetooth connectivity. It is important to understand that unexpected things may happen along the way, which are very hard to predict now. For example, delays in shipping can occur due to factors like viruses, travel restrictions, even trade wars, or other manufacturing challenges. Like many, we have been contending with the uncertainties of COVID-19. We’ve decided to manufacture in South Korea where we are based to ensure quality and timely delivery. If any delays were to occur due to any circumstances, we will diligently update all our backers with full transparency. We will do our utmost to eliminate any of doubts you may have along the way. Customer service and communication are of great importance to us and we will make sure to keep you updated throughout the campaign and production.</p></figure></div>
</div></div>","Mokibo is a full-size keyboard in which the keyboard surface also functions as a trackpad. Your fingers don't have to leave the keyboard to move the mouse cursor.
 

 
In previous versions of Mokibo 2019, the entire keyboard was a trackpad. With this design, you have to remove the left hand from the keyboard to use the trackpad. With the new Mokibo Folio, only the right side is used as the trackpad. Therefore, you can leave your left hand on the keyboard while using the trackpad with your right hand.
 

 

 
A precision touch sensor is located under the right half of the keyboard. Our technology automatically distinguishes between keyboard mode and mouse mode so that the mouse does not move while using the keyboard.
 

 

 
Mokibo uses a pantograph keyboard, which is the most widely used type of keyboard in laptop computers, so it will have a familiar feel--providing comfort and enabling fast typing. The key travel distance is 1.3 to 1.5mm which is the most desirable distance for laptop computers.
 

 
 

 



*Mokibo folio Universal is not a tablet PC keyboard case. It is just a portable keyboard with folio protector. Mokibo folio for iPad Pro 11"" and 12.9"" are iPad Pro keyboard case which fit to iPad Pro device. 
 

 
We successfully crowdfunded our first version of the portable dual function Mokibo keyboard with the integrated trackpad surface in the US, Korea, and Japan and we produced in 2019. Building on the 2019 version, the 2020 Mokibo Folio will feature greatly improved keyboard feel and touch sensitivity.

Keyboard + Trackpad
 
Mokibo Folio feels like a standard laptop keyboard because that’s what it is. The trackpad is conveniently hidden underneath the right half of the keyboard saving space and minimizing hand movements. Slide your fingers over the keys and see the mouse cursor magically move. The mouse pointer won’t move when you’re typing thanks to the automatic mode recognition algorithm. 

 
 
Scroll
 
You can scroll using two fingers just as you would a standard trackpad. Smoothness is comparable to that of trackpads/mice from leading brands.

 Wide Touch Area   
 
The hidden Mokibo Folio trackpad is almost three times larger than some premium trackpads, so you don't have to rub the trackpad multiple times to move the pointer to where you want it. 

 
 
 Pairing with up to 3 devices via Bluetooth 
 
Mokibo can be paired with up to three devices at the same time via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). One Mokibo can be switched from one device to another on your desk with the tap of a key. You can select one of the three devices by pressing the Fn key and one of the F9-F11 keys simultaneously. 

 
 
Support iPad, iPhone, Mac, Android, and Windows
 
Mokibo supports not only iPad OS but also supports iOS, MacOS, Android, and Windows. You can pair with up to three heterogeneous devices. You can switch the OS by pressing the Fn and F12 keys simultaneously. The selected OS is saved and there is no need to select every time unless the device is changed.  

 
 
 Multi-angle Stand 
 
The Mokibo cover allows for a variety of screen angles including the optimum angle for Apple pencil use. Only Mokibo folio for iPad Pro 11"" and 12.0"" support Multi-angle stand feature.


 
Multimedia keys
 
Mokibo includes a row of multimedia keys placed right above the row of numeric keys. The ESC key and F1-F12 key for Windows OS are available here. The multimedia keys include the virtual keyboard on/off button, media control keys, volume control keys, screen capture key, backlight control key, device selection keys, OS selection key, and battery check key.

 
 Keyboard size 
 
The Mokibo folio for iPad Pro 12.9"" has a full sized keyboard with a key pitch of 19mm, and the Mokibo folio for iPad Pro 11"" and Mokibo folio Universal have a semi-full sized keyboard with a key pitch of 18mm. 

 *Mokibo folio Universal is not a tablet PC keyboard case. It is just a portable keyboard with folio protector. Mokibo folio for iPad Pro 11"" and 12.9"" are iPad Pro keyboard case which fit to iPad Pro device. 
 
Ultra-portable | Thin and Light
 
Mokibo uses a lightweight yet solid material to maximize the portability of your smart device. The side with the keyboard is 6mm, and the opposite cover is only 1.6mm. It weighs only  290grams for Mokibo folio Universal,  440 grams for iPad Pro 11"", 545grams for iPad Pro 12.9"". 
For Mokibo folio Universal - Mokibo folio Universal is NOT a keyboard case for tablet PC but a portable keyboard with folio cover to protect the keyboard itself. 
 

 
For Mokibo folio for iPad Pro 11"" and 12.9"" - Mokibo folio for iPad Pro 11"" and 12.9"" are a keyboard case for iPad Pro 11"" and 12.9"" so that it covers iPad Pro 11"" and 12.9"".

Mokibo is the thinnest, lightest, and widest trackpad in its class because the keyboard itself serves as the trackpad. Multi-functional components necessitate less parts and allow for a more competitive price.  
 

 

 

 
 

 
We will conduct a survey before mass production begins to tally up how many of each language we need to produce. To start, we guarantee to support the twelve languages/layouts shown below. If there is any other language/layout requested by more than 300 backers, we will officially support it.
 
1. US        2. Korean     3. UK       4. German     5. French      6. Russian      7. Japanese      
8. Spanish      9. Italian     10. Swiss German     11. Taiwan        12 . Thailand 
* Please request the language you desire during the survey. 
 

We're making an Apple Pencil holder as a separate accessory. The final design has yet to be finalized and two models are currently being tested. When the sample is complete, I will ask you for your opinion and make a decision.

Risks and challenges
Previously, we ran a successful crowdfunding campaign with our first model of Mokibo and delivered to all backers. You can pledge with confidence based on our track record. We will also deliver a product that has been perfected though addressing all the feedbacks we got from the first model we mass produced. And we are now launching a Mokibo Folio for iPad users with upgraded features and quality. However, please note that our product is only at the pilot production stage, so some minor design and functional modifications may be applied. It will work properly with iPadOS 13 or later and most Windows, Android, macOS, and iOS devices. However, some devices that are not an iPad Pro may be unstable with some fuctions or the Bluetooth connectivity. It is important to understand that unexpected things may happen along the way, which are very hard to predict now. For example, delays in shipping can occur due to factors like viruses, travel restrictions, even trade wars, or other manufacturing challenges. Like many, we have been contending with the uncertainties of COVID-19. We’ve decided to manufacture in South Korea where we are based to ensure quality and timely delivery. If any delays were to occur due to any circumstances, we will diligently update all our backers with full transparency. We will do our utmost to eliminate any of doubts you may have along the way. Customer service and communication are of great importance to us and we will make sure to keep you updated throughout the campaign and production.",89.0,8,"3 Campaigns

Based on our survey, most people prefer to have a faster-charging speed for their smartphone as this is the devices they use from day to night. Moreover, 60W is sufficient for most laptops for light to medium work and it can still charge decently fast for bigger laptop like Macbook Pro 16"" or XPS 17"".  Thus we've decided to opt for the 60W + 18W Apple Fast Charge configuration.

This innovation allows the cable to withstand the toughest use under any situation and environment. The woven exterior of the cable not only provides crucial structural integrity that could prevent tearing and fraying from everyday use, it also helps it withstand extreme forms of punishment. Doesn’t matter if you are skiing in the alps, riding through the Sahara desert or on the ocean facing rough winds, Zeus-X will be ready and operational to help you keep your devices charged and data transferred.Super strong and durable with up to 15,000 bending lifespanBefore realizing our dream of building the perfect cable, me and my team had multiple cables which works great but would get worn down so quick after multiple uses that we would have to buy new ones every year. When we started this project, we took it personal to see that the cable that we made would be made of the best quality components and fabric that would be able to withstand heavy uses under all situations for a long period of time. After testing more than 20 types of fabric, materials and weave patterns, we found the perfect combination which incorporates quality, flexibility, durability and strength. This material provide our cable with over 15,000+ of bending lifespan and still works like a charm!We have utilized our experience and expertise to make our cablePowerful - Zeus-X uses 20 AWG copper wires - A much thicker and more powerful copper wire, allowing it to carry more current across the cable and thus charge 3x faster than conventional 1A/ 28AWG cable! Longer Lasting - The tinned copper core provides anti-corrosion properties which make the cable last much longer even in environments with high moisture and humidity. This is commonly used in marine appliances and cables to extend their lifespan. Stable - The internal of the cable is coated with an aluminium foil to minimize external interference, ensuring a smooth and stable charging and data transfer.Safe - Thanks to its 20AWG copper core, Zeus-X has a very small electrical resistance across the cable ; thus minimizing heat lost and prevent overheating. The external TPE fire retardant plastic will ensure the cable never catch on fire.Note: AWG stands for American Wire Gauge - It is a U.S. standard set of non-ferrous wire conductor sizes. In summary, it is a measurement of the diameter of the copper wire in a cable. Lower AWG represent thicker and bigger wire diameter(Better, just like Zeus-X's 20AWG). Need a quick data transfer on the go? Zeus-X got you covered!Unlike multi cables currently on the market that only focuses on charging, we at Futurizta Tech have made so that Zeus-X supports stable and secure high speed data transfer across different devices including Android Smartphone, IOS devices, GoPro, Camera and much more!* Support Android Auto and Apple Carplay. Based on numerous tests and trial runs, we have made an improved smart chip which further protects and supports fast data transfer. The new smart chip runs on an adaptive algorithm that regulates the amount of power that runs through the cable to ensure that you would have the fastest data and power transfer speed available without compromising your safety and security. This smart chip allow Zeus-X to charge various gadgets ranging from small appliances such a smartwatch to power-hungry laptops with the appropriate power to ensure fast and secure charging! Big companies tries to sell you 6 cables separately to maximize their profit whereas we just want to make your life easier. Why buy 6 cables and clutter up your bag and workspace when you can get one cable to do everything for all at such an affordable price!Goodbye Messy Cable!

It possesses some unique properties that make it an excellent semiconductor, touted as the most suitable replacement for silicon. With wide-ranging applications in consumer electronics; from microwave ovens, blu-ray discs to chargers, chances are that your next piece of electronics could be powered by GaN.</p><p>Gallium Nitride is a wide band gap semiconductor, meaning it can operate at higher voltage and temperature ranges than conventional semiconductors like silicon. The GaN crystalline structure is also low-resistance allowing for very high electron mobility, and this is why it is now being widely adopted in chargers as a very small fraction of conducted electricity is lost to heat, giving more energy to power your devices.</p><p>GaN now makes it possible for high-voltage electrical components to be packed closely together without overheating. In essence, you can get a pocket-sized 200W charger with multi-outlets capable of providing a full charge for your MacBook Pro 16"" (96W), iPhones, iPads and Android devices (65W). Unlike older silicon models, GaN chargers are now equipped with smart chips and Power Delivery technology that ensures your device is only getting the right amount of power it needs for an optimum charge.In a modern, fast-paced world where most things are done on the go, size matters. So you don't need to pack multiple bulky chargers for laptops, phones and cameras. The <strong>VOLTA GIGA GaN </strong>charger offers you that portability without compromising on power.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1812/3983/files/Screen_Shot_2021-09-29_at_10.33.29_pm.png?v=1632951249?v=1632657143"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1812/3983/files/Anchor_2nd.jpg?v=1632951331"" src=""""/><br/><strong>VOLTA Anchor</strong> 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger Stand</p><p>Simultaneously Charge 3 devices: iPhones (8/X/11/12/13), AirPods/Apple Watch &amp; ALL Qi wireless Smartphones (Androids).

It possesses some unique properties that make it an excellent semiconductor, touted as the most suitable replacement for silicon. With wide-ranging applications in consumer electronics; from microwave ovens, blu-ray discs to chargers, chances are that your next piece of electronics could be powered by GaN.Gallium Nitride is a wide band gap semiconductor, meaning it can operate at higher voltage and temperature ranges than conventional semiconductors like silicon. The GaN crystalline structure is also low-resistance allowing for very high electron mobility, and this is why it is now being widely adopted in chargers as a very small fraction of conducted electricity is lost to heat, giving more energy to power your devices.GaN now makes it possible for high-voltage electrical components to be packed closely together without overheating. In essence, you can get a pocket-sized 200W charger with multi-outlets capable of providing a full charge for your MacBook Pro 16"" (96W), iPhones, iPads and Android devices (65W). Unlike older silicon models, GaN chargers are now equipped with smart chips and Power Delivery technology that ensures your device is only getting the right amount of power it needs for an optimum charge.In a modern, fast-paced world where most things are done on the go, size matters. So you don't need to pack multiple bulky chargers for laptops, phones and cameras. The VOLTA GIGA GaN charger offers you that portability without compromising on power.VOLTA Anchor 3-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger StandSimultaneously Charge 3 devices: iPhones (8/X/11/12/13), AirPods/Apple Watch & ALL Qi wireless Smartphones (Androids).

<p>As technology continues to make devices smaller and lighter, chargers and batteries are naturally required to be smaller as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nowadays, various devices such as the iPhone 12 are compatible with 20W chargers, and the MI MacBooks are also becoming more compact while requiring higher output, meanings chargers and mobile batteries also need to have more capacity than before.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://connectinternationalone.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/4-1.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, achieving high power in chargers and mobile batteries requires a lot of electrical energy.</p>
<p>In the case of mobile batteries, it depends on the capacity of the battery cell (battery) that supplies the power and the technology used to manufacture the battery. As a result, in most cases, high-power batteries remain large, heavy, and difficult to carry around.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611550545/o1cbtsmag8tdmeumc1u5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The SMARTCOBY Pro 30W makes use of the same high power density battery cells used in Tesla cars, compressing energy to the limit to produce a compact, high-power battery.</p>

<p>What do you think the most important quality for a portable power bank is? We believe the answer is compactness, as if a power bank is too bulky, you won’t want to carry it around with you, and you will end up leaving it at home.</p>
<p>SMARTCOBY Pro 30W fits in your palm, but it is also powerful. You can easily put it in your bag or pocket and carry it around all day. Compared to other models with the same specifications, SMARTCOBY Pro is the smallest you can buy while maintaining a high output.</p>

<p>SMARTCOBY, a credit-card-sized power bank that has been supported by over 1,000 people on Makuake, a Japanese crowdfunding site. SMARTCOBY has upgraded and become ""SMARTCOBY Pro 30W,"" with higher output!</p>
<p>CIO was founded by a Shodai, who was born in 1990 in Osaka, Japan. While working for a Japanese IT company as a new graduate in 2011, he started importing and using gadgets from overseas to make his work environment and daily life more convenient.</p>
<p>But as he started using these foreign tools more, he realized how limited each device was, and that he had to own multiple chargers to power up his laptop, smartphone, music player, etc. As a result, he had more devices than he knew what to do with, and was constantly wasting time looking for the right charger for the right device. </p>
<p>Realizing that other people must be having the same problem, Shodai starting thinking about how to combine multiple functions in a single product, while also using the latest technology. When he couldn’t find such devices elsewhere, he decided to start manufacturing his own products. </p>
<p>With this idea in mind, CIO was established in 2017 as a manufacturer dedicated to creating devices that would set new standards of multi-functionality while also using the most advanced technologies. </p>
<p>CIO started out selling its products exclusively on Japanese e-commerce sites, but has expanded and now services a wide range of major Japanese electronics retailers, home centers, and supermarkets, and more than one million people have now used our products.</p>

Product Review

 
*This video has subtitles. You can choose the language in the subtitle settings.

 

As technology continues to make devices smaller and lighter, chargers and batteries are naturally required to be smaller as well.
 
Nowadays, various devices such as the iPhone 12 are compatible with 20W chargers, and the MI MacBooks are also becoming more compact while requiring higher output, meanings chargers and mobile batteries also need to have more capacity than before.
 

 
However, achieving high power in chargers and mobile batteries requires a lot of electrical energy.
In the case of mobile batteries, it depends on the capacity of the battery cell (battery) that supplies the power and the technology used to manufacture the battery. As a result, in most cases, high-power batteries remain large, heavy, and difficult to carry around.
The SMARTCOBY Pro 30W makes use of the same high power density battery cells used in Tesla cars, compressing energy to the limit to produce a compact, high-power battery.
 

 
SMARTCOBY Pro is by far the most compact and portable battery, especially compared to conventional batteries that support more than 30W.







 



 
You can charge your smartphone, tablet devices, and even your laptop. It supports PD30W charging, so M1 MacBooks can be charged too.
 
It can also be used as a power source when working in cafes, when working from home, or when working remotely.
 

 
Its compact size and high power output makes it easy to carry around, and it will not disturb you if you use it for game consoles or other devices.
 

 
It has both 30W output and low current mode, so you can use it for many devices.
 

 


 
What do you think the most important quality for a portable power bank is? We believe the answer is compactness, as if a power bank is too bulky, you won’t want to carry it around with you, and you will end up leaving it at home.
SMARTCOBY Pro 30W fits in your palm, but it is also powerful. You can easily put it in your bag or pocket and carry it around all day. Compared to other models with the same specifications, SMARTCOBY Pro is the smallest you can buy while maintaining a high output.
 

 

 
Because of its small size, it can be used not only for charging smart devices but also for other wearable applications such as electric heating vests and clothes with built-in fans.
 

 
SMARTCOBY Pro is palm-sized but its capacity is 10000mAh, which lets it charge your smartphone device more than once.
 

 


 
You can check the remaining battery life and know when you need to recharge the SMARTCOBY Pro just by looking at the digital display.
 

 


 
Have you ever needed to use a portable charger, but found the battery was dead?
The SMARTCOBY Pro 30W has a pass-through function that allows you to charge your phone and charger battery at the same time. You do not have to worry about which one you should charge first.
 


 
We used LG's INR 21700 battery cell, the same one used in Tesla vehicles. The high energy density and high compression of the battery cell enabled us to make our charger smaller while keeping its high output.

Last year, together with our 4398 backers, we made a huge success on portable microscopy with our first fingertip microscope. Now we glad to introduce a new model of our fingertip microscope - iMicro C. It has simpler design, larger view field, lower cost and more importantly a longer working distance so it is versatile for observing different objects. It is so tiny that it adds almost nothing on your phone but enables you to carry a microscopic tool with you as easily as you carry your phone. In addition, all the items packed in a thin PP case can be easily fit into wallet.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576382983/xf5hwdhrlapuozwjfz0m.png"" src=""""/></p><p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576383016/zq0iyhyzvuazlt9f4baa.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Highlights</h3><ul>

Since then, we've launched another iMicro C in 2019, with a longer working distance and a broader field of view. We delivered over 14000 Fingertip Microscopes units with these two successful, accomplished campaigns to microscope fans in over 70 countries. It is a breakthrough in portable microscopy - we're quite proud, and thank you all for your support. </p><div data-id=""30031166""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1607964936/gjlftbshrs93uso1s8km.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>We never stop - now we've taken our effort one step further and are pleased to bring you the new, improved version of fingertip microscope - iMicro Q2.</p><h1>What is Fingertip Microscope (iMicro Q2)?</h1><p>Since Antony van Leeuwenhoek invented his microscope in the 17th century, there has been tremendous progress in microscope technology. Microscopes with excellent performance are usually bulky, heavy, and expensive, even for portable ones.

Nowadays, every smartphone comes with a camera as well as a flashlight. The original iMicro Q used a light guide technique to introduce the light to the point of the lens field of view. iMicro Q is a great design but incurs a compatibility problem with some of the phones with a long distance between the camera lens and flash.</p><p>In iMicro Q2, we incorporated a new innovative design: Reflective/Transmission illumination. In this design, the thin PP case is not only used to pack and protect the product but also used as a light-reflective illumination box. The light from the flashlight and ambient light go into the transparent light guide to illuminate the sample. Simultaneously, the light is also reflected from the thin PP case's bottom wall to illuminate the sample. Because of this design, the Reflection/Transmission illumination achieves its high performance with flexibility to work with all the different phone camera lens - flash configurations and therefore being compatible with any smartphone. Even for the phones/pads which do not have a flashlight, it works well with just good ambient light illumination or using close to an ambient light source.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""30776183""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1607964950/gzeusj4ecgmjl3gxaqgs.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><ul><li> <strong><span><span>Seamless coupling with the smartphone: Nano-suction</span></span> <span><span>pad attachment</span></span></strong> </li></ul><p>Compared to conventional adhesive, the nano suction pad mimics gecko's foot-pads: it has thousands of micro air pockets functioning like micro-suction cups to hold the device to the phone. </p><div data-id=""30032016""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1607964951/rubmabovkibkxlt7l4br.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Every on and off application will leave nothing on the phone.

I understand you are waiting for the newest progress on the project. It is also essential for the communication to update you on the status of the project. So we are glad to let you know some progress.1. Production.According to our schedule, we would start shipping in March for Kickstarter backers and April for Indiegogo backers. So we worked hard since the campaign success at Kickstarter and even started early preparation before the campaign ended. We got every step well organized, and finally, at the end of February, we have enough inventory to start shipment in March.2. Shipping progressWe started the shipping process on March 10th, 2021 for Kickstarter backers. It is about 9000 packages to be sent (11000 including the Indiegogo In-demand orders). So it is really a challenging task and needs some time to finish. Here I would like to show you some pictures to let you know the process.We estimated to finish the shipment for most of the Kickstarter backers at the end of March. So we are able to start shipping for Indiegogo backers in April, as scheduled. The history of the projectIn 2018, we took Kickstarter and Indiegogo by storm with the first Fingertip Microscope - iMicro Q, earning 6000 pledges from the community and over 10000 iMicro Q delivered to our backers. Since then, we've launched another iMicro C in 2019, with a longer working distance and a broader field of view. We delivered over 14000 Fingertip Microscopes units with these two successful, accomplished campaigns to microscope fans in over 70 countries. It is a breakthrough in portable microscopy - we're quite proud, and thank you all for your support. We never stop - now we've taken our effort one step further and are pleased to bring you the new, improved version of fingertip microscope - iMicro Q2.What is Fingertip Microscope (iMicro Q2)?Since Antony van Leeuwenhoek invented his microscope in the 17th century, there has been tremendous progress in microscope technology. Microscopes with excellent performance are usually bulky, heavy, and expensive, even for portable ones. With our years of effort, what we introduced in 2018 - the fingertip microscope iMicro Q - is a real breakthrough in mobile microscopy. It has the comparable optical performance to a professional desktop microscope and enables you to carry it with you as easily as you bring your phone. In addition to the iMicro Q's excellent optical performance and portability, iMicro Q2 has a new design to enable it to work with any smartphone.

Very high magnification power: up to 800x
Very low distortion: comparable to a desktop microscope
Very high resolution power: down to 1 micron
Extremely easy to use: ""Stick and Play"" with your phone
Extremely low profile and weight: ½ inch and ~1/60 oz
Extremely easy to carry: fit in wallet like a card
Extremely low cost: ~1% of the price of a desktop microscope
Compatible with any smartphone  
Here are some micrographs took with iMicro Q2 (using an iPhone 11):Key features of iMicro Q2Extremely high magnification: up to 800xIt has the same high magnification as iMicro Q. When used with a smartphone, it can observe, for example, at full view the mouth part of the housefly at a magnification of ~100x, and then zoom in detail up to 800x magnification. It is able clearly to see the spiral structure of the tip of the mouthpart at high magnification. If you don't have a microscope, you never know a housefly has such a fine structure at its mouth part. It is amazing!
 Very high resolutionThe clear observation of the spiral structure of the mouth part of the housefly is already proof of its high resolution. We did some further tests: the USAF 1951 resolution test chart was used to test the resolution of iMicro Q2 on an iPhone 11. The intervals between the finest test bars are 2.19 micrometers. The finest test bars on the 7th group are clearly seen, indicating its resolution is far beyond that.
 Very low distortionA grid calibration target was used to test the distortion. Even in full view at the edge of the visual field, no noticeable distortion was observed.Based on this optical performance test, iMicro Q2 has excellent optical performance, definitely comparable to a desktop compound microscope.A stem of xylophytadicotylendon T.S. was observed under iMicro Q2 as well as a desktop microscope Motic DMB-1223 (price ~2200USD for microscope + 500USD for camera attachment). No noticeable difference was observed, as shown in a side-by-side comparison.
 Extremely low profileIt is about the size of a fingertip and weighs only 0.5g (~1/60 oz). It is very thin, only 3.2mm (1/8 inch). No parts extrude beyond the edge of your phone when it is installed. Also, We considered the portability of the package from the beginning of the design. It is packed in a card size thin PP case which is easy to fit into your wallet!
 Extremely easy to useThe Fingertip microscope is different from a comprehensive desktop microscope - it does not introduce a bulky and expensive focus tuning system. In contrast, the iMicro Q2 has no knobs and buttons at all. Compared with the original iMicro Q, the new iMicro Q2 is more comfortable to align and attach to your phone's camera.

 Works with any smartphoneWhen we launched iMicro Q, we were often asked: does this work with my phone? There is no more confusion with iMicro Q2: We design it to work with any phone with a camera. iMicro Q2 will be coupled to your smartphone by an innovative, re-useable, nano-suction pad. Whether your phone has a single back camera or multiple back cameras, a flat camera(s), or extruded camera(s), the iMicro Q2 will work with them all. Please see the picture for your reference to see how it looks with different camera configurations.Principle and development processHow it worksThe magnification mainly relies on its complex optical system for traditional compound microscopes, including objective and eyepiece. Its total magnification is a combination of the magnification of objective and eyepiece.For our fingertip microscope, three stages of magnification are combined to achieve the total magnification. First, the lens provides optical magnification to generate the image on the smartphone camera's sensor; second, the image on the sensor is displayed on the much larger screen via the electronic process and magnification; third, digital zoom provides further magnification as a digital magnification to the image. The total magnification is a combination of these three. Therefore, iMicro Q2 uses a different process and technology compared to a traditional microscope. Thanks to the advance of micro-optics and smartphone technology, and with the effort and expertise accumulated in the past years, we have enabled iMicro Q2 to achieve excellent performance at a low cost.Development path and processWe walked a long way to develop these smartphone-based microscopic tools since registering the first patent in 2012. We have already successfully built a series of smartphone microscope products, including iMICROSCOPE, iMICROSCOPE R, and the μRuler, iMicro Q, iMicro C as well as this new version iMicro Q2.We have shaped and polished our Fingertip Microscope idea according to previous backers' and customers' suggestions and comments based on our previous successful projects. We have optimized the optics and the overall design, and each step was tested and refined using prototypes to achieve the best performance possible.The essential techniques to achieve its high performanceDedicated optics: multi-element aspherical micro-lensThe lens is a crucial component of the system. A small ball lens (van Leeuwenhoek) is a straightforward approach. But it is well known to suffer from a very limited usable field of view due to severe field curvature effects, spherical and other aberrations. The iMicro Q2 uses a more complex multi-aspherical lens with a dedicated design to achieve both the high performance of magnification and low aberration.
  Innovative illumination: Reflection/transmission light design Light and illumination are essential to microscopy. Nowadays, every smartphone comes with a camera as well as a flashlight. The original iMicro Q used a light guide technique to introduce the light to the point of the lens field of view. iMicro Q is a great design but incurs a compatibility problem with some of the phones with a long distance between the camera lens and flash.In iMicro Q2, we incorporated a new innovative design: Reflective/Transmission illumination. In this design, the thin PP case is not only used to pack and protect the product but also used as a light-reflective illumination box. The light from the flashlight and ambient light go into the transparent light guide to illuminate the sample. Simultaneously, the light is also reflected from the thin PP case's bottom wall to illuminate the sample. Because of this design, the Reflection/Transmission illumination achieves its high performance with flexibility to work with all the different phone camera lens - flash configurations and therefore being compatible with any smartphone. Even for the phones/pads which do not have a flashlight, it works well with just good ambient light illumination or using close to an ambient light source.   Seamless coupling with the smartphone: Nano-suction pad attachment Compared to conventional adhesive, the nano suction pad mimics gecko's foot-pads: it has thousands of micro air pockets functioning like micro-suction cups to hold the device to the phone. Every on and off application will leave nothing on the phone. This newly developed ""nano suction pad"" is residue-free, non-tacky, and repeatable. The use of a nano-suction pad has been proved in our previous product, and it is repeatable and easily cleaned by a PSA tape (such as Scotch tape).

 
Precise focus control: automatic + manual focusEvery smartphone now has an auto-focus function. When iMicro Q2 is coupled with your smartphone, this automatic focus function also works. We have precisely designed and machined iMicro Q2 to control the focus point accurately. As long as you point it closely towards a sample plane, the sample falls into the autofocus range, and it will automatically focus for a clear image.μRuler and Dedicated App: for professional needsA high-quality μRuler (stage micrometer) will be provided (as an option) with iMicro Q2 to calibrate the scale-bar in our App, i-Seeing, and enable you to measure size accurately. Please see our previous campaign, μRuler- A micro-ruler to measure micro-objects, for more information.iMicro Q2 actually works with any camera App which can control the flashlight when shooting. In some cases, it is crucial to have a scale-bar and ensure its accuracy on the micrograph. The dedicated App, i-Seeing, was designed to take micrographs to meet professional demand. The scale-bar on the micrograph can be toggled on/off to enable you to embed a scale-bar on the image if required.How to use it?The iMicro Q2 is very easy to align and attach to the phone's camera. Just connect and point closely towards what you want to see, and it works!

 
Critical improvements compared with iMicro Q
The iMicro Q2 is very easy to align and attach to the phone's camera. Just connect and point closely towards what you want to see, and it works!

 Better optical performance - Although the lens optical technology is the same as with iMicro Q, we optimized the design of Q2 regarding structure and production stability. These improvements ensure the best performance and excellence in lens optics.
 Smaller and lighter - it is smaller and lighter and, more importantly, it has a round shape with optimized size, which enables it to stay firmly and stably attached to the camera lens.
 Easier to use - Thanks to its thin and round shape, it is easier to align with and attach to the camera lens.
 Works with any camera phone - The essential improvement is that it should work with any camera phone with dramatic evolution in compatibility with this new design.
Comparison between iMicro Q2 and iMicro CThe picture shows the comparison of the same scale target being observed with iMicro C and iMicro Q2 (when no digital zoom is applied), so you can compare their visual field. You will see they are complementary: iMicro C has a lower magnification and a larger visual field, while iMicro Q2 has a higher magnification and a high resolution. The detailed comparison between iMicro Q2 and iMicro C is shown in the table. They are both suitable for different yet complementary purposes.  What people say about Fingertip MicroscopeFeatured on mediaApplication examplesIt is super portable, and you don't need complicated settings, so you can immediately take images, use it for reporting, and transfer images to your colleagues. Plus, you can use it with any smartphone. It can be used in many professions where you need accurate changes and immediate research in the field. For example, it can monitor a knife's sharpening process, check the masks' quality, and measure small machinery parts' quality. It can also check the mounting of samples on a TEM grid, check the quality and texture of cloth, identify the counterfeit, evaluate the printing quality, and check the flaws in jewelry and many other applications. It is not just a tool and can also be used for a lot of fun: parents might use it during play to explore the wonderful micro-world with their child.Many of our previous backers shared their beautiful and amazing pictures when they used the fingertip microscopes. Here are a few examples of previous backers' photos with the iMicro Q and iMicro C on their phones. HighlightsRewardsTimeline",28.0,2,"6 Campaigns

Ever worked in a cafe where the tables closest to power points are already taken? We hear ya. Forgotten to charge your phone overnight but you're already late to work? Happened to us more times than we can count. Got a hot date but your phone dies and you're lost without Google Maps? Great first impression!  We've thought about every situation where you haven't been able to charge your device just when you need it the most.Chargeasap's solution? The ultimate powerbank that's portable, fast and built to last to ensure ALL your gadgets can truly keep up with your life.   After raising over $1,668,532+ from 10,000+ backers and shipping out more than 11,000+ Flash power banks, we set out determined to see how we could make Flash even better. After reading the feedback we received from thousands of backers, we’ve added a whole list of extra powerful and upgraded features to reengineer the ultimate portable mobile charger to truly complement your work and lifestyle needs. Introducing Flash Pro Plus & Flash Pro. Apple users will be able to charge their Macbook Pro 16"" at max speed as well as their iPhone 12 with the built in magnetic wireless charger that's compatible with Magsafe. There's now a separate wireless charger for your Apple watch and we've doubled the charging speed from 2.5W to 5W. Upgrade to Flash Pro Plus for only $10 during the Backerkit survey stage. Android users will be able to charge their laptops at max speed with the 100W output as well as their mobile device with the wireless charger which has been upgraded from 10W to 15W.Flash Pro Plus has not just 2 but 3 x USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 ports as well as 1 x USB-A port, magnetic wireless charger and even a separate wireless charging pad for your Apple Watch allowing you to charge up to 6 devices at once. Flash Pro (designed for Android uers can charge up to 5 devices at once). Flash Pro Plus can deliver a powerful 100W Power Delivery 3.0 from a single USB-C port  while many of the competition struggle to even reach 60W. Additional USB-C ports are able to reach 60W and 20W respectively. We've also thrown in a powerful 50W USB-A that's been specially designed to be compatible with Oppo (50W), OnePlus (50W),Vivo (50W) and Huawei (22.5W) proprietary fast charge technology as well as supporting Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0. To top this all off Flash Pro Plus features a fast 15W magnetic wireless charging pad compatible with Magsafe devices and a separate wireless pad to support 5W Apple Watch.Meaning this 1 power bank can quick charge a large laptop (e.g. 15""/16"" MacBook Pro or Dell XPS 13/15), a flagship phone (iPhone 12 Pro), a tablet (iPad), a flagship phone (Samsung S21+), another flagship phone (Huawei P30 Pro) and your Apple Watch all at the same time! But that's not all, Flash works with any modern USB device and can...Also charge Cameras, GoPros, Speakers, Headphones, Nintendo Switches, Microphones and even Drones, you name it.Flash Pro Plus: Fully functional and ready to go Flash Pro: Fully functional and ready to goWe have already produced 100 final working samples that are currently being distributed to major media publications, influencers and our beta testers for hands-on testing. We can't wait to share some reviews with you very soon! Aside from completing the final mold for Flash Pro and Flash Pro Plus, we have also pre-purchased raw material so we won't be affected by any shortages other companies are facing to ensure we can head straight into production as soon as the live campaign concludes.When Chargeasap comes up with the idea and design for each new product, a significant amount of time is spent researching which is the best factory to work with to execute it. This is our 10th crowdfunding project and we've partnered up with a larger and more experienced power bank factory. We've got plenty of experience under our belts on how to manufacture high-quality mobile phone accessories and fulfil 130,000+ orders. After being blindsided more than once by completely unexpected issues with manufacturing and shipping, especially with the uncertainties caused by COVID, each campaign we run has taught us how to be better prepared in order to mitigate risks.We're looking forward to another kickass campaign that will bring you all smiles :)Press FeaturesNotebook Check: ""Having used the Flash Pro for some time now, I am mostly of the opinion that this latest power bank from its Australian start-up is worth having around.""Android Central: ""The engineering and thermal management are impressive, and I'm happy to see boundaries being pushed...""Phandroid: ""I have thrown all of my other portable chargers in a drawer. This is now the only one that I carry with me whenever I leave the house..""ZDNET: ""It can deliver plenty of power to multiple devices, and you'll always know just how much power you've got.""Android Guys: ""That’s why we love the Chargeasap Flash Pro so much; it lets us power all of our daily gadgets.""iPhone Hacks: ""Quickly charge the power bank when you stop for lunch or dinner and then use it to charge all your other devices."" So how does Flash Pro Plus blow the competition out of the water? Check this out, Flash Pro Plus has...Larger battery capacity and power output, OLED display showing realtime battery percentage left along with Magsafe compatibility. Almost all USB-C battery packs in the market are underpowered with tiny battery capacity or low USB-C power (up to 60W). Flash Pro Plus packs up to 100W USB-C Power Delivery in a single port (up to 190W combined power in all ports) and has the maximum 25000mAh battery capacity allowed on airplanes, yet it is still portable and pocket-sized. Better Features, Better Specifications and Better Value For Money Don't you just hate it when your powerbank indicator is just a few small LED lights that keep changing each time you check it? After reading the feedback we received from thousands of Flash backers, we discovered that the main request from backers was a screen that would allow them to accurately determine how much battery was left remaining in their powerbank. We went straight back to the drawing board to see how we could incorporate this suggestion to improve the Flash experience. We’re super excited to share Flash Pro Plus has an 1.3"" OLED display giving you real time information about not only just the battery percentage remaining, but the power output from each port measured in Watts and Amps when charging a device as well as the running temperature. We've increased the battery capacity of Flash Pro Plus by 25% from 20000mAh to 25000mAh whilst only increasing the size by 5%. The additional battery capacity gives you that extra juice you've been asking for but in a compact size that's still super convenient to carry around with you everywhere. With the release of iPhone 12, this is a must have feature for those who prefer wireless charging versus wired charging. A recent poll with our previous Flash backers showed 47% wanted to see the addition of this feature. Flash Pro Plus is capable of 15W magnetic wireless charging for Magsafe compatible devices and 20W charging when connected to a device via a cable. Just place your iPhone 12 on top of the wireless charging pad and it will magnetically attach to help your device remain in place. The magnetic wireless charger is also able to support up to 10W wireless charging for all other devices e.g. Airpods ProFlash Pro Plus has 3 x USB-C ports to support high powered charging to a range of devices at the same time. A single USB-C port is able to support 100W Power Delivery 3.0 while the additional USB-C ports are able to reach 60W and 20W respectively. Each USB-C port also supports the maximum charging speed of 20W for the iPhone 12 range. This allows you to charge a large laptop (e.g. 15""/16"" MacBook Pro or Dell XPS 13/15), a second laptop (Macbook 13"") and a flagship phone (iPhone 12 Pro) all at the same time at maximum speed. Configure your set-up with endless possibilities. Flash Pro has a specially designed USB-A port with Android users in mind with an increased power output ofrom 22.5W by 50% to 50W to support the latest proprietary fast charging technology including Oneplus (50W), OPPO SVOOC (50W), as well as Huawei Super Charge (22.5W).  Users of these brands know the frustrations they must go through as normally you only experience these proprietary fast charge speeds when you purchase the original brand's charger or power bank.Wireless charging has been upgraded from 10W to 15W for our Flash Pro to support wireless charging for all wireless devices including phones and Apple Airpods. Wireless charging works through electromagnetic induction with a sender coil in the powerbank and a receiver coil built into the back of the phone. The wireless charging pad will be able to support 10W charging for iPhone 12 devices (Flash Pro Plus version supports 15W fast charge and can be upgraded for only $10).  Each wireless charging pad also has foreign object detection (FOD) to ensure safety. This feature allows Flash Pro to detect if a foreign object, such as metal, is nearby or on its surface and stop charging. Without FOD, the charger will continue to heat up causing the object placed on or near the wireless charger to become very hot, which could lead to serious injuries.Please note: It is not recommended to use the wireless charger when the power bank is at less than 2% and this is a standard with all wireless chargers. It is not compatible with Samsung Galaxy Watches as Samsung has chosen to use a charging coil that's different to Qi compatible devices.  For Samsung S21 Ultra, Flash Pro can support up to 10W as the Samsung 15W wireless charging protocol has not been fully decrypted yet. The wireless charger on Flash Pro is also not compatible with Apple Watches as it doesn't have a dual coil wireless charger. (Flash Pro Plus supports Apple Watch wireless charging and can be upgraded for only $10). For our Apple Watch fans, Flash Pro Plus now has a separate charging pad to charge your Apple watch. We've also doubled the charging speed from 2.5W to 5W so your watch will always be ready to go when you are. As an Apple user myself, I know first-hand the frustration of having to always carry the wireless pad around since its so hard to find wireless pads and powerbanks that work with the Apple watch and if they do, they are usually very expensive.  The charging pad has a magnet to ensure your watch magnetically stays in place. Please note the Apple Watch charging pad is not compatible with Samsung Galaxy Watches as Samsung has chosen to use a charging coil that's different to Apple Watches.Our power banks have been built with a temperature thermistor which helps to control and monitor the temperature of the power bank when it is in use to ensure it operates within a safe operating temperature.  This reduces the chance of abnormal heating while it is charging, improves the battery life of the power bank, protects your devices and internal circuitry and also ensures user safety. If the temperature exceeds the temperature set by our program, in order to protect the circuit and devices, Flash Pro Plus will go into power reduction and automatic shutdown processing.For example,  if the temperature reaches 55℃, C1 will reduce to 60W output and shut down automatically if it reaches60℃.Flash Pro Plus is now able to detect and charge low voltage devices such as headphones and vapes from each port, allowing you to charge an even greater range of devices. Charge Flash Pro Plus and all your devices at the same time!To save your even more time, Flash Pro Plus supports pass through charging so you can charge your devices and Flash Pro Plus at the same time through a single power outlet. Running low on battery? You can charge up to 5 devices while charging up Flash Pro at the same time meaning your 5 devices can be charged over and over. Recharge Flash to 80% in 45 minutes, or empty to 100% (full charge) in only 1 hr 10 min.A huge battery capacity means nothing if it takes forever to charge. You don't want your backup battery to spend more time recharging itself than charging your devices. With its 100W USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 input and Panasonic™ graphene composite batteries, it will take only 1 hr 10min for a full charge of 25000 mAh. This means you'll have a powerbank that's already ready to go before you are.Please note: With different brands of 100W adapters, different 5A USB-C cables, and different test environments (such as hot and cold locations), the test results may be a little bit different.Rule the skies with a maximum battery capacity approved by all major and minor airlines internationally. Maximum airline safe battery capacity for TSA/EASA is 27000mAh / 100Wh.  7 x the battery life if your iPhone 12 or 1.3x the battery life of 13"" MacBook Pro with Flash Pro Plus's huge 25000 mAh capacity. Slim enough to fit in pockets and easily grab with one hand.Despite all the extra juice, Flash Pro Plus and Flash Pro comes in a pocket-sized 595g (1.3lb) and 577g (1.27lb) respectively. Conveniently carry the only battery that matters, that can power all your devices, wherever you go, without fear of ever losing power ensuring your life stays uninterrupted while you're always on the go. Why our customers love our Flash Powerbank!  The magic to Flash Pro Plus's incredible specs is through incorporating the same batteries that were used in Flash. Instead of 4, there are 5 x 21700 Panasonic™ Lithium Polymer Graphene Composite Battery Cells for the larger battery capacity. Other brands use Lithium Ion batteries which has lower energy density, is 20 - 30% cheaper to make and has a larger form factor.These batteries have been specially designed a pioneer in the electric vehicle space in partnership with Pansonic who is the manufacturer. Only launched in March 2019 and still not widely available publicly, this unique battery is presently the highest energy density battery in the world, 20% more than its predecessor. We've chosen Graphene as it's the world's most conductive material with ultra-high thermal conductivity and Graphite films are widely used in thermal applications for mobile phones and other high-power devices. These Panasonic li-po graphene composite batteries comprise of more than 15% graphene and graphite which is the ideal amount to have in a battery. Any less and the electricity conductivity will be reduced and any more the battery will be unable to function. This is a proprietary industry trade secret of the battery designer and manufacturer.Aside from upgrading the tech in Flash Pro Plus, we've also improved the design by making changes based on feedback we've received so we can enhance the user's experience.
We've improved the finishing by smoothing out the edges and rounding the corners
The power button has been re-designed so that it's more flush, easier to press and feels sturdier
We've removed the glass wireless charging pad to increase the durability of Flash Pro Plus and to make it drop proof to take on all the bangs and drops you might experience in your day.
Flash 2.0 versus Flash Pro PlusWe wanted to make the most powerful USB-C battery pack so we put in not only 3 x USB-C port but we also added 1 x USB-A port and 2 wireless pads giving Flash Pro Plus a total power output of 190W so that it will be compatible with all your modern USB devices. Early product design sketches. Experimented with different shapes to determine the best fit for the extra battery.Final prototype of Flash ProDimensions of Flash Pro PlusDimensions of Flash ProOne of the most useful features of the graphene composite features is a battery that lasts longer than traditional batteries. Each Flash Pro powerbank is rated to last 2,000 life cycles vs only 500 cycles of the closest competitors. This means Each Flash Pro has a 5 years+ battery life, which means you can use Each Flash Pro every single day for 5 years and it would still seem like its brand new. WOW!Through laboratory testing equipment, we've tested the battery to last 1,836 cycles and still have a capacity above 87% (a life cycle is considered above 80%), so in reality the life cycle is far greater than 2,000 but we are being conservative in our statement of 2,000.We've also improved the discharge rate from 350 days to 395 days. Discharge rate refers to the amount of battery that is lost each day when the powerbank is is not in use. This means Flash Pro Plus's battery will last more than year even if it's not used. Neat right?While designing a high capacity battery, we still wanted a highly compact and portable solution. We've chosen Aircraft grade anodised aluminium as the shell enclosure material due to being strong yet thin and malleable enough to follow the lines of the battery cells, wrapping and protecting it with minimal space wastage. Aluminium is also a very good at heat dissipation to keep the battery cool at all times. The minimalist aluminium design is efficient, functional and matches the MacBook perfectly. Overall the entire aluminium body now has a smoother finish with edges and rounded corners for a more premium feel. What's convenient is you can charge Flash Pro Plus with your existing Macbook 15"" or 16"" Pro wall charger at 100% max speed. Flash Pro Plus is also compatible with all other standard USB-C chargers already used by your devices including Macbook 12 or 13"", USB-C, Dell XPS 13/15 and more.For those who don't carry any of these devices, we also offer a range of wall chargers capable of outputting the 100W needed to charge Flash Pro Plus at full speed. Not only fast and powerful, the Graphene battery technology also makes Flash Pro Plus the world’s safest power bank by allowing it to fast charge at low temperatures compared to standard batteries. Flash Pro Plus will never go above 60°C (140°F) unlike competitor power banks which can reach 70°C (167°F) ensuring it is safer and also longer lasting.  You'll feel very comfortable knowing that this baby won't heat up or bulge over time like you see in many of your older USB devices. Graphene composite batteries have much smaller internal resistance and better conductivity than traditional li-po batteries. Graphene composite is also added to both the positive and negative poles of the battery cell to further increase the conductivity. Due to the unique thermal dissipation properties of Graphene, no further cooling mechanisms such as heat sinks are required allowing us to keep Flash Pro Plus as thin and light as possible.Our thermal imaging camera showing Flash Pro Plus is still cooler than a smaller competitor A company's battery chemical structure is a trade secret which isn't shared publicly or to most of a company's staff. One major reason is other companies will copy their technology which is why many leading brands only put li-po only on their battery. This stands for ""lithium polymer"" which means it’s a lithium-ion (li-ion) battery with additives of other special materials one of which in this case is Graphene which is able to significantly alter the batteries properties enough to differentiate it. This is the battery chemical composition report for the Panasonic 21700 batteries found inside Flash Pro Plus:At the request of the battery companies we have withheld full details of 3 of the ingredients. Though with some research you can easily discover 1 of the compounds found in all electric vehicle batteries is Cobalt. Unsurprisingly there are over a dozen ingredients that make up this complicated graphene battery which is the result of a decades of battery technology research and testing- hence why battery companies like to keep this mixture a company trade secret. In order to achieve international certification for safe use, all our powerbanks are put through a number of rigorous industrial tests to ensure Flash Pro Plus can withstand daily use- even in the most extreme of circumstances.TEMPERATURE TEST Each powerbank is placed into a temperature chamber and exposed to extreme temperatures of -10°C to 65°C. In the event Flash Pro Plus is exposed to these temperatures, once its been moved to the safe operating temperature it will work perfectly fine.Device Operating Temperature: -10ºC (14°F) to 60ºC (140°F)CHARGE/DISCHARGE TEST Each powerbank is charged and discharged from 0 - 100% 4 times to pass quality control. Each powerbank will be charged to 100% when shipped so you'll receive a product that's ready out of the box.DROP TEST The powerbank is dropped from each of the 6 sides at a height of 1.2m (3.9ft) onto a 10cm (3.9"")  wooden plate. This test is important to ensure Flash Pro Plus can handle all the accidental drops that you will experience in your daily life.SHAKING TEST Each unit is put through a shaking test machine which shakes as a frequency range of 5Hz to 500Hz and tested on each of the X, Y and Z axis for 1 hour.HUMIDITY TESTEach powerbank is subjected to a high humidity environment of 60% - 90% and tested to ensure it still works under these conditions.STATIC TEST During this test the powerbank has a contact discharge voltage of 2000V and gap discharging voltage of 2000V. We're setting a new standard with a 2 year international warranty, doubling the current standard of 1 year. This is only possible for Flash Pro Plus due to the use of graphene batteries which have a battery life greater than 5 years, compared to other batteries which are only protected by a 1 year warranty.Upgrade to Flash Pro Plus for only $10 during the Backerkit survey stage.Flash Pro (Android users) will be available in only Black while Flash Pro Plus (Apple users) will be available in Space Grey.  As an early supporter, you also unlock access to a range of Chargeasap's innovative products at a huge discount such as the Infinity cables and our fast car chargers. You can add these products to your order after the campaign finishes. You'll be emailed a survey from BackerKit, where you can choose your colour choices, change your shipping address and purchase add-ons.Please note to support the high 100W charge speeds, your USB-C cable must have an E-Mark chip to prevent the cable from overheating and regulating the Volts and Amps correctly. All our Infinity cables are able to support up to 100W to charge Flash Pro Plus at it's max speed and come with an E-mark chip which means by pairing the Flash Pro Plus and Infinity cable together, you will have 1 cable and powerbank that can charge all modern USB devices. No more having to carry around multiple chargers or cables around, neat isn't it? All rewards will be delivered via air freight directly from our distribution centre in Shenzhen, China. Backers are also expected to receive rewards between 4-21 days from shipping depending on the size of the delivery and your country (including USA). Shipping powerbanks by air is very costly and subject to many restrictions due to it containing a large internal battery. Despite this, we've still chosen this method so no matter what country you're supporting from you don't have the long transportation times of sea freight.With the recent introduction of import VAT on all goods into the EU, our backers located in the EU will need to be charged an extra $9 to cover VAT. This will be charged during the Backerkit survey stage at the end of the live campaign. Although the cost is more than $9, we will be absorbing the majority of the tax in order to keep the shipping fee as low as possible.   Shipping will be available to most of the major countries: US, Australia, UK, HK, Canada, Singapore, Korea, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland, Japan plus many more. Due to the restrictions placed on air deliveries containing lithium batteries, we are currently unable to ship to Hawaii, Alaska, India, South America, South Africa, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and other remote or island countries. This list is constantly changing so feel free to reach out to us to confirm if shipping is available to your country.  Flash Pro Plus (Designed for Apple Users)

E-mail: kendyz.gpd.hk  In 2016, our definition of UMPC was: the screen cannot be larger than 7 inches, and if it is larger than 7 inches, you will not be able to carry it in your pocket, and thus UMPC is best realized in Pocket 2!  For Ultrabook, our definition is: the screen can’t be smaller than 8.9 inches and no larger than 10 inches, and the weight should be limited to 700g. The best user experiences of the GPD P2 Max are: an unrestraint feeling when tapping the keyboard with both hands, being able to carry it and hold it in one hand, and having it fit easily in a mini backpack. It can only be called Ultrabook when these design standards can be met. Of course, the keyboard should adopt the standard ""QWERTY"" layout, instead of a variety of perverted, anti-human designs. It should have four advantages of being light, thin, fast and small. Too small is not suitable for two-handed input, and if too large, it is reduced to a cumbersome laptop. a screen of 8.9-10-inches and weighing less than 700g are the limits for Ultrabook We think there is no Ultrabook on the market that meets this standard. From the moment Intel defined Ultrabook, ASUS, Toshiba, Lenovo, Acer, HP, Dell, Samsung, LG, ThinkPad all have launched the so-called Ultrabook, but none of them are really Ultrabook. If just considering the weight and volume of the plate, even 2in1, which features the concept of ""both tablet and PC"", doesn’t have any advantages compared to the criteria we defined. After all, the tablet of Surface Pro 6 already weighs 770g alone, and the overall weight is more than 1,000g if the weight of the keyboard cover is added.We have launched P2 Max for the purpose of proving that the weight of Ultrabook can be controlled below 700g and 8.9 inches is enough!

GPD is our brand, and its full name is GamePad Digital, which came from the company's founder's idea of making the first game product. Service tenet of GPD brand is: based on the needs of market segment and orienting niche players, it provides personalized intelligent games and their peripheral products and services.  The reason why we launch the crowdfunding on Indiegogo is that the research and development cost of P2 Max, the purchase cost of molds and materials are extremely high. All the money we raise will be used for mass production of this product. We believe that this product will bring a new experience to high-end business and mobile office, and it will redefine Ultrabook. Hopefully, you can support this project!  1. Does the fund raised this time include the tariffs imposed upon arrival in the destination country?The fund raised includes the international express freight and surcharge for remote areas, but does not include the tariff generated when entering the destination country, which you need to pay by yourself. There is a tariff of around 21% imposed upon arrival in EU countries; There is a tariff of about 10% imposed upon arrival in Japan. Goods over $800 are subject to tariff upon arrival in the United States. Tariff in some other countries may be even higher. 2. What after-sales services will the users who participate in the crowdfunding can enjoy?Crowdfunding users enjoy the same warranty rights as those who purchase the products after they are officially launched. If you are not satisfied with the product, you can return it within one week after receipt of the product, but the freight incurred when the product is mailed to you will be deducted from the refunded fee.Please note that the postage and packing charges for return will be borne by you. When you mail it, you must mail it via your local courier. For other international logistics, tariffs equal to 20%~30% of the value of goods when entering China will be generated, which GPD will not bear. 3. What if the target amount is not met after the crowdfunding?If the target amount can’t be reached after the crowdfunding, we will also issue returns. Meanwhile, we will seek other financing channels to ensure the smooth development and mass production. I hope that players who love this handheld game console can keep an eye on the latest progress of the project. 4.
