<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m Dr. Daniel Howard, CEO of Quantum Energy Consultants (<a href=""https://quantum-ec.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.quantum-ec.com</a>).  We’re launching this campaign to make it undeniably clear how a clean energy and climate plan for America is far, far better for the economy, environment and quality of life.  </p>
<p>While President Trump is promising better economic growth with his fossil fuel energy plan, this project will uncover the trillions of dollars of hidden environmental and health costs in Trump's plan, showing how they will be devastating to the planet and the economy.  At the same time, Biden’s Clean Energy and Climate Plan is being proposed as a net cost to taxpayers, yet there are trillions of dollars of hidden benefits in Biden's plan that this project will reveal, showing how it is a triple win for the environment, economy and quality of life.</p>
<p>Our proprietary <a href=""https://quantum-ec.com/totalview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Total Cost Energy Model</a> is the first energy model to assess a full spectrum of economic, environmental and health costs and benefits and express them in dollar amounts, making it easy for everyone to understand.</p>
<p>The first $25k of funding will go towards completing the project and broadcasting results before the election.  Every dollar contributed beyond that will go directly towards getting voters this key missing information before they hit the polls and implementing a clean energy and climate plan for America.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your backing, we will apply our <a href=""https://quantum-ec.com/totalview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Total Cost Energy Model</a> to uncover the trillions of dollars of hidden costs in Trump’s dirty fossil fuel energy plan as well as the trillions of dollars of hidden benefits in Biden’s clean energy plan.  </p>
<p>How it works:</p>
<p>Step 1.  We input Trump's energy plan and Biden's energy plan into our Total Cost Energy Model</p>
<p>Step 2.  We purchase the necessary input data to calculate the economic, environmental and health impacts</p>
<p>Step 3.  We run our Total Cost Energy Model for Trump's plan and Biden's plan</p>
<p>Step 4.  The Total Cost Energy Model outputs a full picture of the economic, environmental and health costs and benefits for both Trump's plan and Biden's plan</p>
<p>Step 5.  We broadcast the results widely so voters have the facts before they go to the polls</p>
<p>We’ve set everything up for the project.  Your support will enable us to purchase the data, complete the project and publicize the results before the election.  </p>

Most people immediately think of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and starved seabirds with stomachs full of plastic particles. However, one aspect is almost completely ignored: a significant amount of microplastics in our streams, rivers, lakes, and seas is released into the environment through our wastewater.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/X8pgp15.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/X8pgp15.jpg"" src="""" title=""mp_en""/></a></p><p> </p><p>The danger is that microplastics are barely visible to the naked eye and thus represent an invisible threat. Due to their chemical properties, they can collect pollutants and toxins, hormones, drug residues, and also cancer-causing substances from the wastewater on their surface, from which they can also release these substances to humans, animals, and plants.</p><p>Much of the microplastics come from our daily lives. Sources are synthetic textiles which release up to 2000 fibers per washing cycle, tire abrasion which gets washed into the sewer by the rain, and scrub and abrasive particles which are added to cosmetics and cleaners.</p><p>Wastewater treatment plants are unable to filter microplastic particles from our wastewater. As a result, the particles, together with the adhering toxins and pollutants, reach our environment, our food chain, and the human body.</p><p><strong>The ECOFARIO technology will change that!</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/aFVT3Fs.gif"" src="""" title=""ecofario_start_en""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>The Problem:</h3><p>The fundamental problem with microplastics is its size. The particles are so small (down to the nanometer scale) that they are almost invisible to the naked eye. As a result, they are distributed everywhere around the globe. Scientists have found microplastic particles even in the most remote regions of the earth, e.g. in the Antarctic and in mountain lakes of Mongolia.</p><p>Another problem resulting from the chemical nature of microplastic particles is that they can adsorb on their surface countless toxins and pollutants, e.g. drug residues, hormones or cancer-causing substances.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/2QFgdoW.gif"" src="""" title=""ecofario_mp_en""/> </p><p> </p><p>These pollutants then pass through the food chain, first of all into our flora and fauna and then into the human body. In marine wildlife, microplastics can be found in mussels, fish and even in freshwater plankton, one of the major food sources of many freshwater fish. Even in our food, microplastics can be found everywhere. Examples are beer, honey, and bottled water. Thus, it is not surprising that scientists can even detect microplastics in the human body.</p><p><strong>This message is alarming!</strong></p><p>The biggest problem with this is that the wastewater treatment processes are currently not designed to filter out such small particles. Thus, these particles, together with the adhering toxins and pollutants, can enter the environment almost unhindered. Although established technologies such as micro-, ultra- or nanofiltration could filter extremely small particles out of water, these technologies are less suitable for the use in wastewater treatment plants due to the use of a filter medium, resulting in limited flow rates and very high energy consumption.</p><h3> </h3><h3>The Solution:</h3><p>Of course, the ultimate solution to this problem would be the complete abandonment of plastic of any kind. Since this solution is utopian, unfortunately, we must prevent the microplastic particles from entering our water cycle.</p><p><strong>This is where the ECOFARIO technology comes into play:</strong></p><p>After entering our High-G Separators, the polluted water is forced into heavy rotation (up to 2000 G). Due to these extremely high G-forces, we are able to separate the microplastic particles from the wastewater. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/RuJyXdh.gif"" src="""" title=""ecofario_high_g_separator_en""/> </p><p> </p><p>Our patented ECOFARIO technology is based on the hydrocyclone principle and has been modified by us in such a way that it can even separate particles like microplastics, which differ only minimally from water in terms of their density. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/ZgdM7v9.gif"" src="""" title=""ecofario_flow_simulation_en""/> </p><p> </p><p>The microplastic particles filtered out of the wastewater, together with the adhering toxins and pollutants, are then put into thermal recycling. This is the only way that the particles, and above all the toxins and pollutants, can never get into the environment again.</p><p>The underlying ECOFARIO effect will also allow us to use our technology in many more fields of application. These are for example separating oil from water after oil disasters or filtering powder coat particles from industrial paint shop wash waters.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Who We Are:</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550076300/jj4y1czah30p5uiogufb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>We are a team of four entrepreneurs and friends from the Munich area in Bavaria, Southern Germany.

Due to their chemical properties, they can collect pollutants and toxins, hormones, drug residues, and also cancer-causing substances from the wastewater on their surface, from which they can also release these substances to humans, animals, and plants.Much of the microplastics come from our daily lives. Sources are synthetic textiles which release up to 2000 fibers per washing cycle, tire abrasion which gets washed into the sewer by the rain, and scrub and abrasive particles which are added to cosmetics and cleaners.Wastewater treatment plants are unable to filter microplastic particles from our wastewater. As a result, the particles, together with the adhering toxins and pollutants, reach our environment, our food chain, and the human body.The ECOFARIO technology will change that!   The Problem:The fundamental problem with microplastics is its size. The particles are so small (down to the nanometer scale) that they are almost invisible to the naked eye. As a result, they are distributed everywhere around the globe. Scientists have found microplastic particles even in the most remote regions of the earth, e.g. in the Antarctic and in mountain lakes of Mongolia.Another problem resulting from the chemical nature of microplastic particles is that they can adsorb on their surface countless toxins and pollutants, e.g. drug residues, hormones or cancer-causing substances.   These pollutants then pass through the food chain, first of all into our flora and fauna and then into the human body. In marine wildlife, microplastics can be found in mussels, fish and even in freshwater plankton, one of the major food sources of many freshwater fish. Even in our food, microplastics can be found everywhere. Examples are beer, honey, and bottled water. Thus, it is not surprising that scientists can even detect microplastics in the human body.This message is alarming!The biggest problem with this is that the wastewater treatment processes are currently not designed to filter out such small particles. Thus, these particles, together with the adhering toxins and pollutants, can enter the environment almost unhindered. Although established technologies such as micro-, ultra- or nanofiltration could filter extremely small particles out of water, these technologies are less suitable for the use in wastewater treatment plants due to the use of a filter medium, resulting in limited flow rates and very high energy consumption. The Solution:Of course, the ultimate solution to this problem would be the complete abandonment of plastic of any kind. Since this solution is utopian, unfortunately, we must prevent the microplastic particles from entering our water cycle.This is where the ECOFARIO technology comes into play:After entering our High-G Separators, the polluted water is forced into heavy rotation (up to 2000 G). Due to these extremely high G-forces, we are able to separate the microplastic particles from the wastewater.    Our patented ECOFARIO technology is based on the hydrocyclone principle and has been modified by us in such a way that it can even separate particles like microplastics, which differ only minimally from water in terms of their density.    The microplastic particles filtered out of the wastewater, together with the adhering toxins and pollutants, are then put into thermal recycling. This is the only way that the particles, and above all the toxins and pollutants, can never get into the environment again.The underlying ECOFARIO effect will also allow us to use our technology in many more fields of application. These are for example separating oil from water after oil disasters or filtering powder coat particles from industrial paint shop wash waters. Who We Are: We are a team of four entrepreneurs and friends from the Munich area in Bavaria, Southern Germany. Each of us has a different vocational background which can be perfectly combined to realize our common goals.Since we are all very close to nature and because water has always been of high importance to our way of life, we feel a very specific motivation to keep our planet as clean as possible.   To support us, just click If you want to have additional information, you can visit our website www.ecofario.eco, contact us directly at info@ecofario.eco, or follow us onFacebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, LinkedIn",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been in the construction industry as a design engineer for the past 14 years and have been part of large-scale infrastructure projects which help to create sustainable living in cities. I have always been interested in improving lives and protecting our planet. I always felt renewable energy is the future but never found a suitable source to make a substantial positive impact to climate change. When I discovered and learnt about Geothermal Energy and its currently untapped potential, I knew this is the energy source that will be a game changer. Therefore, I started UNCHARTED POWER PTE LTD to further Geothermal Development.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are working towards building Geothermal Power Plants to achieve a Fossil Fuel Free Future in Asia. Our first project will be in Myanmar where we have the Myanmar Government's support and we have submitted our proposals for approval.</p>
<p>We are seeking support to fund us in this interim period. We are seeking SGD$200,000 which will be for carrying out Stage 1 Pre-Feasibility tests and studies to select area within the potential site for the next stage detailed testing. Money from your support will go towards:</p>
<ol>
<li>To obtain and testing of water and ground samples from the area</li>
<li>Carrying out chemical analysis of the samples</li>
<li>Ground modeling to identify the site and planning for further detailed tests</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Today, more than 55% of the global energy sources are still fossil fuels which are harmful to our environment and are limited. We need to find ways to replace fossil fuels.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567326081/brf4rzeaoksrmnovqduj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At UNCHARTED POWER PTE LTD, we believe Geothermal Energy have the sufficient and consistent capacity to replace fossil fuels. We are working to further Geothermal Development to realize  a Fossil Fuel Free Future.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Your contributions will allow us to take the first concrete steps towards a Geothermal Power Plant in Myanmar to provide much needed electricity. We will use this as our pilot project for more future Geothermal Power Plants in Asia.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567325790/fx61cp1q3gaffnn7udek.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Presently Geothermal Energy Exploration is not the most accurate which results in high risk and capital cost when selecting the plant sites. Geothermal Energy Exploitation can also be better understood to improve efficiency and safety during the operational phase.  </p>
<p>At UNCHARTED POWER PTE LTD, we seek to collaborate with industry and academic experts to research and improve methods for Geothermal Exploration and Exploitation. We have already in-principle agreements with scientists for collaboration and we intend to use our proposed pilot project in Myanmar as the research site.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Ultimately the mission for UNCHARTED POWER PTE LTD is to replace fossil fuels for power generation. You can help to spread the word and join the movement to help create this change. We need active steps towards climate change to create a cleaner, sustainable future for the next generation.</p>

Therefore, I started UNCHARTED POWER PTE LTD to further Geothermal Development.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We are working towards building Geothermal Power Plants to achieve a Fossil Fuel Free Future in Asia. Our first project will be in Myanmar where we have the Myanmar Government's support and we have submitted our proposals for approval.
We are seeking support to fund us in this interim period. We are seeking SGD$200,000 which will be for carrying out Stage 1 Pre-Feasibility tests and studies to select area within the potential site for the next stage detailed testing. Money from your support will go towards:

To obtain and testing of water and ground samples from the area
Carrying out chemical analysis of the samples
Ground modeling to identify the site and planning for further detailed tests


 
The Impact
Today, more than 55% of the global energy sources are still fossil fuels which are harmful to our environment and are limited. We need to find ways to replace fossil fuels.

 
At UNCHARTED POWER PTE LTD, we believe Geothermal Energy have the sufficient and consistent capacity to replace fossil fuels. We are working to further Geothermal Development to realize  a Fossil Fuel Free Future.

 
Your contributions will allow us to take the first concrete steps towards a Geothermal Power Plant in Myanmar to provide much needed electricity. We will use this as our pilot project for more future Geothermal Power Plants in Asia.


 
Risks & Challenges
Presently Geothermal Energy Exploration is not the most accurate which results in high risk and capital cost when selecting the plant sites. Geothermal Energy Exploitation can also be better understood to improve efficiency and safety during the operational phase.  
At UNCHARTED POWER PTE LTD, we seek to collaborate with industry and academic experts to research and improve methods for Geothermal Exploration and Exploitation. We have already in-principle agreements with scientists for collaboration and we intend to use our proposed pilot project in Myanmar as the research site.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
Ultimately the mission for UNCHARTED POWER PTE LTD is to replace fossil fuels for power generation. You can help to spread the word and join the movement to help create this change. We need active steps towards climate change to create a cleaner, sustainable future for the next generation.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

That's a fact. We need a new source of water that doesn't rely on plastic bottles or wells, since wells are drying up or being poised, and plastic bottles are bad for the environment and are expensive to ship and make. Our product makes fresh water for drinking or farming from the air for places that don't have access to fresh water, but do have access to electricity.  Introducing the DG-10, the world's first Bluetooth-controlled atmospheric water generator. This small machine can generate up to 10 gallons of fresh water from air every day simply by condensing the invisible water vapor all around us, filtering it, and dispensing it for collection and consumption.The mobile app we developed lets you set how much water is made at a time and at what humidity levels the machine should run at for efficiency and indoor atmosphere control.  It also records temperature and humidity to monitor every gallon produced for the life of the machine. As a result, the increased efficiencies can empower farmers to optimize the climate to ensure top quality crops, especially for those horticulturalists who grow indoors.   Use-CasesReuben's JourneyMy passion for making water out of air began 4 years ago when my parents had their water rights threatened by the State of California due to the drought. I was living near Venice Beach and woke up every day to incredible amounts of dew – which led to my lightbulb moment. Why not make a machine that could capture that dew water directly from the air? I started work right away with a humble sheet of tin foil and a pane of glass but, since inventing has been a hobby of mine since childhood, that quickly escalated. Fast forward to today and I feel like I have really tapped into something that can make a real-world impact – plus it was just great fun and challenging to work on. After 4 years, I had learned a ton about condensation, thermodynamics, farming, geometry, the history of water generators, potential markets, the world water crisis, and so much more. I built different machines to fit different market niches and experimented with Peltier devices, solid and deliquescent desiccants, ultrasonic vibrators, and compressors.  But I kept coming back to my parents’ initial concerns with simply watering their olive trees. As agriculture is the main user of water (over 70% of the water in California used for farming, and 69% globally), we realized we could make the greatest impact by reducing the amount of water farmers draw from an outside system. So that became our goal for the DG-10: a machine that made fresh water right where it's needed, helping farmers grow crops by recapturing the vapor their plants let go of and sending it back to their roots. It’s a process we call Water Neutral Farming.The HardwareThe DG-10 will be manufactured with NSF-approved parts and a replaceable 6-stage internal filtration system using a sediment, granular activated carbon, CTO, RO Membrane, Post Carbon, and UV light to purify the water far beyond even the harshest standards. We are also selling an alkalizing filter for those who want to remineralize their water, which makes the water taste great, as opposed to using un-alkalinized water that is basically distilled.The filters are easy to access via a hatch on the front of the machine and will need to be replaced every 6-12 months (depending on filter type) for optimum quality. The water that comes out of this machine before filtration measures at a PH of 6 and is 6 ppm total dissolved solids, which compared to our everyday tap water is 56 times purer.Basically, it’s the freshest water you have ever had, since it's made the day you drink it- water so fresh you can taste it.We are also providing an external float switch which can be used to keep water tanks full. This is a $50 extra and comes with 15 feet of wire and the external float switch. A tank with this float switch mounted inside can be drained, which triggers the machine to turn on when put in autofill setting in app. The SoftwareNot only is our hardware great, but our co-founder and software engineer, Pavel Tikhonenko, developed an app to control the machine.

The Vflux Chip



Vflux chips are electric generators the size of computer chips.  They outperform any other type of generator or energy source in any feature:

Compared to other forms of electricity production, Vflux chips are simply superior.  Whether you compare it to solar panels, nuclear reactors, or oil, Vflux outperforms each and every other type of energy source in price, size, functionality, and more.
       

The Vflux Revolution
Never have a phone or laptop battery die on you again.
Drive your car for tens of thousands of miles without ever stopping for gas.
Run an air conditioner all day, every day.Power your house, your factory, your life, at no continuous cost.
The foundation of our economy is electricity, yet we've been floundering around for the past decade trying to replace fossil fuels.  While other alternatives have been popping up, that's all they've been trying to do -- replace fossil fuels.Vflux goes past that.  With Vflux alone, electricity can become a never-ending no-cost resource that's available everywhere for everyone.  Prices for commodities, luxuries, and even necessities will go drastically down.  Things that were otherwise unfeasible due to their energy cost -- like desalinating and transporting water for the entire world -- will suddenly become viable. And that is just the beginning.  It isn't crazy to think that we could end world hunger, or explore deep space, or more.

   
   


“The Vflux concept for converting solar energy into electrical energy is innovative and the result of a lot of research.”   Ted Van Duzer, PhD Electrical EngineeringProfessor Emeritus UC Berkeley.


The Technology
While we covered it briefly in the main video, here's a more technical video explaining things a bit deeper.
Several of our technical references are at the bottom of this page.In short, each Vflux chip rapidly oscillates between two phases.
GENERATING PHASE:
        
1.  The type II superconductor forms flux vortices when it enters the superconducting state. [1]
2.  These vortices bend magnetic field lines.[2]
3.  Nano coils harvest electricity from the bending of these magnetic field lines, producing the net electricity. [3]
COOLING PHASE:

             
1.  The superconductor leaves the superconducting state and becomes a normal conductor.
2.  Leaving the state in this fashion causes the Superconductor to self-cool.
[4]
3.  Heat flows from the warmer air to the colder superconductor (around -400°F).[5]
4.  Once the superconductor returns to its initial temperature, it can enter the superconducting state and generate again.

                          

“Critical physical processes for Vflux are shown to work by experiments. The benefits are immense.”York Dobyns, PhD Physics  Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University.

Perk Summary







Risks and Challenges
The biggest challenge is also the biggest reward:
We are doing something extraordinary that no one else has ever done.We've proven every aspect of Vflux's processes using various researched, published, and peer reviewed scientific papers and research studies.  We've continued to explain and participate in open and honest about the science.  Despite our attempts, some individuals are set to disbelieve absent of anything but a physical device in their hands.  For these individuals, we've got a dilemma: We cannot get their support to build Vflux until after Vflux is already built.This is why taking the first step and contributing is so crucial.   When we are successful with demonstrating this technology, when it has integrated with our lives, life will be better for everyone.  No one can disagree with that.  In order to overcome this challenge, we are doing our best to teach people so that they can understand how and why Vflux works; so that you can support our cause with confidence.
   
The FundsManufacturing a computer chip is expensive and Vflux chips need specialized tooling beyond even that.  With the money we raise here, we will make/rent the various equipment, masks, tools, and materials we need to produce the first series of Vflux chips and generators.  In addition, it will help cover the costs for fabrication, characterization, refinement, unit testing, optimization, and finally production.While we have been raising money from investors, this campaign will serve as a final push so that we can take this technology off the ground.  Anything you contribute will help, no matter how small.  We will ensure every contributor receives their perks whether or not we reach our financial goal.
FAQ


Q:  Can I add on <Item> to <Pledge>?A:  Yes.  Almost all pledges accept any number and any variety of add-ons.  Simply increase your pledge amount by the total price of all your add-ons.  After the campaign ends, we'll send out surveys so you can tell us what exact items, perks and/or wattages you want.There are only two restrictions:1. No add-ons are allowed for the $20 Contributor Recognition perk.2. We can't allow add-ons from discounted prices or limited perks.  (You can, however, add on additional items to a limited or sale special perk).





Q:  How much is shipping?A:  We offer free shipping to the USA/Canada/Mexica.  To any other location, we charge a flat $15 rate for any order.


Q:  I can't contribute.  How else can I help?A:  Spread the word like wildfire.  Tell your friends, share our campaign on facebook, tweet about us, post about us on sites like tumblr and reddit.   Be a voice. The more people who are aware, the more support we can get to make this a reality.


Q: Are there vents or fans on the smaller devices?A: Neither the Phone Powerpack nor the PUP have any vents or fans.   They are small and efficient enough to not need any.

Q:  How do you know this works?A:  Have you heard the saying ""Measure twice, cut once""?  Well, we've spent the last few years doing nothing but measuring -- running simulations, sifting through scientific experiments and data, creating mathematical equations, getting patents, talking with other professional scientists, and more.  Throughout all of this, every piece of evidence we've ever uncovered has supported Vflux.   It works.


Q:  Is this perpetual motion?A:  No.  Vflux chips require a constant input of energy, which we get from the sun's heat.  Unfortunately, Vflux generators won't run continuously if the sun spontaneously explodes overnight.   They won't operate at all under temperatures of -400°F, and they can't perfectly convert heat into energy.  More scientifically speaking, the process which Vflux uses to harvest energy complies with all laws of thermodynamics: the total entropy of the system increases as RF energy is emitted.  This side effect, while minuscule, is what stops Vflux from being considered perpetual motion despite converting heat into usable electricity.


Q:  Will Vflux generators cool the planet?A: No.  The earth is constantly radiating and losing heat.  This isn't an issue for everyday life because the sun is also constantly supplying the earth with heat.  Vflux generators take the heat that would otherwise be radiated into space and instead convert it into usable electricity.   There is no amount of Vflux generators that could impact the temperature of our planet.





Q:  Does a Vflux powered device need to be left or kept in the sun?A:  No.  Vflux chips work during night, in the arctic, and deep underground.  The only requirement for Vflux powered devices to continue operating is that the room temperature housing the device is warmer than -400°F.

The Technical References


1.  A type II superconductor forms flux vortices under particular conditionsWikipedia: Quantum VortexAbrikosov, A. A. (1957) ""On the Magnetic properties of superconductors of the second group"", Sov.Phys.JETP 5:1174–1182 and Zh.Eksp.Teor.Fiz.32:1442-1452.Details:  When the magnetic field density upon a Type II Superconductor exceeds HC1, vortices form.  Each vortex is a cylindrical shaped region within a superconductor that is not superconducting.  Since the region is not superconducting, the magnetic field lines move to pass through the material at the location of each vortex.
2.  These vortices bend magnetic field lines.Wikipedia: Meissner Effect Tinkham, M. “Introduction to Superconductivity,” 1996, Mc-Graw Hill, NYEkin, J., “Experimental Techniques Low-Temperature Measurements,” Oxford Univ., 2007,  p 410Details:  In regions between the vortices, the superconductor expels the magnetic field by the Meissner effect.  The field lines move into the center of each vortex since superconductivity is suppressed there.
3.  Coils can harvest electricity from the bending of magnetic field lines.Wikipedia: Electromagnetic Induction Maxwell,  James, “A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, Vol. II,” 1904. Third Edition, Oxford University Press, pp. 178–9 and 189.Harrington, R. “Introduction to Electromagnetic Engineering,” 2003. Dover Publications, NY, p 56Deaver, ""Experimental Evidence for Quantized Flux in Superconducting Cylinders,"" 1961 Physical Review Letters 7 (2): 43–46 – (Stanford students measuring the “fluxon”) Details:  A current is induced in a coil while the magnetic field density through it changes.  This is the basis for electricity currently generated by motion.  During the transition into the superconducting state, there is motion of the magnetic flux.  This motion is powered by the increase in free energy, which occurs since the flux that previously permeated the superconductor's surface in the normal state is propelled by the Meissner Effect, pushing it into the center of the vortices where the flux becomes trapped.  The moving flux during the transition causes a change of flux density in the coils, generating electricity by electromagnetic induction.
4.  When the Superconductor leaves the superconducting state, it self-cools under particular conditionsShoenberg, ""Superconductivity,"" 1960, Cambridge University Press, pp 58-59 (equations)Dolecek, R.”Adiabatic Magnetization of a Superconducting Sphere,” 1954 Phys. Rev. 96, 25–28  (US Naval Research Lab)Details: To measure the change in temperature, a superconductor was placed in a vacuum cryostat with a thermo-transducer attached.  The magnetic field strength was stepped up, so the field overcame the superconductor causing the superconductor to enter the normal state while staying below the critical temperature.  The change in temperature of the superconductor was tabulated.  The change in temperature is the Superconductor Magneto-Caloric Effect, also called an Inverse Magneto-Caloric Effect.  Cooling occurs since heat energy is used to increase entropy.  The non-superconducting state is a higher entropy state than the superconducting state.  Since heat energy is converted to entropy, there is less heat and the temperature drops.  During this transition, the magnetic field causes both cooling and heating.  Heating is by eddy currents, yet since the cooling effect is greater than the heating effect, the net effect is a temperature drop.   
5.  Heat flows from the warm to cold Wikipedia: Heat Partington, J. “An Advanced Treatise on Physical Chemistry, Fundamental Principles. The Properties of Gases,” 1949, London: Longmans, Green and Co., p 118Fermi, E. “Thermodynamics,” 1956, Dover Publications, 1956Details:  All matter emits and absorbs heat.  Hotter matter placed next to colder matter will emit more heat than it absorbs.  This makes the hotter item colder and the colder item hotter until they reach equilibrium of temperature.
Equations for changes in free energy at Superconductor transitions are available in various college level books in Solid State Physics that include superconductors.   Our go-to reference for these equations is the following edition (because it is archived online):Kittel, C. “Introduction to Solid State Physics,” 8th ed. 2005, John Wiley & Sons, NJ p 272Details: The change in the available Helmholtz or Gibbs free energy of a superconductor in a magnetic field upon entering or leaving the superconducting state, while staying below Tc, is in proportion to the magnetic field through the volume of the superconductor.  When entering the superconducting state, the free energy increases.  When leaving the superconducting state, the free energy decreases.",48.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>The Power of Waste Heat</strong></p>
<p>There is a hidden source of renewable power all around us that has the potential to provide electricity to charge our phones, spare batteries, and operate LED lights. You can find this power anywhere you find waste heat, like your home furnace or water heater exhaust, car, computer equipment, fireplace or wood burning stove -- or even the sun.</p>
<p>The problem is that the big energy corporations haven't figured out how to make a profit turning everyday, small-scale sources of waste heat into power.  BIG corporations can only make money from BIG energy sources, and waste heat is small power for the little guy.</p>
<p>Tapping into this free power requires thousands of inventors to experiment with different configurations to find out what works and what doesn't.  Like minicomputers in the 1970s, the next energy revolution is more likely to be invented in an empty garage than in a corporate lab.  The Thermopower Inventor's Kit provides everything the next generation of energy inventors needs to get started.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is a Thermoelectric Generator?</strong></p>
<p>Thermoelectric generators use advanced semiconductors to convert temperature difference directly into electricity.  The greater the temperature differential between the hot and cold side, the more energy the TEG will produce, but the TEGs in our Thermopower Inventor's Kit can power an LED bulb at the touch of your hand, using little more than body temperature!</p>
<p>The Department of Energy predicts the market for TEG technologies will grow exponentially to become a multibillion industry over the next two decades.  Right now, these projections are based on really BIG waste heat applications at industrial scale -- using waste heat from immense coal power stations, giant cooling towers for nuclear reactors, and huge steel- or glass-making factories. Not surprisingly, this industrial use market is dominated by powerful players like NASA, Alphabet Energy, and other large-scale waste heat recovery companies.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How Can You Help?</strong></p>
<p>To support renewable energy and clean technologies that will disrupt the corporate energy complex, support our campaign or purchase the Thermopower Inventor's Kit by using the links on the right side of this page. You can also share our campaign on social media by copy/pasting the URL or using the Indiegogo Share Tools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Thermopower Inventor's Kit, A Path to Personal Power</strong></p>
<p>The first commercially available computers were giant, expensive, power-hungry machines that needed whole teams of engineers and scientists to maintain.  But when Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak offered the Apple 1 as a mail-order home hobbyist kit for only $666.66, they launched the personal computer industry that is now worth trillions of dollars worldwide.</p>
<p>We want to bring the potential of thermopower directly to the inventors, home hobbyists, and consumers who can create an energy revolution we call personal power.  By equipping a community of inventors to tinker, share, and experiment with TEG devices, we hope to empower the next Jobs and Wozniak to invent a cleaner, more personal, and democratic energy future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Included?</strong></p>
<p>The inventor's kit includes everything needed to create electric power from waste heat.  Included are two thermoelectric generators, one heat sink, thermal adhesive, and a charge controller.  Additionally, the kit includes an acrylic Fresnel lenses to get you started with your first experiment concentrating sunshine to generate enough heat to charge a cell phone. What's more, inventors can track their power generation using apps like Ampere (available for free through Google play) that turn their cell phones into power meters.  </p>
<p>We are selling the Inventor's Kit at cost because we believe in the mission of empowering everyday inventors and want to promote the use and accessibility of TEGs as alternative renewable energy resources. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is the Inventor's Kit for?</strong></p>
<p>From school students to home hobbyists to established engineers, anyone with an imagination can become a scientist and creator with the Inventor's Kit, discovering new sources of waste heat and building customized devices to capture it and transform it into energy they can use right away. The kit makes a great gift for friends and students interested in science and technology.</p>
<p>Because the use of TEGs to capture waste heat outside of industrial settings is a new application for the technology, supporting the Thermopower movement will create a community of co-inventors working on the cutting edge of new research in small-scale renewable energy.</p>

We are selling the Inventor's Kit at cost because we believe in the mission of empowering everyday inventors and want to promote the use and accessibility of TEGs as alternative renewable energy resources. 
 
Who is the Inventor's Kit for?
From school students to home hobbyists to established engineers, anyone with an imagination can become a scientist and creator with the Inventor's Kit, discovering new sources of waste heat and building customized devices to capture it and transform it into energy they can use right away. The kit makes a great gift for friends and students interested in science and technology.
Because the use of TEGs to capture waste heat outside of industrial settings is a new application for the technology, supporting the Thermopower movement will create a community of co-inventors working on the cutting edge of new research in small-scale renewable energy.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>SORA is a Self-Operated Recycling Appliance for greywater reuse. Greywater comes from the household sink, shower, washing machine, and dishwasher. Our goal is to recycle over 75% of that water right back into the home for reuse (or other uses including irrigation). Even more innovative, it's been engineered to also create a percentage of clean, safe drinking water. This machine has the potential to conserve on a huge scale, to give back to the planet, as well as save money on your water bill.  <strong>*Before donating or purchasing a kit, please read our disclaimer section below.</strong></p>

<h3>What Sets Us Apart</h3>
<p>All current water recycling systems for the household use high-maintenance methods which require constant attention, such as replacing expensive filters and manually monitoring performance. SORA stands apart from existing water recycling; it makes water conservation as effortless as nature intended.  From self-monitoring water quality to managing optimal power sources, the SORA stands alone.</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>The SORA Water Recycler uses technology that does not need any expensive replacement parts or costly maintenance.  It is designed to self-regulate itself and allow you to effortlessly reuse a large percentage of your water from appliances (excluding toilets) and create drinkable water simultaneously.</p>

<p>As a realtor in the Hamptons the need for sound blocking technology has been all too clear for all too long.  ANC (active noise cancelling) does not work on multiple continuously changing sounds, like traffic and construction and landscaping. For years I suggested that this technology was needed...until I finally went back to my roots in Physics (Cornell) and decided to do it myself. Forming Chromodynamics LLC in 2016. </p>
<p>I have been exploring the beauty of sound and magnetic fields in my artwork for years (ReneeDahl.com). And I am continually amazed, that we are only beginning to rediscover the amazingly intricate forces of nature that surround us. We have been so focused on the macro and the micro of the Universe that we have overlooked the potential in the ""aether"" that envelopes our physical existence.</p>
<p>Our first concern is our delicate environment and we hope to use multiples of the earth's own healing frequencies. Testing and development will be extensive to ascertain the most effective frequencies  or layers thereof. We may find that the best solution is in targeted sound, and this avenue will need exploration, and tooling to a much smaller size than the very expensive, and very large emitters currently on the market. Neodymium magnets have a half-life of 700years, so there is little concern that ""the magnets will wear out"". We also have plans for shielding the magnetic fields created in the workings of emitter arrays.</p>
<p>The possibilities of our Array go far beyond Acoustics and it's application in more serious , protective situations is limitless.</p>

I have been exploring the beauty of sound and magnetic fields in my artwork for years (ReneeDahl.com). And I am continually amazed, that we are only beginning to rediscover the amazingly intricate forces of nature that surround us. We have been so focused on the macro and the micro of the Universe that we have overlooked the potential in the ""aether"" that envelopes our physical existence.
Our first concern is our delicate environment and we hope to use multiples of the earth's own healing frequencies. Testing and development will be extensive to ascertain the most effective frequencies  or layers thereof. We may find that the best solution is in targeted sound, and this avenue will need exploration, and tooling to a much smaller size than the very expensive, and very large emitters currently on the market. Neodymium magnets have a half-life of 700years, so there is little concern that ""the magnets will wear out"". We also have plans for shielding the magnetic fields created in the workings of emitter arrays.
The possibilities of our Array go far beyond Acoustics and it's application in more serious , protective situations is limitless.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Necessity of SuperCharging!<br/> </h3>
<p>In 2011 Brandon Nozaki Miller, CEO of digiNow Inc., began hacking his electric motorcycle for racing. One of the first things he realized is to get as much track time as possible he needed to charge the bike FAST. Unfortunately for Brandon, none of the products available on the market could charge his bike fast enough to allow for a full day's racing. From this was born the need for SuperCharging.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541565136/zsxfjcnfvppororp5viu.jpg"" src="""" style=""width:100%;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After a few iterations of chargers for use at the track Brandon's friends, like famed Tourmaster Terry Hershner, took notice of his cool charging setups and tools; they wanted the same for themselves, so Brandon built his friends faster charging setups. It didn't take long until more people recognized how awesome SuperCharging was, and Brandon decided to make the SuperCharger available as a product. </p>
<p> </p>

<div> </div>
<p><br/>He started building SuperChargers in his living room and then moved to his garage as he needed more space. From there Terry Hershner introduced him to the inventor of the motorcycle fairing, Craig Vetter, who has since assisted in finding a more adequate facility for digiNow to grow, prototype, and build the first production units. Over the past year Craig's help has been invaluable to digiNow. But, now it's time to move on to the next level and utilize partners in China to move the current small-scale production to full-scale manufacturing.</p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541629218/wzugsobrypryiqxwyrde.jpg"" src="""" style=""width:100%;""/><br/><br/><br/>The demand for our chargers is so great right now that we can not produce them fast enough in our current facility. The design is solid enough now that, with your help, we can move manufacturing into a facility with the tools and expertise to build SuperChargers quickly and in large enough volumes to supply the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is SuperCharging? <br/> </h3>
<p>SuperCharging is a means of charging your bike, or other electric vehicle, really really fast! More than that, it is intelligent charging. SuperChargers communicate with your battery to monitor information vital to your battery's health, including C rate, temperature, voltage, and cell level data. Not only do they monitor, but the chargers react accordingly as conditions change.<br/><br/>In the end all of this adds up to being able to charge your vehicle at speeds of 3C safely. We keep it limited to 1C for riders of Zero motorcycles that want to keep their warranty, though. Over 1C, even with our fancy algorithm, is limited to advanced users.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Features:</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Full system integration with Zero Motorcycle’s Battery Management System (BMS) to ensure battery longevity, safety and maximum charging speeds.</li>
<li>Powerful charging options upto 10 kW providing over 7.6x faster charging than Zero’s standard 1.3 kW onboard charger.</li>
<li>0-80% charge in as little as 36 minutes with 10kW SuperCharger (based on Zero Motorcycle 13.0 kWh models).</li>
<li>Lightweight and compact design allowing either modular 3.3 kW charge bricks (FX) or 10 kW unit to fit in the same location occupied by Zero’s 1.3 kW onboard charger with included SuperCharger belly pan.</li>
<li>Automatically adjusts charging speed based on battery voltage and temperature to ensure long term battery health.</li>
<li>User configurable option to dramatically increase the motorcycle’s battery life by allowing user to hold charge at a desired percentage (i.e. only charge to 80% every night, similar to Daily/Trip charging options in Tesla vehicles). Zero Motorcycles currently does not offer this option so the motorcycle always charges to 100%, which is not ideal for keeping your battery healthy longer. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>How do these things work?</h3>
<p> <br/>Plug the EV station, or any other source of power into your bike and let the charging begin! US versions come standard with J1772 inlets, and EU versions come with full 3 phase Mennekes Type 2 support. You can also use an Android or iOS device to adjust max power and voltage. Set your bike to only charge up to 80% for extra longevity. You could also have your charger hold your bike at 60% for long term storage if you really wanted.<br/><br/>The short answer, though, is that you <i>just plug it in</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Production &amp; Backer Perks</h3>
<p>DigiNow needs $195,000 USD to move production to a shared facility with TC Charger, Di Long Technology, and DuoSida in China. TC Charger has been a key player in the Chinese EV industry, producing reliable and highly durable for EV manufacturers all over the world. Di Long Technology is one of the most respected and trustworthy facilities for charger development and is focused on helping startups like digiNow make an impact in the EV market. DuoSida is a behind-the-scenes manufacturer of EV charging stations and parts for many other manufacturers with certifications of the highest quality. Di Long Tech was recently awarded the High-Tech Enterprise by the Hebei Provincial Science and Technology Agency. With the help of these partners we have made a product rugged enough for the most challenging of scenarios, and small enough that it fits not just in any car, but also on any motorcycle.</p>
<p><br/>With our latest design we have finally come to a final product which we are already building and delivering in a small scale in Carmel, California. With our partners' help we have been able to source suppliers for parts and materials to build not only our high powered electronics, but also our mounting brackets, PCBs, and EV power inlets. </p>
<p><br/>The funding we collect will be spent on setting up and building our production process and quality checking at the facility in China of 3 Phase &amp; Single Phase supporting chargers to comply with international infrastructure. The 6 places this funding will be used most will be :</p>
<ol>
<li>Reducing product cost (complete)</li>
<li>10kw charger small enough to fit on a motorcycle (complete)</li>
<li>Skid pan or bash pan strong enough to support motorcycle riding (complete)</li>
<li>High power inlets and adapters for around the world (complete)</li>

<p> </p>
<p>The Perks we are offering, for your support in this, are designed to give you exclusive access to the latest products with the highest quality. We understand that a lot of you may already have our v2.5 SuperChargers which were manufactured here in the states and have the same amount of power. For users who already have our v2.5 we have added in stickers, bike tuning, track days, custom rides with Brandon and Terry, or even training from Brandon directly. And, if none of these sound amazing to you, but you still want to support this awesome company and its progress in the EV industry, you can always hit the pink ""BACK IT"" button in the upper right side of this page to show us your support without one of the perks too!<br/><br/>For those of you who are still slow charging with just the Zero onboard charger, or charge tank, we have perks that get you everything you need and more for SuperCharging and Zero Touring training.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>More Than Meets the Eye</h3>
<p><br/>Supporting this product and production process not only ensures that SuperChargers will be available for users across the globe in a timely fashion, but also ensures that the digiNow team can have a little breathing room to develop new products to better your EV.</p>
<p><br/>Currently there is no other company coming up with products as safe or game changing as digiNow. We do it because we love EVs and our passion allows us to see the problems we and others have, and come up with fun, innovative solutions for them. We are more than happy to keep building the products in house ourselves, but we would much rather get our products made with our partners' help so we can keep making awesome solutions for everyone! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><br/>So far, in our 4 years developing the SuperCharger, we have faced MANY risks and challenges. Sourcing quality parts and finding trustworthy vendors has been very difficult. We have had vendors switch product quality on us, and even vendors trying to sell our tech to other companies. We have had to learn about all the individual charge station companies, their choices in implementing the charging standards, as well as international oddities about charging.<br/><br/>Having worked with our partners since 2016 and developing a relationship with their teams, we feel confident we finally have a good set of partners we can rely on. Our teams have good communication, and when we run across difficulties in sourcing materials, parts, or simplifying complicated solutions, we are able to work to successfully overcome any challenge we've come across so far.​ </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Community Support<br/> </h3>
<p>We greatly appreciate support from users, like the amazing Terry Hershner putting the chargers through their paces on cross country motorcycle trips with his trusty companion ""Charger"" the Moto-Husky, and Ben Rich Electric Biker riding from Florida to Maine in all the trecherous weather of the East Coast.<br/>These guys really help us with testing and knowledge-transfer that needs to happen for newer customers who aren't Seasoned Veterans of Electric Touring.<br/><br/>We also have had help with interim documentation from riders such as Brian T. Rice and Kelly Cash. Their help in keeping the community informed on how to use their chargers until this point has been immense and no amount of thanks could ever suffice for their efforts in documenting not just the hardware, but also the apps and how to control your chargers from your phone. Now, with the production units ready, we can finally take full advantage of the community service provided here for official documentation.</p>
<p>But, most importantly, we need to thank members of the community like DoctorBass who helped us design and bring the v2.5 pan to a production ready state. DoctorBass started the project of his own accord after discussing with me what we were working on. His skill and expertise with military-grade products lead to fascinating teamwork and testing which has brought not only a better charger to market, but has allowed us to improve upon Zero motorcycles dramatically.<br/> </p>
<p>Finally, a big thank you to Luke Workman and the other members of the Electric Wizards Association (EWA, straight out of Santa Cruz).  We cannot thank <strong>EVERYONE</strong> in the community enough for their individual support in all the ways they have provided it.<br/><br/>Thank you.</p>

Our team members have very high technical skills, by national and international standards. Our team members have previously participated in global competitions such as Global Hybrid-Electric cars competition, Minesweepers Competition, Formula Student UK Competition, and many others. Our members have performed significantly well and achieved top places. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560967709/hxg9meoojby9xyuhlxon.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3> </h3><h3>About the Competition</h3><p>The International Small Wind Turbine Contest (ISWTC) is a an annual contest in which University student teams from different countries can compete in designing and building the best performing Small Wind Turbine. The competition has main three phases: </p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Design phase</strong> (Completed with outstanding theoretical results and analysis)<br/>Teams should write a full design report in which they describe their design choices, based on theoretical research. In this report they give a description of all systems (mechanical, electrical, electronic and safety systems), provide insight in the affordability, provide mathematical evidence of the turbines capability of withstanding certain load cases etc. The jury will take into account the design report as well as the actual turbine performance in their decision for the overall best design. The jury is formed by independent experts from the wind energy industry.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Building Phase</strong> (In progress)<br/> The teams will now apply their designs. As a finale of this part, the small wind turbines will be put to the test in the wind tunnel at the Technical University in Delft. For a few days, the wind tunnel at the Technical University in Delft will be used to test the performance of the competing small turbines. The turbines will first be inspected on electronics safety and mechanical safety systems, then the turbines will be tested in the wind tunnel. The power output of the turbines is measured and the goal is to get the best power production.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560028836/byzhq1yi35af9ymuwgml.png"" src=""""/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Final phase</strong>, on the last day of contest week, the teams which have tested their turbines in Delft, will move to the Hanze UAS for a final symposium where they can present their creations to an audience. Here a jury of wind energy experts will assess the presentations, together with their performance in the tunnel and their initial design report to conclude a final winner of the contest.</li>

Our team members have very high technical skills, by national and international standards. Our team members have previously participated in global competitions such as Global Hybrid-Electric cars competition, Minesweepers Competition, Formula Student UK Competition, and many others. Our members have performed significantly well and achieved top places.   About the CompetitionThe International Small Wind Turbine Contest (ISWTC) is a an annual contest in which University student teams from different countries can compete in designing and building the best performing Small Wind Turbine. The competition has main three phases: 

Design phase (Completed with outstanding theoretical results and analysis)Teams should write a full design report in which they describe their design choices, based on theoretical research. In this report they give a description of all systems (mechanical, electrical, electronic and safety systems), provide insight in the affordability, provide mathematical evidence of the turbines capability of withstanding certain load cases etc. The jury will take into account the design report as well as the actual turbine performance in their decision for the overall best design. The jury is formed by independent experts from the wind energy industry. 

Building Phase (In progress) The teams will now apply their designs. As a finale of this part, the small wind turbines will be put to the test in the wind tunnel at the Technical University in Delft. For a few days, the wind tunnel at the Technical University in Delft will be used to test the performance of the competing small turbines. The turbines will first be inspected on electronics safety and mechanical safety systems, then the turbines will be tested in the wind tunnel. The power output of the turbines is measured and the goal is to get the best power production.


Final phase, on the last day of contest week, the teams which have tested their turbines in Delft, will move to the Hanze UAS for a final symposium where they can present their creations to an audience. Here a jury of wind energy experts will assess the presentations, together with their performance in the tunnel and their initial design report to conclude a final winner of the contest.
 Why ISWTC competition?
Participating in such an established competition highly develops the undergrad educational system in Egypt through applying theoretical concepts on a professional level through the small wind turbine which applies on the large scale turbines.
We are competing with pioneer and highest research universities in renewable energy in the world. Hopefully, this establishes Egypt in the field.
Our participation in such competition supports Egyptian undergrad students and youth to play a vital role in Egypt's 2030 vision. This vision targets making 45% of Egypt's power source from renewable Energy according to the National Renewable Energy Authority (NREA) reports. 
 What We Need?We are eager to professionally participate and win the competition. Yet, we have a serious financial situation, on grounds of: 
Since the renewable energy field is relatively new, we barely find our components in local markets. We seek most of our items in global markets; this means foreign expensive currency, taxes, and shipping expenses.
Our Wind Turbine manufacturing phase is almost completed. We will then need to cover the expenses of shipping to the Netherlands for the competition.
On the other hand, each contribution is important and even if the target is not reached, we are seeking all ways to get fund and we will make use of each contribution.
We need to cover flight expenses for five team members.
 The ImpactPrototyping our theoretical results will lead to a wind turbine made by Egyptian undergrad students with 40% power coefficient.Renewable energy is the future of the world’s energy. Supporting renewable energy initiatives will raise awareness, generate clean energy, boost the Egyptian economy, increase job chances, and partially cure global warming. Total BudgetThe total budget needed for manufacturing and shipping the Wind Turbine and travelling to the Netherlands is around  6800$ (113000 EGP) divided as follows:
Competition Registration                  680 $        (11300 EGP)

The only problem with this is that our main sources of energy, non-renewable resources, are depleting at a faster rate. Research has shown that in the next 70 years the world's entire oil reserves will run out, and if the current consumption of oil continues it will be much less than that. The simple solution is to use renewable resources such as solar and wind power instead, but even with the obvious answer renewable resources only make up around 15% of all the sources of energy used on Earth. Some of the reason we don't just completely convert over to renewable resources is because most of the machines used to harness the energy are large apparatuses that most people don't have access to. So I thought to myself, what if there was a convenient device that allowed anyone to take advantage of the abundance of renewable resources around them? From this thought the AIRBATTERY was created. A light weight and compact device that uses the power of the wind to gather electricity, appropriate for any lifestyle anywhere. I strive to contribute something beneficial to the universe and this small step in cleaning our energy is only the beginning.</p><p><strong>WHAT IT IS</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477606247/ta1muj83m5nhymhsqr1m.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The AIRBATTERY is a small and light weight power bank equipped with a small wind turbine used to charge its own battery.

<p>It takes about a second for Kokong to work out what kind of device is being inserted. Then, it adapts to the devices and chargers you have plugged into it.

<p><strong>Every night when I used to say goodnight to my daughter,</strong> their smartphone and tablet were typically lying on the bed charging, connected to multiple plugs by the bed.</p>
<p>Given the escalation in the number of fires, close-calls and meltdowns we read about in the media, and the fact that most wall sockets and multipliers are pretty basic and not rigged to handle all the electronics we use in 2019, I decided to change that.</p>
<p>With this product I wanted to remove the human factor, so that our homes would become safer, our electrical bills a bit lower, and our lives a bit easier.</p>
<p><strong>So, when we developed Kokong </strong><strong>we wanted a product that was just as effective if used by a small child, a techie buff or old age pensioners in a home.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Invented and designed in Scandinavia,</strong> we wanted it to nicely fit into the modern home, but also be inspired by Norwegian nature.   We`re proud of bringing the ideas of harmony with nature, simplicity, and design into one product.</p>
<p><strong>Kokong will serve you in at least three key ways:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Kokong turns off power automatically when it is not needed. And ""on"", when it is. By doing this, we reduce energy consumption, impacting our bills. Hence, we change the way we use electricity, from ""always on"" to ""on demand"".</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Kokong will prolong the battery life of your mobile phone or other devices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) By direct consequence of the above, Kokong will prevent risks of fires and other hazards. Kokong increases safety in our homes.</strong></p>
<p>So know this: you`re investing in a product that`s a cool and smart accessory for your devices, but that`s also pretty cool and smart for the planet.</p>
<p>We are the first to make it. You are the first to benefit from it. </p>

Plus, it saves energy and money. All without you having to do anything. No app needed.BBC World News called Kokong: ""One of the only twenty tech products you need to bother about in 2019"".Charges devices AutomaticallyOnce your device is connected, Kokong turns power ""on"" to charge it. Once fully charged, Kokong automatically disconnects power. It also prevents any power surges as well as acting as a safeguard against devices catching on fire. Families can sleep safe thanks to Kokong. 
Better Battery Life For All Your Devices
Kokong disconnects the power supply once your device is fully charged. This prevents trickle charging and prolongs the lifetime and performance of your equipment and batteries.

 
Simple, no app needed!
Kokong is fully autonomous and does not require any installation or app. Just plug it in and it does the work for you. We are bringing an app in late 2019 that will allow you to monitor your energy savings and charging patterns.
 
Simply Plug and Play
Kokong is so easy anyone can use it,  simply plug your devices in and let Kokong do the rest. 

 
Charges Devices Safely
We charge more and more devices in the home and offices. Kokong supervises the charging process so that you can charge anything safely.  Whether you are out, or asleep, or just doing your thing, Kokong does the job for you.

 
No Longer Spend Money On Power You Don't UseKokong disconnects the power supply once your device is fully charged or goes into standby mode. Such ""vampire power"" consumption costs an average household 220$ per year.

Hotels will be safer and save energy by installing Kokong sockets in their rooms.Your office will be ‘off’ after hours, not sucking vampire power at night when there is no one there. 

It takes about a second for Kokong to work out what kind of device is being inserted. Then, it adapts to the devices and chargers you have plugged into it. Kokong switches off the power when your devices are fully charged, meaning you can sleep well at night, plus save unneeded energy consumption. This also prolongs battery life.


It also has a neat circular recess in the socket, so it`s easy to plug stuff in even in the dark or in tight spots. With this feature, the plug will always easily go right in. 
Kokong was designed and developed in Norway. It’s inspired by nature and human habits. When we designed Kokong, the idea was to put humans back in harmony with nature and technology.

The electronics were developed by Lightcircle engineers, who have a track record from aerospace and defense electronics. Kokong is made of the highest quality components in the world. This guarantees a safe, high-quality device you can rely on. And as you can see, we´re a partner with Arrow Electronics - and ""Certified by Arrow"".
We are now all ready to manufacture and then ship Kokong to you. Take a look at this cool Kokong mould below: 
Kokong boxes all dressed up and ready to meet new owners : -)


 

Every night when I used to say goodnight to my daughter, their smartphone and tablet were typically lying on the bed charging, connected to multiple plugs by the bed.
Given the escalation in the number of fires, close-calls and meltdowns we read about in the media, and the fact that most wall sockets and multipliers are pretty basic and not rigged to handle all the electronics we use in 2019, I decided to change that.
With this product I wanted to remove the human factor, so that our homes would become safer, our electrical bills a bit lower, and our lives a bit easier.
So, when we developed Kokong we wanted a product that was just as effective if used by a small child, a techie buff or old age pensioners in a home.
Invented and designed in Scandinavia, we wanted it to nicely fit into the modern home, but also be inspired by Norwegian nature.   We`re proud of bringing the ideas of harmony with nature, simplicity, and design into one product.
Kokong will serve you in at least three key ways:
1) Kokong turns off power automatically when it is not needed. And ""on"", when it is. By doing this, we reduce energy consumption, impacting our bills. Hence, we change the way we use electricity, from ""always on"" to ""on demand"".
2) Kokong will prolong the battery life of your mobile phone or other devices.
3) By direct consequence of the above, Kokong will prevent risks of fires and other hazards. Kokong increases safety in our homes.
So know this: you`re investing in a product that`s a cool and smart accessory for your devices, but that`s also pretty cool and smart for the planet.
We are the first to make it. You are the first to benefit from it. 
We've had a number of Press coverage BBC called us ""One of the top twenty tech products you need in 2019""

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Planetary Consciousness</h3><p>If people could only see the whole planet laid out in front of them, the extent of pollution, the weather patterns, seismic activities, ozone layer depletion, global climate change, polar ice cap melt, species extinction and even economic and political trends and movements, all  in one glance, it would go very far to making people act to fix these problems. What we need is self-awareness on a planetary scale. A planetary bio-feedback device. The Earth Monitor.</p><p>The Earth Monitor is an advanced electronic planetary monitoring system that is interfaced with a computer system that can be fed current and past data and the results used to extrapolate a future scenario and displayed on a <strong><i>360 degree LED globe monitor.</i></strong> The display would combine real-time video of Earth along with stills and graphical data from sources such as DSCOVR, Google Earth and other sources.The hardware is the globe, which can be of any size (I see 12 inches to 10 plus feet) and available to everyone, with streaming data from a central server. The software is the data-integrating, future-scenario extrapolating Artificial Intelligence that is more than a search engine. It would take verbal commands and use old and <strong><i>near real-time</i></strong> data to project the current state of our environment as well as to project future scenarios for weather, economic trends, pollution, population, and other aspects of life on Earth. A voice input such as Siri is also important in giving it personality which is essential to relating to Earth as a living being.</p><p>It is important that the monitor has a 360 degree display as opposed to a mercator map on a flat screen. A flat mercator map is like a lizard on the dissecting table; it shows a 3D object in two dimensions and deadens any feeling of relating to the Earth as something living.</p><p>Everything that happens physically on the planet that could change the environment is input into the computer. For instance, let’s say you want to know how how much carbon the U.S. is putting into the atmosphere and how it's affecting the average temperature around the world. I could command, “Show me the effect of carbon emission in the US and related temperature changes on Earth in the past ten years .” Instead of graphs on the wall, the Earth Monitor would show color coded temperature variances in the world with the ability to show data from the past and displayed in fast motion. It will work with other aspects of life as everything that happens in the world influences each other.</p><p>I believe the hardware, i.e., the globe monitor, is feasible with the current technology that we have now. There are already available on the market numerous electronic globes of varying sizes but none that I know of that processes streaming data from world-wide sensors and instruments to create a near real-time display of planetary conditions. But I know we have the technology. What we need to develop to make the Earth Monitor work is advanced software; an algorithm that can take in all the data that impacts the Earth and use it to extrapolate how it affects life on this planet (the Tensor Flex AI is one option). Then to display it as a near real-time video on a 360-degree display electronic globe so that we can see it whole. Using this info, we can tweak what we do on the planet for optimum affect. Like a planetary bio-feedback device, we can use this technology to make our planet more healthy, peaceful, prosperous and fulfilling. This would literally be a crystal ball that could predict and make very bright the future of our planet. Because once we get a handle on how our planetary environment works in detail, we can do things that can improve it, such as to prevent pollution, catastrophic hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and other disasters. Even providing rain and sunshine where needed. Just as we improve our personal health by doing things that are good for us, we can institute planetary health by doing the right things on a global basis for the optimum well-being of Earth.</p><p>I see the Earth Monitor as belonging to the Earth and everything that makes up the Earth. Like the Internet, it’s for everyone. Owned by everyone. It is a natural process of planetary evolution that will grow and grow, powered by input and contributions from everyone.

What we need is self-awareness on a planetary scale. A planetary bio-feedback device. The Earth Monitor.The Earth Monitor is an advanced electronic planetary monitoring system that is interfaced with a computer system that can be fed current and past data and the results used to extrapolate a future scenario and displayed on a 360 degree LED globe monitor. The display would combine real-time video of Earth along with stills and graphical data from sources such as DSCOVR, Google Earth and other sources.The hardware is the globe, which can be of any size (I see 12 inches to 10 plus feet) and available to everyone, with streaming data from a central server. The software is the data-integrating, future-scenario extrapolating Artificial Intelligence that is more than a search engine. It would take verbal commands and use old and near real-time data to project the current state of our environment as well as to project future scenarios for weather, economic trends, pollution, population, and other aspects of life on Earth. A voice input such as Siri is also important in giving it personality which is essential to relating to Earth as a living being.It is important that the monitor has a 360 degree display as opposed to a mercator map on a flat screen. A flat mercator map is like a lizard on the dissecting table; it shows a 3D object in two dimensions and deadens any feeling of relating to the Earth as something living.Everything that happens physically on the planet that could change the environment is input into the computer. For instance, let’s say you want to know how how much carbon the U.S. is putting into the atmosphere and how it's affecting the average temperature around the world. I could command, “Show me the effect of carbon emission in the US and related temperature changes on Earth in the past ten years .” Instead of graphs on the wall, the Earth Monitor would show color coded temperature variances in the world with the ability to show data from the past and displayed in fast motion. It will work with other aspects of life as everything that happens in the world influences each other.I believe the hardware, i.e., the globe monitor, is feasible with the current technology that we have now. There are already available on the market numerous electronic globes of varying sizes but none that I know of that processes streaming data from world-wide sensors and instruments to create a near real-time display of planetary conditions. But I know we have the technology. What we need to develop to make the Earth Monitor work is advanced software; an algorithm that can take in all the data that impacts the Earth and use it to extrapolate how it affects life on this planet (the Tensor Flex AI is one option). Then to display it as a near real-time video on a 360-degree display electronic globe so that we can see it whole. Using this info, we can tweak what we do on the planet for optimum affect. Like a planetary bio-feedback device, we can use this technology to make our planet more healthy, peaceful, prosperous and fulfilling. This would literally be a crystal ball that could predict and make very bright the future of our planet. Because once we get a handle on how our planetary environment works in detail, we can do things that can improve it, such as to prevent pollution, catastrophic hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and other disasters. Even providing rain and sunshine where needed. Just as we improve our personal health by doing things that are good for us, we can institute planetary health by doing the right things on a global basis for the optimum well-being of Earth.I see the Earth Monitor as belonging to the Earth and everything that makes up the Earth. Like the Internet, it’s for everyone. Owned by everyone. It is a natural process of planetary evolution that will grow and grow, powered by input and contributions from everyone. The more near real-time information about this planet we can gather with our sensors, instruments, observations and the better we get at integrating and coordinating this data into a whole, the more awesome the potential of this endeavor.

<h3>About zeAC</h3>
<p><strong>zeAC</strong> is a simple climate control system and consists of the Air-Con Cylinder that produces cooling when you add water, and potted plants that consume CO2 and release fresh oxygen in your home.</p>
<p>Simply refill tank with water every morning. The evaporation of water from the micro porous surfaces of the cylinder material cools the room. Additionally, the material dehumidifies the room by absorbing vapour from air or humidifies a dry room by releasing vapour into the air.</p>
<p>More cooling happens with the absorption of heat into the cold cylinder body. Plants, nourished by the constant draw of vapour and nutrients, digest CO2 and other gases, while supplying fresh oxygen. You end up with a micro-climate of stable humidity and cool comfort, all day.</p>

<p><strong>1. Zero Electric: </strong>This means no bills for cooling. The Air-Con Cylinder does all the cooling with Water.</p>
<p><strong>2. Simple. </strong>Just add water (cooling), or no water (heating)</p>
<p><strong>3. Multi-climate:</strong> The zeAC works in both dry and humid climates. Give it 80% humidity and it will still keep cooling and dehumidifying your home.</p>
<p><strong>4. Fresh Natural Air: </strong>Plants and the Air-Con Cylinder ensure supply of constant fresh air by absorbing C02 and other dangerous gases and releasing fresh oxygen into the air in your room all day.</p>
<p><strong>5. Active Dehumidifier and Humidifier: </strong>It manages to maintain constant comfortable humidity all day.</p>
<p><strong>6. Solid State: </strong>Silent and no moving parts. Just add water and remain cool all day.</p>
<p><strong>7. Portable: </strong>Place anywhere in your home. There are no walls to break and no pipes to lay.</p>
<p><strong>8. Scalable: </strong>Add as many as you need for your effective cooling comfort all over your home.</p>
<p><strong>9. Multifunction: </strong>Add the Basic Power or Sense package to add illumination and device charging or power to your home with the solar powered options. Effectively go off grid.</p>
<p><strong>10. Beautiful: </strong>You can never go wrong with having lots of Air-Con Cylinders and beautiful plants that keep the air fresh in your home.</p>

<h3>But how does zeAC work?</h3>
<p>Using basic thermodynamic principles <strong>zeAC</strong> is able to cool or heat a room via latent vaporization or condensation heat. The unit functions in two different ways depending on seasons and ambient temperature.</p>
<p>The <strong>zeAC</strong> draws vapour from the room to the cylinder at any temperature.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495378662/wvuouqydrpwnmwsvuyja.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Hot Day Behaviour:</strong></p>
<p>For dry air warmer than the Air-Con Cylinder, water in the Air-Con Cylinder evaporates at a faster rate, absorbing latent heat from the room, effectively cooling up the room and also humidifying it in the process.</p>
<p>For humid air warmer than the Air-Con Cylinder, water in the cylinder evaporates at a slower rate, absorbing latent heat from the room, effectively cooling up the room and also dehumidifying it in the process.</p>
<p>Works best with walls and windows that are shaded from the direct exposure to intense sunlight. If your walls are exposed to direct sunlight, you will need more per square feet for cooler sensation.</p>

<p>For dry air colder than the Air-Con Cylinder, saturated vapour in air condenses on a dry cylinder at a slower rate, radiating the latent heat of condensation from the cylinder into the room, effectively warming up the room and also humidifying it in the process.</p>
<p>For a humid air colder than the Air-Con Cylinder, saturated vapour in air condenses on a dry cylinder at a faster rate, radiating the latent heat of condensation from the cylinder into the room, effectively warming up the room and also dehumidifying it in the process.</p>
<p>Because of the micro porous surface of the Air-Con Cylinder the condensed vapour is trapped in the mass, effectively dehumidifying the room.</p>
<p>A heating element MAY periodically add small amounts of heat to keep the Air-Con Cylinder at a higher temperature (36°C for example), resulting in 24°C or higher temperature and low humidity in winter climate tests at -1 °C.</p>

<p><i>zeAC, the most energy efficient and economical climate control system is a product of my very diverse background. I started first as a painter and conceptual artist, moved to become a university lecturer, and later founded a software technology company. I also  founded the Centre for Technology Innovation in Lagos, Nigeria. In many ways, my view of the world has been shaped by my exposure to these different disciplines and life across four continents - Africa, Europe, Asia, America.</i></p>
<p><i>Energy has been a problem on my mind for many years. It affected me on a personal level while living mostly without electrical power in the concrete jungle that is Lagos, Nigeria. The country generates a paltry total of under 4000 MW of electricity. While my 2.5Kv petrol generator could support almost all my appliances, it was not powerful enough for air conditioners. If you have been in the sweltering heat of March and April in Lagos, you will recognise how inconsequential power can be if you can’t handle space cooling with it.</i></p>
<p><i>Analysing my energy load showed clearly that I was using almost 90% of the energy I supply to my home for cooling loads. Up to 70% of the electrical energy in hot and humid climates goes to cooling loads. This analysis led to a logical conclusion - solving cooling also resolves the energy quagmire.</i></p>
<p><i>To do this, we must decouple the cooling and heating loads from grid electricity. With this decoupling, 4000 MW will go a long way in a place like Nigeria. There must be a better way to keep cool than the vapour compression refrigeration technology offers, a device that requires as much as 4000 watts to start in air conditioning applications.</i></p>
<p><i>At this realisation, I started looking for alternatives and recalled the behaviour of the earthen pot from my childhood. I remembered fetching cold water from my grandmother's earthen water pot. I began to explore how this water stayed colder than the ambient temperature and then understood the physics of evaporative cooling behind it. I saw parallels between the behaviour of the pot and the Earth's system for cooling itself. From here we started engineering materials to mimic nature and provide support for hot and humid climates.</i></p>
<p><i>To achieve this, I turned to material science, focusing on locally available materials. I teamed up with my co-founder Caius, and we started exploring materials and fabrication techniques that could yield optimal evaporative media, and work effectively in hot and humid climates. The result of this enquiry is the Air-Con Cylinder.</i></p>
<p><i>Air Conditioners consume the most share of the energy the world generates. By supporting the Air-Con Cylinder, you contribute to an important solution to Global Warming on Earth. </i></p>
<p><strong>Dedication</strong></p>
<p><i>I dedicate the Air-Con Cylinder (named by my daughter Uzoma) and the zeAC System, to Mother Earth first, and to my loving wife Pui-Ying, and my daughters Uzoma and Akunna. Without their humanity, I would not have done it.</i></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>1. We are looking for $200,000 to setup initial manufacturing of the zero electric version. This will buy an industrial kiln for larger scale production of our first 1000 units. This will cover cost of purchase and shipping of other machinery. We will add a manufacturing expert to the team to help with the manufacturing setup.</p>
<p>2. Then we need $50,000 to design and complete the prototyping of the electronics and sensing aspects of the assembly. These include, connectivity and control of lights from a mobile app, monitoring micro climate data for various clusters of cooling units in a given location, motion detection for energy optimisation of lights, and power supply battery bank for lights, and any electronics in the optionally powered version. With this we should be prepared for the completed product and be production and distribution ready in 4 months to 6 months.</p>
<p>Every supporter will get a zero electric version.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The earth strains as a result of our energy problem. To put it simply, if we don't resolve the cooling problem, the energy quagmire would persist, and worse, so would global warming. We must minimise electricity consumption of air-conditioning. Our zeAC not only solves the problem, but solves it elegantly.

</div></div>","About zeAC
zeAC is a simple climate control system and consists of the Air-Con Cylinder that produces cooling when you add water, and potted plants that consume CO2 and release fresh oxygen in your home.
Simply refill tank with water every morning. The evaporation of water from the micro porous surfaces of the cylinder material cools the room. Additionally, the material dehumidifies the room by absorbing vapour from air or humidifies a dry room by releasing vapour into the air.
More cooling happens with the absorption of heat into the cold cylinder body. Plants, nourished by the constant draw of vapour and nutrients, digest CO2 and other gases, while supplying fresh oxygen. You end up with a micro-climate of stable humidity and cool comfort, all day.

Early Prototype

In live testing zeAC consistently cools down the room temperature to about 26°C while over 40°C outside in Lagos, and 77°F in 105°F heat in Maryland USA afternoon outside temperature. No sweating or thermal discomfort was recorded in the room.




See a demonstration of a cooled room here
 

For any home and office

As an alternative to regular AC units, zeAC’s small size and good looks makes it easy to integrate the unit anywhere you want. Use the zeAC mounted in a flower pot and it will not only brighten your room but also cool it! Who said feng shui was difficult?

One unit is suitable for a room of about 100 - 150 square feet, so you can approximate how many units your house or office requires.

What makes zeAC special?

1. Zero Electric: This means no bills for cooling. The Air-Con Cylinder does all the cooling with Water.
2. Simple. Just add water (cooling), or no water (heating)
3. Multi-climate: The zeAC works in both dry and humid climates. Give it 80% humidity and it will still keep cooling and dehumidifying your home.
4. Fresh Natural Air: Plants and the Air-Con Cylinder ensure supply of constant fresh air by absorbing C02 and other dangerous gases and releasing fresh oxygen into the air in your room all day.
5. Active Dehumidifier and Humidifier: It manages to maintain constant comfortable humidity all day.
6. Solid State: Silent and no moving parts. Just add water and remain cool all day.
7. Portable: Place anywhere in your home. There are no walls to break and no pipes to lay.
8. Scalable: Add as many as you need for your effective cooling comfort all over your home.
9. Multifunction: Add the Basic Power or Sense package to add illumination and device charging or power to your home with the solar powered options. Effectively go off grid.
10. Beautiful: You can never go wrong with having lots of Air-Con Cylinders and beautiful plants that keep the air fresh in your home.

But how does zeAC work?
Using basic thermodynamic principles zeAC is able to cool or heat a room via latent vaporization or condensation heat. The unit functions in two different ways depending on seasons and ambient temperature.
The zeAC draws vapour from the room to the cylinder at any temperature.

Hot Day Behaviour:
For dry air warmer than the Air-Con Cylinder, water in the Air-Con Cylinder evaporates at a faster rate, absorbing latent heat from the room, effectively cooling up the room and also humidifying it in the process.
For humid air warmer than the Air-Con Cylinder, water in the cylinder evaporates at a slower rate, absorbing latent heat from the room, effectively cooling up the room and also dehumidifying it in the process.
Works best with walls and windows that are shaded from the direct exposure to intense sunlight. If your walls are exposed to direct sunlight, you will need more per square feet for cooler sensation.

Hot Day Indoor and Outdoor Humidity

See a demonstration of a cooled room here
Cold Day Behaviour:

For dry air colder than the Air-Con Cylinder, saturated vapour in air condenses on a dry cylinder at a slower rate, radiating the latent heat of condensation from the cylinder into the room, effectively warming up the room and also humidifying it in the process.
For a humid air colder than the Air-Con Cylinder, saturated vapour in air condenses on a dry cylinder at a faster rate, radiating the latent heat of condensation from the cylinder into the room, effectively warming up the room and also dehumidifying it in the process.
Because of the micro porous surface of the Air-Con Cylinder the condensed vapour is trapped in the mass, effectively dehumidifying the room.
A heating element MAY periodically add small amounts of heat to keep the Air-Con Cylinder at a higher temperature (36°C for example), resulting in 24°C or higher temperature and low humidity in winter climate tests at -1 °C.

Powerful, Natural Air Purification - Recommended Plants
These plants are recommended because, compared other plants, they absorb more CO2 and other gases that are not good for you, and supply more oxygen to refresh the air in your room.

zeAC, the most energy efficient and economical climate control system is a product of my very diverse background. I started first as a painter and conceptual artist, moved to become a university lecturer, and later founded a software technology company. I also  founded the Centre for Technology Innovation in Lagos, Nigeria. In many ways, my view of the world has been shaped by my exposure to these different disciplines and life across four continents - Africa, Europe, Asia, America.
Energy has been a problem on my mind for many years. It affected me on a personal level while living mostly without electrical power in the concrete jungle that is Lagos, Nigeria. The country generates a paltry total of under 4000 MW of electricity. While my 2.5Kv petrol generator could support almost all my appliances, it was not powerful enough for air conditioners. If you have been in the sweltering heat of March and April in Lagos, you will recognise how inconsequential power can be if you can’t handle space cooling with it.
Analysing my energy load showed clearly that I was using almost 90% of the energy I supply to my home for cooling loads. Up to 70% of the electrical energy in hot and humid climates goes to cooling loads. This analysis led to a logical conclusion - solving cooling also resolves the energy quagmire.
To do this, we must decouple the cooling and heating loads from grid electricity. With this decoupling, 4000 MW will go a long way in a place like Nigeria. There must be a better way to keep cool than the vapour compression refrigeration technology offers, a device that requires as much as 4000 watts to start in air conditioning applications.
At this realisation, I started looking for alternatives and recalled the behaviour of the earthen pot from my childhood. I remembered fetching cold water from my grandmother's earthen water pot. I began to explore how this water stayed colder than the ambient temperature and then understood the physics of evaporative cooling behind it. I saw parallels between the behaviour of the pot and the Earth's system for cooling itself. From here we started engineering materials to mimic nature and provide support for hot and humid climates.
To achieve this, I turned to material science, focusing on locally available materials. I teamed up with my co-founder Caius, and we started exploring materials and fabrication techniques that could yield optimal evaporative media, and work effectively in hot and humid climates. The result of this enquiry is the Air-Con Cylinder.
Air Conditioners consume the most share of the energy the world generates. By supporting the Air-Con Cylinder, you contribute to an important solution to Global Warming on Earth. 
Dedication
I dedicate the Air-Con Cylinder (named by my daughter Uzoma) and the zeAC System, to Mother Earth first, and to my loving wife Pui-Ying, and my daughters Uzoma and Akunna. Without their humanity, I would not have done it.


What We Need & What You Get
1. We are looking for $200,000 to setup initial manufacturing of the zero electric version. This will buy an industrial kiln for larger scale production of our first 1000 units. This will cover cost of purchase and shipping of other machinery. We will add a manufacturing expert to the team to help with the manufacturing setup.
2. Then we need $50,000 to design and complete the prototyping of the electronics and sensing aspects of the assembly. These include, connectivity and control of lights from a mobile app, monitoring micro climate data for various clusters of cooling units in a given location, motion detection for energy optimisation of lights, and power supply battery bank for lights, and any electronics in the optionally powered version. With this we should be prepared for the completed product and be production and distribution ready in 4 months to 6 months.
Every supporter will get a zero electric version.


The Impact
The earth strains as a result of our energy problem. To put it simply, if we don't resolve the cooling problem, the energy quagmire would persist, and worse, so would global warming. We must minimise electricity consumption of air-conditioning. Our zeAC not only solves the problem, but solves it elegantly. It fills your home with plants that clean the air and feed you fresh oxygen, while keeping you nice and comfortable all year round - without noise or moving parts, and no financial cost for energy.
 
All the Energy here comes from around you - Air, Water and the Heat in your home.


Risks & Challenges
Working with my team members Rosu and Caius, I have cleared the toughest part. It took 11 months of developing and testing the material to achieve the results we have today. The next phase is designing and testing of the electronics and sensing systems by our inhouse team of electronics and software engineers, Maduka, Paul and Isaiah. The initial manufacturing of electronics component and packaging will be outsourced, while materials fabrication and assembly will be done internally.

<p>Just one Kinetic Energy Unit system set in an area with 10,000 vehicles per day will save over 803 lbs of CO2 emissions per year from being added to the atmosphere. With the
addition of Kinetic Energy Units to our streets and highways we could offset
that footprint by re-capturing the energy of each vehicle that is currently
being lost.</p>
<p>The Kinetic Energy Units are installed in roadways, off
ramps and at intersections, where a strike on a compression mechanism captures
kinetic motion from your vehicle and converts it into metered power to be
distributed to storage or the grid.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449764514/heejrr3pfj7fnecgxzmo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>To put it in perspective, the average residential household

<p>We have demonstrated through advanced computer modeling that a
single pair of Kinetic Energy Units will produce 1.3MW Hours per year in a
location with traffic of 10,000 vehicles / day. 
This is comparable to any four-lane intersection in most medium sized
towns or cities producing enough power to largely offset traditional power

</div></div>","CONSTRUCTIS is an alternative energy company developing
Kinetic Energy solutions to “Move Energy Forward.”
We’re intent on bringing to market the worlds first Kinetic Energy Units to capture
the energy created from one of our biggest everyday headaches “Traffic” and use
it to power the world.
“Read our Impact section to learn how Kinetic Energy can reduce your
taxes, lower your power bill and are cheaper than solar and wind
solutions.”
Just one Kinetic Energy Unit system set in an area with 10,000 vehicles per day will save over 803 lbs of CO2 emissions per year from being added to the atmosphere. With the
addition of Kinetic Energy Units to our streets and highways we could offset
that footprint by re-capturing the energy of each vehicle that is currently
being lost.
The Kinetic Energy Units are installed in roadways, off
ramps and at intersections, where a strike on a compression mechanism captures
kinetic motion from your vehicle and converts it into metered power to be
distributed to storage or the grid.  
A single Kinetic Energy Unit installation in a low traffic area will produce on
average 2 kWh of power or more per day, turning daily traffic into one of the
largest sources of alternative power. 
To put it in perspective, the average residential household
uses 32 kWh of power per day.  Installing these systems around your city in high traffic areas will power entire neighborhoods on a daily
basis.
We have demonstrated through advanced computer modeling that a
single pair of Kinetic Energy Units will produce 1.3MW Hours per year in a
location with traffic of 10,000 vehicles / day. 
This is comparable to any four-lane intersection in most medium sized
towns or cities producing enough power to largely offset traditional power
consumption in most areas.
For
a comparison, an average 2 lane highway has between 100,000 to 150,000 vehicles
/ day…imagine capturing that power!
Traditional Solar and Wind solutions require large areas of
dedicated land and are often not effective or feasible in urban areas.  Our Kinetic Energy Units have the ability to
transform alternative energy collection in urban environments and improve the
sustainability of our towns and cities. Modeling of RESS system installed in urban environment

Our Kinetic Energy Units have the lowest capital
construction costs of any energy source with no infrastructure needs.
Meaning
we can add substantial electricity capacity at a fraction of the cost of a new
power plant, with zero carbon emissions.
The power generated from our Kinetic Energy Units can
support net metering, battery back up or direct use.
Kinetic Energy Units are the Urban alternative to wind and solar,
are highly cost competitive with those alternative energy technologies and
require no subsidies or land needs.
With
your endorsement, we’ll receive an official Dept. of Energy “Alternative
Energy” designation in 2016 to increase our Nations use of alternatives.
Our Kinetic Energy Units are Zero Emission, climate
resilient, and intelligently networkable through embedded operating
intelligence software. 
Help
us disrupt the energy market and provide another option for our Cities!

We’ve built and tested our prototype in simulation software
and proven a number of amazing capabilities. 
Now we need your help to get our first sets of prototypes funded and
built.V1 modeling of the RESS Concept - We've significantly evolved between V1 and V4!
We’ve got opportunities to install our systems at multiple
port locations across the southeast to capture power from the continual traffic
of trucks entering and leaving the ports. 
Now we just need your help to build them!V1 modeling for kinetic energy capture from vehicles.
We need to raise at minimum $100K to build our initial set of
prototypes. 
One
unit will be for ongoing Research and Development (R&D) and the other unit
will be installed at a Port facility for field testing We’re looking to go further
and much bigger and with your help we can surpass our goals as future clients are already waiting!
We’ve found some amazing perks to highlight our campaign
that will not only keep you safe on the go but have you doing it in style while
staying cool!  We appreciate all your
support and even the smallest donation will help bring our dream of Kinetic
Energy Units to life!
Help
us challenge big energy and push our product through the closed doors of our
Government system!  WE WANT CLEAN ENERGY! 

Kinetic Energy Modules are our lives work and have been in
design since 2007.  We’ve got the patent,
all the trademarks.  We’ve done the
studies, worked the figures and now we’re ready to get them in the ground and start producing power.
Our scientific name for the Kinetic Energy Unit is the
Roadway Energy Sensory System or (RESS). 
We envision each RESS system as being a pivotal support system to the
future of smart roadways and the Internet Of Things movement to support
connected roadway systems.
RESS Systems will support intelligent monitoring of our bicycle lanes, streets and highways, enable future connected car systems, provide power to
support electric vehicles, enhance roadway safety systems and even reduce your taxes!
Wait?  What? Reduce my
taxes?  Yes, you read that
correctly.  The power our RESS systems
put back into the grid could be used to offset your local municipal budgets,
resulting in reduced tax burdens and better-maintained roadways and cities.
Further, adding the power back into the grid will also help
offset your local cost of energy, reducing your overall energy prices for your
area.  
Imagine
having the RESS installed at your City parking lots and powering City lights.  And lets talk about the technology
costs.  Power from Kinetic Energy Units
will be cheaper than Solar and Wind, specifically for Urban applications.  We
think solar and wind have great applications and are an integral part of our Nations
energy solution, but we are excited to lead in the age of kinetics!  Our challenge is to open a new door in a closed energy market and only
with your help will we be able to do this. 
Your endorsement is literally a vote to move this product to market!

Our RESS Kinetic Energy Units will have
the lowest capital costs of ANY alternative power generating solution!


We’ve got over 25 years experience in commercial
construction and roadway development throughout our careers.  Our team has installed over 2.5 Billion in

Relatively maintenance free (if grass filled: requires only basic lawn care)
Self-cleaning as rain water washes dust away
Weather resistant, no deterioration 
Leaf Clearing: use low blower speed
Broom sweep occasionally
Winter considerations for snow removal:  simply snowplow 1 inch above the grid-paver, or use a rubber tip blade. Use only a 2-Stage Snow Blower and use the risers to adjust auger level.  There should not be any “black ice” as the snow/ice melts directly down through the grid-paver.

Permeable pavements benefit tree health by providing additional air and water to nearby roots.
Permeable pavements are less likely to form ice on the surface than conventional pavements.
Permeable Grids offer excellent landscaping application for use as “Tree-Bed,” which can replace expensive steel gratings and concrete blocks that suffocate trees.
Some permeable pavements can be used to achieve LEED credits.

<h2>2020 Vossahedron Prototype</h2>
<p><strong>The Vossahedron is a Multidimensional Consciousness Art &amp; Biofuturism Science Project.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Indiegogo campaign is focused on securing the resources &amp; final team to prototype an 18 ft diameter x 9 ft high advanced dome structure</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>Vossahedron Project </strong>involves the manufacturing of a modular aluminum concrete form as a mold so we can pour an innovative green aircrete high performance concrete mixture that will result in one wedge section of the Vossahedron sacred geometry shape .  This process is repeated 6 times to complete a full dome shell.  We then finish the structure with hexagonal windows and a door.  This completed basic structure is to be utilized as a <strong>groundbreaking instrument </strong>to study its <strong>quantum effects</strong> utilizing cymatic resonance fields of sound, coherent light, structured water, coherent electricity, designer magnetics, crystal lattices, and plasma states as subtle energy modalities for the <strong>regeneration of the traumatized human body</strong> and <strong>amplification of our innate consciousness abilities</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2020 Project Milestones</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Manufacture aluminum concrete form in <strong>Silver City, New Mexico (April to June)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Secure a prototype <strong>land site</strong> for initial concrete tests<strong> (To be decided)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Complete 1 of 6 dome wedges in stages with final concrete mix <strong>(July/Aug)</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Initial structural <strong>performance tests </strong>and documentation of research findings <strong>(Sept/Oct)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Train an advanced construction team</strong> and produce complete media package, Vossahedron building plans and Center of Mass Creation site master plan <strong>(Nov)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Secure larger land site</strong> for the prototyping of initial <strong>Center of Mass Creation</strong> energy research labs housed in Vossahedron structures <strong>(Throughout Summer)</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p><b>2020 Budget</b></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Prototype aluminum concrete form/mold $12,000</b></li>
<li><b>Vossahedron structure prototyping &amp; performance testing $24,000</b></li>
<li><b>​Securing &amp; preparing permanent Center of Mass Creation land site $108,000</b></li>
</ol>
<p><b>​Budget includes construction equipment purchases, operating expenses and labor</b></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Problem and Market Need</strong></h3>
<p><strong>At the global level we are experiencing a proven desperation for independence from: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Costly mortgages</li>
<li>Increased expenses of utilities &amp; cost of ownership</li>
<li>Increased costs of medical services</li>
<li>Houses and home products that contribute to chronic disease </li>
<li>Toxic living environments that are forced on families</li>
<li>Psychological and physical damage from stressful lifestyles</li>
<li>The breakdown of communities and forced labor for survival</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> At the local level we have reached a deliberate saturation of:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Wasteful, Antiquated and Toxic home construction methods</li>
<li>Prohibitive home purchasing and home building prices</li>
<li>Limited housing options and outdated forms of urban design</li>
<li>Restrictive building codes and municipal ordinances based on greed</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The cost of our housing, health, and lifestyle problems is immeasurable </strong><br/> The opportunity for Sustainable Housing and Eco-Communities at the global and local levels begins with the offering of a new kind of home optimized for raw land as a turn-key package. <br/>Our solution is to roll-out a modular platform for new eco-communities for conscious regeneration positioned to transform entire towns and a transitional template for seeding entire eco-cities of our Biofuture.</p>

2020 Vossahedron Prototype
The Vossahedron is a Multidimensional Consciousness Art & Biofuturism Science Project.
This Indiegogo campaign is focused on securing the resources & final team to prototype an 18 ft diameter x 9 ft high advanced dome structure.
The Vossahedron Project involves the manufacturing of a modular aluminum concrete form as a mold so we can pour an innovative green aircrete high performance concrete mixture that will result in one wedge section of the Vossahedron sacred geometry shape .  This process is repeated 6 times to complete a full dome shell.  We then finish the structure with hexagonal windows and a door.  This completed basic structure is to be utilized as a groundbreaking instrument to study its quantum effects utilizing cymatic resonance fields of sound, coherent light, structured water, coherent electricity, designer magnetics, crystal lattices, and plasma states as subtle energy modalities for the regeneration of the traumatized human body and amplification of our innate consciousness abilities.
2020 Project Milestones

Manufacture aluminum concrete form in Silver City, New Mexico (April to June)
Secure a prototype land site for initial concrete tests (To be decided)
Complete 1 of 6 dome wedges in stages with final concrete mix (July/Aug)
Initial structural performance tests and documentation of research findings (Sept/Oct)
Train an advanced construction team and produce complete media package, Vossahedron building plans and Center of Mass Creation site master plan (Nov)
Secure larger land site for the prototyping of initial Center of Mass Creation energy research labs housed in Vossahedron structures (Throughout Summer)

2020 Budget

Prototype aluminum concrete form/mold $12,000
Vossahedron structure prototyping & performance testing $24,000
​Securing & preparing permanent Center of Mass Creation land site $108,000

​Budget includes construction equipment purchases, operating expenses and labor
 
Problem and Market Need
At the global level we are experiencing a proven desperation for independence from: 

Costly mortgages
Increased expenses of utilities & cost of ownership
Increased costs of medical services
Houses and home products that contribute to chronic disease 
Toxic living environments that are forced on families
Psychological and physical damage from stressful lifestyles
The breakdown of communities and forced labor for survival

 
 At the local level we have reached a deliberate saturation of:

Wasteful, Antiquated and Toxic home construction methods
Prohibitive home purchasing and home building prices
Limited housing options and outdated forms of urban design
Restrictive building codes and municipal ordinances based on greed

 
The cost of our housing, health, and lifestyle problems is immeasurable  The opportunity for Sustainable Housing and Eco-Communities at the global and local levels begins with the offering of a new kind of home optimized for raw land as a turn-key package. Our solution is to roll-out a modular platform for new eco-communities for conscious regeneration positioned to transform entire towns and a transitional template for seeding entire eco-cities of our Biofuture.

 

We are committed to changing the mindset of one community at a time by creating workable models of sustainability, coexistence, and wellness that can inspire surrounding communities to follow suit.


Our team defines Sustainable BioArchitecture as being a conscious solution featuring:


Intelligent Form – Geometry for the site, the house, and the furniture based on ancient wisdom & natural law optimized to flow with Earth’s electromagnetic energy and proportioned to amplify life-force (Chi, Prana, Orgone)

Living Water - Solutions to harvest and structure water from the air and the ground using magnetic, sound, light and crystal technologies in our water filtering process

Healing Food - Integrated facilities for efficiently growing & preparing heirloom organic super-nutrition for DNA repair

Off-grid Energy in Freedom – Human-friendly Earth battery, Magnetic, Plasma and Tesla & Searl energy technology

Bio-Architecture – Efficient biomimicry design balancing heat/cold throughout the year, naturally adapted for each site, non-toxic materials, extreme weather/earthquake resistant and an integrated part of a bio-community

Conscious regeneration - Biofuturistic technology coherently imprinted with clear intent in the geometry, energy modalities and natural earth building materials .  Each day a person lives inside a monolithic Vossahedron instrument is one day less of aging.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Who We Are </strong></h3>
<p>Hello and Welcome!</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting us here at Indiegogo and sharing your valuable time with us. If you watched the opening video, then you saw portions of the Monshaat Innovate 2019 Competition held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that we competed in with our new technology, RPS-G1, our patented and award-winning <strong><i>Centrifugal Induced Wind Turbine Generator</i></strong>.</p>
<p>It was extremely surprising (but totally awesome!) to have our company referred to as ""Aramco #2"", a $2 Trillion company! Happily we are NOT an oil company, but the inference was impactful; Renewable Power Sources LLC will be a company that impacts the world and the way things are done.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>We are very fortunate to have won 1st Place and the Gold Medal in that competition!</strong></i></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/K5dKU-zsR04?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>It's been a long, hard road with a lot of blood (literally!), sweat, and tears.</p>
<p>Years spent away from our families and friends, salaries, savings, and 401Ks decimated, pride swallowed, hundreds of meetings attended and presentations given, sleeping in the car for conferences and exhibitions participated in, proudly eating Ramen noodles because its all we can afford, and still we press on in spite of it all. </p>
<p>As a globally-minded group of people, our company Renewable Power Sources is a small business that reflects our values, and represents a dream realized for all of us working to do something to help make the world our children are growing into, a better and healthier place.</p>
<p>We are garage tinkerers, soldiers, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, daughters and sons, who envision something better, for those we love, and for the world.</p>
<p>This campaign is the embodiment of our drive to bring our technology to fruition. To change the world, period. Creating mountains of waste byproducts, some of it very toxic, that will start to rear their ugly peaks beginning about a decade from now is not something we feel is responsible or ethical, so we're <i><strong>DOING</strong></i> something about it.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Our technology can produce all the electricity we need, as the human species, with zero-emissions, 100% recyclable equipment, and at a fraction of the cost and none of the waste of current renewables.</strong></i></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is RPS-G1?</h3>
<p>Very simply put, RPS-G1 (<strong>R</strong>enewable <strong>P</strong>ower <strong>S</strong>ources - <strong>G</strong>eneration <strong>1</strong>) is a new type of electric generator that is capable of producing electricity at utility scale through mechanical means, without the need for fossil, bio-, nuclear, or solar sources. It is scalable, 100% recyclable, produces power 24/365, and its only byproduct is heat.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597030689/bhk1eho6ewytkq7ygtyi.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596562406/qitve0qjapkcutm8oskj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Truth In Cost:</strong> <i>Several state and federal government tax credits, grants, and loan programs are available for qualifying renewable energy technologies and projects. The costs of those technologies and projects are diluted by taxpayers and/or governments.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>The cost per MW for RPS-G1 is not subsidized or incentivized.</strong></i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>We have chosen crowdfunding because we have discovered that regardless of who you meet with and discuss with, whether CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, Vice Presidents, Ministers, Cabinet Members, or even Royalty such as H.R.H. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, who by the way told Fahad, the inventor of RPS-G1, that we are ""<i>the pride of the Nation</i>"", that although they may all love our idea or believe that we have an amazing technology, they just can't or won't commit.</p>
<p>And, even though we won 1st Place in the Monshaat Innovate 2019 Competition, we did not receive the support, nurturing, or direct investment that we were promised as an incentive for all participants to strive for while competing.</p>
<p>In the world of venture capital, we have been given a lot of praise for what we have achieved, but then in the same breath they tell us how they would love to invest except that their massive investments in other renewables just won't allow them to.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when we receive investment proposals, the would-be investors want a ridiculous percentage of equity and full control. Very simply, this will NEVER happen. We have a certain way of doing things, a plan to bring this technology to the world, and although we are a for-profit venture, there are things that we plan to do with those profits for the nearly 1-billion people living with very limited, or no access at all, to electricity. These things won't happen if we hand over the reins to the money-hungry.</p>
<p>With the problems of climate change accelerating, we don't have time for uncertainty, and we as the human collective can take our future into our own hands, and <strong>RPS-G1</strong> is where we start.</p>
<p>It can harness the energy market in a straightforward manner to help accelerate low-carbon/low-emissions behavior globally, without the need for an all-encompassing international climate treaty, negotiations over rules, green credit trading schemes, nearly impossible coordination, or endless technical negotiations and political maneuvering.</p>
<p>We need <strong>YOUR</strong> help to move our technology through the valley of death , because without your help, our technology that can cost-effectively and cleanly deal with our growing climate and  waste problems, is unlikely to materialize now rather than later, when the problems will be nearly insurmountable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Join us in taking our climate and energy futures into our own hands, and take action <u><strong>NOW</strong></u>.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596567108/vkk9mbpffoxewuklior4.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Your Impact<strong> </strong>
</h2>
<p>What you will be helping us to achieve is monumental: <strong><i>eliminating</i> </strong>nearly 50% of greenhouse emissions from energy production and general industry, <i><strong>providing </strong></i>power 24/365 (zero intermittency),  <i><strong>powering</strong></i> the energy-hungry technologies that can clean up the mess we've made in the atmosphere, <i><strong>bringing</strong></i>  reliable power to the nearly 1 billion people living with limited or no access to electricity, and <i><strong>creating</strong></i> jobs and healthier economies worldwide, <i><strong>building</strong></i> a clean, stable energy future for all of us.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THAT</strong> is what you will be a part of. <strong>THAT</strong> is what <strong>YOU</strong> can help us do.</p>
<p>Our plan is to recognize every individual who believes in what we are doing and makes a contribution to making RPS-G1 a reality for the world.</p>
<p>For all of you who have the vision to see the opportunity to help create a better world for all of us and make ANY donation to help achieve it, you will ALL receive a Letter of Thanks and Appreciation signed by the Inventor of RPS-G1, Mr. Fahad Abdulaziz Abduldayem.</p>
<p>For those who are able to make larger contributions, additional perks may include (depending on the amount of the donation) having your full name, with the name of the city, state, and country you live in inscribed,  as well as having your photograph added to the Wall of Visionaries that we plan to build as the capstone of our first official RPS-G1 Utility-scale Power Plant.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What If We Don't Reach Our Goal?</h3>
<p>There is always the chance that we won't reach our goal. We chose Flexible Funding for our campaign for the simple reason that we absolutely need every penny to keep moving this project forward. It's a matter of necessity. That's the long and short of the matter. The more money we are able to raise, the closer we get to bringing this technology to life, and to the world.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Idea</h3>
<p>In the early spring of 2009, our Chairman and the inventor of RPS-G1, Fahad Abdulaziz Abduldayem of Saudi Arabia, had an idea. At the time, he was living in Rancho Cucamonga, California with his wife and 3-year-old son, and waiting to be accepted for admission to CalPoly.</p>
<p>While he waited, he bought a conversion kit for his car, a 1992 Honda Civic. The kit was to convert the car from a combustion engine to full-electric power, and though Fahad was able to get the conversion done without any issues, he realized that the maximum range for the newly converted car was about one-hundred miles.</p>
<p>Annoyed to no end, he started thinking about ways to increase the driving range of the battery pack. Along these lines of thought, he was working on the car in the garage one morning, thinking about the whole alternator/generator train, and he had an idea. A new type of generator that uses mechanical means instead of gas or diesel fuels to generate power, but something was missing.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever had a moment when you know something, but you don’t know how you know?</strong></p>
<p>With his idea running around in his head and just out of range of that cliched ‘Eureka!’ moment, Fahad packed up his wife and 3-year-old son and headed to the local playground to let his little one run amuck for a bit.</p>
<p>While they were there, Fahad’s wife pointed at the old-style merry-go-round that some of the kids were playing on. You know the one? Kids sit on it and an adult, or another kid, push it around faster and faster until everyone riding it is spinning like mad and holding on for dear life? All the while, the merry-go-round is trying to launch all passengers in every direction? Yeah, that one!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>From that moment, the project that started off as a desire to be more environmentally conscientious and maybe wring a few more miles out of a battery pack, became a discovery that could produce electricity on a utility-scale; massive amounts of power with no negative environmental effects.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need: $12,000,000</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Woah! That's a LOT of money, but I can tell you, even with our penny-pinching and Ramen noodle eating, that money is going to be stretched to the very limit. ""Plan for the worst-case scenario"" is our motto, and we've discovered that when you're working to change the world, and fighting to swim against an almost all-powerful current (the renewable energy industry status quo), the worst-case scenario is always hovering just over our shoulders.   </p>
<p>This campaign is focused on securing the resources &amp; final team to prepare, plan for, and build a <strong>20m x 20m x 9m, 720 kW RPS-G1 unit</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Cards-on-the-table breakdown:</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Phase 1</u> - $5,000,000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Engineering</strong> - we need a lot of engineers, and we have been working with them for several years. We have reached the point of fine tuning in preparation for building our proof of concept/prototype. We have worked with companies such as <strong>Altran</strong> and <strong>Siemens</strong> in the development of certain aspects of our technology.</p>
<p>$5,000,000 is going to get us to prototype stage.  This will cover the costs of contracting the engineering we need in order to finalize our design specifications, the development of our Facility Operations &amp; Predictive Maintenance Software, as well as cover operating and administrative costs.</p>
<p>The engineers we are working with are in the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanical</li>
<li>Aerodynamics</li>
<li>Electrical</li>
<li>Material</li>
<li>Industrial</li>
<li>Manufacturing</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we need to work with software developers in order to build and maintain the systems that will regulate and monitor the entire RPS-G1 power plant, from predicting module failure by identifying potential mechanical problems within any particular RPS-G1 module, to disengaging individual RPS-G1 modules for maintenance or replacement while maintaining continuity of power generation. </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong><u>Phase 2</u> - $7,000,000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prototyping</strong> - The RPS-G1 prototype process will allow us to conduct testing of the structure as it relates loadbearing, wind pressures, and turbine efficiency, as well as to finalize our integrated step-down transformer consoles that split power generated for RPS-G1 utilization and transmission of power to a substation. The prototype will also assist system design in order to perfect the Facility Operations &amp; Predictive Maintenance Software we are developing.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <strong>RPS-G1 Prototype Project </strong>will encompass the manufacturing of a single modular high-performance unit that will demonstrate its capability to produce power cleanly, efficiently, and with minimal space requirements in comparison to other renewable energy technologies.</p>
<p>Since RPS-G1 is modular, it means that although the modules function collectively as a single power producing system, each unit can be independently modified, repaired, or exchanged without shutting down the entire system. That said, the prototype will serve to help finalize turbine blade design through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) of Air Flow Analysis.</p>

</div><div><p><strong>Challenges to Energy Innovation</strong></p></div><div>
<p>Innovation is a complex process with many different stages and inherent risks. It requires a large investment of time and money before any positive effects become visible.</p>
<p>The biggest risks we face are the most obvious, like lack of funds to finalize our work, indifference from those in positions that could help accelerate the introduction of RPS-G1 to the world, and naysayers that don't believe our technology works who spread misinformation through their ignorance.</p>
<p>There are many other risks, but the ones we mentioned above have had the biggest impact on our ability to get RPS-G1 to the world.</p>
<p><strong>Major challenges we face:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lack of a True Innovation Ethos:</strong> Historically within the energy industry, the focus has not been on new ""plug and play"" or ""out-of-the-box"" solutions. Most energy companies have never encouraged a true innovation philosophy. They have simply contracted others to develop solutions for problems. </li>

</div><p>Anything you can do to help us bring RPS-G1 to world will be appreciated more than you know!</p></div>","Who We Are 
Hello and Welcome!
Thank you for visiting us here at Indiegogo and sharing your valuable time with us. If you watched the opening video, then you saw portions of the Monshaat Innovate 2019 Competition held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, that we competed in with our new technology, RPS-G1, our patented and award-winning Centrifugal Induced Wind Turbine Generator.
It was extremely surprising (but totally awesome!) to have our company referred to as ""Aramco #2"", a $2 Trillion company! Happily we are NOT an oil company, but the inference was impactful; Renewable Power Sources LLC will be a company that impacts the world and the way things are done.
We are very fortunate to have won 1st Place and the Gold Medal in that competition!

 
It's been a long, hard road with a lot of blood (literally!), sweat, and tears.
Years spent away from our families and friends, salaries, savings, and 401Ks decimated, pride swallowed, hundreds of meetings attended and presentations given, sleeping in the car for conferences and exhibitions participated in, proudly eating Ramen noodles because its all we can afford, and still we press on in spite of it all. 
As a globally-minded group of people, our company Renewable Power Sources is a small business that reflects our values, and represents a dream realized for all of us working to do something to help make the world our children are growing into, a better and healthier place.
We are garage tinkerers, soldiers, mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, daughters and sons, who envision something better, for those we love, and for the world.
This campaign is the embodiment of our drive to bring our technology to fruition. To change the world, period. Creating mountains of waste byproducts, some of it very toxic, that will start to rear their ugly peaks beginning about a decade from now is not something we feel is responsible or ethical, so we're DOING something about it.
Our technology can produce all the electricity we need, as the human species, with zero-emissions, 100% recyclable equipment, and at a fraction of the cost and none of the waste of current renewables.
 
What is RPS-G1?
Very simply put, RPS-G1 (Renewable Power Sources - Generation 1) is a new type of electric generator that is capable of producing electricity at utility scale through mechanical means, without the need for fossil, bio-, nuclear, or solar sources. It is scalable, 100% recyclable, produces power 24/365, and its only byproduct is heat.

Brass Tacks Comparison

Truth In Cost: Several state and federal government tax credits, grants, and loan programs are available for qualifying renewable energy technologies and projects. The costs of those technologies and projects are diluted by taxpayers and/or governments.
The cost per MW for RPS-G1 is not subsidized or incentivized.
 
Why Crowdfunding?
We have chosen crowdfunding because we have discovered that regardless of who you meet with and discuss with, whether CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, Vice Presidents, Ministers, Cabinet Members, or even Royalty such as H.R.H. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, who by the way told Fahad, the inventor of RPS-G1, that we are ""the pride of the Nation"", that although they may all love our idea or believe that we have an amazing technology, they just can't or won't commit.
And, even though we won 1st Place in the Monshaat Innovate 2019 Competition, we did not receive the support, nurturing, or direct investment that we were promised as an incentive for all participants to strive for while competing.
In the world of venture capital, we have been given a lot of praise for what we have achieved, but then in the same breath they tell us how they would love to invest except that their massive investments in other renewables just won't allow them to.
On the other hand, when we receive investment proposals, the would-be investors want a ridiculous percentage of equity and full control. Very simply, this will NEVER happen. We have a certain way of doing things, a plan to bring this technology to the world, and although we are a for-profit venture, there are things that we plan to do with those profits for the nearly 1-billion people living with very limited, or no access at all, to electricity. These things won't happen if we hand over the reins to the money-hungry.
With the problems of climate change accelerating, we don't have time for uncertainty, and we as the human collective can take our future into our own hands, and RPS-G1 is where we start.
It can harness the energy market in a straightforward manner to help accelerate low-carbon/low-emissions behavior globally, without the need for an all-encompassing international climate treaty, negotiations over rules, green credit trading schemes, nearly impossible coordination, or endless technical negotiations and political maneuvering.
We need YOUR help to move our technology through the valley of death , because without your help, our technology that can cost-effectively and cleanly deal with our growing climate and  waste problems, is unlikely to materialize now rather than later, when the problems will be nearly insurmountable.
Join us in taking our climate and energy futures into our own hands, and take action NOW.

Your Impact 

What you will be helping us to achieve is monumental: eliminating nearly 50% of greenhouse emissions from energy production and general industry, providing power 24/365 (zero intermittency),  powering the energy-hungry technologies that can clean up the mess we've made in the atmosphere, bringing  reliable power to the nearly 1 billion people living with limited or no access to electricity, and creating jobs and healthier economies worldwide, building a clean, stable energy future for all of us.
THAT is what you will be a part of. THAT is what YOU can help us do.
Our plan is to recognize every individual who believes in what we are doing and makes a contribution to making RPS-G1 a reality for the world.
For all of you who have the vision to see the opportunity to help create a better world for all of us and make ANY donation to help achieve it, you will ALL receive a Letter of Thanks and Appreciation signed by the Inventor of RPS-G1, Mr. Fahad Abdulaziz Abduldayem.
For those who are able to make larger contributions, additional perks may include (depending on the amount of the donation) having your full name, with the name of the city, state, and country you live in inscribed,  as well as having your photograph added to the Wall of Visionaries that we plan to build as the capstone of our first official RPS-G1 Utility-scale Power Plant.
What If We Don't Reach Our Goal?
There is always the chance that we won't reach our goal. We chose Flexible Funding for our campaign for the simple reason that we absolutely need every penny to keep moving this project forward. It's a matter of necessity. That's the long and short of the matter. The more money we are able to raise, the closer we get to bringing this technology to life, and to the world.
 
The Idea
In the early spring of 2009, our Chairman and the inventor of RPS-G1, Fahad Abdulaziz Abduldayem of Saudi Arabia, had an idea. At the time, he was living in Rancho Cucamonga, California with his wife and 3-year-old son, and waiting to be accepted for admission to CalPoly.

The kit was to convert the car from a combustion engine to full-electric power, and though Fahad was able to get the conversion done without any issues, he realized that the maximum range for the newly converted car was about one-hundred miles.
Annoyed to no end, he started thinking about ways to increase the driving range of the battery pack. Along these lines of thought, he was working on the car in the garage one morning, thinking about the whole alternator/generator train, and he had an idea. A new type of generator that uses mechanical means instead of gas or diesel fuels to generate power, but something was missing.
Have you ever had a moment when you know something, but you don’t know how you know?
With his idea running around in his head and just out of range of that cliched ‘Eureka!’ moment, Fahad packed up his wife and 3-year-old son and headed to the local playground to let his little one run amuck for a bit.
While they were there, Fahad’s wife pointed at the old-style merry-go-round that some of the kids were playing on. You know the one? Kids sit on it and an adult, or another kid, push it around faster and faster until everyone riding it is spinning like mad and holding on for dear life? All the while, the merry-go-round is trying to launch all passengers in every direction? Yeah, that one!

 
Breakthrough.
 

 
From that moment, the project that started off as a desire to be more environmentally conscientious and maybe wring a few more miles out of a battery pack, became a discovery that could produce electricity on a utility-scale; massive amounts of power with no negative environmental effects.
 
What We Need: $12,000,000

Woah! That's a LOT of money, but I can tell you, even with our penny-pinching and Ramen noodle eating, that money is going to be stretched to the very limit. ""Plan for the worst-case scenario"" is our motto, and we've discovered that when you're working to change the world, and fighting to swim against an almost all-powerful current (the renewable energy industry status quo), the worst-case scenario is always hovering just over our shoulders.

Risks & Challenges
Challenges to Energy Innovation
Innovation is a complex process with many different stages and inherent risks. It requires a large investment of time and money before any positive effects become visible.
The biggest risks we face are the most obvious, like lack of funds to finalize our work, indifference from those in positions that could help accelerate the introduction of RPS-G1 to the world, and naysayers that don't believe our technology works who spread misinformation through their ignorance.
There are many other risks, but the ones we mentioned above have had the biggest impact on our ability to get RPS-G1 to the world.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We created this tester to be able to charge and discharge batteries in a single go, be it small or large cells with up to 20A discharge and at least 10A charge (10A confirmed stable, higher than that is still being calibrated in the design and can theoretically go as high as 20A with cooling). With small software tweaks, we can go from capacity testing to longevity cycling and data logging. The beauty of an arduino based device is you can easily adapt it to your own needs.</p>
<p>At RePowered Batteries, we process thousands of cells, and so efficiency is key in making our business viable. Theses tools we've created for ourselves would not have been possible without all the open hardware and software platforms out there, so it's only fair that we share it back with the community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising funds by selling early production units. The software for battery testing is mostly complete, and working reliably. The data logging features have not yet been re-integrated, but did work in past hardware versions that are no longer compatible. This means we know we can get it done, but it's just a matter of doing it. Software upgrades will be free as the project is open sourced (<a href=""http://www.pabl-o.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pabl-o.com</a>) and all the code is available for modifications.</p>
<p>Hardware features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Charging current and discharging current limits</li>
<li>short circuit prevention (in case faulty custom code is used)</li>
<li>hardware selection of the charging voltage and hardware based fine tuning of the voltage</li>
<li>compatible with multiple cell holder size and types</li>
<li>auxiliary battery input through XT60 for large or unusuall cells</li>
<li>Rack style board for the use of many testers at once</li>
<li>LED MOSFET indicator so you know for sure which fet is on/off when testing code</li>
</ul>
<p>Software features</p>
<ul>
<li>Open sourced software to integrate your own decision rules</li>
<li>two main software versions available for battery testing or longitudinal endurance testing and data logging</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Test small or large cells for cheap, all with a single device.</p>
<p>Data logging of cell cycling normally requires expensive equipment or dedicated computers, not so with this independent SD card based device.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We already had working devices, along with basic software. We did do a redesign with new MOSFETs and a different DC-DC converter. It is Texas Instrument brand so we trust it, but we have not done extended tests on it yet. Now we want the community to get involved and help push the development along further and faster!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Know how to program? We are looking for people to help us clean up our code. Or spread the word.</p>
<h3>Future Development</h3>
<p>Right now, the software does the cell cycling and capacity measurement, but there are extra ports for features we are working on.  There are 2 temp probe ports for ambient temperature and cell temperature, having both allows for an adjusted cell temperature that accounts for local conditions. We also have the microSD card slot for data logging, and the rotary encoder for selecting the number of cycles / mode of operation. Once enough data has been collected, we plan on using charge/discharge differences to find heaters without the need for a temperature probe.

</div></div>","Short Summary
We created this tester to be able to charge and discharge batteries in a single go, be it small or large cells with up to 20A discharge and at least 10A charge (10A confirmed stable, higher than that is still being calibrated in the design and can theoretically go as high as 20A with cooling). With small software tweaks, we can go from capacity testing to longevity cycling and data logging. The beauty of an arduino based device is you can easily adapt it to your own needs.
At RePowered Batteries, we process thousands of cells, and so efficiency is key in making our business viable. Theses tools we've created for ourselves would not have been possible without all the open hardware and software platforms out there, so it's only fair that we share it back with the community.

What We Need & What You Get
We are raising funds by selling early production units. The software for battery testing is mostly complete, and working reliably. The data logging features have not yet been re-integrated, but did work in past hardware versions that are no longer compatible. This means we know we can get it done, but it's just a matter of doing it. Software upgrades will be free as the project is open sourced (www.pabl-o.com) and all the code is available for modifications.
Hardware features:

Charging current and discharging current limits
short circuit prevention (in case faulty custom code is used)
hardware selection of the charging voltage and hardware based fine tuning of the voltage
compatible with multiple cell holder size and types
auxiliary battery input through XT60 for large or unusuall cells
Rack style board for the use of many testers at once
LED MOSFET indicator so you know for sure which fet is on/off when testing code

Software features

Open sourced software to integrate your own decision rules
two main software versions available for battery testing or longitudinal endurance testing and data logging


The Impact
Test small or large cells for cheap, all with a single device.
Data logging of cell cycling normally requires expensive equipment or dedicated computers, not so with this independent SD card based device.

Risks & Challenges
We already had working devices, along with basic software. We did do a redesign with new MOSFETs and a different DC-DC converter. It is Texas Instrument brand so we trust it, but we have not done extended tests on it yet. Now we want the community to get involved and help push the development along further and faster!

Other Ways You Can Help
Know how to program? We are looking for people to help us clean up our code. Or spread the word.
Future Development
Right now, the software does the cell cycling and capacity measurement, but there are extra ports for features we are working on.  There are 2 temp probe ports for ambient temperature and cell temperature, having both allows for an adjusted cell temperature that accounts for local conditions. We also have the microSD card slot for data logging, and the rotary encoder for selecting the number of cycles / mode of operation. Once enough data has been collected, we plan on using charge/discharge differences to find heaters without the need for a temperature probe. We also want to add IR measuring, but specifically IR measuring at 80% capacity which is where the battery is at its optimal IR level (which is where manufacturers measure it of course).",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>So, how does HiveLend work?</h3>
<p>Pollination brokers help connect bees with farmers, so think of us as a pollination broker meets Uber, but for bees. (Yea, my uber driver wouldn't love that either). But we also want to help those beekeepers that aren't yet making money through pollination, get into the pollination game! Some of these are sideline beekeepers and they have over 500,000 of the hives in the United States, today! Those crops that could be performing better, (I'm looking at you, cotton and berries) well, we are here to provide those crops with the bees necessary to BEE the best that they can! </p>

Some of these are sideline beekeepers and they have over 500,000 of the hives in the United States, today! Those crops that could be performing better, (I'm looking at you, cotton and berries) well, we are here to provide those crops with the bees necessary to BEE the best that they can! 

We're so glad you asked!!
Nick and Dawn are beekeepers in Baltimore. The two met this past summer as fellows of the 2017 Venture for America Fellowship. They built a bond over beekeeping, and that’s where HiveLend was born! Dawn has been beekeeping since she was fourteen when she saved up money to buy her first hive and went to bee school instead of high school(kind of...not really, does homeschooling count). Nick began beekeeping in college when he was seeking a connection to food systems and nature. 
 

Well, we are asking for you to bee a part of pollination and the HiveLend Team with your donations!
Contributions made to this campaign will allow for the set up and purchase of educational apiary in Baltimore, Maryland and will also provide funds for the platform development of our website (www.hivelend.com). And in exchange we want to offer you some sweet as honey perks! 
 

What will we be using the funds from this campaign for?
We're fundraising to support the launch of an educational apiary in Baltimore, MD and further development of the HiveLend platform. Every $2500 raised will support a hive and allow us to contribute new features to the website. Keep an eye out if you are in Baltimore, you may just see our hives on a roof or two!


Why Might this Bee Risky Bee-siness?
Nick and Dawn know that they will encounter obstacles on the path to making HiveLend’s goals a reality. A substantial portion of the funds will go towards website development for www.hivelend.com, which is why Nick and Dawn have reached out to web development groups with a track record of success, to build out the necessary features.
We will also need beekeepers and farmers to use our website, which is why we have attended local agricultural meetings, beekeeper association meetings, and are writing articles for grower association newsletters.


We Would Love for You to be a part of the HiveLend Team
Please help us by sharing this campaign, spreading the buzz on HiveLend by tweeting about us @HiveLend and checking us out on Facebook @HiveLend!!
A note on crop pollination: We believe that those currently engaged in pollination are doing a great job feeding this country. We want to enable farmers and beekeepers who had not previously worked with one another able to do so with greater ease.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Vertical farming can feed us all, but...</h3>
<p>Vertical farming has the potential to feed sustainably the present human population and the three billion more that will arrive on this planet in the next 30 years. It is the practice of growing crops in vertically stacked layers. It often incorporates controlled-environment agriculture, which aims to optimize plant growth, and soilless farming techniques such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. Vertical farming allows to use 90% less water, <strong>95% less land</strong> and emits <strong>70% less carbon dioxide</strong> compared to conventional agriculture. Thanks to modern technology vertical farms are a reality. However, the biological aspects of vertical farming have received limited attention compared with the technological aspects. With artificial light and nutrient solutions, plants in protected environments have different requirements from the open fields, still, the varieties we are growing today in vertical farming were originally selected for the open field. The varieties on the market are covered by copyrights. More often vertical farmers ask for varieties able to grow better in their systems.</p>

No need to wish for rain here, water is provided fresh and clean. Not even need to dig deep in the soil with the roots to search for nutrients trapped in the soil, they are provided with the water. In these conditions, there is no need for big leaves and long roots and the energy can be re-allocated to produce fruits. </p>

<p>In the words of J. Kloppenburg Jr.: ""<strong>The plant is the irreducible core of crop production on the farm and the most fundamental agricultural input.</strong>"" To obtain a plant a seed is needed. Who controls the seeds controls the food. We believe that for vertical farming to become a sustainable alternative to conventional agriculture it has to remain accessible to everyone and that centralized control on the production has to be avoided. In the present scenario, breeders have exclusive control over the propagating material (including seed, cuttings, divisions, tissue culture) and harvested material (cut flowers, fruit, foliage) of a new variety for a number of years according to the Plant breeders' rights (PBR), also known as plant variety rights (PVR). The PBR was instituted by the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV Convention) in 1961. The enforcement of these rights led to a reduction of biodiversity and plants' adaptability to the environment. Recently, alternatives to the copyright system have been proposed. By using open-source licenses it is possible to ensure that the varieties and their propagation material remain accessible to everyone. Kasveista will release the new varieties with an open-source license.

You are asking for a relevant amount of money, what if you do not reach the target? We are confident that we are going to reach the target and start full speed in a few months. However, if we do not get to 100 % of our target, this will change speed, not direction. We will start slower and smaller confident that in little time we will grow.

We would like to hear from you
Please, if you have any question do not hesitate to contact us at info@kasveista.com

Other Ways You Can Help
You cannot give any money? No worries, there are many other ways you can help us reach our goal.
For example, you can share this page with your friends.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>solartrees mission is to create a healthy sustainable solar ag cooperative which benefits our environment in northern alberta and beyond, solar energy will be an important feature of our cooperative as well as industrial hemp and other organic crops.  the cooperative has use of land for growing, revenue streaming and financing with three properties to start, 162 acres with a 25,000 sq/ft building for a research and hemp cluster as we want to use 100% of this amazing plant</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for $100,000 to kickstart the cooperative which will be used to build our first solar farm and hempbarn on highway 63 land to be held in trust by all members of the coop. We have land offered already therefore this fund raiser can  exchange cash for land shares and/or perks of our industry. The perks are part of our sustainable living programs for those who prefer something tangible instead of the intangible of a ground floor opportunity that this cooperative represents. The board will have an invested interest also and open to barter as lack of funds should not hinder those who want to get involved</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>the cooperative will impact solar energy installations in northern alberta(first system is a Electric Vehicle charger on highway 63 between edmonton and Fort Macmurray) creating micro-generation for our members and partner coops, farmer run processing for value-added goods, Our processing plant will use biomass for energy creation and expand to producing biodiesel for our farmers and members and as this is a social business we  invest in research and development of organic crops including hemp, solar micro-generation for building a Solar REA(Rural Electrification Associations.) to canvas for a premiums on green energy for all solar energy producers in alberta and as the Watershed is a big issue in northern alberta with tail ponds, leakage and oil spills we will support the keepers of the athabasca and similiar groups and open to parnerships with other indigenous groups such as the Metis settlements and those striving for sustainable living where mother nature weighs. Given half the chance we will solarize, enrich the soils of our farmers and enable the indigenous to share in our cooperative networks and partner with us TO BUILD COMMUNITY</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>the challenge is the cost of initial solar farm to launch, costs of solar micro-generation for members as well as how we can use hemp to improve our healthy living practices as well as lack of money.</p>
<p>therefore, we will partner with a potential solar provider(s) to make financing easier, encourage members to provide assets on loan to improve the bottom line and cooperate with other coops to improve economies of scale. THERE ARE ALREADY 3 COOPERATIVES WHO WISH TO WORK WITH US AND SEVERAL INTENTIONAL COMMUNITIES AND INDIGENOUS GROUPS </p>
<p>also, we will diversify into international markets to ensure a market for our members projects which will include a south american cooperative for superfoods, sharing our research facility with other coops and members to better develop and encourage sustainable living and to better develop healthy foods and medicines as well as a cooperative sponsorship in Madegascar,  africa to grow hemp and other crops and envision an intern/volunteer program here exclusive to our cooperative network with members considered first though this project is not for anyone as there are huge health risks and heart-breaking conditions, some time here will change you forever. </p>

<p>Making pure ethanol as well as delicious vodkas, gins, rums, whiskeys, and liqueurs from unique African ingredients not only creates distinctive and delicious spirits, it generates hundreds of jobs for people and funds waste oil (and eventually plastic) recycling. We will make very cool drinks from banana, molasses,  palm trees sap, palm sugar, cocoanut sugar, sugar cane juice, corn, millet, cassava,  and sorghum. I love fresh palm wine so I am eager to capture its crazy ""cocoanut water on steroids"" deliciousness in a wine or liqueur.</p>
<p>Diesel and ethanol work well together! Our diesel fuels our generators to run our mobile distilleries and the methanol and acetone which are byproducts of the distillation process are used in our diesel fuel. But the real magic is that <strong>two ethanol machines</strong> will create enough profits to buy us <strong>one waste oil to diesel machine a month!</strong> In one year we will have<strong> 10 diesel machines </strong>removing<strong> 4000 liters </strong>of <strong>waste oil </strong>from being<strong> dumped, creating businesses for people,  </strong>and <strong>creating a high quality, low-cost community fuel!!  </strong>This mean environmental health and jobs!!!!</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Robert Clyne, I have a Ph.D. in Anthropology form Yale and I have lived in African off and on for 10 Years. I moved to Africa for the first time 50 years ago at the age of three and I am terrified by its future.  Between a shrinking global demand for commodities, automation destroying  development opportunities, and  climate change many countries will be at their tipping point.</p>
<p><font>The double revolution is using the natural synergies between diesel production and ethanol to create high profits, to clean up the environment, and to create hundreds of eco friendly entrepreneurial opportunities. </font>Africans recycling their waste can clean up their environments,  can create jobs, and can cut their fuel cost by as much as 50%.  Africans making ethanol related products from activated charcoal, to yeast, to exotic raw materials, to  spirits, to perfume, and to essential oils could make very profitable small industries which would hopefully breed other profitable small industries.   Supporting our project will create revenues for at least 50 people in the first first year.  </p>
<p><strong>What we need is pretty basic</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We need  $19K..</p>
<p>Two  6 kilowatt ethanol stills                                                               10,000</p>

<p>.                                               <strong>What happens if we do not get enough funds.</strong></p>
<p>This technology is very scalable.  As long as we can afford one distillation machine and a generator we can begin.  We can run our generators on a black diesel we developed for our ethanol distillation.  With more money we will simply open more recycling plants, cleaning up more waste, and providing more income for recyclers. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Africans must develop industries that can withstand climate change and they must develop attractive high-profit niche products they can export on the world market (the low-skill labor intensive industries that Asia used to develop economically will no longer work in today's automated world!).  Our eco friendly projects offer both environmental health and economic transformation.  </p>
<p>I have been a successful entrepreneur in Africa and recently I was awarded licenses to make diesel substitute fuel from waste oil in both Ghana and Burkina Faso.  With Alex Polinaski's proven technologies we are sure we will go to the next level and fast.  By buying one recycling machine a month in less than a year we will be keeping <strong>4000 liters of waste oil</strong> off the ground and producing a community- based diesel at about half the price of diesel at the pump.  We are already talking with partners in Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mali, and the Gambia to spread this model!</p>
<p>Our collaboration with Alex Polianski and Lubrication Specialties Inc. insure we have the technical support to make high quality spirits and diesel even under very tough conditions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have ten years living and working experience in Africa including 8 years in Nigeria.  I have worked as a consultant for Ford Foundation and I have run my own businesses.   I have already gone through the licensing and testing for my diesel substitute in Ghana and Burkina Faso.  It will be the same procedure again for ethanol.</p>
<p>The machines we use are time-proven to be super robust and to be easy to maintain and repair.  Ninety-five per cent of the raw materials we use will be available in country. The rest can be affordably air mailed.</p>
<p>No business is risk-free but with my prior business experience and connections in Ghana and Burkina  and the quality of our technology and technical support I am sure we will be able to overcome the inevitable obstacles.  Having two viable businesses helps insure adequate cashflow  during an occasional downturn.</p>

<p>Hago Energetics Inc., a startup company focused on tackling climate change from many angles, is currently working on a project designed to tackle one of the most pressing issues involved with the climate crisis: carbon dioxide. </p>
<p>Here at Hago Energetics, we have designed a direct air capture unit to pull carbon dioxide out of ambient air by attaching these units to thousands of trailers to be pulled by trucks, SUVs, and – ideally – electric vehicles. Our design will utilize the movement of the vehicle by incorporating the wind and eliminating the need for fans, thus saving on electricity and energy. The unit will use a sorbent that acts like a sponge to adsorb the carbon dioxide, separating the CO2 from the air. A concentrated product of carbon dioxide will be returned at a central station. </p>
<p>Our mission is to democratize carbon capture by scaling it down to be used by thousands of people around the nation. The world needs to be carbon neutral soon. Once we become carbon neutral, we need to become carbon negative, by removing the carbon still in the air. With technologies such as miniature direct air capture devices, Hago Energetics is transforming the way we can address global warming by reinventing large-scale technologies for individual consumer use.</p>
<p>Funding for this project will contribute to turning our concept into a reality. Therefore, we are asking you to help us do our part to create a sustainable and healthy planet for us all. If you can’t donate, please help us by spreading the word and sharing this post with the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

Here at Hago Energetics, we have designed a direct air capture unit to pull carbon dioxide out of ambient air by attaching these units to thousands of trailers to be pulled by trucks, SUVs, and – ideally – electric vehicles. Our design will utilize the movement of the vehicle by incorporating the wind and eliminating the need for fans, thus saving on electricity and energy. The unit will use a sorbent that acts like a sponge to adsorb the carbon dioxide, separating the CO2 from the air. A concentrated product of carbon dioxide will be returned at a central station. 
Our mission is to democratize carbon capture by scaling it down to be used by thousands of people around the nation. The world needs to be carbon neutral soon. Once we become carbon neutral, we need to become carbon negative, by removing the carbon still in the air. With technologies such as miniature direct air capture devices, Hago Energetics is transforming the way we can address global warming by reinventing large-scale technologies for individual consumer use.
Funding for this project will contribute to turning our concept into a reality. Therefore, we are asking you to help us do our part to create a sustainable and healthy planet for us all. If you can’t donate, please help us by spreading the word and sharing this post with the Indiegogo share tools!
Here is a link to a presentation about our design:

<p>What’s more, Qwickfone system is far more than a cell-phone. The <strong>Qwickbiz</strong> software makes micro-commerce fast and easy. In a place where there are no banks or access to money, a simple transaction over a reliable system can lift many out of poverty: Farmers can sell their produce to small villages and get paid immediately. Small shops in one village can do business in other villages - expanding their market, making more money, hiring more people, buying more goods from other suppliers who can also expand their market, hire more people, buy more equipment, get microloans and expand their businesses even more. It’s an exponential win/win for everyone.</p>
<p>Then there’s <strong>Qwickcomm</strong>: An emergency broadcast system that can save lives by providing emergency text messages to warn of impending floods, fires, epidemics or even terrorism. Being forewarned is being prepared.</p>
<p><u><strong>Qwickfone is an idea that has finally come. </strong></u></p>

<p>With Qwickfone, our goal is to install a system in <strong>every unserved and forgotten community</strong> in the world. Geography, population, and the disinterest of Big Telecom have kept people poor, unenlightened and out of touch for decades – but now there can be no more excuses.</p>
<p><u><strong>We need your support.</strong></u></p>
<p>As of the time of this campaign, we have interest from the following nations: <strong>Canada, Congo, DRC, India, Indonesia</strong><strong>, Kazahkstan, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, UK and Zambia.</strong> There is already a desire to see Qwickfone under full scale test and working in the unserved areas of these countries. To accomplish this, we need extra funds to further develop the system, manufacture bespoke equipment, install the management network and create the necessary technical and sales support infrastructure. We can do this over time, but right now, we need your help just to get us into the field in a large-scale test.</p>
<p><u><strong>How you can help.</strong></u></p>
<p>You can give money here or via our website at <strong><a href=""http://www.qwickfone.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.qwickfone.com</a></strong>. You can <strong>spread the word via social media</strong> – liking us on <i><strong>Facebook</strong></i>, following us on <i><strong>Twitter</strong></i>, getting others to look at our campaign and then spread the word again.</p>
<p><strong>We want to reward you for having faith in us.</strong></p>
<p>We believe in Qwickfone. We want to give back to you for believing in us. See our<strong> terrific PERKS</strong> to see what we have on offer – and remember, membership in the Qwickfone Community means you will not only be helping others who are less fortunate than you, it means you will be in a front row seat to see how Qwickfone revolutionises communication in the developing world!</p>

Small shops in one village can do business in other villages - expanding their market, making more money, hiring more people, buying more goods from other suppliers who can also expand their market, hire more people, buy more equipment, get microloans and expand their businesses even more. It’s an exponential win/win for everyone.
Then there’s Qwickcomm: An emergency broadcast system that can save lives by providing emergency text messages to warn of impending floods, fires, epidemics or even terrorism. Being forewarned is being prepared.
Qwickfone is an idea that has finally come. 
Qwickfone is an Anglo/Canadian organization. Based in London, we're a small but dedicated group with a focus on solving the problems that the corporate world prefers to ignore.

With Qwickfone, our goal is to install a system in every unserved and forgotten community in the world. Geography, population, and the disinterest of Big Telecom have kept people poor, unenlightened and out of touch for decades – but now there can be no more excuses.
We need your support.
As of the time of this campaign, we have interest from the following nations: Canada, Congo, DRC, India, Indonesia, Kazahkstan, Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, UK and Zambia. There is already a desire to see Qwickfone under full scale test and working in the unserved areas of these countries. To accomplish this, we need extra funds to further develop the system, manufacture bespoke equipment, install the management network and create the necessary technical and sales support infrastructure. We can do this over time, but right now, we need your help just to get us into the field in a large-scale test.
How you can help.
You can give money here or via our website at www.qwickfone.com. You can spread the word via social media – liking us on Facebook, following us on Twitter, getting others to look at our campaign and then spread the word again.
We want to reward you for having faith in us.
We believe in Qwickfone. We want to give back to you for believing in us. See our terrific PERKS to see what we have on offer – and remember, membership in the Qwickfone Community means you will not only be helping others who are less fortunate than you, it means you will be in a front row seat to see how Qwickfone revolutionises communication in the developing world!

Act NOW!
Those in need do not have the luxury of endless time. Every day that they're cut off from the world they're in danger and their quality of life is impaired. Act now and let’s do this together - bringing hope to the hopeless, making our vision come true, ending the silence for more than a billion.",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>I put my genetic research on the side line in the last three years, to focus into bringing the SharkSafe Barrier to life. I love the Ocean and the sharks with all my heart and I can’t stand thinking that they will get extinct. Not on my watch. All sharks lovers have now a real chance to make a difference with us, as raising awareness is no longer enough: we need to change the way sharks are managed. We need to do so by improving what we know about them, and by keeping them safe from shark nets, nationally and internationally.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>With this campaign I hope to get as many sharks lovers as possible behind our mission</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope to have enough funds to finish the engineering work on the deep sand anchors, and I hope to deliver the SharkSafe Barrier on all places using shark nets against their shark populations.</p>
<p>I hope we will change the way we co-exist with sharks the same way we learned to co-exist with some large land predators. In the Kruger National Park of South Africa lions are a resource for the environment and for the local tourism. They are admired by the tourists in all of their beauty, and kept separated from the urban areas with high enclosures surrounding the Park. It is my hope that we can transfer this approach to our marine predators. Because the environment needs them, and because we have the moral duty to keep them safe, if we want to protect the marine ecosystem.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What do we urgently need!</h3>
<p>For completing the engineering tests on the deep-sand anchoring system we appointed professional coastal engineers for testing the prototypes in the laboratory using a flume tank (a large aquarium simulating the waves action in which we can deploy our latest sand anchors).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>This work doesn’t come cheap, and it will cost us 80 000 USD to be completed.</strong></p>
<p>After this will be done, we will have a solid idea on how to deploy the SharkSafe Barrier on the deep sand of the South African coastline. We already obtained a research permit from the South African Department of Environmental Affairs, for 2018, to deploy our prototypes in deep sand. The at sea operation will cost additional 300 000 USD, that we hope to source in the near future, either thanks to a research grant, investors or, once again, thanks to the thousands of ocean loving people like you, reading this right now.</p>
<p>We approached a local South African company to make for us the best SharkSafe Barrier T-shirts and most amazing SharkSafe hats.</p>
<p>We decided to put our logo on wearable items, so that you can proudly show your support to our common cause. Please bear in mind that we are scientists and conservationists by trade, and we are exploring the crowdfunding world for the first time. Ever. We are super open to suggestions, and we will be really grateful to have your input on how to improve our campaign and how to make this work better together.</p>
<p>If we will reach our goal we will cover the engineering expenses for the lab-testing, and you will be able to follow our progresses, by following our news feed in the website (<a href=""http://www.sharksafesolution.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sharksafesolution.com</a>) and our Facebook page (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/Sharksafebarrier"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/Sharksafebarrier</a>).</p>

<h3>WHY DOES YOUR HELP COUNTS?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Thanks to your contribution you are going to really help us making a difference</strong>.</p>
<p>We have been working since 2011 until now, thanks to the in kind contribution and sponsorship of Shark Diving Unlimited, Innovus and the University of Stellenbosch, O’ Seas Conservation Foundation, seed funds from the Technology Innovation Agency, sponsorship form White Shark Diving Company and research grants provided by the NGO SHARKPROJECT, Taronga Zoo (Australia) and the Explorers Club. We went as far as we could with the funds provided, and managed to complete the scientific research on the sharks (you can see the list of our scientific publications here:  <a href=""https://www.sharksafesolution.com/scientific-tests/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.sharksafesolution.com/scientific-tests/</a>). We managed to finalize the design of the vertical elements of the barrier to make it look just like a forest of kelp, and had it resist the turbulent waters of the Cape of Storm in South Africa.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The deep sand anchorage system is truly our last step for making our barrier available for all kind of beaches. We are planning to bring the SharkSafe Barrier from South Africa to the rest of the world, in any place needing to stop culling sharks, with the excuse of tourism.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We realize that what we want to do is challenging, we experienced first-hand, for the last seven years, the peculiar ability the Ocean has to break things. He comes across as a really powerful toddler, who finds new way to break the most robust designs. We developed over the years a huge respect for the Ocean’s power, and we are not to underestimate the challenges this project is still going to present.</p>
<p>But, despite all of above, we believe we can do this, if we do this together. We believe we have to do this, if we care about the sharks, and we have to believe that no matter how huge the waves, we need to find a way to navigate this project forward. Too many marine creatures die already and too many families got shattered to pieces as a results of negative encounters with sharks. We have a real chance to fix this problem for good, so we just have to push forward and keep on testing until the final prototype will resist the Ocean, no matter the sea-floor composition.</p>

Sadly, we as consumers have been disguised from the likes of these issues over its colourful and flavourful treats produced by cocoa. The beautifully wrapped chocolate candies over Halloween, Easter, Christmas, and birthday cakes are the perfect cover up; not informing us if the products we consume, have been produced by children, grown in deforested areas, or costs chocolate confectioners only $0.33 to pay its farmers for the produce of each unit sold.</p><p>As demand for chocolate and cocoa products continues to skyrocket, we could only work to redefine the supply chain, and to rebalance the disequilibrium of the situation faced by smallholder famers. We want to give growers the opportunity to independently develop their own communities, and to prioritise their child’s education over working at farms.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533569606/w61uvqaip37smipwhein.jpg"" src=""""/></p><table cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" width=""100%""><tbody><tr><td><div><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Children of cocoa planters - who had never tasted chocolate prior to this.

<h3><i>Le problème</i></h3>
<p><i>La chaine de production et de commercialisation primaire des fèves de cacao n’est pas formellement organisée, ce qui exclut les producteurs d’un accès structuré au marché et par conséquent de l’accès au crédit agricole, aux intrants et aux services de base. Les transactions dans cette chaine ne sont pas tracées avec pour conséquence une capture des marges de ce marché de 100 milliards de dollars essentiellement par les intermédiaires et les industriels, ne laissant aux agriculteurs que moins de 10% du prix d’une tablette de chocolat vendue au consommateur final. Cela maintient la plupart des producteurs de cacao dans une situation de pauvreté avec un accès limité à l’eau potable, à l’électricité, aux services de soins, à l’éducation et parfois à la sécurité alimentaire. Faute de pouvoir mettre en œuvre des pratiques agricoles durables améliorant la production et la qualité du cacao, la demande mondiale croissante est à l’origine d’une déforestation croissante qui réduit les zones protégées et les forêts naturelles a ainsi que la faune sauvage. Finalement le cacao devient le vecteur de tragédies économiques et environnementales au lieu de constituer le facteur de développement qu’il devrait être.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>Notre promesse</i></h3>
<p><i>Africa Cocoa Village veut transformer la chaine de valeur du cacao en la valorisant avec les producteurs pour répondre aux attentes actuelles du consommateur et ainsi poser les bases du standard mondial des réseaux d’alimentation du futur. Ancré sur l’amélioration des conditions de vie du planteur de cacao et da famille et son articulation avec la production d’un cacao de qualité, la traçabilité des opérations le long du continuum allant de la production à la commercialisation, la régularité de l’approvisionnement, la gestion responsable des ressources naturelles, Africa Cocoa Village redéfinit le chocolat comme un instrument unique de développement, en constituant une expérience universelle enrichissant à la fois les consommateurs et les planteurs.</i></p>
<p><i>Plus sur <a href=""http://www.africacocoavillage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.africacocoavillage.com</a></i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>Comment çà marche?</i></h3>
<p><i>Africa Cocoa Village marrie le suivi physique des transactions avec l’exploitation des solutions digitales et en ouvrant ainsi la voie à l’intégration d’une transparence complète, d’interactions responsables et d’un principe d’approvisionnement honorable entre les agriculteurs, les industriels et les consommateurs. Pour cela Africa Cocoa Village a conçu une plateforme digitale exploitée sur chaque plantation pour appuyer et tracer l’activité agricole des planteurs en temps réel et établir un nouveau standard de consommation responsable.</i></p>
<p><i>Africa Cocoa Village suit et trace chaque lot de fèves de cacao avec les planteurs depuis la plantation jusqu'au site de livraison de l’acheteur final, le plus souvent un chocolatier ou confiseur, fabriquant le produit destiné au consommateur. Grâce aux indicateurs de performance alimenté par ce système, Africa Cocoa Village « dérisque » toute la chaine de valeur, protège les investissements de l’agriculteurs et donc la chaine d’approvisionnement de l’industriel avec des services d’assurance agricole contre les risques environnementaux et climatiques. Chaque parcelle de cacao est précisément géo-référencée, les itinéraires techniques améliorés suivis par les planteurs sont documentés et chaque intervention renseignée en temps réel, un réseau d’agents techniques assiste les planteurs, la logistique est optimisée sur l’ensemble de la chaine, les paiements sont sécurisés. Enfin l'identifiant unique d’Africa Cocoa Village encodé sur chaque sac de fèves permet de retracer son origine, son itinéraire et son histoire détaillés et, de manière transparente et sincère, supporte la commercialisation d’un cacao Premium.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>Notre objectif</i></h3>
<p><i>En structurant ainsi la chaine de valeur du cacao, Africa Cocoa Village vise à sécuriser les transactions entre tous les acteurs et en particulier de manière inclusive des petits producteurs de cacao. Grâce à ces interactions sécurisées et transparentes avec le marché, Africa Cocoa Village renforce les capacités du planteur à produire du cacao de qualité Premium pour lui permettre d’augmenter de 60% ses revenus à l’hectare et d’améliorer son retour sur investissement avec les fournisseurs d’intrants, les banques, les compagnies d’assurance et ses acheteurs.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>Impact attendu</i></h3>
<p><i>Africa Cocoa Village offert aussi une des dernières chances de réponse effective à l’important niveau de déforestation provoqué par la production de cacao et d’autres cultures pérennes. Son dispositif de géo-référencement explicite et granulaire des plantations permet d’identifier immédiatement les plantations établies dans les zones protégées, les forêts et les parcs nationaux. De plus, Africa Cocoa Village ouvre des perspectives claires d’amélioration des solutions de gestion de la fertilité des sols qui contribuent à améliorer le rendement du cacao et donc à stopper la déforestation en accompagnant le développement de systèmes de production enfin durables.</i></p>
<p><i>Africa Cocoa Village optimise la logistique du cacao le long de la chaine de valeur, ce qui réduit les charges opérationnelles correspondantes et par conséquent libère des marges additionnelles partagées sous forme de prime à la qualité aux planteurs. Africa Cocoa Village génère ainsi un cercle vertueux dans lequel l’investissement de toute la chaine de valeur augmente les dividendes qui sont réinvestis dans des opportunités de développement local des planteurs et de leur communauté, comme la création d’emplois pour les jeunes, l’amélioration de l’accès aux services de base comme l’eau potable, l’électricité et les services de soins. Enfin en incitant les enseignants comme les élèves à aller à l’école, Africa Cocoa Village exploite la capacité de transformation d’un marché global comme celui du cacao pour engager et porter à l’échelle le développement local des communautés rurales productrices de cacao.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>Risques et Challenges</i></h3>
<p><i>La volatilité des prix du cacao sur le marché international peut limiter l’intérêt des planteurs à continuer à produire du cacao Premium pour les acheteurs et les industriels.</i></p>
<ul><li><i>Africa Cocoa Village continuera à sécuriser les revenus des planteurs en les aidant à améliorer les rendements en cacao en généralisant l’exploitation des bonnes pratiques, et à développer l’économie de leur exploitation familiale grâce à une gestion optimisée de la diversification de leur production.</i></li></ul>
<p><i>La compétition économique à l’intérieur de la chaine de valeur du cacao peut constituer une barrière à l’approche de transparence, de traçabilité et de confiance respective que développe Africa Cocoa Village.</i></p>
<ul><li><i>En permettant au consommateur de participer activement à la construction de ce village, Africa Cocoa Village déplace le cadre de cette compétition économique pour explorer d’autres options économiques intéressantes pour les acteurs. L’adoption de ces options nécessitera l’engagement d’un important effort de marketing dont la probabilité de retour sur investissement restera forte.</i></li></ul>

Sadly, we as consumers have been disguised from the likes of these issues over its colourful and flavourful treats produced by cocoa. The beautifully wrapped chocolate candies over Halloween, Easter, Christmas, and birthday cakes are the perfect cover up; not informing us if the products we consume, have been produced by children, grown in deforested areas, or costs chocolate confectioners only $0.33 to pay its farmers for the produce of each unit sold.As demand for chocolate and cocoa products continues to skyrocket, we could only work to redefine the supply chain, and to rebalance the disequilibrium of the situation faced by smallholder famers. We want to give growers the opportunity to independently develop their own communities, and to prioritise their child’s education over working at farms.Children of cocoa planters - who had never tasted chocolate prior to this. Their parents labor to produce cocoa, but have never had the opportunity to purchase the finished product of chocolate. Low and insecure income of farmers lead to serious social and environmental problems. Farmers are unable to invest in their farms, they cut salaries, and cannot provide workers with proper working conditions, and in the worst case, result to child labor. Hoping to increase their revenues through higher output, they extend plantations into protected areas, which becomes the cost of sustainable, ecological and diversified farming.Africa Cocoa Village has been structured to provide independence to smallholder farmers, by improving the quality of their produce. Our model is to improve agricultural practices of famers with proper equipment’s, provide secure credit lines for farmers, and improve their environment with basic necessities. All of which, will help smallholder family farmers to earn a higher profit margin by producing premium quality cocoa beans. In the long run, this model becomes a reinforcement for farmers to reinvest their earnings to gain independence and freedom out of their economic situation. What makes us different?We engage field services with  our digital platform to execute this program. The platform opens uncharted development pathways of the cocoa value chain based on transparency, responsibility, and honorable sourcing. Connected with satellites, we are able to track and support agricultural activities in real time, establishing a new standard of consumption awareness.Our management team, inspecting cocoa quality at one of the villages where we provided  proper elevated drying matsAddressing challenges such like deforestation through our platform, we are able to monitor if farmers are extending their plantations into protected areas. Our on-ground team tracks on farmer’s practices, and keep them aligned with proper techniques and supports them with agricultural supplies if needed. With our mobile payment system to farmers, we practice immediate payment within 24h of releasing their cocoa bags. We have also extended the platform to track on teacher-student attendances, notifying us if children are working instead of attending classes. The OutcomeAfrica Cocoa Village guarantee’s that our cocoa beans are bagged from the individual plantation it grows from. It ensures that only matured pods are harvested, beans are carefully hand separated and placenta is removed, that fermentation and drying process are properly and safely conducted to keep the authenticity of flavour; prioritising quality over quantity.  One of our practices, is that cocoa beans are bagged directly in presence of the grower after the drying process, and tagged with an ID code. (This ID code is your log-in on our platform, that gives you information about the cocoa beans you have received).We ensure that all children from our registered plantations will receive education, by providing incentives to parents to prioritise their child’s education over labouring at farms. Through the re-investments of farmers, we will support villages by building more schools, minimizing the distances children walk to school to 3km.In addressing deforestation issues, we introduce agroforestry to growers and incentive them to engage in reforestation and revitalisation actions. Through the platform, we track on growers, and reward those who continues to participate in this practice.The program structure has been modelled in a way to reinforce smallholder farmers to upkeep and align their agricultural practices to continuously produce premium quality cocoa beans, such that their income increases to over 500%.

Le problème
La chaine de production et de commercialisation primaire des fèves de cacao n’est pas formellement organisée, ce qui exclut les producteurs d’un accès structuré au marché et par conséquent de l’accès au crédit agricole, aux intrants et aux services de base. Les transactions dans cette chaine ne sont pas tracées avec pour conséquence une capture des marges de ce marché de 100 milliards de dollars essentiellement par les intermédiaires et les industriels, ne laissant aux agriculteurs que moins de 10% du prix d’une tablette de chocolat vendue au consommateur final. Cela maintient la plupart des producteurs de cacao dans une situation de pauvreté avec un accès limité à l’eau potable, à l’électricité, aux services de soins, à l’éducation et parfois à la sécurité alimentaire. Faute de pouvoir mettre en œuvre des pratiques agricoles durables améliorant la production et la qualité du cacao, la demande mondiale croissante est à l’origine d’une déforestation croissante qui réduit les zones protégées et les forêts naturelles a ainsi que la faune sauvage. Finalement le cacao devient le vecteur de tragédies économiques et environnementales au lieu de constituer le facteur de développement qu’il devrait être.
 
Notre promesse
Africa Cocoa Village veut transformer la chaine de valeur du cacao en la valorisant avec les producteurs pour répondre aux attentes actuelles du consommateur et ainsi poser les bases du standard mondial des réseaux d’alimentation du futur. Ancré sur l’amélioration des conditions de vie du planteur de cacao et da famille et son articulation avec la production d’un cacao de qualité, la traçabilité des opérations le long du continuum allant de la production à la commercialisation, la régularité de l’approvisionnement, la gestion responsable des ressources naturelles, Africa Cocoa Village redéfinit le chocolat comme un instrument unique de développement, en constituant une expérience universelle enrichissant à la fois les consommateurs et les planteurs.

Comment çà marche?
Africa Cocoa Village marrie le suivi physique des transactions avec l’exploitation des solutions digitales et en ouvrant ainsi la voie à l’intégration d’une transparence complète, d’interactions responsables et d’un principe d’approvisionnement honorable entre les agriculteurs, les industriels et les consommateurs. Pour cela Africa Cocoa Village a conçu une plateforme digitale exploitée sur chaque plantation pour appuyer et tracer l’activité agricole des planteurs en temps réel et établir un nouveau standard de consommation responsable.
Africa Cocoa Village suit et trace chaque lot de fèves de cacao avec les planteurs depuis la plantation jusqu'au site de livraison de l’acheteur final, le plus souvent un chocolatier ou confiseur, fabriquant le produit destiné au consommateur. Grâce aux indicateurs de performance alimenté par ce système, Africa Cocoa Village « dérisque » toute la chaine de valeur, protège les investissements de l’agriculteurs et donc la chaine d’approvisionnement de l’industriel avec des services d’assurance agricole contre les risques environnementaux et climatiques. Chaque parcelle de cacao est précisément géo-référencée, les itinéraires techniques améliorés suivis par les planteurs sont documentés et chaque intervention renseignée en temps réel, un réseau d’agents techniques assiste les planteurs, la logistique est optimisée sur l’ensemble de la chaine, les paiements sont sécurisés. Enfin l'identifiant unique d’Africa Cocoa Village encodé sur chaque sac de fèves permet de retracer son origine, son itinéraire et son histoire détaillés et, de manière transparente et sincère, supporte la commercialisation d’un cacao Premium.
 
Notre objectif
En structurant ainsi la chaine de valeur du cacao, Africa Cocoa Village vise à sécuriser les transactions entre tous les acteurs et en particulier de manière inclusive des petits producteurs de cacao. Grâce à ces interactions sécurisées et transparentes avec le marché, Africa Cocoa Village renforce les capacités du planteur à produire du cacao de qualité Premium pour lui permettre d’augmenter de 60% ses revenus à l’hectare et d’améliorer son retour sur investissement avec les fournisseurs d’intrants, les banques, les compagnies d’assurance et ses acheteurs.
 
Impact attendu
Africa Cocoa Village offert aussi une des dernières chances de réponse effective à l’important niveau de déforestation provoqué par la production de cacao et d’autres cultures pérennes. Son dispositif de géo-référencement explicite et granulaire des plantations permet d’identifier immédiatement les plantations établies dans les zones protégées, les forêts et les parcs nationaux. De plus, Africa Cocoa Village ouvre des perspectives claires d’amélioration des solutions de gestion de la fertilité des sols qui contribuent à améliorer le rendement du cacao et donc à stopper la déforestation en accompagnant le développement de systèmes de production enfin durables.
Africa Cocoa Village optimise la logistique du cacao le long de la chaine de valeur, ce qui réduit les charges opérationnelles correspondantes et par conséquent libère des marges additionnelles partagées sous forme de prime à la qualité aux planteurs. Africa Cocoa Village génère ainsi un cercle vertueux dans lequel l’investissement de toute la chaine de valeur augmente les dividendes qui sont réinvestis dans des opportunités de développement local des planteurs et de leur communauté, comme la création d’emplois pour les jeunes, l’amélioration de l’accès aux services de base comme l’eau potable, l’électricité et les services de soins. Enfin en incitant les enseignants comme les élèves à aller à l’école, Africa Cocoa Village exploite la capacité de transformation d’un marché global comme celui du cacao pour engager et porter à l’échelle le développement local des communautés rurales productrices de cacao.
 
Risques et Challenges
La volatilité des prix du cacao sur le marché international peut limiter l’intérêt des planteurs à continuer à produire du cacao Premium pour les acheteurs et les industriels.
Africa Cocoa Village continuera à sécuriser les revenus des planteurs en les aidant à améliorer les rendements en cacao en généralisant l’exploitation des bonnes pratiques, et à développer l’économie de leur exploitation familiale grâce à une gestion optimisée de la diversification de leur production.
La compétition économique à l’intérieur de la chaine de valeur du cacao peut constituer une barrière à l’approche de transparence, de traçabilité et de confiance respective que développe Africa Cocoa Village.
En permettant au consommateur de participer activement à la construction de ce village, Africa Cocoa Village déplace le cadre de cette compétition économique pour explorer d’autres options économiques intéressantes pour les acteurs. L’adoption de ces options nécessitera l’engagement d’un important effort de marketing dont la probabilité de retour sur investissement restera forte.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Fran Pickering, I am the life partner of Nigel Bamford, inventor of Bamford's Waterblade and now: 'Waterblade Easy'. We are ordinary people, concerned about our planet and what the future might look like.</p>
<p>Our future and that of all our children, rests on the choices make today. Nigel has dedicated all of his time for the past 5 years into developing his energy and water saving device, that will work with many standard mixer taps. A simple but brilliant idea that in real terms, saves the user over 60% on water and water heating for their tap. Having won many awards and had a good deal of success with Mark 1, we have creatively used all the feed back, to  improve on our product. Firstly, we have made it easy for anyone to install and effective in more diverse situations.We believe that the latest model, when brought to market, has the potential to impact water usage and energy consumption around the world. </p>
<p>We are asking for your support in realising that potential.</p>
<p>For this to happen, we will need financial support to get high volume manufacturing, individual country accreditation, IP protection and a marketing campaign that will let the world know about the Waterblade ""Easy"". In return, we promise a clean supply chain, a quality  controlled, durable product that is affordable and environmentally friendly. Not to forget the warm feeling of knowing you are helping to change the world for the better. We are proud to be part of the new ""ethical business revolution"". </p>

<p><strong>How confident are we that we can deliver?</strong> </p>
<p>We have already successfully brought the award winning Waterblade to market, and sold 10,000 units in the UK and abroad. Our UK manufacturer is Quality assured (ISO 9001), and we have a fully tested, priced and working prototype for this new model. The answer is <u>Very</u> <u>Confident!</u></p>
<p><strong>Why are we giving to Wateraid?</strong></p>
<p>Here at Waterblade we really want to be part of the solution to water scarcity issues globally and we really like the work Wateraid do in bringing water supply to highly impoverished areas around the world..</p>
<p><strong>Why are we giving to Brighton Permaculture Trust?</strong></p>
<p>Because we also believe in local action as part of the big picture. This is local to us, with multiple yields: Their ""Sussex Orchard planting Project"" for communities, gives healthy, nutritious fruit, free to the public for generations to come, while engaging and growing those communities in the here and now.

</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The way we see it at Waterblade, in order to soften the now inevitable effects of climate change, we must effect change in some of our western practices, such as our thinking in a disposable, throw away manner. People love to be clean and its about how we go about things; no more the out of sight, out of mind, more systems thinking  like we are beginning to do with global supply chains and anti slavery. We the public are the consumer, so let us embrace this responsibility with real power and intention to do things better. Celebrate innovation and scientific breakthroughs, but question the hows and the whys of what we do. Each person is a member of the global economy and has something to say and choices to make about it. This includes, what kind of world  we want to create from here. A world where we are fighting wars over water, or one where water is treated with respect as a  resource for all? </li>
<li>We think Waterblade helps us to do that, while taking the pain out of cutting back and giving satisfaction in savings at the same time.</li>
<li>We launched our original Waterblade a year and a half ago and have been steadily building relationships across many business sectors. we have found that the limitations of the first product meant it was ideal for a business, but lacked features ideal for the domestic user. So while we continue to promote Bamford's Waterblade, we have been beavering away to create ""the Easy Fit"" version which has integrated optimised flow, thus doing away with any faffing under the sink or a need to have isolation valves. From here on in, it's just screw in and go! No Plumber Required!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One risk is not keeping up momentum, (which is why we really need people to like and share our campaign) .We have been committed to this for some years now, we know we are committed to continue.</p>
<p>Keeping the costs down around distribution so that it remains affordable. In order to do this, We are carefully selecting who and how the Waterblade will be distributed in different countries/ regions of the world. </p>
<p>Another risk are Copycats. In these modern times of manufacturing it is virtually impossible to stop  fakes and copying and sadly, sometimes rip offs can destroy the original product.</p>
<p>To help us with this issue, we have a strong focus on building a branded product that is second to none in performance and reliability.  We have also invested heavily in patents and other intellectual property protections internationally.</p>
<p>We want you to know,  that what we bring to the table is embedded in quality, free from slavery , reliable and environmentally sustainable, from production to installation, not because that's fashionable, but because as individuals, we believe it is the only way to create a better world.</p>

One risk is not keeping up momentum, (which is why we really need people to like and share our campaign) .We have been committed to this for some years now, we know we are committed to continue.
Keeping the costs down around distribution so that it remains affordable. In order to do this, We are carefully selecting who and how the Waterblade will be distributed in different countries/ regions of the world. 
Another risk are Copycats. In these modern times of manufacturing it is virtually impossible to stop  fakes and copying and sadly, sometimes rip offs can destroy the original product.
To help us with this issue, we have a strong focus on building a branded product that is second to none in performance and reliability.  We have also invested heavily in patents and other intellectual property protections internationally.
We want you to know,  that what we bring to the table is embedded in quality, free from slavery , reliable and environmentally sustainable, from production to installation, not because that's fashionable, but because as individuals, we believe it is the only way to create a better world.

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>We at ArganOne believe people will appreciate having zero energy bills, or get paid for generating more energy than they use at our houses. Solar and wind power are also clean, zero emissions power sources.</p>
<p>This is just the start! We are also looking to expand beyond Florida.</p>
<h3>Our Background</h3>
<p>With our combined experience of more than 20 years in the engineering and restaurant process management fields, we know we can succeed. We believe strongly in ethical principles, so you can be assured that the money you contribute will be used wisely.</p>
<p>We have also established hiring and employee management processes that we think new employees will love. The health, safety and overall well-being of our employees are very important to us.</p>
</div>
<h3>Our Funding Needs</h3>
<p>We are looking for $15,000,000 because we'd like to purchase and lease as well as resell at least 40 houses in Florida within the next year. All of them will be upgraded to use 100% solar and wind power along with other technologies such as energy storage and EV (electric vehicle) charging stations. The subsequent money from both leasing a percentage of the homes and selling the remaining portion will help fund future home purchases. If you consider the value of thousands of other companies in the US and beyond, the amount we are asking for is relatively small in comparison.</p>
<p>In addition to direct contributions of any amount, you also have the option of purchasing one or more of the items or discount packages we have available. See more to the right.</p>
<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
<p>Some of the challenges we face are:</p>
<p>1. Making sure each home we purchase fits our vision, as we want our customers to enjoy living in our houses and of course benefit from zero energy bills (or get paid for generating energy).</p>
<p>2. Coordinating simultaneous projects for the solar and wind systems as well as other home upgrades for multiple homes.</p>
<p>3. Work with suppliers and installers such as Tesla, Plugless Power and others to get the projects completed correctly and within a reasonable amount of time. We will use only quality materials and our methods will follow best practices.</p>
<p>4. Expansion outside of Florida, while very exciting, also comes with a significant amount of work required both in hiring new people for the new regions and working with new providers, including installers.</p>
<p>We know we can do all these things and more with your help. Now, let's continue the journey!</p>

Increasingly intense storms are dumping incredible amounts of rainfall in mountains that race to lowlands, causing rivers to swell beyond their banks. In every corner of the country, floods are a threat. And having protection against rising waters is critical. In the US 5.6 million families have flood insurance yet almost 25 million people live in flood-prone areas. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497486088/cphmfuflkhmnat8m2vyf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Flood insurance is getting more expensive every year and harder and harder to find.

Diluvium Dry also does not require special disposal after floodwaters recede. It can be rolled up and put away in a shed or other small space until it is needed again.

With his years of experience he designed Diluvium Dry as a better solution than the obsolete sandbags and other existing flood protection systems. As a flood expert he wanted to create something more effective and less polluting than sandbags and something that doesn’t require heavy equipment to erect a semi-permanent structure to hold back a flood.</p><p>After doing a number of flood fights himself he confirmed that most floods don’t rise rapidly.

<i style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">About me:</i><br/>
</h2><p>Hello! <br/>I am a 24 year old inventor/entrepreneur of all kinds of electronic devices! Thus far it has been a passionate hobby of mine to create devices for my family, friends, and myself. Recently I have discovered some exciting new information regarding the creation of graphene by using graphite powder and a ""Lightscribe"" cd burner. Graphene is a material that has been theorized to exist for decades. Just recently however, it was discovered that it can quite easily be created with modern means. Please research this amazing new material. <br/><br/>When speaking of graphene it has been held up to the same level as the creation of bronze and the bronze era that soon followed. Today we are at the forefront of the Graphene era! Recent tests have showed that a battery the size of a credit card (actually a super-capacitor that would replace a battery) can produce 5v and approximately 2.5Milli Amp Hours of power!!! The materials used to create the super-capacitor are all completely eco friendly and biodegradable. Perhaps the most exciting aspect of  super-capacitors is the amount of time it takes to actually charge them. In fact, you can charge a small graphene super-capacitor for about 2 seconds, and it will run a 1.5volt LED for about 5min. Imagine if you scaled that up 100 times! <br/><br/>Now, what I plan to do is: Use my knowledge of electronic devices/batteries/capacitors/ect... and begin to produce flexible, multi-celled super-capacitors. They will produce a wide range of voltages and Milli Amp Hour ratings(Farads, Wattage, ect...) and have a wide range of applications. First of all, I will be placing a 12v version in my own personal quad copter. It will replace my 5000MAH LiPo battery, that weighs over a kilogram, with a super-capacitor that weighs &lt; 500g. Not only is it an astoundingly light material, the MAH rating will be almost double that of the LiPo! This replacement will charge in less than a 1/4 of the time!! To top it all off graphene is made up of almost purely carbon, which is one of the most abundant and replenish able elements in the WORLD. On a large scale the abundance of carbon will make these products extremely cheap for the consumer. <br/><br/>Later, I would like to create a small stitchable/flexible super-capacitor for use in luminescent clothing. Perhaps an excellent application would be a jacket that begins to glow when it's dark. A child could wear this jacket for saftey outside at night. The jacket could also contain graphene solar cells (also stitchable) and recharge the super-capacitor during daily use. This application could be applied to any article of clothing. <br/><br/>Right now I have most of the equipment needed to get started. I have 2 ""Lightscribe"" burners on their way along with a couple ultrasonic devices needed to create the solution (Aqueous Graphite solution). Please look into this information, even if you have no interest in electronics the applications of Graphene is truly astounding (Ex: Tensile strength of pure graphene thread is 10x that of Kevlar, and can also conduct electricity better than copper) . What I would like to get is an oscilliscope and pure graphene powder. The oscilliscope is crucial for testing purposes. The powder I can supplement for now by crushing, grinding and blending substances that contain graphite. I would love to start producing green and efficient battery replacement kits for anyone who needs them. If there is a specific type/shape/power output/capacity you are looking for just let me know. <br/><br/>Ideally I would be able to patent some of these devices but the cost is quite substantial so in the meantime I will just focus on experimentation and idividual needs. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading!</p></div>","Graphene Super-CapacitorsAn Effiecent Alternative to BatteriesSmaller Lighter More Storage FlexibleWhat is this?- A green alternative to modern day batteries that could potentially be tossed into your compost pile when they become unusable. - Technically these devices are super-capacitors. Similar to the function of a battery but all of the energy stored can be replaced and removed very quickly. -These super-capacitors are very light weight, have a great power density (meaning they store a lot of energy in a small space) and best of all they are flexible. - The main electronic components are made purely of carbon, one of the most abundant elements in the world. What is my goal?- I want to research and develop a range of battery replacements, that when thrown away are of no harm to the environment.  These replacements will have a wide range of uses. A few that come to mind include: Hearing aids, watches, toys, cellphones, RC vehicles, vehicle batteries, electrically powered clothing, wearable electronic devices, ect... - Short term: I want to produce a wide range of super-capacitor samples made from a variety of methods to identify the best possible combination of materials that contribute to the best result (In other words, hold the most energy in the smallest package). 
How will this replace batteries?
- Current batteries have to be taken to special recycling plants to dispose of them properly. Most batteries are just thrown into the trash and left to harm the planet while rotting away in landfills. The major components of these batteries can be tossed into a compost heap and would cause no harm to the environment. - The fundamental concept of any capacitor is that it can be charged very quickly, this means that a super-capacitor could be charged in a fraction of the current time required by most modern day batteries and achieve the same power output. 
What do I need?
- Your support! If you are reading this please share the news about this great material and the ways I plan to use it. Every little bit helps and people like you who want to make our planet a beter place to live is how technologies like this become a reality. - An oscilloscope: Used to test a wide range of electronic devices.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>How soon will swarm traps ship?</h3>
<p>Retail and fully assembled units are <u>NOW</u> shipping!</p>
<h3>Are honey bees included?</h3>
<p>No, they are not.</p>
<p>That would defeat the purpose of the product, right?  All perks involving the trap will contain what you need to catch local, healthy honey bee swarms, leading to a cheaper alternative to bee packages.</p>
<h3>Why is my swarm trap a different color?</h3>
<p>As we are continually improving our product, the color and texture of your refuBees Swarm Trap™ may vary slightly from the pictures and videos online.  Think of it as a ""2nd gen"" purchase.</p>
<h3>When is swarm season in my area?</h3>
<p>It varies by your location.</p>
<p>We'll give you the answer a college professor gave us as we researched the product early on...</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.hummingbirds.net/map.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Ruby-throated Hummingbird</a></strong></p>
<p>Because this hummingbird has zero body fat, it requires the nectar flow to begin in an area before it can migrate north.  What does this mean in relation to honey bees?  They'll start foraging once sightings of the ruby-throated hummingbirds start regularly in your area.</p>
<p>Swarm season is generally delayed a week or two after this, but keep a close eye on the map, around then it is a good idea to have your trap ready if not hang and bait it.  (Other types of bees, like bumble and mason, will begin to forage before honey bees, another indicator swarm season is approaching.)</p>
<p>(Note: If this particular hummingbird <u>does</u> <u>not</u> migrate to your area, consult with a local beekeeper.  He or she should be able to give you info about swarm season for your region.)</p>
<h3>How often should I bait the swarm trap?</h3>
<p>Every 7 to 10 days <u>AND</u> right after an extended period of rain.  Not only does the rain wash some of the swarm lure off the trap, after a good rain is also prime time to catch a swarm.</p>
<p>Remember not to overdo it (or you might run out of swarm lure), and use your cotton swab to apply the lure around the entrance and as much inside the trap as possible.</p>
<h3>Hooray!  I caught a swarm, now what?</h3>
<p>First, make sure it's a swarm and not just scouts.  Easiest way to tell is to check the trap around sundown, because scouting activity will drop off with the decrease in temperature.  If you can see (or hear) the bees inside chances are you've got them.</p>
<p>Second (and because you're sure), congratulations.  It feels good, doesn't it?</p>
<p>(<i>Remember not to lose track of time!  It's easy to get caught up watching the bees come and go from the entrance, or walk your property locating the current hot spot they're foraging.</i>)</p>
<p>Now it's time to reach out to a local beekeeper.  If you don't know any, and turned up zero results via friends and family, a localized search on the internet for ""swarm removal"" should get you what you need.</p>
<p>Explain you have the honey bees in a swarm trap with medium frames, and make sure to be available to the beekeeper during the early morning or late evening hours.  This ensures most of the bees are inside the trap, and we don't waste good honey bees!</p>
<p>Also please explain you'd like the trap back once the beekeeper has taken the 24 hours or so before transferring the bees into the new hive.</p>
<p>(Transferring the swarm into the hive too early could result in part or all of the colony absconding to the trap's original location.)</p>
<h3>How long does swarm season last?</h3>
<p>Not long enough!</p>
<p>For Ohio, where we're located, it starts mid to late spring and runs (maybe) until the end of June depending on the weather.</p>
<p>Although it's possible to occasionally catch a ""summer swarm"" your best bet is in the spring.</p>
<h3>Any additional tips to catch a swarm?</h3>
<p>Along with the swarm lure, it's a good idea to provide the honeybees with a water source.  Bees require water for everything from nutrition to regulating the temperature in the hive.</p>
<p>A water source can be natural like a nearby stream or pond, or man-made like a shallow birdbath or a simple cup of water refilled regularly.</p>
<p>Another little trick we use is to make a simple sugar solution in a spray bottle.  Before reapplying the swarm lure we'll spray sugar water just inside the entrance to the trap a few times and wait a few minutes before swabbing the entrance with the swarm lure.</p>
<p>By doing this, the bees are attracted to the lure, but grab a quick bite as they drink the simulated nectar.  Bribing the scout bees isn't a crime in this instance.</p>
<h3>How many traps should I hang on my property?</h3>
<p>It might go against our corporate self interest, but being truthful (and wanting every supporter to be as successful as possible), the fewer options the better.</p>
<p>If you're on an acre or less, one trap (maybe two tops) will work.</p>
<p>The issue is the more traps you hang and bait regularly, the more choices the scouts have.  This may seem like a good idea, but it actually backfires, because an overwhelming majority of scouts is needed to agree on a single location before the swarm will settle for good.</p>
<p>Too many choices will confuse and divide them.</p>
<h3>Where should I hang the trap?</h3>
<p>Near the edge of your property and approximately 6 feet high.  This isn't so much for the bees as it is for your human friends and family.</p>
<p>Kids especially may be ""too interested"" in the trap which could lead to a variety of problems.  It's also a good idea to discuss the product with your neighbor so they're aware, and take into account any feedback they may provide, specifically allergies.</p>
<p><strong><u>CAUTION</u></strong>: Remember honey bees are live creatures and can sting!  It's <u>strongly</u> <u>suggested</u> you observe them from a distance and let an <u>experienced</u> beekeeper remove the swarm once it's settled.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517969704/b8qhlx7xr4ktqztxt5gn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Our journey...</h3>
<p>After discussing the plight of pollinators around the world with my sister, and the work she was doing with the staff at the Cincinnati Zoo for her Master's degree, it was my responsibility to help.  Like most of us though, I didn't want to wear the whole suit and wasn't allowed to keep bee hives in my subdivision.</p>
<p>What we needed was a ""hang it and forget it"" style hive, that was easy for any and all homeowners that wanted to help.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, hives have to be maintained and monitored, so the idea evolved into a swarm trap.</p>
<p>What started as a crude drawing morphed into a 3D model (thanks to a college buddy), then a 3D printed prototype that worked, and finally a plastic injected part.</p>
<p>We did the ground work, now it's your turn to join in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Funding Needs and Perks</h3>
<p>Leveraging our house to purchase a plastic injection tool, we're turning to the Indiegogo community to generate sales of our product in order to pay that back in addition to raising the costs of initial inventory.</p>
<p>When you purchase the $50 retail perk and above, you're purchasing the actual product <u>not</u> a concept.  It's not donating to the idea of helping honey bees in your area, it's a tangible good you'll assemble and hang with your own hands.</p>
<p>For a $50 backing you get the opportunity to observe local swarms scout and then possibly settle on your property, watching as they forage the early spring blossoms.  The sense of accomplishment that comes from catching your first swarm is contagious, and why we went from ""We'll never wear a bee suit"" to operating several hives on nearby farms.</p>
<p>Once you have a swarm, it's then that you can begin to build a relationship with a local beekeeper, who will be more than willing to come and retrieve the bees from you and talk your ear off over what they do.  Some may be so excited they'll give you honey and/or wax from their apiary as a ""thank you.""</p>
<p>One thing we pride ourselves on is our parts are manufactured in the USA, and for the most part Ohio MADE, meaning they're produced, sourced, assembled, and packaged in the state of Ohio.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517971579/atme0e0ohudbkod2ita2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>A problem worth solving.</h3>
</div><div>
<p>You'll be taking a small step towards improving the environment.  If that doesn't interest you consider that honey bees play a crucial role in the production of the food we eat.</p>
<p>Honeybees, and other pollinators, are essential to agriculture in not just the US, but globally. Unfortunately beekeepers are experiencing increased losses of colonies, particularly after the winter months.</p>
<p>With honeybees dying and/or absconding, beekeepers need to maintain full hives to market and sell their honey, wax, etc. Currently they have three options, buy packages of bees, use current swarm traps on the market, or retrofit old hive boxes and hope they can lure bees into it.</p>
<p>Our refuBees Swarm Trap™ allows you to help beekeepers by providing them local, healthy honey bees in a product that's easy to transfer without losing any of the bees' hard work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the downside?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately there's no guarantee you'll catch a swarm.</p>
<p>Like we mention in our video, honey bees are fickle creatures, and it is somewhat of a gamble.</p>
<p>Having said that, please review the tips we include in our <strong>FAQ</strong> above to tilt the odds in your favor, and remember to have patience.  If you've got scouts checking out the trap you're in good shape, and remember to reapply the swarm lure to the entrance every 7 to 10 days.</p>
<p><strong><u>CAUTION</u></strong>: Remember honey bees are live creatures and can sting!  It's <u>strongly</u> <u>suggested</u> you observe from a distance and let a local, <u>experienced</u> beekeeper remove the swarm once it's settled.</p>

(Remember not to lose track of time!  It's easy to get caught up watching the bees come and go from the entrance, or walk your property locating the current hot spot they're foraging.)
Now it's time to reach out to a local beekeeper.  If you don't know any, and turned up zero results via friends and family, a localized search on the internet for ""swarm removal"" should get you what you need.
Explain you have the honey bees in a swarm trap with medium frames, and make sure to be available to the beekeeper during the early morning or late evening hours.  This ensures most of the bees are inside the trap, and we don't waste good honey bees!
Also please explain you'd like the trap back once the beekeeper has taken the 24 hours or so before transferring the bees into the new hive.
(Transferring the swarm into the hive too early could result in part or all of the colony absconding to the trap's original location.)
How long does swarm season last?
Not long enough!
For Ohio, where we're located, it starts mid to late spring and runs (maybe) until the end of June depending on the weather.
Although it's possible to occasionally catch a ""summer swarm"" your best bet is in the spring.
Any additional tips to catch a swarm?
Along with the swarm lure, it's a good idea to provide the honeybees with a water source.  Bees require water for everything from nutrition to regulating the temperature in the hive.
A water source can be natural like a nearby stream or pond, or man-made like a shallow birdbath or a simple cup of water refilled regularly.
Another little trick we use is to make a simple sugar solution in a spray bottle.  Before reapplying the swarm lure we'll spray sugar water just inside the entrance to the trap a few times and wait a few minutes before swabbing the entrance with the swarm lure.
By doing this, the bees are attracted to the lure, but grab a quick bite as they drink the simulated nectar.  Bribing the scout bees isn't a crime in this instance.
How many traps should I hang on my property?
It might go against our corporate self interest, but being truthful (and wanting every supporter to be as successful as possible), the fewer options the better.
If you're on an acre or less, one trap (maybe two tops) will work.
The issue is the more traps you hang and bait regularly, the more choices the scouts have.  This may seem like a good idea, but it actually backfires, because an overwhelming majority of scouts is needed to agree on a single location before the swarm will settle for good.
Too many choices will confuse and divide them.
Where should I hang the trap?
Near the edge of your property and approximately 6 feet high.  This isn't so much for the bees as it is for your human friends and family.
Kids especially may be ""too interested"" in the trap which could lead to a variety of problems.  It's also a good idea to discuss the product with your neighbor so they're aware, and take into account any feedback they may provide, specifically allergies.
CAUTION: Remember honey bees are live creatures and can sting!  It's strongly suggested you observe them from a distance and let an experienced beekeeper remove the swarm once it's settled.

Our journey...
After discussing the plight of pollinators around the world with my sister, and the work she was doing with the staff at the Cincinnati Zoo for her Master's degree, it was my responsibility to help.  Like most of us though, I didn't want to wear the whole suit and wasn't allowed to keep bee hives in my subdivision.
What we needed was a ""hang it and forget it"" style hive, that was easy for any and all homeowners that wanted to help.
Unfortunately, hives have to be maintained and monitored, so the idea evolved into a swarm trap.
What started as a crude drawing morphed into a 3D model (thanks to a college buddy), then a 3D printed prototype that worked, and finally a plastic injected part.
We did the ground work, now it's your turn to join in.

Funding Needs and Perks
Leveraging our house to purchase a plastic injection tool, we're turning to the Indiegogo community to generate sales of our product in order to pay that back in addition to raising the costs of initial inventory.
When you purchase the $50 retail perk and above, you're purchasing the actual product not a concept.  It's not donating to the idea of helping honey bees in your area, it's a tangible good you'll assemble and hang with your own hands.
For a $50 backing you get the opportunity to observe local swarms scout and then possibly settle on your property, watching as they forage the early spring blossoms.  The sense of accomplishment that comes from catching your first swarm is contagious, and why we went from ""We'll never wear a bee suit"" to operating several hives on nearby farms.
Once you have a swarm, it's then that you can begin to build a relationship with a local beekeeper, who will be more than willing to come and retrieve the bees from you and talk your ear off over what they do.  Some may be so excited they'll give you honey and/or wax from their apiary as a ""thank you.""
One thing we pride ourselves on is our parts are manufactured in the USA, and for the most part Ohio MADE, meaning they're produced, sourced, assembled, and packaged in the state of Ohio.

A problem worth solving.

You'll be taking a small step towards improving the environment.  If that doesn't interest you consider that honey bees play a crucial role in the production of the food we eat.
Honeybees, and other pollinators, are essential to agriculture in not just the US, but globally. Unfortunately beekeepers are experiencing increased losses of colonies, particularly after the winter months.
With honeybees dying and/or absconding, beekeepers need to maintain full hives to market and sell their honey, wax, etc. Currently they have three options, buy packages of bees, use current swarm traps on the market, or retrofit old hive boxes and hope they can lure bees into it.
Our refuBees Swarm Trap™ allows you to help beekeepers by providing them local, healthy honey bees in a product that's easy to transfer without losing any of the bees' hard work.

What's the downside?
Unfortunately there's no guarantee you'll catch a swarm.
Like we mention in our video, honey bees are fickle creatures, and it is somewhat of a gamble.
Having said that, please review the tips we include in our FAQ above to tilt the odds in your favor, and remember to have patience.  If you've got scouts checking out the trap you're in good shape, and remember to reapply the swarm lure to the entrance every 7 to 10 days.
CAUTION: Remember honey bees are live creatures and can sting!  It's strongly suggested you observe from a distance and let a local, experienced beekeeper remove the swarm once it's settled.

<h2><strong>A unique experience</strong></h2>
<p>Our company DIRISOLAR SAS wants to offer an other way to fly, a unique experience that allows to discover or rediscover the most beautiful places in the world. The innovations patented in the US and Europe grant an availability of the airship like never before at an affordable price around € 70 or $ 80 per person for a thirty minutes flight.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590586459/tzmniygxkrzwybphn0gj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Dirisolar flying over Bryce Canyon</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our company designs since 2013 the Dirisolar, a new generation airship for four passengers and one pilot that solves technological, ecological and economical challenges bounded to airships. The Dirisolar is designed to ensure the safety of the passengers and to fulfill the eco-tourism expectations. The whole airship is powered up by solar panels offering carbon free flights. The electric motors propel the airship in silence with only 47 db (equivalent to a quiet office) which allows an experience in harmony with nature. Moreover in this perspective 90% of the airship's components are recyclable and the means of production will be controlled to limit the carbon footprint. </p>

<p>61% of people already questioned are willing to experience it, are you ?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why fund us ?</strong></h2>
<p>Nowadays, climate change and the energy transition has become a global social issue. More and more people are protesting and asking their government, around the world, to act on it.</p>
<p>Dirisolar has the ambition to develop a safe and environmentally friendly aerial mobility device. We invite you to join our adventure by helping us go from virtual prototyping to reality by building our first full scale demonstrator.</p>
<p>The company was founded 10 years ago by Philippe Tixier, an aeronautic engineer from Sup Aéro with a great industrial experience in major french companies. Dirisolar's research and development department is located in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. This department is run by five engineers and supported by experts and special advisors.</p>
<p>Dirisolar, on its own funds with € 1.2 million from twenty-eight individual shareholders, invested € 2.5 million in feasibility study, design, simulations, virtual prototyping, test bench, flying model and specialists' advice.</p>
<p>The next step is the construction of a full scale demonstrator to validate all of our innovations.  EASA certification for a commercial use will come in a second time. The first experimental flight will occur in eighteen months and requires an amount of € 5.25 million.</p>
<p>The first commercial flight will occur in three years and requires an additional amount of € 4.7 million which will cover all the tests to obtain the said certification, the means to launch the production of the serial model and to put the Dirisolar in service. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution up to the € 1 million flexible goal will allow us to build the hangar for the airship's assembly and to realize structural and electrical tests which are significant steps for the project. The additional funds needed to fulfill the project will be shared between crowdfunding, new shareholders, industrial groups and public funding. We are at the present time in close negotiation with a public administration.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The short term goal is the construction of the demonstrator in France near the headquarters that will validate all the innovations and performances of the Dirisolar.</p>
<p>The long term goal for Dirisolar is to be an airship designer and builder with a few operating sites while renting and selling the Dirisolar to local operators in order to offer the Dirisolar flight experience to the whole world.</p>

<p>Airships are part of the lighter-than-air (LTA) family in the aircraft taxonomy. Unlike heavier-than-air (HTA), LTA does not require energy to stay in the air. The lift is generated by a lifting gas according to Archimedes' principle.</p>                           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/WRRi4WgEGG5SzTwMjJ/giphy.gif"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p>The Dirisolar will use helium which is a stable and flame-proof gas that can lift approximately one kilogram per cubic meter.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>But why have airships disappeared from our sky?</h3>
<p>Airships have had a golden age in the early 1900s.

</div></div>","A unique experience
Our company DIRISOLAR SAS wants to offer an other way to fly, a unique experience that allows to discover or rediscover the most beautiful places in the world. The innovations patented in the US and Europe grant an availability of the airship like never before at an affordable price around € 70 or $ 80 per person for a thirty minutes flight.
 

The Dirisolar flying over Bryce Canyon
 
Our company designs since 2013 the Dirisolar, a new generation airship for four passengers and one pilot that solves technological, ecological and economical challenges bounded to airships. The Dirisolar is designed to ensure the safety of the passengers and to fulfill the eco-tourism expectations. The whole airship is powered up by solar panels offering carbon free flights. The electric motors propel the airship in silence with only 47 db (equivalent to a quiet office) which allows an experience in harmony with nature. Moreover in this perspective 90% of the airship's components are recyclable and the means of production will be controlled to limit the carbon footprint.

61% of people already questioned are willing to experience it, are you ?
 
Why fund us ?
Nowadays, climate change and the energy transition has become a global social issue. More and more people are protesting and asking their government, around the world, to act on it.
Dirisolar has the ambition to develop a safe and environmentally friendly aerial mobility device. We invite you to join our adventure by helping us go from virtual prototyping to reality by building our first full scale demonstrator.
The company was founded 10 years ago by Philippe Tixier, an aeronautic engineer from Sup Aéro with a great industrial experience in major french companies. Dirisolar's research and development department is located in Boulogne-Billancourt, France. This department is run by five engineers and supported by experts and special advisors.
Dirisolar, on its own funds with € 1.2 million from twenty-eight individual shareholders, invested € 2.5 million in feasibility study, design, simulations, virtual prototyping, test bench, flying model and specialists' advice.
The next step is the construction of a full scale demonstrator to validate all of our innovations.  EASA certification for a commercial use will come in a second time. The first experimental flight will occur in eighteen months and requires an amount of € 5.25 million.
The first commercial flight will occur in three years and requires an additional amount of € 4.7 million which will cover all the tests to obtain the said certification, the means to launch the production of the serial model and to put the Dirisolar in service. 

 
Your contribution up to the € 1 million flexible goal will allow us to build the hangar for the airship's assembly and to realize structural and electrical tests which are significant steps for the project. The additional funds needed to fulfill the project will be shared between crowdfunding, new shareholders, industrial groups and public funding. We are at the present time in close negotiation with a public administration.
 

 
The short term goal is the construction of the demonstrator in France near the headquarters that will validate all the innovations and performances of the Dirisolar.
The long term goal for Dirisolar is to be an airship designer and builder with a few operating sites while renting and selling the Dirisolar to local operators in order to offer the Dirisolar flight experience to the whole world.

The lighter the better
 

Airships are part of the lighter-than-air (LTA) family in the aircraft taxonomy. Unlike heavier-than-air (HTA), LTA does not require energy to stay in the air. The lift is generated by a lifting gas according to Archimedes' principle.                            
The Dirisolar will use helium which is a stable and flame-proof gas that can lift approximately one kilogram per cubic meter.
 
But why have airships disappeared from our sky?
Airships have had a golden age in the early 1900s. At first airships were mostly use for military purposes then they were introduce to civil applications such as the first transatlantic commercial flights. However, airships remained difficult to maneuver due to their sensibility to the wind and meteorological conditions inducing a important flight cancellation rate.

The Hindenburg fire in 1937 and the fast progression of aviation ended the civil use of airships and later on their military missions as well.
 
Why are they coming back?
In 2001, the German firm Zeppelin NT put a new airship into service. This improved performance airship launched the renewal of airships, dozens of innovative projects are emerging around the world.
NASA published in 2016 a file on the situation of airship projects mentioning Dirisolar (page 12). However, so far no projects reached the handiness expected by the market and the operators. The competition between innovative projects is still on, Dirisolar expects to improve the handiness and to greatly reduce the flight cancellation rate.

The world needs less polluting aerial solutions. New technologies, like digital engineering and very light materials, are now available for the come back of airships.

<li>     <strong>First</strong>, Aerobic bacteria consume uneaten food and waste; NOMO speeds up their activity.</li>
<li>      <strong>Second</strong>, anaerobic bacteria leave behind uneaten food and waste which is what spoils the environment. NOMO slows down their activity.</li>
</ul><p>The combination of the two yields the results that allow NOMO to be the answer to millions of fishkeepers who have asked…<strong>There has to be a better way to have fish and enjoy them too!</strong></p><p>With NOMO, your freshwater aquarium water will stay clear, chemical levels will stay within a safe perimeter and your fish won't stress and die because you’re not disrupting their environment on a regular basis by creating stress with regular water changes and gravel vacuuming. There are no replacement filters to worry about and one of the best parts is your aquarium won't smell because the uneaten food and waste are inert, while providing nutrients for plants by creating long, strong roots.

The achievements of NOMO are enhanced using a UGF for several reasons.</p><p>1. One of NOMO'S achieved goals is to <strong>CREATE ""BALANCE"" IN AN AQUARIUM</strong>. In nature, you will find bacteria residing in the substrate or the mud at the bottom of the lake or river and not on a disposable filter pad.  A  UGF allows for the bacteria to be contained within the tank where NOMO can stimulate the bacteria into activity or behavior that creates the results NOMO claims. With the bacteria left undisturbed and in the care of NOMO, balance is achieved. Other filters use media to filter the water, usually outside of the aquarium. Each time a filter is replaced or washed, beneficial bacteria is being tossed out with the particles that have been filtered. This only creates an imbalance in the ecosystem, much like when starting up an aquarium that has no bacteria colonies yet established to consume the newly introduced food and waste the fish are now creating. This is what causes toxins to increase resulting in poor water quality and the need to ""cycle"" a newly set up aquarium.  With NOMO, there is NO NEED TO CYCLE... WOW, this is another FIRST in the Industry! </p><p>2. <strong> UGF'S are INEXPENSIVE</strong> and do not require the additional cost of replacement pads or filter media; the gravel or substrate IS the filter media. This means you don't have to spend additional monies on an ongoing basis resulting in MORE MAINTENANCE and COST for you. This is NOT something product manufacturers like. They want you spending more money to create a constant stream of income for them.  And because UGF's are inexpensive, (providing a tiny profit margin), it’s better for THEM to make a more expensive filtration products that are STILL only a ""Band-Aid"" requiring more money for maintenance as well as your time to perform maintenance. So, of course, retailers will tell you ""UGF's are antiquated”. The most expensive filtration systems are incapable of doing what NOMO does using a UGF! This is backed by the results NOMO provides. We use a UGF because it is the best type of filtration to create sustainability and balance in an aquarium, the least expensive and the most maintenance free. All benefits enjoyed and appreciated by your fish, your plants and you, the end user!  If you do not currently have a UGF, we have contracted with a UGF manufacturer to offer only PREMIUM GRADE UGFS. These are stronger, thicker gauge filter plates that will not break like the thin economy type.</p><p>3.   Another achieved goal of NOMO is to create an <strong>aquarium experience</strong> for the end user that is as close to maintenance free as possible while minimizing operating costs thus freeing up your time and money to do other things while at the same time elevating your aquarium experience to the highest level of enjoyment anyone has yet to experience. NOMO does this with ease.</p><p> </p><h3>NOMO is a Sustainable, Water Conserving and Energy Efficient, product. <strong> How?</strong>
</h3><p><strong>For example</strong>: If you do a 25% water change on a 55 gallon freshwater aquarium every three weeks, that equals to 17 water changes a year and 13.75 gallons of water per water change. That is 233.75 gallons of water a year or 467.5 gallons over two years used for one 55 gallon aquarium. That is a lot of water.</p><p><strong>Compare</strong> that to a 55 gallon freshwater NOMO aquarium. Do a 75 percent water change every two years. That equals to 41.25 gallons of water every two years. Big difference!</p><p><strong>To look at it a different way</strong></p><p>You will need to have 34 fifty-five gallon NOMO aquariums to equal the maintenance for two years of one fifty-five gallon non-NOMO aquarium. <i>Mind boggling!</i></p><p>By maintaining and extending the quality of water in your aquarium, NOMO has the potential to save millions of gallons of water each year.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510534632/ikmonovkcbpyrwyhe8w0.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>How to do a NOMO water change in two years</strong></h3><p>We recommend doing a 75% water change and deep gravel vacuuming about every two years.  If you feel you need to do a small water change and gravel vacuuming the first year do it, after all, it will take time to break habits of the “old way” of keeping fish. You may wish to wipe the interior glass once every two months for light algae using a magnetic glass cleaner made for aquariums. (Note: heavy algae can be a sign of feeding too much or lights being too strong or left on too long). Add water to top off the aquarium due to evaporation and that’s it. Spend the rest of your time enjoying your NOMO aquarium or on an outing with the family.</p><h3><strong>The NOMO Journey 2011-Today</strong></h3><p>We’ve made many prototypes of NOMO, starting out by using a plastic fishing lure box as its housing back in 2011 that we bought at Walmart. We produced some 15 at this time (anyone need a lure?) The solar panel was contained inside the lure box, but that shape presented potential problems, we needed to make NOMO fit different aquarium configurations. NOMO then evolved into two separate components, the control module and a separate solar panel. By creating two components of NOMO, we created more room to enhance NOMO’s capabilities within the control module by allowing for a larger PCB and additional electronics creating the capabilities NOMO offers today. This redesign solved the additional problem of NOMO sitting on top of the aquarium where it could potentially fall into the aquarium by a curious cat or other. Now it is attached to the upper, rear portion of the left side of the tank glass.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510527336/znwezfibjqwhnhyatudp.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The design evolution of NOMO; from 2011…</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510527342/fbkqrrpkn6ljkovzdung.png"" src=""""/></p><p>To now.

NOMO is turning old aquariums into “paintings in motion” as NOMO means no dirty, cloudy water and... No More Water Changes!</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Q #1. <strong>How do the fish and aquatic life react to NOMO?</strong></p><p>Answer: We have seen (and others have commented) that NOMO fish swim with more vigor and vitality as all stress is removed from NOMO aquariums by virtue of the environment is not disrupted on a regular basis.</p><p> </p><p>Q #2. <strong>If I don’t change the water in my fish tank, won’t the water start to smell?</strong></p><p>Answer: No. This is one of the revolutionary achievements of NOMO. By balancing the bacteria activity, NOMO creates a more uniform balance in your aquarium which prevents the odor that comes from undigested food and waste.</p><p> </p><p>Q #3. <strong>Is it safe to have my fish in the same water for two years?</strong></p><p> Answer: Yes. We have had aquariums equipped with NOMO running for over 5 years. Fish are consistently breeding, they are living longer and getting bigger because of their long lifespan.</p><p> </p><p>Q #4.  <strong>How long do I go without a water change?</strong></p><p>Answer: Up to now, the normal method recommended by standard fish keeping is to do a water change every week to three weeks. With NOMO, we recommend changing your water about every two years. This changes the standard fish keeping practices known at this time. We have made it simple.</p><p> </p><p>Q #5: <strong>Do the wires in the gravel harm the fish or live plants?</strong></p><p>Answer: NO. The wires in the gravel emit a very small micro-current that does not affect the fish, inverts or live plants. They don’t even notice it.</p><p> </p><p>Q #6. <strong>Why does NOMO use Gravel as its filter media?</strong></p><p>Answer:   The use of Gravel (not sand or dirt) allows for the free flow of food, waste and oxygen borne water to flow through and past the gravel where food and waste can collect, below the surface of the gravel. It is here, where the bacteria colonies will establish themselves, within in the nook and crannies of the gravel and where they will work to maintain a clean aquarium with the help of NOMO’S revolutionary technology. Sand or dirt will not allow for the flow of oxygen (needed by bacteria) or for the collection of uneaten food and waste below the media’s surface as these materials are more fine and compacted.</p><p> </p><p>Q #7. <strong>How do live plants do with NOMO?</strong></p><p>Answer:   Plants are stimulated by the micro-current technology.  Live plants should always be used as they help a great deal to create balance in any ecosystem and “balance” is what we want and what NOMO strives to maintain.</p><p> </p><p>Q#8. <strong>Why does NOMO use a solar panel?</strong></p><p>Answer:  We use a solar panel for several reasons.                                                       </p><p>1. Saves Energy</p><p>2. Create additional sustainability</p><p>3. Free up an electrical outlet that hobbyists find are in short supply and the unsightly addition of another electrical wire where there is already too many.                                    </p><p>4.  To allow NOMO to be used internationally where voltages are different.</p><p> </p><p>Q #9. <strong>Why is there uplift tubes?</strong></p><p>Answer:  The uplift tubes are components of the Under Gravel Filter and serve to move water and oxygen thru the aquarium and gravel where the bacteria resides. This helps to create healthy bacteria colonies in partnership with NOMO’s stimulation via a micro-current through wire leads. Uplift tubes are not part of NOMO but are part of the under gravel filtration.</p><p> </p><p>Q #10. <strong>How much and how often do I feed my fish?</strong></p><p>Answer: Following is the new standard for feeding with NOMO. When you set up your NOMO aquarium, you must feed your fish lightly for the first few weeks. If your tank becomes a little cloudy while bacteria is being established, you’re feeding too much. Cut back, the cloudiness will go away.</p><p>After that, you can start to feed a little bit more. They only need to be fed once a day (at most) and if you miss a couple days during a week, it’s okay too. Like people, fish also get accustomed to eating a lot or not. Your fish won’t be stressed so they don’t need to be fed so often. If you’re gone for 3-5 days, they can handle this without any ill effects. By noting the physical hardiness of your fish, you will know if you’re feeding too little. A fish should never look skinny or emaciated. If so, increase a little. If you have fry (baby fish), feed them twice a day for the first couple weeks.  Bottom line here is, DO NOT OVERFEED!</p><p> </p><p>Q #11.  <strong>How many fish do I place in my tank?</strong></p><p>Answer: Taking into account for a fish’s future full size, we recommend doing 1” of fish per gallon. If you have Goldfish, Oscars or Discus fish (these are considered “dirty” fish). We suggest 2 or 3 gallons of water per inch of fish. If fish are bigger, increase the gallons per inch of fish.  This is the fish keeping industry standard and we agree. </p><p> </p><p>Q #12. <strong> Do I need to Cycle my aquarium using “sacrificial fish?</strong></p><p>Answer: No. There is no need to send some poor innocent fishes to a known death sentence. This is a controversial issue in the fish keeping industry. All you need to do now is to install NOMO per directions, add gravel, decor, live plants, water and fish. Be sure you have your air pumps or powerheads, lighting and chlorine remover. Then add fish. That’s it.</p><p> </p><p>Q #13.  <strong>What Maintenance will be required with NOMO?</strong></p><p>Answer:  Since NOMO uses a UGF (Under Gravel Filter) there are no replacement filters to change. We recommend you top off the water level to replace evaporated water.  Additionally, you may wish to purchase magnets used to remove any potential algae growth from the glass that is unwanted.  Do a vacuum and water change after one or two years (depends if you have had difficulty in adjusting to the new fish keeping standards) and be sure to remove any algae and mineral buildup on the bottom of the glass lid to ensure your plants and fish continue to get the lighting they need.  As the aquarium owner, ultimately, the responsibility is YOURS to maintain a “balanced” aquarium. However, at NOMO, we just made that a whole lot easier for you. So, take more time now to enjoy your fish, and perhaps some other things you’ve always wanted to do.</p><p> </p><p>Q #14. <strong>Do I need to use an external filter or any other type of canister filters with NOMO?</strong></p><p>Answer: NO. There is no need to use any external filter, hang on the back of the aquarium filters, canister filters or any of the other external filtration systems with NOMO.</p><p> </p><p>Q #15. <strong>What causes stress on fish in aquariums?</strong></p><p>Answer:  Poor water quality due to toxins released by the fish, regular water changes and human intervention such disruption of décor and nets to catch fish. Also, if you don’t have the right fish together, such as aggressive fish with more docile fish. These conditions will cause stress that can lead to death.</p><p> </p><p>Q #16. <strong>Does the Micro-current hurt the fish or plants?</strong></p><p>Answer:  Not at all. This speaks to the success of what NOMO does. The micro-current is so small, the fish don’t even notice it. The plants are stimulated by the current as they take root in the gravel and because the plants are not uprooted each month their roots are usually quite long. Snails and other aquatic life are not affected by the micro-current either.</p><p> </p><p>Q #17. <strong>How much gravel do I place on the UGF?</strong></p><p>Answer:  Aquariums that are 40 gallons or less we suggest 2.5 inches. Larger aquariums that can handle larger fish (which produce more waste) we suggest 3-4“ or more depending on aquarium size and fish size. As more waste is generated, more gravel is required to both allow room for bacteria colonies and to conceal fish waste below the gravel surface.</p><p> </p><p>Q #18. <strong>Do I need to add any chemicals to the water?</strong></p><p>Answer:  The only chemical needed is the dechlorinating product to remove chlorine from the tap water when setting up NOMO or when water evaporates and water is added to replace the evaporation. If you desire to use a liquid plant fertilizer, use as directed; this will be ok.</p><p> </p><p>Q #19.  <strong>Will Ammonia, </strong><strong>Nitrites</strong><strong> and Nitrates build and kill my fish if I do not change the water?</strong></p><p>Answer: If these toxic chemicals are building up, your tank is not balanced properly. This may be due to several factors created by you.</p><p>1.    Too many fish for the size of your aquarium.</p><p>2.    Remember the rule of 1” of fish per gallon of water. 2”-3” for dirty fish such as Oscar, Discus and goldfish. Increase these numbers for larger bodied fish.</p><p>3.    Feeding too much or too frequently.</p><p>With an emphasis on “creating balance” and newly formed habits, your aquarium will be a stress-free, low toxic, and have a clear water environment that in all our test tanks, has been able to go up to two years without a water change.</p><p> </p><p>Q #20.<strong> What about a lack of minerals? Won’t the fish be mineral depleted because the water is not being changed?</strong></p><p>Answer: While fish do get some minerals from water, realize that not all water is the same. In some areas, the water is much less mineralized than others.  Fish get the minerals they need from the other aquatic life and the food they eat.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>How Will We Use the Funds From Your Contribution on Indiegogo?</strong> We will use the funds from this campaign to pay for tooling of molds and supplies to begin mass production of NOMO to the fish keeping industry.

Well, at NOMO, we are here to tell you there is, FINALLY!!   What is NOMO?NOMO is a micro-current technology product that maintains water conditions within safe parameters eliminating water changes for freshwater aquariums for up to two years. This is a first in the Aquarium industry!NOMO also eliminates the need to cycle a new aquarium and the odor from aquariums that are not maintained on a regular timely schedule (both firsts in the industry).So, HOW is this accomplished?NOMO uses a precise micro-current that stimulates bacteria to two different behaviors:
     First, Aerobic bacteria consume uneaten food and waste; NOMO speeds up their activity.
      Second, anaerobic bacteria leave behind uneaten food and waste which is what spoils the environment. NOMO slows down their activity.
The combination of the two yields the results that allow NOMO to be the answer to millions of fishkeepers who have asked…There has to be a better way to have fish and enjoy them too!With NOMO, your freshwater aquarium water will stay clear, chemical levels will stay within a safe perimeter and your fish won't stress and die because you’re not disrupting their environment on a regular basis by creating stress with regular water changes and gravel vacuuming. There are no replacement filters to worry about and one of the best parts is your aquarium won't smell because the uneaten food and waste are inert, while providing nutrients for plants by creating long, strong roots. Everyone benefits from the healthy environment NOMO provides, especially you!Enjoy having the aquatic results of a professional maintenance company without all the cost or labor.55-gallon freshwater aquarium. Fish and plants are healthy. No water changes for two years. Set up May 2014. Questions to consider?1. What is the value of your time per hour, per day, week or month?2. What would a maintenance company charge to maintain your aquarium?3. How much time do you spend maintaining your aquarium(s)?4. How much money do you spend on aquarium products?5. Does your aquarium reflect the value of your time, money and efforts with the successful results you get?The vast majority of aquatic products available for fish keepers are nothing more than a Band-Aid approach, only masking the real issue by requiring you to buy another chemical or product to counter an unwanted effect from the previous one purchased while never correcting the root problem. No wonder so many people get fed up and sell their aquarium! NOMO was developed to be the SOLUTION by addressing and resolving long-standing issues aquarists have complained and lamented over for decades such as aquariums being high maintenance, labor-intensive, time-consuming and expensive.Buckets are great to use when washing your car, not sloshing smelly, poopy fish water all over the living room every week or two.These external, “hang on the back” filtration devices are high maintenance, noisy, smelly, unsightly, inefficient, and unfriendly in achieving bacteria balance. This system needs to have the filter media cleaned or replaced regularly.This picture shows a dirty filter that needs to be replaced as it is full of fish poop and smells terrible. Beneficial bacteria reside in this external filter and are removed when the filter is disposed of creating an imbalance in the ecosystem. What a dilemma! NOMO is a onetime, very reasonable, upfront cost.  NOMO will pay for itself in a very short time with no added costs due to the high maintenance, current replacement filters, canister filters or added chemicals needed each month to maintain a healthy aquarium. The cost of filter media is very expensive and more so with larger aquariums. NOMO eliminates all that extra expense. Enjoy the savings and the additional free time from maintenance chores!We are so confident you will love NOMO and that it will be all you hope to find in a fishkeeping product that we are offing a Full One Year money back guarantee.NOMO’s proven technology is taking aquariums to a new level of enjoyment never before experienced in the fish keeping industry. It is clear enjoyment for you, your family and your freshwater fish! With NOMO aquarium maintenance is minimal and easy, making your aquarium MORE enjoyable than ever before.*No More water changes for up to two years*No More water cycling needed*No More smelly odor The NOMO Advantage                    365+                                         30+
     Days without a water change                       Days without a water change  Product Features Main Control ModuleThe control module contains a printed circuit board with state of the art electronic components, a Lithium Phosphate (LiFePO4) rechargeable battery and a red LED indicator light letting you know NOMO is working. Ports or connection points for the leads (wires) go to the solar panel and to the gravel, work continuously day and night to keep your aquarium clean and clear. NOMO provides the healthiest environment possible for your fish and plant life.  Solar Panel and CasingNOMO’s solar panel provides energy to the rechargeable battery in the control module, operating off the aquarium light making it globally friendly and sustainable Green Technology. When the aquarium light is turned off at night NOMO is still working via its rechargeable battery and the energy received during the day when the light was on.  The solar panel is a thin design so as to fit between the aquarium glass top and the light in your aquarium.No More bulky plugs and extension cords since NOMO is solar powered.   Image of a UGF (under gravel filtration system)Why does NOMO use an Under Gravel Filter (UGF)?Aren’t UGF’s obsolete and antiquated?All aquariums need a filtration system. The achievements of NOMO are enhanced using a UGF for several reasons.1. One of NOMO'S achieved goals is to CREATE ""BALANCE"" IN AN AQUARIUM. In nature, you will find bacteria residing in the substrate or the mud at the bottom of the lake or river and not on a disposable filter pad.  A  UGF allows for the bacteria to be contained within the tank where NOMO can stimulate the bacteria into activity or behavior that creates the results NOMO claims. With the bacteria left undisturbed and in the care of NOMO, balance is achieved. Other filters use media to filter the water, usually outside of the aquarium. Each time a filter is replaced or washed, beneficial bacteria is being tossed out with the particles that have been filtered. This only creates an imbalance in the ecosystem, much like when starting up an aquarium that has no bacteria colonies yet established to consume the newly introduced food and waste the fish are now creating. This is what causes toxins to increase resulting in poor water quality and the need to ""cycle"" a newly set up aquarium.  With NOMO, there is NO NEED TO CYCLE... WOW, this is another FIRST in the Industry! 2.  UGF'S are INEXPENSIVE and do not require the additional cost of replacement pads or filter media; the gravel or substrate IS the filter media. This means you don't have to spend additional monies on an ongoing basis resulting in MORE MAINTENANCE and COST for you. This is NOT something product manufacturers like. They want you spending more money to create a constant stream of income for them.  And because UGF's are inexpensive, (providing a tiny profit margin), it’s better for THEM to make a more expensive filtration products that are STILL only a ""Band-Aid"" requiring more money for maintenance as well as your time to perform maintenance. So, of course, retailers will tell you ""UGF's are antiquated”. The most expensive filtration systems are incapable of doing what NOMO does using a UGF! This is backed by the results NOMO provides. We use a UGF because it is the best type of filtration to create sustainability and balance in an aquarium, the least expensive and the most maintenance free. All benefits enjoyed and appreciated by your fish, your plants and you, the end user!  If you do not currently have a UGF, we have contracted with a UGF manufacturer to offer only PREMIUM GRADE UGFS. These are stronger, thicker gauge filter plates that will not break like the thin economy type.3.   Another achieved goal of NOMO is to create an aquarium experience for the end user that is as close to maintenance free as possible while minimizing operating costs thus freeing up your time and money to do other things while at the same time elevating your aquarium experience to the highest level of enjoyment anyone has yet to experience. NOMO does this with ease. NOMO is a Sustainable, Water Conserving and Energy Efficient, product.  How?
For example: If you do a 25% water change on a 55 gallon freshwater aquarium every three weeks, that equals to 17 water changes a year and 13.75 gallons of water per water change. That is 233.75 gallons of water a year or 467.5 gallons over two years used for one 55 gallon aquarium. That is a lot of water.Compare that to a 55 gallon freshwater NOMO aquarium. Do a 75 percent water change every two years. That equals to 41.25 gallons of water every two years. Big difference!To look at it a different wayYou will need to have 34 fifty-five gallon NOMO aquariums to equal the maintenance for two years of one fifty-five gallon non-NOMO aquarium. Mind boggling!By maintaining and extending the quality of water in your aquarium, NOMO has the potential to save millions of gallons of water each year. How to do a NOMO water change in two yearsWe recommend doing a 75% water change and deep gravel vacuuming about every two years.  If you feel you need to do a small water change and gravel vacuuming the first year do it, after all, it will take time to break habits of the “old way” of keeping fish. You may wish to wipe the interior glass once every two months for light algae using a magnetic glass cleaner made for aquariums. (Note: heavy algae can be a sign of feeding too much or lights being too strong or left on too long). Add water to top off the aquarium due to evaporation and that’s it. Spend the rest of your time enjoying your NOMO aquarium or on an outing with the family.The NOMO Journey 2011-TodayWe’ve made many prototypes of NOMO, starting out by using a plastic fishing lure box as its housing back in 2011 that we bought at Walmart. We produced some 15 at this time (anyone need a lure?) The solar panel was contained inside the lure box, but that shape presented potential problems, we needed to make NOMO fit different aquarium configurations. NOMO then evolved into two separate components, the control module and a separate solar panel. By creating two components of NOMO, we created more room to enhance NOMO’s capabilities within the control module by allowing for a larger PCB and additional electronics creating the capabilities NOMO offers today. This redesign solved the additional problem of NOMO sitting on top of the aquarium where it could potentially fall into the aquarium by a curious cat or other. Now it is attached to the upper, rear portion of the left side of the tank glass.The design evolution of NOMO; from 2011…To now. NOMO has a sleek and appealing design as well as a more appealing logo as seen above. These are the very first NOMO test aquariums set up fall of 2011. The two in the background behind David and to his right were 55 gallon Oscar aquariums. They were already dirty. We put NOMO in one of them and within two weeks the water cleared up and was crystal clear. The other non-NOMO aquarium was struggling and the Oscar was gilling heavily; we needed to change the water immediately. In this picture, David is cleaning the non-NOMO 55 gallon Oscar aquarium.These are two of our A/B 20 gallon test aquariums 2016. The left one used an external filtration with replacement filters smells as evidenced by David’s reaction. The one on the right is a NOMO aquarium. As you can see, the non-NOMO aquarium needed to have the water changed.  No water changes for the NOMO aquarium during testing.Our many beta testers have been amazed at the results. Never before has a fish keeping product been able to resolve the negative aspects of aquarium maintenance until NOMO. This first NOMO is for freshwater aquariums. The technology for saltwater aquariums is different but is another product we want to offer in the near future. (See Our Stretch Goal below) David setting up a freshwater NOMO aquarium in the lobby at UVU/BRC March 2015. UVU/BRC lobby. No water changes for two years. First water change was April 2017. Aquarium looks great and no smelly fish water. Fish and plant life is flourishing. Frank’s freshwater aquarium set up May 2014 in his shop lobby. He wanted an aquarium in the lobby of his business but didn’t want to have the high maintenance associated with fish keeping.  This three-year-old loves her 10 gallon NOMO aquarium. Each morning she and her mom turn on the aquarium lights and feed the fish. They take a few moments to enjoy looking at the fish and counting each one. This starts their day off together. Her mom says she wanted to get her daughter a fish tank but, she doesn’t have time to take care of one. She has way too many things to do during her day to worry about taking care of a fish tank. Since she got a NOMO aquarium for her 3-year-old, they can enjoy having one and mom doesn’t have to worry about a smelly dirty fish tank she has to clean every couple weeks. (This aquarium was set up September 2016 and has not had a water change, yet)        NOMO aquarium set up January 1, 2016The top of the tank is closed, the aquarium is protected from kitties, floating airborne dust and other foreign matter.                                     Be the one of the first 250 to get your NOMO shirt                                                                     The first 250 contributors will get a free NOMO t-shirt.                                               We will contact you for your shirt size. The NOMO TeamFounders: David and Georganne Simeoli- our vision, hard work and determination to create such an amazing fish keeping product in the pet industry couldn’t have happened without our amazing NOMO team.

Having owned our share (fresh and salt) we are also individuals who can’t stand (yes, even HATE) the smell and CHORE of regular water changes and gravel cleaning.So... we got to work to find a solution, and... WE DID IT! Now, NOMO offers you all the advantages of aquarium ownership making it 100% enjoyable, without the typical pain and hassle.With NOMO, a child can successfully keep fish without parents needing to take over the job, while aquarium enthusiasts alike will have a new found love and appreciation for the hobby. NOMO is turning old aquariums into “paintings in motion” as NOMO means no dirty, cloudy water and... No More Water Changes!  FAQQ #1. How do the fish and aquatic life react to NOMO?Answer: We have seen (and others have commented) that NOMO fish swim with more vigor and vitality as all stress is removed from NOMO aquariums by virtue of the environment is not disrupted on a regular basis. Q #2. If I don’t change the water in my fish tank, won’t the water start to smell?Answer: No. This is one of the revolutionary achievements of NOMO. By balancing the bacteria activity, NOMO creates a more uniform balance in your aquarium which prevents the odor that comes from undigested food and waste. Q #3. Is it safe to have my fish in the same water for two years? Answer: Yes. We have had aquariums equipped with NOMO running for over 5 years. Fish are consistently breeding, they are living longer and getting bigger because of their long lifespan. Q #4.  How long do I go without a water change?Answer: Up to now, the normal method recommended by standard fish keeping is to do a water change every week to three weeks. With NOMO, we recommend changing your water about every two years. This changes the standard fish keeping practices known at this time. We have made it simple. Q #5: Do the wires in the gravel harm the fish or live plants?Answer: NO. The wires in the gravel emit a very small micro-current that does not affect the fish, inverts or live plants. They don’t even notice it. Q #6. Why does NOMO use Gravel as its filter media?Answer:   The use of Gravel (not sand or dirt) allows for the free flow of food, waste and oxygen borne water to flow through and past the gravel where food and waste can collect, below the surface of the gravel. It is here, where the bacteria colonies will establish themselves, within in the nook and crannies of the gravel and where they will work to maintain a clean aquarium with the help of NOMO’S revolutionary technology. Sand or dirt will not allow for the flow of oxygen (needed by bacteria) or for the collection of uneaten food and waste below the media’s surface as these materials are more fine and compacted. Q #7. How do live plants do with NOMO?Answer:   Plants are stimulated by the micro-current technology.  Live plants should always be used as they help a great deal to create balance in any ecosystem and “balance” is what we want and what NOMO strives to maintain. Q#8. Why does NOMO use a solar panel?Answer:  We use a solar panel for several reasons.                                                       1. Saves Energy2. Create additional sustainability3. Free up an electrical outlet that hobbyists find are in short supply and the unsightly addition of another electrical wire where there is already too many.                                    4.  To allow NOMO to be used internationally where voltages are different. Q #9. Why is there uplift tubes?Answer:  The uplift tubes are components of the Under Gravel Filter and serve to move water and oxygen thru the aquarium and gravel where the bacteria resides. This helps to create healthy bacteria colonies in partnership with NOMO’s stimulation via a micro-current through wire leads. Uplift tubes are not part of NOMO but are part of the under gravel filtration. Q #10. How much and how often do I feed my fish?Answer: Following is the new standard for feeding with NOMO. When you set up your NOMO aquarium, you must feed your fish lightly for the first few weeks. If your tank becomes a little cloudy while bacteria is being established, you’re feeding too much. Cut back, the cloudiness will go away.After that, you can start to feed a little bit more. They only need to be fed once a day (at most) and if you miss a couple days during a week, it’s okay too. Like people, fish also get accustomed to eating a lot or not. Your fish won’t be stressed so they don’t need to be fed so often. If you’re gone for 3-5 days, they can handle this without any ill effects. By noting the physical hardiness of your fish, you will know if you’re feeding too little. A fish should never look skinny or emaciated. If so, increase a little. If you have fry (baby fish), feed them twice a day for the first couple weeks.  Bottom line here is, DO NOT OVERFEED! Q #11.  How many fish do I place in my tank?Answer: Taking into account for a fish’s future full size, we recommend doing 1” of fish per gallon. If you have Goldfish, Oscars or Discus fish (these are considered “dirty” fish). We suggest 2 or 3 gallons of water per inch of fish. If fish are bigger, increase the gallons per inch of fish.  This is the fish keeping industry standard and we agree.  Q #12.  Do I need to Cycle my aquarium using “sacrificial fish?Answer: No. There is no need to send some poor innocent fishes to a known death sentence. This is a controversial issue in the fish keeping industry. All you need to do now is to install NOMO per directions, add gravel, decor, live plants, water and fish. Be sure you have your air pumps or powerheads, lighting and chlorine remover. Then add fish. That’s it. Q #13.  What Maintenance will be required with NOMO?Answer:  Since NOMO uses a UGF (Under Gravel Filter) there are no replacement filters to change. We recommend you top off the water level to replace evaporated water.  Additionally, you may wish to purchase magnets used to remove any potential algae growth from the glass that is unwanted.  Do a vacuum and water change after one or two years (depends if you have had difficulty in adjusting to the new fish keeping standards) and be sure to remove any algae and mineral buildup on the bottom of the glass lid to ensure your plants and fish continue to get the lighting they need.  As the aquarium owner, ultimately, the responsibility is YOURS to maintain a “balanced” aquarium. However, at NOMO, we just made that a whole lot easier for you. So, take more time now to enjoy your fish, and perhaps some other things you’ve always wanted to do. Q #14. Do I need to use an external filter or any other type of canister filters with NOMO?Answer: NO. There is no need to use any external filter, hang on the back of the aquarium filters, canister filters or any of the other external filtration systems with NOMO. Q #15. What causes stress on fish in aquariums?Answer:  Poor water quality due to toxins released by the fish, regular water changes and human intervention such disruption of décor and nets to catch fish. Also, if you don’t have the right fish together, such as aggressive fish with more docile fish. These conditions will cause stress that can lead to death. Q #16. Does the Micro-current hurt the fish or plants?Answer:  Not at all. This speaks to the success of what NOMO does. The micro-current is so small, the fish don’t even notice it. The plants are stimulated by the current as they take root in the gravel and because the plants are not uprooted each month their roots are usually quite long. Snails and other aquatic life are not affected by the micro-current either. Q #17. How much gravel do I place on the UGF?Answer:  Aquariums that are 40 gallons or less we suggest 2.5 inches. Larger aquariums that can handle larger fish (which produce more waste) we suggest 3-4“ or more depending on aquarium size and fish size. As more waste is generated, more gravel is required to both allow room for bacteria colonies and to conceal fish waste below the gravel surface. Q #18. Do I need to add any chemicals to the water?Answer:  The only chemical needed is the dechlorinating product to remove chlorine from the tap water when setting up NOMO or when water evaporates and water is added to replace the evaporation. If you desire to use a liquid plant fertilizer, use as directed; this will be ok. Q #19.  Will Ammonia, Nitrites and Nitrates build and kill my fish if I do not change the water?Answer: If these toxic chemicals are building up, your tank is not balanced properly. This may be due to several factors created by you.1.    Too many fish for the size of your aquarium.2.    Remember the rule of 1” of fish per gallon of water. 2”-3” for dirty fish such as Oscar, Discus and goldfish. Increase these numbers for larger bodied fish.3.    Feeding too much or too frequently.With an emphasis on “creating balance” and newly formed habits, your aquarium will be a stress-free, low toxic, and have a clear water environment that in all our test tanks, has been able to go up to two years without a water change. Q #20. What about a lack of minerals? Won’t the fish be mineral depleted because the water is not being changed?Answer: While fish do get some minerals from water, realize that not all water is the same. In some areas, the water is much less mineralized than others.  Fish get the minerals they need from the other aquatic life and the food they eat.  How Will We Use the Funds From Your Contribution on Indiegogo? We will use the funds from this campaign to pay for tooling of molds and supplies to begin mass production of NOMO to the fish keeping industry. With your contribution, you will get the first NOMO's made and help us launch into the fish keeping market with a disruptive product with the potential to change fish keeping standards forever and take it to a whole new level of enjoyment.Our Stretch Goal: By exceeding our Indiegogo goal of contributions, we will be able to begin testing our Salt Water technology. The salt water technology is different from the freshwater technology.  So, if you are a saltwater fish tank enthusiast, please make your contribution towards this campaign so we can reach our stretch goal and begin that testing of the salt water technology. If you know someone who has a saltwater aquarium or who wants a saltwater aquarium, please pass this information on to them. They will be happy you did!The potential for NOMO’s technology to be used in other areas is great and far-reaching. These areas include aquaponics and septic systems outside of saltwater aquariums and outdoor ponds. Warranty: NOMO comes with a one year money back guarantee. Possible Risks & Challenges: We have worked several years developing and perfecting this version of NOMO for freshwater fish tanks. However, because of your feedback, there will always be improvements and innovations to be made, after all, we will be listening to you and your suggestions to continue to deliver the best innovative products available in the NOMO line of products both now, and yet to come. By pledging to support NOMO, you are doing so with the understanding that this is a new product with disruptive technology that will radically change the way fish tanks are maintained and which we are striving to make available to you and the fish keeping industry at large. We do not take your support lightly and thank you for your support both now and in the future for allowing NOMO to change an industry that has long been stagnant. Product Adjustments: To provide the best product possible, extensive design, redesign and testing have taken place over the past 6 years. NOMO is now ready to go to market. However, minor adjustments may be needed in the manufacturing as every step we take is a process of learning. Our goal is to get NOMO to you inside of 6 months from the close of funding. We certainly will keep all customers informed on a regular basis of our progress throughout manufacturing and fulfillment of your order. However, in the end, your patience will be appreciated as “life has a way of happening after you make plans”. Either way, we are committed to you, your satisfaction and the “pure enjoyment” of your aquarium as never before experienced with NOMO’S Micro-Current Technology.Manufacturing: We have set up manufacturing at a local US based manufacturing facility in Utah. That way we can oversee NOMO's production and quality.Fulfillment: Despite the best planning, there may be factors that we cannot control such as equipment malfunction, transport or delay in supplies. We will strive to produce the product quickly and make sure that the early perks and Indiegogo supporters are given priority. After all, it is you, our customer that we will always strive to please and take care of.Future Products: by reaching our Indiegogo stretch goal, the NOMO team will begin testing the salt water technology. Once that is completed, we will introduce it through an Indiegogo campaign. We will keep you updated and in the know during this time. You can also watch our progress on our website at getnomo.com. After the saltwater NOMO is completed, we will work on other areas of product development to improve the fishkeeping experience globally. Disclaimer: Delivery of perks and rewards are subject to best efforts and not guaranteed. We are confident we will deliver to all contributors. We will keep each of you updated through email on the progress of production and goals met.Additional Disclaimer: NOMO does not and will not claim to cure any fish or fish tank related diseases or other problems that may occur by having a fish. Proper feeding and minor tank maintenance is still required to maintain a healthy fish tank. To all those who supported NOMO on Indiegogo: We have been able to make this dream a reality because of you.Thanks so much for all your support and contributions!Please let us know how you heard about NOMO.

Buy a Solévolt system for yourself and reduce your CO2 footprint by over half every year. Our systems are great for household use, camping, RVs, and as a backup power source. Also, a portion of every sale will go towards providing energy to schools, clinics and homes in need - OR -


Off-set your carbon footprint and lift a community out of poverty by buying some hours of Solévolt power for some of the 1.2 billion people in the world currently without access to electricity

Help us achieve our goals by buying a system for your own use...
Our flagship product, Enterprise, is a portable, easy-to-use, plug-and-play, modular solar generation and storage system. Enterprise is great for off-grid tiny homes, camping, RVs and backup power. Thanks to its lithium-ion battery, it’s powerful enough to recharge phones, tablets, laptops, and household appliances like refrigerators and TVs.


The core of the system is the 'powerbox' which includes:


1.2 kWh lithium-ion battery (expandable to 2.4 kWh) – high quality, safe, UL-listed
1000W inverter
High quality MPPT charge controller
Plugs and sockets: charge all of your devices with USB, AC, DC and car cigarette lighter sockets. Charge the battery from the AC adapter or solar panels (integrated MC4 sockets)
Weighs 20kg (44 lbs)


* - 110V available for US & Canada
The system comes with four LED lights. Solar panels are sold separately, and the system can take up to 1000W in parallel.

(Photo: Solévolt- Enterprise system seen here in Guinea is capable of charging a number of devices and small appliances and can travel wherever you need them). 
A portion of every Solévolt system sold will help us provide solar energy to schools and clinics in parts of Guinea and the Philippines which would otherwise lack electricity. For every 50 units sold, we'll donate and install a complete 1kW, 2.4kWh system, and update you periodically through videos and social media.

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>The impact of this project is far-reaching. One facility at full capacity can handle over 200 tons of food waste monthly. From there, we multiply. This addresses our first social problem, the environment. But we won't stop there, we also want to advance charity. </p>

These are the ways we commit to philanthropy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell soil Amendment at a very low cost to poor farmers with nutrient deficient soil </li>
<li>Establish Bali’s first soup kitchen where anyone can come, eat and hear about Jesus</li>
</ul>
<p>Long term: </p>
<ul>
<li>Link the soup kitchen with a small orphanage</li>
<li>Build a rigorous academic school for the homeless children of Bali</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>By supporting our project, you get to be a part of a company that wants to do more than just become profitable.</strong> We can solve environmental concerns and use that as a springboard to be unconditionally charitable.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>The actual process of food waste to animal feed is relatively simple. The three main challenges in BSF production are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Few animal farms are willing to try a new and untested product.</li>
<li>Strict regulations in western countries impede new protein development.</li>
<li>High investment costs are required to cover land, labor and capital.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>We have a clear path to overcome these hurdles</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>We have already partnered with farms that are willing to help us develop new feed.</li>
<li>We are industry and self-regulating; our own due diligence requires us to lab test our product and maintain the highest quality. </li>
<li>The cost of living is extremely low compared to western standards, making all of our start-up costs significantly less than they would be in America. </li>
</ol>
<p>We are fully prepared to take on the challenges inherent with a start-up. We have already solved some of the problems facing other BSF start-ups. We have the plan, creativity and work ethic to make this project a raging success.</p>

I’m Justin, founder of Nguyen Solutions. I have been studying Black Soldier Flies (BSF) for 3 years; last year I quit working full time to work out a viable way to commercially produce them. I have made a career out of solving problems. As an education consultant, I am constantly overcoming teaching obstacles for firms, private schools and home schools. Working in hospitality management, there have also been numerous instances that have required crafty conflict resolution. Now I set my sights on the environment.
I am joined by a dilligent, bilingual team, built on this ground breaking idea to spark a revolution in the waste management and animal food industries.
We started Nguyen Solutions as an engine to drive change:

As Christians, we believe it is important to be a good stewards of the earth.
As families, we believe its our responsibility to make a better world for the next generation.
As Libertarians, we believe that social problems like the environment can be solved with market ingenuity.

With the help of our backers, we can put form to the world we envision. By creating new wealth from food waste, Nguyen Solutions is tackling one of the biggest social problems of our time: the environment. With food waste going to landfills at the tune of 1.3 billion tons annually, it is time to make a move. Not to restrict, not to regulate, but to create. Producing animal food via Black Soldier Flies, we will take something unusable and into it breathe new life.
Black Soldier Flies
BSF are INCREDIBLE. A complete realization of BSF potential will radically affect multiple industries: soil enrichment, waste management, livestock feed, petroleum diesel and even skin care. The full benefits are still being discovered.  We are using BSF because they possess specific benefits that we can harness. The number one benefit is that they become a protein rich, low cost animal feed. 
Other benefits: 

Non-nuisance, anti-social, sanitary (don't spread disease)
Eat food leftovers, up to 10 times their weight a day 
High in protein, fat and calcium 
self-harvesting
Super durable
Produce tons of nitrogen rich soil amendment  

Bright future:
The fats can be refined into biodiesel 
When the fats are removed, the protein is separated out and can still be used in animal feed! This can solve a major problem in driving down the price for biodiesel, because the byproducts still generate revenue. 
Their exoskeleton is high in chitin
Chitin is becoming known as a substance that is very beneficial for skin care. Promising research is currently underway with cosmetic companies collecting chitin from BSF.

The Project: Brass Tacks
Food leftovers from hotels and restaurants will be delivered to our recycling plant for processing. BSF will consume food waste for 14-18 days before self-harvesting. Next, they will be inactivated, sanitized and made into animal feed. This feed will be lab tested for quality and sent to a farm to be tested for efficacy.

I am usually based at the Four Seasons Resort Mauritius at Anahita and, for a month, I was also based at Four Seasons Seychelles learning about the Reef Restoration Project. My work is to provide guests information on the marine biodiversity of Mauritius and to discover our beautiful reef through our Reef Discovery Snorkel program. We also have the Marvelous Mangrove Snorkel program where I bring guests to discover the creatures living inside the mangrove. I am passionate about wildlife, oceans, and conservation, and have been since a very young age. I also work with endemic and endangered birds, reptiles, marine mammals, sea turtles, tropical fish, and corals. In 2015, I was awarded a place for participation in the Mandela Washington Fellowship Program where I got the chance to do a course in Leadership at the Goldman Public Policy School at the University of California, Berkeley. After that, I got the chance to participate in a summit with President Obama, which really inspired me. Before going back home, I did a professional development program at the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. I have always been really influenced by old time inventors, fascinated by how they creatively thought and observed things around them, and I always try to think in the same way and try to get new ideas to solve issues. My favorite inventor is Garrett Morgan.  </p><p><br/>The ocean is everything to me and I am sick of seeing marine animals dying due to plastic pollution. I want to give the ocean a second chance. International ocean plastic pollution is at an all-time high, and it is devastating habitats, the health of humans and animals, livelihoods, and communities alike. This is a massive global problem and we need to act now. In my spare time I invented a revolutionary machine to collect underwater and ocean surface plastic from the ocean, without hurting marine or aquatic life. Internationally the device will be an enormous help in cleaning the planet and will benefit many countries around the world. This project will create jobs, improve tourism, protect livelihoods, and at the same time clean our beautiful oceans, giving marine life a second chance to live peacefully again. The project will educate governments, organizations and schools about the dangers of plastic pollution, and promote recycling instead of dumping. Everyone loves being in a clean ocean to snorkel, dive, and swim. If we do not protect our oceans from pollution, we will not only lose our tourists, but it will negatively impact all the local communities and livelihoods including locals, skippers, hotel staff, fishermen and future generations around the world.</p><p> </p><p>The project is at prototype level, but by reproducing ocean conditions in an aquarium, we can prove that the device works. To date, in a 10 litre tank, with pieces of plastic (2cm squared), the device has taken 100 % of plastic in less than 2 minutes, both on the surface and underwater. The contribution will help us to develop the prototype into an advance device for the first year once we have the required budget. It will make a huge difference into saving the ocean.</p><p><strong>Methodology:</strong>  <br/>The Ocean Cleaner Device works in two ways: on the surface and under water <br/> <br/><i>On the surface </i><br/>The Ocean Cleaner Device uses a source of energy that will be sent through the Plastic Attraction Unit (PAU). The PAU will then attract the plastic floating on the ocean surface. Once <br/>there is a large amount of plastic concentrated around the PAU, it will be collected by using a pumping system which will direct the plastic to a container.  <br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531332405/uoamfwjv34qqtfqcze3b.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> <br/> <br/><i>Underwater </i><br/>The second part of the Ocean Cleaner Device uses another source of energy. The unit which attracts plastic underwater is called the ‘Underwater Plastic Attraction Unit’. Once the plastic has been dragged to the surface, it can be collected with the PAU and sent to the pumping system joined to the plastic collection container.  </p><p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531332450/f3x1rkmkq404swaouwmk.png"" src=""""/><br/> <br/>Neither method hurts marine life. <br/> <br/><strong>Execution:  </strong><br/>There are two possible executions for this project: moving and stationary. <br/> <br/><i>Moving  </i><br/>We can use secondary data from studies and reports investigating and identifying marine debris sites -this will tell us which areas are more affected by plastic pollution and we can visit these places for cleaning. A 50ft vessel (min. size) will be needed to store collected plastic. </p><p><i>Stationary </i><br/>We can also leave the device in a specific place where it will continuously collect plastic. This concept is suitable for areas in which water current is strong.  <br/> </p><p><strong>Similar Devices  </strong><br/>Ocean Clean Up <br/>The Ocean Clean Up is an ambitious invention designed by Boyan Slat, who was just 19 years old when he started the project. He uses a passive system, utilising ocean currents as its driving <br/>force, to catch and concentrate surface plastic. By suspending a large sea anchor in deep, slow moving water, his team can slow down their 600m floating device enough for the plastic to move faster than the cleanup system. This causes the plastic to accumulate against the plastic collector. Our Ocean Cleaner Device also collects plastic from the surface of the ocean, yet it requires less water surface area to operate, as it is used from a single boat, or stationary platform, to attract plastic. The Ocean Clean Up works only on the ocean surface, whereas the Ocean Cleaner Device will also collect plastic underwater and on the bottom of the seabed. The Ocean Cleaner Device uses not only ocean current, but also boat movement -therefore it is more maneuverable, allowing work on specific sites with greater priorities and greater concentrations of plastic. The project not only cleans the ocean, but also educates the world with our findings, and lets people know what a bad state the ocean is in. <br/> <br/>Seabin <br/>The Seabin is a floating rubbish bin located in the water at marinas, docks, yacht clubs, and commercial ports. The Seabin moves up and down with the range of tide, collecting floating rubbish. Water is sucked in from the surface and passes through a catch bag inside the Seabin. It uses a submersible water pump capable of displacing 25.000 LPH (litres per hour), plugged directly into a 110/22V outlet. The water is then pumped back into the marina, leaving litter and debris trapped in the catch bag to be disposed of properly. The Seabin also has the potential to collect a percentage of oils and pollutants floating on the water surface. It is, however, a fixed device, only able to collect surface rubbish. The Ocean Cleaner Device is movable, collects from the surface and underwater, and it can access places other than ports and docks. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Financial proposal for the first year </u></strong></p><p> </p><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody><tr><td style=""width:623px;"">

It has been stated that less than 5% of the world’s oceans have been explored. The total volume of ocean is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers, with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters. Moreover, the oceans are a significant source of oxygen for our planet and are instrumental in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide. Marine species provide important ecosystem services such as the provision of food, medicines, and livelihoods. They also support tourism and recreational activities around the world. 80% of our land pollution ends up in the ocean and if we don’t do anything, it will lead to scarcity of ocean food, unemployment, and will negatively affect the people’s livelihood. In 1975, the National Academy of Sciences estimated that cargo ships and cruise ships had dumped 14 billion pounds of garbage into the ocean. Over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 sea mammals are killed by pollution every year.  The project is at prototype level, but by reproducing ocean conditions in an aquarium, we can prove that the device works.

A 50ft vessel (min. size) will be needed to store collected plastic. Stationary We can also leave the device in a specific place where it will continuously collect plastic. This concept is suitable for areas in which water current is strong.   Similar Devices  Ocean Clean Up The Ocean Clean Up is an ambitious invention designed by Boyan Slat, who was just 19 years old when he started the project. He uses a passive system, utilising ocean currents as its driving force, to catch and concentrate surface plastic. By suspending a large sea anchor in deep, slow moving water, his team can slow down their 600m floating device enough for the plastic to move faster than the cleanup system. This causes the plastic to accumulate against the plastic collector. Our Ocean Cleaner Device also collects plastic from the surface of the ocean, yet it requires less water surface area to operate, as it is used from a single boat, or stationary platform, to attract plastic. The Ocean Clean Up works only on the ocean surface, whereas the Ocean Cleaner Device will also collect plastic underwater and on the bottom of the seabed. The Ocean Cleaner Device uses not only ocean current, but also boat movement -therefore it is more maneuverable, allowing work on specific sites with greater priorities and greater concentrations of plastic. The project not only cleans the ocean, but also educates the world with our findings, and lets people know what a bad state the ocean is in.  Seabin The Seabin is a floating rubbish bin located in the water at marinas, docks, yacht clubs, and commercial ports. The Seabin moves up and down with the range of tide, collecting floating rubbish. Water is sucked in from the surface and passes through a catch bag inside the Seabin. It uses a submersible water pump capable of displacing 25.000 LPH (litres per hour), plugged directly into a 110/22V outlet. The water is then pumped back into the marina, leaving litter and debris trapped in the catch bag to be disposed of properly. The Seabin also has the potential to collect a percentage of oils and pollutants floating on the water surface. It is, however, a fixed device, only able to collect surface rubbish. The Ocean Cleaner Device is movable, collects from the surface and underwater, and it can access places other than ports and docks.   Financial proposal for the first year

     We are very excited to provide a contributor certificate for those who contribute to our project.The ocean covers around 72% of the planet's surface and contains 97% of Earth's water. It has been stated that less than 5% of the world’s oceans have been explored. The total volume of ocean is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers, with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters. Moreover, the oceans are a significant source of oxygen for our planet and are instrumental in the capture and storage of carbon dioxide. Marine species provide important ecosystem services such as the provision of food, medicines, and livelihoods. They also support tourism and recreational activities around the world. 80% of our land pollution ends up in the ocean and if we don’t do anything, it will lead to scarcity of ocean food, unemployment, and will negatively affect the people’s livelihood. In 1975, the National Academy of Sciences estimated that cargo ships and cruise ships had dumped 14 billion pounds of garbage into the ocean. Over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 sea mammals are killed by pollution every year.  The project is at prototype level, but by reproducing ocean conditions in an aquarium, we can prove that the device works. To date, in a 10 litre tank, with pieces of plastic (2cm squared), the device has taken 100 % of plastic in less than 2 minutes, both on the surface and underwater.Please don’t hesitate to share this to your friends and family. And don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Are you at an outdoor event and want to play some music from your portable speakers, but the batteries just wont last?</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Our Project</span><br/></p> <p>At half the weight of high-capacity lithium-ion batteries, our portable power generator is designed to produce 20 watts for up to 100 hours while weighing less than 10 pounds. This is enough power to charge 2-4 smart devices at a time, and it can produce enough to charge about 50 smart phones in a single day. Using commonly available bottle fuel, this system is inexpensive, accessible, and safe to use. From military, to emergency services, to private use, this device can keep your small devices charged in any situation.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p>
<h3>Target Performance</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 kg (8.8 lbs) final gross weight</li>
<li>20 W continuous operation for 100 hours (2,000 W-hr equivalent)</li>
<li>Emergency 20 W output for up to 15 min in extreme environments</li>
<li>Emergency 200 W output for 5 min burst</li>
<li>Switchable 5 / 12 Volt DC output, with a variety of receptacles</li>
<li>Operable while stationary or carried in all weather conditions</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Advantage</h3>
<p>There is virtually no limit to the number of small devices that are available. The issue is that these devices need to be kept charged. Currently, the best way to do this away from a power outlet is either with a traditional gas generator, devices like solar chargers, or simply more batteries. There are other devices on the market which have a similar operating principle as this device, though these products still have shortcomings.</p>
<p>The issue with other devices is that they are heavy, cumbersome to use, may not work while on the move, and (in the case of things like solar chargers) simply do not work in all situations.</p>
<p>Our portable power generator is designed to work on the move. For equal performance, it is lighter than any of these other commonly available power solutions. It is small, compact, and safe to use. The generator uses commonly available bottle fuels, such as those used in small camping stoves, making it accessible and affordable.</p>
<p>This portable power generator can be used by the military to charge radios, GPS units, laptops, or any other small electronic device in the field. Emergency services and disaster relief can benefit from this device as grid power is typically unavailable and mobility is key. This generator can even be used in the home or for recreational applications. Keeping phones charged in power outages or during vacations or camping trips, this device is discrete when you don't need it but always ready whenever you do.</p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We are aiming to raise $20,000. These funds will be used in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>$7,500 to manufacture the five full-scale, full-function prototypes with some budgeted for replacement parts if needed</li>
<li>$5,000 for professional electronics and circuit consultation, testing, and manufacturing</li>
<li>$2,500 for required equipment - tools, sensors, data loggers</li>
<li>$2,500 for PR and hands-on testing with real users</li>
<li>$2,500 to fulfill campaign perks and for unforeseen misc. expenses</li>
</ul>
<h3>Development Schedule</h3>
<p>Our current timeline looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>June 22: Indiegogo campaign begins</li>
<li>August 1: Indiegogo campaign has ended, short wait for funds to be distributed</li>
<li>August 14: (approx.) orders placed for parts manufacture  and equipment</li>
<li>August 14 - September 1: Fulfillment of Indiegogo perks</li>
<li>September 1: Final assembly of prototypes begins and testing commences ASAP with design iterations occurring simultaneously</li>
<li>January 1: Testing is concluded and the product will be made market ready</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a tentative timeline and is subject to change. We will work as quickly as we can and keep everyone involved updated to our progress.</p>
<h3>The Challenges</h3>
<p>Money is the number one challenge. Funding the project on a limited budget has led to delays in parts acquisition and manufacturing. Funding will alleviate many issues with and speed up product development.</p>
<p>Another major challenge is our inability to accurately take temperature or power measurements over time. Being able to see how the device performs while left running is critical. A portion of the funds is set aside to purchase temperature sensors and multimeters with logging functions.</p>
<p>The last major challenge is circuit design. We require a control circuit to regulate power generated by the device. This circuit must be as lightweight and efficient as possible to maximize power to weight of the device. As a result, expert circuit design by a trained professional is a necessity.</p>
<h3>Your Help</h3>
<p>A functioning prototype has already been built and a full-scale, full-function version has already been designed and is ready for immediate production. We have funded this project thus far completely out of our own pockets. This campaign is raising funds to move forward with proper testing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are not able to put this product up for pre-sale at the moment. With your help, we will be able to reach that point more quickly. Our perks are intended as a token of our appreciation and to show that we are serious about getting this product and our name out there.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cant help financially, then help spread the word! Everything helps.</p>
<p>Feedback is always appreciated. If you have questions or comments, feel free to contact me either through</p>

</ul>Don't worry about being blunt, I really want to hear your thoughts.<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Campaign Result</h3>Once we reach our funding goal we can move forward with prototyping and testing. These tests will determine actual performance parameters for the device and indicate whether any modifications need to be made to the design.<p></p>
<p>These campaign funds are enough to complete the testing phase of this device. Once this is complete, we can move on with full scale production and marketing.</p>

Don't worry about being blunt, I really want to hear your thoughts.

Campaign ResultOnce we reach our funding goal we can move forward with prototyping and testing. These tests will determine actual performance parameters for the device and indicate whether any modifications need to be made to the design.
These campaign funds are enough to complete the testing phase of this device. Once this is complete, we can move on with full scale production and marketing.


Thank you!

Varroa is a viruses' vector, hence without Varroa a colony is also much healthier and less exposed to viruses. The BeeEthic electronic control unit applies automatic treatment monthly. It also help bees to maintain the ideal temperature in the brood (95°F; 35°C) making it less dependent on climate variability.This method is 100% effective, as certified by the Italian Ministry of Environment, after 6 years of testing by the Perugia University (Italy).  BeeEthic has exceeded expectations thanks to the strong contributions of a team of engineers, researchers and beekeepers. In our research we have found out that by keeping the Varroa population under a certain level, bees improve honey production as they enjoy better health.RESULTS (six years research by Perugia University)
NO SIDE-EFFECTS, NO QUEEN CASUALTIES
80% EFFICIENCY IN KILLING VARROA MITES
VIRUS SPREAD REDUCTION
BROOD DISEASES' REDUCTION
INCREASING IN HONEY PRODUCTION up to 30%
SAVING BEEKEEPERS' WORK up to 50%
PRESERVING HONEY RESERVES THROUGHOUT THE SEASON
 Media reports:        Main Partners:                Varroa mites are threatening the very bees' survival worldwide. Colony Collapse Disorder is killing bees at scaring rates and our system is the solution to save bees and mankind with them...as man cannot live without bees!The BeeEthic system applies heat within the hive. Varroa mites are sensitive to high temperatures and they cannot survive to temperatures higher than 108 F (42°C). This is an automatic system that does not require any manual application and enables beekeepers to get rid of dangerous chemical products to kill Varroa.The ""brain"" of the BeeEthic system is an electronic control unit which applies anti-Varroa treatments when they are needed. It also help bees to control the brood temperature, expecially during rapid variations due to climate irregularities.Varroa mites reproductive cycle is much faster than the bees' reproductive cycle, making Varroa very aggressive. In one season a whole colony can be destroyed by Varroa, as shown in the graph below.Up to today, Varroa has been killed only with strong chemical products which damage also bees and leave residues in the bees' products. Varroa adapts quickly to chemical remedies which has to be strengthened yearly to be effective. All solutions that aremarginally effective are either highly toxic or illegal, because of their hazard to animal and human health.Bee ethic - Test of efficacy​ Research OutlightsMany studies show the thermal treatment's effectiveness. This is the only treatment certified as 100% effective, following a five year study by the Tubingen University (Germany). Tubingen inserted honeycombs into special ovens with a laborious process which makes it not easy to be used by beekeepers.Varroa reproduction takes place in bee broods. About 80% of Varroa lives in the brood, with the remaining 20% traveling attached to the bees (phoretic Varroa).  Chemical treatments are successful mostly on the phoretic Varroa. With the exception of the formic acid which can kill the Varroa also inside the brood. This has massive side-effects on bees, though. Normally, beekeepers uses ossalic acid, which is also admitted for organically-certified honey as it does not have strong residues. However, its application is labor-intensive as up to ten treatments per season are necessary.  After 6 years of field research and testing in cooperation with university, expert beekeepers and clients, we did not come across any side-effect of the BeeEthic sytem,  which destroys Varroa mite during its reproduction cycle, avoiding its dangerous demographic explosion.  With automatically repeated treatments throughout the season (at every brood incubation), newborn bees are healthier!By removing around 80% of the Varroa from the brood, we lowers the risk of viruses which are carried by the Varroa mite (DWV, ABV, IAPV, KBV CBPV, etc.)With a constant temperature in the hive, controlled by the BeeEthic system, we reduce honey self-consumption by the bees. In fact, over half of the honey produced in a hive, is needed by bees to  production is needed to maintain the ideal temperature of 95 F and support healthy bees.With evident effects of climate change, challenges to the bees have become formidable. BeeEthic helps maintaining a constant temperature in the honeycomb, avoiding several problems, such as  COOLED BROOD, CALCIFIED BROOD, FUNGUS, MAL DI MAGGIO, DYSENTERY, MAL NERO, etc. 
Research Results obtained in 2013 The initial research was carried out in collaboration with the Beekeepers Cooperative in Gubbio Italy and the Perugia University. It resulted in a 70% mortality rate of the Varroa mite after a single treatment which took place on five hives at the end of August 2013. This was a great result as efficiency was higher than any other product in the market, which were tested in control units.Applied Research Results Obtained in 2014In 2014, our research covered 100 hives, making it a scientific relevant sample. The treatment resulted in the destruction of experimentation 80% of Varroa mites! Results were certified by the Perugia University and the Italian Ministry of Environment. A result much stronger than expected!BeeEthic hitting the market in 2015BeeEthic was marketed in 2015 and so far it is been used by more then 100 beekeepers worldwide. Many of them are making plans to expand the system to their whole apiary!!!In 2017 we develop our software to apply the treatment automatically.  We care about our clients, whom we know personally and we consider friends. We did then upgrade the new software to all the systems already sold.In January 2017, at the ABF Conference in Houston TX, we launched the Langstroth frame for the US market.Currently, the company produces and sells:1) Hive kits to install in an existing Dadant or Langstroth hives2) Complete BeeEthic hives (with a Control Unit every 5 hives, powered by the grid, a solar system or a fuel engine, supporting also nomadism)About 1,000 BeeEthic hives have already been installed throughout the world to full satisfactions of our friends bee-keepers. With the funding we are collecting in this campaign, we will upgrade the BeeEthic System to:BeeEthic 2.0 - 2017The BeeEthic 2.0 system is connected to the BeeEthic cloud, enabling beekeepers to get access on their smartphones to their hives' information, including the brood temperature, the anti-Varroa treatments schedule. Beekeepers will also have the possibility to start manually a treatment over the phone, if they deem it necessary. BeeEthic TestimonialsDr. Tiziano Gardi, Perugia University, Head of the Research Team:""The research was carried out in collaboration with F.A.I. (Italian Beekeepers Federation ) and the Beekeepers Cooperative from Gubbio-Gualdo for the past 5 years, during which we perfected the system, which has given good results. Three students did their graduation thesis on this research and every year we keep improving the system"". Dr. Marco Porporato, Researcher, Turin University""Today we discovered this wonderful initiative promoted by BeeEthic, with their system that uses heat therapy to reduce the Varroa population breeding in the colony, I think it is a great innovation in the beekeeping scene, surely it will be favorably received by beekeepers"" Dr. Aulo Manino, Turin University ""I am familiar with the heat treatment method, but infortunatelly it presents serious technical difficulties. BeeEthic is a new device that addresses many of the problems that so far prevented the use of the heat treatment. Therefore it represents a turning point in the implementation of this methodology to fight Varroa"" Dr. Annalisa Balloi - Researcher and CEO of Micro4You""Micro4You and BeeEthic have been working togheter for several years and during this period I was able to appreciate the effectivenees and innovative aspects of this method that I'm sure will lead to a revolution in beekeeping with positive ripercussions throughout the entire agribusiness sector""   Some of our Clients: Don Mario Beekeeping -  Lugano, Switzerland""Sixt months ago I've seen a BeeEthic advertisement and I've bought the system for 10 colonies. Now we are at the end of the season. I have opened the BeeEthic hives and I can conclude that they are the best in my 100-hive apiary!  To me the system works very well and I will buy it again, because for us what is important is the Bee!"" Mr. Federico Fusco, BeeEthic Beekeeper from 2015 - Italy""I approached the BeeEthic world a bit by chance and slowly I used this technology a bit like a trial... and I have to say that - from this year - after a first year with a bit of uncertainty - I had the first results from the 4 BeeEthic colonies. They look very well. They have passed the Winter and now they are the best of my apiary! I'm expanding the BeeEthic apiary, doubling it from last year"" Adi Apicoltura, Large Beekeeping Company in Tornareccio since 1858 - Italy""We are an historical company established in 1858 by my grandfather. We are organic beekeeper since 1999 and this led us to try this new opportunity to fight Varroa. We saw Varroa mites dying. I wish you to secceed in making your product lighter and simpler because it is still a bit complex"" Beekeeping Giannini, Large Beekeeping Company in San Marino

""I have been professional beekeeper for more then 30 years, I own about 1,000 hives. I always had problem with Varroa and I wanted to try new solutions. I use Ossalic acid and Apivar. Sometimes I have also blocked the queens but this is very complex as I have many hives.  BeeEthic impressed me! The first 5 test BeeEthic hives, after the first season, are beautiful, without using any chemicals. I then bought another 14 hives and I intend to expand the presence of BeeEthic in my apiary because I am fed up with so many chemical treatments.""
 Beekeeping Rohrwacher - Professional Organic Bekeeper, with Bee ethic from 2015 - Italy ""I have been a beekeeper for  many years, since long time I have chosen to fight Varroa with methods approved under certified organic beekeeping. The main problem is the adaptation of the Varroa mite to whatever chemical substance we use. BeeEthic enables beekeepers to treat bees all year round, even doing the production period. The treatment is efficient as we can observe within the brood comb several dead mites. I'm certain that this will be the future!"" Other Thermal Treatment TechnologiesThe competitive advantage of the BeeEthic system is the integration of the thermic treatment within the hive as compared to treating honeycombs in ovens. This  makes the treatment simple and effective also for inexperienced beekeepers. BeeEthic is substantially less labor-intensive compare to the chemical treatments available in the market. It guarantees that all bee products (honey, propolis, royal jelly, wax, pollen, poison) are fully natural and organic!Other thermic systems in the market are not even close to the results obtained by BeeEthic!

<p><i>In our travels we have witnessed whole families working in landfills, dump sites, and trash heaps, salvaging what they deemed of value, just to survive; exposing themselves to harmful elements, and therefore, endangering their health and safety. With our units, we hope to eliminate that danger by creating a cleaner, healthier environment for all of us; and in doing so, create jobs so fewer people will need to resort to such a way of life.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>Hello,</i></strong> I’m Gene Sawyer, the CEO &amp; President of BOSS Alliance LLC. which is an energy solutions partner with Dynamis Energy. Since 2012, we have explored and found ways to convert trash, primarily municipal solid waste (MSW), to energy (electricity &amp; heat); therefore reducing environmental, economic, and social landfill disposal issues. </p>
<p>BOSS Alliance has vetted  many Waste to Energy companies that claimed they had ""the"" solution for Waste to Energy. After visiting Dynamis Energy’s corporate offices and test site, we were accepted as a team partner. As an Independent Agent, we represent the Dynamis Energy technology. The last 4 years we’ve introduced and promoted the Dynamis Energy Waste to Energy technology domestically, and to several other countries. We have faced many challenges in the Waste to Energy development program, and one of the biggest has been in being able to show interested parties a “Live Demonstration” of the Waste to Energy technology in operation, without our clients traveling to the Dynamis test facility in Idaho. Dynamis Energy has agreed that, with a successful campaign funding program, they will modify the ""Waste Station"", and build for us a <u>Mobile Demonstration Unit. </u></p>
<p>With the MDU, we will be able to demonstrate the complete waste to energy process to large groups that would not otherwise have the ability to experience a demonstration. We will demonstrate the Waste to Energy process at the host location, from loading the waste, to demonstrating the developed electrical energy.</p>
<p>The  Mobile Demonstration Unit (<strong>MDU</strong>) is designed as a fully operational  Waste to Energy (<strong>WTE</strong>) demonstration tool to visually demonstrate the gasification of waste and production of heat and power. </p>
<p>The <strong>MDU</strong> operates under the same engineering principles as a full scale waste to energy gasification facility. The <strong>WTE</strong> Dynamis proprietary process of 'controlled gasification', is a process without flame, utilizing heat to convert municipal solid waste to syngas, primarily methane (natural gas) and other flammable gases 'syngas', then utilizing the syngas in a clean combustion  to steam process making electrical power.""</p>
<p>The Dynamis technology uses large Primary gasification chambers to process batches of mixed feedstock sources during each 14 to 16 hour cycle. If it is organic and fits into the chamber, it can be gasified. After the cycle is completed, ash is removed, collected, and can be reused as an additive for concrete. The SynGas produced by the Primary passes onto the Secondary Chamber where it is thoroughly mixed with air and ignited to combust all of the organic carbon based gases prior to exiting the exhaust flue. With the heat generated by the Secondary Chamber, it can produce steam to drive a turbine and generate electricity, or send as Process Steam. It can also be used to heat water and/or drive absorption chillers to make chilled or refrigerated water for other processes. The system is highly modular and expandable from 30 tons per day to 1800 tpd.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of the  many challenges that we found to develope the sale of a Full Scale Waste To Energy facility,the following solutions for are just a few:</p>
<ul><li>
<strong><i>Challenge:</i></strong> Getting all the necessary decision makers in the same place at the same time.</li></ul>
<p><strong><i>       S</i><i>olution:</i></strong>    With the MDU, we can now go to them.</p>
<ul><li>
<strong><i>Challenge:</i></strong>  Being able to demonstrate the technology in operation. </li></ul>
<p><strong><i>       Solution:</i></strong>     With the MDU, it would be like taking a 'test drive'.</p>
<ul><li>
<strong><i>Challenge:</i></strong>  Making the presentation of the technology understandable. </li></ul>
<p><strong><i>       Solution:</i></strong>     With a <i>live</i> demonstration, potential clients get their questions answered on the spot.</p>
<p><u><strong>With YOUR help, we will lead the world to:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Convert trash into clean 'Green Energy'.</li>
<li>Clean up and minimize landfill operations.</li>
<li>Protect the environment.</li>
<li>Save and protect our land, air and waters.</li>
<li>Reduce the output of 'Greenhouse Gases'.</li>
<li>Produce clean, reliable, renewable power.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Dynamis we have a  scaleable Waste to Energy solution, and with the Mobile Demonstration Unit as a demonstration tool, we're able to promote full scale Waste to Energy facilities. Our campaign efforts will initially be centered upon Central and South Americas, where urban centers are highly populated, and waste disposal technology is lacking current US standards.   </p>
<p>With the flexibility of moving the <strong>MDU</strong> from one demonstration site to the next, we are planning 4 different site demonstrations within the first year, and up to 8 demonstrations the second year.  We have the knowledge, the technology and the potential clients; now what we need is your help...Your contributions will help us to make <strong>Clean - Green - Renewable -Energy</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Progress:</strong></p>
<p>We have completed several major steps along  our Campaign/Program path, including the signing of important documents:  </p>
<ul>
<li>'Independent Agency Agreements' with Dynamis Energy</li>
<li>Memorandum of Understanding with the country of Peru.</li>
<li>Pre feasibility study questionnaires completed and returned to us for project evaluation from several countries</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we need to take our program to the next funding level to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase the MDU</li>
<li>Fund and train the operators &amp; staff</li>
<li>Fund program transportation costs</li>
<li>Fund the MDU operation for one full year to ensure success  </li>
</ul>
<p>We will host live demonstrations of the Dynamis Energy 'Waste to Energy' technology for the:</p>
<ul>
<li>Municipalities</li>
<li>Landfill Operators</li>
<li>Waste Managers</li>
<li>Industrialists</li>
<li>Manufacturers</li>
</ul>
<p>Clients<b><i> </i></b>will have full access to our team to assist with their decision to approve of the installation of full scale Waste to Energy facilities. The cities, states and countries will be able to take control of the trash, reduce pollution of air, water and soil, and develop a ""true waste management"" program.</p>
<p>Our goal is that by the end of the <i><strong>second</strong></i> year of demonstrating with the <strong>MDU: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>that Dynamis Energy will have several full scale, 250 to 1000 tons per day Waste to Energy facilities under contract</li>
<li>that new jobs will have been created by these new facilities</li>
<li>that existing landfill employees will have been retrained by the Waste to Energy companies</li>
<li>that awareness will have further spread as to the importance of proper Waste Management</li>
</ul>
<p>After <strong>2 years</strong> of demonstrations, BOSS Alliance will be <strong>donating</strong> to a <strong><i>nonprofit</i></strong> hospital complex within the region, the <strong>MDU</strong> modified by Dynamis Energy into a <i>fixed location</i> <strong>Waste to Energy System</strong> for processing site-generated medical and other waste into <strong>Clean Energy</strong>. </p>
<p>To select the nonprofit hospital complex, we will publish and send out a <i><strong>'Request for Qualification'</strong></i>  to the regional hospital complex's and create a ballot with the information from the RFQ. The <i>Starred </i>(Gold Star, Platinum Star and Diamond Star) funding members can then vote the hospital of their choice. The hospital with the highest amount of votes will receive the modified unit. The hospital installation will be within 6 months of issuance of permits. The <i>Starred</i> Contributors will have their names listed on the attached plaque of ""Appreciation"" from the winning hospital, and also the <i>Starred</i> contributors will be invited to attend that celebration.</p>
<p>Additionally, our <i>Starred</i><strong><i> </i></strong>funders will have the opportunity to participate as hosted guests at an <i><strong>MDU Demonstration</strong>,</i>  or of a full scale <i><strong>Waste to</strong></i> <strong><i>Energy Facility</i></strong> <i><strong>Commissioning</strong></i>  and 3 to7 day vacations, depending on their level of contribution. </p>

Depending on your level of contribution, there are hats, shirts, vacations and  the opportunity to visit and see a demonstration first hand, attend a ribbon cutting ceremony or a donation celebration.* Contributors of all levels will have their names on a letter of recognition. In addition, all contributors will receive a monthly digital newsletter of the Campaign's progress. We're thinking that you'll find your greatest perk is in the knowledge that your contribution has advanced the <strong>WTE</strong> technology creating <strong>""Clean-Green-Renewable-Energy"".</strong></p>
<p>Of course, we are also hoping that these gifts will contribute to your spreading the word about what we're doing and how you are helping us with our goals; therefore encouraging others to help us and do what they can, also making this a healthier and cleaner world.  </p>
<p>Not everyone can financially contribute, we understand that, but you can help us by just clicking on the <strong>share</strong> button; sharing our mission with your family friends and work colleagues. You can find all the quick tools to do this here on the Indiegogo website and also through our <strong>media pages</strong> on Facebook. We believe that by people helping people we can see each other's dreams and missions come to reality.</p>
<p>(*see below at  <strong>Perk Experience &amp; Vacation Management</strong> )</p>
<p><strong>Why This Is So Important to Us</strong></p>
<p>This project is of great importance to us and for our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. We've watched as the population has grown, and waste products along with it. We've seen (and smelled) the landfills everywhere we go. We have suffered the pain of high energy bills, and watched our beautiful oceans, air and streams fill with pollution. We want to help. We want our descendants to have clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, swim or fish in. Our dream is to give them a healthier environment now, so that when the time comes that we aren't around, we can leave this life with the knowledge that we left things a little better for them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The campaign is based upon BOSS Alliance's  <strong>Mobile </strong><b>Demonstration</b> program and teaming with Dynamis Energy to create more <strong>full scale</strong> Waste to Energy facilities around the world. Each facility will generate Green Renewable power, reduce Greenhouse gasses, and help protect our precious waters, air and land.  </p>
<p>We chose the ""Flexible Funding"" plan because we will be able to live into our mission of assisting in the expansion of a <strong><i>""Better Waste Management</i></strong> <strong>Solution""</strong>. Once we reach <strong>35%</strong> or more of the program budget we will be able to place the order &amp; purchase the Mobile Demonstration Unit from Dynamis, and during the design and manufacturing period, pursue additional funding to fulfill our demonstration program.  </p>
<p> </p>

<div style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></u></div> <div>
<p><strong>What is Waste to Energy?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Waste to energy is a process where facilities use waste in order to create power or electricity. The national focus on developing renewable energy sources has resulted in increased interest in developing waste to energy facilities.</p>
<p><strong> What happens to my garbage at a waste  to energy facility?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">After your hauler picks up your garbage, the hauler delivers it to a waste-to-energy facility where it is fed directly into gasification chambers and used to create electricity or steam. Emissions are carefully controlled and monitored to limit air pollution. Ash from the combustion of the garbage is managed in a landfill. Only 5% of the volume of your original garbage becomes ash, the rest becomes energy.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;""><strong>What are the environmental benefits of Waste to Energy?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:44pt;"">A source of renewable energy</li>
<li style=""margin-left:44pt;"">Reduces greenhouse gas emissions</li>
<li style=""margin-left:44pt;"">Supports recycling</li>
<li style=""margin-left:44pt;"">Keeps our waters clean</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> What are some other advantages and benefits of Waste to Energy?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:44pt;"">Removing and recycling materials from trash that were not separated at the home or business.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:44pt;"">Our 3.0 technology processes the trash to make is non-hazardous, non-infectious and less harmful to humans and the environment.</li>
<li style=""margin-left:44pt;"">Reducing the volume of the waste requiring final disposal, if any, thereby reducing the amount of land needed for landfills.                                                                                                                                        </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How does Waste to Energy reduce greenhouse gases?</strong></p>
<p><strong> ​</strong>When solid waste decomposes, it creates methane which is 20 times more potent than Co2 in    terms of its impact on greenhouse gas production and global warming. Our waste to energy    facilities eliminate that production of methane and destroys virtually all CO2 thereby reducing  the emission of greenhouse gases substantially.</p>
<p><strong>How does burning garbage in a waste to energy facility compare to using a burn barrel?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;"">To begin with, the Dynamis 3.0 technology, does not technically burn garbage, it is combusted through a proprietary process of controlled gasification without flame. Burn barrels or open pit burning do so at low temperatures and are extremely polluting. Burning waste is estimated to be the largest source of dioxins, a very toxic and carcinogenic group of pollutants. Just one family using a backyard burn barrel will emit more dioxins per year than a 200 ton per day waste to energy facility.  Our facilities are well below all jurisdictions limits on dioxin emissions.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;""><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Do waste to energy facilities adversely affect recycling rates? </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;"">Concerns have been expressed about the impact of waste-to-energy facilities on recycling rates—that waste to energy acts as a disincentive to recycling. European countries and US communities that rely heavily on waste-to-energy to manage solid waste also have higher recycling rates than those communities without waste to energy facilities. In fact, communities with waste-to-energy facilities have an average recycling rate of 33% as compared with the national average of 28%.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Are waste-to-energy facilities significant generators of greenhouse gases? </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;"">Dynamis 3.0 technology waste-to-energy facilities provide a much lower carbon alternative to landfills. Decomposition of solid waste in landfills produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is over 20 times more effective in trapping heat in the atmosphere than an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. Waste-to-energy facilities produce no methane and overall lower carbon dioxide emissions per ton of waste disposed or combusted than landfills. However, the level of carbon benefit is affected by the distance the solid waste is transported and the mode of transportation that is utilized. Waste-to- energy facilities also recover ferrous and non-ferrous metals that are not ordinarily recovered by residential curbside recycling programs. Recovery and reuse of these materials can save on average 75 percent of the energy needed to produce the same amount of virgin steel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will be done to monitor and control the odors at the facility?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:44pt;"">Traffic patterns for trucks entering and exiting the facility will be identical to the current traffic pattern because the facility is to be located at the landfill site.</li>

<p><strong>Are waste-to-energy facilities safe for the environment?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:8pt;"">Yes. 'Waste-to-energy facilities produce electricity with ―less environmental impact than almost any other source of electricity,' according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.' ―EPA recognizes the vital role of the nation’s municipal waste-to-energy industry,' wrote former EPA Administrator Marianne Lamont Horinko, and Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, Jeffrey Holmstead. Waste-to-energy facilities are a '―clean, reliable, renewable source of energy.'</p>
<p>Waste-to-energy technology prevents the emission of eleven million metric tons of greenhouse gases (methane and carbon dioxide) that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere on   an annual basis. In addition, waste-to-energy serves as an alternative to land disposal and   power generation from fossil fuels, which prevents the release of more than 20,000 tons of nitrogen oxides and 2.2 million tons of volatile organic compounds.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why have so few new waste-to-energy plants been built in the last ten years?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;"">Waste-to-energy facilities rely on revenue from waste disposal and energy sales. Over the past ten years, the price of land disposal has been low, providing stiff competition. In addition, the price of electricity had also been low. But times are changing. The high cost of electricity, combined with the elevated fuel costs of hauling trash to distant landfills has communities considering waste-to-energy once again. In addition, there has been a renewed focus on the environmental issues as well as developing renewable energy sources.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is waste-to-energy a renewable energy source?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;"">Yes. Waste-to-energy is renewable because its main fuel source---garbage---is sustainable and non-depletable.  According to the U.S. EPA, waste-to-energy is a ―clean, reliable, renewable source of energy.‖ In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the Federal Power Act, the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, the Biomass Research and Development Act of 2000, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s regulations, and fifteen states all recognize waste-to-energy power as renewable.</p>
</div> <p><strong>Is the ash from waste-to-energy plants safe?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;"">Yes, ash residue from waste-to-energy facilities is tested in accordance with strict state and federal leaching tests and is consistently shown to be safe for land disposal and reuse. Waste-to-energy reduces the volume of trash by about 90%, resulting in a 90% decrease in the amount of land required for garbage disposal. Ash also exhibits concrete-like properties causing it to harden once it is placed and compacted in a landfill, reducing the potential for rainwater to leach contaminants from ash landfills into the ground.  It also has beneficial use in concrete plants, can be used to build roads, or concrete blocks for building or landscaping.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Dynamis 3.0 technology and gasification?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;"">Our state of the art 3.0 technology of gasification is a process that converts carbonaceous materials, such as coal, biomass, or municipal solid waste (garbage) into carbon monoxide and hydrogen by reacting the raw material at high temperatures with a controlled amount of oxygen. The resulting gas mixture is called synthesis gas or syngas and is itself a fuel.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;"">Gasification is a very efficient method for extracting energy from many different types of organic materials, and also has applications as a clean waste disposal technique. The advantage of gasification is that using the syngas is more efficient than direct combustion of the original fuel; more of the energy contained in the fuel is extracted. Gasification of fossil fuels is currently widely used on industrial scales to generate electricity. However, almost any type of organic material can be used as the raw material for gasification, such as wood, biomass, or even plastic waste. Thus, gasification is an important technology for renewable energy. Of particular importance is the fact that biomass gasification is carbon neutral.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the Dynamis 3.0 technology gasifications main advantages?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:8.0pt;"">Gasification is one of the cleanest power systems available today. There are four main advantages or benefits of gasification technology.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Feedstock flexibility </strong>– Gasification can produce syngas not only from garbage having a wide range of heat values but also from other feedstocks such as petroleum coke, high-sulfur fuel oil,municipal waste,biomass, tires, medical waste and coal etc. This flexibility the economic value of these resources and lowers costs by providing industry with a broader range of feedstock options.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>​Product flexibility -</strong><strong>  </strong>The syngas produced by gasification in our plant will be converted into steam and electricity but there are many other valuable products, ranging from liquid fuels, basic chemicals, and hydrogen.Integration of multiple gasification products  into industrial applications increases opportunities for added revenues since plant operations can focus on the most lucrative products, provides economies of scale associated with production of multiple commodities and increases opportunities for added revenues.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> <strong>Near - zero emissions - </strong>Gasification systems can meet the strictest environmental regulations pertaining to emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter, and toxic compounds. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>High efficiency - </strong>Gasification can be integrated with other technologies for advanced power generation, particularly combustion turbines.

Hello, I’m Gene Sawyer, the CEO & President of BOSS Alliance LLC. which is an energy solutions partner with Dynamis Energy. Since 2012, we have explored and found ways to convert trash, primarily municipal solid waste (MSW), to energy (electricity & heat); therefore reducing environmental, economic, and social landfill disposal issues. 
BOSS Alliance has vetted  many Waste to Energy companies that claimed they had ""the"" solution for Waste to Energy. After visiting Dynamis Energy’s corporate offices and test site, we were accepted as a team partner. As an Independent Agent, we represent the Dynamis Energy technology. The last 4 years we’ve introduced and promoted the Dynamis Energy Waste to Energy technology domestically, and to several other countries. We have faced many challenges in the Waste to Energy development program, and one of the biggest has been in being able to show interested parties a “Live Demonstration” of the Waste to Energy technology in operation, without our clients traveling to the Dynamis test facility in Idaho. Dynamis Energy has agreed that, with a successful campaign funding program, they will modify the ""Waste Station"", and build for us a Mobile Demonstration Unit. 
With the MDU, we will be able to demonstrate the complete waste to energy process to large groups that would not otherwise have the ability to experience a demonstration. We will demonstrate the Waste to Energy process at the host location, from loading the waste, to demonstrating the developed electrical energy.
The  Mobile Demonstration Unit (MDU) is designed as a fully operational  Waste to Energy (WTE) demonstration tool to visually demonstrate the gasification of waste and production of heat and power. 
The MDU operates under the same engineering principles as a full scale waste to energy gasification facility. The WTE Dynamis proprietary process of 'controlled gasification', is a process without flame, utilizing heat to convert municipal solid waste to syngas, primarily methane (natural gas) and other flammable gases 'syngas', then utilizing the syngas in a clean combustion  to steam process making electrical power.""
The Dynamis technology uses large Primary gasification chambers to process batches of mixed feedstock sources during each 14 to 16 hour cycle. If it is organic and fits into the chamber, it can be gasified. After the cycle is completed, ash is removed, collected, and can be reused as an additive for concrete. The SynGas produced by the Primary passes onto the Secondary Chamber where it is thoroughly mixed with air and ignited to combust all of the organic carbon based gases prior to exiting the exhaust flue. With the heat generated by the Secondary Chamber, it can produce steam to drive a turbine and generate electricity, or send as Process Steam. It can also be used to heat water and/or drive absorption chillers to make chilled or refrigerated water for other processes. The system is highly modular and expandable from 30 tons per day to 1800 tpd.
 
Of the  many challenges that we found to develope the sale of a Full Scale Waste To Energy facility,the following solutions for are just a few:

Challenge: Getting all the necessary decision makers in the same place at the same time.
       Solution:    With the MDU, we can now go to them.

Challenge:  Being able to demonstrate the technology in operation. 
       Solution:     With the MDU, it would be like taking a 'test drive'.

Challenge:  Making the presentation of the technology understandable. 
       Solution:     With a live demonstration, potential clients get their questions answered on the spot.
With YOUR help, we will lead the world to:

Convert trash into clean 'Green Energy'.
Clean up and minimize landfill operations.
Protect the environment.
Save and protect our land, air and waters.
Reduce the output of 'Greenhouse Gases'.
Produce clean, reliable, renewable power.

With Dynamis we have a  scaleable Waste to Energy solution, and with the Mobile Demonstration Unit as a demonstration tool, we're able to promote full scale Waste to Energy facilities. Our campaign efforts will initially be centered upon Central and South Americas, where urban centers are highly populated, and waste disposal technology is lacking current US standards.   
With the flexibility of moving the MDU from one demonstration site to the next, we are planning 4 different site demonstrations within the first year, and up to 8 demonstrations the second year.  We have the knowledge, the technology and the potential clients; now what we need is your help...Your contributions will help us to make Clean - Green - Renewable -Energy.
 
Our Progress:
We have completed several major steps along  our Campaign/Program path, including the signing of important documents:  

'Independent Agency Agreements' with Dynamis Energy
Memorandum of Understanding with the country of Peru.
Pre feasibility study questionnaires completed and returned to us for project evaluation from several countries

Now we need to take our program to the next funding level to:

Purchase the MDU
Fund and train the operators & staff
Fund program transportation costs
Fund the MDU operation for one full year to ensure success  

We will host live demonstrations of the Dynamis Energy 'Waste to Energy' technology for the:

Municipalities
Landfill Operators
Waste Managers
Industrialists
Manufacturers

Clients will have full access to our team to assist with their decision to approve of the installation of full scale Waste to Energy facilities. The cities, states and countries will be able to take control of the trash, reduce pollution of air, water and soil, and develop a ""true waste management"" program.
Our goal is that by the end of the second year of demonstrating with the MDU: 

that Dynamis Energy will have several full scale, 250 to 1000 tons per day Waste to Energy facilities under contract
that new jobs will have been created by these new facilities
that existing landfill employees will have been retrained by the Waste to Energy companies
that awareness will have further spread as to the importance of proper Waste Management

After 2 years of demonstrations, BOSS Alliance will be donating to a nonprofit hospital complex within the region, the MDU modified by Dynamis Energy into a fixed location Waste to Energy System for processing site-generated medical and other waste into Clean Energy. 
To select the nonprofit hospital complex, we will publish and send out a 'Request for Qualification'  to the regional hospital complex's and create a ballot with the information from the RFQ. The Starred (Gold Star, Platinum Star and Diamond Star) funding members can then vote the hospital of their choice. The hospital with the highest amount of votes will receive the modified unit. The hospital installation will be within 6 months of issuance of permits. The Starred Contributors will have their names listed on the attached plaque of ""Appreciation"" from the winning hospital, and also the Starred contributors will be invited to attend that celebration.
Additionally, our Starred funders will have the opportunity to participate as hosted guests at an MDU Demonstration,  or of a full scale Waste to Energy Facility Commissioning  and 3 to7 day vacations, depending on their level of contribution. 
 
With your contributions we will be able to accomplish all the above goals by:
>>>> Our team visits to municipalities developing site demonstrations.
>>>> Introducing  the Dynamis Energy, ""Waste to Energy technology"" to municipalities, landfill operators, electrical utilities and waste managers.
>>>> Assisting Dynamis to develop full scale Waste to Energy Facilities that:

(*see below at  Perk Experience & Vacation Management )
Why This Is So Important to Us
This project is of great importance to us and for our children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. We've watched as the population has grown, and waste products along with it. We've seen (and smelled) the landfills everywhere we go. We have suffered the pain of high energy bills, and watched our beautiful oceans, air and streams fill with pollution. We want to help. We want our descendants to have clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, swim or fish in. Our dream is to give them a healthier environment now, so that when the time comes that we aren't around, we can leave this life with the knowledge that we left things a little better for them.
 
The campaign is based upon BOSS Alliance's  Mobile Demonstration program and teaming with Dynamis Energy to create more full scale Waste to Energy facilities around the world. Each facility will generate Green Renewable power, reduce Greenhouse gasses, and help protect our precious waters, air and land.  
We chose the ""Flexible Funding"" plan because we will be able to live into our mission of assisting in the expansion of a ""Better Waste Management Solution"". Once we reach 35% or more of the program budget we will be able to place the order & purchase the Mobile Demonstration Unit from Dynamis, and during the design and manufacturing period, pursue additional funding to fulfill our demonstration program.  
 

Once again we invite everyone that is concerned about the future of our Mother Earth to get involved by ""helping us help the world"", now is the time, let's not wait until it's too late. Working together we can make a difference. You will have the opportunity to witness the results of your contribution, whether it be funding or sharing our mission. You will be able to  see the future of proper waste management programs;

DYNAMIS ENERGY 
Full Scale Facility
Frequently Asked Questions: 
What is Waste to Energy?
Waste to energy is a process where facilities use waste in order to create power or electricity. The national focus on developing renewable energy sources has resulted in increased interest in developing waste to energy facilities.
 What happens to my garbage at a waste  to energy facility?
After your hauler picks up your garbage, the hauler delivers it to a waste-to-energy facility where it is fed directly into gasification chambers and used to create electricity or steam. Emissions are carefully controlled and monitored to limit air pollution. Ash from the combustion of the garbage is managed in a landfill. Only 5% of the volume of your original garbage becomes ash, the rest becomes energy.
What are the environmental benefits of Waste to Energy?

A source of renewable energy
Reduces greenhouse gas emissions
Supports recycling
Keeps our waters clean

 What are some other advantages and benefits of Waste to Energy?

Removing and recycling materials from trash that were not separated at the home or business.
Our 3.0 technology processes the trash to make is non-hazardous, non-infectious and less harmful to humans and the environment.
Reducing the volume of the waste requiring final disposal, if any, thereby reducing the amount of land needed for landfills.                                                                                                                                        

How does Waste to Energy reduce greenhouse gases?
 ​When solid waste decomposes, it creates methane which is 20 times more potent than Co2 in    terms of its impact on greenhouse gas production and global warming. Our waste to energy    facilities eliminate that production of methane and destroys virtually all CO2 thereby reducing  the emission of greenhouse gases substantially.
How does burning garbage in a waste to energy facility compare to using a burn barrel?
To begin with, the Dynamis 3.0 technology, does not technically burn garbage, it is combusted through a proprietary process of controlled gasification without flame. Burn barrels or open pit burning do so at low temperatures and are extremely polluting. Burning waste is estimated to be the largest source of dioxins, a very toxic and carcinogenic group of pollutants. Just one family using a backyard burn barrel will emit more dioxins per year than a 200 ton per day waste to energy facility.  Our facilities are well below all jurisdictions limits on dioxin emissions.
Do waste to energy facilities adversely affect recycling rates? 
Concerns have been expressed about the impact of waste-to-energy facilities on recycling rates—that waste to energy acts as a disincentive to recycling. European countries and US communities that rely heavily on waste-to-energy to manage solid waste also have higher recycling rates than those communities without waste to energy facilities. In fact, communities with waste-to-energy facilities have an average recycling rate of 33% as compared with the national average of 28%.


Are waste-to-energy facilities significant generators of greenhouse gases? 
Dynamis 3.0 technology waste-to-energy facilities provide a much lower carbon alternative to landfills. Decomposition of solid waste in landfills produces methane, a greenhouse gas that is over 20 times more effective in trapping heat in the atmosphere than an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. Waste-to-energy facilities produce no methane and overall lower carbon dioxide emissions per ton of waste disposed or combusted than landfills. However, the level of carbon benefit is affected by the distance the solid waste is transported and the mode of transportation that is utilized. Waste-to- energy facilities also recover ferrous and non-ferrous metals that are not ordinarily recovered by residential curbside recycling programs. Recovery and reuse of these materials can save on average 75 percent of the energy needed to produce the same amount of virgin steel.
 
What will be done to monitor and control the odors at the facility?

Traffic patterns for trucks entering and exiting the facility will be identical to the current traffic pattern because the facility is to be located at the landfill site.
Automated doors will be installed at the facility, minimizing the length of time the doors are open.
The facility will have negative air pressure. Fans pull air from the facility, helping to keep odors inside the facility. 
Roadways will be swept and kept clean of debris from trucks.

 
Are waste-to-energy facilities safe for the environment?
Yes. 'Waste-to-energy facilities produce electricity with ―less environmental impact than almost any other source of electricity,' according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.' ―EPA recognizes the vital role of the nation’s municipal waste-to-energy industry,' wrote former EPA Administrator Marianne Lamont Horinko, and Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, Jeffrey Holmstead.

In addition, waste-to-energy serves as an alternative to land disposal and   power generation from fossil fuels, which prevents the release of more than 20,000 tons of nitrogen oxides and 2.2 million tons of volatile organic compounds.
 
Why have so few new waste-to-energy plants been built in the last ten years?
Waste-to-energy facilities rely on revenue from waste disposal and energy sales. Over the past ten years, the price of land disposal has been low, providing stiff competition. In addition, the price of electricity had also been low. But times are changing. The high cost of electricity, combined with the elevated fuel costs of hauling trash to distant landfills has communities considering waste-to-energy once again.

This Mobile Demonstration  campaign will help make a difference in the way trash will be be properly managed and utilized as ""Green - Renewable - Energy"" . We believe that it will also lead to new jobs in the industry. We're excited and committed to making this happen, and we hope that after viewing & reading what we had to say, you will be too!

<h3>Patent Pending:</h3>
<p>We have developed a sustainable solution that collects and processes plastic and waste. We plan to bring our advanced Plasma Enhanced Melter® (PEM) technology to the world’s ocean plastic problem.</p>
<p>Our factory ships will go directly to the heart of the problem, operating in the world’s oceans, river mouths and estuaries; producing valuable synthetic gas from the waste collected, this will be utilised to fuel the boat making it a fully sustainable project.</p>
<p>As prevention and mitigation of the ocean's plastic problem go hand in hand, we have also developed a land based system. This will afford visionary governments and organisations a sustainable, environmentally friendly technology to recycle their by-products and waste into valuable energy and resources such as synthetic gas, liquid fuels and solid aggregates.</p>
<p>Delivered by an expert team, the Ocean Polymers Project offers a unique solution to the environmental crisis we face, that is not only commercially viable but highly profitable. </p>
<p>Taking a holistic approach our model at Ocean Polymers is the only sustainable solution that addresses the 3 pillars of plastic and waste mismanagement and its subsequent pollution and damage in our oceans.</p>
<p>Our three pronged approach:</p>
<p>•Ocean</p>
<p>      Remove and revalue existing waste in the world’s oceans</p>
<p>•River</p>
<p>      Stop waste at river mouths and estuaries before entering the ocean</p>

<h1 align=""center"">SolarBoss: Off-Grid Solar Power can give so much more</h1>
<h2 align=""center"">Use <strong><u>5</u></strong> <u>Times</u> the power!</h2>
<h2 align=""center"">Put your solar to work and use every Watt.</h2>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>We all want modern conveniences: air con, pool, dishwasher, well pump, water heater, washing machine, electric kettle, coffee maker. Then there’s the iron, hairdryer, straighteners and don’t forget the microwave, toaster and coffee maker. What if you live off the grid? You can still have all the appliances, you just need a helping hand.</p>
<h2 align=""center"">One little box to control them all</h2>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588252588/lptihvrglpatu87kdwxe.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Having solar power is great. Often, though, it’s a problem to use all that free energy. Switching things on and off, remembering to spread the load and keeping a constant eye on the weather and the state of the batteries can be laborious and prone to errors.</p>
<p>Here is the answer: Meet SolarBoss.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588252627/wqegmnfnkf3yqiwpwa84.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>SolarBoss switches your electrical devices according to the available sun and the charge of your batteries. Many things don’t need to happen at an exact time of day, some do. SolarBoss makes instant decisions to give you maximum ‘on-time’ for your appliances.</p>
<p>Smart Switches are a product of the Smart Home revolution. They switch your appliances using WiFi and can be automatically or manually controlled. You can have many more modern appliances that you probably thought possible on solar power. Air con, pool and well pumps and water heaters can be stopped while more immediate needs like coffee and microwave are needed and then restarted when the power is ready again. All without needing to plan or rush around switching things.</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588252663/oknlgf9j28qo1rmcty9c.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588252675/wesaqzzyf3bq861h50dh.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588252685/mk9ljalfza1dsiaa4htb.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588252693/ibd2gdapzbskzkhuwdrj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p align=""center"">Sockets and wired adapters</p>
<p>The smart adapters can just plug in between plug and socket or they can be wired in as a permanent fitting.</p>
<p>You can see what’s happening and take control with your smartphone or computer and get lots of information on how your solar power has been used.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588252720/iqkwxqcscaeilc3hzbtu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Smart sockets not only switch things, they also know how much power is being used at any instant. Want to know when the washing cycle has finished? Want to plug in the iron or use that fancy new coffee machine? No problem!</p>
<p>How much of your solar power gets used?</p>
<p>Based on a fairly typical home installation of 3500 watts of solar panels, 700 Ah of batteries and  a daily load of 3 kWh here’s the lost energy…</p>
<p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588252771/uoraodj4uypfb7d7ht2r.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Hope you find that surprising. You could be using 5 times the energy that you use now. This house could use 15 kWh per day. That’s where the power for the air-conditioning, dishwasher, pool heating and more comes from. The missing piece is ‘Control’. SolarBoss ensures that you get the absolute maximum out of your solar investment. (You can follow the web link above the graph and calculate your own. It’s a respected site from the European Commission.)</p>
<h2>Our Early Users Love it.</h2>
<p>John: “We have a pretty typical solar setup. 3000 watts of panels and a 3KW inverter. We always had to be careful to check what was already on before we turned anything else on. This gadget just makes it all automatic and works unseen until you forget it’s there.

<p>Paul: “I never thought that we could consider Air Conditioning on solar power. Now we can be cool in summer and warm in winter. The cooler / heater takes about 900 Watts and comes on and off automatically, using power that would have been wasted. When we put the washing machine on, the air con stops for about 20 minutes as the water heats up and then carries on. It’s magic! We used to start the generator to do the washing, no more! and air con too. Very happy with this as we thought we needed to upgrade our power system to add more stuff. It has saved it’s cost many times over and is completely automatic.”</p>

<h2>What’s in SolarBoss?</h2>
<p>The centre of SolarBoss is a small unit that clips onto your solar battery. It uses hardly any power and measures the battery voltage continuously. It knows when your battery is charging in the mornings and keeps the loads lower till the batteries are topped-up. You can still put the coffee on and microwave breakfast etc but the air con and pool will wait. If the sun goes in and the batteries are starting to drain then SolarBoss reduces the loads. The main unit has a clip to go on your ‘mains’ power cable, just like an energy monitor. This tells SolarBoss how much overall power is being used and prevents your inverter being overloaded. From this, and the battery voltage, SolarBoss knows how much extra power can be used.</p>
<p>SolarBoss uses WiFi. If you have WiFi installed then SolarBoss connects to it and the Smart Switches too. It can also be accessed (with security of course) over the Internet so you can keep an eye on things, and be told if there is a problem from anywhere.  If you don’t have WiFi, SolarBoss can provide its own so that the Smart Switches can talk to it and for your smartphone access too. You won’t get Internet through it though!</p>
<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p>Just unpack and mount the main unit next to your inverter. Clip the ‘mains’ sensor onto the power cable where it leaves the inverter. Clip the power cables to the battery connections, at the inverter if more convenient and the unit will start up and show a steady light until it’s ready. When it flashes slowly it’s asking to be configured by your smartphone or computer. You can connect to the device and go through the simple setup wizard. Next, plug in the smart sockets and they will automatically set themselves up. When each socket is ready it will blink the LED and appear on the web screen to let you know.</p>
<h2>From then till Now: </h2>
<p>It has been an interesting journey over more than 3 years. We investigated a number of technologies and discarded them when better alternatives arose. We wanted to use ‘standard’ hardware wherever possible and found a variant of the hugely popular Raspberry Pi to suit us perfectly. This tiny computer board has lots of power, WiFi and all the interfaces we needed. It also has unmatched software support and we could be confident that the modules we needed were well proven and reliable. We have designed a second board to handle the power and voltage measurement and the clip-on mains power sensor.</p>
<p>One significant challenge was the smartphone interface. It seems a disadvantage to need a special ‘app’ to access SolarBoss and so we have decided to keep all the intelligence in the box. This means that a standard web browser is all you need to access SolarBoss from phone or computer with no special add-ons at all.</p>
<p>We found that the standard Smart Socket software was not up to the task and so we have rewritten this completely. The original software needed a smartphone app to configure and this in turn connects to Far East web servers, something we were not happy with. Our new software is fully self-contained and can be updated if needed ‘over-the-air’ from the main unit if you have an Internet connection.</p>
<h2>Still to do:</h2>
<p>While we are very happy with the hardware and software progress, there’s still much to do. We have finished the main enclosure design have made an initial run. If all goes to plan we will commission injection moulds for higher numbers. Hardware design is complete and initial productions of the PCBs has been successful. There are great plans for extending the connectivity with Alexa, Google Home and others. We will expand the range of Smart Sockets and Switches to work with SolarBoss. We still have final packaging and documentation to finish and we need more work on our website and support / discussion forum. We are also working on more stats on power usage and also on battery condition. We can tell you a lot about how well your solar system is working. There will be downloadable updates when good new stuff is added which we will strive to make as easy as possible. We have a supply chain being formed and have power sockets for US, EU and UK formats. You will receive the sockets based on delivery address or your choice. We firmly believe that the ongoing risks are very low. The system is working very well and the remaining issues are in logistics, packaging and delivery.</p>

</div></div>","SolarBoss: Off-Grid Solar Power can give so much more
Use 5 Times the power!
Put your solar to work and use every Watt.
 
We all want modern conveniences: air con, pool, dishwasher, well pump, water heater, washing machine, electric kettle, coffee maker. Then there’s the iron, hairdryer, straighteners and don’t forget the microwave, toaster and coffee maker. What if you live off the grid? You can still have all the appliances, you just need a helping hand.
One little box to control them all

Having solar power is great. Often, though, it’s a problem to use all that free energy. Switching things on and off, remembering to spread the load and keeping a constant eye on the weather and the state of the batteries can be laborious and prone to errors.
Here is the answer: Meet SolarBoss.

SolarBoss switches your electrical devices according to the available sun and the charge of your batteries. Many things don’t need to happen at an exact time of day, some do. SolarBoss makes instant decisions to give you maximum ‘on-time’ for your appliances.
Smart Switches are a product of the Smart Home revolution. They switch your appliances using WiFi and can be automatically or manually controlled. You can have many more modern appliances that you probably thought possible on solar power. Air con, pool and well pumps and water heaters can be stopped while more immediate needs like coffee and microwave are needed and then restarted when the power is ready again. All without needing to plan or rush around switching things.

Sockets and wired adapters
The smart adapters can just plug in between plug and socket or they can be wired in as a permanent fitting.
You can see what’s happening and take control with your smartphone or computer and get lots of information on how your solar power has been used.

The Smart sockets not only switch things, they also know how much power is being used at any instant. Want to know when the washing cycle has finished? Want to plug in the iron or use that fancy new coffee machine? No problem!
How much of your solar power gets used?
Based on a fairly typical home installation of 3500 watts of solar panels, 700 Ah of batteries and  a daily load of 3 kWh here’s the lost energy…

Hope you find that surprising. You could be using 5 times the energy that you use now. This house could use 15 kWh per day. That’s where the power for the air-conditioning, dishwasher, pool heating and more comes from. The missing piece is ‘Control’. SolarBoss ensures that you get the absolute maximum out of your solar investment. (You can follow the web link above the graph and calculate your own. It’s a respected site from the European Commission.)
Our Early Users Love it.
John: “We have a pretty typical solar setup. 3000 watts of panels and a 3KW inverter. We always had to be careful to check what was already on before we turned anything else on. This gadget just makes it all automatic and works unseen until you forget it’s there. Setting up was easy, even for a technical duffer like me and the company have been really helpful in explain things. Can’t imagine how we used to cope without it.”
Paul: “I never thought that we could consider Air Conditioning on solar power. Now we can be cool in summer and warm in winter.

<b>Lightning Facts</b>
</h2>
<p></p>
<b>FACT:</b>  Lightning and severe storm detection is essential to protecting
lives.<br/><br/><p><b>FACT:</b> Existing lightning detection technology
was developed decades ago, is outdated and provides inaccurate data, including
false positive alerts. For those of you who are not weather aficionados, false
positives are interference from energy all around us, such as lawn mowers,
cars, etc.</p>
<p><b>FACT: </b> While organizations spend an estimated
$8B annually on detection hardware, data feeds, apps and subscription services,
we have no better knowledge of when and where locally a lightning might strike,
where a tornado might be forming or when to resume play.</p>
<p>We’ve all wondered why weather forecasts are inaccurate or
why severe weather warnings cover huge geographic areas but NOT our LOCAL towns. </p>
<p>As
we mentioned before, weather detection technology has not fundamentally changed
in <b>decades</b> even though distribution methods have. So, while
fancy and really cool graphics show up on your phone, this is just repackaged
low quality weather information being widely disseminated to the public at
large. <br/></p>
<p>That is about to change!</p>
<p></p>

few people know that the majority of information you turn to and count on to
make weather decisions is often inaccurate, delayed or unreliable data.""

<br/>The
technology driving <b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b><b>4
</b>was
developed by Edward Shaver, our CTO. He is the physicist who pioneered the
commercial hand-held storm detection industry dedicating decades of research
and development to earlier generations of hand-held lightning detection
devices (the Skyscan®
 and ThunderBolt®
 products). He began this work in the
1990’s after learning of a fatal lightning strike of a young child standing on
second base during a baseball game. Knowing that you and your child are no safer today with all of the
weather apps on your phone or forecasts on the radio or TV, which use
technology that is decades old, Edward wanted to offer a scientific solution
where others have tried but failed. He has dedicated his life’s work and has
developed completely revolutionary proprietary hardware and software with
algorithms, 3 microprocessors and patent-pending <b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b><b>4
</b>Quad-Matrix antenna array
with you in mind.<br/><p></p>

        The  <b>NIMBUS™4D</b> combines the un-paralleled  storm detection 
capabilities of the NIMBUS™4 with Entropy’s patent-pending directional 
system.  Using the high-resolution storm data collected by the 4-channel
 antenna array, the <b>NIMBUS™ 4D</b> software provides the bearing to storm 
activity in 20 degree segments.  Just as with all storm information provided by the  NIMBUS™
 technology,  the storm direction is based on real-time data processed 
at the exact location of the  NIMBUS™ unit.

ZERO FALSE
POSITIVES - Why this is important</b></p>
<p>The <b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b><b> Quad-Matrix</b> antenna array was designed to maximize
sensitivity and accuracy of storm data and to reduce the chance of false
positive signals to zero. This is the result of the direct-to-digital
signal conversion, and the ability of the <b>NIMBUS<sup>™</sup></b> to
simultaneously analyze four channels of data. The <b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b> is the ONLY personal storm detector that captures the
full incoming waveform, and this information allows the <b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b> to easily see the difference between lightning signals, and
signals from any other source of electronic noise (such as lawn mowers, cars,
etc.). Older products only use one or two channels for detection, but even
these channels simply capture a pulse of energy and NOT the full waveform. 
This is the reason these older products are prone to showing false positive
warnings, and also prone to missing actual lightning strokes completely.  </p>
<p><b><span>How it works...<br/></span></b></p>
<p><b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b> technology
utilizes the most advanced, computing power with our patent-pending proprietary
antenna array to monitor, analyze and share weather conditions happening around
you in REAL TIME. Continuous visual text and strobe alerts keep you informed of
local weather activity as it happens. Any storm detector is only as good as the
antenna system collecting the data, and the antenna design in the <b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b>
is so good that we are getting it patented. Four channels of direct-to-digital
data give the <b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b>
the power it needs to the job. Your unit is one smart storm detector and it's
super easy to use!  <br/></p>
<p>
<b><span>What is does...</span></b></p>
<p><b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b><b>4</b> will
provide you with ETA, the speed and direction (<b>NIMBUS<sup>™</sup></b><b>4D</b>)
as the storm is forming or moving toward you, time-to-clear, squall lines,
lightning strikes, cloud-to-cloud (truly unique to the <b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b>)
and cloud-to-ground lightning and even pre-tornado conditions. The <b>NIMBUS</b><b><sup>™</sup></b>
software architecture includes the ability to store up to a year’s worth of
data inside the unit.<span>  Two USB ports
allow for a wide range of Internet connectivity to support data networking,
remote diagnostics, and control of additional wireless accessories that can
make your <b>NIMBUS</b></span><b><sup>™</sup></b>

Personal
Lightning, Storm and Pre-Tornado Detection



Do something about DANGEROUS lightning and severe weather BEFORE it strikes!

The
weather affects and influences almost everything you do! With 40 to 50
lightning flashes per SECOND and 1.4 BILLION flashes per year across the globe*,
the weather detection hardware, regional data feeds and apps providing general information
you currently rely on aren’t good enough to make real-time, local decisions in
real-time situations! You can’t do anything about the weather unless you
have the best information available, and the NIMBUS™ technology was created to do just that!
The
NIMBUS™4 Personal Lightning, Storm and Pre-Tornado Detector is about to change the weather industry



Do you know lightning can strike from the trailing edge of a
storm up to 8 MILES away AFTER the storm has PASSED and you have blue
skies overhead? That’s often after the umpire, referee, or golf course ranger
gave the ALL-CLEAR to resume play!


NIMBUS™ knows.
Do you know when to call the game based on lightning at a baseball, lacrosse or soccer game or
tournament? Did the ump or ref base his/her decision by simply hearing or seeing
it? Is the customary 30-minute wait correct—sometimes yes, but MOST times NO!





NIMBUS™ knows.
Out Boating on a
beautiful day? Do you know when you
have just enough time to come about and return to shore when lightning and storms are
approaching? 






NIMBUS™ knows. 
Do you know how many more holes you can safely play before the
approaching storm and LIGHTNING threatens the course?



NIMBUS™ knows.
NIMBUSTM4 knows where the lightning and the storms are, how fast they are
approaching you, how much time you have before the storm is on top of you, when
it is safe to return and so much
more!  


Whether
you're playing sports, on a boat, biking, hiking or on a golf course, you want
accurate weather information.  If you're responsible for children playing
outdoors or you're part of a crew, the weather has a direct impact on
you. Severe weather can form without warning and quite often people are
caught off guard. That's about to change with NIMBUS™4! 
NIMBUS™4 will
provide you with Estimated Time of Arrival, the speed and direction (NIMBUS™4D)
as the storm is forming or moving toward you, time-to-clear, squall lines,
lightning strikes, cloud-to-cloud (truly unique to the NIMBUS™)
and cloud-to-ground lightning and even pre-tornado conditions.



NIMBUS™ knows and You will too.

Lightning Facts


FACT:  Lightning and severe storm detection is essential to protecting
lives.FACT: Existing lightning detection technology
was developed decades ago, is outdated and provides inaccurate data, including
false positive alerts. For those of you who are not weather aficionados, false
positives are interference from energy all around us, such as lawn mowers,
cars, etc.
FACT:  While organizations spend an estimated
$8B annually on detection hardware, data feeds, apps and subscription services,
we have no better knowledge of when and where locally a lightning might strike,
where a tornado might be forming or when to resume play.
We’ve all wondered why weather forecasts are inaccurate or
why severe weather warnings cover huge geographic areas but NOT our LOCAL towns. 
As
we mentioned before, weather detection technology has not fundamentally changed
in decades even though distribution methods have. So, while
fancy and really cool graphics show up on your phone, this is just repackaged
low quality weather information being widely disseminated to the public at
large. 
That is about to change!

""Unfortunately
few people know that the majority of information you turn to and count on to
make weather decisions is often inaccurate, delayed or unreliable data.""                                       
Edward
F. Shaver, CTO
Entropy 

The passion behind the product...





The
technology driving NIMBUS™4
was
developed by Edward Shaver, our CTO. He is the physicist who pioneered the
commercial hand-held storm detection industry dedicating decades of research
and development to earlier generations of hand-held lightning detection
devices (the Skyscan®
 and ThunderBolt®
 products). He began this work in the
1990’s after learning of a fatal lightning strike of a young child standing on
second base during a baseball game. Knowing that you and your child are no safer today with all of the
weather apps on your phone or forecasts on the radio or TV, which use
technology that is decades old, Edward wanted to offer a scientific solution
where others have tried but failed. He has dedicated his life’s work and has
developed completely revolutionary proprietary hardware and software with
algorithms, 3 microprocessors and patent-pending NIMBUS™4
Quad-Matrix antenna array
with you in mind.







 STORM DETECTION TAKES A NEW DIRECTION!








 Be one of the first to own this breakthrough technology!




REAL-TIME STORM INFORMATION NOW WITH DIRECTIONALITY!
  

 


        The  NIMBUS™4D combines the un-paralleled  storm detection 
capabilities of the NIMBUS™4 with Entropy’s patent-pending directional 
system.  Using the high-resolution storm data collected by the 4-channel
 antenna array, the NIMBUS™ 4D software provides the bearing to storm 
activity in 20 degree segments.  Just as with all storm information provided by the  NIMBUS™
 technology,  the storm direction is based on real-time data processed 
at the exact location of the  NIMBUS™ unit. 
        
         
        
      




 





The  NIMBUS™4D display uses an on-board compass module to 
display the bearing to storm activity relative to true North.  The storm
 bearing information is updated in real-time using the storm data being 
collected by the unit.

<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>During Zimbabwe’s period of land redistribution, 4,500 European owned farms (more than a quarter of the country) were handed over to 245,000 Black farmers. Some believe that Zimbabwe experienced a sharp decline in farm production due to the “fact” that “many of these ‘farmers’ had no experience or training in farming.” Others contend that failure was pre-destined because Black farmers lacked the resources necessary to be successful. </p>
<p>Before the land distribution, less than 5% of Zimbabwean landowners/leaseholders were women. Afterwards, that number has risen to 20%. To empower these women and encourage more to pursue land ownership and entrepreneurship, blockchain-based financial solution start-up, BitMari, launched the BitMari Agritech Accelerator in partnership with the Women Farmers Land and Agricultural Trust. This is a crowdfunding campaign to award monetary funds--in the form of blockchain based digital coupons-- to women farmers in Zimbabwe so that they can acquire the farming inputs/equipment necessary for success in enterprise farming.</p>

</div></div>","Backstory
During Zimbabwe’s period of land redistribution, 4,500 European owned farms (more than a quarter of the country) were handed over to 245,000 Black farmers. Some believe that Zimbabwe experienced a sharp decline in farm production due to the “fact” that “many of these ‘farmers’ had no experience or training in farming.” Others contend that failure was pre-destined because Black farmers lacked the resources necessary to be successful. 
Before the land distribution, less than 5% of Zimbabwean landowners/leaseholders were women. Afterwards, that number has risen to 20%. To empower these women and encourage more to pursue land ownership and entrepreneurship, blockchain-based financial solution start-up, BitMari, launched the BitMari Agritech Accelerator in partnership with the Women Farmers Land and Agricultural Trust. This is a crowdfunding campaign to award monetary funds--in the form of blockchain based digital coupons-- to women farmers in Zimbabwe so that they can acquire the farming inputs/equipment necessary for success in enterprise farming.

What We Need 

BitMari is looking to raise $20,000 to support three farms that were selected from our first Agritech Accelerator cohort. These entrepreneurs have the unique opportunity to participate in our Solar Modernization project which will help jumpstart their farming enterprises.

The amount and intensity of sunlight in any area is used to figure out what types of crops would grow best there and the best time of the year to plant them.
So it’s obvious that farms are planted in areas that receive a lot of sunlight, which is also a requisite for getting the most energy out of solar powered equipment.
The benefits to farmers include:


Solar energy saves farmers money. As the cost of energy continues to rise, farms that generate their own energy will become more and more important.

Solar power systems derive clean, pure energy from the sun. Installing solar panels on farms helps to combat greenhouse gas emissions and reduces our collective dependence on fossil fuel.
Irrigation becomes much easier. Where there’s solar power, remote water pumping becomes a possibility because it enables farmers to bring the energy to the equipment. No longer are they tied down by electrical wires. Now all they need is a few solar panels to power their pumps remotely.


The Impact

With our second cohort, BitMari is looking to not only promote ownership and entrepreneurship among women. The company is also looking to enhance each beneficiary’s prowess at her craft and help them to build something to leave to their children, an opportunity not afforded to Zimbabwean women of the past.

<br/>HOW CAN BEEKEEPING BE IMPROVED UPON?</h3>
<p>Humans have been making beehives for eons and Langstroth, Warre, Layens, Perrone, Slavic, Japanese, Ukrainian, Top Bar and other hive systems all have their strengths.  But with North American honey bee colony losses averaging over fifty percent in 2017, conventional practices with typical hive boxes need to be questioned.  We think beekeeping might benefit from some re-thinking, so we’re approaching it with a new look at improving how honey bees are housed.</p>
<ul>
<li>  First is improving the ratio of comb area to hive space for better thermal efficiency.   </li>
<li>  Second is reducing the amount of bee disturbance typical during hive inspections. </li>
<li>  Third is tighter hive construction with modular hive components you can grow with. </li>
<li>  Fourth, is exploring alternatives to the questionable practice of re-purposing wax.   </li>
<li>  Fifth, is applying technology to enable proactive hive monitoring and management​  </li>
</ul>
<p>Honeycomb Hives is pleased to introduce Lambrecht's amazing new Hexagonal Prism Hives featuring universally-sized Smart Frames and exclusive Comb Honey Cup Harvesting system, practical accessories and logical options swappable among all 5 Honeycomb Hive types.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540064830/lwxf4zlzflnfsybzoc1c.png"" src=""""/><br/>   </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>“Every journey begins with a single step” Lao Tzu </i></strong></p>
<p>What started as a single idea morphed into something else altogether and inspiration for a new beehive evolved into an integrative system.  The first step for us was our decision to focus on healthier honey bee environs. Making our innovative hive system more sustainable, affordable, approachable, profitable and available to beekeepers worldwide, is our journey. ​</p>
<p>Doug has come up with a remarkable system of well-fitted parts, manufactured from high-quality exterior plywood, to be assembled per order.  The secret is precision achievable  with CNC Routers. To ensure quality, hive boxes will ship assembled and beekeepers need only decide upon and apply paint or tung oil and  attach hardware and assemble their frames. </p>

<p>Honeycomb Hives are similar to other beehives worldwide in that they use removable comb frames for easy hive inspections and management.  There are five Honeycomb Hive types and all share exchangeable Hexagonal Smart-Frames.   Somewhat like Top Bar hives, these hives have a horizontal, rather than vertical, orientation.  This means beeks are lifting frames instead of heavy supers.   Honeycomb Hives frames can also be easily inspected with one hand. </p>

</div>
<p>Honeycomb Hive’s secret sauce and main differentiator, other than design, is the Smart-Frame System. This is what makes Lambrecht’s system remarkably integrative.

Serving honey bees and beekeepers is my ikigai. It gets me up early and inspires me. That, and encouragement from my clan, keeps me fully amped.</p>
<p>My work experience and combined skill sets are almost eerily aligned for this project.  In early adulthood I spent 15 years as a furniture designer/craftsman with distribution in 11 states.  I've also founded seven start-up companies, including several retail operations, two manufacturing firms, two Registered Investment Advisory firms (One sold to Suntrust) and an organic specialty foods distributor called Real Wasabi, with nationwide placements with Fresh Markets, Wegmans, Whole Foods, Kroger, Costco and others.

<p>ABOUT HONEYCOMB HIVES:</p>
</div><p>Honeycomb Hives, Inc. is a US-based startup that aims to change the shape of beehives in garden, backyard and urban apiaries, worldwide, offering a game-changing, affordable beekeeping system for more precisely keeping bees and harvesting natural comb honey.</p></div>","HOW CAN BEEKEEPING BE IMPROVED UPON?
Humans have been making beehives for eons and Langstroth, Warre, Layens, Perrone, Slavic, Japanese, Ukrainian, Top Bar and other hive systems all have their strengths.  But with North American honey bee colony losses averaging over fifty percent in 2017, conventional practices with typical hive boxes need to be questioned.  We think beekeeping might benefit from some re-thinking, so we’re approaching it with a new look at improving how honey bees are housed.

  First is improving the ratio of comb area to hive space for better thermal efficiency.   
  Second is reducing the amount of bee disturbance typical during hive inspections. 
  Third is tighter hive construction with modular hive components you can grow with. 
  Fourth, is exploring alternatives to the questionable practice of re-purposing wax.   
  Fifth, is applying technology to enable proactive hive monitoring and management​  

Honeycomb Hives is pleased to introduce Lambrecht's amazing new Hexagonal Prism Hives featuring universally-sized Smart Frames and exclusive Comb Honey Cup Harvesting system, practical accessories and logical options swappable among all 5 Honeycomb Hive types.
   
“Every journey begins with a single step” Lao Tzu 
What started as a single idea morphed into something else altogether and inspiration for a new beehive evolved into an integrative system.  The first step for us was our decision to focus on healthier honey bee environs. Making our innovative hive system more sustainable, affordable, approachable, profitable and available to beekeepers worldwide, is our journey. ​
Doug has come up with a remarkable system of well-fitted parts, manufactured from high-quality exterior plywood, to be assembled per order.  The secret is precision achievable  with CNC Routers. To ensure quality, hive boxes will ship assembled and beekeepers need only decide upon and apply paint or tung oil and  attach hardware and assemble their frames.

   How do Honeycomb Hives Work?
Honeycomb Hives are similar to other beehives worldwide in that they use removable comb frames for easy hive inspections and management.  There are five Honeycomb Hive types and all share exchangeable Hexagonal Smart-Frames.   Somewhat like Top Bar hives, these hives have a horizontal, rather than vertical, orientation.  This means beeks are lifting frames instead of heavy supers.   Honeycomb Hives frames can also be easily inspected with one hand. 



   Our Hexagonal Smart-Frames System

Honeycomb Hive’s secret sauce and main differentiator, other than design, is the Smart-Frame System. This is what makes Lambrecht’s system remarkably integrative. Crafted to allow 3/8” bee space below, around and above, these hexagonal frames allow bees freedom of choice for movement amongst frames, improve air circulation and also help reduce propolis. 
The Honeycomb Smart-Frames System includes frame types that accept either wax or plastic foundation, comb honey cups, queen-excluders, frames for natural comb and follower boards. Together with divider boards, these hive tools comprise our Smart-Frame System and are exchangeable among Honeycomb Hive types.
Our Smart-Frames for foundation are also easier and quicker to work with at the bench. When installing foundation, the two frame halves fit together to ""sandwich"" the foundation between them, so it is fully supported all the way around and no tedious wiring work is necessary
All Smart-Frames also feature knurled-knob adjustable spacers to allow beeks to tweak their frame spacing with a twist of the wrist.  Whether for small cell work, brood boxes, overwintering or honey production, frame spacing adjustments are easy-peasy and no tools are needed.  (variable from 1  1/8”  to  1  1/2”) 

  Integrative Features and Accessories
Logical options allow beekeepers ultimate flexibility in choosing which hive and frame types best suit their preferences.  For example, any type of foundations are readily accepted or natural beekeepers can opt for our natural comb frames. Feeding options include in-hive divider feeders or 2 quart Cupola feeders or patty boards. Other logical options include observation panes, screen bottoms, pull-out debris trays and pollen traps.

 

  Beekeeping is fun, but Serious Business
The stakes are high!   Honey Bee colonies keep their cluster temperature at 94 F year round to protect their queen and brood. Warm moist air from the bees cluster rises in typical rectangular beehives to meet the cold flat top.  There condensation occurs and rains down onto the clustering bees.  They can usually handle cold but not wet.  HONEYCOMB HIVES Peaked Roof keeps the bees dry.
Hexagonal hives are more thermally-efficient so your bees conserve energy by spending less.
 

  Preferred Beehive Management Practices
1)  Use Follower Boards to right-size hive space as the colony grows. Honey Bees love tight spaces and tighter hives are easier for them to defend.  With a front entrance like Nucs or Starter Hive, a great practice is to use a Follower Board right against the front entrance before inserting comb frames.  This creates a vestibule of sorts where bees can gather and also can defend their entrance.
2)  Don't give your bees too many frames or too much space. Rather, a good practice is to let them grow into their hive space gradually. When installing a new package or nuc, give them only four or five frames to start, backed by a Follower Board. Your queen will be happier with this arrangement and as she fills the combs with brood you can easily monitor progress and move the follower board to add a couple more frames as the girls build them out.  When you see the first full honey frame, you can pull the Follower Board as the queen will rarely venture past that first frame of honey in Honeycomb Horizontal Hives 

 Risks and challenges
Of course all new ventures face challenges, but serial entrepreneurs learn that mitigating risks is all about solid strategies and preparation. Numerous previous startups have helped us learn that success is dependent upon careful advance planning and follow-through. Our production strategy centers on solid product engineering and precise design details and is strengthened by harmonious relations with the factory team that will produce our hive parts.

<h3>WONGDI PRAYER WHEELS</h3>
<p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>    Aka here. I'm the CEO of Kada Imports Ltd. My background has been in business/ entrepreneurship, education, operations and project management. I have a passion for projects that are cultural, well intentioned/ purposeful, and aim to better society (in some fashion). </p>
<p>This project is hugely exciting for me because it brings a lot of my personal passions together. The Himalayas, where my father is from, where my brother was born, where my mom, dad, and brother (and others) opened a school (Taktse International School) is a region in rapid transition. This transition can be very overwhelming for locals, elderly, the younger generations, etc. There are very few ways that respect the old traditions while integrating new sciences, ideas, and technologies. This is one of them.</p>
<p>If we can make prayer wheels spin better then there will be more good merit/ Sonam (merit) in the world. I think we can all agree that more good energy is needed in this world. It will make spinning prayer wheels enter the modern world (of efficiency) with its culture intact. And the most exciting part for me is that it will create green energy in a part of the world that is known for its connection to nature, spirits and animals and is also connecting two of the largest power using countries (India &amp; China) in the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>BRING IT TO LIFE:</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>We will need approximately $5k to bring this project from concept to prototype. This funding will go to our engineering team/ partners, to research and implementation, and preparation of the prototype for the market.</p>
<p>Any and all donations are accepted and appreciated. With a certain level of donation you will receive a special gift. All of these gift you can learn more about on our website, <a href=""http://www.kadaimports.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kadaimports.com</a>. </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>With a donation of $50 you will receive a miniature prayer wheel. (similar to the one in our promo video). It is great for your desk, coffee table, house entrance/exit, etc. </li>
<li>With a donation of $100 you will receive a mini prayer wheel and 1 ounce of Himalayan, black tea. </li>
<li>With a donation of $200 you will receive the two prior items as well as a Himalayan tote bag, stitched together with recycled nylon and a great way to limit your plastic usage. It is strong and great for trips to the grocery store, beach, and more. </li>
<li>With a donation of $300 you get the mini prayer wheel, the tea, the tote bag, and a blessed Kada. Now a kada is, traditionally/ usually, a blessed, white, silk scarf that is draped over your shoulders, a painting, a photo, or something that has meaning to you in your life. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
<p>Your donation and support will make us one step closer to making a prayer wheel that spins more efficiently. In an era of perpetually increasing power demands having a mechanism that increases the proliferation of good karma in the simplest of ways, spinning a wheel, seems increasingly important. The prayer wheel has always had a symbolic presence in the Buddhist culture and now it can be updated in a way that preserves that culture but also adds an additional level of functionality. In addition to the increased good karma, these prayer wheels could help supplement the need for energy in these communities. If the prayer wheels are able to create and capture the energy to power things like lights, heaters, internet, and more it makes a unique cross generational and cross cultural connection that benefits all sentient beings.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>This project does not come without risks and challenges. We will have to find a way to make these prototypes scalable with a price point that makes sense for monasteries and communities to adopt them. We will need to make them connect to the power grid or distribute the power. We will need to navigate different cultures, worlds, religions, people, etc. </p>
<p>Our plan is to first create the prototype. Second is to get feedback from the community we hope to serve. Third is to adjust and modify our invention to be able to meet requirements. Fourth is to strategize/ create an integration and implementation plan.</p>

A giant automatically driven wing, designed and implemented by our team, flies between 600 and 2000 meters to harvest the mechanical energy of the high altitude winds. Two high-strength ropes connect the wing to the base and transmit its tension, which activates the power generators located on the ground, thus producing energy. Along the years, our engineers have developed several prototypes.<br/></span></div>

source of energy.


Imagine a
technology that can exploit it.



Imagine
what a paramount advantage it would be for all of us.


What if all
this was not a figment of your imagination?






Here we are.

We have found the Source, the High Altitude Winds.

We have got the Technology, the KiteGen Stem.

We are just a step away from making all this possible.



Now it's your turn!! 







Help us make the final step, the installation of our big scale generator, and take part in the
new energy era.
Each Non-Profit which is now supporting us will benefit from the revenues that will come from the sale of
the energy produced by our 1st KiteGen Stem.





Installation site: Giaveno - TO - Italy


Sound good enough?! Learn more…





We do not go in search of windy areas to install
our machines.


We
just go wherever energy is needed!








   


The KiteGen Stem, now covered by 40 international patents, is based on a quite simple working principle. A giant automatically driven wing, designed and implemented by our team, flies between 600 and 2000 meters to harvest the mechanical energy of the high altitude winds. Two high-strength ropes connect the wing to the base and transmit its tension, which activates the power generators located on the ground, thus producing energy. Along the years, our engineers have developed several prototypes.

2006 - Mobile Gen  
2012 - KiteGen Stem  
2014 - KiteWing - 3MW



...our goal is important and you can offer us invaluable
help....


...our success could be a paramount achievement for all
mankind...

...this is why we will return the favor!




The more we will be able to implement our technology, the more our partners will get.



Now, imagine what we could do, all together, in
favor of the environment and of the people all over the world


HELP MAKE IT HAPPEN!

<p>My name is Ralph Black and I have been an idea guy for as long as I can remember.  Years ago my first idea for a marketable product was ""The Comic Leg"".  This was a leg that hung out of the trunk of your car and had different sayings like ""Boss in Trunk"", ""Tourist in Trunk"" etc.  I have worked in the automotive parts manufacturing and distribution industry as an executive for almost a decade as well as owned my own businesses and ran others over the last 35 Years.  I am an Author of the book ""So you Think Your Ready for Life"" (to be released in the fall of 2017) a book of stories with lessons to help you get through all types of hiccups in your path through life.  As a father and now a grandfather I own the responsibility of making this world better for my children and my grandchildren.</p>
<p>After the initial designs and prototype used for proof of concept we joined forces with The University of Illinois at Chicago and their mechanical engineer design team.  We needed to model the TPRES and determine feasibility on a large scale.  After the successful completion of the studies we are now ready to build the production scale TPRES TM for in-road testing and that's where we need your help or shall I say contribution to the pursuit of saving our environment for each other and our children.</p>
<p>Your contribution to the TPRES TM brings us closer to producing mass amounts of energy from every day traffic.  Once completed we can fulfill letters of intent we have received from cities and start installing the completed products not only in areas of America but also in other countries where traffic is high but energy resources are minimal.</p>
<p>Imagine having to live each day with only a few hours a day to use electricity to cook, do laundry, access the web, heat or cool your home.  Then from everyday traffic and an installed TPRES TM all of a sudden, you can now utilize electricity throughout the day.  Bringing electricity to the masses and reducing our overall carbon footprint is our goal and we hope its yours too.</p>

<p>We currently need $244,790.00 to fund the remaining R&amp;D and to build the in-road production unit for live real time usage and final testing.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Since we own the Patent on the TPRES TM the Technology risk is minimal but we are always trying to find ways to increase the power production.  So we need to test different size cylinders and air generation devices to maximize the TPRES TM technology.</p>

<p>My name is ALLEN SCHWARTZ MD, a licensed medical doctor for over 40 years, in private practice in FLORIDA. I've designed and fabricated a working prototype with the help of engineers from mainland China and the UK. I graduated with a BS with Honors with Thesis from Stevens Institute of Technology, in Hoboken, NJ.</p>
<p>Since 2012,  I've work tirelessly to invent a non-polluting power source FREE FROM THE GRID, affordable, lightweight and portable. The device uses a patented motionless rotor that supplies up to 15,000 Watts of power depending on the model(3,000, 6000, 12,000 and 15,000 watts).  It is based on Faradays Law of electromagnetic induction. It uses and imbedded electronic controller meter that monitors, in Realtime, Power IN, Power OUT, Voltage IN, Voltage OUT, Current IN, and Current OUT using a Wi-Fi feature.  The invention is in the prototype stage and is in dire need of generous donors as yourselves to make this invention moved to market ASAP. This product does not compete with the fossil-fuel industry but rather compliment it as an alternative energy source that can be used anywhere in the world. Moreover, the cost of energy to power your home has become burdensome and in many instances, unaffordable especially among the elderly on fixed income.    </p>
<p>With the help of contributors like yourselves, we can get this prototype to market within 12 months. I am passionate about this product and its potential to change peoples lives, not only in the USA but throughout the world.</p>
<p>On a personal note, several years ago, I was involved in medical volunteer work at a rural hospital in KENYA. The price of power was such, that I personally witnessed that even the local hospital's power was cut off for lack of payment of their energy bills on multiple occasions.  Moreover, even medical doctors' power to their homes was cut off due to difficulty paying their electric bills. So affordable energy is a problem worldwide!</p>

All you need to do is unscrew the valve.Do you offer different finishes?The Valv’econ’eau Kit is only available in one finish.The system Valv'econ’eau KitA revolutionary technology of water saving. 3 x less water without pressure drop. A nice gesture for the planet!
No need a professional to install this concept.
Always keep the same pressure.
Always keep the same temperature adjusted at the start.
The Valv'econ’eau Kit is Quebec products. It saves on electricity costs to heat the water, consumption charges, if any. You fill less quickly your septic tank. Hot water accounts for 20% of your electricity bill according to the Canadian Center for Data and Analysis of Final Energy Consumption in the Building SectorMain uses of hot water by households *
34% - Use of faucets (with aerator down by about 40%)
25% - Showers (75% drop with Valv'econeau Kit)
17% - Baths
15% - Washing clothes
4% - Dishwashing
 5% - Leaks
Here is more information about Valv'econ'eau Kit:According to the analysis page on the Hydro-Québec 2017 website:Comparable consumption: water and energy (body care (shower) --family of 3 people).1- Standard shower, consumption of 11 liters / minute so 120 liters / shower of 8 minutes. Annual water costs: $ 416 and use of 65,700 cubic meters per year.2- Reduced jet knob, consumption of 7.625 liters / minute, therefore 61 liters / shower of 8 minutes. Annual water costs: $ 208 and use of 33,397.5 cubic meters per year.3- Valv’econ’eau Kit with our valve, consumption of 3.7 liters / minute therefore 30 liters / shower of 8 minutes. Annual water costs: $ 98.55 and use of 16.425 cubic meters per year.To validate Valv'econ’eau Kit, we transformed a bathroom into a test room (laboratory). The tests were done for 156 hours to make no mistake, always repeating the same technique.This has shown regularity in drinking water consumption.1- The valve was installed after a shower.2- We blocked the bath drain3- Several people (participants) took a shower; the length of time used for body care varies from 6 to 12 minutes. 8 minutes is the average time.4- After determining the time allotted for the tests, we have marked the level of water accumulated after each shower.5- We have calibrated in liter a container.6- We emptied the bath. Obstructed a second time the bath. Fold liter by liter with the calibrated container up to the registered marks.7- The results showed between 18 liters to 22 liters each time.Considering the time diversity that users could use, we prefer to grant an average of 30 liters / shower of 8 minutes and this even if our tests give a lesser result.On June 21, 2016, we received the Intertek test report in Lachine # 102558569MTL-005, project # G102558569 Requirement of the standard: ASME A112.18.1-2012 / CSA B125.1-12 Plumbing supply fittings.The prototype has passed the following tests:
5.3.2 Burst pressure
5.6 Endurance test
The Fournier Patent Agency in ville Laprairie has been mandated by Michel Pelletier the designer of the valve for International Patent # PCT / CA2012 / 000722, US # 14 / 236,617 and Canada pending CIPOWe need $ 125,000 to cover the following fees:Mold, trade mark (CA & US), valve & ptototype design (phase1), homologation (phase 1 and phase 2), internet store, advertising, video (phase 1 and phase 2), translation, manufacturing Valv 'Econ’eau Kit, employee for sending, shower kit (Valv’econeau, WaterSense® shower head,  2 hoses, support), packaging, publicity.Make a difference!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Why is the <strong>Gravity Drive Pod</strong> different?</p>
<p>This technology does not violate the laws of conservation of energy or thermodynamics. The <strong>Gravity Drive Pod</strong> is backed by our provisional patent and computational physics modeling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Gravity Drive Pod</strong> is composed of two independent systems that leverage the torque generated from a falling mass. The first system is comprised of a series of falling masses working against the counter-torque of a generator that acts as a load to generate constant power.

<h3>This Technology Will Revolutionize the Way High-Performance Buildings Are Insulated!</h3>
<p>The good ol' Swiss have it all! Chocolate, cheese, Swiss army knives, watches, gorgeous mountains and lakes, an excellent public transportation system and <u><strong>SAF</strong></u> - the <strong>S</strong>olar <strong>A</strong>ctivated <strong>F</strong>acade, an amazing, green, exterior wall paneling system that uses the power of the sun to keep buildings warm in the winter. BUT IT DOES NOT EXIST IN AMERICA!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Combat climate change with less resources by using the sun</strong></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535302950/pouqejbxmcetb4sroqxh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>(Note to investors: Please inquire directly for our business plan.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Skinny</h3>
<p>Conventional high-performance walls typically include thick layers of insulation. However, the majority of them are not free of concerns <strong>1)</strong> making walls overly thick, applying high-performance materials that <strong>2)</strong> significantly burden the environment, <strong>3)</strong> increase the carbon footprint and <strong>4)</strong> impose health risks on humans, and <strong>5)</strong> depending on the choice of building skin can significantly increase maintenance, repair and replacement costs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535103072/y81owohq6nzckx6t3xzs.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>SAF is a unique, eco-friendly, one of a kind, exterior wall paneling system made of wood and glass that harnesses the sun's energy in passive solar heat gain, as windows do, thereby giving the building a thermal blanket that can last many hours into the night.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>LEAN &amp; GREEN through passive solar heat gain</i></strong></p>
<p>Through this process a wall requires much less insulation to become high-performing, making walls much thinner to the point where it can save a lot of valuable resources, significantly reduce or even eliminate harmful insulation materials to human health or the environment. Furthermore, the glass cover provides a durable, low maintenance building skin that at the same time protects and maintains the natural beauty of the wood behind it, giving SAF an amazing eco-modern architectural appeal.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534409901/o9qxtyze0bj3jqzqbxgw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>SAF can <strong>save up to 90% in heating and cooling</strong> energy and <strong>up to 85% in the wall's carbon footprint.</strong></p>
<p>It gets even better! SAF can be equipped with photovoltaic (solar) cells to generate valuable renewable energy thereby making SAF a passive <u>AND</u> active solar system.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534410111/nyhcjxmf1kgy2wdp0dvl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It is our mission to help America toward a carbon-free and energy self-sufficient building environment. <strong>Getting our foot in the door is our biggest challenge for which we need your help</strong>, because, and unfortunately, it takes a lot of resources and time to go out there, find and convince the first American adopters to trust in the sun that it will do the job and save on the energy bill as well as the environment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Nearly half of America's CO2 emissions are caused by buildings</i></strong></p>
<p>This campaign will enable us to build a demonstration site in at least one location (Boston or Vancouver area), in order to showcase SAF to North America reaching an important milestone in our business development that typically is poorly funded by professional investors. Once built it will greatly improve our future capital raising abilities as well as generate sales.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Does it Really Work?</h3>
<p>Yes it does! SAF has been tested and already been implemented in and around Switzerland many times, of which many have been <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minergie"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Minergie®</a> certified and several have received sustainability and design awards. It is a high-quality system that has passed all of the tests and standards in Switzerland.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Give ""Passive-Solar"" a Chance to Break into the Market</h3>
<p>We need $250,000 to be able to reach important milestones that are essential for the survival of this business venture within the next 6 to 9 months. These milestones are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Build a prototype with local manufacturers to set up logistics, establish quality standards and determine accurate system cost.</li>
<li>Build a demonstration site to showcase the technology in order to attract clients, architects and investors. Several demonstration site opportunities already exist.</li>
<li>Build a professional team for marketing, sales and support as well as business development and project management.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534415095/gxxzs4hblktzislojtm2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What If We Don't Reach Our Target?</h3>
<p>Our ability to operate at full capacity and our financial runway will be significantly diminished eventually jeopardizing our venture to bring SAF to America. More time would have to be spent on raising more capital thereby slowing progress even more. Nevertheless, I, Eric Nelson (founder) will continue to fight, bootstrap, work night time jobs and eat Ramen noodles until we get a demonstration site up.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>I believe in the big potential of SAF</strong></i></p>
<p>If we should go over our target, don't stop donating! A demonstration site will not make the company automatically profitable, but it will certainly get us a lot closer. Future investment round(s) are therefore likely and may involve equity. Let us know if you are interested.</p>
<p><strong>Update Oct. 2nd, 2018: </strong><br/>Our campaign is soon coming to an end, quite a bit short of our target. The money raised will go toward expenses incurred toward pursuing different fundraising opportunities and other administrative cost to keep the company going. A big thank you toward our supporters so far.</p>

This Technology Will Revolutionize the Way High-Performance Buildings Are Insulated!
The good ol' Swiss have it all! Chocolate, cheese, Swiss army knives, watches, gorgeous mountains and lakes, an excellent public transportation system and SAF - the Solar Activated Facade, an amazing, green, exterior wall paneling system that uses the power of the sun to keep buildings warm in the winter.

Combat climate change with less resources by using the sun

(Note to investors: Please inquire directly for our business plan.)
 
The Skinny
Conventional high-performance walls typically include thick layers of insulation. However, the majority of them are not free of concerns 1) making walls overly thick, applying high-performance materials that 2) significantly burden the environment, 3) increase the carbon footprint and 4) impose health risks on humans, and 5) depending on the choice of building skin can significantly increase maintenance, repair and replacement costs.

SAF is a unique, eco-friendly, one of a kind, exterior wall paneling system made of wood and glass that harnesses the sun's energy in passive solar heat gain, as windows do, thereby giving the building a thermal blanket that can last many hours into the night.
LEAN & GREEN through passive solar heat gain
Through this process a wall requires much less insulation to become high-performing, making walls much thinner to the point where it can save a lot of valuable resources, significantly reduce or even eliminate harmful insulation materials to human health or the environment. Furthermore, the glass cover provides a durable, low maintenance building skin that at the same time protects and maintains the natural beauty of the wood behind it, giving SAF an amazing eco-modern architectural appeal.

SAF can save up to 90% in heating and cooling energy and up to 85% in the wall's carbon footprint.
It gets even better! SAF can be equipped with photovoltaic (solar) cells to generate valuable renewable energy thereby making SAF a passive AND active solar system.

It is our mission to help America toward a carbon-free and energy self-sufficient building environment. Getting our foot in the door is our biggest challenge for which we need your help, because, and unfortunately, it takes a lot of resources and time to go out there, find and convince the first American adopters to trust in the sun that it will do the job and save on the energy bill as well as the environment.
Nearly half of America's CO2 emissions are caused by buildings
This campaign will enable us to build a demonstration site in at least one location (Boston or Vancouver area), in order to showcase SAF to North America reaching an important milestone in our business development that typically is poorly funded by professional investors. Once built it will greatly improve our future capital raising abilities as well as generate sales.
 

Does it Really Work?
Yes it does! SAF has been tested and already been implemented in and around Switzerland many times, of which many have been Minergie® certified and several have received sustainability and design awards. It is a high-quality system that has passed all of the tests and standards in Switzerland.

We need $250,000 to be able to reach important milestones that are essential for the survival of this business venture within the next 6 to 9 months. These milestones are:

Build a prototype with local manufacturers to set up logistics, establish quality standards and determine accurate system cost.
Build a demonstration site to showcase the technology in order to attract clients, architects and investors. Several demonstration site opportunities already exist.
Build a professional team for marketing, sales and support as well as business development and project management.

 

 
What If We Don't Reach Our Target?
Our ability to operate at full capacity and our financial runway will be significantly diminished eventually jeopardizing our venture to bring SAF to America. More time would have to be spent on raising more capital thereby slowing progress even more. Nevertheless, I, Eric Nelson (founder) will continue to fight, bootstrap, work night time jobs and eat Ramen noodles until we get a demonstration site up.
I believe in the big potential of SAF
If we should go over our target, don't stop donating! A demonstration site will not make the company automatically profitable, but it will certainly get us a lot closer. Future investment round(s) are therefore likely and may involve equity. Let us know if you are interested.
Update Oct. 2nd, 2018: Our campaign is soon coming to an end, quite a bit short of our target. The money raised will go toward expenses incurred toward pursuing different fundraising opportunities and other administrative cost to keep the company going. A big thank you toward our supporters so far.

Our Perks 

It is difficult for us to give you a piece of a SAF wall panel for your support. So, we figured we wanted to offer you something else, but not the standard key chain, mug, t-shirt or hat. Instead we want to offer you something special that is representative of our system, our business culture or our vision, but also something that is personal to show you who we are and how dedicated we are to this venture.
Our thank you gifts are useful and personal
Since some of our perks are very personal, meaning you will temporarily become part of our personal lives, we ask for patience and understanding in scheduling and making good on our promises. If for some reason we are unable to fulfill a perk, we promise to do our best to find an alternative solution.
We have perks for small personal donations as well as larger personal or corporate donations. Check them out!
We have just sweetened the deal!
Perk Update Sept. 12th, 2018: Have a chance to win a perk when we have reached the following campaign targets:
5,000 $     - Choice of any single ""Swiss Army Knife"" perk10,000 $   - The ""Swiss Army Knife Assortment"" perk50,000 $   - The ""Weekend Escape to Florida"" perk100,000 $ - The ""Escape to Florida"" perk150,000 $ - Return transatlantic flight for ONE person between major airports of mainland US/Canada and Switzerland/Europe.200,000 $ - In addition to the prior transantlantic flight prize. An AirBNB style ""Room in Central Switzerland"" for up to a week and ""A Cheese Fondue Made by a Swiss"". (For flights to Switzerland only.)250,000 $ - Return transatlantic flight for TWO persons between major airports of mainland US/Canada and Switzerland/Europe. Including an AirBNB style ""Room in Central Switzerland"" for up to a week and ""A Cheese Fondue Made by a Swiss"". (For flights to Switzerland only.)
The prizes of every milestone reached will be raffled off at the end of the campaign (approx. November 2018).
Note: Each dollar donated counts as a single lot, e.g. you get the Spartan, you have a 100 lots, thus 100 times bigger chance to win the big one. Only one single lot, not the dollar amount, is given to the following purchases: All ""Sponsors"", ""Partners"" and ""First Adopters"".
Your Impact
The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has detailed how close we are to a turning point in the earth's climate system, thus emphasizing the necessity for immediate and sustained action on climate change to preserve livable conditions on earth.
We want to act for you and with you now. With your donation, no matter how small or how big, we will go out and fight carbon emissions in buildings with our amazing, eco-friendly, passive-solar system SAF.
SAF saves energy, resources, carbon emissions - the planet
We strive for the  2,000 Watt Society, a vision for an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable future.
 

We Have Created a Buzz
We have worked hard in building a network of interested clients, architects, builders and have also drawn the attention of universities and the media, but we have to prove first that we can deliver and that is why we need to build this demonstration site with your help.
Many second-adopters, but who will be the first?
We are currently engaged in several project opportunities with different timescales. This campaign will determine how actionable these opportunities will become for us.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
First, donate! No matter how little or how much, donate now, donate fast and help give this campaign a large fan base and momentum. 
If you really can't donate a small amount, help us by sharing our campaign with others and urge them with a little personal introduction to our campaign to donate. Share this campaign in your social media and tell your friends who care. Share with emphasis!
Many reasons you can emphasize. Here are my favorites ;)
- Don't let the Swiss get away with this. America absolutely needs this!- Passive solar? Cool! You definitely have to give it a chance!- Aren't you about to build a house? Build with SAF!- If SAF is anywhere nearly as good as their chocolate than I will have two.
Win a prize for the most donations raised through your referrals
The top ten people that manage to raise the most donations (outside of their own) through their referrals will receive a free Swiss Army Knife of choice. In order for us to rate your efforts you need to send us some kind of plausible proof (screen shot?) that those funds were raised through your referral. We will announce the winners on our website at the end of the campaign.
 

It is Personal
I am Eric Nelson, founder and CEO of SAF Systems, a Swiss-American dual citizen, sustainable architect, building energy consultant, marine scientist, father of 3.5-year old twin boys, and former employee of Giuseppe Fent, the architect who invented SAF in Switzerland, where it is known as ""Lucido"".
I love nature, I love people, I love my work, I love my family, and I love my twin boys more than anything else in this world. They give me a purpose for all the sacrifices I make. I am driven by a vision to make this world a better place, a vision I want to share with as many people as possible. Please share my vision and bring us one step closer to reaching our goal.

 
My family and I and the whole team thank you from the bottom of our hearts!
THANK YOU!

<h3>Who Are We, And What Is The Solar Co-Op?</h3>
<p>First, a little about us.  We are an independent, renewable energy company, exclusively producing solar energy.  We develop, own, and operate utility scale solar facilities (solar farms - you know, those big facilities with thousands of solar panels).  <i>In other words, we are solar farmers.</i>  Now when we select a location for one of our projects, we don’t choose a place that only gets a few hours of sunlight each day, or where there’s lots of shade, or where it’s cloudy or raining all the time.</p>
<p>Because that would be dumb.</p>
<p>We choose a location that gets lots and lots of sunlight, all year round, because more sunlight means more electricity.  And that’s what makes a solar farm practical and profitable.  And this is great for people who are able to build solar farms, but it's not so great for everyone else.  And let’s be honest, not very many people are able to build a solar farm.</p>
<p>But what if they could?  What if the average person could build their own solar farm and could benefit directly from the electricity that it generates?</p>
<p>This is what the Solar Co-Op is all about - making it possible for normal people all over the world to become solar farmers.  We think it’s a pretty incredible idea, and we think the world will agree with us.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's The Plan?</h3>
<p>Okay, so here’s the deal: we're building the PORCUPINE CARIBOU SOLAR ARRAY (a 2.5MW utility scale solar facility).  <strong>We're building it regardless of whether or not anyone contributes to this campaign.</strong></p>
<p>Now, our plan was that<strong> if even one person</strong> - one single, solitary person, living anywhere in the world, <strong>was willing to put up just one dollar</strong> because they believed the Solar Co-Op is a good idea, <strong>then the PORCUPINE CARIBOU SOLAR ARRAY would be a Solar Co-Op</strong>, owned in part by ordinary, everyday people from all over the world.</p>
<p>That <strong>was</strong> the plan.  But before we could even launch this campaign, people from all over the world had already joined the Solar Co-Op!</p>

<p>The solar co-op will allow hundreds, even thousands of individuals to become solar farmers.  Their individual solar farms (some tiny, some large) will be tied together to create the co-op.  It's the same principle as a traditional agricultural co-op where you have a lot of small, family farms that cooperate (thus the term ""co-op"") so that they can compete in a huge market.  By working together, the little guys can compete with the big guys.</p>
<p>We've taken this agricultural co-op model, successful since the 17th century, and applied it to the modern energy industry.  The solar farming co-op makes solar power accessible to everyone, everywhere so that today, quite literally, <strong>anyone can be a solar farmer</strong>.  And since we want to solar co-op to be accessible to everyone, we've scaled down the size of the solar farm.  No longer is it necessary to have thousands of solar panels to be a solar farmer.  In fact, with the solar co-op, you don't even need <i>one</i> panel.  <strong>Made up of just 3 solar cells, our Nano Farm is the world's smallest solar farm!</strong>  For about the price of a large pizza, you can be the proud owner of a solar farm, and that farm will reduce coal consumption and eliminate CO2 emissions every single year. </p>
<p>The world, and especially young people all over the world are screaming at the top of their lungs for someone, somewhere to do something about the climate crisis.  We at PeakSunNRG sincerely hope that world leaders will listen and act, but...</p>

<p>Check this out: In the past, unless you had thousands of dollars, you couldn't really do much in the way of solar.  But now, if you've got even one extra dollar lying around, you have the power to meaningfully impact climate change.  Really, a dollar - check your couch cushions and that junk drawer in your kitchen for some spare change.  That one-time, one-dollar investment will have an impact on our environment for decades to come!</p>
<p>In the meantime, make your voice heard.  Share this project with your friends and family, and anyone else who will listen.  Use your social media network to let people know that the solar co-op is a thing; that they can actually <strong>do something about climate change</strong>.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We wanted to talk for a moment about the risks and challenges that we face in making the world's first, true solar co-op a reality.  Here's the thing, though: there aren't really any.</p>
<p>As we mentioned already, the PORCUPINE CARIBOU SOLAR ARRAY is going to be built regardless of whether or not we get any funding here.  The only question is, ""Will this solar facility be a solar co-op?""  That's why we were only asking for a dollar.  We're building this solar farm and we wanted to see if anyone wanted to be a part of it.</p>
<p>It's kinda like if we were in the kitchen and said, ""Hey, we're making coffee.  If anybody wants some, it's in the pot.""  If you want some coffee, great!  It's in the pot.  If you don't want coffee, that's okay too.  It's still in the pot.</p>
<p>And now, since we had people from all over the world step up and join the Solar Co-Op before we could even launch this campaign, we're already doing it!  So, if you think the solar co-op is a pretty fantastic idea, tell people about it!  If you want to be a solar farmer, reduce fossil fuel consumption, lower carbon emissions, and save some money on your electric bill, this is your chance.</p>

We wanted to talk for a moment about the risks and challenges that we face in making the world's first, true solar co-op a reality.  Here's the thing, though: there aren't really any.
As we mentioned already, the PORCUPINE CARIBOU SOLAR ARRAY is going to be built regardless of whether or not we get any funding here.  The only question is, ""Will this solar facility be a solar co-op?""  That's why we were only asking for a dollar.  We're building this solar farm and we wanted to see if anyone wanted to be a part of it.
It's kinda like if we were in the kitchen and said, ""Hey, we're making coffee.  If anybody wants some, it's in the pot.""  If you want some coffee, great!  It's in the pot.  If you don't want coffee, that's okay too.  It's still in the pot.
And now, since we had people from all over the world step up and join the Solar Co-Op before we could even launch this campaign, we're already doing it!  So, if you think the solar co-op is a pretty fantastic idea, tell people about it!  If you want to be a solar farmer, reduce fossil fuel consumption, lower carbon emissions, and save some money on your electric bill, this is your chance.",18.0,1,"2 Campaigns

however the current values represent an attempted ""reasonable max"".   Taking this answer, quartering it for good measure, suggests this solution offers a total potential climate impact in the range of 10-40ppm CO2e.  Of course this is caveats all the way down, and now let's start interrogating the model, but as an orientation to what is possible, this is what a well exercised consideration has produced.</p><p>This 10-40ppm CO2e impact compares to the 100-200ppm CO2e total impact required as summarized above.  While this is well short of the total solution needed for our climate problems, any one scenario that has the potential to contribute even 10+% of the total needed, is a consequential addition to the combined package of climate solutions.  The Local Carbon Network has the potential to be consequential slice of the solution pie. </p><p>The green-waste required to run such a project is 1.2 billion tonnes per year.  This represents less than 1% of the total yearly terrestrial photosynthetic production on the planet.  Our green-waste resources far exceed this globally.  The US alone has identified 1 billion tonnes of biomass byproduct currently underutilized.  The total Network would have ~ 120GW electrical generating capacity, with an annual generation of ~1,000 TWh.  This would be about 4% of the current ~25,000 TWh total global generation-- a percentage that would decrease over time as the rest of global generation capacity increases.</p><p> </p><p>In summary, the climate impact multipliers we can realize through the collaborative intervention of

you to participate in a local solution for climate change--and one with a big global impact.  It happens right where Energy, Food and Water systems meet, right here in your own neighborhood.  Our solution uses new biomass conversion technology, combined with soil cultivation at local gardens and farms, to generate energy from green-waste, while at the same time moving atmospheric carbon into soil, and accelerating new plant growth.  The Local Carbon Network forces carbon drawdown by transforming the byproducts of urban landscaping, agriculture and forestry into renewable electricity and heat, with long term sequestration of the embedded carbon into soil as Biochar.  In plant biomass, the difficult work of atmospheric CO2 capture has already been solved via photosynthesis, with solar energy helpfully stored during the process.  Unfortunately much of the output we currently call ""waste"" and pay to make it go away, or just let it rot-- sending carbon dioxide and methane back skyward.   The Local Carbon Network leverages this already existing global carbon capture system, connects it with community conversion and sequestration opportunities, and creates a ton of local value beyond climate in the process.  Your purchase and use of Local Carbon Biochar makes this ""refossilization"" of carbon with benefits possible today.
Biochar is Fabulous!Biochar is an accessible way to put this already captured carbon back underground and improve soils in the process.  For those of you new to the concept, Biochar is a specialized form of charcoal that increases plant growth, reduces water usage, prevents fertilizer run off, and fixes carbon in soil.   Whereas raw biomass will quickly rot and go back to atmosphere as carbon based greenhouse gasses, carbon charcoal is stable and will stay in soil for centuries to millennia.  Mixing charcoal into soil is much easier than pumping CO2 underground and trying to keep it there.  And there's a ton of benefits to local energy, food and water systems from doing so. Local Carbon Biochar makes it all happen! Soils around the world have been heavily degraded by Industrial Agriculture over the last 100 years.  Regenerating these soils with biochar and resulting organic matter, is one of the most powerful tools we have to put this atmospheric carbon back into the Earth.  It's a solution that's available today, and with your help, we can grow this solution to the massive scale that is needed-- one Local Food and Carbon neighborhood at a time. 
How you can participateLocal Carbon Cluster- East Bay Area, CaliforniaYou can help close the local carbon cycle through sponsoring bags of Local Carbon Biochar and getting it into soil.  Your sponsorships fund the growth of our flagship Local Carbon Cluster in the East Bay Area of California.  This Cluster is already operating from the headquarters of All Power Labs in Berkeley, and is currently connecting local waste to local reuse and sequestration opportunities in Oakland, Emeryville, Berkeley and Richmond.This campaign will fund a major deployment of All Power Labs conversion machinery at two green-waste processing facilities in the area, significantly expanding the carbon drawdown capabilities of the Local Cluster.   It will also expand the community network needed to direct the ever larger results back into local soil, producing new plant growth and improved local food resources.  Current participating organizations are shown below.  More are invited to join. Local Carbon Biochar sponsors get to choose the community organization where the carbon will be farmed and new plant growth will be enabled.  Alternatively, you can buy some Local Carbon Biochar for yourself and finish the sequestration with your own hands.  Sponsorships can be one time purchases or ongoing memberships with monthly deliveries.  In general, our intent is to replicate the Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) model of regular food box deliveries, through now as Community Supported Carbon Sequestration (CS^2) bags, for ongoing carbon drawdown and progressive improvement of local soils. Each bag of Local Carbon Biochar is 1kg (2.2 lbs) of high quality biochar, ready for mixing with compost and use in soil.  As our bochar is produced on combined energy and biochar conversion machinery, sponsors should expect the following benefits across soil, energy and climate combined bottom lines. Click on one of the Perk options to the right--> for Local Carbon Biochar amounts relevant to enhance potted house plants, a backyard garden, or larger land endeavor.  Each 1kg is appropriate for ~5sqft if you are deep mixing it into soil for new planting, at the common Biochar:Soil mix ratio of 1:10.  If simply spreading it over existing planting, turf or field, each 1kg will cover 20-40sqft.Subscriptions are fulfilled to your sponsor organization or yourself via regular monthly pick-up sites, or mass bulk delivery for larger orders.  Bay Area locals are also invited to join us at the Carbon Farmers' Market at All Power Labs headquarters the second Friday of each month, starting June, 2018.  The APL Carbon Farmer's Market is the best place to pick up your Local Carbon Biochar , see the machinery in operation, and learn from others about biochar use. More ambitious sponsors might consider funding one or more conversion machines for installation at the green-waste source facilities.  Each machine is a $50,000 investment for 25kWh electrical and 50kWh heat + biochar generation capacity. The project will use your sponsored machine for one year to get operations established, then refurbish, upgrade, and return it to you.  Or, if you so choose, All Power Labs can lease it back from you for operations post year one.  Either way, your machine sponsorship will provide the foundation for the East Bay Carbon Cluster, and APL will guarantee an ownership or lease outcome that best suites your needs. 
   
Campaign SizeThe campaign will fund the installation of machinery capable of generating 100kW of electricity and 200kW of heat, with approximately 100kg of green-waste input per hour.  The APL Combined Heat, Power and Carbon (CHPc-) conversion machinery has a retail price of $2 per watt electric, plus $1 per watt balance of system for the site and related implementation costs.  The 100kW power generation and 100kg per hour green-waste processing capacity thus costs a total of $300,000. We are setting the initial goal for the campaign at half this amount ($150,000), with the intent of being able to stretch in the end to the full amount.  If the campaign exceeds this full $300k goal, we'll build additional capacity and operations around the East Bay.  We can easily put to work $1-3M over immediate carbon drawdown project opportunities in the immediate area.All projects have compelling economics for ongoing operations and maintenance.  This campaign will fund the capital costs for equipment and balance of system installation.  Electricity, heat and biochar sales provide the recurring revenue that funds continuing operations, and thus carbon offset and drawdown for many years to come. We Have the TechnologyThe machinery that enables this green-waste to power and sequestration solution is already developed and currently manufactured by All Power Labs (APL) in Berkeley, CA.  The technology is based on the gasification of biomass to produce syngas, then using the syngas to fuel an engine to generate electricity and heat.  The byproduct of gasification is biochar, enabling the return-to-soil of carbon and minerals contained in the original biomass.  The result is Combined Heat and Power with Carbon Sequestration (CHPc-), using the ""waste"" of already captured atmospheric carbon dioxide.     We've been delivering evolving forms of this solution around the world since 2011.  After years of continuous improvement in the crucible of real world use, the technology and product are now solid and ready to scale.  See here for previous APL projects in over 50 countries.This solution is one of the very few carbon negative emissions scenarios that is currently without major technical or economic hurdles remaining to solve before moving to general market.  It's unique in that it's ready to deploy today, at climate relevant numbers and impact.     The Local Carbon Network creates the operational clusters to deploy this innovative technology and complete the green-waste-to-value conversion cycle within local carbon-sheds.  The resulting multiple bottomline benefits accrue locally across economy, environment and people.  Local Carbon FarmersThe Local Carbon Network participant organizations are enthusiastic to receive your sponsored Local Carbon Biochar and put it to good work in soil.  They will reciprocate with a certificate of sequestration, as part of the full transparency and traceability the project offers from carbon source to sink.  Choose your LCN carbon farmer from the list below.

More aggressive scenarios and interventions can push this number into the 50-60CO2e range.  However for a midline starting point, we've taken the 40CO2e common answer, halved it for caution, and suggest a range of possible impacts from 20 to 40CO2e per 1kg Local Carbon Biochar. Elaborating the above impact specifics to the total East Bay campaign plan of 100kW generating capacity, and relatively low hour operation, we can expect the following climate outcomes for each year of the project.  Final run hour goal for the all installations is 7000hrs per year, which will move these numbers up accordingly.  Scaling for Global ImpactThe Local Carbon Network model is designed to be easy to replicate and scale across other Local Food, Farmers' Market and green-waste ecosystems.  The ""proof of concept"" East Bay Carbon Cluster is the template we intend to test and refine, making it easy to pick up for additional Local Carbon Clusters in the US and globally.  APL will orchestrate some of these directly, but also invite others with interest to set things in motion independently in your local area.  Success in this initial East Bay capital campaign fund and deployment will justify follow-on campaigns and deployments dedicated to other Clusters.   APL intends to followup on the East Bay campaign with additional Local Carbon Clusters in California, Italy, Liberia and India.  These areas will be next as projects can build on business and service logistics already established by All Power Labs (APL) in these markets, and demonstration projects already operated to success. After nine years of technology development, business partner establishment, and on-the-ground infrastructure building, APL is ready to make a consequential impact on energy and agriculture transformations in these regions, while drawing down carbon from the global pool during the process.  After nine years of technology development, business partner establishment, and on-the-ground infrastructure building, APL is ready to make a consequential impact on energy, agriculture and climate transformations in these regions.  The goal is to fuel progressive steps towards, and long-term stewardship of, gigawatts of carbon negative power and product deployments, with the ultimate objective of enabling a 10-40ppm impact in global CO2 concentration over the next century.The goal is to fuel progressive and consequential steps towards, and long-term stewardship of, gigawatts of carbon-negative power and product deployments, with the ultimate objective of enabling a 10-40ppm drawdown in global CO2 concentration over the next century. A 10-40ppm drawdown is approximately 10-20% of the carbon reduction that will be needed to maintain global temperature increase below 2˚C, the commonly-accepted point that will stave off catastrophic climate change.  The Numbers at Scale
THE PROBLEM:
At the dawn of the industrial era, atmospheric CO2 levels were ~275ppm.  Largely through burning fossil fuels over the following century plus, we've moved this number to 410ppm.  We're currently trending towards a still very bad best case low of ~500ppm, or a catastrophic high of ~900ppm by year 2,100, depending on our actions in the interimTo not exceed a 2degC temperature rise, we need to stabilize atmospheric CO2 levels around 480ppm.  The longer term responsible state is ~350ppm if we want to ensure climate conditions similar to those present during most of human history.Assuming we succeed in avoiding the fully catastrophic case, we might expect to be in the 500-600ppm CO2 range by 2,100.  As such, we will still need additional carbon offset and drawdown on the order 100-200ppm, to return the Earth atmosphere to a reasonably known and safe equilibrium.  
ONE SOLUTION: In the larger climate management discussion, the Gasification + Biochar solution is part of the “Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Sequestration” or BECCS category of solutions.  However, with biochar the “carbon capture and sequestration” is achieved via simply tilling char into soil, not the difficult process of pumping and storing CO2 gas underground.  The BECCS option plays a major part in nearly all climate planning scenarios that work to recover from the CO2 budget overshoot currently understood as a given in our climate future.  What could the Local Carbon Network do at scale?The screenshot below summarizes a modeled possible future climate impact for the Local Carbon Network, at deployment scales that are attainable with existing industrial/economic dependencies and drivers.  The model considers a total of 60,000 Local Carbon Clusters globally, each operating machinery at 2tonne/hr (2MWe generating capacity) and 70% uptime, over the next century.   The model assumes the LCN ""green-waste to CHPc-"" type solution will rise to become a ongoing solution and general industry beyond All Power Labs.   This of course is premised on a success state where economic drivers make the LCN self propagating and sustainable through decades of project starts and stops, machinery replacements and upgrades, and the general churn of a new product category in the world.    The full live model is here for those who want to dive deeper.At the above average conditions, the outcome of one century of activity is 40ppm total CO2e total impact.  More aggressive entered values can drive the impact up higher, however the current values represent an attempted ""reasonable max"".   Taking this answer, quartering it for good measure, suggests this solution offers a total potential climate impact in the range of 10-40ppm CO2e.  Of course this is caveats all the way down, and now let's start interrogating the model, but as an orientation to what is possible, this is what a well exercised consideration has produced.This 10-40ppm CO2e impact compares to the 100-200ppm CO2e total impact required as summarized above.  While this is well short of the total solution needed for our climate problems, any one scenario that has the potential to contribute even 10+% of the total needed, is a consequential addition to the combined package of climate solutions.  The Local Carbon Network has the potential to be consequential slice of the solution pie. The green-waste required to run such a project is 1.2 billion tonnes per year.  This represents less than 1% of the total yearly terrestrial photosynthetic production on the planet.  Our green-waste resources far exceed this globally.  The US alone has identified 1 billion tonnes of biomass byproduct currently underutilized.  The total Network would have ~ 120GW electrical generating capacity, with an annual generation of ~1,000 TWh.  This would be about 4% of the current ~25,000 TWh total global generation-- a percentage that would decrease over time as the rest of global generation capacity increases. In summary, the climate impact multipliers we can realize through the collaborative intervention of plants, people and machines, are unique and non-trivial in their potential.  Achieving this long-term goal of the Local Carbon Network will be an opportunity for many to benefit from climate positive and profitable work for decades to come. It's up to us to make it happen!",28.0,0,"1 Campaign
