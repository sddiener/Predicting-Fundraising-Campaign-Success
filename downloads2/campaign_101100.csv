We’re passionate about designing travel products that become trusty companions.</p><p> </p><p>We’re building an ecosystem of travel products that work together. We’ve spent the past 2+ years researching &amp; designing travel bags to enhance the way you travel.</p><h3><strong><span>Introducing the Gravel Bag</span> System - Three bags that work as ONE to keep you moving forward.</strong></h3><p>Every day on the move is a bit different - you’ve got to be prepared for what’s next. Some days require bringing a lot of stuff like a rain jacket, camera, water...especially when you’re in a new place. Other days you need to travel light.</p><p>We found ourselves constantly digging through our bags to get stuff in &amp; out. Travel demands quick access &amp; comfort. Unless you’re the kind of person that packs one pair of underwear you should have a bag that’s designed to keep your stuff right by your side &amp; adapt to you while on the move. <strong><span><span>We thought there had to be a better way.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Three products were born to work together:</span><br/><span>42L Carry-On Backpack</span><br/><span>Sling Belt (Hip Belt/Sling Bag)</span><br/><span>11L Day Bag</span></strong></p><p><strong><span>See how they all work together.</span> </strong>Here's a super high level overview of each bag.</p><div data-id=""28584252""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1587422920/axfz4essofwlrz5pmcjw.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""28584294""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1587422921/obboo1nytlxbjuoxssfk.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p><span><strong>42L Carry-On Backpack.</strong></span> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2678/3886/files/gravel.travel.backpack.42L.gif?v=1587663064"" src=""""/></p><p>Pack it all into a plethora of sensible pockets, access it quickly, &amp; stay comfy with adjustable straps &amp; structure.

We’re passionate about designing travel products that become trusty companions. We’re building an ecosystem of travel products that work together. We’ve spent the past 2+ years researching & designing travel bags to enhance the way you travel.Introducing the Gravel Bag System - Three bags that work as ONE to keep you moving forward.Every day on the move is a bit different - you’ve got to be prepared for what’s next. Some days require bringing a lot of stuff like a rain jacket, camera, water...especially when you’re in a new place. Other days you need to travel light.We found ourselves constantly digging through our bags to get stuff in & out. Travel demands quick access & comfort. Unless you’re the kind of person that packs one pair of underwear you should have a bag that’s designed to keep your stuff right by your side & adapt to you while on the move. We thought there had to be a better way.Three products were born to work together:42L Carry-On BackpackSling Belt (Hip Belt/Sling Bag)11L Day BagSee how they all work together. Here's a super high level overview of each bag.42L Carry-On Backpack. Pack it all into a plethora of sensible pockets, access it quickly, & stay comfy with adjustable straps & structure. We'll get into all the juicy details in a moment. Of the Gravel Travel System - this is the home base. Sling Belt. Yes, we made that up.We’re super excited to share our patent pending backpack waist strap that quickly detaches from the 42L Carry-On Backpack & converts to a sling bag. A true 2-in-1. You know when you're trying to get to your seat & you have to stuff your pockets full of all your stuff? We thought it would make sense to just...take off the part of your bag already carrying all that stuff and take it with you!Want to take essentials with you on a day trip exploring? Take it everywhere.
(How the Hip Belt Turns to a Sling)
11L Day Bag. 
More than just your personal item. It packs neatly inside the 42L Carry-On Backpack, attaches on the outside, & is perfect for your expeditions exploring. Carry's multiple ways. Tons of pockets for water, tech to work remote, & then great for all the stuff you need to explore further.Ok! Now we've gotten to know each bag at a high level you probably want to learn more. Video Walkthroughs:How to back this campaign:1. Click ""Back This Project""2. Pick your reward level3. Want to add more bags or accessories to your reward? Check out the graphics at the bottom of the campaign titled ""à la carte"" and increase your pledge amount accordingly. (Shipping for additional items will be collected post Indiegogo via BackerKit surveys )Jump to our FAQ if you need a more detailed answer All three bags work together. We've intentionally made each bag look simple & clean but there is a ton under the hood. Here’s a run-through of each bag.42L Carry-On BackpackIntentional spaces, sensible pockets, & adaptable to fit it all. Let's start with the inside. Stay organized w/soft fleece lined panels & dividers for modular storage. Secure down & compress stuff down w/adjustable cinch straps (sold as a set (2) in the à la carte menu).  14 different loops lining the inside allow you to cinch your stuff the way you want.Laundry Bag Pocket

Mesh Pockets | *Updated design has mesh down the middle :DLet's talk packing & accessing tech/miscellaneous items then start moving to the outside of the bag. Store stuff like a keyboard, charger, USB sticks on the inside panel that fully unzips for easy access & visibility.Secure your laptop in a dedicated laptop pocket that fits up to the new 16"" Macbook Pro. Water bottle pocket stays flat while zipped & unzips partially or fully to fit a 40 Ounce HydroFlask.Pockets on all outside panels of the bag (top, bottom, front, sides). Quick access to stuff like your snacks & water, rain jacket, or a travel adapter.  Front Pocket stows away the 11L Day Bag.Expandable front-pocket for quick access to bigger items like a toiletry bag or day bag.  Great for grabbing liquids for TSA scans.Strap down taller or larger items on the outside like a tripod or a Gravel day bag w/loops on both sides & front w/g-hook straps.  Fully Adjustable For The Right FitThink of the last time you thought “I’m sick of carrying this heavy freakin’ backpack.” We took inspiration from backpacking backpacks & added vertically adjustable shoulder straps for proper fit & weight distribution. Suspension straps to bring load forward to reduce back strain. We also added suspension straps to relieve your shoulders from some of the weight of the backpack. They bring the bag forward to bring the center of mass inward.
Removable rigid backplate, padding, & mesh add comfort and help distribute weight properly. Hovering mesh decreases back sweat and doubles as a roller bag passthrough. 
42L - topSling Belt (Sling Bag/Waist Belt)Everything always by your side. We wanted to reduce the constant digging for stuff like chargers, snacks, wires, passport, AirPods. Hip belts take weight off your back although we thought they should also carry lots of stuff too at your side. Guess what?Our patent pending hip belt carries a ton & transforms to a cross body sling bag. 2L of space w/four pockets (1L & two pockets per side).Here's how easy it is to transform the Hip Belt to a Sling Pack. Unclip while boarding the plane in the aisle and clip to your body. Don’t stop traffic and quickly get to your seat.Stay organized in your seat and stop worrying about losing something. Wraps & secures around seat tray as a caddy for all the airplane seat necessities.Just got to your destination? You're already packed for the day - detach & head out.The hip belt is a standalone sling bag to carry stuff on your trip’s daily excursions.11L Day BagFor day trips when you need a little more stuff we designed a 11 liter day bag. Great for working remotely in a local café then getting out on daily excursions.  Plenty of pockets & tons of space to fit stuff like souvenirs, snacks, water, a camera, or a light jacket. Laptop pocket fits up to a 16"" computer.front welded zipper for stuff that might explode like sunscreen

<p>The <strong>imBAGine </strong>handles all clothing in a single pack. <strong>Clean clothes go in one side, dirty clothes in the other.</strong> The imBAGine is designed to simplify travelling and solve clothes organisation.</p>

<p>You need the imBAGine, an incredible travel pack which stores your clothes and necessities in separate compartments,<strong> making it easy to find what you need, and isolating your clean and dirty clothes without having to worry about the smell or wetness.</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>… and when you get back home, you can just empty the dirty compartment and<strong> dump everything into the washing machine.</strong> And that's it!</p>

<p><strong>Are you tired of packing and unpacking?</strong> Sometimes it’s hard to find something in a pile of travel cubes, and you end up filling up your suitcase with travel cubes instead of souvenirs. On top of that, have to find a bag for your dirty clothes – another unpacking nightmare when you get home!</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>From your last travel experience,</p>
<p>Think about how many travel cubes you had to unpack (it’s even worse when you have kids!); think about your clothes got wrinkled when you picked the wrong size travel cube; think about how many cubes you had to rife through before you could take a shower;</p>

You need the imBAGine, an incredible travel pack which stores your clothes and necessities in separate compartments, making it easy to find what you need, and isolating your clean and dirty clothes without having to worry about the smell or wetness.
 

 
… and when you get back home, you can just empty the dirty compartment and dump everything into the washing machine. And that's it!
 

 
Are you tired of packing and unpacking? Sometimes it’s hard to find something in a pile of travel cubes, and you end up filling up your suitcase with travel cubes instead of souvenirs. On top of that, have to find a bag for your dirty clothes – another unpacking nightmare when you get home!
 

 
From your last travel experience,
Think about how many travel cubes you had to unpack (it’s even worse when you have kids!); think about your clothes got wrinkled when you picked the wrong size travel cube; think about how many cubes you had to rife through before you could take a shower;
imBAGine can ease your life by easing these frustrations!
 

 

 


 

We call it the ""T-partition"". You can separately store your daily necessities in T-partition, so that you can find your desired items anytime, anywhere.
 There's a floating partition in each compartment to completely isolate one side of stuff from another. This way, you can first put your clean clothes into one side of imBAGine at the start of your trip, then move clothes to the dirty side once worn. Upon finishing your journey, all clean clothes will be switched to the dirty side while the size of the imBAGine remains unchanged. Isn't it cool? Simply pull out all dirty clothes from the imBAGine to your washing machine. If you want to separately wash your smelly socks and dirty underwear, just go ahead, we’ve isolated them for you during your whole journey to avoid cross bacterial infection.  Different from other storage bags in the market, the cylindrical shape can effectively keep your clothes in the same position during travel, avoiding wrinkled clothing even after being folded up for a long time. Got sweaty after whole-day trip? No worries! Our compartment for dirty clothes can completely isolate your smelly wet shirts.​Water repellent inner layerThe inner and outer layer of imBAGine are both water repellent, water will bead up on the surface and won't penetrate the other compartment. Water repellent outer layer Got a thicker jumper for winter travel? imBAGine features a zipper that can be opened to extend capacity by 20%! The imBAGine features a built-in band to tie itself up when not in use. It also doubles as a way to quickly spot the side of clean / dirty clothes. Without any bulky buckles or clips, you can easily pack the imBAGine into a small roll after use.

<h3>Keep Us Cool </h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are a family of 3 who, earlier this year, launched our candy business under the brand new California Cottage Food Law.  We've had an overwhelming response and we are growing fast!  Already f<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">our of our candies (Chocolate Fudge, Almond Brittle, Toffee Bark &amp; Salted Chocolate Covered Caramels) have received ribbons, including a 2nd place for our original chocolate fudge that started it all.</span><br/></p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p></p>
<p>We've got some big events coming up in the fall and winter season.   We've already paid for the spots, additional health permits for the locations, insurance and still will need lots of ingredients.  After all of that, there isn't much money left.  </p>
<p>We had a sad and dingy pop-up that was beat up by sun, wear and tear and even some rain.  But the real death of it came in the form of winds.  The frame bent in a few places, bolts bent and a support piece finally broke out.  Some of the rivets are bent beyond repair and one corner is barely hanging on.  It takes tools to put it up and keep it up now. It’s time to replace it with something that better represents our bright and fun personality.</p>
<p>Any funds collected will go directly to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A sturdy 10x10 Red &amp; White Striped Pop-up Tent  </span><br/>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Any additional money over our goal will be applied to any of the following future goals: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Event fees and permits - Varies</span><br/>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">The Impact</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Everyone is so worried these days.  Worried about bills, worried about our future, worried about our figures.  Wouldn't it be great to be a kid again?  </p>
<p>We’d love to bring everyone back to those fun days when they could indulge in real candy!  No substitutions of ingredients you can’t pronounce because “butter and milk is bad for you.”   We use real sugar, real butter and get real flavors.  Old Fashioned candy and Old Fashioned values.  Candy just like grandma used to make.</p>
<p>We do have canned goods and would like to be resourceful in all of our processes. So many have 4, 8 and 16oz jars (ball/mason) just lying around. We would love to bring these back to life rather than getting new each time. The glass jars themselves are infinitely usable as we must cleanse and boil them prior to use each time. Donations of jars (clean and without chips or cracks) would also be appreciated.<br/></p>

<p>It all starts with a little boy growing up eating a chocolate fudge recipe given to his mother by his kindergarten teacher.   He helped make the fudge for years until mom said ""I'm tired…you make it!""   It sparked an interest in deserts (read created a chocoholic) and so he expanded on that recipe and learned to make more sweets for himself.  </p>
<p>As an adult, when times were thin, he decided candy was a great way to give family and friends Christmas gifts (maybe in an attempt to keep those family and friends from getting thin, themselves).  They were such a hit, the next year people complained about getting regular gifts again. And from there it flourished because like us, our friends wanted candy year-round.  He knew he had something!</p>
<p>Today the candy recipes have expanded to include so much more than just chocolate.  OK let's face it; it's still a lot of chocolate.  And now it’s his family of 3 that get to share in the candy making.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We look forward to
sharing our candy with you and your friends and family!</p>

We are a family of 3 who, earlier this year, launched our candy business under the brand new California Cottage Food Law.  We've had an overwhelming response and we are growing fast!  Already four of our candies (Chocolate Fudge, Almond Brittle, Toffee Bark & Salted Chocolate Covered Caramels) have received ribbons, including a 2nd place for our original chocolate fudge that started it all.

We've had great success at fairs and festivals in the past few months.  We've already paid to do a dozen more events this year and have been accepted into a local Farmer's Market.  Sadly, our Pop-Up tent has pooped out!   Wind and use has bent most of the upper support.   We need a new one to keep our gooey chocolate candies (and us) from melting in the endless California sun.  
http://www.thekandyjar.com/



What We Need 

We've got some big events coming up in the fall and winter season.   We've already paid for the spots, additional health permits for the locations, insurance and still will need lots of ingredients.  After all of that, there isn't much money left.  
We had a sad and dingy pop-up that was beat up by sun, wear and tear and even some rain.  But the real death of it came in the form of winds.  The frame bent in a few places, bolts bent and a support piece finally broke out.  Some of the rivets are bent beyond repair and one corner is barely hanging on.  It takes tools to put it up and keep it up now. It’s time to replace it with something that better represents our bright and fun personality.
Any funds collected will go directly to:



A sturdy 10x10 Red & White Striped Pop-up Tent  


Accessories: in the form of Weights  & Walls to combat the wind and sun




Any additional money over our goal will be applied to any of the following future goals: 



Event fees and permits - Varies


A new mixer - $400

Website redesign - $50+/hr

More Chocolate Molds - $400


New 4 burner stove – $1400


Dishwasher - $1000

Kitchen Remodel for storage and function - ????






What You Get

As a campaign contributor, you can receive perks such as a



Our heartfelt thanks

Recipe Cards

Handmade wooden toys


Award winning candy


Recognition as one of our contributors on our
webpage


And more…



If
we do not reach our entire goal, we will still use the funds to help us do as
much as we can.






The Impact

Everyone is so worried these days.  Worried about bills, worried about our future, worried about our figures.  Wouldn't it be great to be a kid again?  
We’d love to bring everyone back to those fun days when they could indulge in real candy!  No substitutions of ingredients you can’t pronounce because “butter and milk is bad for you.”   We use real sugar, real butter and get real flavors.  Old Fashioned candy and Old Fashioned values.  Candy just like grandma used to make.
We do have canned goods and would like to be resourceful in all of our processes. So many have 4, 8 and 16oz jars (ball/mason) just lying around. We would love to bring these back to life rather than getting new each time. The glass jars themselves are infinitely usable as we must cleanse and boil them prior to use each time. Donations of jars (clean and without chips or cracks) would also be appreciated.


Who are we?



http://www.thekandyjar.com/
It all starts with a little boy growing up eating a chocolate fudge recipe given to his mother by his kindergarten teacher.   He helped make the fudge for years until mom said ""I'm tired…you make it!""   It sparked an interest in deserts (read created a chocoholic) and so he expanded on that recipe and learned to make more sweets for himself.  
As an adult, when times were thin, he decided candy was a great way to give family and friends Christmas gifts (maybe in an attempt to keep those family and friends from getting thin, themselves).  They were such a hit, the next year people complained about getting regular gifts again. And from there it flourished because like us, our friends wanted candy year-round.  He knew he had something!
Today the candy recipes have expanded to include so much more than just chocolate.  OK let's face it; it's still a lot of chocolate.  And now it’s his family of 3 that get to share in the candy making.


We look forward to
sharing our candy with you and your friends and family!

</h3>
</div><div> <p>Gas is expensive. Even more so when you're rolling around in a Jeep Wrangler (what, you thought we'd take a car to some of the most remote and rugged parts of Oregon? Please!). What we need is simply some money to offset our gas and travel costs. To that end, we're asking for <b>$1500</b>, and in exchange, we'll be giving you guys beautiful, high-quality canvas prints of our photos in return! You will not only have the satisfaction of helping us out immensely, you'll receive beautiful, gallery-style artwork at prices FAR below what you would normally expect to pay for such pieces.</p>
<p>Our $1500 goal is <i>JUST</i> enough to cover the cost of our travel expenses and pay for the actual prints (Remember, these things aren't cheap! The prints alone will take up a very sizable portion of that $1500 goal.). Hitting that goal alone will be a huge blessing, but of course artists like Matt and me can ALWAYS use some additional funding. Cameras, lenses, software, and accessories are NOT cheap, and neither is driving to the most remote parts of the country to find a dark sky or a scenic view. So, if you guys can help us blow right past that goal, it will help insure that we're able to continue bringing you beautiful photos in the future and give us a head start on our next big astrophotography excursion.</p>
<h2>The Canvases</h2>
<p>The canvases we'll be sending all of you as perks are 1.5"" gallery wrapped and come with hanging-hardware pre-installed, so they'll be ready for you to throw up on your wall as soon as they arrive. Shipping is <b>FREE</b> within the lower 48 states. Outside of that, some additional shipping charges may be required.</p>
<p>We're offering quite a few different sizes and pricing options, as well as quite a few different customization options, <b>so please read this section and our perk descriptions thoroughly before selecting one!</b></p>

<blockquote><i>Pictured above: a 1.5"" gallery-wrapped canvas.</i></blockquote> </div> <div> <p>The way that this fundraiser works is that you will pre-order your canvas, then after Matt and me return and start editing the photos we took and posting watermarked preview images of them online, you'll be able to choose ANY of them that you would like . When the time comes for you to pick an image, we'll walk you through the process of deciding on an image, picking an orientation, choosing a border style, and any other options that you may have decided on.</p>
<h4><b>Sizes and Options:</b></h4>
<p>The canvas sizes that we are offering are as follows:</p>
<p>8"" x 10""<br/>11"" x 14""<br/>16"" x 20""<br/>18"" x 24""</p>
<p>In addition to single canvases, we're also offering two, three, and four-canvas splits. Multi-canvas splits are singular images that are split across multiple canvases (Of course, you're also welcome to simply request multiple images instead of a split if you so desire). They're a great and very unique way to showcase a large panorama. Below is an example of a three-canvas split.</p>

<blockquote>A two-row four-canvas split and a one-row four-canvas split.</blockquote>
<h4><b>Photo Orientation and Borders:</b></h4>
<p>No matter which size or how many canvases you pick, you will be able to choose whether you want your pictures to be in landscape or portrait orientation, as well as the style of border you want on the canvas. If you don't already understand the difference between the landscape and portrait orientations, below is a nifty little photo demonstrating the difference. As you can see, which orientation you should choose depends on the content of a photo.</p>

<blockquote>On the left, ""landscape."" On the right, ""portrait.""</blockquote>The canvas border option you choose determines what the 1.5-inch-thick border of your image will look like. You can choose between simply having the image wrap around the edges, a mirrored version of the image wrap around the edges, the colors at the edges of the image extending around the edge and blurring, or a solid color edge. The simple image wrap is probably the most traditional, but personally I tend to prefer using a black solid-colored edge for astrophotography. The choice, however, is all yours!<p></p>

<blockquote>Some examples of the many border styles you can choose!</blockquote>
<h4>Custom Text:</h4>
<p>If you'd like to add an inspiration quote, a Bible verse, a song lyric, or a short poem to one of our canvases, you can do that! The cost to add text to a print is <b>$25/canvas</b>, and we will work with you to make sure that the font, size, color, shading, and positioning of the text are all to your liking.</p>
<p>As you can see, this perk is separate from all the other perks, and does <i><b>NOT</b></i> come with a canvas on it's own. To use it, you must purchase both it AND at least one canvas. If that seems confusing, let me explain:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to get a single 16"" x 20"" canvas with your favorite Bible verse on it, you would purchase both the $80 ""16x20 Canvas Print"" perk AND the $25 ""Custom Text"" perk for a total cost of $105.</li>
<li>If you want to add a famous quote to one panel of a three-canvas-split, you would purchase both a three-canvas-split perk and ONE ""Custom Text"" perk.</li>
<li>If you want to add song lyrics to all four panels of a four-canvas-split, you will need to purchase both a four-canvas-split perk and FOUR custom text perks.</li>

<div>
</div>
<p>Our founder, Rob Law, launched the Trunki ride-on suitcase
on reality TV 10 years ago, but left the Dragons Den (Shark Tank to our American
cousins) humiliated and empty handed. However the public saw through it and
were hugely supportive, their overwhelming backing has enabled us to sell over
2.8 million Trunki suitcases worldwide. <a href=""http://www.trunki.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trunki.com</a></p>
<div>
</div>
<p>We’ve taken to Indiegogo to launch our second product,
Jurni, on a global scale. We really believe consumers have the power to decide
what’s a great product and can genuinely help shape its development before it
launches. We'd like to harness this power for the launch of Jurni, which aims
to bring  the same rewarding experience
Trunki gives to travelling tots, but this time to the next generation of
travellers. </p>
<div>
</div>
<p>By backing us on Indiegogo you'll get one of the very
first Jurni suitcases! You'll also be able to help us refine future products
and together we can ­make any journey a breeze.</p>

</div>
<p>We have already invested in full manufacture setup and
we've robust experience after producing 2.8 million ride-on suitcases. However,
with any new product launch there are always challenges, but we believe we have
overcome the most significant ones over our 4 year development period. We've
ironed out critical problems at prototype stage and we're currently making minor
improvements to tooled injection moulded samples, ready for trial production.</p>
<div>
</div>
<p>We are currently undergoing rigorous product durability,
compliance and safety testing. This could flag up an unforeseen issue which
may require further modification to our design. We believe our timeline takes
into account minor issues and are confident with our shipping timeline but we
can’t exclude needing to make revisions.</p>

Design




Good physical product design, is at the heart of Jurni; we
didn’t build in electronic gadgets and gizmos, or develop an app – all of which
would drive up cost, complexity and become obsolete very quickly. 









We built hundreds of prototypes and ironed out the
technical challenges whilst styling its form, to be both streamlined and
functional - resulting in a product that is really slick, stylish and
intuitive, yet fully ‘manufacturable’.




Check out more product photography on our gallery page 
We
collaborated with industry leading engineers to create a super-strong but
incredibly light structure; we call it the i-Beam and it's patented design can
take up to 220lb (100kg) of sitting load.



















Timeline
Jurni is now in production and SHIPPING NOW






Why Indiegogo?










Our founder, Rob Law, launched the Trunki ride-on suitcase
on reality TV 10 years ago, but left the Dragons Den (Shark Tank to our American
cousins) humiliated and empty handed. However the public saw through it and
were hugely supportive, their overwhelming backing has enabled us to sell over
2.8 million Trunki suitcases worldwide. trunki.com


We’ve taken to Indiegogo to launch our second product,
Jurni, on a global scale. We really believe consumers have the power to decide
what’s a great product and can genuinely help shape its development before it
launches. We'd like to harness this power for the launch of Jurni, which aims
to bring  the same rewarding experience
Trunki gives to travelling tots, but this time to the next generation of
travellers. 


By backing us on Indiegogo you'll get one of the very
first Jurni suitcases! You'll also be able to help us refine future products
and together we can ­make any journey a breeze.

Risks and Challenges





We have already invested in full manufacture setup and
we've robust experience after producing 2.8 million ride-on suitcases. However,
with any new product launch there are always challenges, but we believe we have
overcome the most significant ones over our 4 year development period. We've
ironed out critical problems at prototype stage and we're currently making minor
improvements to tooled injection moulded samples, ready for trial production.


We are currently undergoing rigorous product durability,
compliance and safety testing. This could flag up an unforeseen issue which
may require further modification to our design. We believe our timeline takes
into account minor issues and are confident with our shipping timeline but we
can’t exclude needing to make revisions.






FAQs




Where can I buy Jurni?
Were now shipping internationally from www.myjurni.com
What's the upper age limit? There is none, however the seat load must not exceed 220 lb (100 kg) 


What's the lower age limit We recommend a minimum height of 120 cm so as to maximise stability when sitting or gliding.


How is Jurni up gradable? We designed Jurni with upgradability in mind. So to fit spare parts or future upgrades, you can simply unscrew 4 custom bolts inside the Jurni base. This releases the scuff board, which provides access to change the wheels, add a new door,  and a new telescopic handle. The scuff board can get worn with heavy use so its easily replaced too!


Is the Pod waterproof? It's light shower-proof. If using in heavy rain, keep electronics in a water tight place. 


What tablets fit in the Pod? Designed to fit an iPad mini, the Pod’s internal width is 10.2” (L) x 5.3” (W) x 2.3”
(H) : 260mm x 135mm x 59mm , do check the width of your tablet








Can Jurni be checked in? It's designed to be used as hand luggage, however it can only be checked in using the Jurni check in strap, available for purchase separately.


Why is there not a charger built in? If we built in a charger, it would cost several times more than buying one on the open market and it's highly likely you already own a portable charger, plus they can become obsolete quickly with better capacity ones coming out constantly! Most portable chargers will easily fit in the quick access pod.

Jurni will come with a 2 year guarantee (warranty).

We are looking for donors to come alongside us both prayerfully and financially.  Anything helps from $10 to $1000 :)  Plus you get some pretty sweet perks :)What do the funds go to?The total sum of our collective trip is $5700, but we are starting with a goal of raising $3000. Why you ask? Because this platform is a fixed funding campaign, meaning we do not receive any funds unless we hit our goal 100%. Scary but an exciting risk.So we wanted to start small and work our way up!  And we only have 30 days to do it! If we do hit $3000 within the timeframe, our next goal will be another $1000 ($4000 total). If we hit that we will go for the total sum of $5700!Donations given go completely to trips costs which cover team supplies, training materials, lodging, local transportation and airfare. Donations are securely collected via credit cards or PayPal Accounts.The Vision:What exactly will we be doing during our two weeks in Trinidad?We will be doing two main things1. Establish a Green Cross Crisis Center  (trainings)The Green Cross is the trauma/mental health version of the Red Cross.  They respond to natural disasters and local community crises around the world. The Green Cross says ""the mission is to transform victims into survivors.""  Like Haiti, Trinidad is susceptible to much of the same natural disasters.  That coupled with an impoverished infrastructure makes Trinidad particular vulnerable to crisis.  Our hope and plan is to partner with the local officials and the community in establishing Trinidad's first Green Cross center. We will be training officials during these two weeks, equipping them to be prepared for potential threats.  Our plan is to leave behind a fully functional Green Cross center to the benefit of Trinidad.2. Counseling individuals affected by trauma:Missy and Michelle have been taking specialized training in trauma and crisis counseling (classes such psychological first aid, traumatized families and children, and grief and loss) since last fall. All with the aim of preparing for this trip and becoming certified Traumatologists.  We will be going on site to locations such as prisons, orphanages, and inner city community centers in Trinidad. We will be counseling those affected by trauma such as  domestic violence, sexual abuse, crime, etc in both group and individual settings.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, I’m the designer of Alpha Pillow. Having noticed various problems in the recent travel pillow market, I decided to design a multifunctional neck pillow for travelers, white-collar workers and anybody who may need it. I have rich experience in designing various kinds of inflatable products, including inflatable couch, inflatable chair and air mattress. One of these products was “the top 1 product of sale” of French Amazon Prime Day 2017. Alpha Pillow is a thoughtful present that I hope will bring comfort and convenience to you.</p>

Our brand concept is based on “Making Travel Easier”, and we advocate that outdoor activities should adhere to the notion of being environmentally-friendly, comfortable, stylish and convenient.

<p>The purpose of running an Indiegogo campaign is that we understand what problems our customers are facing with travel pillows, and we hope to produce one that may eliminate these pain points in the travel pillow market. We found out that traditional inflatable pillows require users to make direct contact with the inflating valve, which may arouse great concern during the COVID-19 pandemic period, and it always costs users a very long time to fully inflate the pillow through the valves. Therefore, we are committed to producing a neck pillow that can be easily inflated but is also contactless. Moreover, we want to design a neck pillow that can fit in various scenarios, rather than for a journey merely. So, Alpha Pillow is designed with multifunctionality which can be used during your travel, in your office or at home.</p>

</div></div>","Travels are supposed to be enjoyable, so why bother to struggle with those inferior pillows and miss the landscapes with regrets.
You need a neck pillow that can leave these worries behind and
make your journey count.

  Let’s check out how Alpha Pillow is inflated!It is energy-saving. Inflate your pillow with only ONE breath. Blow towards the large opening, and the funnel-like film will collect all your breath at once. Also the magnetic seal ensures no air slip away. Then push and roll up the magnetic seal to get the pillow firm and set. It’s time to say goodbye to leakage.It is hygienic. Instead of taking mouth-to-mouth inflation with a valve, the way of inflating Alpha Pillow keeps you away from any health risks caused by contact. Open and hold the seal away with your mouth, blow air into the pillow, no more contact with the valves.The two arms in unequal length after inflation allows you to set up a phone holder on the longer arm in the middle, which ensures the most favorable distance for watching a movie.Sit back and relax while your favorite pillow takes care of entertainment during your trip.  Your Alpha Pillow can become a desk pillowduring your naptime.After a busy morning, your body needs some energy recharging. Alpha Pillow can help you take a more efficient rest. Gently place it on the table surface, squeeze the longer arm downward to let it support your chest, then just fall asleep with your pillow. The patented design can alleviate the numbness and pain caused by the hard edges of the table. The breathable pillowcase makes it even more comfortable!Put on the Lycra pillowcase for a more comfortable rest experience. The ice silk texture of the pillowcase allows you to feel the softest and the smoothest contact with the pillow. The breathability of the pillowcase ensures your personal hygiene. Have it cleaned by detaching the pillowcase and throwing it into the washing machine.  Ultimate comfort with the smart ergonomic design!The slim design of the supportive part for your neck can decrease the pressure posed on your back neck and your cervical spine, which provides you with customized comfort. Two thick arms of the pillow, which you can hold with your arms crossed can offer you a sense of security during the journey.Deflation is as easy as the process of inflation.When you want to deflate the pillow, just open the seal and pull out the thin film, and press the pillow from one side to another to let the air escape. Then, you can put everything together, and store it in the bag, which is super compact to carry with. Yes, Alpha Pillow can be repaired.If your Alpha Pillow is accidentally punctured, there’s no need to panic. After you deflate the pillow, you can turn it inside out. Find where the puncture or cut is and attach a “self-adhesive” pad to it. Turn it back, and it looks no different from the original one. All is done! Nice and easy.Alpha Pillow is a real multifunctional pillow.In addition to the functionalities as a personal neck pillow, a stable phone holder and a comfortable desk pillow, there are a sleep mask and a pair of earplugs that ensure you obtain tranquility and peace during your rests. It is so versatile that can meet your needs of using it in different scenarios.Choose your favorite color from Grey, Green, Blue, Purple & Orange.

Hi, I’m the designer of Alpha Pillow. Having noticed various problems in the recent travel pillow market, I decided to design a multifunctional neck pillow for travelers, white-collar workers and anybody who may need it. I have rich experience in designing various kinds of inflatable products, including inflatable couch, inflatable chair and air mattress. One of these products was “the top 1 product of sale” of French Amazon Prime Day 2017. Alpha Pillow is a thoughtful present that I hope will bring comfort and convenience to you.


We are EasierHike and we are the manufacturer of Alpha Pillow. By cooperating with talented designers, we have produced various outdoor sports equipment which is broadly welcomed by the market. Our brand concept is based on “Making Travel Easier”, and we advocate that outdoor activities should adhere to the notion of being environmentally-friendly, comfortable, stylish and convenient. Alpha Pillow is one of our favorite products, and we hope you may also favor it as we do.


The purpose of running an Indiegogo campaign is that we understand what problems our customers are facing with travel pillows, and we hope to produce one that may eliminate these pain points in the travel pillow market.

Refined and improved from our Sea to Sky backpack is its strategic and detachable hip pack system, improved sternum and waist straps, and additional support structure for added comfort and storage. The Alta 21 is the perfect tool no matter what adventure you're on.Available in 3 colors:  Here are some steps that you should know on how to order: The Alta 21 has over 20 features packed into a pouch smaller than the size of your palm. It's ultra-lightweight meaning you can pack this into any of your travels for those times you need a technical daypack for your travels or adventures.100% Waterproof Compartment Each Alta 21 has a built in, 100% waterproof compartment, doubling as a dry sack. The outer shell is lined with Durable Waterproof Cordura® fabric - this helps to keep your electronics and clothes dry whatever the situation. Rain, Snow, Mud, Lakes, Oceans.Fits In Your Hand - Compression Cordura® Pouch The 21 Litre Alta packs down to fit in the palm of your hands. With the newly improved compression stuff sack, you'll be able to get the bag in and out within seconds. We've also added some carry loops so this Pouch can carry other small essentials when it's not carrying the Alta 21. Detachable 3L Hip Pack Each pack comes with a built in detachable 3L Hip Pack. It's multi-pockets and mesh lined backing is designed for when you only need to carry the essentials. Whether you're on your morning jog, trip down to the market, or skiing down the slopes, we're sure you'll find use with the hip pack.Inflatable Back SupportWe wanted to give the bag structure and additional comfort for certain activities. With the inflatable back support you'll be able to create a more rigid bag when you need it and take it out when you don't. Designed also to be ultra-lightweight and allow airflow to travel between your back and the bag.Seat Cushion / PillowLong day? No where to sit? The Inflatable Back Support is also built to double as a seat cushion or a head rest for when you need it the most. We're including one with every Alta 21 Pack.Hidden Hydration / Accessories Compartment We added a hydration compartment due to popular requests! It's separated from the Inflatable Back Support with a waterproof Cordura® divider so you can use both the Hydration Pack and the Inflatable back support at the same time. The space is also large enough to fit a 13"" laptop.Zipper Lid Open - Easy Access To Main CompartmentGet access to the main compartment quick and easily with the new zipper lid open. The top opens and closes like a regular bag with the smooth YKK® zippers. We added this so you don't always have to use the Roll Top close when using the bag. Use this method when you don't need 100% waterproofing inside the main compartment. Watertight Zippers - YKK Aquaseal®Newly added YKK Aquaseal® zippers to ensure heavy rain stays out of your quick access pockets. The zipper colors had also been chosen to accentuate vibrant colors of the bag.  Easy Access Front Pocket The front pockets allow you to easily reach your small essentials when you need it. Great for keeping your pen, notebook, maps, keys etc. Deep 9.5"" Expandable Mesh Pockets These mesh pockets expand when you need them and retract to stay flush against the bag when you don't. Deep enough to hold any sized water bottle, shoe, or whatever you decide to stash in these pockets  - you can be sure whatever you decide to put in here isn't going to fall out.   Durable 30D Cordura® Material 30D Cordura® material is some of the lightest, yet most durable materials on the market. It's rip resistant, tear resistant, and 100% waterproof, meaning you can use the Alta 21 the way it was meant to be used. Built for adventure. Removable Sternum Straps (Improved)We've improved the ITW® Sternum Straps to ensure a more secure fit on the bag so it doesn't fall off. The increased thickness of the straps give the bag a more secure fit when you're on the move. We've also kept them removable for when they're not in use.Removable Waist Straps (Improved) We've improved the ITW® Waist Straps to a thicker strap - this will help to steady the bag from swaying side to side while feeling more secure. Removable for when you don't need it.95dB Safety Whistle A cool 95db ITW® whistle used to annoy your friends or maybe in case of emergencies.  Expandable Waterproof Roll Top Closure Need extra space? Remove the detachable Hip Pack and give yourself 2L of additional space to pack your gear in. The roll top closure will ensure all your items in the bag stay 100% dry, even with the Hip Pack removed.      In 2017, The Pacific Northwest Co. was born with the help of the Kickstarter community. The Sea to Sky Pack was created and went on to thousands of adventures. We have been so humbled by your continued support and how far you have brought us from our first Kickstarter days.We are excited to start this new journey with you as we evolve our brand name to Arkadia. Derived from the Arc that Cascadia (aka: Pacific Northwest) forms around us to create our backyard. Arkadia is where our inspiration for our products sprout, purposefully designed gear for the modern adventurer.

Thought up by hardcore hikers and brought to life by veteran fashion designers, Apricoat is the apex of 10 years of adventure travel and material design. The perfect jacket for exploring anything from a rainforest to an urban jungle.        DWD: Differential Weight DistributionApricoat's unique design layout evenly distributes the weight of whatever's in your pockets to feel empty
 Inflatable Hood PillowEasily inflate your hood and rest your head anywhere  Built-in Sleeve GlovesRolls out to keep your hands nice and cozy   
         Why are we so confident? We've already been wearing the apricoat for a little while, and we know just how great it is. We also have our post-campaign map already handled, and we're working with experienced partners that tell us what to expect. Not to mention (OK, we'll mention it) one of our co-founders is an experienced textile manufacturer with over 5 years of experience doing just this in a variety of ways.We've also tested Apricoat all over the world, so we're confident no matter where you are, you'll be quite pleased with it. Apricoat comes fully warranted against defects in materials and workmanship with a 1 year guarantee. Damage caused by improper use is not covered.    We've sourced some awesome gear to include in a fully loaded apricoat. They arrive already snug in their respective pockets. That way you can just put it on and get exploring.     Please note: The measurements below are of the jacket itself, measured whilst flat. In order to find your size follow the instructions below. How to measureBack length (center): Measure from neck down to the end of the back.

Anything that acts as a home to so much wildlife deserves some attention. Especially when some of that wildlife is endangered. Bringing attention to the parks means bringing attention to those creatures who can’t speak for themselves.National Parks are public lands, that means they’re not owned by the government, they’re owned by each and every one of us. And it’s up to us to care for them and spread the word. These parks should not be taken for granted, they need to be visited, explored, and loved.America’s parks are beautiful from one end of the country to the other, and we want everyone to experience that beauty firsthand.    Newverest is launching a unique National Parks Scratch Off Poster! Visit a national park, scratch it off your poster, and keep track of your travels while planning future ones. Newverest includes an easy-to-use scratch tool with every poster that makes scratching away the outer layer of foil easy. Think of the National Parks Scratch Off Poster as your bucket list of National Parks. Once you get the poster, you can use it to plan which parks you want to visit. Every time you take a trip, scratch away the outer layer from the picture to reveal the hidden colors beneath. It’s a fun way to keep track of all the parks you visit.  Each poster also includes a set of 62 beautiful cards, one for each of the National Parks. Like our poster, the cards are all hand-painted by artists. Flip the card over and read an interesting fact about the park you’ve just gotten back from, or the one you plan to see next.   Ready to plan your next trip? Use your poster for inspiration. One quick look will tell you the places you have yet to go to. Take a look and see which National Parks appeal to you most, then start planning your trip.When you return, your scratch poster acts like a memories keepsake better than any trinket you might pick up on your trip. Get your poster framed with the Newverest frame and hang it on the wall, and the memories of your National Park adventure will always be within sight.   We want everyone to see that our National Parks are National Treasures and inspire everyone to visit as many as they can. There are many reasons why you need a National Parks Poster. Here are the top 5.    We were inspired by the natural beauty of the parks, worked with our team of artists who hand-painted real scenes from each individual park using watercolor paint.                             

Scratch Off National Park Poster. The poster features a fresh new design. Each hand-painted picture encapsulates the idyllic and singular ‘personality’ of each park.

<h1><strong>Welcome Home!</strong></h1>
<p>Hosted at a private country house about <strong>an hour outside London</strong> over <strong>August 16th to 18th</strong> this year, The Summer House is a marvellously magical experience like no other. It starts a bit like a retreat - workshops, sessions, talks, treatments, games, swimming - and crescendoes into a private house party featuring fabulous performances, music, dancing, storytelling and late-night conversations in front of the log fire. With plenty of opportunities to learn together, dine together and play together, The Summer House is not only a great party but also a place to make meaningful and lasting connections.</p>
<p>When you come to The Summer House you're more than just a guest: <strong>you're part of an extended family of friends-of-friends</strong>. You're home. We believe in inclusivity, respect and community-building - because we want everyone to feel equally free to participate and express themselves. </p>

<p>As you can see, this crowdfunding campaign has hit its <strong>minimum</strong> target. First of all, <strong>thanks</strong> to everyone who has pledged so far and who has helped spread the word. We're grateful for and touched by your enthusiastic support. We said from <strong>the start</strong> that the minimum target would only cover the <strong>basic</strong> infrastructure of the event (as shown on the first budget sheets below.)<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The full budget is £30,000 so we still need your pledges! </strong>In crowdfunding it's allowed to overshoot the minimum and raise more funds during the campaign, which is what we need your help in achieving so that we can secure the more fancy elements like performance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Why pledge now rather than wait?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.whitemischief.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/whypledgenowratherthanwait.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>For you: </strong>Pledging <strong>now</strong> enables you to get the <strong>cheapest possible prices</strong> with no booking fees. These are £65 for Saturday night, £80 for Saturday day onwards, and £90 for the whole weekend. Also, if you pledge now you get access to all the <strong>perks</strong> (see the list further down the page), which includes an invitation to a special celebratory get-together in London in July and a crowdfunders' drinks at the House on Friday 16th August. </p>
<p>The prices <strong>after</strong> the crowdfunding campaign will definitely be <strong>quite a bit higher, </strong>with booking fees.</p>
<p><strong>For us:</strong> Every penny that is pledged during this crowdfunding campaign will go <strong>directly into improving the event</strong> with extras like performance, music, extra workshops shown in the second budget sheet below. The more that gets pledged now, the more easily we can <strong>guarantee</strong> certain items from the second budget will be at the event. Plus, the more accurately we can predict the final numbers, which will mean a better-organised event all round.</p>

<p><strong>Food</strong><span>: If camping you may bring and cook your own food, but please no open fires. Alternatively you can feast with the food prepared by our team of chefs. A more conventional page will open up for booking dining once the crowdfunding campaign is complete.<br/><br/>A hearty dinner will be served on Friday night and a delicious summer dinner of salads and soups on Saturday night (cost approximately £30 per head per night). A rustic breakfast will be served on Saturday and Sunday mornings (cost around £10 per head). There are about three dinner servings per night; guests serve themselves from the banqueting table and can eat together - outside if the weather is good, inside if not. We can cater to vegans, vegetarians and those with dietary requirements, if given notice. In addition, independent street food chefs will supply healthy meals, tea, coffee and ice cream all day every day with meals at under £10 each. Unless included in your reward, food costs extra. </span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Transport: </strong>Getting to and from the House is easy. To ensure privacy and security, we do not publish the address of the House until 1-2 weeks before the party. It is approximately 35-45 minutes from London Waterloo by train on the line to Portsmouth. Or by car (close to A3/M3/M25) 40 miles / 75 minutes from central London. There is car parking at the house. Gates open 14:00 on Friday and close at 17:00 on Sunday. No arrivals after 22:00 Friday or 21:00 Saturday. If you need to book trains in advance please contact us and we will advise.</p>
<p>At peak times we will provide a <strong>shuttle minibus</strong> between the local station and the House (£5 charge). Also, we will charter <strong>coaches</strong> to transport guests from central London to the House on Friday lunchtime, Friday evening, Saturday morning and Saturday evening. There will be <strong>coaches back to London</strong> at 03:00 Sunday morning and 17:00 Sunday afternoon. Unless included in your pledge package, the coach will be charged separately. We can't confirm exact prices yet but they are likely to be £15 return, ie cheaper than the train.</p>

<p><strong>Accommodation</strong>: Four accommodation options are available:</p>

<p><strong>• Glamping </strong>- sleep in a splendid 5m canvas bell tent from Blue Bell Tents, with bedding for 2, 3 or 4 people plus light and mirror, pitched ready for your arrival. Or a Shikar tent which is more like a room you can stand up in, complete with hanging rails and furniture. These will be available shortly priced £245 for two.</p>
<p><strong>• Self-camping</strong> - no cost - pitch your own tent in the grounds of the house (we encourage you to decorate your camp!) No cars in camping area - campervans may set up in their own zone in the nearby parking field. We provide toilets, showers, running water at no extra cost.</p>
<p><strong>• Local hotel / B&amp;B</strong> - While we would prefer for you to stay on site, we will of course provide a list of local hotels and B&amp;Bs to all guests who pledge.</p>

<p><strong style=""font-size: 2em;"">Tickets and perks</strong></p>
<p>If you want to come to the event, a pledge of £65 will get you in on Saturday night; £80 on Saturday daytime onwards; and £90 all weekend. The Indiegogo tickets are the cheapest possible ""Earlybird"" prices, with no booking fee, and include various perks as detailed below.</p>
<p>After the crowdfunding campaign, expect prices to go up to something like £75 for the Saturday night and £125 for the whole weekend. Please note that your pledges are in your name, non-refundable and the perks cannot be transferred to other guests, other events or other times.</p>
<p>All pledges of £25 or £50 include the reward of upgrading to a ticket at the Indiegogo prices any time up to July 8. It's like a part-payment!</p>
<p><span>Some of the other perks do not come with tickets, so make sure you read the information under each perk package. if you want more than one perk, all you have to do is contribute to more than one option!</span></p>
<p><strong>""THE BACKERS' PACK"" </strong>is a pack of perks included in all pledges of £65 and above and features: Invitation to a celebratory London get-together in July • A Summer House badge • Your name or nickname as a credit on our website • Updates on the project • Access to a secret feedback group • A pack of music downloads from artists who have performed White Mischief • A pack of photo downloads from previous White Mischief events • Wallpaper downloads featuring Summer House illustrations • A memento book PDF inspired by the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>BUT you don't need to attend the Weekend to pledge! </strong>You can pledge any amount you like and you can choose the option marked ""No perk, I just want to contribute"". You can also pledge on someone else's behalf if they can't afford it themselves.</p>

<p>By default, Indiegogo lists the names of backers who make a pledge. If you want to remain anonymous so that your pledge is not seen by others, you can choose to make an anonymous pledge or you can give a different backer name.</p>
<p>Only we the organisers see your real name. We won't pass on or share the details of people who pledge without their express permission. We are also happy with guests using nicknames in public spaces. But if you are attending the Weekend we will need for you to give your true identity to us in advance as our door / accreditation staff will be checking photo ID on arrival.</p>

<p>None of us on the team is wealthy, so we do sympathise! Putting on an intimate independent weekend like works out more expensive, per person, than a corporate enterprise with guests in their thousands or tens of thousands. The entry price you see in these pledge packages is as low as we can make it. There are no hidden booking fees or camping charges for you...and every penny from the pledge goes into the event costs. We feel that the value compares well to other weekends this summer.</p>
<p>But we understand there will always be some people who can't commit the full amount. So we offer a Saturday night only option, which is a little cheaper and allows you to enjoy the climax of things. We also offer a sort of part-payment scheme, so that anyone who pledges £25 or £50 in the crowdfunding campaign gets the power to upgrade to the earlybird price ticket by July 8.</p>
<p>If you're in dire financial straits, please pledge what you can now, even if it's just a pound, to help us towards the campaign target. (If you don't have a bank card please post a message here on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheSummerHouseWeekend"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our Facebook page</a> so we can register your details.) Assuming the project gets off the ground we'll contact everyone at the end of the crowdfunding campaign with details of how to get hold of low income tickets. How many we can make available depends on how much is raised. Share this page with your friends and encourage them to contribute so that more low income spaces can be subsidised!</p>

<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<p>We want to make this event as enjoyable and accessible as possible for all our guests. The venue has one ground floor toilet (with shower) set aside specifically for disabled guests. The majority of the entertainment and food is based around the ground floor though there is a first floor, with some workshop and party / play space, accessible via  stair case. There is no lift but our team will be happy at all times to give assistance in accessing those spaces. Also we are happy to offer free places to helpers or carers. We have created a <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wBtt793Rmts28QSyqXGhHU_TM0pH062epYmzs_TC5Ks/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">work-in-progress document describing the accessibility of the venue</a> including photos and floorplans. Please leave a comment on this page or on our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheSummerHouseWeekend"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a> if you have any questions or if we can assist you in any way.</p>

<p><span>The downside of crowdfunding a weekend arts event is that there will always be people who have prior engagements and can't make it. We're sad to miss you! But still, in order to make this concept happen we need to everyone's support regardless of whether or not they personally can come. If you believe in this concept and you'd like to see a similar weekend occur every year, please pledge what you can even if you can't come.  Everyone who pledges as part of this crowdfunding campaign will get early access to the cheapest earlybird prices for next year's event. And do pass the link on to trusted friends who you know will appreciate the ethos. </span></p>

<p>The curator of The Summer House Weekend is Tobias Fauntleroy Slater, founder of White Mischief; helping put together the sessions and workshops are the team from <a href=""http://www.sacredpleasures.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sacred Pleasures</a>. In addition the team includes a wide range of people with experience in everything from events to roleplay and storytelling to spirituality and self-development. Everyone who is getting involved is doing so because they're passionate about the idea and want to be there themselves. The organisers won't be taking a penny from this crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>In order to create something that is sustainable and has the requisite safety / security, we will be paying professionals for their expertise, as you can see on the budget above. Some practitioners (eg massage therapists) may also charge extra during the weekend for one-on-one sessions that you can book separately. The main organisers make their income not from this crowdfunding but during the weekend, from selling drink and juices. Even still, it won't be a huge amount for what is a big project to organise. The main thing we get out of this is the pleasure of seeing it happen.</p>

</ul></div>","This campaign is complete! Here's how to get your tickets, book your transport, dining, accommodation, treatments and more!
On June 16 the crowdfunding deadline hit and we are delighted to announce that thanks to your help The Summer House Weekend is definitely on. Your pledges helped us raise 40% more than the bare bones minimum, and 70% of what we need for the whole event. If you pledged in the past 24 hours we will write to you personally with more information. 
If you have just discovered this event you may be interested in reading this page, but where you need to go for the full information is our website at TheSummerHouseWeekend.com
 
 
 

 

 

 

 
Welcome Home!
Hosted at a private country house about an hour outside London over August 16th to 18th this year, The Summer House is a marvellously magical experience like no other. It starts a bit like a retreat - workshops, sessions, talks, treatments, games, swimming - and crescendoes into a private house party featuring fabulous performances, music, dancing, storytelling and late-night conversations in front of the log fire. With plenty of opportunities to learn together, dine together and play together, The Summer House is not only a great party but also a place to make meaningful and lasting connections.
When you come to The Summer House you're more than just a guest: you're part of an extended family of friends-of-friends. You're home. We believe in inclusivity, respect and community-building - because we want everyone to feel equally free to participate and express themselves. 
 

What you can expect to find: 


 
Workshops and talks: cuddle workshop; ""Morning Glory"" dance session; yoga; storytelling; consent and communication; speed dating; flirtation; talks and debates from well-known authors; mask-making; hula-hooping classes 
Activities: Lake swimming; tennis; badminton; croquet; giant Jenga; lawn Twister; boules; treasure hunts; 
One-on-one treatments and sessions: Massage; hair and make-up styling; photo portrait parlour; face painting; facials; hair styling; more.
After dark: Cabaret/performances; music; DJs and dancing; a ceilidh; storytelling; poetry; vintage cinema; log fires and a bonfire
 

 
As you can see, this crowdfunding campaign has hit its minimum target. First of all, thanks to everyone who has pledged so far and who has helped spread the word. We're grateful for and touched by your enthusiastic support. We said from the start that the minimum target would only cover the basic infrastructure of the event (as shown on the first budget sheets below.) 
The full budget is £30,000 so we still need your pledges! In crowdfunding it's allowed to overshoot the minimum and raise more funds during the campaign, which is what we need your help in achieving so that we can secure the more fancy elements like performance.
 

For you: Pledging now enables you to get the cheapest possible prices with no booking fees. These are £65 for Saturday night, £80 for Saturday day onwards, and £90 for the whole weekend. Also, if you pledge now you get access to all the perks (see the list further down the page), which includes an invitation to a special celebratory get-together in London in July and a crowdfunders' drinks at the House on Friday 16th August. 
The prices after the crowdfunding campaign will definitely be quite a bit higher, with booking fees.
For us: Every penny that is pledged during this crowdfunding campaign will go directly into improving the event with extras like performance, music, extra workshops shown in the second budget sheet below. The more that gets pledged now, the more easily we can guarantee certain items from the second budget will be at the event. Plus, the more accurately we can predict the final numbers, which will mean a better-organised event all round.
 
 

  

  

 

  
 
 

Read the feedback from guests at our inaugural event last year:  



 
 

Every penny you pledge in this campaign goes directly into the costs of the event. Thanks to your generosity we are about two thirds of the way towards our final target. 


The bare bones of the event was achieved in phase one of the campaign - thanks to your help!

 

  

 
Food: If camping you may bring and cook your own food, but please no open fires. Alternatively you can feast with the food prepared by our team of chefs. A more conventional page will open up for booking dining once the crowdfunding campaign is complete.A hearty dinner will be served on Friday night and a delicious summer dinner of salads and soups on Saturday night (cost approximately £30 per head per night). A rustic breakfast will be served on Saturday and Sunday mornings (cost around £10 per head). There are about three dinner servings per night; guests serve themselves from the banqueting table and can eat together - outside if the weather is good, inside if not. We can cater to vegans, vegetarians and those with dietary requirements, if given notice. In addition, independent street food chefs will supply healthy meals, tea, coffee and ice cream all day every day with meals at under £10 each. Unless included in your reward, food costs extra. 
 

 
Transport: Getting to and from the House is easy. To ensure privacy and security, we do not publish the address of the House until 1-2 weeks before the party. It is approximately 35-45 minutes from London Waterloo by train on the line to Portsmouth. Or by car (close to A3/M3/M25) 40 miles / 75 minutes from central London. There is car parking at the house. Gates open 14:00 on Friday and close at 17:00 on Sunday. No arrivals after 22:00 Friday or 21:00 Saturday. If you need to book trains in advance please contact us and we will advise.
At peak times we will provide a shuttle minibus between the local station and the House (£5 charge). Also, we will charter coaches to transport guests from central London to the House on Friday lunchtime, Friday evening, Saturday morning and Saturday evening. There will be coaches back to London at 03:00 Sunday morning and 17:00 Sunday afternoon. Unless included in your pledge package, the coach will be charged separately. We can't confirm exact prices yet but they are likely to be £15 return, ie cheaper than the train.

 

 
Accommodation: Four accommodation options are available:
• Sleep in the house - all of these bedrooms are now sold out, except one wheelchair accessible single bedroom on the ground floor. 
• Glamping - sleep in a splendid 5m canvas bell tent from Blue Bell Tents, with bedding for 2, 3 or 4 people plus light and mirror, pitched ready for your arrival. Or a Shikar tent which is more like a room you can stand up in, complete with hanging rails and furniture. These will be available shortly priced £245 for two.
• Self-camping - no cost - pitch your own tent in the grounds of the house (we encourage you to decorate your camp!) No cars in camping area - campervans may set up in their own zone in the nearby parking field. We provide toilets, showers, running water at no extra cost.
• Local hotel / B&B - While we would prefer for you to stay on site, we will of course provide a list of local hotels and B&Bs to all guests who pledge.
 

 

Adults over 18 can come provided that they stick to our code of conduct, which is designed to ensure that everyone feels welcome and safe whatever their age, gender identity, sexuality, disability etc. We ask that everyone arrives and leaves accompanied by at least one friend who vouches for their behaviour and vice-versa. This is called the ""PAL system"" and is invented by KS San Francisco and licensed under Creative Commons. In short, no flying solo: simply team up with a friend or two who you know and trust and come with them.
If we don't yet know you or if you haven't been sent in our direction by an existing friend we will ask you to introduce yourself so we can get to know all our guests. Expect to meet people from a wide range of alternative communities like Burning Man, Nowhere, Decompression, Rumpus, Secret Garden Party, KSL, AP, Night of the Senses, Sacred Pleasures, Wonderland, Planet Angel, TG, White Mischief, 5 Rhythms, the world of tantra, the dressup and vintage scene and more.
 
Here's what last year's guests said: 


  

 
Tickets and perks
If you want to come to the event, a pledge of £65 will get you in on Saturday night; £80 on Saturday daytime onwards; and £90 all weekend. The Indiegogo tickets are the cheapest possible ""Earlybird"" prices, with no booking fee, and include various perks as detailed below.
After the crowdfunding campaign, expect prices to go up to something like £75 for the Saturday night and £125 for the whole weekend. Please note that your pledges are in your name, non-refundable and the perks cannot be transferred to other guests, other events or other times.
All pledges of £25 or £50 include the reward of upgrading to a ticket at the Indiegogo prices any time up to July 8. It's like a part-payment!
Some of the other perks do not come with tickets, so make sure you read the information under each perk package. if you want more than one perk, all you have to do is contribute to more than one option!
""THE BACKERS' PACK"" is a pack of perks included in all pledges of £65 and above and features: Invitation to a celebratory London get-together in July • A Summer House badge • Your name or nickname as a credit on our website • Updates on the project • Access to a secret feedback group • A pack of music downloads from artists who have performed White Mischief • A pack of photo downloads from previous White Mischief events • Wallpaper downloads featuring Summer House illustrations • A memento book PDF inspired by the weekend.
BUT you don't need to attend the Weekend to pledge! You can pledge any amount you like and you can choose the option marked ""No perk, I just want to contribute"". You can also pledge on someone else's behalf if they can't afford it themselves.
 
 

 

If you have any questions about perks or bundles please add a comment on this page or on the Facebook page. If you have an idea for a particular reward that you can't see listed, contact me and I'll try to make it happen. Particularly multiples or bundles of different perks.
 
 

By default, Indiegogo lists the names of backers who make a pledge. If you want to remain anonymous so that your pledge is not seen by others, you can choose to make an anonymous pledge or you can give a different backer name.
Only we the organisers see your real name. We won't pass on or share the details of people who pledge without their express permission. We are also happy with guests using nicknames in public spaces. But if you are attending the Weekend we will need for you to give your true identity to us in advance as our door / accreditation staff will be checking photo ID on arrival.
 

  

 

None of us on the team is wealthy, so we do sympathise! Putting on an intimate independent weekend like works out more expensive, per person, than a corporate enterprise with guests in their thousands or tens of thousands. The entry price you see in these pledge packages is as low as we can make it. There are no hidden booking fees or camping charges for you...and every penny from the pledge goes into the event costs. We feel that the value compares well to other weekends this summer.
But we understand there will always be some people who can't commit the full amount. So we offer a Saturday night only option, which is a little cheaper and allows you to enjoy the climax of things. We also offer a sort of part-payment scheme, so that anyone who pledges £25 or £50 in the crowdfunding campaign gets the power to upgrade to the earlybird price ticket by July 8.
If you're in dire financial straits, please pledge what you can now, even if it's just a pound, to help us towards the campaign target. (If you don't have a bank card please post a message here on our Facebook page so we can register your details.) Assuming the project gets off the ground we'll contact everyone at the end of the crowdfunding campaign with details of how to get hold of low income tickets. How many we can make available depends on how much is raised. Share this page with your friends and encourage them to contribute so that more low income spaces can be subsidised!
 
Accessibility
We want to make this event as enjoyable and accessible as possible for all our guests. The venue has one ground floor toilet (with shower) set aside specifically for disabled guests. The majority of the entertainment and food is based around the ground floor though there is a first floor, with some workshop and party / play space, accessible via  stair case. There is no lift but our team will be happy at all times to give assistance in accessing those spaces. Also we are happy to offer free places to helpers or carers. We have created a work-in-progress document describing the accessibility of the venue including photos and floorplans. Please leave a comment on this page or on our Facebook page if you have any questions or if we can assist you in any way.

<h2><strong>Let's start cleaning with Tbag</strong></h2>
<p>Every diver and surfer an ocean cleaner, with Tbag. Surfers and divers have access to floating trash while in the water. Our Tbag is a wearable trash bag, keep your hands free while surfing and diving, yet easily accessible. It won't bother you while surfing or diving.</p>
<p>The bag has a clever sleeve, so trash goes in easily and doesn't get washed out. It is worn on the leg or low on the hip, left or right leg, and a zipper makes it easy to empty the trash once on shore. It is made of old banners and old inner tubes for scooters. We can all help to clean, it is important to keep clean what we love.</p>
<p>The bags are 80% made of recycled materials: we use old banners and old tubes. Every bag is unique due to the banner use. The tubes are super strong, comfortable and dry quickly.</p>
<p>The bags are locally made in Bali, hand made by a craftsman where there is plenty of banners and scooters. We make sure the local Bali community gets a fair deal for their fantastic work. </p>
<p>Join us, get your bags, or support in your own way, so we can do a massive clean up movement before the end of the year!</p>

<p>Tbag offers many benefits compared to currently used handheld mesh bags in diving and surfing.</p>
<p>1. Keep your hands free! You wear your bag, once your trash is in the bag, no worries!<br/>2. Tbag is made of recycled materials. We re-use old banners and old tubes. So the bags are made of trash.<br/>3. Less drag than mesh bags. Tbag fits tightly to your body and creates much less drag than carrying a hand held mesh bag.<br/>4. Safer for coral. Chance that your bag gets stuck to coral is nihil, compared to big bulky hand held mesh bags.<br/>5. Tbag looks good on you! </p>

<p>Trieu Huynh is the inventor of Tbag, after seeing rainy season trash in Bali with trash floating in the ocean. It seems, there is no such product for surfers and divers who are near the trash. Easy to use, comfortable to wear for divers, surfers, hikers, etc.</p>
<p>We will use the funds to get you a Tbag, to organise clean ups, to promote cleaning and to make every surfer and diver an ocean cleaner.</p>

<p>You can join the movement by wearing a Tbag whenever you are enjoying nature. Either surfing, diving, hiking, climbing, even swimming. You always have an unobtrusive trash bag with you for your own trash and for trash that you find. You never know when you find trash. But you don't notice the bag when wearing it. So, always wear it when doing your outdoor activity. Every little bit helps, one piece at a time. Let's start cleaning now and create a massive clean up now!</p>

<p>We want to make sure that our Bali friend who makes the bags gets a fair deal for his work and his families work. Good payment and good working conditions are essential to our production friends. Fauzi makes the bags by hand and he is a true crafts man. This product is created in Bali also to support the local community. Many of Fauzi's friends and neighbours don't have work. Since we started producing, everybody is involved and earns a fair deal of income.</p>
<p>It is our challenge to make sure we get enough recycled resources. For now, we have plenty!</p>

It is worn on the leg or low on the hip, left or right leg, and a zipper makes it easy to empty the trash once on shore. It is made of old banners and old inner tubes for scooters. We can all help to clean, it is important to keep clean what we love.
The bags are 80% made of recycled materials: we use old banners and old tubes. Every bag is unique due to the banner use. The tubes are super strong, comfortable and dry quickly.
The bags are locally made in Bali, hand made by a craftsman where there is plenty of banners and scooters. We make sure the local Bali community gets a fair deal for their fantastic work. 
Join us, get your bags, or support in your own way, so we can do a massive clean up movement before the end of the year!
Dedeg MahaloSurf coach and owner Mahalo Bali Surf school, Bali“It is really good.”
Pete McNicSurfer, Bali“It is a great product, everybody should have one.”
Kai SchmidtCoral transplantation diver-Nusa Dua Reef Foundation, Bali“Your bag works very well!!!! I was impressed how easy it was to use. Really love the design.”
Brad MorelandEco enterpreneur and user of 4 Tbags- Canggu, Bali""My family was impressed how it was attached to the body and that it is very well made out of recycled materials. We use it for surf and dive and everything.""
 
 

Better than hand held mesh bags
Tbag offers many benefits compared to currently used handheld mesh bags in diving and surfing.
1. Keep your hands free! You wear your bag, once your trash is in the bag, no worries!2. Tbag is made of recycled materials. We re-use old banners and old tubes. So the bags are made of trash.3. Less drag than mesh bags. Tbag fits tightly to your body and creates much less drag than carrying a hand held mesh bag.4. Safer for coral. Chance that your bag gets stuck to coral is nihil, compared to big bulky hand held mesh bags.5. Tbag looks good on you! 
Scuba Sarah in the photo, is 5 foot 3 (1m62) tall, and wears a Tbag on the left leg. 
 


What we need and what you get
We need your help to scale up our production to clean as much as soon as possible. We need as many users as possible to start cleaning. It is time to do something. We can do something, all of us together.
Trieu Huynh is the inventor of Tbag, after seeing rainy season trash in Bali with trash floating in the ocean. It seems, there is no such product for surfers and divers who are near the trash. Easy to use, comfortable to wear for divers, surfers, hikers, etc.
We will use the funds to get you a Tbag, to organise clean ups, to promote cleaning and to make every surfer and diver an ocean cleaner.
We are already shipping, so you get your bags very soon and we can all start cleaning.
 
 
 
 


The Impact
You can join the movement by wearing a Tbag whenever you are enjoying nature. Either surfing, diving, hiking, climbing, even swimming. You always have an unobtrusive trash bag with you for your own trash and for trash that you find. You never know when you find trash. But you don't notice the bag when wearing it. So, always wear it when doing your outdoor activity. Every little bit helps, one piece at a time. Let's start cleaning now and create a massive clean up now!
 
 


 
 
 
 


Risks and challenges

No worries, we are already shipping! You will get your bag, guaranteed by us! And if the bag is not OK, we will take it back. 
We want to make sure that our Bali friend who makes the bags gets a fair deal for his work and his families work. Good payment and good working conditions are essential to our production friends. Fauzi makes the bags by hand and he is a true crafts man. This product is created in Bali also to support the local community. Many of Fauzi's friends and neighbours don't have work. Since we started producing, everybody is involved and earns a fair deal of income.
It is our challenge to make sure we get enough recycled resources. For now, we have plenty!
 
 



Other Ways You Can Help

I look for scenes that are graphic, quiet and which I can convey subtexts of time and identity. I started photographing the architectural landscape of the Ocean Beach cottages in 2009, focusing on the color, space and form. <br/><br/>Fascinated by both the interiors and exteriors, and feeling closely connected to Ocean Beach—I regularly vacationed there with my own family—I was deeply upset by the devastation wrought upon this wonderful place, by Superstorm Sandy in October 2012.<br/><br/>With equal measures of curiosity and sadness, I returned to Ocean Beach to photograph it after the storm.<br/><br/>The resulting project is a photo-book, which will be published by the fine art photo-book publisher, <a href=""http://www.artbooksheidelberg.de/html/en/program/detail.html?ID=716"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kehrer Verlag</a> (Germany), with a release date to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the storm. <br/><br/><h3>The 
Campaign</h3>I’m super excited at the prospect of my Ocean Beach series, being published by a highly regarded book publisher. However, in order to make this a reality, I’m required to cover a portion of the production costs.<br/><br/>Funds raised through this campaign will go towards the production cost of the book. Ocean Beach will be published with a print run of 1,000 copies. It will be a 112-page hardcover book, with 91 color photographs and two essays.    <br/><br/>Free domestic shipping is included and a flat rate of $15 for international print and book orders.  <br/><br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The publication of the Ocean Beach book will only go ahead if I raise the necessary funds. When published, I’m donating 25% of my book royalties to <a href=""http://occupysandy.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Occupy Sandy</a>, assisting in the re-build of the Jersey Shore.<br/><br/>I believe that the Ocean Beach photographs provide an intimate and unique perspective of a special place, that resonates with a broad range of people. Not only will the book provide a visual legacy of the Ocean Beach cottages, but it will be a significant achievement in my career as a fine art photographer.<br/></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><h3><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">How you can help</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

We (Muhamad Azree and Fuad Ismail, 27) managed to build our home using 4 reclaimed container units a year ago. We have aspired many people mostly youngsters and married couple that building our own home and buying our own land is not impossible! <br/><br/>Since we have been receiving many request from public to stay and experience a night here, we are running out of space to most guest. Currently, the house can accommodate 6 people at a time (2+1) X 2 and we want to add the quota by using Concrete Culvert Tubes (so called Tube @ Container House) so you we can bring another 6 people at the same time.<br/></p> <ul> <li>We are easy going and positive minded people. We want more people like minded to join and be part of this exciting journey.</li> <li>Upon your stay here, we will educate visitors by showcasing the idea of building the container house and the processes necessary.</li> <li>We even will offer few other entertainment like in-tube entertainment unit where you can play games, karaoke or watch some movies. </li>

As young lads, we want to explore more of our potential and spend more quality time with our friends and family. We (Muhamad Azree and Fuad Ismail, 27) managed to build our home using 4 reclaimed container units a year ago. We have aspired many people mostly youngsters and married couple that building our own home and buying our own land is not impossible! Since we have been receiving many request from public to stay and experience a night here, we are running out of space to most guest. Currently, the house can accommodate 6 people at a time (2+1) X 2 and we want to add the quota by using Concrete Culvert Tubes (so called Tube @ Container House) so you we can bring another 6 people at the same time.  We are easy going and positive minded people. We want more people like minded to join and be part of this exciting journey. Upon your stay here, we will educate visitors by showcasing the idea of building the container house and the processes necessary. We even will offer few other entertainment like in-tube entertainment unit where you can play games, karaoke or watch some movies. 
Backers can also ride the bicycles provided to visit nearby mangrove park and play some outdoor & traditional activities.
There will be hammock on rooftop where you can lay down and read your favorite book   How can you back us and how will we repay your generosity
 To build Tube, we will need approximately RM16000 (Malaysian Ringgit Sixteen Thousand) or around 4000 USD. We target to complete the project on 1st November 2016  The money funded will be used to buy the tubes (preferebaly minimum 6 feet in diameter and 6 feet high and will cost around RM4000) The remaining of the money will be broken into 3 major requirements1. The glass door on 1 side of each Tube, outdoor Glass Toilet, Sink, Pantry and staircase2. Interior design (bed and decoration) + 1 unit of air conditioner3. Entertainment Unit (Embedded TV, Game Console and Satellite TV)
 The money will surely not enough to cover the entire cost of building it, but we will allocate some personal fund into the project too. 

Most of the work will be done by us and DIY-ing. Backers can come and help us too. Can be a fun activity. 

Project Location & Timeline
The project will be done at the compound of Rumah Kontena, Klang. Here's the location map to the house. (MAP)
We planned to execute the project on weekly basis:



2nd Week of August to 2nd Week of September : Start Crowfunding


3rd Week of September : Buying material and start building the base for tube and base of toilet


4th Week of September: Start ordering for the concrete tube to site and ordering glass windows, doors and toilet wall (glass)


1st Week of October: Interior Decoration Purchases


2nd to 4th Week of October: Painting, Electical Wiring, Entertainment Area Fitting and Air Conditioning Unit Installation


1st November: Launching Date! BBQ with backers and Start to Accommodate  first 6 earliest Backers. 


Priority of accommodation turn will be given based on date backed (donated).


A calendar will be shared online and date can be adjusted to later date if backers not available that week in www.rumahkontena.com/tube

 As part of the objectives, this project will help many people to be able to experience a life in container house more. We want to help youngsters to begin building their own home with very minimal cost compared to buying a ready made unit by developers. If there's more container house erected and more people come we actually:  Supporting the environment by reclaiming unused containers Reducing the green house effect Relieving dilemma of housing among youngsters and newly married couple
Shortening the period of loan tenure from 35 to 10 years instead.
Supporting big life in smaller house. Enriching every aspect.    If we don't get funded accordingly  Perhaps the project won't be realized within this year or next year as well  We have loan to repay every month and we can only secure minimum saving every month Less people may stay and less likely we can educate more people

Are you prepared for the heat waves outside when air conditioning is not available? Meet InstantCool vest, a cost-effective alternative to portable AC unit that uses NASA-developed technology to cool you with ice water circulated from the reservoir via a high-efficiency battery powered pump. ---10 Seconds Instant Cooling Effect---Why Liquid Cooling Works BestNASA pioneered the use of garments employing circulating chilled liquid in the 1960's to keep astronauts cool during spacewalks. Systems of similar construction are currently in use by military personnel in aircraft and armored land vehicles. These systems are very expensive because they use compressor-based refrigeration units to chill the circulating liquid coolant. By substituting ordinary ice to chill the water, the cost and complexity of the system are greatly reduced, making the InstantCool cooling system affordable, yet still truly effective. ---One-Touch Button---Temperature Control within Comfort ZoneWorried if the temperature is appropriate for you? You can switch your vest on/off using the button to adjust the temperature according to your preference. This way, you control the temperature within your comfort zone. Test Video-Cooling Effect
From the video, we can see that it takes effect in 10 seconds. Though it takes more time for the test instrument to reflect the temperature change, we can feel the cooling almost instantly if we put the vest on.
 


We've asked some random people nearby to help us test the vest a few days earlier. Check it out what they say about our InstantCool vest :)

How heavy is the whole system?A: If fill the water bag with ice case, the tube temperature is around 53℉ (12℃), if fill the water bag with ice cube directly, the tube temperature is around 46℉ (8℃), you will feel very cool as you will wear a T-shirt underneath. The whole system with water and ice weight would be 3LB (1.4kg), the net weight of the system is 2.42LB (1.1kg).Q: If I wear this cooling jacket a whole day, will I feel very heavy and will my shoulder get sore?A: You will not feel too heavy even after an entire day because the weight is not distributed on your shoulder only. Instead, it is distributed across your body because it is a snug fit for your body.",27.0,4,"1 Campaign

<b>Why Crowdsourcing?</b>
</h2><p>The new trend has shown that Crowdsourcing brings a collective 
wisdom into any community and as a result, the community turns into a 
self-organizing system.</p><p>To manage our society's health, there is no
 better choice than inviting people's wisdom in a platform where people 
can take part in shaping their own health.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here is a quick look at how it works:</p><p><br/></p>

<p>It’s simple. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>It’s free. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>And you don’t have to do it alone! You can crowdsource it!  <br/></p>

<h2>How?</h2>
<p>Start by setting your meal plan specifications (vegetarian, gluten free,
 low carb, heart healthy, etc...), budget and ease of preparation.<br/></p>
<p>Then, invite family friends or anyone you like to join in the process. Make your very own meal planning team, on the fly!<br/>

<h1>Our Vision <br/>
</h1>
<p>At MealPlanBook, we believe that every
person needs to be informed about the food they eat so that they can be empowered to make healthy changes to their meals. <br/></p>
<p>About 20 years ago,  the Nutrition Facts label was introduced  to help consumers make
 informed food choices and maintain healthy dietary practices. More recently, last month, the United States Food and Drug Administration released nutritional labeling rules for food service establishments (franchisors with more than 20 locations). While, government has initiated a great movement toward increasing food awareness, it is up to us to take responsibility for our homemade meals. Homemade
recipes have not been standardized and monitored for their nutritional value, food group balance and portion control. <br/></p>
<h2 style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.15px; font-size: 20px;"">With the help of MealPlanBook nutritional analysis tools and the power of social support that comes through crowdsource meal planning, we can hold ourselves accountable and do the same for
our homemade meals. </h2>
<div style=""background-color: #ededed; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 25px; padding-right: 8px; padding-top: 15px;"">
<h2 style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.20px; font-size: 28px; color: #EB1478;"">""If you feel the urgency to act, then support us."" MealPlanBook is a <i>patent pending</i> tool that we want to make available for
free to everyone. Join us in this venture and help to make it happen.</h2>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>There are features in the application that require further development. The funds we receive from this campaign will go directly to
the completion of the prototype and vigorous testing, to ensure steady and reliable results.  Furthermore, we will work with nutritionists to revise and approve  homemade recipes in accordance to the recommendations.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Goals</h1>
<h4>Our three financial goals are:</h4>
<p><span>1.<span> 
</span></span>At $100,000, we will deliver the
first version of the web application, free to users EVERYWHERE!</p>
<p><span>2.<span>  </span></span>For the next $50,000, we will
standardize 1,000 recipes complete with portion size and nutritional facts so
that everyone can see and use the recipes for free. Furthermore, our development team will keep developing more features. <br/></p>
<p><span>3.<span>  </span></span>For the next $100,000, we will
complete additional of 2,000 standardized recipes, complete with portion size and nutritional
facts for everyone. We also will release a mobile app, which will be synced among different devices.<br/></p>

<p>Lastly, we cannot stress enough the
importance of bringing this effective nutritional information to the masses. <br/>
We are incredibly appreciative of any
contribution you can make. Check out some rewards you can earn with your contribution on the right side of the screen.</p>

<h1>Risks and Challenges</h1>
<p> We have spent more than a year to investigate every aspect of this application and developed a prototype.
The prototype for MealPlanBook is functional, however we still have work to develop all the features that we want. As many of you know, sometimes development becomes tricky and takes more time than expected. The good news is that we have earned a lot of experience in this area and when necessary, we will look for additional help to resolve any emerging problem. </p>

<p></p></div>","What is MealPlanBook?

MealPlanBook is the world's first crowdsourced meal planning 
application. Anyone can create meal plans in collaboration with family and 
friends; monitor nutritional analysis of every meal instantly and 
receive a shopping list of the ingredients. 
MealPlanBook, also serves as a marketplace for home cooks, chefs and 
healthcare professionals to connect with each other. Anyone can request 
an expert advice or purchase a healthy meal plan based on their needs 
from their favorite chefs, nutritionists or healthcare professionals.The different features and tools of MealPlanBook keep you in check and help you make healthy meal choices.


Why Crowdsourcing?
The new trend has shown that Crowdsourcing brings a collective 
wisdom into any community and as a result, the community turns into a 
self-organizing system.To manage our society's health, there is no
 better choice than inviting people's wisdom in a platform where people 
can take part in shaping their own health.

Here is a quick look at how it works:


It’s simple. 
It’s free. 
And you don’t have to do it alone! You can crowdsource it!  

How?
Start by setting your meal plan specifications (vegetarian, gluten free,
 low carb, heart healthy, etc...), budget and ease of preparation.
Then, invite family friends or anyone you like to join in the process. Make your very own meal planning team, on the fly!





Features:



MealPlanBook’s unique software provides you with real time feedback on nutritional value and portion size of each meal, based on the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans and The Healthy Eating Plate by Harvard School of Public Health.





Enter an existing recipe you have used for
years, or create a new one and see where  it stands compared to the recommendations. Make the necessary adjustments to your meal so that you can  trust your food. 


MealPlanBook’s creative feature Plagraph (a combination of a plate and a graph) allows the user to view the food they have entered in their recipe graphed on a plate, in conjunction with a portion size scale. You can instantly measure the calories and nutritional value of your meal. 



Why consuming a balanced food (from major food groups) is important? 

Some common disorders are the result of imbalanced nutrition and improper food pairing. For instance, did you know that iron deficiency anemia is the most common nutritional deficiency and the leading cause of anemia in the United States? ( Ref: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
 Or ""did you know that about 1 of 7 older people who live in the community and about half of older people in long-term care facilities have undernutrition?"" ( Ref: Merck Manuals/ Disorders of Nutrition)



Easily schedule your recipes...





Get and stay organized! Access your weekly shopping list in the cloud!   






By crowdsourcing your meal plan, you can turn the daunting task of meal planning into a fun social event and share it with the rest of the world. If you are in the spirit of doing good, create a meal planning team for a local charity and cook for a cause or your local school.


Engage your family, friends, a chef or your healthcare professional to collaborate with you. Invite them to your meal planning team.





If cooking is your passion or your career, you can publish your meal plans for your clients, publicly or privately!


Our Vision 

At MealPlanBook, we believe that every
person needs to be informed about the food they eat so that they can be empowered to make healthy changes to their meals. 
About 20 years ago,  the Nutrition Facts label was introduced  to help consumers make
 informed food choices and maintain healthy dietary practices. More recently, last month, the United States Food and Drug Administration released nutritional labeling rules for food service establishments (franchisors with more than 20 locations). While, government has initiated a great movement toward increasing food awareness, it is up to us to take responsibility for our homemade meals. Homemade
recipes have not been standardized and monitored for their nutritional value, food group balance and portion control. 
With the help of MealPlanBook nutritional analysis tools and the power of social support that comes through crowdsource meal planning, we can hold ourselves accountable and do the same for
our homemade meals. 

""If you feel the urgency to act, then support us."" MealPlanBook is a patent pending tool that we want to make available for
free to everyone. Join us in this venture and help to make it happen.


There are features in the application that require further development. The funds we receive from this campaign will go directly to
the completion of the prototype and vigorous testing, to ensure steady and reliable results.  Furthermore, we will work with nutritionists to revise and approve  homemade recipes in accordance to the recommendations.

Goals
Our three financial goals are:
1. 
At $100,000, we will deliver the
first version of the web application, free to users EVERYWHERE!
2.  For the next $50,000, we will
standardize 1,000 recipes complete with portion size and nutritional facts so
that everyone can see and use the recipes for free. Furthermore, our development team will keep developing more features. 
3.  For the next $100,000, we will
complete additional of 2,000 standardized recipes, complete with portion size and nutritional
facts for everyone. We also will release a mobile app, which will be synced among different devices.

Lastly, we cannot stress enough the
importance of bringing this effective nutritional information to the masses. 
We are incredibly appreciative of any
contribution you can make. Check out some rewards you can earn with your contribution on the right side of the screen.


Risks and Challenges
 We have spent more than a year to investigate every aspect of this application and developed a prototype.
The prototype for MealPlanBook is functional, however we still have work to develop all the features that we want. As many of you know, sometimes development becomes tricky and takes more time than expected. The good news is that we have earned a lot of experience in this area and when necessary, we will look for additional help to resolve any emerging problem. 

Other Ways You Can Help!
Every little amount makes a difference. And for
every dollar, we ask you to voice your support as well. If you like MealPlanBook help to move it forward and
get the word out.  These are some other ways that comes to our mind:


Contacting local
reporters or media outlets about MealPlanBook.






Sharing and liking MealPlanBook fanpage with others. 






Following or tweeting MealPlanBook on Twitter. 






Writing a commentary blog about benefits of MealPlanBook.





User stories:

MealPlanBook can help a wide range of users. If you wonder MealPlanBook can help you or not, watch the following user stories.

Check Grandpa and Grandma to see where they need help:

With MealPlanBook, Grandpa Stuart can bring his
recipes to life and create healthy and affordable meals for his wife, children
and grandchildren.

Here is Mary's problem: 

For a registered nutritionist like Mary,
checking her client’s meal plans via MealPlanBook is the perfect way to
immediately serve her clients. As an added bonus, MealPlanBook offers users the
option to sell their recipes and services online- a great way for Mary to get
paid right away.

Watch James' story, a popular chef, and see why he can't make money from selling his fabulous meal plans?

Professional chefs can create their famous recipes with cooking 
instructions and pictures of each step on MealPlanBook and receive 
payment for their creations. Like James, a working chef and online 
entrepreneur who creates recipes and daily meals to share with his 
entire online social network, and earn cash if his followers decide to 
subscribe to his meal plans.

What is bothering Adam? Single dad who loves his
little daughter, Sofia.

For Adam, who loves teaching his
daughter how to cook and plan nutritional meals, MealPlanBook is a great platform where he can invite his friend and family, especially Sofia to create a healthy meal plan. 

Nancy is a mother of three children and her family needs are completely different:

For Nancy, MealPlanBook is ideal because she can instantly adjust her recipes to care for her family's need, especially for her little son who require special diet. Once she creates her meal plan, she can send it to her doctor for her recommendations.

<p>It seems outrageous to us that such an iconic hand tool in our country's history is no longer actually hand produced in our country.</p>
<p>There used to be more than 200 axe makers in Maine alone; today there are none.</p>
<p>So a year and a half ago, we started a company to change that. We began by restoring and selling vintage axes found at tool barns, swap meets and garage sales.</p>
<p>Along the way we had the pleasure of fixing up other people's old axes - and learning the stories behind them. Like the guy in San Francisco who found an axe in the wall of a home he was restoring or the gold prospector who found one washed up along a river in Idaho.</p>
<p>We've educated ourselves on the history and craft of axe-making and, with the help of local blacksmiths and machinists, are ready to forge our own axe using time-tested techniques and the highest quality American-made materials.</p>
<p>Beginning this summer, we are bringing back the Maine wedge pattern to make a versatile 2-pound camp axe we are calling the Allagash Cruiser.</p>

<p>Like our Nazca, we designed the Allpa with a slotted back panel to house the shoulder straps and hip belt, ensuring loose ends are a nonissue at the baggage claim, on the bus, or in the trunk of taxis.

<p>At its core, the Allpa Travel Pack is the result of years spent traveling, testing, and refining our proven-in-the-wild Cotopaxi designs. We took this real-world feedback and funneled it into a backpack format, knowing that the Allpa would be directed to those of us who prefer the support and comfort provided by backpacking packs’ harness systems. Having contoured shoulder straps, a proper hip belt, sternum strap, and fully padded airmesh back panel as its foundation serves several key purposes. First, it eliminates the bulky roller wheels, hard bottoms, and telescoping handles plaguing many “travel bags,” and second, it ensures your gear remains supported via the system we adopted from our load-toting backpacking packs. Additionally, if your pack is physically strapped to your body, security is heightened while moving through crowded areas compared to hand-held duffels and roller bags.</p>

</div></div>","ADVENTURE TRAVEL NEEDED A BETTER PACKA system that could take us way off the grid and deep into new cities. Something more comfortable and nimble, and loaded with tested features. In other words, a pack that goes where other “travel packs” only dream of.So, we made it.Introducing the Allpa 35L: a rugged, 35-liter backpack system built for adventure travel. This pack is perfectly sized for carry-on convenience, loaded with well-designed features, and tough enough to handle years of hard use. The foundation of the Allpa is its unique, load-supporting suspension we adopted from our backpacking packs. This provides the comfort and support necessary for nimble travel, in addition to increasing security in high-traffic areas. Hand-held duffels and roller bags just can’t compete. The Allpa features a sleek, 35L shape that stows into overhead bins, trunks, and buses with ease. The material is a tough TPU-coated 1000D polyester, with durable 1680D ballistic nylon paneling. We designed the pack without outer pockets, exposed buckles, pockets, and straps for good reason, knowing that these features often snag and get in the way while on the move. With the pack splayed open, you’ll see that the left and right sides offer ample room for the bulkof your gear. We added one large zippered mesh compartment on the right for clothing and soft, moldable items, and then subdivided the left side with two small zippered pockets along the top and a central zippered mesh divider below to access the cavernous compartment underneath.  In terms of security, all external zippers feature our theft-proof webbing sewn across the openings. There’s also a sewn-in carabiner loop on the hip belt’s webbing to lock the pack to bus rails or a fixed point. 
Like our Nazca, we designed the Allpa with a slotted back panel to house the shoulder straps and hip belt, ensuring loose ends are a nonissue at the baggage claim, on the bus, or in the trunk of taxis. Top, side, and bottom grab handles provide multiple carry points while the shoulder straps are tucked away.
 
Once you’ve arrived at your destination, there’s even a stowable daypack that deploys for fast- and-light daytrips, hikes, and other excursions that demand a smaller, lighter pack. So, why’s it so colorful? Each Batac is part of our Del Día collection, meaning that it’s made from sections of remnant fabric.Pair the Allpa with our new stowable Batac Daypack.

When I wad asked to test out the Lunar glass rods by Moonlit I was eager to see what this glass rod could do. This rod surprised me from the moment I laid my hands on it.  Not only a beauty to look at, but it recovers quickly, is super forgiving, and is extremely accurate. This rod handle anything and anyone I put on it.  In my role as a fly fishing guide I get lots of brand new or fairly new fly fisherman and woman who want to learn more about the sport.  I have no problem putting one of these rods in their hands.  The load of the rod as it casts is easy to feel and I watched as it changed beginning anglers into intermediate with abilities to hit some casts even advanced anglers have trouble making.  I watched anglers who were struggling to make 25 foot casts with their expensive graphite rod, make 75+ foot casts with the 3wt Lunar during practice sessions.  The change was that they could feel the rhythm of the cast with the Lunar.  With the range of glass rods available from 2wt to 8wt, the rod is capable of handing anything you want to throw with it to. From delicate dry fly presentations to hefty, meaty streamers it can handle them all.  I can’t wait for these rods to hit the market because I know I’ll have a couple in my bag of tricks.""</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561775356/jdf2h2f8bnmledi4b5ti.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/insectinside"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Paul Shurtleff</a> </strong><br/>""The old days of heavy, flimsy fiberglass fly rods are a thing of the past with a warm welcome of the new Lunar Glass fly rods by Moonlit Fly Fishing.

The deep flex of these rods allow us to slow down, letting the rod do most of the work for us so we can enjoy the nature around us and the rhythm of the rod.  We also love the smooth casting action and light  delicate presentation that a great glass rod gives us.   Just like with our furled leaders we love the history and tradition that fiberglass has, AND just like our Moonlit leaders we have found new material blends and fine tuned tapers that take these old traditional products to a modern upgraded hi-performance products.  Why Our Glass Rods?An Old Glass Feel with a Modern TwistOur NEW Lunar Series of S-Glass rods have been designed to have an old glass feel but lighter weight with a bit faster action, we have been able to do this with today's new age advanced fiberglass materials and the expertise of our rod designer.Fast Recovering TipOne thing we don't like in many glass rods is an overly soft tip that robs your casting energy, and give you arm fatigue. We designed the Lunar rods to have a fast recovering tip that eliminates over oscillation so the rod's casting energy goes straight into your line without the wobble.Progressive Taper with Reserved PowerThe progressive action allows you to make smooth accurate short to medium casts but it also has a lot of reserved power to bomb the line out there when needed.

 
 Excellent Roll CastsThe Lunar rods with their deep rod flex are also excellent at performing accurate roll casts.Great Hook SetsThe Lunar S-Glass rods are also stiff enough to give you a great hook set and has enough backbone to fight fish effectively but elastic enough to bend all the way into the handle if needed.Compact 4 Piece RodsAll the Lunar rods are a 4 piece which compacts down great for traveling and backpacking.Several Sizes to Choose FromThe Lunar rods will come in sizes 2wt, 3wt, 4wt, 5wt, 6wt, 7wt, and 8wt giving you many options to fit your wants and needs. Each size will be a different color:
8wt - 8ft 6in light blue
7wt - 8ft 6in maroon
6wt- 8ft 2in orange
5wt - 8ft blue
4wt - 7ft 6in red
3wt - 6ft 8in light brown
2wt - 6ft 6in green
Bold But ClassyThese rods are bold colors like the glass rods people have loved with a nicely done white accent near the handle. The finish and classy wraps are about as good as it gets from a factory produced rod, we paid attention to the details. This is not just a rod that will love to use but a rod that well stand out visually.

 
 Lifetime WarrantyOne thing we do differently in the glass world is offer an easy lifetime warranty. Instead of making you ship your rod into us for repairs, for a $45 warranty fee we send the replacement parts right to you, so you are back to fishing faster.Back By a Great Brand, MOONLIT Fly FishingYou have probably seen our brand around social media quite a bit, we have a large following of customers that love to use our products. We are well know for the BEST performing furled leaders on the market and excellent customer service, as well as a great offering of quality barbless hooks loved by many pro fly tyers. We will stand behind this new series of fiberglass fly rods just like we do all of our products and we think you will love this rod series.Heavily Tested & Approved by Many Fly AnglersOur prototype rods have been heavily tested by our great ambassadors in all kinds of water and all kinds of fish. The Lunar rods have also traveled abroad several times to Belize, Alaska and more. They have been tested by people who have lots of experience fishing fiberglass and also those who, up till now, mostly fished graphite rods. All the feedback has praised these rods for their performance and enjoyment in all the experiences and situations. We have also taken them to many fly fishing expos and let potential customers and fly fishing experts test them out and received excellent feedback about how they cast and look. Some Reviews:Travis Jones""I’ve been fly fishing now for more than 30 years, and guiding for over 10.  During that time I’ve owned rods that ranged anywhere from a couple hundred dollars all the way up to the thousand dollar rigs. When I wad asked to test out the Lunar glass rods by Moonlit I was eager to see what this glass rod could do. This rod surprised me from the moment I laid my hands on it.  Not only a beauty to look at, but it recovers quickly, is super forgiving, and is extremely accurate.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Imagine a mommy friend taking you by the hand and walking you around Paris, Chicago or Tokyo. She would know all the hidden spots for kids. Restaurants, playgrounds and stores only locals know.</p>

<p>This is about making your life easier and your children’s lives richer.</p>

<h3>Our Vision For The Bébé Voyage Trails App:</h3>
<p>The number one question Bebe Voyage users ask each other is – what can I do with my little one when I get to my destination?</p>
<p>What gets us excited is to see the number of replies, 50, 100, sometimes more. Our community is extremely active, with 10,000 of the 13,000 Bébé Voyage users in the Club posting or commenting often, sharing itineraries, tips and ideas based on their respective experiences.</p>
<p>But this information gets lost in the social media fray. So we thought – how can we best capture this valuable information – and the huge amount of it – in a way that is useful to our users? How can we best organize what is already being shared in a way that is searchable for our users?</p>
<p>Can we, in the end, build a platform where like-minded parents can connect with each other in a more meaningful way?</p>
<p>This will be an extremely powerful platform that will change the way parents explore the world with their children. And we need you to make it happen!</p>
<p>In October, we launched 18 family-friendly trails in partnership with Crumbdrop, a technology platform that generates instant animated slideshows of destinations and neighborhoods with interactive maps that you can save and share.</p>
<p>Using the money we raised last year, we were able to build <a href=""https://www.bebevoyage.com/trails/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">18 pilot trails</a> to test the concept. The feedback has been amazing with many members eager to build their own trails.  In addition, we have seen a huge increase in website traffic over the last few months.</p>
<p>We now want to continue our partnership with Crumbdrop to customize their technology for Bébé Voyage’s needs. We want to make it possible for all traveling families to create and share their adventures on the go.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Imagine a mommy friend taking you by the hand and walking you around Paris, Chicago or Tokyo. She would know all the hidden spots for kids. Restaurants, playgrounds and stores only locals know.
Welcome To The Bébé Voyage App.
Over the last few years, we have created a community of parents around the world who exchange tips on hotels, packing needs, flight toys, destinations, sites, restaurants, adventures and so much more. We are ready to take this community to the next level.
We want to empower children to be curious, open-minded, global citizens. We want them to become lifelong travelers. And we want them, in turn, to build a better, more peaceful world.
This is about making your life easier and your children’s lives richer.

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $10,000 in one week to support the creation of the app in collaboration with Crumbdrop and their developers.
Our vision is to create an inclusive, dynamic community that everyone can benefit from. Can you help? As a thank you, you will get early access to the app and amazing thank you gifts from companies that share the same values as Bébé Voyage.
With such an engaged community, we are hoping to get 100% participation from our members!
Check out our various donation levels which include thank you gifts from some of Club Bébé Voyage's favorite brands.
Bébé Voyage only partners with brands that we know and trust.

Instead of a suitcase-sized box, what about a handbag size? Could we get it under 20 pounds? How many steps could we cut out of the assembly process?</p><p>And of course, it had to be a blast in the water- solid, stable and lively. Oh, and it had to be sleek and beautiful- we think a 10 foot kayak should still have sweet lines and curves.</p><p><strong>To do all of this, we had to go back to the basics of origami- and develop a SHINY. NEW. FOLD PATTERN.</strong> Every crease was designed from scratch, through dozens of paper and cardboard models. Every fold had to be designed to nest and fit perfectly, to eliminate wasted space and make the smallest box possible.</p><p>When we started the project, we had no idea if all of this was possible. But we kept pushing to make something AMAZING.  We hope it’ll kindle your sense of adventure, get you to your happy place, and just plain knock your socks off. </p><div data-id=""26091367""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1570669410/iitcdrvgbu6sxxaxci07.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/8165/files/f6dd22b65f1fdc80e17c83d5026d203b_original.gif?67433"" src=""""/></p><h1><strong>Time to Recreate</strong></h1><p>The Inlet makes the water accessible, simple and easy – for everyone.

We think “accessible” should mean “affordable”. We’ve spent the last two years overhauling our production process and have gone as far as building our own facility in Mexico and have become vertically integrated in order to fully control processes and our end product. And as we’ve worked on the Inlet, we’ve been maniacal about reducing the costs of new parts through clever design and sourcing.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean we’re cheap! We are still committed to using the highest quality materials and giving you an outstanding experience- we’ll never skimp on that. Our goal is to give a great value for a great product- especially here on Indiegogo, where you’ve supported us from the beginning. Our estimated MSRP will be $899. <strong>We're excited to launch the Inlet with extra sweet discounts and gear packages for our backers. </strong></p><h1><strong>The New Pack:</strong></h1><p>Because this new model packs up so much smaller than our other kayaks, we redesigned our pack to fit and added some sleek new features. Zip your Inlet into the new pack, clip the padded waist belt, and let your hips carry the easy 20lbs. Free up your hands and hike your boat up narrow rugged trails, down steep steps, or just through the airport with ease. Our estimated MSRP will be $179.</p><div data-id=""26081682""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1570669424/hdmmepqxp4354jhjfpkx.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><div data-id=""26090600""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1570669424/v0bterdafrbplagh33pm.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><div data-id=""26081687""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1570669425/m1woumzvu5vmdioatphy.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><div data-id=""26031940""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1570669426/qaoadu37fkjrmkcmtsg9.png"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><div data-id=""26069768""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0182/8165/files/b39c667002cd1c04d8006a882f596421_original.gif?67440"" src=""""/></div><h1>Accessorize, Accessorize</h1><p>In addition to this new pack, we also have an entire <a href=""https://www.orukayak.com/collections/accessories#gear"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">collection of kayaking accessories</a> available on our website that should meet almost all of your paddling needs!

We're Oru Kayak. A few years back, we invented the origami kayak – a craft with the strength and performance of a hardshell boat, the portability of a suitcase, and a mind-blowingly cool way to transform between the two.We believe in a world with more spontaneous adventure-  the freedom to get outside and hit the water anytime, anyplace. Now, we're taking this to a whole new level with our most revolutionary kayak yet - the Inlet. 
  We’ve done plenty of innovating over the years- we’ve introduced four models for different paddlers and types of water. Now we’re putting all that practice to work- to make the most accessible kayak in the world. To do this, we had to start from the bottom. Let’s walk you through it.   New Origami Fold PatternWe wanted to push all of Oru’s key attributes- portability, weight, foldability- to the absolute max. Instead of a suitcase-sized box, what about a handbag size? Could we get it under 20 pounds? How many steps could we cut out of the assembly process?And of course, it had to be a blast in the water- solid, stable and lively. Oh, and it had to be sleek and beautiful- we think a 10 foot kayak should still have sweet lines and curves.To do all of this, we had to go back to the basics of origami- and develop a SHINY. NEW. FOLD PATTERN. Every crease was designed from scratch, through dozens of paper and cardboard models. Every fold had to be designed to nest and fit perfectly, to eliminate wasted space and make the smallest box possible.When we started the project, we had no idea if all of this was possible. But we kept pushing to make something AMAZING.  We hope it’ll kindle your sense of adventure, get you to your happy place, and just plain knock your socks off. Time to RecreateThe Inlet makes the water accessible, simple and easy – for everyone. It's designed for flat water, with features to fit paddlers of all ages and experience levels.  As of now, we'd recommend max weight capacity topping out around 275lbs and max paddler height around 6'2"", depending on individual proportions.*Some of these features are being fine-tuned and may change slightly from the final product.Store it, Transport itOK, this part is extra exciting. The Inlet folds down into a box WAY smaller than our existing kayaks. For those new to Oru, this full-sized, hardshell kayak will fold down and carry like a small suitcase.  In box form, the Inlet is 42"" long x 19"" tall x 10"" wide.  Throw a few in the trunk of your car, check one on a plane with nary a glance from the airlines, tuck it under your couch – the world is your tetris!  No matter where you live, how much space you do or don’t have, the Inlet fits. To make our point, we’ve done some stash-testing for you. Note: no roof rack pictured. 



And if you’re the backcountry type, our super-comfy custom pack lets you trek to remote water that’s never floated a boat. How cool is that?Light as a feather, stiff as a boardLess material + fewer loose parts + streamlined fold pattern = LESS WEIGHT.This kayak only weighs 20lbs. That’s light enough for paddlers of all ages and muscle sizes to carry, pass, heck – toss this kayak as they please.
 AssemblyThe IKEA-challenged of you may ask: OK, how hard is it really to assemble?  The Inlet has just a few loose components to put in place and only 3 assembly steps. At most, you’ll need 5 minutes to put this kayak together. No sweat, no hex wrenches.3-Step Assembly:  Under 5 minutes from start to finishCheck out the real-time assembly below. 
Note: be patient with yourself and your Inlet on your first few assemblies. The folds will become more flexible over time!  PriceWe know it matters to you, and it matters to us. We think “accessible” should mean “affordable”. We’ve spent the last two years overhauling our production process and have gone as far as building our own facility in Mexico and have become vertically integrated in order to fully control processes and our end product. And as we’ve worked on the Inlet, we’ve been maniacal about reducing the costs of new parts through clever design and sourcing.But that doesn’t mean we’re cheap! We are still committed to using the highest quality materials and giving you an outstanding experience- we’ll never skimp on that. Our goal is to give a great value for a great product- especially here on Indiegogo, where you’ve supported us from the beginning. Our estimated MSRP will be $899. We're excited to launch the Inlet with extra sweet discounts and gear packages for our backers. The New Pack:Because this new model packs up so much smaller than our other kayaks, we redesigned our pack to fit and added some sleek new features. Zip your Inlet into the new pack, clip the padded waist belt, and let your hips carry the easy 20lbs. Free up your hands and hike your boat up narrow rugged trails, down steep steps, or just through the airport with ease. Our estimated MSRP will be $179.Accessorize, AccessorizeIn addition to this new pack, we also have an entire collection of kayaking accessories available on our website that should meet almost all of your paddling needs! One item that you'll absolutely need is a paddle, so we've packaged our Oru's four-piece paddle with the Inlet in a couple of our rewards packages. Like our kayaks (and unlike many other paddles), it breaks down small enough to fit almost anywhere.Oru Paddle  FEATURES:

Nice to meet you! We’ve been around for 7 years and have shipped 15,000+ boats. They’ve been paddled everywhere from the Arctic to the Caribbean, but we’re still finding new fans all over the world- glad you found us! In case the concept of an origami kayak is a little confusing...read on! We’ll go over some Oru basics. MaterialAll of our kayaks are made from a custom extruded, UV-treated plastic called OruPlast™. The material is a thicker custom-made version of the same plastic that postal service bins are made out of – and those things take a beating. All of our kayaks are rated to 20,000 folds, and while we recommend treating your Oru like a fiberglass boat, these boats are made to withstand any flatwater adventure. A new categoryOur kayaks are hard to categorize, but we're okay with that – we don't like labels. We're not an inflatable, a rigid kayak, a skin-on-frame – we're origami! Oru Kayaks combine the best features of all of these categories to make a boat that's portable and durable without sacrificing performance (*cough* inflatables). It's all thanks to origami and our technology.  Kayak comparisonNot sure what kind of kayak you need? Check out where the Inlet falls on our lineup, and head to the comparison chart on our website to compare all of the specs side-by-side.

How? There will be 4-5 ""Healthy Living"" campaigns throughout the year that a user can register for. The campaign will last under a month and in that time the user will try to complete assigned achievements for points (ie. 25 pts to hike 1 km). At the end of the campaign the user will be either awarded a prize or have the ability to put their points toward discounts at local businesses.    800 km of TrailsThe app is being developed in the city of Thunder Bay and already has 800 km of trails from the US Minnesota border to the township of Nipigon. In the coming months, the app will be expanded to the rest of Northwestern Ontario.        Offline Map AccessSafety is one of the app's main focuses, for that reason you will be able to use the app out of service or offline. The app will download map sections you are interested in hiking to your phones storage, then utilize its internal GPS.    Important Alerts and Notifications We want to make sure the user is as informed as possible, in order to do this we will be alerting you with banner or push notifications when there are important things you need to know. For example, if you are near something dangerous like a cliff we want you to know to be safe and careful. Also, private property is always an issue when hiking so we will have property boundaries marked. For a lot of our regulated areas there are rules (no off leash dogs or bikes) and trail etiquette you should know.   User ProfilesYou will have the option to create a user profile that will allow you to track your progress by recording how many kilometres you've hiked and how much time you have spent on trails... even record and save hikes! This feature also focuses on connecting you with your friends or other hikers through sharing hikes or inviting others to join you on your adventures.  This mobile application will be the ultimate tool for both residents and visitors of Northwestern Ontario. We want everyone to be able to experience all the amazing outdoor recreation our area has to offer. No more wondering where you should hike, WAYfinder Trails & Recreation can guide you safely. TimelineThe first phase of the WAYfinder Trails and Recreation mobile hiking application is currently being developed by a local media company in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Phase one will include building the apps ""backbone"" which is called the creator platform. This will allow us to manually input our data and update the information when needed. Most, but not all, of the above features will be included in the first phase development that will be available to the public in June 2018. Phase two will be our first update that will be completed 3-4 weeks following the first phase.It is understood that the majority of coding for the project development is in Phase I. The remaining phases will allow for edits and interaction, personalization and community engagement. After Phase I, WAYfinder will enter trail data and begin troubleshooting Our GoalThe goal of this Indiegogo campaign is to reach $10,000 in 30 days from the community we love. The team is confident in the need for this product and truly believe many people will benefit from it. This money will go directly towards the physical development of the mobile application. WAYfinder is working with Shout Media, who has the professional skillset and staff to deliver the best product possible. If they do not make the full goal of $10,000 every dollar will still go directly to the app.

<p>Hello everyone! We would like to introduce You to our Fantasy Village. Hope You like it!</p>
<p>This movie above is one of our promos for our games. </p>
<h3>How Fantasy Village started?</h3>
<p>As kids, our gang used to escape to our base located in a nearby forest. There was a shack and earth lodge joined together by an underground tunnel and a pine tree with a seat for the guard. We surrounded the whole base with a fence of thorny bushes with a secret entrance. Everything was built by two boys and one girl, and we share only fond memories of the times we spent there.</p>
<p>Today, as adults, we still want to have as many fond memories as possible, so we invite you to a small village by the forest which we have funded and built with our father and a group of friends. It’s bigger than the first base, because we have grown, and continue building the base with a group of wonderful young people.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Wioska Fantasy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img802.imageshack.us/img802/3092/54640833.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""this is how Wioska Fantasy looks like""/></p>
<h3>Past and future</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Even though the realisation of the living Fantasy Village idea seems distant, we have marked our goal and set the path and will certainly not go back. We have been following that path for the last two years, and with your help, we will be able to run along it to realise our and Your dreams. At the moment, the idea of a living village connects people of particular passions and talents. There are blacksmiths, craftsmen, fencing specialists, builders and writers among us. The founders watched with joy as the village grew – as the fort and first huts were surrounded by a palisade, and as a pond, bridge and a tavern appeared. We look forward to the nearest future when we will have six more huts, cultivable fields, fruit trees and pens for farm animals.</p>
<p>The living Village idea is about people living permanently in the huts, wearing costumes, keeping the Village’s atmosphere alive. They could work for the Village during the day, as tavern keepers, guards, farm workers, blacksmiths, or crafting items that could be sold. Evenings would be devoted to rest and integration at the tavern’s hearth. This would be the place where everyone could rest from the city noise and everyday problems, chill out and have a wonderful time with a group of friendly people.  </p>
<p><img alt=""Wioska Fantasy"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img833.imageshack.us/img833/741/40721557.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<h3> Things got serious</h3>
<p>We decided to post information about our Village online and the reaction exceeded our expectations. Within a week of the promotion start, a national information service published a reportage about our village, so the news about our project reached four million people. Dozens of people from all over Poland want to come to us and help with the building. The only thing we lack is money to buy materials and manage the project.</p>
<p>Fantasy Village will not be just one location, but a whole set of buildings, some a bit farther away but still retaining the fantasy atmosphere. There will be a port on the river San, a guard tower on a distant hill, elven ruins in the surrounding woods, a knights’ court, a tree top village and a rope park in one, and a system of trenches surrounding the village, that could be dwarven tunnels at the same time.</p>
<p>The village will become a theme park open to tourists, where the Village inhabitants would be providing services, working for the mutual gain. The tourists will be able to eat a meal, prove themselves in knights’ combat, or buy beautiful handcrafted items. We are aware, that we need a way to sustain our dream, so we created a business plan. Our income will come from selling handcrafted items and props, film productions, fantasy related exhibitions and shows, company events and parties such as weddings, birthdays etc.  </p>

<h3><span>Why are we asking for money?</span></h3>
<p>We decided to use crowdfunding for a number of reasons. The most prosaic one is that our current funds don’t allow us to develop the project as much as we would like to. We always need more resources, wood or time.</p>
<p>Another reason is our strong belief in the power of crowdfunding. It has helped to appreciate people with ideas and creative passions many times. That is why we want to show our Village to the world with the question – are we those people?</p>
<p>We noticed that the Fantasy Village is an inspiration for many people, especially those who feel overwhelmed by city life. We show them that the passion for hard work is enough to surround oneself with an amazing environment. Indiegogo gives us the opportunity to show our project to the world and we really hope you will like it. We want to spread the inspiration and hope that similar Villages will appear in other countries.  </p>
<p>The funds we receive will be reasonably managed and invested for the benefit of the village’s best development. We want to make sure that our product will be self-sufficient. All of the locations we are preparing will be included in the tourist product. We will constantly promote the village in Poland and the world with the help of two videoblogs, presenting the life of the villagers and the problems that medieval people faced. We will organise educational non-profit projects, especially for children, to teach them about literature and the medieval times. Those classes will be posted online both in Polish and English.  </p>
<p><span>By creating this campaign, we want to inspire as much as reaching our goal. If everyone who support our Village would give us a dollar, we would have a successful action. We understand that not everyone have finances to spare. If you are one of those persons you can stil help us. Please, contact us and help us other way or just share the word with your friends - we will be truly grateful!</span></p>

<h3>What will You recieve?</h3>
<p>There will be a huge book bound in leather with iron fittings in the Lord’s Room, the very heart of our Fort. It contains hand written sentences, both wise and merry, songs and stories of people from all over the world. The book of Founders will always remain in its honorary place, as a symbol of memory of all those who helped us with the building of our living village. In this book, each sponsor will receive a place, it’s size depending on the amount of contribution, from several sentences or half of the page to a whole page. We will write or draw whatever the sponsor wishes, it could be a golden sentence, a part of the favourite book, a story written by the sponsor of his or her portrait, a dedication for a loved person, or anything else. The whole book will be photographed in high resolution , page by page, so that everyone will be able to see it and read the thoughts of our Founders.</p>
<p>The sponsors who pays over $250 will receive another special symbol of our gratitude – we will create a wooden shield with a crest designed by the sponsor. The shield may feature a personal symbol, a logo of a club, personal dedication, or whatever the sponsor sees fit. The shield will be hanging on the wall in the fort or tavern. Signed with the sponsor’s name and city.</p>
<p>Each person who contributes more than 25$ will receive a digital album sent by email, with photos depicting our work on the Fantasy Village, the games that took place there and the building team.</p>
<h3>Sponsor/patron?</h3>
<p>If you are a company owner or a person with a lot of money, we would be happy to discuss higher contributions individually. We would certainly find a beautiful, magical way to repay the company of organisations for support.  </p>
<h3>Would you like to have a Village like ours in your city?</h3>
<p>The building of Fantasy Village that has been taking place for the last two years has provided us with a lot of experience. Having no support, we managed to create the know-how, building and functioning strategies for such a village. If you want a place like that to appear in your location, let us know, and we will send a person from out most experienced team to help establish the project.   </p>
<h3>We're curious for Your feedback!</h3>
<p>It's our first try with crowdfunding, so we are really anxious how it's gonna work. We would really like to read Your feedback and answer all the questions You have for us. We will answer all the questions in the comments section. We will also make a video just for indiegogo as soon as we will have a technical possibility. Hope to hear from You soon!</p>

<h2><b>Why Titanium?</b></h2>
<p><b>TRAK is made from military grade titanium </b>(6AL4V), which is the same material used in professional touring bikes, aviation, race cars, and even the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.  The benefit of titanium is it's ultra-light weight, twice as strong as its equivalent in steel, rust proof, corrosion proof, and non ferrous (no iron). <b> Titanium is even used in surgical implants for its harmonizing factor with the human body.</b></p>

<i>Will Not Rust or Corrode- Even in Salt Water!</i><div>
<p> </p>
<p>Exposed to the elements (salt water, sweat, high humidity, dirt, etc), TRAK will not rust or corrode. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>Handcrafted in the USA</b></h2>
<p><b>TRAK is 100% hand crafted in the USA.</b>  The titanium is sourced in California and then sent to Texas where the blanks are cut out on a waterjet machine.  The raw TRAK cut-outs are then sent to our shop in Boston, MA where the cutting edge is hand ground.  From there we apply the following finishing treatments: stonewashing, bead blasting, color anodizing, final edge sharpening, tungsten carbide welded to edges, and hand stamped logos. </p>
<p>We then move on to the Kydex thermoplastic retention sheaths, which are also made one at a time, by hand.</p>

<h1>Reward Choices</h1>
<p><b>Important:</b></p>
<p>At the end of this campaign, you will receive via email, backer surveys, which will ask you for your color choice, size choice, finish, etc.  You do not need to do this now.  Just select your desired reward tier and we will collect all the other pertinent info from the surveys.</p>
<p>If ordering multiple rewards simply multiply the reward price by the number of items you would like.  Example: 1 TRAK is $29, 2 TRAK's $58, etc, etc.  Want color anodizing?  Simply add that to your reward total as well.</p>
<h3><b>Please Note:</b></h3>
<p>The TRAK knives shown in the video are only prototypes.  We experimented with different sized bevels, anodizing techniques, and finishes.  The final production version will be very close to the first picture at the top of this page.  Some prototypes seen in the video and pictures were used for reference or to demonstrate colors, sheath fit, function, and size comparison only.</p>

TRAK is the perfect knife for those running alone, biking, hiking, camping or just walking your dog.  Regardless of the environment, TRAK can handle it!  We found that TRAK not only came in handy in a marine environment, but found ourselves wearing it on our daily runs.  With TRAK, you're never alone.    What makes TRAK unique is that you place your index finger in the retention hole and wrap you thumb and middle finger around it. This makes dropping or having TRAK slip out of your hands virtually impossible.  Easy to wear around your neck with our neck sheath set-up, carry it on your keys, or zip tie it to your gear, purse, or backpack.  Simply throw it around your neck for a run or on a key ring for everyday tasks.

Why Titanium?
TRAK is made from military grade titanium (6AL4V), which is the same material used in professional touring bikes, aviation, race cars, and even the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.  The benefit of titanium is it's ultra-light weight, twice as strong as its equivalent in steel, rust proof, corrosion proof, and non ferrous (no iron).  Titanium is even used in surgical implants for its harmonizing factor with the human body.
 

Will Not Rust or Corrode- Even in Salt Water!
 
Exposed to the elements (salt water, sweat, high humidity, dirt, etc), TRAK will not rust or corrode. 
 
Handcrafted in the USA
TRAK is 100% hand crafted in the USA.  The titanium is sourced in California and then sent to Texas where the blanks are cut out on a waterjet machine.  The raw TRAK cut-outs are then sent to our shop in Boston, MA where the cutting edge is hand ground.  From there we apply the following finishing treatments: stonewashing, bead blasting, color anodizing, final edge sharpening, tungsten carbide welded to edges, and hand stamped logos. 
We then move on to the Kydex thermoplastic retention sheaths, which are also made one at a time, by hand.

Science has shown that music decreases perceived exertion, elevates energy levels, and increases endurance.</p><p>However, utilizing headsets or earphones can bring these joys of riding into a dangerous hault. With a maximum average volume of 105 decibels and talking volume of 40-60 decibels, it is difficult to be safely aware of your surroundings. The sounds from the car speeding forward from the behind and the motorcycle passing by are unable to be heard. In many countries including eight states in the U.S., wearing headphones/earphones while riding is illegal.</p><p>52 SPEAKER confidently allows you to safely and legally listen to your favorite tracks. 52 SPEAKER is mountable onto your handlebars to serenade your cycling trips. The volume is perfect for riding while still being cognizant of your surroundings and being courteous to fellow riders.

 It is proven by countless studies that listening to your favorite jams can make your ride more fun, intense, and fast. Science has shown that music decreases perceived exertion, elevates energy levels, and increases endurance.However, utilizing headsets or earphones can bring these joys of riding into a dangerous hault. With a maximum average volume of 105 decibels and talking volume of 40-60 decibels, it is difficult to be safely aware of your surroundings. The sounds from the car speeding forward from the behind and the motorcycle passing by are unable to be heard. In many countries including eight states in the U.S., wearing headphones/earphones while riding is illegal.52 SPEAKER confidently allows you to safely and legally listen to your favorite tracks. 52 SPEAKER is mountable onto your handlebars to serenade your cycling trips. The volume is perfect for riding while still being cognizant of your surroundings and being courteous to fellow riders. (In a crowd, use common sense and turn the volume down unless your neighbors ask you to turn it up!)52 SPEAKER can be attached in various positions on your bike with a holding mount and rubber rings, which are included in the box. It is firmly fixed only by placing and rotating, and detachment is just as simple. If you already have a GARMIN mount on your bike, you can also mount 52 SPEAKER directly on it with its compatible rear structure.The iconic control keys of 52 SPEAKER are designed for your convenience. Improving tactility and discriminability of the buttons of existing portable speakers, 52 SPEAKER can be controlled with gloved hands and even when you keep your eyes forwards. You can play, pause, and control the volume of the music, or move to next or previous songs seamlessly.                   Inspired by a hip flask, 52 SPEAKER boasts a sleek streamlined design with big buttons and a dial knob that are easily discriminable with fingers. 52 SPEAKER is small and light, enhancing tactility to make it optimized for outdoor activities.When we thought of the concept of a flask bottle, we knew we wanted to incorporate aspects of its design into 52 SPEAKER. People carry typically around hip flasks for convenience to drink beverages and enjoy leisurely time during their journeys. This theme matched the concept of 52 SPEAKER and what we wanted it to represent.I’m a bike rider. I know how much joy and energy that music can add to my bike riding adventures. I’ve searched for a handy, mountable speaker that I could use but could not find one. They were too large, too bulky, or too complicated to attach on my bike. So I decided to make a small, compacted bike speaker that I myself would want to use.I’m also a product designer. I’ve designed and successfully introduced sound systems, TVs, and monitors to the market while working at SAMSUNG, but I've always wanted to make a sleek and advanced product on my own terms. After lots of trials and errors for two years, 52 SPEAKER has now been finalized in the manufacturing process and is preparing for mass production. This campaign's funding is for our full-out kickoff of mass production.Now we are TEAM 52. Starting with 52 SPEAKER, we look forward to continuously introducing groundbreaking products under the theme “Our Precious 52 Weekends”. We hope 52 SPEAKER will ensure that all of your 52 weekends (in a year) are blissful and memorable.





52 SPEAKER has two sound modes. In ACTIVITY mode, you can enjoy enhanced, crisp sound tuned for noisy and windy outdoor riding environment. In NORMAL mode, you can enjoy rich, deep sound suitable for general, everyday use.

</p><p><b> Every need or convenience that we
have in life today usually stems from a problem or an inconvenience one might say, mine personally was a big one.  In 2010
I woke to a pain in my mid back </b></p><p><b>
T-7 vertebrae to be exact. Not too much pain at first but it was annoying and more
noticeable as time when on I decided to go to a Chiropractor when conventional
medicine was not doing the trick.<br/><br/>
I told mentioned the problem (T-7 pain) and he quickly wrenched my body around
including my neck and explained it as, (you need your whole body adjusted for this to
work.)  The next day I woke with a feeling  like a golf ball in the
throat.  It felt very uncomfortable and quickly turned to pain and I mean
pain!  uncontrollable level 10 pain! <br/>
 <br/>
I want to get to the point but this is important for potential backers to
hear.  I spent 18 months with this pain level , $5000.00 on doctors, had
every test done under the sun!  Nothing took the pain away and no Doctor
could ever tell me what was wrong. I refused to take any heavy pain killers or
drugs because I do not believe in masking pain,  I believe in healing it. <br/><br/>
At this moment I was almost at the point of no return, could not work could
barely think straight When my Brother came to me with this project he was
working on for jet engines at Allied Technologies it  seemed that they
needed bright light to see certain moving pieces in the engine.  He had
this Laser device he had made. He mentioned to me that it had
benefits for pain although he designed it for pointing. I used it for about 15
minutes a day.  Now remember Nothing has worked for me NOTHING! The first
few days I felt little to no change but By the third day 45 minutes total use I
woke up feeling at least 50% better.  I was so freaked out I took the
thing and used it for 45 minute sessions for one week. After $5000.00 in doctor
bills no so called expert in the field of medicine never mentioned this? 
NEWS FLASH I HAD 9TH CRANIAL NERVE DAMAGE AND THE LASER REPAIRED THE NERVES!</b></p><p><b>An Image of our First Red LED Laser <br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/439312/files/20140317073408-firstlaser.jpg?1395066848"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b>
Now the best part<br/><br/>
After one week I had ZERO pain!  Yes Zero.  You can not imagine how I
felt and have felt ever since, back in the gym working on my many projects
again.  As I used this laser I noticed something else it was doing, It was
tightening my skin to a point where I was looking much younger,
the laser takes wrinkles right off your face. Then I started to become sort of
an advocate for what is called soft laser light and the effects on the Human
Body.<br/><br/>
Then it hit me Why not try to get the word, out take our crude laser, Give it a
face lift and  mass produce it,  We want a soft laser in the hands of
everyone! That is why we need your help.  We ask you ,If we could put one
of these in your hands (with benefits We will explain of course) for less then
dinner for two at a family restaurant would you back us? Well if you said yes keep
reading below and we will explain exactly what we are offering backers for this
campaign. We have plans to open a factory And use R&amp;D to design a full Led
Bed Like a tanning bed but instead of damaging your cells Our bed will be total

<br/><br/></div>","Every need or convenience that we
have in life today usually stems from a problem or an inconvenience one might say, mine personally was a big one.  In 2010
I woke to a pain in my mid back 
T-7 vertebrae to be exact. Not too much pain at first but it was annoying and more
noticeable as time when on I decided to go to a Chiropractor when conventional
medicine was not doing the trick.
I told mentioned the problem (T-7 pain) and he quickly wrenched my body around
including my neck and explained it as, (you need your whole body adjusted for this to
work.)  The next day I woke with a feeling  like a golf ball in the
throat.  It felt very uncomfortable and quickly turned to pain and I mean
pain!  uncontrollable level 10 pain! 
 
I want to get to the point but this is important for potential backers to
hear.  I spent 18 months with this pain level , $5000.00 on doctors, had
every test done under the sun!  Nothing took the pain away and no Doctor
could ever tell me what was wrong. I refused to take any heavy pain killers or
drugs because I do not believe in masking pain,  I believe in healing it. 
At this moment I was almost at the point of no return, could not work could
barely think straight When my Brother came to me with this project he was
working on for jet engines at Allied Technologies it  seemed that they
needed bright light to see certain moving pieces in the engine.  He had
this Laser device he had made. He mentioned to me that it had
benefits for pain although he designed it for pointing. I used it for about 15
minutes a day.  Now remember Nothing has worked for me NOTHING! The first
few days I felt little to no change but By the third day 45 minutes total use I
woke up feeling at least 50% better.  I was so freaked out I took the
thing and used it for 45 minute sessions for one week. After $5000.00 in doctor
bills no so called expert in the field of medicine never mentioned this? 
NEWS FLASH I HAD 9TH CRANIAL NERVE DAMAGE AND THE LASER REPAIRED THE NERVES!An Image of our First Red LED Laser 
Now the best part
After one week I had ZERO pain!  Yes Zero.  You can not imagine how I
felt and have felt ever since, back in the gym working on my many projects
again.  As I used this laser I noticed something else it was doing, It was
tightening my skin to a point where I was looking much younger,
the laser takes wrinkles right off your face. Then I started to become sort of
an advocate for what is called soft laser light and the effects on the Human
Body.
Then it hit me Why not try to get the word, out take our crude laser, Give it a
face lift and  mass produce it,  We want a soft laser in the hands of
everyone! That is why we need your help.  We ask you ,If we could put one
of these in your hands (with benefits We will explain of course) for less then
dinner for two at a family restaurant would you back us? Well if you said yes keep
reading below and we will explain exactly what we are offering backers for this
campaign. We have plans to open a factory And use R&D to design a full Led
Bed Like a tanning bed but instead of damaging your cells Our bed will be total
body rejuvenation, along with many other projects to bring Cold laser main
stream without the expense of clinical visits 
We are using all funding for creation and
Distribution. Backers will receive very special price before launch Please read Below to realize the miracle of LED Soft Laser Light

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Invisible Borders Trans-African Photographic Initiative</strong> is an art-led initiative, founded in Nigeria in 2009 by passionate Nigerian artists – mostly photographers – with a drive and urge to effect change in the society. It was registered in 2011 under the Cooperate Affairs Commission (CAC) of Nigeria as Invisible Borders Trans-African Photographers Organisation. The vision of the initiative is to become a symbol of networking and trans-border associations within the arts and photography in Africa, but also to become a stepping-stone platform for young immerging talents in the continent in such a way that it creates a breeding ground for young artist to be thinking beyond borders at the beginning stage of their creative quest.</p>
<p>Our mission is to tell Africa’s stories, by Africans, through photography and inspiring artistic interventions; to encourage exposure of upcoming African photographers towards art and photography as practiced in other parts of the continent.; to establish a platform that encourages and embraces trans- African artistic relationships within the continent, and to contribute towards the socio-political discourse shaping Africa of the 21st Century.</p>
<p>Our goal is to constantly spread and share knowledge and information, cutting across the demarcating lines of classes and proficiency in literacy, thereby expanding the art public to include more of the local audience and the “layman”.</p>
<p> The main activity /project of the Initiative since its foundation has been The Invisible Borders Trans-African Road Trip Project. Every year,  up to ten artists - photographers, writers, flimmakers and art historians come together to embark on a road trip across Africa to explore and participate in various photographic events, festival and exhibitions while engaging on a daily basis with the environment and the people encountered. The emphasis is primarily on the collective journey of the participating artists who, during their momentary stops in capital cities, create photographic, video and textual works that often reflect their individual approach to engaging with local artists, art practitioners and the inhabitants. During the trip, we maintain a daily blog by which we share a glimpse of the experiences of the road trip with our numerous followers all over the world.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to creating works, which portray the dynamism, richness as well as contradictions of the various modes of existence of the African people. In doing this, they reject a simplified notion of Africa nor a tidy definition of it, but instead hopes to create an archive of works which “complicates” the depiction of contemporary Africa, one which sees the continent as work-in-progress, rather than a foregone conclusion</p>
<p> We  therefore see the Invisible Borders Road trip as a workshop of artistic creation and a performative social intervention all rolled into one. Moreover it offers that unique experience of “learning in motion” and discovering oneself through interactions with diverse encounters by constantly altering one’s own reality through constant movement.</p>
<p> So far there has been three editions of the road trip. The first edition was in 2009 with ten participants: nine photographers, and a writer who travelled from Lagos, Nigeria to Bamako Mali with stops in Benin, Ghana, Togo and Burkina Fasso. In 2010, the group travelled with ten participants from Lagos to Dakar and in 2011, from Lagos to Addis Ababa. All the three editions have been well documented in a blog. After the trips the workshops, conferences and exhibitions were organized in Bamako (2009), Lagos (2009 and 2010), Abuja (2010), Dakar (2010), Addis Ababa (2010), Bern Museum Switzerland (2010), Berlin (April2011), New York (2012) where the outcome and experiences of the two editions were shared with the public and students.</p>
<p>This year, we are gearing up for the 4th edition of the Road Trip project. This year includes artists from Nigeria, South Africa, Rwanda,Mozambique and Congo DR. We will travel from Lagos, Nigeria to Lubumbashi, Congo DR spending 49 days on the trip. The project is scheduled for the 23rd of August through the 9th of October 2012. This journey will prove to be an ardous one with lots of rough terrains and some 13,000 kilometres to crunch. We are ever determined to achieve this and bring home with us countless experiences which will benefit anyone who would want to make similar trips in the future. Therefore if you are passioante about the continent of Africa and the myriad stories yet untold then our project is worth the support and this will go a long way to make the project a success.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We do have some funds from a few organizations, but what we have so far is not enough to cater for our expense during the trip. We need an additional 20,000 USD in order to be where we need to be financially. If you donate towards our project, you will be contributing towards the cost of transportation, feeding and accomodation of the artists during the 49 days of the road trip project. Also you will help ensure that we have enough money to take care of some contingent situation which from experience is usally the case with these trips. Traveling by road in Africa is about improvisation and being prepared to deal with unforeseen circumstances, and a big part of this has to do with having adequate funds. </p>
<p>Oh yes! we do have something to give back in return, depending on the amount you contribute. From making your name available on the ""Individuals in Collaboration"" section of our website, to giving out unique Invisible Borders 2012 T-shirts, up to publishing your name as a crowd funder in the very first Invisible Borders Coffee Table book scheduled to be launched in May 2013. We will also give out collector's copies of the book to our generous contributors. But that's not all, We will also give signed collectors photo print from the 2012 edition of the Trip. </p>
<p>Even if we don't meet the 20,000 USD mark, whatever we get will go a long way to help in the project. It might prove to be much more challenging than we had envisaged. We may have to sleep in shabby hotels and sometimes in our van, but in the least our vehicle wil have enough gas and oil to carry us all the way to and fro! </p>

<p>Your contribution will help keep the campaign of No Borders by our initiative alive, and to promote Trans-African exchanges. Moreover in making these road trip, we are presenting the world with alternatives to the stories and media representation of the Continent.

We are sensitising the minds of Africans of our generation to become proactive as regards issues saddling the continent. </p>
<p> The results of the past three editions are that eleven emerging photographers and three writers have gained first national/international exposure, and that the website, the blog, and the follow-up workshops are gradually becoming a strong resource and database for art researchers, and interested collaborators. It has also commenced an “Image Bank project”, in order to make available all the images to users across the continent and the world at large. We have also earned the partnership of reputable organizations and firms such as Canon Europe (who gave us cameras and video equipment), HIVOS, Institut Francais, New Museum of New York, Prince Claus, the Ministry of culture of Mali, Embassy of Nigeria in Addis Ababa, Art Moves Africa, and Museum of Modern Arts Addis Ababa, etc.</p>
<p>We have also had media coverage from New York Times, Jeune Afrique Afrique France and numerous online blogs. Please feel free to go on google to learn more about the project.</p>

Over 1,000 people have viewed this campaign, and I still have not gotten any feedback as to why people don't want to support this.

<p>My name is Troy Hawkins, from Boise, Idaho.  I’m asking for your help to make a pet safety invention of mine a reality.  I need to raise $40,000 in order to hire an engineering design firm to construct a prototype and conduct product testing. This is the lowest of four quotes I have recieved. With a working prototype, I will be able to either sell my invention or raise the necessary capital to manufacture them myself.</p>
<p>At this point, I have reached the limits of my financial resources, as well as my engineering skills. I need professionals to complete my work by determining the right materials to use, calculate power usage and heat transfer and refining the manufacturing process. Then it's on to testing to make sure that the Pet Cooling System is durable, long-lasting and maintenance free,</p>
<p>For your <strong>$5</strong> contribution, I am going to send you ten e-books. These are great references to use for dog training, understanding behavior and canine nutrition. Use them yourself or give them to someone you know who is getting a dog or puppy for the first time.  Most are easy to read and understandable by children, so they make terrific gifts for new pet parents.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">About my invention:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Helps your dog regulate body temperature.</li>
<li>Prevents heat exhaustion and heat stroke.</li>
<li>Can be used anywhere there's power, or for up to one hour on the internal battery.</li>
<li>Requires no maintainence from the owner, beyond washing the cover.</li>
<li>Safe, non-toxic materials.</li>
<li>You know that your pet always has a safe, cool spot, even if your A/C breaks or power goes out.</li>
</ul><p>You've probably noticed that your dog likes to lay on cool surfaces that draw away excess heat. Even if you feel comfortable, your dog wouldn't mind it being a few degrees cooler. Hence, the Pet Cooling System. It gives your pet a cool, comfortable place to lay down, that is going to remain cool. Your pet doesn't have to get up and find a new spot after the old one warms up. No more tripping over your dog on a middle of the night bathroom run. Use it outside and your pet won't need to dig up your flower beds to find cool dirt to lay on. Put it in the bedroom, family or living room and your dog can have it's own comfortably cool spot near the people it loves. The Pet Cooling System contains an internal rechargeable battery, so even if the power goes out while you're away from home, you have the piece of mind knowing that your beloved pet still has a safe and cool spot in the house without the air conditioning running.</p>
<p>The Pet Cooling System is made up of four components. </p>
<ol>
<li>The Control Unit: Using existing, proven cooling technology, the Control Unit continuously chills and circulates water and air. It contains the rechargeable battery and temperature controls.</li>
<li>The Cooling Pad: This 4’ x 2’ pad contains tubing that the chilled water circulates through. When your pet lays on the Cooling Pad, heat is drawn out of its body and carried back to the Control Unit, where it is expelled.  The Cooling Pad looks like any dog bed and is filled with foam for comfort and has a removable cover for easy cleaning.</li>
<li>The Cooling Tube: These small perforated tubes are designed to continuously blow cool air over the Cooling Pad where your pet is laying, helping to control its core body temperature.</li>
<li>The Stay-Cool Water Dish: This incredible device keeps your pet’s water, cool, clean and moving. It continuously circulates up to one gallon of water through a filter and chiller, removing debris, hair and other contaminants (like slobber) and keeping the water cool, refreshing and inviting. It draws power from the Control Unit, so it also continues to function if the power goes out.</li>
</ol><p>The versatility of the Pet Cooling System is what makes it such a great invention. You can use it practically anywhere. Inside the home, out on the deck, in your dog’s kennel or dog house, at the park, at a campsite, in an RV, on a boat, and yes; even in your car. It can be packed up in just a few seconds and taken with you wherever you and your pet go. With the Pet Cooling System, your pet will always have a cool, comfortable place to escape the heat and stay safe from the threat of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.</p>
<p>Based on my research, I believe that the Pet Cooling System, when mass produced, can have a retail cost of $80-$110, making it very affordable for any pet owner.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help in making the Pet Cooling System a reality!</p></div>","*** UPDATE 29 OCT, 2012:

Prevents heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
Can be used anywhere there's power, or for up to one hour on the internal battery.
Requires no maintainence from the owner, beyond washing the cover.
Safe, non-toxic materials.
You know that your pet always has a safe, cool spot, even if your A/C breaks or power goes out.
You've probably noticed that your dog likes to lay on cool surfaces that draw away excess heat. Even if you feel comfortable, your dog wouldn't mind it being a few degrees cooler. Hence, the Pet Cooling System. It gives your pet a cool, comfortable place to lay down, that is going to remain cool. Your pet doesn't have to get up and find a new spot after the old one warms up. No more tripping over your dog on a middle of the night bathroom run. Use it outside and your pet won't need to dig up your flower beds to find cool dirt to lay on. Put it in the bedroom, family or living room and your dog can have it's own comfortably cool spot near the people it loves. The Pet Cooling System contains an internal rechargeable battery, so even if the power goes out while you're away from home, you have the piece of mind knowing that your beloved pet still has a safe and cool spot in the house without the air conditioning running.
The Pet Cooling System is made up of four components. 

The Control Unit: Using existing, proven cooling technology, the Control Unit continuously chills and circulates water and air. It contains the rechargeable battery and temperature controls.
The Cooling Pad: This 4’ x 2’ pad contains tubing that the chilled water circulates through. When your pet lays on the Cooling Pad, heat is drawn out of its body and carried back to the Control Unit, where it is expelled.  The Cooling Pad looks like any dog bed and is filled with foam for comfort and has a removable cover for easy cleaning.
The Cooling Tube: These small perforated tubes are designed to continuously blow cool air over the Cooling Pad where your pet is laying, helping to control its core body temperature.
The Stay-Cool Water Dish: This incredible device keeps your pet’s water, cool, clean and moving. It continuously circulates up to one gallon of water through a filter and chiller, removing debris, hair and other contaminants (like slobber) and keeping the water cool, refreshing and inviting. It draws power from the Control Unit, so it also continues to function if the power goes out.
The versatility of the Pet Cooling System is what makes it such a great invention. You can use it practically anywhere. Inside the home, out on the deck, in your dog’s kennel or dog house, at the park, at a campsite, in an RV, on a boat, and yes; even in your car. It can be packed up in just a few seconds and taken with you wherever you and your pet go. With the Pet Cooling System, your pet will always have a cool, comfortable place to escape the heat and stay safe from the threat of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
Based on my research, I believe that the Pet Cooling System, when mass produced, can have a retail cost of $80-$110, making it very affordable for any pet owner.
Thank you for your help in making the Pet Cooling System a reality!",1.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Contact us whenever you like if you want to plan your stay on our islands. Now we are able to finish the bungalow on the second island and it will be available for you in August 2019. But as mentioned many times, you can also stay on our living island, what is an exclusive right and will not be available anymore in that form when the campaign is finished. </p><p><i><strong>--Update 1--</strong></i></p><p>Many people contact us, because they are interested in their own island in the region. We are happy to give advice. But we cannot consult everybody in detail, mainly because of low internet availability. We must focus, and we focus on people who back our campaign on Indiegogo. So from now on a <strong>consultation about obtaining your own island</strong> is included in every perk.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></p><p>My name is Bernd and I live since one year on a lonely island in Indonesia/Sumatra.  The region is called Pulau Banyak, what means ""many islands"" and that's exactly what it is. There are ~60 lonely islands close to each other, of all kind of shapes and sizes. The islands I rented are in the middle of the region and many other lonely islands are all around. <strong>For me it is the most beautiful place on earth </strong>and the perfect location for cast away fantasies and eco tourism.</p><h3>2 islands, same same but different</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558375953/iyps5p6hqsptv9kssnay.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The island where we live on and where backers can stay, too</i></p><p>The island where me and my friends live on is a <strong>non-commercial</strong> project. It is like an art project or an adventure playground for adults. We try to live there as self sustained as possible. We build shelters and furniture out of driftwood. We plant vegetables and go fishing for food. We made our dreams become reality. <strong>Everybody who supports us can stay on this island and realize his own ideas. Already now guaranteed!</strong></p><p>On the other island we build a <strong>bungalow for tourists based on a unique cast away concept</strong>. We want to create the feeling, that somebody has been stranded on the island for a long time and build his ""home"" by using available material and resources. <strong>To finish this bungalow we need your support!</strong></p><h3><strong>The design concept for the cast away bungalow</strong></h3><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558376168/kul4tluuymoiinu5yefp.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Current state of the cast away bungalow</i></p><p>The design of the bungalow is natural and organic. For supporting elements we use wood, processed appropriately for long-term durability. But we also use a lot of driftwood for decoration, <strong>to make the look and feel as authentic as possible</strong>. We won't use any plastic or other modern materials like glass, although a modern cast away would probably use a lot of plastic for building his shelter. <strong>The design concept is all about the atmosphere. </strong></p><p>We cannot say how exactly the final bungalow will look like because like a cast away we are constantly looking for ""loot"", which we can use for the bungalow and other parts. The whole design concept is like a cast away story. </p><h3><strong>Design details for an even more authentic experience</strong></h3><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558376259/vhj6vyihmklbjm9vpfhf.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>For us, details are very important! For example the lightning will be natural too with oil lamps, torches, campfire and so on. Together with a strong milky way, glowing algae and storm lightnings at the horizon, it will create <strong>a unique night experience you will never forget</strong>. Electrical lights are too dominant and swallow all the nature lightning around the island.</p><p>The kitchen will be a stone oven and wood is used for heating it up. Learn more about food service in the ""service"" section"".</p><p>As much as possible will be improvised on the island as a cast away has no shop to buy anything. Drinking cups for example will be out of bamboo and nautilus shells. <strong>Everything should fit to the story</strong>. Of course equipment which cannot be improvised like kayaks or snorkeling masks will be normal. Improvising is just a method to make the <strong>experience as authentic as possible</strong>.</p><p>There will be also some other, more hidden details. Guests can find a riddle scratched in a wooden object. If they solve it they can find other riddles which finally lead to a hidden treasure, probably a bottle of rum. In the attic floor of the bungalow, guests can find a hidden room with more mysteries to discover. </p><h3><strong>Additional Service by our staff</strong></h3><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558376653/lu83xbkov69auuwopfer.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Our hello kitty boat, used for supporting our guests​</i></p><p>Tourists <strong>can live on the island as self sustained as they want</strong>.

<li>
<strong>Snorkeling</strong>: There are many corals and a lot of sea life right next to both islands and all around. Snorkeling equipment is available for guests.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kayaking</strong>: Pulau Banyak is probably one of the best places in the world for ocean kayaking. From the cast away island you can reach more than 20 lonely islands with your kayak. We provide a self-made map to our guests where many hotspots like good snorkeling locations are marked. 2 ocean kayaks are available for guests.</li>
<li>
<strong>Island hopping</strong>: Either guests use the available kayaks for exploring other islands or they can book a motorboat tour with us to visit some more far away islands.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exploring fascinating sea life</strong>: The sea life in Pulau Banyak is very diversified and after one year of living there we still discover something new every other day. For example dolphins are very common in the area. We know how to find them and can bring guests there. Also Dugongs (sea cows) are quite common, but they are very shy. They can be best seen by kayak, you have just to make sure to be at the right spot in the right time. You can even meet whales while snorkeling!</li>
<li>
<strong>Jungle treks</strong>: On the bigger islands is a lot of untouched jungle. You can climb up a 400m high jungle mountain, explore caves and waterfalls or visit hidden paradise beaches. We can organize these and other trips for you.</li>
<li>
<strong>Traditional village culture</strong>: There are 3 bigger and some smaller local villages on 2 of the biggest islands. The people there are quite isolated and thus the traditional culture is strong. You can experience local food, local dances &amp; celebrations and even traditional shaman medicine.</li>
<li>
<strong>Surfing</strong>: Surfing is possible, but the best spots are quite far away from our islands. Beginner surfing is possible close by.</li>
<li>
<strong>Diving</strong>: Of course the region is also perfect for diving. However, diving equipment is not available. Feel free to bring your own diving equipment. There are a lot of untouched spots to discover, already 100 m away from our islands!</li>

Contact us whenever you like if you want to plan your stay on our islands. Now we are able to finish the bungalow on the second island and it will be available for you in August 2019. But as mentioned many times, you can also stay on our living island, what is an exclusive right and will not be available anymore in that form when the campaign is finished. --Update 1--Many people contact us, because they are interested in their own island in the region. We are happy to give advice. But we cannot consult everybody in detail, mainly because of low internet availability. We must focus, and we focus on people who back our campaign on Indiegogo. So from now on a consultation about obtaining your own island is included in every perk.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------My name is Bernd and I live since one year on a lonely island in Indonesia/Sumatra.  The region is called Pulau Banyak, what means ""many islands"" and that's exactly what it is. There are ~60 lonely islands close to each other, of all kind of shapes and sizes. The islands I rented are in the middle of the region and many other lonely islands are all around. For me it is the most beautiful place on earth and the perfect location for cast away fantasies and eco tourism.2 islands, same same but differentThe island where we live on and where backers can stay, tooThe island where me and my friends live on is a non-commercial project. It is like an art project or an adventure playground for adults. We try to live there as self sustained as possible. We build shelters and furniture out of driftwood. We plant vegetables and go fishing for food. We made our dreams become reality. Everybody who supports us can stay on this island and realize his own ideas. Already now guaranteed!On the other island we build a bungalow for tourists based on a unique cast away concept. We want to create the feeling, that somebody has been stranded on the island for a long time and build his ""home"" by using available material and resources. To finish this bungalow we need your support!The design concept for the cast away bungalowCurrent state of the cast away bungalowThe design of the bungalow is natural and organic. For supporting elements we use wood, processed appropriately for long-term durability. But we also use a lot of driftwood for decoration, to make the look and feel as authentic as possible. We won't use any plastic or other modern materials like glass, although a modern cast away would probably use a lot of plastic for building his shelter. The design concept is all about the atmosphere. We cannot say how exactly the final bungalow will look like because like a cast away we are constantly looking for ""loot"", which we can use for the bungalow and other parts. The whole design concept is like a cast away story. Design details for an even more authentic experienceFor us, details are very important! For example the lightning will be natural too with oil lamps, torches, campfire and so on. Together with a strong milky way, glowing algae and storm lightnings at the horizon, it will create a unique night experience you will never forget. Electrical lights are too dominant and swallow all the nature lightning around the island.The kitchen will be a stone oven and wood is used for heating it up. Learn more about food service in the ""service"" section"".As much as possible will be improvised on the island as a cast away has no shop to buy anything. Drinking cups for example will be out of bamboo and nautilus shells. Everything should fit to the story. Of course equipment which cannot be improvised like kayaks or snorkeling masks will be normal. Improvising is just a method to make the experience as authentic as possible.There will be also some other, more hidden details. Guests can find a riddle scratched in a wooden object. If they solve it they can find other riddles which finally lead to a hidden treasure, probably a bottle of rum. In the attic floor of the bungalow, guests can find a hidden room with more mysteries to discover. Additional Service by our staffOur hello kitty boat, used for supporting our guests​Tourists can live on the island as self sustained as they want. They have everything they need to stay there alone. We provide raw food to them, fresh water, fishing equipment and much more.But we live on the other island, which is just 500 meters away and we offer all kind of optional services to the guests on the cast away island. Tourists can order food, power banks, transport, tours and other things if they want these kinds of additional services. They can also visit us with their kayaks and eat in our restaurant.Activities available for tourists & backersKayaking is the most fun and most eco friendly way to explore the region

Snorkeling: There are many corals and a lot of sea life right next to both islands and all around. Snorkeling equipment is available for guests.

Kayaking: Pulau Banyak is probably one of the best places in the world for ocean kayaking. From the cast away island you can reach more than 20 lonely islands with your kayak. We provide a self-made map to our guests where many hotspots like good snorkeling locations are marked. 2 ocean kayaks are available for guests.

Island hopping: Either guests use the available kayaks for exploring other islands or they can book a motorboat tour with us to visit some more far away islands.

Exploring fascinating sea life: The sea life in Pulau Banyak is very diversified and after one year of living there we still discover something new every other day. For example dolphins are very common in the area. We know how to find them and can bring guests there. Also Dugongs (sea cows) are quite common, but they are very shy. They can be best seen by kayak, you have just to make sure to be at the right spot in the right time. You can even meet whales while snorkeling!

Jungle treks: On the bigger islands is a lot of untouched jungle. You can climb up a 400m high jungle mountain, explore caves and waterfalls or visit hidden paradise beaches. We can organize these and other trips for you.

Traditional village culture: There are 3 bigger and some smaller local villages on 2 of the biggest islands. The people there are quite isolated and thus the traditional culture is strong. You can experience local food, local dances & celebrations and even traditional shaman medicine.

Surfing: Surfing is possible, but the best spots are quite far away from our islands. Beginner surfing is possible close by.

Diving: Of course the region is also perfect for diving. However, diving equipment is not available. Feel free to bring your own diving equipment. There are a lot of untouched spots to discover, already 100 m away from our islands!
The building process & its costsOur local partners are preparing the wood for buildingNow we need to finish the bungalow, the kitchen, the toilet and the shower on the cast away island. We build together with locals. Our local partner fully understands the concept and we work perfectly as a team. We also have learned a lot last year while building on the other island.To finish the basic accommodation we need the following budget:
Building material: 1.900 $
Salary for local builders: 1.000 $
Building tools & transport: 600 $
Water tank: 150 $
Furniture & equipment: 300 $
If there is additional money from Indiegogo, we will use it for:
2 ocean kayaks: 1.800 $ (the current kayaks are only borrowed)
Improving all parts of the accommodation
Timing: We can finish the accommodation in one month if the budget is available but it also depends on the weather. Our plan is to have the island ready for guests until end of July.Benefits for backing us on IndiegogoAs a backer you have the exclusive right to stay on our islands! Depending on the amount you pledge, you can stay either on the cast away island when the accommodation is finished, including all services available also for paying guests.But everybody can stay on the support island, where we live on! Sleep in a hammock or in a simple bungalows if free. Use our equipment like snorkeling gear, gas cooker and solar. Go fishing with our spear gun or play with our animals. You can even realize own ideas if they fit to the concept (build something, make some art, improve the garden or whatever you are interested in). Don't think about it too much, just come here and let yourself being inspired by the environment.Unfortunately, we cannot send you something, you have to come here to collect most of your reward, but the reward is already now guaranteed! The islands exists, the basic infrastructure exists, the experience exists and you could come tomorrow.Testimonials & FeedbackA simple bungalow on the island where we live, available for backers, tooAs a test run we rented the island, where we usually live on, 2 times to tourists via AirBnB and this is their feedback:""This place is incredible!

Why is there always so much stuff to carry around? Surely there's an easier way? Well now there is. After talking to hundreds of parents and childcare professionals about the challenges of taking children outdoors we designed what we believed could be the world's most functional bag and rug in one, the Brug.The Brug doubles up as a bag and a rug; it's hard wearing, versatile and water resistant. It’s easy to use and works equally well indoors and outdoors.Brug v1.0 was launched in 2016, funded by our own savings. We sold out our first production run and had great feedback from our customers but we knew we could make it even better. After 6 months of hard work and a trip to India to meet with our manufacturers, we developed the prototype for Brug v2.0, which we believe to be the perfect and most functional bag and rug in one.Following our successful 2017 Kickstarter campaign, we've moved to Indiegogo Indemand to maintain the momentum!We're offering large discounts to backers on Kickstarter in return for supporting us at this early stage of our business. The Brug is available in navy blue with a choice of yellow and orange trim. We will endeavour to deliver your chosen colour, however it's possible that we won't be able to give all backers their first choice. Wunderlife was founded by Melissa and Dominique with a vision to develop products that make life a little bit easier for all of us. As parents we know how time pressured family life can be. We're based in Edinburgh, UK and are passionate about what we do. We gave up our jobs to dedicate our time and energy to making Wunderlife and the Brug the greatest success it can be. We met in Edinburgh in 2014. We are both busy working mums with a common passion, which is to develop products that make it easier to enjoy the important things in life, like travelling, sport and the outdoors. Not just for families but for anybody with an active lifestyle. We saw an opportunity in working together and Wunderlife was born. We then met Felix, who takes pride in designing quality products that people love, particularly textiles products. He also enjoys travelling and the outdoors so between us we saw a good opportunity to create and deliver something really special.We are excited by products that are versatile, hard wearing and work in all sorts of environments. Our dream was to develop a product that makes packing for a day out really easy, cuts down on the number of things to take and stores easily when not being used. Something that could be used for any outdoor activity but would work equally well in the home, to tidy up after children and protect surfaces from the inevitable messy spills. In short, we imagined the perfect solution to many of our headaches. And so, the Brug was born!

 
  Our customers loved Brug V1.0 but we knew we could make it even better with the addition of some carefully considered features. We believe these key changes make the Brug the most perfectly functional bag and rug in one.The Brug is all about functionality, versatility and ease of use. Our starting point was to design a product that makes life with kids easier. However, we also researched it amongst many people who don't have kids but lead active lives, with pets, travelling and sport, to understand how the Brug could address as many needs as possible. Following our research, we moved quickly from sketches to prototyping, trialling and testing to refine the design and develop a production ready sample of Brug v2.0 to launch into the market.Our manufacturing partner has been with us from the beginning and we’re delighted with the quality of workmanship and their ethical business practice. We will be as proactive as possible to ensure that we distribute the goods as quickly as we can.

So far, House of Musical Traditions and Main Street Takoma have pledged $200 each, totaling $400.  The Olive Lounge will host a fundraiser the evening of April 10 and give 15% of their proceeds to the Summer Drum Circles.  That means we're almost half of our way already!  


Please pitch in whatever you can to keep the heartbeat alive and well in Takoma Park! Whether it’s $1, $5, $25 or $100, your support will make a difference!!!

<h3>My story:</h3>
<p>My name is Jeff Smith, I am 53 years old, I have 2 false hips and I want to climb Mount Everest and inspire our future generation. I started climbing in 2010 and over the years have climbed many mountains raising money for charity (in total I have raised almost £100,000).</p>

<p>I'm doing the challenge for fun and also to raise money for a charity which has helped me move forward with my life. Heal For Life is a charity for survivors of childhood trauma and abuse. They offer a five day residential therapy program aimed at healing the traumatised child within and helping people take steps to start living a more fulfilled existence. </p>
<p>I took part in their first UK program in May this year and found it a revelation. It really helped me work through difficult issues that I'd been holding onto and it's no exaggeration to say it was life changing. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My childhood was difficult. I spent time in foster care as my mother battled with debilitating mental health problems. Eventually she took her own life and I had to come to terms with my grief. As a young man I held onto my pain, which eventually took hold and pushed me into the dark pit of depression. I found therapy extremely difficult; it helped but I never really trusted the process.

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></div>","I leave for the Balkans on the 27th September, flying into Belgrade and flying out of Skopje. I will cycle solo through Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania and Macedonia, covering around 1000Km whilst battling the elements, mountains, wild camping and a temperamental bicycle. 




I'm doing the challenge for fun and also to raise money for a charity which has helped me move forward with my life. Heal For Life is a charity for survivors of childhood trauma and abuse. They offer a five day residential therapy program aimed at healing the traumatised child within and helping people take steps to start living a more fulfilled existence. 
I took part in their first UK program in May this year and found it a revelation. It really helped me work through difficult issues that I'd been holding onto and it's no exaggeration to say it was life changing. My childhood was difficult. I spent time in foster care as my mother battled with debilitating mental health problems. Eventually she took her own life and I had to come to terms with my grief. As a young man I held onto my pain, which eventually took hold and pushed me into the dark pit of depression. I found therapy extremely difficult; it helped but I never really trusted the process. The Heal for Life program was different. All the carers were survivors themselves and you have a full five days away from the world to work on your issues. The setting really allowed for drastic work to be done. The techniques are backed up by scientific research, tangible and effective. 
I'm aiming to raise £2000 which will go into the sponsorship fund that supports people who cannot afford to pay for the course themselves. Heal For Life is a not-for-profit organisation and the course costs £400 per person, so if I reach my goal we will be supporting five people on their healing journey. As they say every penny counts and I really appreciate every donation no matter how small or large.

<div>""<i>A DIVEVOLK Diving Assistant with a lens, and your can add one more light if you go deeper, those are all you need. It is the revolution of underwater photography. It is the most compact set I have ever used so far and it has the widest angle with my lens due to short distance between the lens and the iPhone camera. For macro photography, the fillter function and manual  ISO/S settings provided by the customized app is very helpful and you can even touch the phone's screen to focus the  subject and the focus will remains for 5 seconds to allow easy photography. It is amazing!  </i>""- Joe Chang</div>

""A DIVEVOLK Diving Assistant with a lens, and your can add one more light if you go deeper, those are all you need. It is the revolution of underwater photography. It is the most compact set I have ever used so far and it has the widest angle with my lens due to short distance between the lens and the iPhone camera. For macro photography, the fillter function and manual  ISO/S settings provided by the customized app is very helpful and you can even touch the phone's screen to focus the  subject and the focus will remains for 5 seconds to allow easy photography. It is amazing!  ""- Joe Chang

Diving Assistant: Use iPhone underwater Just Like on Land

Today, smartphones, with their most powerful hardware and software applications, are bringing communication, convenience, entertainment and much more to meet our needs in daily life on land, in contrast, the use of smartphone underwater are so limited. Meet DIVEVOLK® Diving Assistant! It allows divers to use all phone functions underwater the same way as they do on land, therefore offers water sports enthusiasts great potential for brand new fascinating experience.

 
What is DIVEVOLK® Diving Assistant?

DIVEVOLK® wearable Diving Assistant system is based on the powerful Smartphone hardware platform, combined with self-developed software app, aiming to provide safety, communication and entertainment to divers . The system includes SeaTouchTM touchscreen underwater housing, SeaLightTM underwater strobe, SeaHearTM underwater headphone, DiveHelperTM app and divers' own Smartphone.


 Extremely Compact and Lightweight
Thanks to the innovative mechanical design, SeaTouchTM  housing’s weight is only 110 g(3.8 oz), and the whole set of Diving Assistant is less than 200 g(7 oz)! Say goodbye to heavy photography device, and only dive with fun!



 Full Touchscreen Control
Patented DiveTouchTMtechnology allows full access to all the functions of your Smartphone through touch screen operation. The profiling design enables you to use all the original buttons of your Smartphone.  Battery and overheating are no longer an issue as you can set your iPhone to standby whenever you want.

 Superior Smartphone Safety
Unlike traditional underwater housings which have big openings and long O-rings, Diving Assistant adapting the distinct EasySealTM design, consisting of a small opening, 2-point lock and 3-point fixture, is extremely safe for your smartphone. The ingenious air bag pretest system help you to check the condition of the housing every time before diving, which further guarantee the safety of your Smartphone underwater. 
 Dual LensesRear lens is equipped with anti-reflective coating to ensure the good light transmittance. A series of lens adapters are available for filters and lens option of any other brand.Built-in selfie lens is available and you can easily access whenever needed. 
 Wireless Charging Diving Assistant dose not affect smartphone's wireless charging function. Usually the humidity of dive sites is very high, and if you have an iPhone that supports wireless charging, you can easily charge your phone during diving interval, without taking the iPhone out of the housing the whole day, even if you have several dives, to avoid bring in moisture. 
 Handle and Tray Are Not MandatorySeaLightTM is maybe the world’s first underwater strobe and light that is specially designed for Smartphone housings without any handle and tray. Even new divers can handle easily.
 Synchronous FlashThe patented SyncFlashTM technology allows you to use the strobe just like a built-in unit. The unique design with elastic wires can easily release and fix the strobe. It allows a distance of up to 70 cm away from the smartphone. Synchronous flash from any angle you want in order to avoid backscatter specks, spots or blotches in underwater photos due to strobe’s light reflecting off of particles, sand or plankton.
 High Fidelity Underwater PerformanceSeaHearTM maybe is the world’s only headphone that can be connected to your smartphone underwater at a depth of up to 50 meters. Proprietary IsoAirTM technology ensures stable and high performance sound effect. Underwater voice alert to prevent improper operation and provide extra security. 
 Versatile ScenariosIPX8 Waterproof, Shockproof and Dustproof. The compact and handy design facilitates all divers and fits to various outdoor scenarios, even under extreme outdoor environments: waterproof in swimming pool, hot spring, rain and snow, dustproof in desert and thermal insulated in cold area. DIVEVOLK Diving Assistant will be your best companion in outdoor activities.  What Can Diving Assistant Do?DIVEVOLK All-in-One Diving Assistant aims to bring divers underwater safety, entertainment and communication. SafetyDiving Safety is the most important thing to divers. DIVEVOLK combine iPhone's powerful build-in functions and our special designed application software, to provide divers more protection.SPG Checking AlarmSPG checking reminder can be set from a safety perspective. It can remind you to check your SPG every 3/5/10 minutes depends on your setting value. Diving SignalDiving signals are accessible for the divers whenever needed. New divers can review them anytime even underwater. Water Surface CommunicationWith the system, you can position, text or even call on sea surface under special situation if there is a 2G/3G/4G signal, while signal is available in many dive sites. Just imaging you come out of water and find the boat is no where, it will be great if he can call the boat and send them the location. CompassiPhone Built-in compass is easy to access and work well underwater . Diving ComputerWith an optional sensor and suitable app, you can use the system as diving computer, record your diving log directly in your iPhone and share immediately. Entertainment Underwater PhotographySmartphone camera performance has been upgraded so fast that it is a good alternative to bulk underwater cameras. Full Access to all modes of the build in camera,  and DIVEVOLK camera with auto photo, manual photo, video, square, SLO-MO, panoramic, time-lapse, built in filter and much more by sliding a finger across the screen. 3rd party apps for color correction and more are convenient and powerful. Underwater MusicWe are not encourage people to listen to music while diving, the main purpose of our headphone is to hear safety reminder but do not disturb others. But if you are technical divers who need to stop for a long period, or you want to practice swimming, free diving and mermaid diving in swimming pool, underwater music will bring you a lot of fun! Music cure underwater for those people who have special needs are also helpful.    Instant Upload & ShareYou do not need to take out of the phone from housing the whole day and use it whenever you want. So convenient! Diving AppsWe think the most meaningful part of Diving Assistant is it establishes an open platform for the upcoming diving apps, which were scarce before due to the lack of hardware support, to bring divers safety, entertainment, convenience and much more. For example Fish Identification app, color restore app, diving training app, etc. Communication Human CommunicationType a message to your buddy underwater.Instructors can communicate with students by broadcast some audio message you set before diving, or you can record and show them where they can improve. Human-Machine InteractionJust like on land, make use of your smartphone functions by sliding your fingers. As technical divers, sometimes you may want to save some check list in your smartphone and work according to these steps underwater? Machine- Machine InteractionWith Bluetooth and WiFi available, It enables smartphone to be used as control terminal for other diving equipment.

<p>My name is Kendall Henderson and I am a graphic designer based in Brooklyn New York. Me and a few curious travelers spent a little over a week being blown away by everything Tokyo has to offer. We snapped way too many photos and took in as much of the vibrant culture as we could. (Which you can check out <a href=""https://medium.com/@KendallHendersn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.)</p>
<p>We spent at least one night in 5 different districts and embraced the friendly personalities of the city. For the past few years I have been undergoing a personal design project focused around the travel and exploration. I am currently working on items representing the trip to Tokyo. </p>
<p><b>Along side the many photos I have taken I would like to create a tangible piece to reference some of the common graphic and typographic visuals seen in the captivating city of Tokyo, Japan. </b></p>

<br/><b>Vision recognition technology</b> </h3><p>Before PITTA, we have developed and delivered multiple computer vision solutions to the Smart Factory and Surveillance market.</p><p>Our proprietary SVM (Smart Vision Module) is based on image tracking and deep learning to self-improve its tracking accuracy over time.</p><p>The same technology has been implemented to PITTA in order to bring technical advantages such as the following:</p><p><b>Upgradable Firmware</b></p><p>With our proprietary vision recognition technology, we will be adding deep-learning based object recognition and tracking to PITTA, which will improve the autonomous flying accuracy over time. This will happen through firmware updates throughout 2018 - we will keep working on enhancing your experience with PITTA. Stay tuned for updates on the progress.</p><p><b>Flight Control System </b></p><p>One of the most important aspects of building a drone is the flight control system it operates on. While many drone makers are outsourcing this part, we have developed our own proprietary solution in conjunction with the Vision Recognition module - meaning that we can continue on improving and developing the core functions of PITTA.</p><div>One of our biggest challenges was to connect the Flight Control Computer (FCC) and main CPU, which is in charge of vision recognition and cameras and connect it into a complete system. We are using the best middle-class CPU available which enable PITTA to capture high quality images despite its compact size, including digital image stabilization.<div>
<div> </div>
<div>Due to the compact size, Time-lapse and Slo-mo functions are available only on the action camera mode. The diverse features will be triggered according to each mode through the mobile application.<div>

It’s a complete system packed into a single device.PITTA is small (170 mm / 6.7 inches) and light (200g / 7oz) to take with you everywhere without added bulk.  Out of the box, you get a camera, drone module and an action cam module to be able to get the collection of compelling clips in different points of views.Furthermore, you can dock the PITTA onto the charging cradle to use it as a live streaming home security camera on the daily basis when you are between adventures.  Media Inquiries - Contact@pitta.co  With our modular Snap and Twist-to-Lock design, mode changes between Aerial and ground are seamless and easy.  Simply snap on the drone module magnetically and get PITTA off the ground to hover in the air. With the auto-follow mode on, you can start recording in the matter of seconds with you focusing on the experience.  DEMO - SETTING UP AUTO FOLLOWSetting up the Auto-Follow is effortless.
1. Tap the AUTO FOLLOW icon 
2. Drag & Draw a rectangle to let PITTA know what to target

3. Let the Autonomous shooting begin

 When you are ready to get down to the ground level shots, snap on the action cam module on any standard action cam mount to start recording your adventure. DEMO - ACTION CAM MODE When you are between adventures, PITTA can be turned into a Home Security (IP Wi-Fi) Camera that streams to your mobile device whenever and wherever you are. Simply dock it on to the charging cradle and power the PITTA on.  With 1-click-flying modes and Auto-follow, even the first time pilots can fly and start recording their experience without any hassle. We also provide a manual flight interface to provide flexibilities in types of shots you want to capture.  PITTA offers a design that is easy and intuitive for everyone - even for hobbyists and first time users. It's light, portable designs make it easy for PITTA to fit right into your lifestyle.    Weight and the size was the first thing we considered. Weighing under 200g (7oz) with 170mm (6.7in) of diagonal distance, PITTA is as light and portable as a smart phone that is easy to hold in one hand - which makes takeoff & landing easy even with just one hand.With the 3-pole-hole that is compatible with standard action cam mount, you can capture your adventures in handheld or mounted in action Cam mode.Portability is further enhanced with the foldable wings. Aside from saving you spaces, folding out wings when attached to the camera body will lock drone modules tightly to the camera module to prevent it from falling off. Caps covering each motor protects PITTA from environmental hazards such as light rains and dust. An ultrasonic sensor for ground detection and rubber padding on the housing prevent further water influx through the bottom of PITTA.To help users with positioning and aligning the modules, magnets are embedded in each module. The camera is capable of tilting up and down, does no protrude and is entirely covered by the protector to prevent damage. Power MonitorThe PITTA App monitors how much battery your phone has left - so that it doesn't operate when the battery level on your phone is below the minimum required to securely fly PITTA.Fully charged, the PITTA Selfie Drone operates for 15 minutes. When it is running out of battery, it will send an alarm or notification to your mobile phone to keep you updatedon the current status.No Registration Required (United States)PITTA is light and small enough to be piloted without FAA registration (No altitude restriction either). This applies to the US-market.Image Courtesy of Federal Aviation Administration   
Vision recognition technology Before PITTA, we have developed and delivered multiple computer vision solutions to the Smart Factory and Surveillance market.Our proprietary SVM (Smart Vision Module) is based on image tracking and deep learning to self-improve its tracking accuracy over time.The same technology has been implemented to PITTA in order to bring technical advantages such as the following:Upgradable FirmwareWith our proprietary vision recognition technology, we will be adding deep-learning based object recognition and tracking to PITTA, which will improve the autonomous flying accuracy over time. This will happen through firmware updates throughout 2018 - we will keep working on enhancing your experience with PITTA. Stay tuned for updates on the progress.Flight Control System One of the most important aspects of building a drone is the flight control system it operates on. While many drone makers are outsourcing this part, we have developed our own proprietary solution in conjunction with the Vision Recognition module - meaning that we can continue on improving and developing the core functions of PITTA.One of our biggest challenges was to connect the Flight Control Computer (FCC) and main CPU, which is in charge of vision recognition and cameras and connect it into a complete system. We are using the best middle-class CPU available which enable PITTA to capture high quality images despite its compact size, including digital image stabilization.
 
Due to the compact size, Time-lapse and Slo-mo functions are available only on the action camera mode. The diverse features will be triggered according to each mode through the mobile application.

If you haven’t – well, we can’t wait for you to come and visit! </p><p>Why on earth am I talking about how wonderful Savannah is? Simple.  As a special education teacher and resident of Savannah’s beautiful Historic District, I know two things:  People love (and want to visit) our town, and I am also in the unenviable position of working with families firsthand who are stretched beyond capacity. I have seen the stress that having a child with special needs can place on a marriage, other siblings and the family unit.</p><p>It is the combination of these two experiences that have led me to develop the concept behind this campaign.  Take a Break, Inc. is a vacation rental company with a difference – we utilize funds raised from patrons to <strong>provide families of children with special needs an opportunity to enjoy complimentary respite in Historic Savannah in a residence that caters to the specific and specialized needs of their family, as well as providing trained and experienced special education teachers and support staff to provide a much needed break to these families.</strong></p><p>When you contribute to this campaign, you are helping with so much more than material purchases. <strong>YOU </strong>are helping Take a Break, Inc. to lay the foundations for something that will help spread the good our world so desperately needs.  </p><p>Without your donation, our concept is just an idea (a REALLY good one, but we’re biased :)), and fulfillment will take us so much longer to achieve.  The faster we get this funded, the quicker we can begin providing amazing experiences for our patrons, while helping give families with special needs children the time together they so desperately deserve.</p><p><strong>Here’s What We Need, and Where It’s Going: </strong></p><p>Our idea is unique – there literally isn’t another program like it in Savannah (or anywhere in the Coastal Empire!) Our “Take-a-Break, Give a Break” program gives patrons with an excellent experience and the opportunity to 'give back' simply by staying in our property.  All profits go towards funding a vacation for a family in need of quality time together. Take a Break, Inc. will offer outstanding, personalized service to both revenue and not-for-profit customers, and will allow us to offer competitive pricing and an amazing vacation experience for all. This is just the first of many amazing locations and experiences for our patrons!</p><p>So, where’s the money going?  Clearly the biggest expense is going to be the purchase of the property.  And while this will be our biggest cost, it will also be our biggest asset and allow us to eventually add additional properties and locations to the Take a Break, Inc. experience!</p><p>Our goal is $686,200. It’s lofty. But as I always tell my students (and their families) if we don’t aim high, we don’t know what we’re capable of.</p><p>So, where does that crazy amount go?  Here’s the breakdown:</p><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody>

While property values are hard to predict, and we may find one for less than this, we feel this is a good place to start. We are looking for a 2-3 bedroom property (with space for a separate sensory room or area) in the Historic District, with a garden level entry for families that have children with mobility issues.

Here’s our list of priorities as far as funding goes:</p><ul style=""margin-left:80px;"">
<li>Deposit on property (20%)   </li>
<li>Costs associated with property preparation for rental</li>
<li>Purchase of equipment needed for special education students</li>
</ul><p style=""margin-left:.5in;""> </p><p><strong>Your Change Will Change Lives: </strong></p><p><strong>Take a Break, Inc. </strong>expects to enjoy a year-round demand for its property, both in terms of revenue raising customers and families benefiting from the ""Give-a-Break"" program.</p><p>Savannah is a town that people love to visit - warm weather, rich history, fantastic food, proximity to the beach (Tybee Island), festivals, markets, and many other amazing things to see and do. There is a strong demand for vacation rentals as an economical alternative to traditional hotels and the opportunity to explore all that Savannah has to offer while enjoying the comforts of a home-like environment.</p><p>A vacation rental experience that provides revenue-based customers with an excellent experience and the opportunity to 'give back' simply by staying in the property is unique to Take a Break, Inc. All profits go towards funding a vacation for a family in need of respite. This approach is highly unique, with no competition in the immediate or surrounding areas. Take a Break, Inc. will offer outstanding, personalized service to both revenue and not-for-profit customers, and will allow us to offer competitive pricing and an amazing vacation experience for all.</p><p>The idea of our organization is to help provide families with children that have specialized needs enjoy a family vacation while providing a warm, safe environment, sensory/disability support equipment, and trained and certified professionals/special education teachers to give parents a night out together. <strong>All profits will be reinvested into adding further services and perhaps even properties to our program so we may help more families in more locations. </strong></p><p><strong>Once you’re up and running, how will this work? Will you need more donations and campaigns to keep going?  </strong></p><p>If you’re like me, you’ve donated to campaigns and causes before only to find out that all of the proceeds go to operating costs and very little to the people who the organization is actually trying to help. Once our campaign amount is fulfilled, we will be a self-sustaining organization. Meaning we will operate solely on the money from folks using paying to use our vacation rental. As an all volunteer organization there are no staffing costs,  and the only overhead are the day-to-day costs of running a house. As such, we are able to use the majority of our money directly to provide activities, and accommodation to our special needs families as well as competitive pricing to those that choose to help those families by staying in our property and participating in our take a break, give a break program. The great news is, even with a generous stipend for each family, and as you will see from the table below, with your assistance we can actually utilize any profits to expand out program and help more families.

If you haven’t – well, we can’t wait for you to come and visit! Why on earth am I talking about how wonderful Savannah is? Simple.  As a special education teacher and resident of Savannah’s beautiful Historic District, I know two things:  People love (and want to visit) our town, and I am also in the unenviable position of working with families firsthand who are stretched beyond capacity. I have seen the stress that having a child with special needs can place on a marriage, other siblings and the family unit.It is the combination of these two experiences that have led me to develop the concept behind this campaign.  Take a Break, Inc. is a vacation rental company with a difference – we utilize funds raised from patrons to provide families of children with special needs an opportunity to enjoy complimentary respite in Historic Savannah in a residence that caters to the specific and specialized needs of their family, as well as providing trained and experienced special education teachers and support staff to provide a much needed break to these families.When you contribute to this campaign, you are helping with so much more than material purchases. YOU are helping Take a Break, Inc. to lay the foundations for something that will help spread the good our world so desperately needs.  Without your donation, our concept is just an idea (a REALLY good one, but we’re biased :)), and fulfillment will take us so much longer to achieve.  The faster we get this funded, the quicker we can begin providing amazing experiences for our patrons, while helping give families with special needs children the time together they so desperately deserve.Here’s What We Need, and Where It’s Going: Our idea is unique – there literally isn’t another program like it in Savannah (or anywhere in the Coastal Empire!) Our “Take-a-Break, Give a Break” program gives patrons with an excellent experience and the opportunity to 'give back' simply by staying in our property.  All profits go towards funding a vacation for a family in need of quality time together. Take a Break, Inc. will offer outstanding, personalized service to both revenue and not-for-profit customers, and will allow us to offer competitive pricing and an amazing vacation experience for all. This is just the first of many amazing locations and experiences for our patrons!So, where’s the money going?  Clearly the biggest expense is going to be the purchase of the property.  And while this will be our biggest cost, it will also be our biggest asset and allow us to eventually add additional properties and locations to the Take a Break, Inc. experience!Our goal is $686,200. It’s lofty. But as I always tell my students (and their families) if we don’t aim high, we don’t know what we’re capable of.So, where does that crazy amount go?  Here’s the breakdown:

Amount/What We’re doing with it:
Details:


$568,000 Property Location

We have met with our realtor, Chelsea Phillips (look her up, she’s AMAZING!  Chelsea was our personal realtor when we moved to Savannah, and has been voted the best in Savannah for several years in a row. While property values are hard to predict, and we may find one for less than this, we feel this is a good place to start. We are looking for a 2-3 bedroom property (with space for a separate sensory room or area) in the Historic District, with a garden level entry for families that have children with mobility issues. Please see this link for a property similar to the one we are looking at:
 
https://www.trulia.com/property/3231865322-102-W-Jones-St-Savannah-GA-31401
 
This amount includes all taxes, commissions, and closing costs.
 



$15,000 Property Furnishings
Property furnishings (furniture, linens, electronics, appliances, kitchen supplies and bathroom essentials). This is a generous estimate, and excess will be placed into the building maintenance fund for use and replacement as needed.


$25,000 Sensory Equipment, specialist and Mobility Support for Special Education Families 
This amount includes the purchase and installation of changing tables, sensory support equipment (e.g. swings, rocking balls, soft play equipment, weighted blankets, and seating supports etc…


$0 Salaries. 
Take a Break, Inc. is all volunteer, so no salaries will be paid. We get paid by helping others. That’s it.  


$4,000 Insurance Costs 
Liability, flood, home, and disaster insurance for the first year (we will be using our personal insurance agent, Sam Sharpe of State Farm). This is an estimated cost. 


$1200 Website Setup
Professional website building and hosting for the first two years.


$3000 Marketing 
This will be applied towards marketing on social media platforms.


$5000 Building Maintenance Fund 
This fund will cover any structural concerns that arise, termite bonds and other such concerns.


$5000 Legal Costs 
This amount will be used to prepare any legal documents, such as contracts for revenue-raising customers and agreements for “Give a Break” program recipients. We will be using Brannen, Searcy, and Smith LLP for this process. We have had excellent experiences with this firm in the past. 


$62,000 Indiegogo Platform Fee
This fee may be waived if we can get our 501 (3) (c) status approved prior to funding completed. It has been filed, we are waiting on completion.

 These amounts are estimates only, but are based on extensive research and discussions with appropriate experts and businesses.So, What are we going to do with the funds from this campaign if we don’t reach our goal? That’s easy. We’re going to apply for grants and reach out to local businesses for donation of time and services until we get there, but that will take time and that will mean that there will be families who don’t get the opportunityThis IS going to happen, but how quickly we are able to begin helping others depends on how soon we can get this campaign/project funded.That said, if we don’t get the funds we’re looking for, we aren’t going to let that stop us. Here’s our list of priorities as far as funding goes:
Deposit on property (20%)   
Costs associated with property preparation for rental
Purchase of equipment needed for special education students
 Your Change Will Change Lives: Take a Break, Inc. expects to enjoy a year-round demand for its property, both in terms of revenue raising customers and families benefiting from the ""Give-a-Break"" program.Savannah is a town that people love to visit - warm weather, rich history, fantastic food, proximity to the beach (Tybee Island), festivals, markets, and many other amazing things to see and do. There is a strong demand for vacation rentals as an economical alternative to traditional hotels and the opportunity to explore all that Savannah has to offer while enjoying the comforts of a home-like environment.A vacation rental experience that provides revenue-based customers with an excellent experience and the opportunity to 'give back' simply by staying in the property is unique to Take a Break, Inc. All profits go towards funding a vacation for a family in need of respite. This approach is highly unique, with no competition in the immediate or surrounding areas. Take a Break, Inc. will offer outstanding, personalized service to both revenue and not-for-profit customers, and will allow us to offer competitive pricing and an amazing vacation experience for all.The idea of our organization is to help provide families with children that have specialized needs enjoy a family vacation while providing a warm, safe environment, sensory/disability support equipment, and trained and certified professionals/special education teachers to give parents a night out together. All profits will be reinvested into adding further services and perhaps even properties to our program so we may help more families in more locations. Once you’re up and running, how will this work? Will you need more donations and campaigns to keep going?  If you’re like me, you’ve donated to campaigns and causes before only to find out that all of the proceeds go to operating costs and very little to the people who the organization is actually trying to help. Once our campaign amount is fulfilled, we will be a self-sustaining organization. Meaning we will operate solely on the money from folks using paying to use our vacation rental. As an all volunteer organization there are no staffing costs,  and the only overhead are the day-to-day costs of running a house. As such, we are able to use the majority of our money directly to provide activities, and accommodation to our special needs families as well as competitive pricing to those that choose to help those families by staying in our property and participating in our take a break, give a break program. The great news is, even with a generous stipend for each family, and as you will see from the table below, with your assistance we can actually utilize any profits to expand out program and help more families. This is just the beginning!

A metal named for its extreme properties after the Titans of Greek mythology.  Stronger and lighter than steel, and corrosion resistant on top of that.  Asking myself this question made me realize how easy it is for a designer to lose feeling with the materials of the objects we design. I mostly design on the computer these days; a virtual space in which I can cut bars of steel in half with a few mouse clicks. The realization that  the only way to truly answer the question is by experiencing it, led to this project. I decided to create a small titanium object, without the use of computers. Just me, my hands and my tools.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459887509/ipad_motion_brighter_tidashi_ks_upenl9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/> <div>
<h1>Kiridashi </h1>
<p>For inspiration I studied the ancient Japanese culture of knife and sword making. The Tidashi design is based on the Kiridashi-Kogatana: a traditional Japanese utility knife. It is an elegant and deceptively simple design, with its relatively long handle and short cutting edge. In Japan this tool is still relied upon for making accurate cuts or markings on wood.  The Tidashi is a small tool, but its design allows you to exert excellent control over its cutting tip, accurately executing everyday cutting tasks. I find it especially suited for opening boxes, because the short blade design prevents you from penetrating the box too deeply and damaging its content.</p>

<div>
<h1>Tungsten Carbide</h1>
<p>Another Japanese knife making technique applied in the Tidashi knife is the fusion of different metals in a single knife, bringing out the best properties of each. Titanium is an extremely tough material and in my exploration of its toughness I have ruined many a saw. However, tough is not the same as hard. A cutting edge needs to be hard, and among the hardest metals known to man is tungsten. I therefore fused a thin layer of this extremely hard metal to the cutting edge of the Tidashi. The result is a knife with the toughness and lightness of Titanium, but with the hardness of tungsten carbide precisely where needed.  The tungsten carbide is only embedded on one side of the blade. The reason for this is a principle often applied in self sharpening knives: as the relatively softer titanium wears away through normal use, the thin and sharp edge of the tungsten carbide is exposed more, creating a fresh cutting edge. <br/></p>

<h1>Heat Anodizing </h1>
<p>Another unusual and rather magical property of titanium is that it naturally develops a hard wearing layer of titanium oxide. By skillfully applying heat, this natural process can be exaggerated and the layer of oxide can be grown to greater thicknesses. The thickness of the layer affects the way light  is reflected of the knife, resulting in an amazing array of colors. A consistent thickness is hard to achieve, and so far I have managed to master creating an even gold colored layer. I personally like the rainbow variation of this anodized coating for its unpredictability (it fits the dogma of the project of relinquishing absolute control over the design).</p>

<h1>Variations </h1>
<p>The Tidashi comes in a few variations. The brushed version shows the titanium in its raw and grey appearance, as some people know it. This version has a tough and utilitarian look to it.  The polished version is perhaps the most neutral looking. The high polish gives a clean and crisp look to the knife. The polished gold colored version is very classy looking, and in my opinion this variation of the knife could almost pass as a piece of jewelry. The polished rainbow colored version is the most playful of them all. The coloring is slightly unpredictable and differs from knife to knife. The result is a one of a kind finish on each knife, reflecting the spirit of the project and the fact that each knife is hand made by me.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459887704/vier_tidashi_ks_h5mbi5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1>Around your neck or on your keychain</h1>
<p>One of the strengths of a good tool has very little to do with the tool itself. A good tool is only useful when you have it with you when you need it. I specifically created the Tidashi to be of a diminutive size, so that you can carry it with you at all times. I also designed a system which allows you to either carry it as a highly functional necklace, or less noticeably as a keychain. The sheath of the knife itself is made of a heat stable silicone material, which means that the knife should not accidently slide out when, for example, left in the sun. It comes in either white or black, to best match your choice of finish on the knife. The cord to which the sheath is attached (and which can be easily replaced by the supplied key ring) is made of a resilient Paracord, able to resist a pulling force of 95 lbs. It comes in various colors to compliment the different finishes of the knives, and the colors of the sheaths. <br/></p>

<h1>Handcrafted in America </h1>
<p>I expected this project to help me understand what the properties of such a tough material as titanium really feel like when handled. I hoped it would make me more aware of material properties in general and thus make me a more aware and better designer. I can now say that it certainly has fulfilled those expectations, but something else has come from it. Something I had not given much thought before. This project taught me what it means to put love and pride into crafting something by hand. In making these knives I experienced the sensation of transferring more that the knife itself to its future owner. I truly believe that knowing how, where and by whom your Tidashi is made will give you at least some of the pride and satisfaction I felt when creating it. <br/></p>

Whenever you touch SOFF Blanket, it will make you feel better and want to wrap yourself up in it. We wanted to make soft and warm blanket without using animal fur. Durability- INVARIABLE SOFT AND WARMis the part that we put the most efforts while we produce the blanket.There are many microfiber products on the market already, but it is difficult to find products like SOFF. Most of microfiber blankets become not fluffy after many uses or after washing or have bunch of lints that came after washing. We decided to make samples of improved durability and lint-Free blanket by using Korean best quality fabrics directly from the material that we produced. We believed that the quality of the product will be different when the fabric is different. That was how SOFF blanket was born.There is a reason. The secret lies in the use of the BEST quality fabric specially made in Korea. SOFF Blanket can't be compared to other low quality fabric. SOFF is a brand made by a company that produces the BEST textiles in Korea and exports it to the world. We have been supplying high quality textiles to famous brands overseas.Our Philosophy is to make blankets with high quality materials.Softness that only SOFF can implement, the secret is in the Draw Textured Yarn. The yarn is made by joining the fine yarns of 192 strands and it is the basis of soft and light SOFF fabric.   Draw Textured Yarn is made of fine yarn that is 100 times thinner than the hair.Tricot Knitting Method which produces strong durability and high quality goods. This is why SOFF blanket has a soft and long lasting durability. We develop and make luxurious SOFF Blankets at our OWN Headquarters and factory. That's why SOFF can produce and manufacture great quality products at reasonable prices.  SOFF creates minimalist objects that make our lives better and more convenient. Established in 1989, our company has been in the textile business for two generations. Busan, South Korea. June 1989SOFF blanket was created out of a deep understanding and knowledge of good raw materials. We are constantly researching and developing new materials. SOFF is proud of our high quality products made from the BEST materials.SOFF can produce great quality products at affordable prices because we manufacture our own materials. We make our own fabric from high grade fibers so we can give you the BEST quality and the BEST price. SOFF blankets are made in our own factories.

<li>
<strong>Chemical Hand Warmers?</strong> Awesome. My body has turned to ice, but at least my palms are sweating!  Besides, single use chemical warmers? They hit the trash and poison our planet, no thanks. </li>

<strong>Heat up water in my Nalgene?</strong> Listen, I'm the only one that should be needing to take a leak here. Waking up soaked because my bottle decided to tinkle? That's a bit counterproductive to the mission here. (this has actually happened to me, not cool. COLD, yes. but way not cool)</li>
<li>
<strong>Do jumping jacks, push-ups, run in place?</strong> What is this? 24 Hour Fitness?! 2am is for restful, restorative sleep, NOT getting swole.</li>
<li>
<strong>What Else?</strong> Rekindle the fire, heat up a rock, snuggle a bear, crawl into the wolves den?!!Maybe! People get desperate when they're cold!  I don't know about you, but I make it a habit to avoid 3rd degree burns (or animal maulings) in the wild. </li>

</div></div></div>","Does this sound familiar? Your evening meal still warm in your belly, the campfire now turned to red smoldering ashes. You fall asleep with a peaceful smile on your face, just to awaken suddenly at 2am by the shivering cold. You become restless, your teeth begin chattering, and you just can't get warm!You’re miserable, freezing, rolling in and out of pitiful sleep knowing this is going to be a long, dreadful night. There are options for getting warm. But so few of them actually include SLEEP. And isn’t that what you came here to do? Now, imagine the same scenario. Only this time when you wake up cold at 2am, you simply drift right back off to sleep in a warm and toasty slumber, because instant warmth is at your fingertips by just the push of a button.In the past, our options for warming up in the wild have been limited (to say the least)...

Chemical Hand Warmers? Awesome. My body has turned to ice, but at least my palms are sweating!  Besides, single use chemical warmers? They hit the trash and poison our planet, no thanks. 

Heat up water in my Nalgene? Listen, I'm the only one that should be needing to take a leak here. Waking up soaked because my bottle decided to tinkle? That's a bit counterproductive to the mission here. (this has actually happened to me, not cool. COLD, yes. but way not cool)

Do jumping jacks, push-ups, run in place? What is this? 24 Hour Fitness?! 2am is for restful, restorative sleep, NOT getting swole.

What Else? Rekindle the fire, heat up a rock, snuggle a bear, crawl into the wolves den?!!Maybe! People get desperate when they're cold!  I don't know about you, but I make it a habit to avoid 3rd degree burns (or animal maulings) in the wild. 
..And the list of heat-producing methods goes on and on and on. Most of which do NOT actually involve sleeping through the night.After more cold, sleepless nights in the wild than I care to admit, I vowed to fix this problem with a reliable, sustainable, and modern solution that does not require disrupting your cozy sleeping quarters in search of warmth.and so... the Hot Pocket was born! Interview with Dawson Wheeler, the founder of Rock/Creek",19.0,1,"2 Campaigns

Purposely designed for international travelers, aid workers, and field researchers, this tent is designed to help you sleep safer and better throughout your journeys.        From urban hotels, to rural guesthouses, to remote field locations, the self-standing mosquito net converts to a robust outdoor 3-season outdoor tent providing a protective and strong physical barrier between you and any disease-carrying insects in the air, ground or mattress you are sleeping on. 

 
Packs small Being small means the Bwindi Field tent is easy to take with you wherever your travels take you. Don't fuss with mosquito nets that need to be hung or oversized mosquito pop-up tents that need to be checked in as their own piece of luggage. Modular - take only what you need  Only the poles and the tent are required for the indoor mosquito tent. To get full 3-season protection outdoors, bring along the fly-sheet,  ground-sheet, and stakes which are all included with your Bwindi Field Tent. Access zippers to 2 pockets in all 4 corners  All 4 corners of the Bwindi Field Tent have access zippers that access 2 pockets each.  You can charge anything you need from any of the 4 corners and feel confident in knowing that the pocket itself acts as a back-up layer of mesh protection to the zipper opening. 18 inside pockets22 inside attachment loops1 roof shelf  You didn't read that wrong - make yourself at home, and you can stop sleeping on your stuff!The Bwindi Field Tent has 9 pockets on each end of the tent (=18 total)  that also create a double-wall of mesh around the lower part of each end of the tent. Our stronger materials mean the pockets can actually hold things (watch, eyeglasses, notebooks, phone, radio, lights, etc.) without the tent walls sagging down on you.The roof shelf hangs in the middle of the roof but you can use any of the loops to connect it at whichever angle you prefer wherever you prefer.  There are 22 internal loops for hanging gear, installing internal guy lines for increased stability, and for attaching a sleeping sheet across the floor. Precision design and construction     Available in 4 colors Our color lineup is inspired by feedback from specific users. Whether you want to be discreet or be highly visible, we provide a color palette that offers functional options for what you need. Fits in your favorite carry-on Our custom length poles are custom sized to be under 40 cm to easily fit into most multi-day carry-on bags and suitcases.  Thoughtfully designed quality packing bags for each of the tent components allow you to take what you need and leave what you don't.  The stuff sacks/bags are slightly larger than needed so it's super easy to stuff your tent, fly, and groundsheet into them and then form the stuff sacks into whatever shape fits your bag best.    Field.Work is bringing back the tradition of the field tent. We wanted to make a tent that met the following criteria:
designed for international travel
made to be lived in for multiple weeks at a time
made of proven materials and simple components that could be repaired in the field with needle and thread and/or duct tape
    Tent - features summary Flysheet - features summary Technical specifications  Materials   Instructional videos    The Bwindi Field Tent is 100% insecticide free and relies on its high-quality materials and design to keep you safer at night by providing a 360-degree physical barrier around you while you sleep.  While will we can not guarantee that insects won't get in your tent if the doors or zippers are left open or if they hitch a ride on you, as you enter the tent, our field tests show that once you are inside and all zipped-up that you'll be protected from any insects outside. To be 100% sure that that you won't be bitten do not sleep against the mesh walls of the tent - we have the sized the Bwindi Field tent slightly wider than the average 1-person tent to better accommodate this.Apply a permethrin treatment if you wishIt is your call if you want to use a permethrin mosquito spray on your Bwindi Field Tent. Permethrin is an insecticide that kills mosquitoes and other small insects on contact. It is readily available in stores (and online) and permethrin-treated mosquito nets are currently recommended by the World Health Organization for protection against mosquitoes. We would caution that recent studies are indicating the potential for a linkage between permethrin and effects on human health. This is the reason why we left the choice up to you as to what you are comfortable with by keeping the Bwindi Field Tent 100% insecticide free.If you choose to use permethrin, consumer available permethrin sprays should not hurt your Bwindi Field Tent as long as you follow the application instructions they provide. Treat the Bwindi Field Tent with the spray as it advises to treat any other piece of material or clothing.DEET based mosquito repellant can have a chemical reaction with both the waterproof coating and/or the polyester material that the Bwindi Field Tent is made of so we DO NOT recommend getting any DEET based product on your tent.     THE SUPER PERK:The Bwindi Expedition  OUR SUPER PERK IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY!Field.Work is super excited to partner with the amazing and experienced adventure travel company Rock My Adventure to offer a once in a lifetime trip to Bwindi and beyond. This expedition aims to explore my favorite city in Africa before heading west to Lake Kivu where we will prepare to trek to the top of  Mount Nyiragongo within Virunga National Park and sleep on the crater rim. Then we will head into the rain forests of Bwindi Impenetrable Forest in search of the critically endangered mountain gorillas. We'll be guided by the park's dedicated rangers who protect the mountain gorillas and leaving a number of Bwindi Field Tents as a donation to support their efforts. After Bwindi, we head into the misty Rwenzori mountains (from the Ugandan side), also known as the 'mountains of the moon' and one of the sources of the Nile river where we'll do a three-day trek before decompressing at Lake Bunyoni.The expedition will have optional mini-training events throughout on topics such as travel safety, security, and photography. THE PLAN

IMPORTANT NOTESPlease note that this itinerary acts as a framework plan. This is an expedition, and the leadership team may need to be adaptive to frictions encountered en route. Should events in the region dictate that this itinerary is no longer possible at any point prior to departure or during the expedition and alternative, modifications will be made to ensure the safest options will be substituted. This expedition is designed to be achievable by people with an active and healthy lifestyle and no previous experience is necessary to join. However, it is arduous at points and will test you. You will be sore, tired, wet, and possibly hungry. It is your responsibility to prepare physically and mentally for the expedition and be ready for living in basic conditions. Please don't hesitate to contact us - and we recommend that you do - if you have any questions at contact@field.work More information is available online and a pre-expedition guidebook will soon be available.  An application form is necessary to complete prior to confirmation of your participation (if for any reason you do not meet the physical/health/other requirements for the trip, you will be refunded all but the price of your Bwindi Field Tent).  A health, safety, and security waiver will also be required to be signed prior to participating in the expedition.  It's our first time crowdfunding a product, which means it's also our first time here on Indiegogo! If it's your first time backing a crowdfunding campaign we've put this together to help put all the information you need in one place regarding the get-your-perk-process: New to Indiegogo?Here is how it works:

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>My name is Paul, and I am one of those people who enjoy learning.  Being able to see, taste, &amp; touch all elements around me is just one of the small parts of taking in knowledge &amp; experience.  It's nearly an obsession, in fact.  If I could afford to do so, I would be a professional student - a person who learns for a living! Observation is key to this, for I usually find items that most people may walk right past.</p>
<p>Last year, I decided that it's about time I find my way to some place extremely suiting to my needs - New York City!  This trip is tentatively planned for this coming April, and I am looking for any assistance to make this dream come true.</p>

Hello there!
My name is Paul, and I am one of those people who enjoy learning.  Being able to see, taste, & touch all elements around me is just one of the small parts of taking in knowledge & experience.  It's nearly an obsession, in fact.  If I could afford to do so, I would be a professional student - a person who learns for a living! Observation is key to this, for I usually find items that most people may walk right past.
Last year, I decided that it's about time I find my way to some place extremely suiting to my needs - New York City!  This trip is tentatively planned for this coming April, and I am looking for any assistance to make this dream come true.

Details
* I am looking for a total of around $1000.  This would cover the travel, lodging, food, and entertainment for a 4-day period to tour over NYC.
* In return of any generous donation, there are tiered rewards provided, to be collected from this trip.

The Reason Why
I'm looking for this to happen, simply because I have never gone there. I'm a small-town guy who's just not as excited to his surroundings as before. I've seen and heard about so much of NYC that I feel its time I taste it for myself. 
Also, I love documentation. I will certainly be taking photographs and short videos on this trip, to share and provide to others what I've seen & learned.
I'm not entirely penniless, by the way. I do have a job, and I get by paycheck to paycheck. I'm 28 years old, and I just want to see the world more than just the county I live in. I promise you this endeavor will not be a wasteful one. Please take a look at the perks to see more details for what your contribution can award you.

We'll be partnering with CrowdOx for the backer survey management so that you can easily keep track of your pledge. Once again, a big thank you for supporting CORI SuperTee!Introducing CORI SuperTee Our lives are dynamic. We go from indoors to outdoors, from lunch to afternoon coffee breaks, from long meetings to quick gym sessions, and from road trips to big vacations. Things spill, we sweat, and sh** happens.That’s why we created the SuperTee. We needed a t-shirt that could handle it all, and that looks good while doing it. 
 
 From breakfast to the boardroom and to an afternoon jog, the CORI SuperTee has got you covered. All of its features make for a uniquely comfortable T-shirt that you can wear literally anywhere. It's also what makes the SuperTee perfect for travel. It stays fresh as you transition from the airport to the airplane, to the cab and straight to exploring. 
 
 

 
  

  

  

  

  

  
 
 
  
*Upgrade from short sleeve to a long-sleeve by adding S$14 per shirt (approximately $10USD)* A CrowdOx survey will be sent where you can select your size, color and manage your upgrade to long sleeves.  This isn’t just a great t-shirt coated in useful treatments. It’s a sophisticated shirt made of quality all-natural fabrics that care for your skin and keep you cool, dry and odor-free.Nothing gets washed off, so it feels like the first wear every time. 
 
Timothy Jacob Jensen is one of Denmark’s most awarded designers.

Our marine collagen is extracted from upcycling methods and we source our fabrics from sustainably managed and renewable sources to ensure minimum wastage and maximum utility in every SuperTee. Our factories are WRAP certified to ensure fair wages, reasonable hours and proper working conditions- making for safe, lawful, humane and ethical manufacturing. 
 We’re a group of designers, travelers and explorers that work with proven manufacturing partners who have been delivering quality products for more than 45 years. Our mission is to create the best d*mn travel products for travelers and bring fun and function back to travel accessories.After our last successful Kickstarter campaign, The World’s Happiest Travel Pillow, we decided to take on another key-travel-item: the T-shirt.Every day looks different, and we needed a T-shirt that could offer some consistency.

To measure, simply place your favorite t-shirt on a flat surface and measure across the Shoulder, Chest (below armpit) and Length to see which of the above sizes matches.

The LoftTek Adventure Jacket gives you the best of everything, combining the warmth and performance of a synthetic jacket with the lightness and packability of a down jacket!
  Do you find yourself jumping between your down jacket and your synthetic jacket? Why should you have to choose between a bulky warm jacket and a light versatile jacket. The Outdoor Vitals LoftTek™ Adventure jacket solves this problem. We’ve designed it to be light, warm, versatile, and durable for your all your adventures.We didn’t hold back on any features. We didn’t design it to hit a price point for a shelf in a store, but rather to be the most versatile ultralight jacket out there. Most jackets don’t have all of  the features we do. If they did, they would be $200 - $300 jackets. This jacket has all the features you need without the heavy price tag.LoftTek™ is the world's most advanced synthetic down imitation. The loose fill nature of the fibers mimics down’s extreme weight to warmth ratios and packability, while the it’s synthetic nature allows it to stay warm in wet conditions!Unlike down, LoftTek uses siliconized fibers that dry quickly and always stay lofted for optimal warmth - even when wet.You get the ultralight warmth and packability of down and the versatility and moisture advantages of synthetic. The LoftTek™ Adventure Jacket is the perfect adventure jacket because it doesn’t require much packing space. The best part is, you can pack the entire jacket into its own pocket. Use it when you need and and pack it into itself when you don’t. Because of it’s ultra soft material, your packed jacket can also second as a pillow. Another way to save space without compromising your comfort.Never worry again about the rain catching up to you. Our LoftTek™ Adventure Jacket is coated so that water will bead up and roll off rather than absorb into the fabric.The LoftTek™ Adventure Jacket is fully weatherproof and can stand up to the harshest  conditions including snow, rain, cold temperatures, and extreme wind without sacrificing warmth or performance.To give you most heat and stabilization - the baffle design minimizes sewing lines, also known as cold spots, while still keeping the insulation in place and stable.Because our jackets aren’t technically a down jacket, we don’t need the extra down proof coating. This makes the material more breathable for those active journey days.Zip up the jacket and feel the hood hug your neck. Now you can keep the unwanted air out and stay comfortable.For added warmth and protection, we made sure to insulate the entire hood.For better head movement, our hoods have two different elastic cord adjustments. This allows you to cinch the hood around your face as well as keep the hood tight to the back of your head. No more turning your head and having the hood stay facing forward.If you find yourself storing too much warmth, use the underarm zippers to release some of the heat. These are especially useful during high activity. The thumbholes in the sleeve ends allow the sleeves to stay fully extended and in place, even when layering up or being active. Avoid shivers up your arms - especially during super active use. You can also put gloves on in order to really make sure your hands are nice and warm.If thumbholes and gloves aren’t enough, dip your hands into your pockets. Carefully designed, the pocket sits behind the insulation of the jacket allowing your hands to stay toasty and protected.Make sure you don’t lose any of your valuables while on your epic adventure.The insulation dries extremely quickly so if you need to wash it in a hostel or hotel sink, it can air dry fast and be ready to go the next day.We believe that some of our best trips are one where we can live in the adventure. During our best adventures we feel prepared and comfortable, which allows us to live in the moment. We designed the The Outdoor Vitals LoftTek™ Adventure Jacket to give you everything you need without holding you back wherever you are. Whether your adventure is bar hopping in the city with your friends, or hiking in Yosemite, you need a jacket that can do it all, so that you can too! And we believe that with the LoftTek™ Adventure Jacket you can.  This pillow is your saving grace in the backcountry! The stretch nylon material stretches and moves with your head providing a more comfortable night sleep without feeling like your sleeping on a rock for a pillow! The stretch nylon material also feels like a pillowcase to your skin that breathes and feels natural.Often times as backpackers we use lumpy clothes as a pillow and wonder why we don't sleep well. Well, with the Outdoor Vitals stretch pillow, you'll never consider leaving this little. 2.6 oz luxury comfort pillow behind!
 


 

A few years ago our founder Tayson started Outdoor Vitals to help outdoor enthusiasts to “Live Ultralight” through use of premium ultralight products that cut down on waste. We believe Living Ultralight means using premium gear that works in any weather, and is easy to pack and won’t slow you down. It means buying less quantity to fill up our earth’s landfills and buying more quality products that are ready for all your adventures.He knew that premium gear was inherently lighter, lasted longer and provided better outdoor experiences, however the price of the gear was out of reach for him and his family. He wanted outdoor adventurers to spend less on gear and more on experiences so Outdoor Vitals sell direct to consumers online to save you 40-50% off of retail store prices. He also feels very fortunate while others around the world have not been as fortunate, so Outdoor Vitals donates 1% of revenues to sustainable poverty projects around the world. The Outdoor Vitals team is now focused on becoming the next generation outdoor brand to rival the retail giants. Join with us and start Living Ultralight today!When we started, we only had $500 to put into the company - and we never took venture capital. We determined that a family owned company is better at creating value for customers. While the company has grown to be a 9 figure brand, it's still extremely vital to our growth that we use crowdfunding platforms to help us compete with investment company owned or venture capital backed outdoor brands. We believe that focusing on long term value for our customers is more important than reporting to investors about how to maximize the next months profits.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For sailboats of all sizes and ages, mobile apps are making advanced navigation functions easy and accessible.  The <a href=""http://www.SailTimerApp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SailTimer charting app</a> (below right) provides a quick and easy display of your optimal tacks and Tacking Time to Destination (TTD ®).  Unfortunately, apps are difficult to navigate with if you can’t see the screen out on the water where the sun is bright and reflecting.  Wearing sunglasses makes it even worse.  And if you turn up the screen brightness, your tablet/phone runs out of battery power and gets warmer.  </p>
<p>All sailors need wind information, so that’s why SailTimer Inc. started making the first-ever masthead anemometer that could transmit to tablets and smartphones back in 2012.  The newest 5th-generation <a href=""http://www.SailTimerWind.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SailTimer Wind Instrument™</a> is shown below (left).   The SailTimer charting app uses wireless wind data and tacking distances to calculate your optimal tacks.  But there is no sense displaying a wind gauge or your optimal tacks if you can’t see the screen.  It is time to set a new standard for sailboat navigation, with Audio Tacking.  No more squinting at screens out in the sun. </p>
<p>This is quick and easy, so you can sail the boat.  Keeps your hands free.  No more screen;  the app just tells you the boat speed, tacking results and wind conditions in pre-set intervals.  That could be anytime conditions change more than a certain amount, or just when you tap the screen.  Amazingly simple.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511140671/yppw97x6mrh4hjdkfgfs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would like to make an Android charting app for the SailTimer tacking results, and build to the next generation audio interface (for both Android and iOS), but we need your help.  You’ll be able to use the SailTimer tacking results in a free SailTimer charting app on iOS and now on Android too.  And as a backer, you’ll get discounts on the new Audio Tacking for Android or iOS and on the wireless Wind Instrument.</p>
<p>We already used a voice interface in the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sailtimer.WindGauge"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SailTimer Wind Gauge app</a> on Android (above center).  Now we are ready to go to the next level, with full navigation and optimal tacks on Android.  We need funds (flexible amount) to build a brand-new free app on Android with the SailTimer tacking results overlaid on Google Maps and aerial photos worldwide.  That will allow you to see waypoints and tacking results on Android.  But on both iOS and this new Android version, Audio Tacking will now be available.  </p>
<p>Perks:  Audio Tacking is an ongoing service where you'll be getting free updates with these AI functions continuing to evolve. As a backer, you can get Audio Tacking at increasing discounts depending on whether you get a 1-year, 3-year or lifetime subscription.  We expect it to be available in the SailTimer charting apps on iOS and Android by March 2018.  As sailors ourselves, we know that the tacking results work best with live wind data coming in to your tablet/smartphone.  So the perks also include an option to get the wireless, solar-powered SailTimer Wind Instrument™ at a discount with Audio Tacking.  The Wind Instrument is already in stock, so will ship to you immediately. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511142355/eudjozityfakjyx3piei.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Audio Changes Everything</h3>
<p>HOW IT WORKS:  You can put your screen to sleep to save power and reduce heat, and put the tablet someplace safe so you don’t have to worry about it.  Keep your hands free for sailing.  Very simple;  if you want to hear Audio Tacking at any time, just tap on the screen (even if it is off).   You can also ask for automatic updates if wind and GPS conditions change a certain amount.  Like Alexa, Siri and OK Google, but also very practical for navigating. </p>
<p>Simple and easy:</p>
<p>1. Connect tablet/phone to wireless SailTimer Wind Instrument on Bluetooth.</p>
<p>2. Enter waypoint with a tap (or paste in a list).</p>
<p>3. That’s it;  optimal tacks update automatically.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT YOU HEAR:  <i>“Wind speed 7.8 knots.  Boat speed 4.2 knots.  Heading 192 degrees.  Bearing starboard 17 degrees would save 1 hour 12 minutes.”</i></p>
<p>This is a simple message.  But it is actually very sophisticated data.  </p>
<p>You can set how much of a change you want before an audio notification.  You can also choose if you want to hear:  Apparent/True wind, heading, wind angle/direction, TTD, tacking distance, bearing of optimal tack, and how long until the next tack (time and/or distance).</p>
<p>This is a totally different approach.  GPS chartplotters are waterproof and can be seen out on the water, but they are expensive and don’t provide your optimal tacks and Tacking Time to Destination (TTD®).  A lot more people have marine navigation apps, but those are hard to see.  Problem solved.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511183659/xhpxobvhgfihz74wprpu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This even works great on small boats, where there are no instrument displays or 12-volt battery.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Out of all of the GPS chartplotters and apps out there, the <a href=""http://www.SailTimerApp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SailTimer app</a> is the only product that uses tacking distance to determine optimal tacks and Tacking Time to Destination (TTD®).  It was the first app with polar plot learning, and set a new standard for sailboat navigation with a different approach than the ETA and VMG on most GPS chartplotters.  Our goal will be to move the same functions from the highly-respected SailTimer app on iOS into an Android version.  And then to add Audio Tacking to both.</p>
<p>The wireless, solar-powered <a href=""http://www.SailTimerWind.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SailTimer Wind Instrument™</a> is in stock now for delivery to you.  We will provide access codes for the subscriptions when Audio Tacking is available.  There is little technical risk involved, since we have been using the patented SailTimer tacking results for over 10 years.  The innovative SailTimer products have been covered in pretty much all of the sailing media over the years, as shown in the examples below.  We also already have the tacking results in the widely-respected SailTimer app on iOS, and the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sailtimer.WindGauge"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SailTimer Wind Gauge app</a> on Android already has some audio capabilities. </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need your help to cover the costs of making an Android app to overlay the SailTimer tacking results on maps, and to build the Audio Tacking for iOS and Android.  This is a whole new approach to navigating out in the sun with wireless devices and mobile apps.  You’ll still need marine charts in unfamiliar waters.  But now you can simply hear key navigation information like wind angle, wind speed, boat speed and optimal tacks.  Keep your hands free, with no squinting at a tablet/smartphone out in the sun.  No more screen at all.</p>
<p>Please spread the word.  Backing this project also lets us know about customer interest in this innovative new audio interface. </p>
<p>All sailors need good wind and tacking information, at low cost, without a screen that is hard to see outside.  Help us fix this problem.</p>

All sailors need wind information, so that’s why SailTimer Inc. started making the first-ever masthead anemometer that could transmit to tablets and smartphones back in 2012.  The newest 5th-generation SailTimer Wind Instrument™ is shown below (left).   The SailTimer charting app uses wireless wind data and tacking distances to calculate your optimal tacks.  But there is no sense displaying a wind gauge or your optimal tacks if you can’t see the screen.  It is time to set a new standard for sailboat navigation, with Audio Tacking.  No more squinting at screens out in the sun. 
This is quick and easy, so you can sail the boat.  Keeps your hands free.  No more screen;  the app just tells you the boat speed, tacking results and wind conditions in pre-set intervals.  That could be anytime conditions change more than a certain amount, or just when you tap the screen.  Amazingly simple.

 

What We Need & What You Get
We would like to make an Android charting app for the SailTimer tacking results, and build to the next generation audio interface (for both Android and iOS), but we need your help.  You’ll be able to use the SailTimer tacking results in a free SailTimer charting app on iOS and now on Android too.  And as a backer, you’ll get discounts on the new Audio Tacking for Android or iOS and on the wireless Wind Instrument.
We already used a voice interface in the SailTimer Wind Gauge app on Android (above center).  Now we are ready to go to the next level, with full navigation and optimal tacks on Android.  We need funds (flexible amount) to build a brand-new free app on Android with the SailTimer tacking results overlaid on Google Maps and aerial photos worldwide.  That will allow you to see waypoints and tacking results on Android.  But on both iOS and this new Android version, Audio Tacking will now be available.  
Perks:  Audio Tacking is an ongoing service where you'll be getting free updates with these AI functions continuing to evolve. As a backer, you can get Audio Tacking at increasing discounts depending on whether you get a 1-year, 3-year or lifetime subscription.  We expect it to be available in the SailTimer charting apps on iOS and Android by March 2018.  As sailors ourselves, we know that the tacking results work best with live wind data coming in to your tablet/smartphone.  So the perks also include an option to get the wireless, solar-powered SailTimer Wind Instrument™ at a discount with Audio Tacking.  The Wind Instrument is already in stock, so will ship to you immediately. 

 

Audio Changes Everything
HOW IT WORKS:  You can put your screen to sleep to save power and reduce heat, and put the tablet someplace safe so you don’t have to worry about it.  Keep your hands free for sailing.  Very simple;  if you want to hear Audio Tacking at any time, just tap on the screen (even if it is off).   You can also ask for automatic updates if wind and GPS conditions change a certain amount.  Like Alexa, Siri and OK Google, but also very practical for navigating. 
Simple and easy:
1. Connect tablet/phone to wireless SailTimer Wind Instrument on Bluetooth.
2. Enter waypoint with a tap (or paste in a list).
3. That’s it;  optimal tacks update automatically.
 
WHAT YOU HEAR:  “Wind speed 7.8 knots.  Boat speed 4.2 knots.  Heading 192 degrees.  Bearing starboard 17 degrees would save 1 hour 12 minutes.”
This is a simple message.  But it is actually very sophisticated data.  
You can set how much of a change you want before an audio notification.  You can also choose if you want to hear:  Apparent/True wind, heading, wind angle/direction, TTD, tacking distance, bearing of optimal tack, and how long until the next tack (time and/or distance).
This is a totally different approach.  GPS chartplotters are waterproof and can be seen out on the water, but they are expensive and don’t provide your optimal tacks and Tacking Time to Destination (TTD®).  A lot more people have marine navigation apps, but those are hard to see.  Problem solved.

This even works great on small boats, where there are no instrument displays or 12-volt battery.
 

Risks & Challenges
Out of all of the GPS chartplotters and apps out there, the SailTimer app is the only product that uses tacking distance to determine optimal tacks and Tacking Time to Destination (TTD®).  It was the first app with polar plot learning, and set a new standard for sailboat navigation with a different approach than the ETA and VMG on most GPS chartplotters.  Our goal will be to move the same functions from the highly-respected SailTimer app on iOS into an Android version.  And then to add Audio Tacking to both.
The wireless, solar-powered SailTimer Wind Instrument™ is in stock now for delivery to you.  We will provide access codes for the subscriptions when Audio Tacking is available.  There is little technical risk involved, since we have been using the patented SailTimer tacking results for over 10 years.  The innovative SailTimer products have been covered in pretty much all of the sailing media over the years, as shown in the examples below.  We also already have the tacking results in the widely-respected SailTimer app on iOS, and the SailTimer Wind Gauge app on Android already has some audio capabilities. 
 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
We need your help to cover the costs of making an Android app to overlay the SailTimer tacking results on maps, and to build the Audio Tacking for iOS and Android.  This is a whole new approach to navigating out in the sun with wireless devices and mobile apps.  You’ll still need marine charts in unfamiliar waters.  But now you can simply hear key navigation information like wind angle, wind speed, boat speed and optimal tacks.  Keep your hands free, with no squinting at a tablet/smartphone out in the sun.  No more screen at all.
Please spread the word.  Backing this project also lets us know about customer interest in this innovative new audio interface. 
All sailors need good wind and tacking information, at low cost, without a screen that is hard to see outside.  Help us fix this problem.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Product development &amp; design process</h3>
<p>Back in June we traveled to Asia to investergate a number of raw material manufacturers and eyewear factories. After a dozen visits we chose our factory based on physical working conditions, quality of current production, known brands in production and delivery times. Together with the factory and raw material manufacturers we had a number of prototypes produced in different designs and functionalities from which we chose the current design/model and sat specific quality requirements according to the FDA and CE mark standards, as well as our own. Working on the lense we reviewed several options, both in terms of design and functionality regarding ventilation and lens changing system. We chose the most clean design where you change the lens by bending back the top and bottom of the frame. According to our lens manufacturer the 6 vents on the lense have an optimal shape, size and placement to prevent fog which is why these are generic. In addition to this the prototyping process included selection of: specific lens type incl. coating inside and outside, quality of foam and number of layers, strap design and quality incl. specific silicon lines and positioning of these for optimal anti-slip, design of hard case and microfiber pouches. In addition to this for every product we sell, we secure the clean-up of 10kg of plastic waste in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>This project is all about bringing high quality, great looking googles to the market at very affordable prices and at the same time honoring our 1=10 program by donating a significant part of the revenue to the NGO ProArtso. Our ambition is to gain market shares from the existing market leaders that are selling products with an immense gap between the cost and the consumer price. We therefore believe we are benefitting both end-consumers and the environment. On November 4th we travelled back to China to follow the production and made sure everything is on track.</p>
