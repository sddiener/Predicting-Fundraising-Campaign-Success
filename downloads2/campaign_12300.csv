<p>Growing up watching a good amount of Japanese animated television shows in the 80s and 90s, I have always been fascinated by existential and philosophical stories with science-fiction elements. Lab 99 started off as a 20-year collective personal journey, and it has now turned into something much more than passion. It’s an enlightenment of what humanity is about and anyone can relate. My goal is to show the audience how to appreciate and embrace what we are while understanding our differences and choices we make towards changes and transformations.</p>

<p>I've always been a fan of mystery and science fiction from an early age, especially stories with philosophical and social commentary elements to them such as the Twilight Zone. What drew me to Lab 99 was the concept of an alien coming to Earth with incredibly advanced technology and the ability to cure all of our diseases, and the idea of what that would really mean for the human race and how we would really react. I'm also a big fan of movies with a witty and quirky sense of humor, especially when combined with science fiction such as The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, and that's another thing that drew me to Lab 99.</p>

<p>Born to a Malawian family, I was introduced to art at a young age through animation, comic books, video games and film. Anime, surreal art, and music have always been a driving force in my work. I hold a BFA in life drawing at the American Academy of Art. Technical training in traditional drawing skills from the Academy led me to find interests in professional illustration, graphic design, photography, and fine art which I am heavily influenced by, to create a variety of visually striking imagery. I have been involved in many artist exhibitions around Chicago, including showcases outside such as The Society of Illustrators in New York and the Congressional Art Exhibition and Digital Arts Showcase in South Korea.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We began Lab 99 the comic book with a preview issue (available for free as a digital copy on our <a href=""http://www.nebulacreatives.com/lab-99"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>) setting up the world and introducing the main characters. Our goal from here is to continue to create rich and engaging content accompanied by high quality artwork, drawing you further into the world and story of the Lab 99 alien named Eddie, as he struggles to cope with the increasingly dangerous set of circumstances surrounding him. </p>
<p>In particular, this campaign is to raise funds for the second issue, picking up right where the first left off. We are currently offering both digital and printed copies of the first and second issues, with many more rewards to come.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a small independent group of artists, our choice to go with a crowdfunding site such as indiegogo was based on 1) having a direct line of communication with our fans, where we can share our ideas and inspiration, and 2) having a way we can sell our work directly to you, and deliver it in as efficient and fast a way as possible. </p>
<p>By contributing and purchasing a copy of Lab 99, you are helping to support independent artists in doing what they love, and helping to make this series as good as it can be for many more issues to come. We sincerely hope you will enjoy what we have in store for you. And we can't wait to show you what's coming in the next issue. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although this is our first comic book, our company Nebula Creatives has been around for several years and has successfully produced a wide range of videos and projects, including a yearly film festival we run in Chicago.</p>

<p>In the event that we do not raise enough money to produce the issue, we are happy to return anyone's money who no longer wishes to support the project. Our primary goal is to produce quality art and storytelling for our fans, and we do not wish to take your money without delivering you what we promised. </p>

</div><p>Hello, Errbody! </p><p>I have a kick-ass proposal for the sequel to the movie <i>Sisters</i>.  In it, I will be their Half Sister and this campaign is to help me fund the venture of producing and pitching a short film to be reviewed by Amy Poehler and Tina Fey.    </p><p>How did this happen you ask?  Well, keep reading!<br/><br/>For years, I have been told I am a cross between Amy Poehler and Tina Fey. Being a well-trained actor who loves comedic roles, that is the best compliment I could ever receive!  I would rather be told that than told I look like Giselle. ;) <br/><br/>Earlier this year, I decided it was time for me to create my own opportunity as an Actor. Gone are the days of waiting around for a call from my agent - at my age, I don't have time to climb the Actor's ladder to success, rung by rung. Besides, that is sooooooo not my style!  </p><p>I am the girl who comes in from the right and shocks everyone!  So, I decided to take inspired action and come up with a way to create my OWN success! Oprah is going to love this story :)  Yes, I just put that out there!  Oprah,  I am coming for you!  Ellen, don't think you got away.  I am coming for you too!  </p><p>Ok,  focus Stephanie,<br/><br/></p><p>So, back in January, I saw the movie Sisters and realized that I do truly look and act like both of them, and I am the perfect ""Half Sister"" for a sequel.  It was like I was hit on the head with a coconut. I knew then and there that this idea was precious, and I promised to honor it.  <br/><br/>At first, I aimed small, thinking I will produce a little web-series and grab a following in hopes of Amy and Tina discovering me.  Yeah.  That made the Universe laugh.  Way too small of a goal...  <br/><br/>However, in March, I gave a motivational speech in NYC about taking big leaps (video below) and from that speech, I met contacts directly related to both Amy and Tina.  I have been asked to produce a short film that will be presented to them as a proposal.  I know ... how flippin amazing!  I am beyond excited!  </p><p>Watch this video to learn more about my story and my style. It is the speech that set my dream on a course for becoming a reality. </p><div>  </div><div>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F18cb01VZR6M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D18cb01VZR6M%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F18cb01VZR6M%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>
</div><div>
<br/>
</div><p></p><div>
<div>As a result, I am packing the good ole bags and hightailing it up to NYC to make this happen!  I am raising money to make it all happen. Not only are you investing in my project, you are investing in me and I promise to not let you down!<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I understand there is a risk.  And the rewards presented in this campaign are not guaranteed.  I JUST HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE CERTAIN OF SOMETHING IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  I WILL HAVE THIS MOVIE DEAL NAILED DOWN BY SEPT 1st.  I can feel it in my bones.  </span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>This film will be presented to Amy and Tina, and will also be submitted to various film festivals all over the United States as a way of gaining further exposure.  <br/><br/>There is no plan B.  This is it, folks!  My big move.  Like the part at the end of Dirty Dancing when he lifts her up!  No backing down.  I am 100% committed to this project.<br/><br/>I have learned something rather valuable from my new friend Kristin Gracie. She says, ""I believe the power of the individual lies in the strength of their community.”  So here's to you, my community, thank you for helping me make my big dream a reality! <br/><br/>If you believe in me and my project, any little bit will help!  I thank you from the bottom of my soul.  </p>
<p>If you are not able to contribute, getting the word out would be so helpful to me!  </p>
<p>Thank you again for visiting my campaign.  </p>

Being a well-trained actor who loves comedic roles, that is the best compliment I could ever receive!  I would rather be told that than told I look like Giselle. ;) Earlier this year, I decided it was time for me to create my own opportunity as an Actor. Gone are the days of waiting around for a call from my agent - at my age, I don't have time to climb the Actor's ladder to success, rung by rung. Besides, that is sooooooo not my style!  I am the girl who comes in from the right and shocks everyone!  So, I decided to take inspired action and come up with a way to create my OWN success! Oprah is going to love this story :)  Yes, I just put that out there!  Oprah,  I am coming for you!  Ellen, don't think you got away.  I am coming for you too!  Ok,  focus Stephanie,So, back in January, I saw the movie Sisters and realized that I do truly look and act like both of them, and I am the perfect ""Half Sister"" for a sequel.  It was like I was hit on the head with a coconut. I knew then and there that this idea was precious, and I promised to honor it.  At first, I aimed small, thinking I will produce a little web-series and grab a following in hopes of Amy and Tina discovering me.  Yeah.  That made the Universe laugh.  Way too small of a goal...  However, in March, I gave a motivational speech in NYC about taking big leaps (video below) and from that speech, I met contacts directly related to both Amy and Tina.  I have been asked to produce a short film that will be presented to them as a proposal.  I know ... how flippin amazing!  I am beyond excited!  Watch this video to learn more about my story and my style. It is the speech that set my dream on a course for becoming a reality.   




As a result, I am packing the good ole bags and hightailing it up to NYC to make this happen!  I am raising money to make it all happen. Not only are you investing in my project, you are investing in me and I promise to not let you down!

I understand there is a risk.  And the rewards presented in this campaign are not guaranteed.  I JUST HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE CERTAIN OF SOMETHING IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  I WILL HAVE THIS MOVIE DEAL NAILED DOWN BY SEPT 1st.  I can feel it in my bones.  



This film will be presented to Amy and Tina, and will also be submitted to various film festivals all over the United States as a way of gaining further exposure.  There is no plan B.  This is it, folks!  My big move.  Like the part at the end of Dirty Dancing when he lifts her up!  No backing down.  I am 100% committed to this project.I have learned something rather valuable from my new friend Kristin Gracie. She says, ""I believe the power of the individual lies in the strength of their community.”  So here's to you, my community, thank you for helping me make my big dream a reality! If you believe in me and my project, any little bit will help!  I thank you from the bottom of my soul.  
If you are not able to contribute, getting the word out would be so helpful to me!  
Thank you again for visiting my campaign.  





Love and light,
Stephanie  Wilson

<p><strong>You Get:</strong> A selection of awesome rewards.

SummaryI'm Lander Solon. I'm a student of architectural engineering and interior design at the University of Wyoming, and I also write. I've obsessively written fiction all my life, and my current writing project is a 300-page graphic novel called A Death of Anonymity. I'm writing and illustrating a page per day, and will be finished by the end of this year.
A Death of Anonymity is a dark and labyrinthine story that explores existentialism, politics, ethics, and 
epistemology from the perspective of thinkers like Heraclitus, Epicurus, Emerson, and Nietzsche.

 I focus on story showing rather than story telling; this combined with a visual style abstractly related to Art Noir film and Japanese Edo period woodblock printing leads to a degree of artistic integrity rarely present in mainstream fiction. Contributing to this campaign will allow the addition of a new member of the ""pantheon"" of serious graphic novels.
    Budget
The illustration and self-publication of my 300-page graphic novel will cost $9325.

From about 100 international bidders, the winning quote for quality illustrations came in at $7500. this includes four iterations of illustration and renderings to ensure the novel looks exactly as I intend.
Page Layout services from self-publishing companies come to $300.
A quote from a quality literary editor I trust came to $525.
Though most copies of A Death of Anonymity will be printed on-demand with sales, I budgeted for $1000 for 100 copies to pitch to comic book stores on a book tour in 2016.

I'm a comedian and clown (not the scary kind).  I've written a clown show about the dangers and difficulties of depression and I would love to take it to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this year. My show is about an actor backstage of a back alley vaudeville show, navigating the crippling battle between his depression and his obsession with making people laugh.  While struggling to decide whether or not to take his newly prescribed medication, he decides instead to take his own life.  However, as he attempts to do so, his clown persona takes him over.  The clown carries out the suicide attempt on his behalf, and by failing as clowns do at everything, the clown saves his life.  Fifty percent of all profits the show makes at the Edinburgh Fringe will be donated to Depression Alliance.  This show is dedicated to my hero, Robin Williams.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The goal of 4,000 dollars will be used to offset the costs of staging and marketing the show.  The more effectively I can market the show, the more people will be drawn to see it, and the larger the donation to Depression Alliance will be.</span></p>

<h3>Vampire Mob Issue 3</h3>
<p>I believe this is the greatest time in the history of storytelling. Hi! I'm Joe Wilson, the creator of Vampire Mob, a dark comedy about a hitman whose mother-in-law moves in for eternity. This story and these characters have been a part of my life since I started writing VMob in 2009. </p>
<p>After making the live-action series released in 2010 and 2011 I wrote a script for the next part of the story that was twice as long as the first two parts combined. Unfortunately, in 2013 we lost cast member Marcia Wallace before we could shoot that script. </p>
<p>Instead of recasting or writing her character out of the live-action series, I chose to keep her character ""alive"" in another story form, a graphic novel. Thanks to the support of over four hundred cool people, Issue 1 was created, followed by Vampire Mob Issue 2. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Issue three picks up the story exactly where Issue 2 ended, with Don in a dark alley banging on a metal garage door. The next part of the story is really fun, with lots of action thanks to the Irish mob hiring Don to do some ""consulting.""</span></p>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I'm <strong>Sunitha Tati</strong>, and as many of you know, I've been in the entertainment industry for over two decades. During that time, I've had the privilege of working on some of the most exciting projects in the industry. Everyone has his own battles, I battled with mine, not once but twice in the form of cancer at a young age. It is Ayurveda that helped me fight it with all the might and thus I decided to open the pandora box of knowledge for you. A humble creation that would not have been possible without Dr. Marisa Laursen(Author, Doctor of Ayurveda and Lead Faculty at the California College of Ayurveda) &amp; Vamsi Bandaru(Illustrator, Director at Guru Publishing). I'm also grateful to Guru Publishing &amp; Ayurway for helping make my dreams a reality.</p>

<p><b><i><br/>Vagrant X</i></b><i> is about a
journalist, from Bangkok, specializing in stories unlike any others, who was
contacted by one of his readers who has one unique story to tell. The story is
about this child who grew up in a well, without knowing why. He never left this
jail. At first, he thought that this was normal, that every living being lived
like that. But the more time passed, the more he understood that he was the
only one living like this.<br/><br/>
Later, we will discover that this child is the result of an experience (a
failed one?), and he is able to use 100% of his brain capacity, which also
allows him to get his subconscious awake in a special way.</i></p>
<p><i>This special way will depends on the books he
has read when he was imprisoned in the well. Basically, he takes his power from
books and from his subconscious.</i></p>
<i>Where it gets interesting is that we discover later
that there was not a single well but dozens more! So we will see other
characters with different abilities according to the books they have read and
which are stored in their subconscious. These characters will meet in the great
adventure that awaits them!<br/><br/></i><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454917865/zi1lvbcjpnmcwcjw4mwb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Dinner is on the table.' <br/><br/>This is our introduction to the characters who make up the Sick B*stards within the story; a tale of survival, incest and cannibalism based on extreme horror author Matt Shaw's number one best-selling novel of the same name.<br/>
</div> <div> <p>Dave and Matt met purely by chance. Matt Shaw was standing in the queue of MCM Telford, bored, when he got chatting to Dave - who was also waiting in the queue, patiently waiting for the doors to open so they could set up for another convention.

<p><br/></p>
<p>Dave warned Matt comics weren't cheap but Matt shrugged it off and said it needed to be done. As it turned out, Dave wasn't lying but - luckily for Matt - agreed to take on half the costs and organise the illustrator and letterer for the series (because, let's be honest, Matt wouldn't have a clue where to start).

THIS CAMPAIGN IS CANCELED AS OF 3/3/2015, PLEASE DO NOT DONATE.
Short Summary In blackly humorous comic series Transhuman Resources, we follow the misadventures of UNIS:
 a transhuman, transgender and transnational corporate troubleshooter in
 a world where they've branded people-trafficking, fought wars over 
breakfast cereal, and founded time-travel temping agencies. 
Packed with utterly gratuitous sex and indefensible amounts of violence, Transhuman Resources is definitely not for the easily offended. 
We are Wood Ingham and K. Guillory. Howard ""Wood"" Ingham (writer,
 Swansea, UK) is a writer, editor, and performance poet. He contributed 
to over forty books for White Wolf and Onyx Path's World of Darkness RPG
 lines (some of which have won awards) and his clients have ranged from 
charitable and religious organisations through to the British Government
 (but he can't tell you more about that because he'd have to kill you). 
He has most recently been published in Parthian books' Gothic fiction 
anthology A Flock of Shadows and in The Ghastling magazine. io9.com once described his self-published roleplaying game MSG™ as ""Stuffed to the gills with black, black humor"". @HowtheWoodMovesK. Guillory (artist, Detroit, USA) is a controversial author, painter, graphic designer and comic publisher. She is part of Ashur Collective, with whom she has published four previous books, including Blood Money: the Road to Detroit. @kgpaintsPast books K.

<h4>Hello everybody! </h4>
<p>My name is Mark Berger, and we are Digital Dogma studio (<a href=""http://ddogma.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/comics-messenger-heroapp/edit/www.ddogma.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/comics-messenger-heroapp/edit/www.ddogma.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/comics-messenger-heroapp/edit/#www.ddogma.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ddogma.com</a>). <br/>Everything started in a toyshop, when I decided to try an Iron Man mask on. At that moment, I realized that there was a place for a superhero in every adult man’s heart! Unfortunately, I am not a film star and my name is not Robert Downey Jr., so there is nothing I can do to star as the Iron Man in the next series of this fantastic action film. Then I thought, why not create a messenger, where people could communicate on behalf of their favorite superheroes?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430926248/hrtakvoidnnegb4gmrqi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I am a founder and director of the Digital Dogma studio, which I founded in 2010. We had been working in the sphere of mobile apps and Internet web-site production and had gathered a great team composed of highly professional specialists, programmers, designers and illustrators. The next morning I invited the whole team to a conference room for a meeting and told everyone about my idea to create this hero-themed messenger. First, silence reigned in the room. But I saw that their eyes were illuminated with the sparkle of interest and desire to bring this idea to life no matter what. At that very moment I understood that we would get there by all means. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431348521/xeflygoonicljqisuboz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We started working on this app straight away and things moved fast because we are so passionate about this project. Full of enthusiasm, we made many things in a spontaneous manner, changing the name of the app every other week until we agreed for HeroApp. True, it really sounded more like WhatsApp and this was not accidental. The idea was to create a name which somehow recalled that of WhatsApp, so that people could easily both recognize it and memorize. And, yeah, we wanted to spark interest in our competitors as well. :) </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430927531/ldkd6a9jzzouf3hgwxm8.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have been working on this app for 7 months. Now there is a completely functional prototype ready to be fully tested. We were so deeply involved in the process of the messenger creation that we didn’t even notice how time flew by and morning turned into night, winter turned into spring. We forgot about everything else including other projects, our families, wives, friends and investors! And all of a sudden we realized we had run out of money.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1430927578/e39hpwdzwbp1d3vnt872.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>No support from you means no heroic messenger, simple as that. Help us now and we will help you in return. We will make your childhood dream come true and you will learn how it feels to be a superhero! </p>
<p>We need 500 thousand dollars to finish the messenger and launch it in the AppStore. If we are able to raise this sum of money by September 2015, iPhone and Android device owners will be able to download HepoApp. </p>

<h3>EYRIE Magazine #1 Premiere Issue Launch</h3>
<p>I'm a well-known Comics &amp; Fantasy artist with decades of experience in creating and self-publishing. There are no Horror magazines currently on the market like the one I'd like to create, which is not just a copy of what's come before but features stories that are timely and relevant today. Launching the first issue successfully will enable us to continue publishing on a bi-monthly basis.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Print Run</h3>
<p>To properly print this B&amp;W magazine we need to purchase a minimum number of copies in advance, for EYRIE it will start at 500 copies. To reach our printing goal, we're offering multiple perks to supporters, like copies ""signed in blood"" by publisher Von Hoffman, Buttons, Stickers, T-Shirts, Retailer packages and Original Art. If our goal is not reached the print run will be less, resulting in a higher per-copy cost to us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Horror stories have historically followed the fears and concerns of the populace, and these stories are unique in that they reflect many current contemporary social issues, and will continue on this trajectory in future issues also. We believe the Magazine will be successful based on our past publishing experience, the question is simply ""how much?""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are no risks or challenges on producing this first issue, as all the content is ready for publication. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>And we always appreciate any kind of support like sharing this project with friends and on social media!  Indiegogo also has great share tools.</p>

If our goal is not reached the print run will be less, resulting in a higher per-copy cost to us.

The Impact
Horror stories have historically followed the fears and concerns of the populace, and these stories are unique in that they reflect many current contemporary social issues, and will continue on this trajectory in future issues also. We believe the Magazine will be successful based on our past publishing experience, the question is simply ""how much?""

Risks & Challenges
There are no risks or challenges on producing this first issue, as all the content is ready for publication.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey guys! my name is Ayo Makinde  and I am the creator of the African fantasy  comic;Njeri-The Telesaic Code, I was born in Ibadan, Oyo  State, South Western region  of Nigeria. Growing  up as a child, my love for fantasy  budded with the phenomenal works  of  C.S. Lewis' Chronicles  of Narnia and the Tolkien fantasy  masterpiece- The Lord of the Rings Triology. The world of covert operation  captured my heart when I started reading the works of the master  of intrigue- Robert Ludlum.  Big thank you to my elder brother  who  introduced me to his  works. Since then I  have  dreamt  of creating  a work that  blended  these two  genres  so perfectly  within the African context. My passion for  comics in general lead me to create the comic brand-comicsDI.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE JOURNEY INTO NJERI</p>
<p>Five  years  ago the journey  into Njeri  started, I spent countless  nights  writing pages upon  pages of the  script while developing  the concept for the character  development at the same  time. In  2016,  I took a giant  step to release a preamble  to the  graphic novel. A  fifteen page colourful comic titled: Njeri  (Illumination). You can  read the preamble  on  my  website- <a href=""http://www.comicsdi.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.comicsdi.com</a></p>
<p>SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>An  evil personality rises from the sands of history, obsessed with a feat which has, to a large extent, only been achieved by  Alexander the Great  of old,  he seeks to conquer the  known  world using a continent which through the ages has been known as the dark continent as  his sceptre-Africa!.... but why Africa???</p>
<p>In  an alternate realm known  only as  Revotta, a prophecy known as the prophecy of  the 12 thrones has finally been released after thousands  of years. This might be the end of lord bazael, the evil and psychopathic  sorcerer, god of the  Anktalians. The prophecy  is an herald  of  a redemption  long awaited. Forces will  clash, the heavens will bleed, the realms will quake as the  tussle for Revotta thunders.</p>
<p>Caught in  the ticket  of these two realms are two personalities with completely divergent traits: one is a female fast rising Kenyan R&amp;B Singer-Njeri, while the other is the exceptionally brilliant &amp; calculating Hausa born detective-Farouk Garba, a graduate of  criminology  from Arizona State University, U.S.A.</p>
<p>Together, the duo find themselves unexpectedly teaming  up to solve a larger than life puzzle  which might be the  curse of the human  race or  its redemption.</p>
<p>Njeri inspires with deep seated  themes of courage, leadership, scarifice, self-discovery and  redemption.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MY MISSION</p>
<p>My  mission in writing  Njeri-The Telesaic  Code is  to  birth a work that  creates  a  perfect blend between  the world  of covert  operation and the enchanted world of fantasy within  the African context. I want to  set  another  record  in  the world of fantasy. </p>
<p>I started the Indiegogo Campaign because it suddenly dawned on me that   a work  that has  the potential to set another  world record in the fantasy genre  was simply gathering dust and rusting away  on my shelve. I  was robbing  the world of another great work....'cos after  the preamble to the  work, which had  barely scratched  the surface  of the story,  the work dragged  on with endless  delay, part  of the  key  factors  being   inadequate  financial  backing .</p>
<p>So, friends, family, fantasy fans all over the world, I humbly ask for your help in making this dream  come true by guaranteeing  that this  Pan-African Fantasy  tale comes  to  reality. Let's make  history  together.</p>

<p><strong>Walk Through A Wonderland of Imagination With Us</strong></p>
<p>Johnny Wu (aka @sgtbananas) has turned a passion for toys and photography into an immersive and fantastical adventure that changes dreary reality into a world where all of your childhood fantasies can come true.  Through these images we can visit a world where Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles can fight Storm Troopers and Transformers can walk alongside Spider-Man.  The only limit to what we can encounter is our own imagination.  Johnny's photography provides a window to the wonder we experienced as children when the toys which occupied our worlds weren't just plastic collectibles, but vehicles to unleash the unending imagination of youth.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504027931/bevfv9hdwiobpuvuzekj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Armed with his favorite toys, a passion for photography, and a highspeed camera, Johnny has turned his interest in making life-like scenes with action figures into a brand on Instagram.  Anyone following his @sgtbananas  feed will find the most amazing images turning the mundane into something truly remarkable.  It is the combination of his sense of photography and a vibrant imagination that come together to make his visions a reality.</p>
<p>“I’ve been a toy collector my whole life,” says Johnny Wu. “I’ve always had a strong connection to toys, but it wasn’t until I started taking photos of them that I felt that I was able to share how special they are. Ten Frames Per Second is my lifelong love of toys and photography coming to life. I never stopped being a kid, and I hope that my photos reach the inner kid in all of us.” </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504028210/mmljoveriyznjbprr9kx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With your help here, we are putting together an exclusive edition hard cover art book featuring some of Johnny's amazing toy photography called 10 Frames Per Second: An Articulated Adventure.  This book is an amazing 224 page tome that gives us a peek directly into our collective childhood with johnny's incredible vision for his toys.  Using full size common place locations and props, Johnny has blended the real and surreal into a vibrant representation of imagination.  It is easy to look at these photographs and get lost in the content to the point that you don't realize they are just toys. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504028702/coatphtbr86upkgg6772.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There's such a genuine playfulness in every photograph that captures the whimsy we used to feel as kids.  Johnny's photography takes you out of the humdrum of your daily life and reminds you what it is like to see things through the eyes of a child.  Remember back to when you would play with action figures and anything was possible.  Chewbacca could ride a skateboard and Mario could jump on the backs of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  These are the things that Johnny captures with amazing clarity and simple joy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504029231/wd8ghrub2jws2xkcu2kn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are asking Johnny's fans and anyone who remembers what it was like to see toys through the eyes of a child to please consider supporting this project.  The 10 Frames Per Second: An Articulated Adventure Art Book is a fantastic journey into the imagination that we know will resonate with you.  The chapters are full of heartfelt and imaginative photography that will make you smile.  Seeing these toys posed and shot with the juxtaposition of real and full size backgrounds makes the imagination come alive and you can't help get caught up in the emotion they elicit.  Johnny delivers insights on the photos and sets he uses to bring you into the actual photo shoot and allow you to understand the how and why behind the props being used.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504029376/etohlj13hkhrsn9bhgza.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

Johnny Wu (aka @sgtbananas) has turned a passion for toys and photography into an immersive and fantastical adventure that changes dreary reality into a world where all of your childhood fantasies can come true.  Through these images we can visit a world where Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles can fight Storm Troopers and Transformers can walk alongside Spider-Man.  The only limit to what we can encounter is our own imagination.  Johnny's photography provides a window to the wonder we experienced as children when the toys which occupied our worlds weren't just plastic collectibles, but vehicles to unleash the unending imagination of youth.  

Armed with his favorite toys, a passion for photography, and a highspeed camera, Johnny has turned his interest in making life-like scenes with action figures into a brand on Instagram.  Anyone following his @sgtbananas  feed will find the most amazing images turning the mundane into something truly remarkable.  It is the combination of his sense of photography and a vibrant imagination that come together to make his visions a reality.
“I’ve been a toy collector my whole life,” says Johnny Wu. “I’ve always had a strong connection to toys, but it wasn’t until I started taking photos of them that I felt that I was able to share how special they are. Ten Frames Per Second is my lifelong love of toys and photography coming to life. I never stopped being a kid, and I hope that my photos reach the inner kid in all of us.” 

With your help here, we are putting together an exclusive edition hard cover art book featuring some of Johnny's amazing toy photography called 10 Frames Per Second: An Articulated Adventure.  This book is an amazing 224 page tome that gives us a peek directly into our collective childhood with johnny's incredible vision for his toys.  Using full size common place locations and props, Johnny has blended the real and surreal into a vibrant representation of imagination.  It is easy to look at these photographs and get lost in the content to the point that you don't realize they are just toys. 

There's such a genuine playfulness in every photograph that captures the whimsy we used to feel as kids.  Johnny's photography takes you out of the humdrum of your daily life and reminds you what it is like to see things through the eyes of a child.  Remember back to when you would play with action figures and anything was possible.  Chewbacca could ride a skateboard and Mario could jump on the backs of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.  These are the things that Johnny captures with amazing clarity and simple joy.

We are asking Johnny's fans and anyone who remembers what it was like to see toys through the eyes of a child to please consider supporting this project.  The 10 Frames Per Second: An Articulated Adventure Art Book is a fantastic journey into the imagination that we know will resonate with you.  The chapters are full of heartfelt and imaginative photography that will make you smile.  Seeing these toys posed and shot with the juxtaposition of real and full size backgrounds makes the imagination come alive and you can't help get caught up in the emotion they elicit.  Johnny delivers insights on the photos and sets he uses to bring you into the actual photo shoot and allow you to understand the how and why behind the props being used.  

This is the first collection of Johnny's work and will take you on a visual tour of pop culture toys.  The tableaus created are refreshing, inspiring, and energetic.  With each page you will marvel at the breadth of figures and imagination being presented for us to collectively enjoy.  This book is a source of joy that can be pulled off your bookshelf and shared with anyone to spark conversation and nostalgia.  

10 Frames Per Second; An Articulated Adventure is currently being worked on by Johnny Wu.  He has shifted through thousands of photographs to find his favorites that represent a wide range of classic toys.  We're hoping that all of Johnny's fans who follow him on Instagram at @Sgtbananas will take this opportunity to be a part of bringing those beautiful images to a new audience.  We are dedicated to making this a one-of-a-kind book that will be a go-to reference for starting conversations and sharing a little piece of childhood with friends.

 GUNS, NUNS & DEMONS...OH HELL!  6 ISSUE SERIES ABOUT A BOUNTY HUNTER AND A NUN WHO HUNT DEMONS IN A BATTLE FOR THE SOULS OF MANKIND.
Written, Penciled, and Lettered by: Glaister ""SILVERBACK"" Ormsby.
Inked & Colored by: Leigh Walls.
Creative Consultant: Devante Sanchez.
 This campaign is to fund the printing and unveiling of Issue no. 1 of my comic series ""HELL & HOLY WATER"". Contributions will go towards the funding of a lifetime dream to put out my own comic book under my company SILVERBACK Comics. 
  What is Hell & Holy Water?
What makes this comic so unique?

It's an epic tale where there are ""ABSOLUTELY NO POWERS!"" That's right our protagonist Jason (The Bounty Hunter) has no special abilities just 2 fists, 10 knuckles and a whole lot of bullets to go along with a nasty ass temperament.  Now his unlikely partner Bella (The Nun) is a whole different kind of nun who kicks ass then prays for forgiveness. Her weapon of choice... Holy water bullets!
The duo face corruption in the church, Demons. and each other as they put their differences in faith and personal beliefs aside to save mankind form total annihilation and assimilation from the underworld.
It starts in Hells Gate, Arizona but the reach of evil goes global in the book...

        ""GRAB YOUR ROSARY AND YOUR GUNS AND ENJOY THE RIDE INTO DARKNESS...SOMETIMES IT'S HELL TRYING TO GET TO HEAVEN!""   What We Are Asking For & What You Get Back

    The Impact of Hell & Holy Water
 The Many Faces of H&HW:  This project is multi- faceted:

It is an opportunity to work with my 13 year old son Devante, and show him that in life it is OK to dream and to love and live for your passion.
""HELL & HOLY WATER"" has inspired something in my son that I didn't know was present.  He is more vocal about what goes into this story and his creativity has no boundaries.
 As a fan of Comics for over 30 years I can now not only share that with my son but i can also let him in on the creative side of it and introduce a new generation to the world of comics. ""HELL & HOLY WATER"" started out from my love for Johnny Cash and Clint Eastwood Westerns like ""2 Mules for Sister Sara"".  The dynamic of a bad ass and a nun captured me right off the bat and lead me down the path I am on with my 2 main characters Jason (The Bounty Hunter) and Bella (The Nun).  Their tale much like my journey is both unique and mind blowing.  I want to share ""HELL & HOLY WATER""with the masses. and with all of you.  Thank You!

<p>I'm Zanna, i'm a martial artist, journalist and the writer of the comic book series critics describe as <i>""Like watching a Shaw Brothers' movie""</i>, <i>""<i>""Simply stunning""</i></i>, <i>""Reminiscent of Miller-era Daredevil""</i>, with a script that is<i> ""Bitingly sharp and will appeal to Garth Ennis fans""</i>, with <i>""Tarantino-esque dialogue""</i>. </p>
<p>This isn't your ordinary 'kung fu' comic. This is written by someone who has experienced<i> the real deal</i> and has studied these esoteric arts with masters from around the world for over a decade. It tells the true(ish!) story of a young girl in 18th-century China who prays to the spirit of the White Crane to help her take revenge on her enemies – and create one of the world's greatest martial arts in the process – leaving a legacy that may save the world... or destroy it! </p>
<p>But after finally finding a great art team and publisher (<a href=""www.markosia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Markosia Enterprises</a>) and funding the 92-page <i>Volume 1</i> (below) myself, I know from experience that it could take years to get the funds in place to finish the story and complete <i>Volume 2</i>, and I don't want readers to have to wait  to see the epic conclusion. </p>

And that's why I need your help. 




INSPIRATION
I'm a huge comic book fan and have studied the Chinese internal martial arts for years (you know, the cool ones based on building chi that give you super powers, not the 'hard' muscle-based ones from Shaolin ;-) ) and I wanted to see them represented in comics by someone who knows them first hand. 
And this beautiful revenge fable, which has inspired so many to take up the arts, seemed like the perfect foil to do that (and somewhere along the way it turned into an epic fantasy adventure!). 
You can learn more about the arts and mythos behind the project in the bonus section of my website www.thewhitecranecomic.com (and check out the 6-page opening scene of the first issue too).

<h3>Hi Everyone!</h3>
<p>I’m Brian Lue Sang. I’m a husband to a beautiful, supportive woman, and a father to three incredible, fun, and lovely little monsters. But, I’m here because of my love to <i>create</i>! For the second time, I’ve made a comic book (yup, bonafide <i>indie comic</i> guy - bags under the eyes and all) and to say that I would appreciate your help making it a reality is a grand understatement! </p>
<p><strong>Godlore: Whispered Truths &amp; Lost Lullabies</strong> is really a collection of stories created to help flesh out this grand, reimagined world. Did I mention that the <strong><i>book is complete</i></strong>? Yup, nothing left to do with this volume other than formatting a few extra pages of character pinups from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.joecatapanoart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joe Catapano</a>, artist for the upcoming Star Circuit</li>

</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>It may go without saying but, this means a lot to me because... this is <i>my</i> own book. <i>My</i> writing, <i>my</i> art, <i>my</i> lettering. But with that, it’s also <i>my</i> weaknesses, <i>my</i> inconsistencies, and <i>my</i> fears (as a writer, artist, and a person). So why do it? Art has long been my “vice”. It’s the thing I need to do to feel calm, or whole, or just get lost in. In doing my own book, I can focus that feeling into something tangible. Something that’s mine. And maybe in that, it can be something shared with you all and hopefully you’ll enjoy reading about this world as much as I enjoy working on it.</p>
<p>Funds raised for this campaign will go directly into printing costs. My goal is to have enough raised to take to various local comic shops, libraries, and conventions. </p>
<p>So... <strong>“What’s the pitch?”</strong> You ask?</p>
<p>Well, step right up! We’re getting to that part in <i>3... 2... 1... </i></p>

<h3><u>Rewards Breakdown</u></h3>
<p>While the goal for this campaign is  $500, one of the largest reasons for using Indiegogo is because of their <u>flex goal option</u>! This way, even if I don’t make my goal, I can still fulfill the pledges of backers regardless. Remember: the book is finished! Overall fulfillment is only hampered by printing costs. </p>
<p><i>(Side note: If you’re a Central Florida local, you can come to <strong>BAMF Comics and Coffee</strong> to pick up your pledge reward from me directly and I’ll throw in a cup of their awesome coffee and a hug [who doesn’t like a good hug? Well, maybe you don’t like hugs - so come to BAMF, get your pledge,  hug-free])!</i></p>
<p><u><strong>Here’s a simple breakdown of rewards (see prices on the right sidebar):</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Digital Download (.pdf format) of Godlore: Whispered Truths &amp; Lost Lullabies Vol. 2</li>
<li>Digital Download (.pdf format) of Godlore: Whispered Truths &amp; Lost Lullabies Vol. 1 and 2</li>
<li>Print Copy of Godlore: Whispered Truths &amp; Lost Lullabies Vol. 2</li>
<li>Print Copies of Godlore: Whispered Truths &amp; Lost Lullabies Vol. 1 and 2</li>
<li>Print Copy of Godlore: Whispered Truths &amp; Lost Lullabies Vol. 2 + T-shirt (Your choice of print: Karim the Dragon God, or Aroan the Bear God)</li>
<li>Print Copies of Godlore: Whispered Truths &amp; Lost Lullabies Vol. 1 and 2 + T-shirt (Your choice of print: Karim the Dragon God, or Aroan the Bear God)</li>
<li>Print Copies of Godlore: Whispered Truths &amp; Lost Lullabies Vol. 1 and 2 + T-shirt (Your choice of print: Karim the Dragon God, or Aroan the Bear God) PLUS a custom 5”x7” commission of YOU as an Animal God!<i> **Limited to 5**</i>
</li>
</ul>
<p>**Each pledge reward includes the option to have <i>your</i> name printed in the acknowledgement section of Godlore, Vol 2. Let’s be honest: it’s not possible without you!**</p>
<p>Don’t want a pledge reward but still want to help? <i><strong>Donate!!</strong></i></p>
<p>Also, in my first campaign, I included <strong>“Become a God”</strong> as a pledge reward as well. Problem is, maybe people want a commission, but not everyone wants a comic or a T-shirt. If you want a commission from me, specifically while this campaign is live, it will go directly to the goal. Please feel free to <i>contact me directly at brianluesang@me.com and mention this campaign</i>, <u>I’ll add your name to the acknowledgements in Volume 2 as well. </u></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Pricing, Content, and all the In Betweens</h3>
<p>This comic book (along with my previous one, and the ones planned) is <i>extremely</i> important to me as I explained before. However, while that may be the case, I also approach the crowdfunding campaigns from the perspective of a potential backer. That’s why this campaign is being launched now, <i>after the book is finished</i> (again, with the exception of the inclusion of pinups), that way there is very little down time from the end of the campaign to pledge fulfillment. </p>
<p>Godlore: Whispered Truths and Lost Lullabies Vol. 1 was approached the same way. <i><u>The book was finished first</u></i> to ensure that wouldn’t be the hurdle in fulfillment. <i>This won’t be any different</i>. </p>
<p>Additionally, I went into both books with the idea of providing enough content to make the pledge cost worth it as a backer. Here’s how I look at it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, the lowest pledge for a <i>print version is $15 </i>. It’s an <u>indie comic</u>, so that means there’s no large scale distribution and/or sales to help offset the price tag to something typical of the mainstream. <i>Note that domestic U.S. shipping is free for this pledge tier.</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>HOWEVER</strong>... it’s <strong>40+ pages of content</strong>, which makes it almost <i>twice</i> the size of your standard comic. So now that price tag seems a lot more reasonable, right?</li>
<li>The good news is that your pledges will be fostering not just this project, but the indie comic industry on a whole. It’s a small, but defiant and relentless group who do what we do for the love of the medium and the stories we tell. Personally speaking, it will help me offset cost to keep on creating!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Currently, the only risk is not making the campaign goal. However, as previously mentioned, Indiegogo’s flex goal option will allow for limited print cost coverage to fulfill the backers who pledge regardless of hitting goal.</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><p><i>Regardless of you backing the campaign or not - <u>spread the word!</u></i> This book has fantasy, horror, and other comic-y thingies! You’ve got to know <i>someone</i> who may be interested, right? If you’ve made it all the way down to this part of the campaign page it’s safe to say you probably do (or you’ve got a thing for reading things thoroughly). Everything helps, and<i><strong> I fully appreciate it all!</strong></i></p><p>Thanks!</p><p><i>-Brian</i></p></div>","Hi Everyone!

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Written by Tim Holden and illustrated by Ivan Fanning, Dog Fight is a fascinating insight into twenty serial chapters of untold true stories during the period of World War 2. Beginning on the very first day we are thrown into the action as the fighting, chaos and treachery begins. The story is centered around the 121st Polish Air-force squadron whose numbers are halved during the first seventeen days of the war and we then follow the survivors as they make a great journey that took them onward to France, North Africa and finally Britain to battle the enemy. We take the dog metaphor a step deeper using anthropomorphic dogs as the characters. </p>
<p>The story delves deep into unheard of and remarkable events that changed nations not only during the war but that still leave their mark on the people to this day. Help us get dog fight off the ground and we will provide enthusiasts with a story that is compelling, engaging and also lovely to look at. We are both avid story tellers and hopefully you will get as lost in these true stories as we have.</p>

She also adapts Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug and Cat Noir to comics and co-writes DollFace.Outside of Action Lab, Nicole writes comic book related articles for Comic Frontline, works as a freelance editor and is currently writing the second issue of her successful Kickstarter comic, Road Trip to Hell.The script is written and edited, the artist is on board, the printers are ready and as long as we're fully funded we'll be able to deliver all of your rewards by January 2021.Apart from the book itself, the first reward that I'm excited about is an additional reward that isn't listed for those of you at the print copy (£10) and above reward levels will receive 2 character colouring cards you can see below at no extra cost. One side will be Mikael's full version and the other will be the line art version. The cards themselves will be A5 (210x148mm) in size, 300gm thick and uncoated, so that you can properly colour in the line art side however you like.The second reward I'm excited about are the waterproof device stickers that you can stick on your phone, tablet, laptop or anywhere you like really. And when I say waterproof it doesn't mean it makes your phone waterproof, it means that the adhesive of the sticker is waterproof. I'm sure you assumed that but you can never be too careful.Disclaimer aside, we have 3 designs; the ACCESS DENIED title, the front cover and the PLANETS OF POWER design. At this point you won't know what PLANETS OF POWER is, but one of our main characters, Robert, is big into TRPG's (tactical role-playing games) and POP is his favourite TRPG. For those of you with a keen eye, you might notice that, Robert has a PLANETS OF POWER sticker on the back of his phone. So, if you'd like to get the same sticker feel free to go for the sticker level reward.The third reward I'm excited for is 40 piece jigsaw puzzle. It might seem an odd reward but one of our main characters, Robert, is a dab hand at puzzles and strategy games. The jigsaw itself is 4mm thick and is presented in a cardboard tray to make it easier to keep together. The last reward I'm excited for is the hardcover option. Over the course of the campaign I've had a fair few messages from backers about the possibility of a hardcover option of ACCESS DENIED. I've managed to price it up from our printers, Mixam, and it's possible to do at £25 for the reward plus £5 postage for the UK and £15 for the rest of the world. Although, the book and the postage are a bit more expensive than the standard print copy, it's bound to make your bookshelf looking amazing if you go for it. Here's an example of the hardcover option from Mixam, courtesy of Dina Norlund.Thanks for reading, and if you have any questions at all please be sure to get in touch, as we're more than happy to help!Hoping that you're able to help us make our dreams become a reality :) SGL Risks and challengesThe script is written and edited, the artist is on board, the printers are ready. The only risk we face is that we don't get funded. If you like what you see, please back us and be sure to share ACCESS DENIED with your friends.",16.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello Cosplay Community!!!</p>
<p>If you are anything like us you grew up watching Ninja Turtles, Ghostbusters, Voltron, Doctor Who, Scooby Doo, Superman and X-men among many many more amazing shows/cartoons and comics! If this is the case then do we have an amazing project for you.</p>
<p>We have created an amazing book that focuses on Cosplay and those that love to participate. This project has been a labor of love and a huge privileged and honor to work on. We have met so many awesome people during our journey.</p>
<p>The journey started in 2019 after Danial (one of the creators) was diagnosed with Cancer. After being diagnosed Danial was not able to attend cons because of the possibility of getting sick with a compromised immune system.  This became a huge part to the start of Heroes and Villains. Danial needed something he could focus on for recovery instead of dwelling on being sick. Danial approached Justin with a new idea for a Cosplay Book and thus they began a journey that they never realized was as big as it has become. </p>
<p>The original project was to do 15 photo shoots and put together a couple behind the scenes shots, mix in some interviews and boom a cool book to look at. Well that all changed in the blink of an eye. We put out a post in a couple Facebook groups, called a comic shop owner to set up shoots in his building, spoke to some cosplayers and we scheduled 40 shoots. As we started the shoots we also started getting more traction from more and more people ( a little more about that in a minute).</p>
<p>COVID STRIKES </p>
<p>So we all know that Covid has killed 2020 and the cons. It also tried to derail our project and that was not going to happen. We took some time away from shoots but we didn't take time away from the book. We continue to work toward the publication of Heroes and Villains. We have done a few more shoots, we have interviewed cosplayers and artists, (Remember I said a bit more Later? Well this is later), We have spoken to comic book writers and owners and have been given permission to publish pages from their comics in the book as well as offering SIGNED COPIES in the perks! That's right. You read it correctly. Signed Copies of their comics.  </p>
<p>Covid also had some major changes for us. We lost several printers due to covid and the fact they print in China. We had to go back to the drawing board so to speak. We had many zoom meetings to discuss whats next. We came up with a major change and one we are excited about.</p>
<p>We are printing Heroes and Villains as a volume collection. The book was always intended to be a series but covid helped us change it into a graphic novel style book of volumes. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>So what are the risks? Well to be honest and transparent there are a couple risks associated with this campaign. The first risk is that covid could cause more printers to either go out of business or up their costs. If this happens then we will compile a list of all the printers out there and be vigilant about contacting them and negotiating the best deal possible to get the book to print. We will also look at other ways to get the finishing funds to complete the book. Even if we have to sell one of our friends kidneys. Just kidding. We haven't asked him yet. No, but we will honestly do everything in our power to get the book to print. </p>
<p>The second risk is that we do not raise enough money to go to print. Again, this is something we have been discussing and we will find a way to get the finishing funds. We are actively building contingency plans as we move forward. </p>
<p>The third risk is that it takes longer than expected to go to print. If this is the case we will be diligent about updating everyone and allowing there to be a dialog between us and our fans and backers. We understand that without YOU, this book is just a dream. Like all of you we love cosplay and want to see this a reality.</p>

<h3>What about the cost of travelling across all the places from east cost to west coast, why hasn´t it been provisioned for ?</h3>
<p>My experience in 2014 of hitch hiking from Up State New York to Florida, then across to Texas, to move up to Montana and down till California enables me to be able to travel across to my present destinations.</p>
<h3>Wait a minute isn´t hitch hiking illegal? </h3>
<p>It is a myth, after doing extensive research and true experience, certain precautions are meant to be taken to be on the right side of the law. <br/></p>
<p>Primarily being on the start of exits on Interstate highways, old state highways are open to hitchhiking, respecting the local town rules &amp; police officers if they prohibit the same to walk out or bus out of the jurisdiction. In fact several good souls in uniform have driven me to the next feasible spot of hitching a ride. This has enabled me to keep a clean record so far.</p>
<h3>What about shelter at night, where there is no couch surfers or local friends, what is my provision for it?</h3>
<p>To seek accomodation in the local church or connect with locals for the best information, Alternatively on the interstates there are 24 hour´s Truck Stops with drivers lounge,  gas stations and cafe ( where the bottomless cup of coffee helps in staying awake till sun rise) to seek shelter at night. <br/></p>
<h3>What about the expenses of food or accomodations beyond 40 days ?</h3>
<p>Well the idea is to connect with individuals or communities with organic farming, spiritual, other similar activities to volunteer in exchange for food and accomodation to spend more time in a place, like my past experience in 2014 of doing lawn work, oriental rug cleaning, picking organic potates, house sitting, pet sitting in exchange for food and accomodation. There by limiting my on land travel time and expenses to bare minimum.</p>
<h3>What if there isn´t sufficient contribution to undertake the journey?</h3>
<p>Money is only the means and not the end, hence there is deep faith in me to undertake the journey with the fire of intent and positivity, which has enabled me to sustain and travel inspite of running out of money twice in Mexico and Gautemala.</p>
<p>Although without your contributions and support, undertaking my journey would be an uphill task. <br/></p>
<h3>Well what do you get in return for your financial and intangible contributions?</h3>
<p>For sharing this proposal on facebook, indiegogo, personal blogs, other social media platforms or contributing monetorily, you will get  online access to my google drive folder of several guided meditations, meditation music and techniques to enable them to do it at their own space.

Duncan Weller here.  I'm about to complete my first novel, a very cool 'Graphic Illustrated Science Fiction Novel' called “Flight of the Silk.""  It will be about 220 pages long and contain 85 original illustrations.  This will be my 7th book!  To make it special, I thought I would give everyone out there the opportunity to participate in its creation and get something unique out of the process.  I've never crowdfunded before, and I may never again, so let's give it a shot!  Everyone who participates will get their perk, regardless if the funding goal is met or not. I'm looking to raise $5000 towards the initial printing run.This campaign will help create the first pressing that will be a hand-numbered, signed, special limited edition of ""Flight of the Silk"" with an original cartoon drawing in each book. THE STORY
Shot through
deep space a tiny green globe explodes into the vicinity of a deep space probe.
The probe, a Telennica, collects the green globe and returns it to the Silk
planet Terrat for examination. The Silk discover a message within the globe and it is
a plea for help from a mysterious alien species. 

The aliens live in another part of the galaxy and are running out of food. If no one helps, these aliens could all die. But the possibility of traveling through deep space is considered impossible and suicidal for anyone brave enough to attempt the trip. This is the first time the Silk (two species called Gilks and Gams) have encountered intelligent alien life, so it's a thrill for some, but freaks out others.


Doubts surface about the alien’s true intentions. Naysayers dream up fearful fates for those they think crazy enough to make the journey. However, a young Gilk apprentice-scientist named Rit makes a strong plea to at least entertain the idea of saving the aliens.

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>If you're not familiar with Indiegogo or crowdfunding in general, here's a brief overview: </p>
<p>For the next 45 days, you'll be able to make pledges to help support the creation of Issue #1 of <strong><i>Time Spanners</i></strong>, ranging from $1 to whatever you can afford. You can select one of the perks on the right, corresponding to the amount you wish to donate. This means you're not only helping us out, you are also receiving some cool stuff in return! </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $2500 to finish Issue #2 of <strong><i>Time Spanners</i></strong>. We have the cover of issue 2 finished, and you can see it here. Our dream is to turn the entire story into a graphic novel composed of 10 or 12 issues of the comic. John has already written the script for issue 2, and the money we’re raising here will go towards paying an artist to pencil the pages as well as to pay Brendan to ink, color, and letter Issue #2. Anything we raise above the $2500 we’re seeking will go toward starting Issue #3 and whatever future issues possible.</p>
<p>We have chosen a <strong>Flexible Funding</strong> program so that whatever money you donate will go directly to completion of Issue #2 (and any potential future issues if we raise more), whether we reach our goal of $2500 or not.</p>
<p>Indiegogo's platform fee on all funds raised is 5%. Fees are deducted from the funds we actually raise (not the goal we set). In addition Credit Card processors will charge us (not you) a processing fee, based on several factors, including the funding type and currency you choose, and the country in which your bank is located. Flexible funding campaigns can accept contributions through PayPal, credit card, or both.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Without your help, we won’t be able to realize our dream of turning <strong><i>Time Spanners</i></strong> into a graphic novel.  It takes time, no pun intended, and lots and lots of effort to draw each panel of a comic book, and we’re looking at 10 to 12 issues before we are finished. Time that we all have to take away from our own regular jobs. You can see a small portion of the detailed work that goes into one such panel (of at least 22 needed) in the video. </p>
<p>As artists, we ultimately rely on the public’s support, one way or another. In the bad old days, we’d also have had to pitch this to comic book companies instead of Hollywood producers, to get them to publish our comic, but in this day and age of crowdfunding, we don’t need those guys. All we need is you!</p>
<p>So if you like what we’re trying to do here, if you’re as excited about it as we are, then by making a pledge, you can help us create a comic book. Your donation will make you a comic book producer just like Marvel or DC! How cool is that!? <br/><br/>And with so many avenues out there to sell the comic, including a dozen local comic book shops in the Cleveland area that carry Time Spanners, including Comic Heaven, Comics and Friends, Nine Realms, Mac’s Backs and Imaginary Worlds, as well as websites like Comixology, Indyplanet, and DriveThru on the internet, you will be able to point to <strong><i>Time Spanners</i></strong> and say, “I helped get that comic made!”</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute much, if anything—as starving artists ourselves, we understand that.  That’s why we’ve made it possible for you to pledge as little as $5 to get a reward (in our case, a digital download of Issue #1). For those of you who can’t even do $1, we ask you to help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign via email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or plain old word of mouth. You can even use the Indiegogo share tools to help!</p>
<p><strong>If you can make a pledge, you will help us realize our dream and get a reward too! That’s all there is to it. </strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hope Flood </strong>(<a href=""http://hopeflood.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hopeflood.com</a>) is one of the top comediennes in the industry with her commitment and dedication to comedians  as well as her numerous ventures to keep them upwardly mobile in the entertainment business. Hope has had a successful career in comedy for over 27 years. Surviving in any business for 27 years is an accomplishment within itself, especially in the ""male-dominated"" business of comedy. Hope has accumulated a wealth of knowledge and she has paved the way for up and coming comics and has been inspired to pass her experience on to the next generation of emerging comedians.</p>
<p>This inspiration is what gave birth to the <strong>Females In Comedy Association (FICA).</strong></p>
<p><strong>FICA</strong> is a group designed for the comediennes to develop, refine and build on their craft as they learn how to break into or to stay in the business. <strong>FICA’s</strong> sole purpose is for comediennes to network, mentor, and collaborate with one another as they learn to implement the skills of success.  This group has spread world-wide and gained the attention of many comediennes all over the globe from the novice to the established seasoned professional. The only requirement is that you must be a Female Comedian who is open to learning and growing.</p>
<p>In 2012 she did the first ever all female <strong> COMEDY CONVENTION</strong></p>
<p>Although the convention was originally branded as the <strong>Females in Comedy Convention</strong>, it is the vision of founder Hope Flood to include ALL COMEDIANS regardless of gender.</p>
<p>In <strong>2014</strong> it was re-branded and is now call the <strong>""COMICS ROCK CONVENTION"" (CRC)</strong></p>
<p>The CRC  will bring together comedians for all across the US and Canada for <strong>FIVE</strong> days of educational and career-advancing opportunities. With intensive and accelerated workshops, seminars and information sessions, industry attended showcases, a variety of networking events and they get to Showcase at some of LA""s mainstream comedy clubs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise <strong>$10,000 by April</strong> to cover the expenses of the Convention production. Needless to say producing a convention of this magnitude is no small feat, and there are ""large expenses"" involved. One of CRC’s main goals is to be able to allow all comedians who wish to take advantage of this opportunity to participate regardless of their ability to pay.  Your donation would help us provide scholarships for  comedians from all over the nation, and  to introduce them into the Hollywood atmosphere. We'll be educating them on how to apply for comedy jobs, how to find an agent, how to write comedy, we guide people on why they should be in comedy and show them the value of learning more about the professional comedy scene.</p>
<p>We would like to provide partial scholarships based on the financial needs of the comedians so we can provide professional support for as many as possible. Also finding sponsors has been a challenge we also want to cover paying staff, advertising/marketing, paying for the venues, deposits, key note speakers, accommodations such as hotel rooms, airfare, etc.</p>
<p>FICA supplemented the fees of 50% of the women who attended the 2012/2013 conventions.</p>
<p>Details of the convention please go to:<strong> <a href=""http://www.comicsrockconvention.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.comicsrockconvention.com</a></strong></p>If you know of any comedians that you feel can benefit from this convention please feel free to have them check out our website.

<p>Hi! I'm Karen. I'm a low income, disabled Filipina illustrator and most of my livelihood comes from my art. I sell my art books at queer book stores and do conventions throughout the year. I've made 2 wlw coloring books and have plans to make comics in the future, but the costs for printing can get rough as they come out of my very limited pockets. This is where you come in.</p>
<p>I've set the funds at 500 at bare minimum, but you are welcome to donate more. I'll love you very much if you help me out or at least share!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>500 is the minimum I set, which is enough for 3 limited 100 print runs of my books, plus new prints for one convention. If I get more somehow, I'll use it for my website costs, as well as new supplies, whether it be new paper or new software. Anyway, here are your perks:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>1 Dollar: Thank You Tier</strong></p>
<p>Donate 1 dollar and you have my eternal gratitude! Seriously, I appreciate every one who cares enough to give even a little bit. So thanks!</p>

My current project The Soul of a Hero Season 2 The Soul of a Hero is a FREE ongoing online comic book series that you can enjoy anytime by visiting www.SoulofaHero.com or Webtoons! I have a passion for comics, art, design, illustration and bringing creatives together work on projects! So much so, that I recently completed art school for the purpose of learning from industry professionals on how to make The Soul of a Hero a better comic book series!  My crowdfunding campaign is to help me make season two of my comic book series come to life. It’s important to me because I want to create new content for traditional comic book fans as well as those who just want to experience something new and fun. I’ve worked hard on learning my craft and now it’s time to share my story with the world! If you love new comics or just love me and want to see me succeed or both you are sure to enjoy The Soul of a Hero, a 1970s sploitation comic with Kung Fu Action and a superhero kick! Support my crowdfunding campaign today! Dynamic New Art! What We Need & What You GetThe Soul of Hero is a FREE online comic book series that has new content weekly, but the print version of the full comic book or digital copies can be purchased online at www.SoulofaHero.comI am attempting to raise $5,000 to help in the production for this season. It is my goal to get 100 people to donate $50 to this project.  If you feel inclined to do more I greatly appreciate it if you can only do less, my gratitude is the same! The money raised will help pay for contracted and commissioned artists and writers, art supplies, website maintenance, printing, and marketing. Though I am an independent content creator, I am an industry professional. I have worked for various clients and other comic projects making every deadline and producing industry creative standard work. Even if we don't make our financial goal this project WILL move forward! All funds earned will go directly to the production and paying the creatives who are contracted to assist. I believe in delivering on any promise made.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Why $1,800?</p>
<p>With printing a book this size (8.5''x 11'') at full color on good paper, things tend to add up quickly. We're hoping to get 130 copies printed in total. Each of the ten creators would get three copies, leaving 100 for backers and shops down the line. Printing CARGO #1 alone adds up to $1,500, and printing the zero issue, mini comics, and stickers will be another $300.  </p>
<p>Even if we don't make our goal of $1800, every backers' order will be fulfilled.</p>

<p>While getting pages in, designing the cover/ logo/ curation/ orientation of the book, and talking with printers/ feeling out alternative methods for printing has at times been as laborious as it is rewarding, we feel our contribution to the ever expanding world(s) of science fiction is ultimately a good and worthwhile one and we hope that some people out there will as well.  Every contributor to CARGO exceeds the parameters in their own unique way, making this book really something special.

<div>Imagine there was another cartoon, another comic, another toyline you knew nothing about, but it combined all the cheesyness and awesomeness of all the cartoons you love, even if it was just a ploy to sell toys, who cares? It had Rapping Astronaut Dinosaurs, Borderline Offensively Dressed Barbarians, Street Tough Extreme Sports Aficionado Mutants, and a Planet full of Ninjas!</div>

I bet you remember those magical 80's cartoons: Thundercats, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, He-Man, Silverhawks, the list goes on. I bet you remember the toys as well, they all had a special vehicle, a lair, a playset. I bet you remember the smell of your warm TV screen, of your plastic action figures, of your favorite worn out comic book. That is the feeling MASTER OF THE LORDS is going after, the smell of your childhood, even if you didn't grow up in the 80's.

Imagine there was another cartoon, another comic, another toyline you knew nothing about, but it combined all the cheesyness and awesomeness of all the cartoons you love, even if it was just a ploy to sell toys, who cares? It had Rapping Astronaut Dinosaurs, Borderline Offensively Dressed Barbarians, Street Tough Extreme Sports Aficionado Mutants, and a Planet full of Ninjas!


This Cartoon did exist, it just didn't in our Universe, but don't worry, we are bringing it here, in the form of a 60 PAGE GRAPHIC NOVEL. With your help we can bring the awesomeness of MASTER OF THE LORDS to this dimension!

But don't just take our word for it, you can read the entire first chapter for free HERE.

And while you are at it, you can listen to a 3 track Mini Soundtrack by ANCIENT ORDER OF THE DROIDS (they are also from another dimension) which will be available as one of the perks for this campaign.







About Us...My name is Gerardo Preciado, I'm a comic book writer, you may be familiar with some of the stories from my previous blog, a couple of them went viral (Batman: The Deal, Superman: God's End). Recently I also had the opportunity to debut in print with Grimm Tales of Terror # 9 (Zenescope), a love letter to 80's slasher films.




Last year, my super friend (and amazing artist) David Marquez (Warriors of Panlan, Annkidu) and I decided to create a new webcomics blog called OLD SKULL COMICS to tell stories that we would love to read ourselves, and most importantly, make them available online for free to everyone. You can see more of David's work on his Facebook Page.

We already have uploaded a short Sci-i/Horror story called 'LUNATIK', and as we mentioned before, the complete first chapter from 'MASTER OF THE LORDS' is available now, with more content coming very soon.



Variant Cover for MASTER OF THE LORDS: Chapter One by Co-Creator David Marquez

Why we need you
All the money raised thru this campaign will go to the artists illustrating the comic (I'm writing it myself, with character designs by David), as well as the actual manufacturing of the graphic novel and the rewards. David and I are not actually making a dime on this project, we just want to make it because we love it, and we think you'll love it too.




We are working with an amazing art team led by Luis Rivera, who magically capures the feeling of a lost 80's cartoon.

   Perky Perks
Our main perk is of course, a MASTER OF THE LORDS Graphic Novel in Hard Cover format, featuring 60 pages of story, plus concept art, and as many cool things as we can throw in it!. It will also be available in a HI RESOLUTION PDF.
But it doesn't stop there, we have the aforementioned 3 Track Mp3 Mini Soundtrack by ANCIENT ORDER OF THE DROIDS as well as Limited Edition T-Shirts, Coloring Books, Stickers, Buttons, Sketches and Original Art (We will be unveiling the final designs throughout the course of the campaign).




PLUS we have Early Bird Levels, the first people who support us on this levels will get an Extremely Limited Edition ANCIENT ORDER OF THE DROIDS 3 Track Mini Soundtrack on CASSETTE at no extra charge!


We cannot guarantee that you will look as cool as Don Johnson on our Limited Edition T-Shirt, but you will definitely look better than you look now!  Also, you should probably not wear a gun, unless you are an 80's cop or something.One of the four Original 11""x17"" Pencil  Art Covers from MASTER OF THE LORDS by David Marquez available as one of our rewards!FinallyWe would like to sincerely thank you for taking the time to read this.

<h3>Adam &amp; Eternity Project Summary</h3>
<p>As an up-and-coming comic creator, it is hard to make a mark in the industry with so much creative talent already out there. However, ""Adam &amp; Eternity"" means a great deal to me personally, and hopefully to you. I designed/created this journey to reflect the current times we live in, the often traumatizing, stressful anxieties most of us face when we are confronted with the question, ""Who am I?"" Struggling to find our identity/place in this world is something I have spent most of my life trying to understand. I always found the best solution to these questions is through creating stories. Adam &amp; Eternity will take place in a broken/apocalyptic realm known as Earth. Adam, our protagonist, will journey to known/unknown &amp; mythological places to slowly begin to piece together what it was that both brought us together and eventually destroyed us.</p>
<p>Each chapter will answer a specific question, concluding in a profound lesson I learned about myself. I plan to breakdown high-concept philosophies and make them digestible, entertaining, and beautifully conceptualized material onto jaw-dropping comic pages.</p>
<p>Adam &amp; Eternity will be introducing my artist and collaborator, Oscar Dominic Armendariz Pinto, but you can call him <i>Dom</i>. Dominic is an Amateur Mexican Comic Book Artist. He has been spending the last year and a half as a professional/full-time comic book artist! Dom studied architecture here in Mexico, but in the end, his love for comics oriented him to this profession.</p>
<p>Dom loves to try different styles, but in the end, his excellence drawing incredibly detailed backgrounds with a more anime-ish character are the approach we found both perfect and eye-catching for this project.</p>
<p>Our Colorist, Jake “JaSketch” Gustafson, is an up and coming Comic Book Colorist, Illustrator, and Character Designer. His love for animation and comics are what inspired him to get into the creative field.</p>
<p>Jake has a great love for wild colors, heavily inspired by works such as Bryan Lee O'Malley's Scott Pilgrim (Colored run), Tyson Hesse’s ""Diesel"", and JoJo’s ""Bizarre Adventure"". Adam &amp; Eternity will be no exception in addition to these great works.</p>
<p>Both Robby, Dom, and Jake want to say thank you for your attention, we hope for your continued support with Adam &amp; Eternity. </p>
<h3>Series Synopsis: </h3>
<p>Logline: An impossible creation learns to become human through a spectacularly mythological, but grounded journey. Once finishing this unlikely journey of discovery, it is then given a choice to decide the fate of the broken universe he was born into.</p>
<p>Synopsis: Adam awakes in a womb between dimensions. Unaware of how he was propelled into existence, Adam bursts from his womb into a bleed of beautiful colors and light. He asks, “Who am I?” He explores this desolate and post-apocalyptic realm called Earth. He discovers what it means to become human, despite himself being the most powerful being to ever exist. How god became man, by learning from humanity. Its mistakes, its creations, its dreams, and hopes all kindle Adam's journey to discover how he can save this world. Or does he choose to leave it behind?<br/> </p>

We use allegories, metaphors, and some jaw-dropping imagery to propel the story to the pinnacle of storytelling: <i>Comic Books</i>.</p>
<p>This Project is <i>Me, Dom, &amp; Jake</i>. This is us, <i>modern creators</i>, using our stories to help those trying to do the same. A Story that will help you get through the tough times and the best times. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>America is falling. One man loses everything due to government deception. How far will he go for justice and revenge?</p>
<ul>
<li>I am the creator and artist of 'Truther'. I have felt compelled to write this story and share it with other freedom loving individuals. I am the only person writing and creating this graphic novel. No team. No bosses to please. It is the product of a lot of time spent researching, writing, and drawing. As a professional artist, I have drawn many projects before but have never written a single story until now; and it's flowing like honey!</li>
<li>The line between parody and real life is blurred. Truther is set in a fictional world that resembles our own, but is filled with real research and information that anyone can investigate for themselves. This project is important for me to share with you because we are living in a time where information, true of false, is used as a weapon. It seems all aspects of mainstream media and entertainment are self destructing under the woke agenda. We need  stories like this to relate to and find strength. </li>
<li>If you support TRUTHER issue #1 I will have the means to continue my character's journey to the end. I already have all plot points and storylines written down as I fill the pages with art and dialogue. I have 37 pages completed and plan on making this graphic novel about 60+/- pages total. With the money raised I will be able to complete the book on schedule and deliver the best quality for backers. Your support will fuel the fire of patriotism for all people lucky enough to grace these pages. </li>

<li>Money will go towards finishing the art for Issue #1, and possibly coloring every page, making sure paper weight is perfect, and maybe even creating a hard cover.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Let's make this graphic novel so popular that no 'Normie' or Leftist can ignore it.</li>
<li>Wake up friends and family that are still in the dark. This story is sure to challenge the perception of what's happening to our country.  </li>
<li>Stop supporting the 'woke' agenda that seems to be in every aspect of mainstream entertainment. This story will give you hope, and someone to cheer for, as Alex's story unfolds.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Being my first self-published work, I will need to research every aspect of creating, printing, and fulfilling orders for the first time.</li>
<li>Though the story is fully flushed out, I am in the middle of finishing the artwork. I will only be able to color it if a certain goal is met.</li>
<li>I would like to produce this graphic novel with local printers and shops only. I am a big believer in supporting small local shops. I have already reached out to those shops that will help me fulfill the orders of the comic, posters, stickers and even tote bags.</li>

<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>UNSTITCHED is a 48-page story about a T.E.D.D.Y trying to keep the dreams and imagination of a little girl safe from The Darkness, who wants to corrupt it with fear. UNSTITCHED is a blend of Rise Of The Guardians, Toy Story, and Coraline.   </p>
<p>Childhood wonder is built on dreams, hope, and imagination with fear being what unstitches it. The Darkness is fear taken form but is held at bay for now by Eleanor's nightlight. It is up to a brand new T.E.D.D.Y (Terrifecally. Effective. Dreaming. Defender. Yeah) to protect her and her nightlight from the goons working for The Darkness trying to break the light and terrorize her without becoming UNSTITCHED in the process.  </p>

<li>free copies (electronic and/or physical) of <i>Sovadron</i>

Sovadron: The Story

Lt. Shakairra Romazi isn’t sure who will kill her first: the enemy’s soldiers, or her own.
Her money is on the latter. After barely surviving their country’s last war, Shakairra and her soldiers are pulled into another. Goblins have been kidnapping citizens and selling them into slavery. But when a foreign noble arrives to investigate the death of his sister, Shakairra learns that the greater threat is within her own ranks.
As the body count climbs and her allies diminish, Shakairra must place her trust--never in abundant supply--into four strangers to save her country. But they soon realize this conflict is greater than that. And before this is over, even the blood of gods will be spilled.

<h3>Concepts On Demand</h3>
<p>Hi I'm E. Clifton Wilson also known professionally as CLIF and I've worked as a designer for over 15 years and I'm proud to see how far we've come creatively and as a company. Over the years I've had a lot of job titles in the creative industry. Concept artist, 3D sculptor/toy designer, animator, HTML 5 ad designer, comic book illustrator, production designer. This campaign is special because we're in a position where we can produce good work not only for 3RD Sun Entertainment but for others who have ideas they want to see come to life. So we came up with the name Concepts on Demand as our service side of the company. Originally the push was just to produce a Set Walker action figure and sequel comic book to our series Hollow Bones then we realized our services are unique and we can help out other independents like writers who need illustration, or artists who need toy prototypes as well as corporations who need our services. So that idea you had to produce your own comic book toy or t-shirt, we can make it happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Of course we'd need lots of money to make a huge impact, that's where you come in. We believe our products and services are so good, we've got something for everyone. Some of our unique perks include POSTERS + COMIC BOOKS + CUSTOM ACTION FIGURES + WEAPONS PACKS + MINIATURE FIGURES &amp; 3D PRINTS + T-SHIRTS + HATS  &amp; lots of other stuff YOU CREATE. The Unique thing is we're designers for all types of businesses including indie comic makers so if you've GOT AN IDEA? WE CAN CREATE IT. Get custom comic books, toys and all the said stuff above along with custom commercials to help you sell your product. Each dollar goes toward filling perk orders and supplies to create new products.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If your a collector who loves toys or a producer of films &amp; shorts who needs models we're the guys who can turn your idea into an actual production quality product in comics magazines, action figures and tees. Use the products for presentations, trade shows or sell online on your own web store. I've sold products and designs for years for companies, and major ad agencies and independent comic book publishers. We've built a reputation of quality work and the ability to give the client what they asked for and better. We get it done faster and with results that take you from sketches to a full production quality product you can sell or keep for your own personal collection.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks are clients who have short periods of time to get products done for presentations or whatever reason will need to give us a at least 3 months to get a good product in 3D Models and action figures for production quality pieces. However sample products can be available quicker to chart progress. On average you could expect 6-8 months for really difficult toy projects before final approval. Lighter projects like illustrations take less time as well as T-Shirts. We also are working on live streaming of illustrations to the client so critical input can be covered quickly eliminating all the redo and do-overs that waste precious time. We currently have a capacity to do short runs in the states of about 100 figures, a few thousand posters and t- shirts however we've built relationships with manufacturers to handle larger orders and ease production costs. We've got a step by step process to chart the progress of each project, even when there's design changes to be made we can still stay on course. We also have the option of 3D printing complete figures and accessories as well sculpting, mold, duplication process. This is Michigan home to some of the best tool and die manufacturers in the country we can create a mold designed to fit your needs. We've built relationships with injection molding manufacturers, and suppliers to help us meet the demand and keep projects on course.</p>

</h3> <p><i>EXTRACTION! Comix Reportage</i> is an anthology of comics journalism. Over the course of 2 years, journalists and researchers teamed up with illustrators to document the horrific and often criminal activities of mining companies here in North America, and abroad. <br/></p>
<p><i>EXTRACTION!</i> includes:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Four stand-alone works of comics journalism, documenting the activities of Goldcorp in Guatemala (<b>Gold</b>), Cameco in the Northwest Territories (<b>Uranium</b>), Alcan in India (<b>Aluminum/Bauxite</b>), and Suncor and other investors in the Canadian Athabasca Tar Sands (<b>Oil</b>)<br/>
</li> <li>Features work from award-winning journalists: <b>Dawn Paley</b> (<i>'Drug War Capitalism'</i>), <b>Tamara Herman</b> (<i>'We Call Them Intruders</i>'), <b>Sophie Toupin</b> and <b>Petr Cizek</b><br/>
</li> <li>Comics and illustrations from award-winning artists: <b>Jeff Lemire</b>, <b>Phil Angers</b>, <b>Joe Ollmann</b>, <b>Alain Reno</b>, <b>Carlos Santos</b>, <b>Ruth Tait</b>, and <b>Stanley Wany</b>
</li>
<li>Each comic includes first-hand accounts of the impact these industries are having on local communities and their ecosystems.<br/>
</li> </ul> <p>The <i>EXTRACTION!</i> anthology is 130 pages, softcover, colour cover with black and white interior, printed in Canada. <br/></p>
<p><b>OUR GOALS</b> with this crowdfunder are to cover our initial costs, and start conversations with readers about the impact of the extraction economy.  <br/></p>
<p>While we're at it, we want to connect with concerned individuals and organizations who can use engaging educational materials like these in their work. <b>If you are an educator, librarian, or some other kind of community organizer, we'd love to hear from you! </b><br/></p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why Canadian Mining Companies?<br/>
</h3> <p>Canada is home for 60% of the world’s publicly-traded mining companies.¹</p>
<p>Canadian companies currently hold the rights to thousands of mines and prospective mine sites worldwide. Development of mineral resources tends to come at the expense of local populations, who are not consulted about the projects, nor do they benefit from the resources extracted. Within Canada's borders, indigenous communities regularly suffer from community displacement and environmental devastation as a result of resource development.<br/><br/></p>

<br/> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>How Can A Comic Impact the Canadian Mining Industry?<br/>

 EXTRACTION! Comix Reportage is an anthology of comics journalism. Over the course of 2 years, journalists and researchers teamed up with illustrators to document the horrific and often criminal activities of mining companies here in North America, and abroad. 
EXTRACTION! includes:  Four stand-alone works of comics journalism, documenting the activities of Goldcorp in Guatemala (Gold), Cameco in the Northwest Territories (Uranium), Alcan in India (Aluminum/Bauxite), and Suncor and other investors in the Canadian Athabasca Tar Sands (Oil)
 Features work from award-winning journalists: Dawn Paley ('Drug War Capitalism'), Tamara Herman ('We Call Them Intruders'), Sophie Toupin and Petr Cizek
 Comics and illustrations from award-winning artists: Jeff Lemire, Phil Angers, Joe Ollmann, Alain Reno, Carlos Santos, Ruth Tait, and Stanley Wany

Each comic includes first-hand accounts of the impact these industries are having on local communities and their ecosystems.
  The EXTRACTION! anthology is 130 pages, softcover, colour cover with black and white interior, printed in Canada. 
OUR GOALS with this crowdfunder are to cover our initial costs, and start conversations with readers about the impact of the extraction economy.  
While we're at it, we want to connect with concerned individuals and organizations who can use engaging educational materials like these in their work. If you are an educator, librarian, or some other kind of community organizer, we'd love to hear from you! 
   Why Canadian Mining Companies?
 Canada is home for 60% of the world’s publicly-traded mining companies.¹
Canadian companies currently hold the rights to thousands of mines and prospective mine sites worldwide. Development of mineral resources tends to come at the expense of local populations, who are not consulted about the projects, nor do they benefit from the resources extracted. Within Canada's borders, indigenous communities regularly suffer from community displacement and environmental devastation as a result of resource development.


    How Can A Comic Impact the Canadian Mining Industry?
 Knowingly and unknowingly, we all participate in extraction industries, whether it's the gas in our car tanks, the aluminum foil in our kitchens, or the nuclear energy providing power to our towns and cities. Here in Canada, for instance, we all  invest in Canadian mining companies through the Canada Pension Plan,² whether we like it or not! 
And yet, these companies participate in human rights violations and environmental devastation that we find detestable. 
So what can a book of comics do about that?  Comics are one of the fastest-growing sections of all American libraries.³ Comics can engage readers who might pass over more formal writing on a serious subject like mining and extraction industries.
""EXTRACTION!"" speaks as much to the history of mining as to current events. This makes the book a great primer for anyone wishing to better understand the industry as a whole. 
 Getting ""EXTRACTION!"" into the hands of students, educators, and other concerned citizens strengthens the position of indigenous, environmental,  and human rights activists who are fighting back.

<h3>THANK YOU!</h3>
<p>Bode fans, friends and family!<br/><br/>These last few months have been an absolute roller-coaster ride. Around the world and back to Clarion Alley… To quote the Dead, “What a long strange trip it’s been.” I have been so fortunate and blessed to have met some of the coolest and most talented people on the planet. To have been given the gift of a life filled with art in abundance brings me to my knees in thanks everyday. Surely, somewhere in this vast, connected universe, Vaughn is smiling right now, I know it.<br/><br/>This has been a labor of love, and the good news is, we are nearly done! I have finished 65 of the 80 pages for the book, and we are currently in production on the cartoon and videogame. We have a small but mighty team of artists and animators that have been working on this project for years on a zero budget, but with love and dedication. I said it before… If we don’t reach our goal, we will still continue… Either way, the COBALT 60 CHRONICLES are coming, and now, thanks to this Indiegogo, everybody knows!<br/><br/>So, what’s next for Cobalt 60? Well, we keep on keeping on. Cobalt 60 is 50 years old this year… Perhaps it will take until his 60th? Smirks. Well, if that is what it takes, so be it. As an independent artist, this isn’t the first time we’ve been under-funded, ya know? We will ship the limited edition AR Comic in August for sure, and we’ve got a few more surprises up our sleeves in the coming months…. So stay tuned!<br/><br/>All my deepest thanks to my team, my family, my friends, and most of all to you, the fans!<br/><br/>--<br/>Mark Bode<br/>cobalt60bybode@gmail.com<br/><a href=""http://www.cobalt60bybode.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cobalt60bybode.com</a></p> <h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492257897/nfg7l12gvkfllyn9bvsk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>

<h3>BOLDER, DARKER, SEXIER... AND, AS USUAL...<br/>COBALT IS VERY PISSED OFF! </h3>
<p>In the last comic, Cobalt was captured after an unprecedented blood bath of violence and carnage. Exposed and de-hooded, it was revealed that he was indeed the long-lost heir to the throne, much to the celebration of the Radio people. Yet, Cobalt was a terrible king... and felt strapped to the throne of the people he hates.</p>
<p>That’s where the new comic starts. This the first Cobalt 60 comic I have published in years, and the first ever Cobalt 60 animation ever created. This will be the 6th graphic novel in the series, an 80-page story of Cobalt after he bares an heir with Queen BBC and escapes his bondage back into the desert.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485427994/xnmlc1lvs6gzphfg0xwd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>We've kept it PG-13 for display here on IndieGoGo, but believe me,  the Cobalt 60 Chronicles is chock full of violence, sex, and very bad behavior. It's Cobalt 60 in full effect, and definitely NSFW!</p>

<p><i>Cobalt 60 first appearance in Witzend #7, April 1, 1970 by Vaughn Bode</i><br/><br/>WHY INDIEGOGO? WHY NOW?</p>
<p>Independence. This project is near and dear to my heart. We are going to bring Cobalt out the exactly the way it’s supposed to be... Raw... Hard... the way my Dad imagined him. I’m crowdfunding this because it’s an incredible opportunity to connect with you, the fans. You get it. The Cobalt 60 Chronicles is an over-the-top, no-holds-barred tribute to Bode fans old and new.</p>
<h3>
<br/>HOW MUCH ASS WILL COBALT 60 KICK?</h3>
<p>In 1967, Cobalt 60 was one of the first comics ever to feature ultra-violence, sex and a bleak look at our future, years ahead of influencing the films by George Miller, Ralph Bakshi, and Roger Corman and thousands of artists worldwide. In 2017, we are going to bring it even harder… More carnage... More sex and lust… More betrayal… More mutants… All brought to life with modern animation techniques, including motion capture and photogrammetry.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488982311/cdi0mttyyrbhndvrvva5.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>PLUS... It’s <strong>Cobalt’s 50th Anniversary</strong>, so we’ve lined up lots of cool rewards exclusive to this campaign.  We have terrific print sets, truly collectible comics, blasts from the past and other surprises from the Bode archives... Many of them very limited. All of them are authentically rare, and all signed by Bode!</p>

<h3>FAN FUND THE COBALT 60 CHRONICLES!</h3>
<p>This is your chance to influence the kind of kick ass, take-no-prisoners Cobalt stories you wanna see. I want you to be our financiers. In return, we’ll make a cartoon and graphic novel that we can all be proud of. We believe fan funding is the best way to bring the Cobalt 60 Chronicles to life. This has been a long train coming, and if it wasn't for you, the fans, we would never have made it this far. Now, we need your help to get up this hill!<br/><br/>All of the assets have been built for the cartoon, and I have completed 65 of the 80 pages for the graphic novel. We already lined up the crew for finishing the cartoon pilot, the programming team for the Augmented Reality, and the print shop that is going to knock out the books. We are ready to rock through this final stage! We will start shipping rewards immediately upon completion of the campaign.  <br/><br/>Thank you so much for helping to make this happen. Please pledge now! If you can’t, that’s cool... But, maybe you can help by sharing on Facebook and Instagram? Got a Bode fan in your life? Let ‘em know! Every little bit helps!</p>

We are calling in all our favors, and every one of our talented crew is willing to do whatever it takes to make this happen. This year. Now.</p>
<p>A portion of the money will go to fulfilling all the cool rewards we are offering and a percentage will go to taxes and IndieGoGo fees. Anything over our goal will go towards funding future Cobalt 60 related projects... See our Stretch Goals, below!</p>

<p>The stretch goals are easy… MORE COBALT!!! We are re-telling the entire 50 year saga in 12x10 animated cartoons, interwoven with the new series of graphic novels. The comic and cartoon are intertwined, I guess is the best way to describe it! Some of the tale will play out in the comic, and then pick back up in the next cartoon episode, with the AR bridging the two!</p>
<p>We are also in development on the first Cobalt 60 video game, using assets directly from the cartoon. The game will be available on iOS, Android, and VR-capable PCs running HTC Vive VR goggles.</p>
<p>When all the episodes are finished, we want to release a hardcover COBALT 60 OMNIBUS COLLECTOR'S EDITION, with a Blu-Ray/Digital Copy of the entire 2-hour cartoon, plus the Video Game, and exclusive Cobalt and Queen BBC statue. </p>
<p>We have some other fun Bode apps on the horizon, as well… Bode Build-A-Broad app, anyone?</p>

<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>Creating a cartoon pilot and an Augmented Reality graphic novel is a challenge, of course. It has taken us two years to get to this point, and whether we achieve our crowdfunding goal or not, the Cobalt 60 Chronicles will get produced. The real challenge is when. We have been doing this ourselves, slowly and out of pocket, but with great love and dedication, and that won't stop no matter what. Sadly, without funding, it will take years to finish.</p>
<p>The good news is, we are nearly done! We have already lined up the crew for finishing the cartoon, the programming team for the Augmented Reality, and the print shop that is going to knock out the books. We are ready to rock through this final stage. With your help, it will be out this summer!</p>
<p>Our goal is to have everything launch at the San Diego Comic-Con this July. Should we not meet our funding goal, that date will be pushed back, but if we hit our goal, you better believe we are gonna deliver! Plus, all of our rewards are standing by to ship. We will begin shipping immediately upon completion of the campaign.</p>
<p>Our production, printer and shipping partners are secured, our budgets are complete, our shipping supplies are ready, and our manpower is lined up. We just gotta ship and get to work so we can finish in time for San Diego.</p>
<p>And regarding rewards fulfillment, I have an extensive publishing background, and I am proud of of my ship on time (or reasonably on time) record (mostly thanks to Molly!). We will make sure all your rewards are delivered as promised, packed securely. We take every phase of our campaign, including shipping, quite seriously. </p>
<h3>
<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</h3>
<p>I’d like to thank all the fans who have supported me over the years. I love meeting you guys at cons, at one of our showings, or on location when I am blasting the bricks. I’d like to thank all the readers and collectors who have supported me, as well as those newcomers to the Bode Worlds! Welcome aboard! </p>

<h3>LEGACY: 50 YEARS OF BODE STYLE</h3>
<div> </div>
<p>Vaughn Bode is touted as the very foundation of the hip hop style you see worldwide. The earliest graffiti writers of the NY city subway lines used our characters besides their groundbreaking pieces that started graffiti and the street art movement. Vaughn created such icons as Cheech Wizard, the Bode Lizard, Bode Broads and of course, Cobalt 60.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484965941/hqgg6ffrpziw0t6plvlv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>My fathers’ light in the adult comics scene burned bright in the 60’s and 70’s and like a comet he was gone off to ball the universe, and inspire tens of thousands of artists, movie makers and graffiti writers from the last 50 years. Vaughn created thousands of worlds populated by his unmistakable style and one of a kind characters. I have vigilantly carried on his vision into the mainstream subconscious of Pop Culture.</p>

<p>Vaughn Bodē first drew the character Cobalt 60 on a piece of scratch paper in 1959. Nearly ten years later, in 1968, he published a ten-page, black-and-white, pen-and-ink Cobalt 60 story for Ken Rudolph's sci-fi fanzine Shangri L'Affaires (a.k.a. Shaggy) #73. The story did not expound much on the character, instead concentrating on action and a thorough depiction of the story's setting.</p>
<p>Bodē wrote a prose follow-up of the story, with pencil illustrations, for Shaggy #74. Bodē won the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Fanzine Artist on the strength of Cobalt 60. In addition, the initial ten-page story was later republished in Witzend #7 (April 1970), in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Metal Hurlant in 1980, and in Epic Illustrated #27 (Dec. 1984).</p>

<h3>DUST DEVIL: THE COBALT 60 SAGA</h3>
<div> </div>
<p>Cobalt 60 takes place in our post apocalyptic Mad-Max-like future, where man's genius has sterilized our tiny planet, and left a barren wasteland populated with what is left of mankind's dregs… Radio men and women and a plethora of mutant humans and animals deformed by years of exposure to the radioactive desert that is our future.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487251839/ht8cvpdvarmm4qt9aezu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Cobalt is the heir to the human race. His family is considered the last of the genetic line in which no mutation is present. An evil mutated Prime Minister of Radio City, Strontium 90, assassinated Cobalt’s family in an attempt to wipe out the bloodline. Cobalt’s mother is tipped off before the murderous coup, and casts Cobalt into the desert as a child to be raised by the extradited and outcast mutants… Forced out of Radio City due to Strontium 90’s hatred, bigotry and racism.</p>
<p>Cobalt hides his face, concealing his identity with a hood, and strikes out against his own people to protect and defend his mutant brethren who raised him.</p>
<p>In the last comic, Cobalt was captured after an unprecedented blood bath of violence and carnage. Exposed and de-hooded, it was revealed that he was indeed the long-lost heir to the throne, much to the celebration of the Radio people. Yet, Cobalt was a terrible king... and felt strapped to the throne of the people he hates.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487252321/nukmgbeeujugnh84szk3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>That’s where the new comic starts. This the first Cobalt 60 comic I have published in over 20 years, and the first ever Cobalt 60 animation ever created. This will be the 6th graphic novel in the series, an 80-page story of Cobalt after he bares an heir with Queen BBC and escapes his bondage back into the desert.</p>

</div></div>","THANK YOU!
Bode fans, friends and family!These last few months have been an absolute roller-coaster ride.

BOLDER, DARKER, SEXIER... AND, AS USUAL...COBALT IS VERY PISSED OFF! 
In the last comic, Cobalt was captured after an unprecedented blood bath of violence and carnage. Exposed and de-hooded, it was revealed that he was indeed the long-lost heir to the throne, much to the celebration of the Radio people. Yet, Cobalt was a terrible king... and felt strapped to the throne of the people he hates.
That’s where the new comic starts. This the first Cobalt 60 comic I have published in years, and the first ever Cobalt 60 animation ever created. This will be the 6th graphic novel in the series, an 80-page story of Cobalt after he bares an heir with Queen BBC and escapes his bondage back into the desert.
 
We've kept it PG-13 for display here on IndieGoGo, but believe me,  the Cobalt 60 Chronicles is chock full of violence, sex, and very bad behavior. It's Cobalt 60 in full effect, and definitely NSFW!
Read about the Bode Legacy, and Cobalt's History at the end of this page.


Cobalt 60 first appearance in Witzend #7, April 1, 1970 by Vaughn BodeWHY INDIEGOGO? WHY NOW?
Independence. This project is near and dear to my heart. We are going to bring Cobalt out the exactly the way it’s supposed to be... Raw... Hard... the way my Dad imagined him. I’m crowdfunding this because it’s an incredible opportunity to connect with you, the fans. You get it. The Cobalt 60 Chronicles is an over-the-top, no-holds-barred tribute to Bode fans old and new.

HOW MUCH ASS WILL COBALT 60 KICK?
In 1967, Cobalt 60 was one of the first comics ever to feature ultra-violence, sex and a bleak look at our future, years ahead of influencing the films by George Miller, Ralph Bakshi, and Roger Corman and thousands of artists worldwide. In 2017, we are going to bring it even harder… More carnage... More sex and lust… More betrayal… More mutants… All brought to life with modern animation techniques, including motion capture and photogrammetry.
PLUS... It’s Cobalt’s 50th Anniversary, so we’ve lined up lots of cool rewards exclusive to this campaign.  We have terrific print sets, truly collectible comics, blasts from the past and other surprises from the Bode archives... Many of them very limited. All of them are authentically rare, and all signed by Bode!

OUR REWARDS!
Think of your pledge as a pre-purchase. We’ve put together a bunch of rewards that we hope you'll love. And any of our rewards make a great gift for the Bode fan in your fam-bam! Check ‘em out! All rewards include FREE domestic (US) shipping! A nominal charge applies to rewards shipped outside of the US.

 
FAN FUND THE COBALT 60 CHRONICLES!
This is your chance to influence the kind of kick ass, take-no-prisoners Cobalt stories you wanna see. I want you to be our financiers. In return, we’ll make a cartoon and graphic novel that we can all be proud of. We believe fan funding is the best way to bring the Cobalt 60 Chronicles to life. This has been a long train coming, and if it wasn't for you, the fans, we would never have made it this far. Now, we need your help to get up this hill!All of the assets have been built for the cartoon, and I have completed 65 of the 80 pages for the graphic novel. We already lined up the crew for finishing the cartoon pilot, the programming team for the Augmented Reality, and the print shop that is going to knock out the books. We are ready to rock through this final stage! We will start shipping rewards immediately upon completion of the campaign.  Thank you so much for helping to make this happen. Please pledge now! If you can’t, that’s cool... But, maybe you can help by sharing on Facebook and Instagram? Got a Bode fan in your life? Let ‘em know! Every little bit helps!

WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?
Every penny raised will go towards making the Cobalt 60 Chronicles a reality. This covers everything... The creative talent, CGI team, stunt and voice performers, Augmented Reality programmers, printing services, supplies, fees and taxes. In other words, everything that it takes to make this happen in time for San Diego Comic-Con this July. We are calling in all our favors, and every one of our talented crew is willing to do whatever it takes to make this happen. This year. Now.
A portion of the money will go to fulfilling all the cool rewards we are offering and a percentage will go to taxes and IndieGoGo fees. Anything over our goal will go towards funding future Cobalt 60 related projects... See our Stretch Goals, below!

MORE COBALT? HELL, YEAH!
The stretch goals are easy… MORE COBALT!!! We are re-telling the entire 50 year saga in 12x10 animated cartoons, interwoven with the new series of graphic novels. The comic and cartoon are intertwined, I guess is the best way to describe it! Some of the tale will play out in the comic, and then pick back up in the next cartoon episode, with the AR bridging the two!
We are also in development on the first Cobalt 60 video game, using assets directly from the cartoon. The game will be available on iOS, Android, and VR-capable PCs running HTC Vive VR goggles.
When all the episodes are finished, we want to release a hardcover COBALT 60 OMNIBUS COLLECTOR'S EDITION, with a Blu-Ray/Digital Copy of the entire 2-hour cartoon, plus the Video Game, and exclusive Cobalt and Queen BBC statue. 
We have some other fun Bode apps on the horizon, as well… Bode Build-A-Broad app, anyone?

 
RISKS & CHALLENGES
Creating a cartoon pilot and an Augmented Reality graphic novel is a challenge, of course. It has taken us two years to get to this point, and whether we achieve our crowdfunding goal or not, the Cobalt 60 Chronicles will get produced. The real challenge is when. We have been doing this ourselves, slowly and out of pocket, but with great love and dedication, and that won't stop no matter what. Sadly, without funding, it will take years to finish.
The good news is, we are nearly done! We have already lined up the crew for finishing the cartoon, the programming team for the Augmented Reality, and the print shop that is going to knock out the books. We are ready to rock through this final stage. With your help, it will be out this summer!
Our goal is to have everything launch at the San Diego Comic-Con this July. Should we not meet our funding goal, that date will be pushed back, but if we hit our goal, you better believe we are gonna deliver! Plus, all of our rewards are standing by to ship. We will begin shipping immediately upon completion of the campaign.
Our production, printer and shipping partners are secured, our budgets are complete, our shipping supplies are ready, and our manpower is lined up. We just gotta ship and get to work so we can finish in time for San Diego.
And regarding rewards fulfillment, I have an extensive publishing background, and I am proud of of my ship on time (or reasonably on time) record (mostly thanks to Molly!). We will make sure all your rewards are delivered as promised, packed securely. We take every phase of our campaign, including shipping, quite seriously. 

THANK YOU SO MUCH!
I’d like to thank all the fans who have supported me over the years. I love meeting you guys at cons, at one of our showings, or on location when I am blasting the bricks. I’d like to thank all the readers and collectors who have supported me, as well as those newcomers to the Bode Worlds! Welcome aboard! 
 
LEGACY: 50 YEARS OF BODE STYLE
 
Vaughn Bode is touted as the very foundation of the hip hop style you see worldwide. The earliest graffiti writers of the NY city subway lines used our characters besides their groundbreaking pieces that started graffiti and the street art movement. Vaughn created such icons as Cheech Wizard, the Bode Lizard, Bode Broads and of course, Cobalt 60.


My fathers’ light in the adult comics scene burned bright in the 60’s and 70’s and like a comet he was gone off to ball the universe, and inspire tens of thousands of artists, movie makers and graffiti writers from the last 50 years. Vaughn created thousands of worlds populated by his unmistakable style and one of a kind characters. I have vigilantly carried on his vision into the mainstream subconscious of Pop Culture.


Vaughn Bodē first drew the character Cobalt 60 on a piece of scratch paper in 1959. Nearly ten years later, in 1968, he published a ten-page, black-and-white, pen-and-ink Cobalt 60 story for Ken Rudolph's sci-fi fanzine Shangri L'Affaires (a.k.a. Shaggy) #73. The story did not expound much on the character, instead concentrating on action and a thorough depiction of the story's setting.
Bodē wrote a prose follow-up of the story, with pencil illustrations, for Shaggy #74. Bodē won the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Fanzine Artist on the strength of Cobalt 60. In addition, the initial ten-page story was later republished in Witzend #7 (April 1970), in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Metal Hurlant in 1980, and in Epic Illustrated #27 (Dec. 1984).

DUST DEVIL: THE COBALT 60 SAGA
 
Cobalt 60 takes place in our post apocalyptic Mad-Max-like future, where man's genius has sterilized our tiny planet, and left a barren wasteland populated with what is left of mankind's dregs… Radio men and women and a plethora of mutant humans and animals deformed by years of exposure to the radioactive desert that is our future.

Cobalt is the heir to the human race. His family is considered the last of the genetic line in which no mutation is present. An evil mutated Prime Minister of Radio City, Strontium 90, assassinated Cobalt’s family in an attempt to wipe out the bloodline. Cobalt’s mother is tipped off before the murderous coup, and casts Cobalt into the desert as a child to be raised by the extradited and outcast mutants… Forced out of Radio City due to Strontium 90’s hatred, bigotry and racism.
Cobalt hides his face, concealing his identity with a hood, and strikes out against his own people to protect and defend his mutant brethren who raised him.
In the last comic, Cobalt was captured after an unprecedented blood bath of violence and carnage. Exposed and de-hooded, it was revealed that he was indeed the long-lost heir to the throne, much to the celebration of the Radio people. Yet, Cobalt was a terrible king... and felt strapped to the throne of the people he hates.

That’s where the new comic starts. This the first Cobalt 60 comic I have published in over 20 years, and the first ever Cobalt 60 animation ever created. This will be the 6th graphic novel in the series, an 80-page story of Cobalt after he bares an heir with Queen BBC and escapes his bondage back into the desert.

<p><strong>Michael Tierney</strong> has been involved in comics and the publishing industry since the 70s. Owner and proprietor of both The Comic Book Store and Collector's Edition, Michael was a Finalist for both the Star*Reach Comics Retailer of the Year Award in 1985 and the Will Eisner Spirit of the Comics Retailer of the Year Award in 1999, has been an Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide Advisor since the 1990s, and is a staple of Central Arkansas' comic scene.  A former journeyman printer and printing division manager, he's written, published, and at times even penciled, inked, and printed his own comics. He is currently writing, lettering, and coloring Edgar Rice Burroughs® Beyond the Farthest StarTM.

Since 2018, however, the Wild Stars universe is in high gear, first with last year's publication of Wild Stars III: Time Warmageddon and now with Wild Stars IV: Wild Stars Rising.</p>
<p>Tierney revisits the roots of the Wild Stars universe while at the same time growing it in this new adventure that takes us back to the fall of Atlantis and the final exodus to the stars 75,000 years ago and to the future where immortals battle on the fringe of a galaxy-destroying black hole!</p>

<h3>Why Crowdfund?</h3>
<p>This Wild Stars 35th Anniversary Edition Set is a HUGE project. We need to raise money for proofs, and to pay our artists to make sure that this can happen!</p>
<p>In today's age of event-releases, it's important to create buzz for new titles. It's not just enough to have a title ready, printed, and dropped live on Amazon. Crowdfunding methods like IndieGoGo and Kickstarter are an integral part of getting the word out about new releases these days.</p>
<p>While we've used Kickstarter in the past to drum up support for the magazine and sell something akin to subscriptions, changes to the POD industry made it a less-than-viable option to sell Cirsova. </p>
<p>In the case of a big project like Wild Stars, however, an IndieGoGo lets us offer several perks ala carte without having to create crazy tiers for combinations of items the way we would through Kickstarter.</p>
<p>In addition to getting Wild Stars Rising ready to go, we're doing additional edits on the new editions of Time Warmageddon and Force Majeure, plus enlarging over 300 pages of comics to create matching editions.</p>
<p>Plus, we'll be getting new art from the incredibly talented Mark Wheatley that will need to be laid out, for interiors and covers, and doing new layouts for old covers... It's a lot of work!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I said, this project is HUGE! </p>
<p>Cirsova Publishing has typically prided itself on having everything ready to go and deliver as soon as the money clears, but with a project this big, we don't want to bite off more than we can chew, so we're giving ourselves a bit of lead-time to finish up.</p>
<p>When Wild Stars III shipped, we turned Michael's comic store into a fulfillment office, and over the course of 7 grueling hours, stuffed nearly 100 boxes with dozens of books, comics, zines, art prints, etc. It was exhausting! And our goal is gonna put us at sending out way more books than that, if we can help it!</p>
<p>A lot of the work is already done. Things are being laid out and finalized, with a few tweaks here and there and just a bit more work to do. What we really need is help to pay for it to make sure that we can keep doing awesome stuff like this! Money from this crowdfund will go towards the finishing touches, proof costs, and defraying art expense.</p>
<p>This time, we are also not offering shipping outside of the US. The sad reality is that with media mail rates, shipping costs jump from a couple bucks for domestic to anywhere from $30 to $60 for outside the US, and we don't want to be caught with our pants down because we guessed wrong on shipping costs.  We do care about our overseas fans and supporters, though, and want to make these items available to you! Unlike the 1st Edition of Time Warmageddon, we plan on keeping these in print and made available through normal distribution channels via Ingram Content or something along those lines. For anything else, hit us up after the crowdfund ends and we will try to work out an accurate quote on shipping and hook you up!</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
Cirsova Publishing is an acclaimed publisher of science fiction and fantasy adventure whose flagship publication, Cirsova Magazine was a 2017 Hugo Awards finalist for Best Semi-Pro Zine.
Cirsova has published a dozen issues since 2016 and in 2019 published Duel Visions, an anthology of weird fiction by Misha Burnett and Louise Sorensen, and an illustrated edition of Leigh Brackett's Eric John Stark stories to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of Queen of the Martian Catacombs appearing in Planet Stories Magazine.
Michael Tierney has been involved in comics and the publishing industry since the 70s. Owner and proprietor of both The Comic Book Store and Collector's Edition, Michael was a Finalist for both the Star*Reach Comics Retailer of the Year Award in 1985 and the Will Eisner Spirit of the Comics Retailer of the Year Award in 1999, has been an Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide Advisor since the 1990s, and is a staple of Central Arkansas' comic scene.  A former journeyman printer and printing division manager, he's written, published, and at times even penciled, inked, and printed his own comics. He is currently writing, lettering, and coloring Edgar Rice Burroughs® Beyond the Farthest StarTM. His best-selling four volume Edgar Rice Burroughs 100 Year Art Chronology published by Chenault & Gray was released in 2018. Michael has been a regular contributor to Cirsova Heroic Fantasy and Science Fiction Magazine and recently published ""Young Tarzan and the Mysterious She"" expanded from a previously ""lost"" fragment by Edgar Rice Burroughs in the new Cirsova Magazine of Thrilling Adventure and Daring Suspense.
Michael Tierney's Wild Stars has been the work of a life-time. Michael has spent years telling the sprawling story of the galactic exodus of the first space-faring race of men before the dawn of history as we know it. He has expanded his world across zines, comic books and novels over the decades. Since 2018, however, the Wild Stars universe is in high gear, first with last year's publication of Wild Stars III: Time Warmageddon and now with Wild Stars IV: Wild Stars Rising.
Tierney revisits the roots of the Wild Stars universe while at the same time growing it in this new adventure that takes us back to the fall of Atlantis and the final exodus to the stars 75,000 years ago and to the future where immortals battle on the fringe of a galaxy-destroying black hole!


35th Anniversary Editions of Wild Stars
Cirsova Publishing is creating an all new standard edition of all previous Wild Stars books that will match the new release, Wild Star Rising.
Wild Stars: Book of Circles collects the early comics, Erlik (WS Vo1 1 #1) and First Marker (WS Vol 2 #1), placed chronologically within the 2001-2002 run of Wild Stars comics (WS Vol 3 #1-7)
Book of Circles tells the story of conflicting timelines and parallel worlds that culminate an alliance between a wolf-like alien race called the Brothan and alternate time-line fascists, the Artomiques, that aims to attack and destroy the earth by launching a comet at Jupiter to ignite it as a second sun. 
These comics feature artwork by Frank Brunner (Doctor Strange, Howard the Duck), David Brewer (Cable, Deadpool), Dave Simons (Ghost Rider), and Michael Tierney, plus the collected editions feature additional painted works by Mary Tierney. 
This new edition of the almost 300 page graphic novel will be printed in Cirsova Magazine's standard 8.5"" x 11"" format, and will fit nicely on the shelf between your collection of Cirsovas and the rest of the 35th Anniversary Wild Stars books.
Wild Stars II: Force Majeure wraps an 83,000 word novel around 38 pages of comics penciled by Armando Gil (Conan the King, Ka-Zar the Savage), along with 50 'flashback' illustrations by Dave Simons.
Seeking revenge for his defeat, Carthage kidnaps the First Marker's infant daughter and absconds with her through time! Erlik and Daestar aid Mark Mackavicka and Akara in their search through time for their missing daughter. Except to preserve the future and prevent a resurgence of the Brothan empire, they can't rescue Mark and Akara's daughter until she's already a grown woman!
This new edition of the novel / comic hybrid will be printed in Cirsova Magazine's standard 8.5"" x 11"" format.
 
Wild Stars III: Time Warmageddon continues the saga of the Wild Stars as former-President Bully Bravo seeks to solve the mysteries of distant suns going missing, only to be replaced by white dwarfs, and newly discovered planets showing the apparent signs of previous human colonization, all while pursued by an evil pirate queen and a rogue time-traveler trying to create a god.
This novella featured cover art by Timothy Lim (My Hero Magademia, Black Hops: USA GI, Street Fighter), and interior illustrations  and two variant covers by Mark Wheatley (Song of Giants: the Poetry of Pulp, The Flash, Blood of the Innocent).
This new edition will reprint this one-time Kickstarter-exclusive edition with new bonus content, including an additional epilogue on the whereabouts of Akara and the First Marker, two stories by Michael Tierney originally published in Cirsova Magazine, and the previously unpublished Wild Stars story, The Grimgrip.
Wild Stars IV: Wild Star Rising is both a prequel and sequel to the previous Wild Stars adventures. Looking back 75,000 years into the past to the last days of Atlantis and the final exodus to the Wild Stars led by the Ancient Warrior, Wild Star Rising unfolds the aeons-long plan to rescue the Ancient Warrior's long-lost beloved, Phaedra, from the heart of a black hole where she was imprisoned by another powerful immortal... A sailor from earth's distant past must join with the Ancient Warrior's Wild Stars companions to help them navigate the great gulfs of space, free Phaedra from her black-hole prison, and stop the extra-dimensional squids that could destroy the universe if they can meet up and mate!
This illustrated novel will be printed in Cirsova Magazine's 8.5"" x 11"" format, matching the previously released Time Warmageddon, the new 35th Anniversary Editions of Book of Circles and Force Majeure, and your collection of Cirsovas! 
This edition will also contain the first-ever extensive bio-glossary of Wild Stars universe, making it a must-have for old and new fans alike!

This Wild Stars 35th Anniversary Edition Set is a HUGE project. We need to raise money for proofs, and to pay our artists to make sure that this can happen!

While we've used Kickstarter in the past to drum up support for the magazine and sell something akin to subscriptions, changes to the POD industry made it a less-than-viable option to sell Cirsova. 
In the case of a big project like Wild Stars, however, an IndieGoGo lets us offer several perks ala carte without having to create crazy tiers for combinations of items the way we would through Kickstarter.

<p>The Rains of Ganymede is primarily a character driven science fiction story with elements of the western outlaw, action and heist stories. It is also a goal of mine to include natural, but depthful world-building to immerse the readers into the world our characters live and breath in. </p>
<p>Over seven thousand years into the future the human race has survived and thrived, ultimately spreading throughout the solar system and harnessing its power. Planets have been terraformed, and in the most extreme of cases, shifted in their orbits making them ideal for human habitation. Earth was mostly vacated 6000 years ago in 'The Great Migration', left to recover from the early scars of humanity.</p>
<p> There are massive sprawling space-stations above Jupiter that house malls, casinos and the greatest attractions to be seen in the new age, and beautiful floating cities in the clouds of Venus. </p>
<p>But there are always things less than glamorous to be found:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564562549/dkfzbexj4nxvkc7tjkqw.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>[Orion and Mr. Matthews]</p>
<p>Ganymede, one of the moons of Jupiter, has become the hub of all of the criminals in the galaxy. A massive prison-moon comprised of five major sections: Two separate bases built for housing soldiers and higher ranking personnel, a prison complex known as 'the Blocks' that sits on top of massive underground mining operation, a max security colony built underground and a massive city for 'freed' prisoners known as 'the Parole Zone'. Everybody whose sentence in the blocks comes to an end makes their way to the parole zone, but from there they can never leave. Instead you live out your life, working and earning enough to get by under the guise of freedom.<br/>Our story follows Leah Morris, a girl born outside of the prison who was brought in at a young age on account of her parent's crimes. At the first opportunity her mother left the blocks for the parole zone, leaving her family behind. Her father who had been forced to work in the mines eventually succumbed to a poisoned lung leaving Leah alone. Before she could be taken and put into general prison populous she escaped with barely more than the clothes on her back.</p>

<h3>What We Need <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565036883/ohyl5ylal83ob5eaoi2o.jpg"" src=""""/>

<p>[Leah Morris and her late father Leon Morris]</p>
<p>My goal for this campaign is $1000. I have started the comic as I have stock left over from other projects I've done, but I am running low and the supplies are expensive. The cover isn't done as I'm missing the supplies I need.</p>
<p>I'm looking specifically for funding to help cover the cost of: Art supplies, the lettering cost and the printing cost. The shipping cost has been added to the indiegogo. If there is any money left over, or in the event the campaign exceeds its goal, the extra money will go towards completing the Rains of Ganymede #2, and making stretch goals for Rains #1. For example a potential variant cover, improving the print quality etc. </p>
<p> To help explain how much I need I'll explain my process. </p>
<p>All of the tools I use are standard in manga making today. I use dip pens (G-pen for the characters, kabura pen for the backgrounds and a small maru pen for tiny detailing) as well as sumi paint brushes, manga grade white out, pilot ink and micron pens for drawing the borders. I use screen-tones to create the grey tones on the page. (I'll provide a description of screen-tones in the step by step explanation of my process) The only difference from my process and many manga artists is I do not draw my own speech bubbles, instead I pay out a letterer (Rob Jones in the UK, great guy) and leave it all to him. </p>
<h3>The Process</h3>
<ol>
<li>I begin obviously with a story idea. I spend as much time as I need figuring out my themes, end goal and characters. When I have everything decided I plot the entire story out in bullet points, which gets me ready for the story-boarding stage.<br/> </li>
<li>The story-board is the rough draft where I really work out the story as I go, and decide dialogue, panel and shot composition etc. I'll include images of the story-boards for the Rains of Ganymede as a reference. It is often in this stage that opportunities for foreshadowing are found, and themes are solidified. I typically do at least two revisions of the story-boards before moving on. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564436280/ctwtkwh180vehzsi6fk2.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>[Page #1 &amp; #2 story-boards]<br/> </li>
<li>After the story-boarding comes the final draft. I begin like most in pencil, laying everything out with near-final detail. Certain shots will change from the story-boards in this stage, and less frequently dialogue will be moved around or edited. All based on improving the page as much as possible.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564436841/eat3byz2wqksvkshzhp6.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>[Partial scan of page #1 of Rains]<br/> </li>
<li> After pencils comes the inks. I ink the characters first and the backgrounds second typically. Pretty standard stuff.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564563482/fb42gdjiyeltwl5efbal.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>[Work in progress of Leah Morris]<br/> </li>
<li>Once I have inked everything, I erase the pencil and the screen-tone stage begins. This is one of the largest parts of the budget for the Rains of Ganymede. For those unaware, a screen-tone is an adhesive plastic film, very comparable to clear tape that has printed patterns on it, all grayscale to add shadow or sky effects etc. Anytime you see gray tones or gray patterns in manga you are looking at a screen-tone. They are roughly 5 dollars for one page of any given pattern, some cheaper, some more expensive. I'll show some examples of what screen-tones look like and how they work here:<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564436886/vzjzhzlcjjrag5gadkdj.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564436902/hb970qkl0bda2kf8wain.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564436943/ecyirvhxad5ffjwew7h7.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>[Top to bottom: SE-105 screen-tone used for Mr. Matthew's skin tone, Mr. Matthews inked, Mr. Matthews with tones.]<br/> </li>
<li>After screen-tones I finalize with whiteout and any extra inking, I correct any lines drawn outside the borders on the computer when I am tuning the black and white values of the scanned image. I'll also add certain effects that are too difficult to do by hand. Though its a goal of mine to do as much of my work traditionally as possible. I love the look and quality of the medium. From there the pages and a script are sent to Rob who adds dialogue and sound effects.</li>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>First and foremost this is my first indiegogo campaign, or crowdfunding campaign in general. I have help with the indiegogo in the form of my roommate, but besides that the story and production of the comic relies entirely upon me, which is a tremendous responsibility. I have never had a published comic before, though I have been submitting my stories to companies.</p>
<p>I may not have done any campaigns before, but this is not my first story. I have been writing for years, the Rains of Ganymede being my 14th project. I have been an artist for over a decade learning how to draw dynamic and distinct characters as well as learning one, two and three point perspective fluently, honing in on a style reminiscent of modern manga artists such as Takehiko Inoue and Takeshi Obata, but still unique to myself and my own artistic vision. In the last four years specifically I have worked very hard to understand the nuances of good storytelling, worldbuilding and character writing and I feel that the Rains of Ganymede is the culmination of all of that knowledge so far. </p>
<p>Another challenge will be the coordination of shipping and managing the perks/rewards. An email has been set up specifically for this indiegogo rains.of.ganymede@gmail.com to field any questions anyone may have. My roommate is assisting in checking the email and organizing the shipping of the comics to those who donate. </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Of course we would always appreciate you sharing the campaign to anyone who might enjoy the comic, and hope that you can help spread some positive words about the Rains of Ganymede. <br/><br/>But overall I want to create stories that will exist much longer than me, that people can love and retell to others, sharing the joy of storytelling. So the biggest way you can help is by supporting and sharing the new stories being written that you love, whether or not my own comic is among them. <br/><br/>Thank you very much!<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564566368/qjpxocrzs4akqsjrucfj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
[Leah Morris in her tunnel-home]
The Rains of Ganymede is primarily a character driven science fiction story with elements of the western outlaw, action and heist stories. It is also a goal of mine to include natural, but depthful world-building to immerse the readers into the world our characters live and breath in. 
Over seven thousand years into the future the human race has survived and thrived, ultimately spreading throughout the solar system and harnessing its power. Planets have been terraformed, and in the most extreme of cases, shifted in their orbits making them ideal for human habitation. Earth was mostly vacated 6000 years ago in 'The Great Migration', left to recover from the early scars of humanity.
 There are massive sprawling space-stations above Jupiter that house malls, casinos and the greatest attractions to be seen in the new age, and beautiful floating cities in the clouds of Venus. 
But there are always things less than glamorous to be found:
[Orion and Mr. Matthews]
Ganymede, one of the moons of Jupiter, has become the hub of all of the criminals in the galaxy. A massive prison-moon comprised of five major sections: Two separate bases built for housing soldiers and higher ranking personnel, a prison complex known as 'the Blocks' that sits on top of massive underground mining operation, a max security colony built underground and a massive city for 'freed' prisoners known as 'the Parole Zone'. Everybody whose sentence in the blocks comes to an end makes their way to the parole zone, but from there they can never leave. Instead you live out your life, working and earning enough to get by under the guise of freedom.Our story follows Leah Morris, a girl born outside of the prison who was brought in at a young age on account of her parent's crimes. At the first opportunity her mother left the blocks for the parole zone, leaving her family behind. Her father who had been forced to work in the mines eventually succumbed to a poisoned lung leaving Leah alone. Before she could be taken and put into general prison populous she escaped with barely more than the clothes on her back.

Stealing away into the sewers of the prison complex, she came upon a small group of others who suffered a similar fate as her. There she found the semblance of a family, but it never filled what Leah was missing.
Here she spent the next several years of her life, growing in age as much as she was growing in restlessness. Her resentment grew as well, for the people that imprisoned her as an innocent child, forced her father to poison himself and reduced her to a squatter in the sewers.
She grew to be more isolated as she aged, her mind set on further places and things.
They had always labeled her a criminal; now she wanted to show them what that truly meant. 
The Rains of Ganymede will follow Leah and a group of innocent, and less than innocent people, all trying to find their way to a life of freedom. They plan to pull a heist to get off the moon, or die trying.
 There are themes of the want for youth rebellion and the consequences of that, with a focus on strong characters and elaborately designed cities and worlds that evoke the feeling of a living and breathing universe.

I will also supply those who contribute The E-Book Edition of Nubara available for Amazon Kindle :) If I do not make this goal this project can & will take up to 3 years to complete by then Nubara wont be fresh on anyone's mind but all three novels will be out.    The Impact: 
Nubara is already doing well but imagine if this reaches epic proportions. Lots of movies have been made from well know Kindle Books.  Do you really want to miss out on such an opportunity?  The E Book is already doing so well, imagine how the print edition will be doing once released. I believe in transparency which is why I am going to give updates when there are some to give.    Risks & Challenges  Finding an illustrator is one thing but life does get in the way which is why I need to find a few illustrators in case one can not fulfill my illustration needs for this graphic novel.  I have been working on Nubara Book 1 for 1 year, I said I was going to do it & I never gave up, I did it now I am working on Book 2 while working on another novel not related to the series. Plus I have a full time job on top of it. I have scarified lots to fulfill my dreams but to also help inspire those who have dreams but think they can not achieve it. YOU CAN.  I will make sue I dedicate myself to this project 100%. A Graphic novel for this series will be a huge achievement.     Other Ways ""You"" Can Help If you can not contribute that is alright, but you can help get the word out there by sharing.   Help my dream of getting this GRAPHIC NOVEL out there into the hands of all.   Share on Social Media, talk about it with your friends!

ART IS A LIEI bet you didn't know that. 

What? Isn't Art about truth, embodied in an idealised beauty, cutting to the core of what it means to be human? Sorry Sister Wendy, but eat your rosary. Alright, it's an elitist, pompous, obscurantist and laughable grab-bag of theories desperately in search of relevance in a relativist world that's long since become deconstructed by post-structuralist, post-modern politically correct left of centre of the right-ness. Roger Scruton sez so. 
Nope. Perhaps it's a place where – to paraphrase Oscar Wilde – people like Sotheby, Christie and Leonard Joel know the price of everything and the value of nothing. At least Lucien Freud's estate can now afford to give all his bastards private education. 

Close, but no cigar. Or whiskey. Okay, it's knowing art when you see it, and that's when you like it, right? 
Sorry, all wrong. Everything you thought you knew about Art is a lie, but don't worry, the guide to true understanding of art is at hand. Carol Wood and Susan Butcher have spent the past nine years digging for the truth in all manner of cemeteries, crypts, tombs, archives, applying only the most relevant forensic techniques: alchemy, reading animal intestines, tea-leaf dialectics, coffee ground metaphysics, watching cartoons, reading comics and saturnalia. 
So with great diligence, skill, laughter and cups of tea, Carol and Sue have written and drawn these exposés:Did you know Picasso only invented Cubism to get girls? Magritte was actually a failed mad scientist? 
That Marcel Duchamp was a serial art criminal: he misappropriated public property, produced pornography, played chess and got people to pay him for it. He was also French. 
Or that Frida Kahlo was really Betty Boop before the accident; Diego knew but Trotsky didn't. 
Butcher and Wood even show you how they make a comic by reanimating John Constable so they can kill him for THEIR art. 
Seriously though, this book collects the strips that have been published under the title Dead Or Alive in Artillery Magazine since 2006. 
In short, I wanted a collection of the strips, and as neither Artillery nor Carol and Sue could produce it, I put my money where my heart is and have published it 'artistically'. This is to say that I've ensured it's the best looking book I could produce, and making money is a secondary consideration. Yes, it has been PRINTED and ready to be shipped. But we will allow time for Carol and Sue to make the other perks that are on offer. For those who are familiar with the Dead or Alive strips, this book also contains five strips never before published, a introduction comic by me, a preface by Amelia Clipart and an index that is itself, mostly lies. Check out the gallery for full page previews!
So, pick up a book and a reward to your fancy to the right. There's the book, but also postcards, posters, novelties, original art, handmade figurines and a one off, hand-made Statue of Libertinism (formerly known as Liberty) before the International Art Restorers sanitised it (as seen in the strip within the book). Some things are better left to age disgracefully. 

G'wan, this is the best art education in comics form you can buy. I know it's the only one, but why quibble on detail.

<h1>The project</h1>
<p><strong>Born To Be Different, Born To Save The World!""</strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://twitter.com/DeptOfAbility"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">#EatMyWheels</a></p>
<p>This gang of Superheroes, use their disabilities as their super powers.</p>
<p>Disabled
 children deserve to be represented in books and on TV in a positive 
way. Without sad music in the background accompanying their story.</p>
<p>Children with disabilities are funny, exciting, happy, sad, mischievious, rude, caring. Just like any other child.</p>
<p>I
 have created the Department Of Ability and am in the process of writing
 a comic, to be released in March 2015. I also hope to get it onto TV, 
so that ALL children, (not just ones with special needs) can watch 
enjoy, relate to, and realise that the child who lives down the street, 
is just the same as them. Just with a difference.</p>
<p>I NEED YOUR HELP!</p>
<b>MY INSPIRATION</b><br/><p>The Department of Ability are Disabled 
Superheroes! I am a very proud father to 9 year old Emily, who has Spina
 Bifida and Hydrocephalus and uses a wheelchair to get around...she is, 
like the kids in the groups we move around in, strong, independent, 
funny and brilliant! However several years ago Emily and I noticed that 
there were no real, strong disabled characters for kids in comics or on 
T.V.....so I made my own. I have created and drawn them. This is all my 
artwork. 
</p>
<h1>
<br/>Who's involved</h1>
<p>With the help of <a href=""http://www.strongbones.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.strongbones.org.uk</a>
 the prospect of a printed Disabled Superhero comic is close! The 
characters and situations are totally accessible for ALL kids, it 
promises to be loud, strong and fun! The demand for this comic from 
parents groups, schools, celebs, and charities WORLDWIDE is such that I 
have had to give up full time employment to finish it and make it 
happen! Of course this means me and my family have to live whilst I 
draw, write and hopefully change the perception and views of our 
disabled kids through the comic, and hopefully TV! </p>
<p>Strongbones 
have been so supportive of this project, I have drawn several of their 
children, with their parent's permission, and included them in the 
story.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444592479/y9523kr78aaijyjxwv7v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Strongbones are paying for the comic to be printed and distributed. 
I'm not being paid at all for creating the comic, but as the comic has 
gotten bigger and bigger from all of the interest I have got, I have had
 to give up my full time job to concerntrate on it. I was the sole 
earner, as my wife is the fulltime carer for Emily. Therefore I haven't 
got any income to support my family. However, my family and I are so 
passionate and believe in the project, we decided it was worth the risk.<p>Since the D.O.A has gone online via FB <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/The-Department-of-Ability"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/The-Department-of-Ability</a> and TWITTER  <a href=""https://twitter.com/DeptOfAbility"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://twitter.com/DeptOfAbility</a>
 the response to the idea has been incredible! From celebs to sportstars
 to charities, the premise and the message behind this has struck a 
chord worldwide! A few famous paralympians have even agreed to appear in
 the final showdown with the bad guys!</p>
<p>Emily and I have had 
various TV/news/magazine appearances, and hundreds of positive comments.
 Take a look at my website for up to date news of what has been 
happening. <a href=""http://www.departmentofability.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.departmentofability.com</a></p>
<p>I
 am working on my own creating this with just a dog for company! The 
strongbones charity are going to print this when I finish it. One day, 
my dream is to turn this comic into an animation for all children able 
bodied and disabled, to enjoy. First I need to finish the comic. I have 
already started drawing and hope to have it finished by the beginning of
 2016. The more time that I can spend on it, the quicker it will be.</p>
<h1>
<br/>How I will use the money raised.</h1>

<br/><h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Strongbones are funding the 
printing and distribution of the comic. They have a set budget. Demand 
for the comic is now so high since all of the publicity we have 
received, more people want it to be available,so they are possibily 
looking into extra funding to increase publication.They are sorting out 
this side. By this time, the comic will be drawn and written, so I will 
have already finished my bit, though I will be helping to promote the 
comic as much as I can. I am also spending a lot of time promoting the 
cartoon, hoping for it to be transformed into a TV series, and have had a
 lot of positive comments about this idea. If the cartoon doesn't 
happen, and I am unable to support myself financially, I will go back to
 my old fulltime job, at a plumbers merchant, knowing that I had tried 
to change conceptions, and a lot of happy children would have seen the 
strongbones comic.</p>

Born To Be Different, Born To Save The World!""
#EatMyWheels
This gang of Superheroes, use their disabilities as their super powers.
Disabled
 children deserve to be represented in books and on TV in a positive 
way. Without sad music in the background accompanying their story.
Children with disabilities are funny, exciting, happy, sad, mischievious, rude, caring. Just like any other child.
I
 have created the Department Of Ability and am in the process of writing
 a comic, to be released in March 2015. I also hope to get it onto TV, 
so that ALL children, (not just ones with special needs) can watch 
enjoy, relate to, and realise that the child who lives down the street, 
is just the same as them. Just with a difference.
I NEED YOUR HELP!
MY INSPIRATIONThe Department of Ability are Disabled 
Superheroes! I am a very proud father to 9 year old Emily, who has Spina
 Bifida and Hydrocephalus and uses a wheelchair to get around...she is, 
like the kids in the groups we move around in, strong, independent, 
funny and brilliant! However several years ago Emily and I noticed that 
there were no real, strong disabled characters for kids in comics or on 
T.V.....so I made my own. I have created and drawn them. This is all my 
artwork. 


Who's involved
With the help of www.strongbones.org.uk
 the prospect of a printed Disabled Superhero comic is close! The 
characters and situations are totally accessible for ALL kids, it 
promises to be loud, strong and fun! The demand for this comic from 
parents groups, schools, celebs, and charities WORLDWIDE is such that I 
have had to give up full time employment to finish it and make it 
happen! Of course this means me and my family have to live whilst I 
draw, write and hopefully change the perception and views of our 
disabled kids through the comic, and hopefully TV! 
Strongbones 
have been so supportive of this project, I have drawn several of their 
children, with their parent's permission, and included them in the 
story.

Strongbones are paying for the comic to be printed and distributed. 
I'm not being paid at all for creating the comic, but as the comic has 
gotten bigger and bigger from all of the interest I have got, I have had
 to give up my full time job to concerntrate on it. I was the sole 
earner, as my wife is the fulltime carer for Emily. Therefore I haven't 
got any income to support my family. However, my family and I are so 
passionate and believe in the project, we decided it was worth the risk.Since the D.O.A has gone online via FB www.facebook.com/The-Department-of-Ability and TWITTER  https://twitter.com/DeptOfAbility
 the response to the idea has been incredible! From celebs to sportstars
 to charities, the premise and the message behind this has struck a 
chord worldwide! A few famous paralympians have even agreed to appear in
 the final showdown with the bad guys!
Emily and I have had 
various TV/news/magazine appearances, and hundreds of positive comments.
 Take a look at my website for up to date news of what has been 
happening. www.departmentofability.com
I
 am working on my own creating this with just a dog for company! The 
strongbones charity are going to print this when I finish it. One day, 
my dream is to turn this comic into an animation for all children able 
bodied and disabled, to enjoy. First I need to finish the comic. I have 
already started drawing and hope to have it finished by the beginning of
 2016. The more time that I can spend on it, the quicker it will be.

How I will use the money raised.
The money raised will 
support me whilst I am at home drawing the comic. Previously I have tried to raise crowdfunding for a block funding, which has been unsuccessful. This time, I will be raising money bit by bit. This will allow me to relax about money, whilst I am beavering away at the comic. The will also help towards 
paying travel expenses for the charity event's, promotions and interviews that I 
have been invited to attend.I have already attended a lot, which has I have managed to pay the cost. However it's now getting really expensive as the project is becoming more and more popular. 
It will mean that I can still pay our morgage, and we will not risk losing our home.
The
 Department Of Ability is such an exciting project for anyone to be 
involved in. It will put a smile on thousands of children's faces, 
especially Emily's!


This project is so important for so many children and families living with disability. Thank you

LAIR tells the story of a faithless, off-duty New York City cop, in a rocky relationship, who gets more than what he bargained for when he somehow finds himself squaring off against a sadistic ruler to a hellish dimension.
If you're into creepily bizarre Stephen King movies, then you'll feel right at home with LAIR!

 



 

 

 

 



LAIR is a 66-page horror one-shot (printed with a ""softbound"" cover) unlike anything you've ever read from an emerging indie comic book writer


ANGELO - Brash off-duty cop who wears his heart on his sleeve.

VAYE - Snarky college student obsessed with Twitter, obscure vintage rock bands and gossip.

LIZZY - Mild-mannered graveyard shift doctor and single mother.

ANASTASIA - Caring woman of faith who found her way into the stubborn arms of Angelo.

<p><strong>Editing and lettering is done for Infidel issue #1 Nuklear fans!<br/><br/>Working on covers and then off to the presses!</strong><br/><br/><br/><u><strong>Who We Are at Nuklear Comix!</strong></u></p>
<p>Nuklear Comix Universe is an independently owned, self-publishing comic house that is looking to bring our stories and characters out to the wider world! The NCU is the brainchild of US Army veteran Barry Edwards. Barry is a lifelong fan of comics and previously owned and operated Nuklear Comix Shop in Sumter, South Carolina. He is the creative mastermind providing initial character designs, story outlines, and the grand scheme of the larger, overarching Nuklear Comix Universe. Together with his lead writer Steven Staggs and lead artist Gene Magora, Mr. Edwards has assembled a mighty team of creative talent to help bring his vision out of his brain and into your hands.</p>
<p>The main focus of this IndieGogo Campaign is to help our creative team secure the funds we need to bring our first issue and promo materials to print so we can proceed with sales and move forward on the next issue of our launch title, INFIDEL!</p>
<p>Infidel is the story of a soldier, wounded and captured in Iraq and now back home in an America he no longer recognizes. Fueled by anger and an urgent call for justice, Infidel will stop at nothing to achieve his goals and dole out the justice he believes is sorely missed in the world.</p>
<p>The funds we seek are primarily for printing costs. Mr. Edwards is a family man and a veteran who works full-time as a construction super-intendent. So far all of the funds used to pay for the materials, scripts, and art produced have been coming straight from his own pockets and now he is seeking help to supplement production costs!</p>
<p>This campaign isn’t just in support of a single issue going to print, it is also a clarion call for all comic book fans and readers to get onboard and see the passion and talent behind this series. A successful funding campaign here means not only a successful print for our first issue, it also means establishing a firm foundation and a place in our expanding fanbase to help ensure the future of the Nuklear Comix Universe is a bright and long-lasting one!</p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>To keep is simple, we need funds to take this first issue to print! Our modest goal of $2000 will all be going into covering the printing and binding costs for copies of the first issue as well as promo materials and branded merchandise such as posters and limited card prints! Even if we don’t reach our ultimate goal, every penny raised from this campaign will be going straight to the printing house to get this book out into the world as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Of course, we appreciate any and all efforts to support this dream and so our campaign will have THREE reward tiers for monetary donations!</p>
<p><strong>Reward Tier 1</strong> – Free Digital Issue!<br/>$10 USD</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reward Tier 2</strong>– Signed First Issue!<br/>$15 USD</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reward Tier 3</strong>– Full-Color Limited Card Print and Signed First Issue!<br/>$30</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></p>
<p>Your contribution, even the smallest amount, will help achieve not only the print run of this first issue, but it will also assist in accomplishing a life-long dream for our creative team. Barry Edwards, former comic shop owner knows the in’s and outs of the business. He has contacts in the local state-wide market in the form of other creatives, shop owners, con organizers, and local persons of importance. He’s not just interested in the creative side, he has a firm grasp on the business handling and how best to get our product out there.</p>
<p>Steven Staggs is a lifelong fan of all things comic book or superhero related. He received a degree in Creative Writing, has scripted a successful short horror film, writes every script and layout for every issue based on creative notes and suggestions, and dreams of seeing his name printed on the cover of a book people will love.</p>
<p>Gene Magora is an incredibly accomplished artist with a pedigree and track record a mile long. He has worked in the past on a wide array of comics, animation, and art projects. The man’s Instagram account is a polished, professional gallery of impeccable skill and he’s eager to prove himself further in our future issues.</p>
<p> You are not just contributing to the printing of a single issue. You are launching a universe fueling the accomplishment of dreams!</p>
<p><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>Self-publishing is always a challenge and in the current health and political climate of the world, its harder than ever to gather together to promote, produce, and complete publishing goals and book sales. We hear at Nuklear Comix are stepping up because we believe the tale we are telling through the eyes of this character is an important one that is more relevant than ever in these trying and shocking times. We are taking the risk and accepting the challenges because we BELIEVE in this world we’ve created, and we hope you will too!</p>
<p><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></p>
<p>Money is important, but it isn’t everything! If you can’t provide support financially but you are still interested or passionate about the stories we want to tell, you can still provide support by spreading the word! We have active pages on Facebook and Instagram as well as a twitter account! Give us a like, share, and follow to keep up to date on the status of the book, future projects, and everything else going on in the Nuklear Comix Universe! We have major plans and big surprises planned over the next year and we would love to see your vocal support!

<h3>Who am I, the team involved, and what Icepick is.</h3>
<p>Todd Rayner - The Creator, writer, and artist for Icepick. I have worked on several independent comics as a digital colorist for Enterlight Studios, Arcana, Wave Entertainment, and Bluewater Productions.</p>
<p>Cover artists for this issue:</p>
<p>Todd Rayner - Standard Cover A</p>
<p>Damon Anthis - Variant Cover B</p>
<p>Icepick is a character whose story I have wanted to publish since I was a kid. Over the years I have revised and cleaned up the story to make it something more than just a kid wanting to make a comic book. It all started with issue 1, which I painstakingly funded and published myself. </p>
<p>With your help I can publish issue 3 and also get out there to meet you the fans!</p>
<h3>Why Crowd Funding?</h3>
<p>There’s no middlemen. It's just you and me. The best thing about Icepick is that most of the creative work on the book is complete. I plan to start shipping the rewards within eight to ten weeks of closing this campaign. Without the middleman I can include various reward tiers, such as the variant cover, stickers, prints, sketch cards, and more!</p>
<p>​With your help I can produce many more covers, issues, and be able to get to a convention near you with all these awesome books. Every penny raised goes towards making Issue 3 of Icepick a reality. That covers everything from the creative side, printing, supplies, taxes, and fees. In other words, everything that it takes to make this happen is where the bulk of the money is going! All profits will go toward funding future stories and making sure I am at shows meeting and greeting you, the fans! </p>
<p>Think of your pledge as a sneak peek or a pre-purchase. I’ve put together several rewards that I hope you'll love. Plus any of the rewards make a great gift for anyone in your family!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>When it comes to shipping on time and reward fulfillment, any project can have obstacles. Most of the perks (including possible Stretch Goal incentives) are standing by ready to print, as most of the creative work is complete. My printers are ready to go as soon as I give them the word! I have worked with these printers before and they deliver the top notch books and rewards you’ll be receiving, this you can count on. If there are any hiccups or delays I will be in constant communication with all backers during the entire process and update you in a timely manner.</p>
<p>I want to assure you that my top priority is making the best and highest quality products possible and having them delivered to you in a timely and undamaged manner. </p>
<p>In conclusion, I’d like to thank all the readers, fans, and any collectors who have supported me over the last year. You’re the reason I keep going and you have been AMAZING!</p>

</div></div>","Hi,
I'm a writer/artist based in Manchester UK. I'm also an actor and playwright. A few years ago I created my own comic book series. With the help of a small independent company, I published a pilot issue, and now I would like to continue the story in a 100 page graphic novel. My aim is to create an entertaining and thought-provoking comic book series, which I will also be pitching as a television series and/or feature film. 
Two of my all-time acting heroes appear as major characters in Borderliners (after granting me permission). Knights of the realm, and living legends, Sir Roger Moore and Sir Ian McKellen!

‘BORDERLINERS: True Realities’ is a fast-moving
21st century espionage tale with more than a nod to TV’s 'The Prisoner', ‘Spooks’, and the Jason Bourne movie
franchise, not to mention the mind-bending sci-fi stories of Philip K Dick (‘Blade Runner’, ‘Total
Recall’, ‘Minority Report’, etc.), and the mind-blowing world of quantum
physics. The grittily realistic graphic novel finds double-crossed government
agents fighting to recover their sanity, and hit back against a corrupt
department of M.I.5., whilst uncovering an incredible multi-universe spanning
conspiracy. 

I have wanted to draw comic books since I was a kid growing up in Wigan, and over the past couple of decades I have had illustration work published in newspapers, magazines, and on television. But my dream has always been to create my own comic book series, and (hopefully) one day adapt it for tv or film. When I did the Borderliners pilot comic, I sent it out to some industry professionals, and was overwhelmed by the response. Here's what they said:
DEZ SKINN, legendary
Marvel UK Comics editor, (second-in-command
to Marvel Comics supremo STAN LEE),
and creator of ‘Dr Who Magazine’, ‘Starburst’, and ‘House of Hammer’ read the
comic:
“..In
Brian’s case, I can’t wait for his second, third, and every issue of Borderliners that follows. It delivers a
totally engrossing storyline enhanced by an admirable art style. Bring it
on, Brian!”
Multi
award-winning ‘Judge Dredd’, ‘Batman’, and ‘Luther Arkwright’ writer/artist BRYAN TALBOT (winner of the 2012 Costa
biography award) said:
“..I’ve
seen your work develop over many years, and you’ve now achieved a new level of confidence and visual
flair”.
And
LIAM SHARP (artist on Marvel’s
‘X-Men’) commented:
“The
effort that’s gone into this is clear on every page. It’s a joy to read something that doesn’t treat the
reader like an idiot.”
MIKE COLLINS, artist on
Dr Who Magazine, Spider-Man, etc., agreed:
“It
has a confident feel to the structure and dialogue – a sense you know where you’re going, and I’m keen to be
along for the ride. I want to know what happens next! And that’s
more than I can say about most mainstream stuff these days!”
What I need is enough pennies to keep me going for approximately 10 weeks of writing/drawing. I'm not greedy, so at £5 an hour (working 8 hours a day/5 days a week), that'd be £2000 in total. I will be publishing the book with a small independent company, so there will be an absolute minimum to be spent on admin/costs, etc. I will also buy all the paper, pens, ink, etc. I need.
Unique perks include:
Your name in the 'Thanks to' section of the book.
Copies of the book.
Invitation to the book launch/party.
Your likeness as a character in the book.
Special limited edition art prints.
Original pages of artwork.
Specially commissioned portraits.

If I don't reach the entire funding, I simply work faster for longer!

I am 100% confident that 'Borderliners' will be a success. With YOUR help, we can make it.

Astrology, which was approved by the USPTO, last June 6th, 2014.  I am in the throws of a small legal
battle after being approved by the United States Patent and Trademark
Office.  A woman with a dissimilar
mark has being suing me, to stop the use of Sexy Astrology—the name of my
YouTube astrology show.  She also
sent me a cease and desist letter. 
We are nearing the end of the argument, and god willing she will
settle.  Namely I will most likely
write a statement saying:  “I will
not ever use my trade mark SEXY ASTROLOGY to do compatibility readings or
matchmaking between couples. And that SEXY ASTROLOGY is a straight astrology
show for entertainment purposes only.” 
It’s really a show about the astrological weather.</p>
<p>Last July 2014 when I began my first indiegogo campaign I
successfully raised about 1700.00$ in just 6 days. I was moving to Ithaca for
the year and was so happy for the turnout!  Thank you for your continued support.  A second indiegogo campaign in the spring 2015 yielded similar results!<br/></p>
<p>I have been practicing doing monthly horoscopes for 7 years
through my youtube comedy channel called SEXY ASTROLOGY.  No, I do not think I am sexy, but in
the world of astrology the two words are easy to remember. And being that the
show is grounded in comedy, my then husband and I came up with the idea after I
had my 3rd child and the result was a small smash!  I have over 2 million video views and being that astrology
is a topic which many take way too seriously—or  people just don't believe in it at all—I  thought how can I sell my advice
better?  Make it SEXY, but the
bottom line is keeping it simple only offer one or two simple ideas &amp; keep
it funny so people keep coming back! 
I love helping people build self esteem &amp; trust in themselves all
while having a good laugh.  It's a
self-help show, with a bent on comedy and art...Astrology is one of those
topics, that needs to be televised...</p>
<p>The reason I am interested in keeping my Trade Mark is that
in the last year someone else started using the term ""Sexy Astrology""
with their column. I thought, ""oh no... guess I'll apply for a trade
mark.”  The United State Patent
andTrademark Office approved it as of June 6, 2014.  I am so excited! However I did not expect someone to file a
notice of Opposition, and Cease and Desist letter, turning this into a federal
case.  With a little more support (6000.00) I can successfully defend my mark, my lawyer is doing an excellent
job so far.  I have a strong case
and over the years, 400 pages of notes, from my monthly readings and a VERY
different product from the person who is trying to take it down.  Intellectual property is important to
all of us!  If I am able to secure
my trademark I will be able to continue to use the name Sexy Astrology for my
show, with out worrying if someone else will be capitalizing on my hard
work.  And who knows? Possibly
obtain a slot on CNN, for a season or two, Ok Cable Access, maybe the History
Channel? O?  Bio?  As well I will be coming out with the
Sexy Astrology T shirt and if all goes well there will be the coffee cup and
tote!</p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>CBA (formerly known as C’est Bon Anthology) has been around for more than a decade, publishing lots of great comics that move far outside of the commercial mainstream.  Over the years, CBA has featured comics by great artists like Anke Feuchtenberger, Olivier Schrauwen, David Mack, Mari Ahokoivu, Kolbeinn Karlsson and many more.</p>
<p>Since the beginning, the people behind CBA are C'est Bon Kultur (CBK), an association of art comics enthusiasts and creators based in Malmö, Sweden. We strive to publish comics that otherwise would be hard to find. Comics that bring something more than what appeals to the lowest common denominator, that challenge the notion of what comics storytelling can or should be.</p>
<p>Now the anthology has fallen on hard times (long story, you can read it at our <a href=""http://cbkcomics.com/2017/04/09/the-story-behind-the-crowdfunding-decision/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>), but that shouldn’t stop us from publishing fantastic art comics, right? That is why we’re asking for your help!</p>
<p>We’re looking for donations to cover the costs of printing and distribution of our upcoming anthology, CBA vol 38|39: Fragments.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's in Fragments?</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>The volume features comics by Marie Jacotey-Voyatzis, Martin López Lam, Stefan Petrini, Rakel Stammer, Diego Shim, Henrik Rogowski, Victor Expolio, Insulina Kid and Gonzalo de las Heras; and texts by Mattias Elftorp and Saskia Gullstrand with Johanna Rojola; in a more-than-a-hundred colorful pages issue. Both the cover and the issue is compiled by Christina Cromnow, one of the main members of the association who's currently working on her debut graphic novel.</p>

</div></div>","Home to the all-new Dark Threads Universe, Smart Whimsy is an independent comic publisher committed to bringing our readers only the most compelling stories driven by rich, dynamic characters. The industry is rapidly changing, and as we enter a new era for comic books, we aim to lead the way with a renewed focus on character development and story. This is a chance to build a better comic book industry, and we intend to be part of this exciting adventure.
The Dark Threads Universe will debut with our 90 page graphic novel, Dark Threads: Surfgirl. It will introduce a number of characters and lay the groundwork for the expanded universe.

The year is 43 SE.
The Year is 43 SE It has been 43 years since the event that changed everything. An exotic particle ribbon swept out of deep space, irradiated the planet, and killed millions. A few of the survivors were changed, developing superpowers. They would become known as Suprahumans; a new species.
Humanity is, once again, not alone.
Following the Border Wall Bombings, the country is on edge. When cult hero, and Suprahuman vigilante, Sparrowhawk is arrested by the Suprahuman Tactical Action Command, protest break out in the streets of New Grimm City. Meanwhile, across the country, a crashed spaceship starts a runaway forest fire that threatens to kill thousands. Lanmé Noel is the latest descendent in a line a women granted the power of the loa La Sirene; the Haitian goddess of the sea. 
While wearing the veve of La Sirene, Lanmé is able to draw on extra-dimensional energies giving her the power to control water and the weather. With the help of her friends Kenji Normura and Kimberly Walker, she adopted the superhero persona of Surfgirl to fight crime. But, the world was less than welcoming.
Now, with a fire threatening to destroy her home, she must face her destiny.

<p>Like most rational sentient beings (such as yourself), I love classic Golden Age Hollywood comedy teams.  And when I was able to work with Biffle &amp; Shooster a few years ago, I thought that they’d be just as funny in comic books as they are on the Silver Screen – just like the 3 Stooges, Dean Martin &amp; Jerry Lewis, and Abbott &amp; Costello (not to mention those great film/comic book stars Bob Hope and Phil Silvers)!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Luckily, Benny Biffle and Sammy Shooster agreed.  So I became their editor and a deal was struck with the great Mike Kazaleh to be their comic book artist and writer.  You know Mike from all those Simpsons, Ren &amp; Stimpy, Captain Jack, Mighty Mouse, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle comic books!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mike was actually on the set in Hollywood while the boys were filming one of their classics, “The Bride of Finklestein”, so he had a head start:  He already knew which guy was Biffle (“the funny one”, who a lotta people say looks like the Broadway star Nick Santa Maria) and which guy was Shooster (“the other one”, who a lotta people say looks like me, the cartoon and radio voice guy).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And now, after years in the making, the FIRST BIG ISSUE is finally ready to ship - and it coincides with the Kino-Lorber Films DVD release of Biffle &amp; Shooster classics and rarities!  The first issue of “The Adventures of Biffle &amp; Shooster” is 28 big pages of cool art (featuring the epic saga of Biffle &amp; Shooster entering the sub-atomic particles of an onion bagel), with a smattering of text and photos, a personal message from Benny and Sammy to You the Reader, and more.  And the interior pages are all in genuine black and white, just like most of Biffle &amp; Shooster’s movies! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mike Kazaleh and I have already started working on the second issue – with some major surprise guest artists!  But we won’t publish the second Biffle &amp; Shooster comic until we’re sure the first issue is a hit with the fans - of comic books, of classic comedy teams, of swell comic art and writing, or of just plain wacky ideas.  The proceeds from sales of the first issue will go towards the next issue – and, if all goes very well, towards the issue after that!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If all this sounds like your cup of ambrosia, please join our campaign and help keep the presses rolling!  Let’s keep seein’ Biffle &amp; Shooster in the Funny Pages, as well as on the Silver Screen!  And “Thank You in Advance” for your kind participation in this delirious enterprise!</p>

Mike Kazaleh and I have already started working on the second issue – with some major surprise guest artists!  But we won’t publish the second Biffle & Shooster comic until we’re sure the first issue is a hit with the fans - of comic books, of classic comedy teams, of swell comic art and writing, or of just plain wacky ideas.  The proceeds from sales of the first issue will go towards the next issue – and, if all goes very well, towards the issue after that!
 
If all this sounds like your cup of ambrosia, please join our campaign and help keep the presses rolling!  Let’s keep seein’ Biffle & Shooster in the Funny Pages, as well as on the Silver Screen!  And “Thank You in Advance” for your kind participation in this delirious enterprise!
