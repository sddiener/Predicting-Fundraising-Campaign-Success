<p><strong>Why it's Important?</strong></p>

<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Brian (Perry Gratton) and Morgan (Evan Hall) have become separated following the invasion of the zombie hordes. They find themselves alone, and frantically trying to survive. Brian heads north to seek refuge from the undead in Canada’s cold climes, while Morgan heads south, or so he thinks. As the story unfolds through the notes they write to each other, we see two different people coming to terms with this terrible event in their own desperate way.</span><br/><br/><p>We are BrainPile Productions, a new theatre company in Edmonton, Alberta. We came together to produce the world premiere of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Notes from a Zombie Apocalypse</span> for the 30th Annual Edmonton International Fringe Festival. The script originated as a collection of poems created by Brian Trimboli and Megan Moriarty, two MFA candidates living on different ends of the United States.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Evan and Perry are students of the Bachelor of Fine Arts Acting program at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta. The program is a conservatory acting program that accepts only twelve students a year, and spans the course of three years. They had both appeared in other Fringe productions, and sought to become more involved in the process of developing, producing, and showcasing their own work. Through a serendipitous series of events, they were introduced to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Notes from a Zombie Apocalypse</span>, and quickly fell in love with the story. The collection was not originally intended to be performed, but the writers were more than happy having the collective adapt and perform the piece. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Evan and Perry approached their mutual colleague and friend Jamie Cavanagh, an Edmonton based actor/improviser and fellow BFA Acting graduate to direct the work, and Brainpile Productions was born. The Collective then asked Lisa Dalmazzi, American-born and Canadian-trained Designer/ Stage Manager to collaborate on the production and the team was complete. As Director, Jamie's desire was (and remains) to keep the writing as-is, with minimal changes to the script in order to suit the stage, but to keep the letter format of the work intact.</p>

It includes more than 200 acts.</p>

<p>We intend to have a

<p><br/></p>Regardless of our financial support, we

We would like to spread the word about our production to as many different groups of people as possible. Our success with the performance is only one of the possible positive outcomes of this venture with IndieGoGo - there is the opportunity to introduce our company to the wider world, which would be unable to see the production. The possibility of filming our opening performance and presenting it to our larger investors means we can not only reward their financial support, but we can break through to markets otherwise restricted to the theatre industry.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Impact

As emerging female theatre artists in New York City, we are trying to make a presence for ourselves in an industry dominated by male playwrights, directors, and producers.  We feel that the best way to do this is by taking matters into our own hands and self-producing in order to get our work up on stage and seen by the New York theatre community.  FringeNYC is an incredible opportunity for us to do so - but we need your help!  Not only must we shell out thousands for rehearsal space, marketing, and more, we also believe in the significance of paying our artists - our actors, designers, and production team - who often find themselves working for free.

First and foremost, your support buys us the most difficult commodity to come by in New York- space.  Rehearsal space is an expensive and unavoidable expense.  Your donations also help us build the show from the ground up, literally - the fire escape, the fish tank, the Little Mermaid T-shirt.  They help give us the chance to market this show until our fingers bleed from Facebook-ing and addressing postcards.  And last but not least, your support allows us to offer stipends to our actors and designers who will be putting in hours and hours of their time and hard work into this play.$10 pays for an hour of rehearsal space$100 covers preliminary printing costs of scripts for the cast and crew$1,000 pays three design team members for their creative services
Other Ways You Can Help

It's not only your donations that make a difference, but your support as we set out on this creative endeavor.  Every friend you tell, every e-mail you send, every tweet, status update, text message, “like” on Facebook, and note to a co-worker - every little bit helps us spread the word and garner more support to realize this production of All the Windows On Alcatraz.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><em>Left of Centre</em> is seeking generous donations for a production of Jon Hartmere and Damon Intrabartolo’s musical, <em>bare</em>. With enough funding from donations, <em>Left of Centre</em> can produce and run <em>bare</em> in the heart of downtown Halifax, at the Neptune Studio Theatre, for the duration of <em>Halifax Pride</em>. Our show will run July 24<sup>th</sup> - 29<sup>th</sup>, with performances starting at 8:00pm each night. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Almost 2,5 years ago Marc and Kevin got excited about adapting Mark TwainÂ´s ""The diaries of Adam and Eve"" for a stage musical. WeÂ´ve been working on this since then, did several rewrites, a workshop, readings and now we want to get it out there!</p>
<p>Marc is a brilliant composer who has been a leading-singer in various German musical productions and is now moving to new horizons as a composer and also vocal coach. Kevin who originally also started out as a musical theatre actor has been translating a bunch of famous Broadway shows like Sound of Music or Sister Act for German productions and is now trying to establish himself as an original lyricist and bookwriter.</p>
<p>""The diaries of Adam and Eve"" tells the story of Adam and Eve stuck in the conflict of GodÂ´s creation and Darwinism. A very ironic but at the same time dearly honest view on men, women and life. AdamÂ´s struggle to protect Eden from ""this new creature with the long hair"" ends with one of the greatest lines Twain has written: ""Wheresoever she was, there was Eden""  </p>
<p>We are producing it ourselves here in Berlin because we believe that this piece could become something extraordinary and we donÂ´t want to give our little precious to just any theatre in ""Posemuckel an der Knatter"" ;-)We got producers and theatres interested but we have to put the show on stage to really convince them.</p>
<p>And thatÂ´s what we need you for!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So musical theatre in Germany? Yes we are doing musical theatre here but rarely original... rarely comedy... The amazing national German funding system is not so amazing anymore when it comes to so called ""entertaining theatre"". ItÂ´s hard to get any funding at all no matter the quality of the piece or having ""Mark Twain"" on your credit list. Even private institutions are rarely interested if itÂ´s not ""real art"" or big enough to get them a good deal of PR.</p>
<p>We were lucky to have a private institution that was going to support our production but 2 weeks ago we got the message that they were admonished to not give funding to any kind of project that is not ""serving the public good/non-profit""</p>
<p>So the money we were expecting is missing now and if we really cut it out of our budget it will be hard to achieve the artistic standard we are aiming for to convince potential producers, especially in terms of set and costumes. It will also push the personal risk of our investment to a level which could make us quite nervous during rehearsal when we would love to focus on the show. So we have two choices: cut set and costumes or spent even more money than we already do which we hardly can...</p>
<p>Or we have a third: Convince you!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>We wonÂ´t make any profit with the Berlin production at all. We are even expecting to face some losses but thatÂ´s fine. ItÂ´s an investment for things to come, so we are kind of the midwife for our own baby!</div>
<div>Please help us to raise the 7500$ we are missing now and support us in producing the show we envisioned. On a budget like that $7500 less really hurt! If you like to know more please send an email to kevin@adam-eva-musical.de and we are happy to give you more details about our budget and where the 7500$ come from.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The opening on 3rd of March at Admiralspalast, Berlin will happen, we canÂ´t go back now. But please help us to get it done as it was originally conceived. In exchange for your contribution, you will receive our special perks listed in the sidebar, as well as our promise to get this heartfelt comedy out to the world. No matter where you are, if in the U.S., Brazil, Japan or Israel, we would love to have the chance to bring it to your country and see international versions!</div>
<div>We have brilliant artistic team, two fantastic actors and chance to create something that might have an important impact on how German musical theatre is perceived. We know itÂ´s just musical theatre but what else is serving ""the puclic good"" better than an evening of laughter and truthfulness?</div>

</div><p><b>WHO ARE WE AND WHAT ARE WE DOING</b></p><p><b>Original Practice Shakespeare Festival</b></p><p>OPS Fest is a team of performers united by two things: our love of Shakespeare's plays and our willingness to be part of a dangerous experiment. ""Original Practice,"" or <i>OP</i> is a technique as well as a goal. We strive to recreate the original conditions in which these plays were produced to best illuminate the drama and historic details surrounding the world's greatest English-language writer.</p><p>We believe the plays were performed unrehearsed and without a director, which means even with the help of some unique theatrical skills and features, things often go weird, or scary, often funny, and sometimes very, very wrong. And our audiences love it! We're entering our seventh summer and we are so proud and grateful for the Portland summer Shakespeare fans who have been gathering by the hundreds to sit in the hot sun or the rain and mud to heckle us. <b>THANK YOU, PORTLAND!!</b></p><p><b>Laurelhurst Festival - The OPS Fest Challenge</b></p><p>Each year, as the company has developed, we've added new titles to our summer touring calendar, and each year, we celebrate our new record in a Laurelhurst Festival, mounting each of the shows in our repertoire once, all in one place, one after another. It's the peak of our season, a huge chunk of our summer performances, and it takes place in beautiful and beloved Laurelhurst Park in SE Portland, so it's lots of fun for the neighbors.</p><p>Initially we added one new comedy a year, then expanded to one comedy and one tragedy. This summer brings a total of eleven different plays to our season, and Laurelhurst Festival 2015 will span two weekends, Thursday, July 23 - Sunday August 2. (Our poor apprentices even have a three-show-day to look forward to!) We hope to eventually test our mettle, muscle, and memories against the model of the 16th century masters, whose schedule regularly involved producing six different plays in six days, or seasons consisting of 26 performances of 16 different plays, a couple of which would be premieres!</p><p><b>Become a Patron of the New Old Arts</b></p><p>Please support our efforts by making a monetary gift towards our Laurelhurst Festival. As fascinating as it is to run into the same limiting factors as our predecessors - the original Original Practicioners - we are not solely conducting the <i>OP</i> experiment as an exercise. Our performers do step into the shoes of 16th century professionals and walk miles in them all summer long, so we are less excited about exploring how they struggled with their model than where it succeeds in 21st century Portland.</p><p>Read further to learn more about supporting our festival, what it means to OPS, and what we have to offer your community. Or, if you're ready to give, check out the sidebar to the right of your screen and find a level of giving that matches your means and your corresponding gift!</p><p><b>THE DEAL</b></p><p><b>What We Need...</b></p><p>Our shows are always free, so we depend on audience donations to cover costs, plus grants and the support of schools and a few private theatre patrons. The base rate for actors to cast this years Laurelhurst Festival alone will cost approximately $3,000!</p><p>We humbly request the support of those in our community with the means to <b>help us raise $3,000</b> - a substantial portion of our operating budget, symbolic of mounting the Laurelhurst Festival. As catchy as it sounds to ask you to ""Pay an actor's salary!"" this year, our success in this season's campaign will determine our operating budget for next year's festival.

""Original Practice,"" or OP is a technique as well as a goal. We strive to recreate the original conditions in which these plays were produced to best illuminate the drama and historic details surrounding the world's greatest English-language writer.We believe the plays were performed unrehearsed and without a director, which means even with the help of some unique theatrical skills and features, things often go weird, or scary, often funny, and sometimes very, very wrong. And our audiences love it! We're entering our seventh summer and we are so proud and grateful for the Portland summer Shakespeare fans who have been gathering by the hundreds to sit in the hot sun or the rain and mud to heckle us. THANK YOU, PORTLAND!!Laurelhurst Festival - The OPS Fest ChallengeEach year, as the company has developed, we've added new titles to our summer touring calendar, and each year, we celebrate our new record in a Laurelhurst Festival, mounting each of the shows in our repertoire once, all in one place, one after another. It's the peak of our season, a huge chunk of our summer performances, and it takes place in beautiful and beloved Laurelhurst Park in SE Portland, so it's lots of fun for the neighbors.Initially we added one new comedy a year, then expanded to one comedy and one tragedy. This summer brings a total of eleven different plays to our season, and Laurelhurst Festival 2015 will span two weekends, Thursday, July 23 - Sunday August 2. (Our poor apprentices even have a three-show-day to look forward to!) We hope to eventually test our mettle, muscle, and memories against the model of the 16th century masters, whose schedule regularly involved producing six different plays in six days, or seasons consisting of 26 performances of 16 different plays, a couple of which would be premieres!Become a Patron of the New Old ArtsPlease support our efforts by making a monetary gift towards our Laurelhurst Festival. As fascinating as it is to run into the same limiting factors as our predecessors - the original Original Practicioners - we are not solely conducting the OP experiment as an exercise. Our performers do step into the shoes of 16th century professionals and walk miles in them all summer long, so we are less excited about exploring how they struggled with their model than where it succeeds in 21st century Portland.Read further to learn more about supporting our festival, what it means to OPS, and what we have to offer your community. Or, if you're ready to give, check out the sidebar to the right of your screen and find a level of giving that matches your means and your corresponding gift!THE DEALWhat We Need...Our shows are always free, so we depend on audience donations to cover costs, plus grants and the support of schools and a few private theatre patrons. The base rate for actors to cast this years Laurelhurst Festival alone will cost approximately $3,000!We humbly request the support of those in our community with the means to help us raise $3,000 - a substantial portion of our operating budget, symbolic of mounting the Laurelhurst Festival. As catchy as it sounds to ask you to ""Pay an actor's salary!"" this year, our success in this season's campaign will determine our operating budget for next year's festival. We would love to show you what we can do with a significant increase in production value! But none of our actors will be going hungry this summer.Of course we don't expect all our supporters to be season sponsors.

was founded in August 2007 by Christopher Tabor and Lynn Brennan Tabor
who were former dancers and staff with the Cleveland Ballet.  PYB is a pre-professional troupe of
young dancers which provides performing opportunities throughout the year including their annual holiday ballet, Winterglow; a Spring Recital; and the August Gala with guest performances from other
youth companies in the Oregon/California/Washington areas. </span><br/>
</h3>
<p>PYB's goal is to provide a nurturing environment for
young artists, to help them not only learn the craft of ballet, but find their
own unique form of expression in interesting and challenging choreography.  </p>
<p>Part of PYB’s 
mission is to continue to collaborate with other youth companies in
Oregon and support each other in an often fragile arts world. In addition to
their home season, PYB is delighted to perform yearly in Coos Bay with Ballet
Pacific each February, and also to participate in the
Northwest Dance Festival in Eugene in April.</p>

production of Winterglow.  We are
hoping to add new costumes and lighting. 
We also have the challenge of higher theater rental in downtown
Portland.  With its escalating
property values, Portland has become the hot destination now, and we’re
experiencing incredible growth in the city.  With property having a higher price tag here we have learned
that we must now come up with more funds to continue to do what we do.  Our cool snow scene needs to survive
the Portland heat wave!</span></p>

young dancers which provides performing opportunities throughout the year including their annual holiday ballet, Winterglow; a Spring Recital; and the August Gala with guest performances from other
youth companies in the Oregon/California/Washington areas. 

PYB's goal is to provide a nurturing environment for
young artists, to help them not only learn the craft of ballet, but find their
own unique form of expression in interesting and challenging choreography.  
Part of PYB’s 
mission is to continue to collaborate with other youth companies in
Oregon and support each other in an often fragile arts world. In addition to
their home season, PYB is delighted to perform yearly in Coos Bay with Ballet
Pacific each February, and also to participate in the
Northwest Dance Festival in Eugene in April.

   What We Need & What You Get PYB needs $3000 to help create a new snow scene for the 2016
production of Winterglow.  We are
hoping to add new costumes and lighting. 
We also have the challenge of higher theater rental in downtown
Portland.  With its escalating
property values, Portland has become the hot destination now, and we’re
experiencing incredible growth in the city.  With property having a higher price tag here we have learned
that we must now come up with more funds to continue to do what we do.  Our cool snow scene needs to survive
the Portland heat wave!
On the right you'll see some amazing thank yous, including limited edition items and creative gift ideas.  Act fast if you see something you or a dancer you know might like, as the campaign will only be live for a short time! 


The Impact As part of its mission, PYB is committed to presenting socially relevant, family-friendly productions.  In 2012, Portland Youth Ballet presented the original dance-centered musical RECOGNITION, and was nominated for six
Portland Area Musical Theater Awards (PAMTAs), winning the award for Best
Ensemble, the only Portland dance company to be so honored.
Opportunities for dancers to learn their craft under expert guidance in a nurturing environment are extremely rare - it is a gift and privilege to have such a school in our community.  You can impact current and future dancers and their families by donating today!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>A brand new, original Marx Brothers Play - ""Lab Birds"" - bringing the familiar and hilarious antics that long-time fans and a new generation will love and cherish.  <br/>Storyline:  Set in the 1930's and accompanied by musical performances and wonderful chaos, Lab Birds takes us to a Laboratory where Groucho ""works"" alongside his mischievous partners, Chico and Harpo, and an Aviary where a Zoo Keeper and her lover are in dire need of help.  With Margaret Dumont, the traditional 'straight woman', as the Lab's benefactor and a stern, hot tempered lab head doctor, nothing but hilarity will ensue when the Marx Brothers take over.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign is to help this play become the best it can be, from bringing in the best possible talent and crew, to promotion, to costuming, minor special effects (vaudeville-style), music, sets, and insurance.  <br/><br/>There have been no new, original full story Marx Brothers plays or movies in decades and we hope, with your help, to make this happen and encourage others to do the same.  The Marx Brothers' unique style of comedy, like Monty Python's and Mel Brooks', made a huge impact on society, influencing many who would become great entertainers, and will continue to do so with this play.<br/><br/>Be a part of a revival and help bring in the new generation to brilliant comedy! By contributing, you become a part of this special and unique opportunity!<br/><br/>On the dark side of the force, if we cannot raise enough money, we will possibly lose good talent and crew who would be otherwise unable to help out without some compensation for their efforts.  Don't let the world lose a marvelous, original production that would help influence new generations of comedians, which, as a result, would give you better entertainment in every form of media.<br/><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $12,000 to be able to pay something to the crew who work the lighting every show, construct the stage and move it, work the sound, and to the cast who sing, dance, and explode with comedy and sweat at every rehearsal and show for the audience.  We also need to cover basic costs for costumes, sets, minor special effects (vaudeville-style), theatre usage, promotion materials, and it would be great to have a little extra to cover gas/transportation costs.  We also will be charged between 4-7% on anything we raise between paypal and indiegogo fees, so our campaign amount takes this into account as well.<br/>We have no other funding sources at this time so we're currently relying on Indiegogo (our first time using it), so please give us hope!<br/>If we can't raise enough to meet our entire goal, the money raised will still go toward the production, which will absolutely happen! If the play can't go live on the raised amount by October, then we can keep the most important aspects on tap to do the show at a later time when the rest of the money needed is raised.  If we get even half of what's asked for, we can still do it, but it will make it riskier to do as the main concern is in keeping the hard-to-find cast handling the physically and mentally demanding principle roles of Groucho, Chico, and Harpo.  Finding them is hard enough - keeping them is super important and promise of compensation really helps ensure that.<br/><br/>Perks for contributing to our campaign!  You will have our undying love and access to a wonderful production!  Yes, even if you don't live near Los Angeles, or can't make it to a show, we will be filming it and putting it up online for you to be able to watch.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If for some reason, it is impossible for you to contribute monetarily, or in addition to such contribution you wish to help out in other ways, we would totally appreciate you getting the word out in as big a way as you can!  The more people that know about this production the better.  It means that our actors can have a bigger audience, the play has a better chance of touring in more areas, more people will come to indiegogo to make a contribution, and more babies will grow up to be awesome entertainers!  Maybe your babies!  Maybe someone else's and you didn't even have to raise the little ones!<br/>Don't forget about the Share Tools on this project/site to help you get the word out.<br/>Thank you for your help and we hope to have this puppy barking in no time!<br/>~Adrianne</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Laugh/Riot Performing Arts Company is reaching the end of our first season as Edinboro University's Resident Theatre program, and we're preparing for a bigger and better second season.  We're asking for your help to make sure that our season reaches its full potential.  We have several different projects coming up this year that we're excited for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our second theatrical season, based around a Theatre of Cruelty theme: Agamemnon 2.0, The Bacchae, No Exit, Jet of Blood, The Collector, and our annual New Works festival.</li>
<li>A Northwest Pennsylvania Theatre Festival highlighting the best performances from area high schools, presented at Edinboro University in May 2014.  We will also be recognizing the top performers with either a scholarship or savings bond.</li>
<li>An audition workshop that will bring theatre and film directors, as well as summerstock theatres and amusement parks, together to help people learn about the different types of auditions and how to best prepare for them.  People who attend may also be given the ability to audition for some of these places.</li>
<li>A biweekly or monthly television program highlighting the performing arts events in Erie and Crawford counties.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are committed to keeping the arts affordable and available to everyone - our most expensive tickets are only $10. </p>
<p>By sponsoring our second season, you can help us complete all of these projects and still keep them affordable for everyone.  In addition, you'll be recognized as a proud supporter of a quickly growing community theatre!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Every dollar of your sponsorship will be used for our projects:</p>
<p>Our 6-show season has a budget of $2,500 to cover the cost of rights, scripts, and scene supplies.  This budget is extremely low for such a large season, but we feel that it's enough to provide high-quality productions.  For this campaign, we are looking to raise $1,500; any money past that goal will be used to reach our $2,500 budget.  Should we surpass $2,500, those funds will be split between the show budget and the Theatre Festival awards.</p>
<p>For your sponsorship, you can receive recognition in our programs, advertising for your business or service, and free tickets - which you can use or donate to area high schools!</p>
<p>Should we not reach our goal, the funds will be divided accordingly for the shows in our season.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your help can assist us in creating an even stronger arts community in the area and provide students with the knowledge and ability to keep performing arts a vital part of their lives past high school and college, as well as allow community members to experiment with theatre for the first time:</p>
<p>Every Laugh/Riot show from our first season had at least one actor who had never stepped onstage since high school, if even then.</p>
<p>Our artistic director and several of our Board members have graduate degrees in theatre and/or education.  We have made theatre (and theatre education) a vital part of our lives and offer high-quality productions and actor training during our rehearsal processes.</p>
<p>Our audience has grown for each of our performances, and the critical response to each production has been amazing.  These positives challenge us to make sure that each production is stronger than the last.</p>

<h3>What's The Deal?</h3>
<p>In early August, I fly out to Wisconson to join 13 other talented young actors. The goal of this internship is ""to further the development of the next generation of American theater artsits."" To do that, I'll be understudying professional actors from across the country as well as filling principal and ensemble roles in their 11 show season. This internship has not only been running for 50 years, but it is also one of the most highly respected programs in its field. However, once August hits I will be getting by on food stamps, which isn't too bad it builds character. But I will not have enough money to even pay my cell phone bill. I'm asking for donations to help me eat, pay bills, and move out of Milwaukee when the internship is over. </p>

<div>
<p>A classically trained actor out of the University of Houston Professional Actor Training Program. I'm the first in my family to go to college, let alone hold a Master's Degree. Raised in Philadelphia I grew up with a love of improv! I then went right into graduate training. At the University of Houston I became proficient in multiple dialects, was recognized in five different weapons for stage combat, and produced scene work ranging from Tennesse Williams to William Shakespeare. Grad school opened my eyes to how big the world of acting is. Now I plan on exploring and defining where I will work and what kind of work I will be doing in my career. </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Ok so here's the deal:</p>
<p>I need $2000 to survive my nine months in Milwaukee. This money will be used to pay my cell phone bill, grocery shop, and help me move to Chicago in May. The only thing I can really afford to give those that donate is my thanks. Your support will be forever appreciated. I will send out posts and shout outs to recognize people that are helping me make the next step in my career. To those that contribute larger amounts, I will film a monologue of their choosing and post it to youtube! I'm pretty excited about that perk and hope to recieve some creative suggestions.</p>

At the University of Houston I became proficient in multiple dialects, was recognized in five different weapons for stage combat, and produced scene work ranging from Tennesse Williams to William Shakespeare. Grad school opened my eyes to how big the world of acting is. Now I plan on exploring and defining where I will work and what kind of work I will be doing in my career.

In the world of theater, Milwaukee Rep is high on the food chain. And much like other professions, the best way to secure great work is to work for great companies. The Rep is one of them: check out this write up about Milwaukee and other 'arts' cities here

What I Need & What You Get
Ok so here's the deal:
I need $2000 to survive my nine months in Milwaukee. This money will be used to pay my cell phone bill, grocery shop, and help me move to Chicago in May. The only thing I can really afford to give those that donate is my thanks. Your support will be forever appreciated. I will send out posts and shout outs to recognize people that are helping me make the next step in my career. To those that contribute larger amounts, I will film a monologue of their choosing and post it to youtube! I'm pretty excited about that perk and hope to recieve some creative suggestions.

<p>We have been an operating puppet theater, studio, and museum for the last 15 years, offering diverse storylines, rooting from cultures all over the world.  Our repertory includes folklore from Russian, West African, Central American, Jewish, Japanese, Native American, and Western European!  However, post-2009 recession we have had trouble budgeting development funding for new productions in today's climate.  BUT we're still here, and we're still committed to Detroit and want to bring you our newest installment, ""Mouk's Adventures"".</p>
<p><strong>Backstory</strong></p>
<p>""Mouk's Adventures"" will be our first show based from Wilhelm Hauff's fairy tale collection from 1826; specifically <em>Der kleine Muck</em>, rooted from Arabic culture.  Through these magical stories we have been inspired to create an adaptation of the tale, to add to our permanent repertory.  ""Mouk's Adventures"" follows a young boy, in the desert, who has much misfortune, and is teased by his neighbors for having very large feet and an oversized head.  Little Mouk, also known as ""mook"" or ""muck"", finds himself looking for happiness and fortune. Through many trials and mishaps on his journey he ultimately finds what he seeks. </p>
<p><strong>Where we are</strong></p>
<p>As a year-round center for the arts, specifically puppetry, our mission to serve the youth of Detroit has never been greater.  However, we need to remain engaging and fresh to our audience, as well as sensitive to who are audience is.  Keeping this in mind, Metro-Detroit houses the largest population of Arab-Americans in the country and because of this, along with the countless fieldtrips from Dearborn area schools, we have been compelled to include a story relating to Arabic culture to our collection.  </p>
<p>Currently, we are about 30% done with the production of the show.  We have a team of actors rehearsing every week, sketches, audio, masks, small props, and a storyline.  What we need now is the opportunity to bring it to life!  The next steps include the fabricating of full scale puppets, costumes, and stage sets.  With your generosity and support we know that we can do this!!  For as little as $1 you can make this a reality for kids AND adults all over Metro-Detroit! </p>

During our performance weekend, we will present a Friday morning performance for homeschooled children which will include a program that talks about dance, technology and the mixing of the two.  For the evening and matinee concerts, artists will join the audience on stage for a question and answer session.  These after performance chats have become one of the best parts of our performance weekend. It allows our audience to ask questions about the work and creates a dialogue about the creation and presentation of modern dance.If a monetary donation just isn’t in the stars for you, please pass this information on toanyone you think might be interested.  Your support for this wonderful work of art will be gratefully appreciated!  And don’t forget to get your tickets and come to the theater January 17-19 to see Spitting Ether!!All photos by Lynn Lane",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Becky Namgauds, I'm a dancer and choreographer based between London and Birmingham, creating dance work which explores the female experience and pushes boundaries between art forms and movement disciplines.</p>
<p>I am crowdfunding to raise £1500 for a project my new project, Rodadoras.</p>
<p>Rodadoras is a strong, physical and female driven work, responding to challenging themes of femicide and eco-feminism, specific cases like Los Feminicidios where women’s bodies were found in rivers and wastelands and the affects globally. Connecting the female form and the earth.</p>
<p>This is a fresh, exciting work; current in content and theme, the piece explores a specific and unique movement language. Drawing on contemporary dance and Capoeira a highly physical and visually commanding aesthetic is created, alongside a rich rhythmical sound score. The soil creates an immersive texture and visceral quality to the work, and is enhanced by performing outdoors. The subtleties that nature allows, when the wind blows the dancers hair or a change of light, all cultivates a rich atmosphere and surreal imagery. </p>
<p>This will be my first independent creation where I will have the time, space and the support Ineed to create the vision. I have been researching and developing ideas for this work for the last two years, gathering a creative team, supporters and partners, and now more than ever feel ready to create the vision. The piece is being created over 3 weeks with 3 fantastic dance artists in Birmingham with performances already booked during spring and summer in Edinburgh, London, Birmingham and the Netherlands. With more to come!</p>
<p>Rodadoras is being produced by Amy Sheppard, a freelance dance artist and producer who brings over 6 years’ experience across the dance, theatre and charity sectors. She gained excellent skills in producing, project management and coordination and artist management through her positions at IdeasTap and East London Dance. She is currently working in a freelance capacity as a dance artist and producer with the Royal Opera House, Royal Academy of Dance, Jeanefer Jean-Charles and ShepsDance. Together we have developed a wonderful partnership and with her support we secured funding from the Arts Council as well as some fantastic programming dates. </p>
<p>Any contributions will greatly help us to achieve the best version of this show possible. With the money, we will be able to produce a show of the highest quality.</p>
<p>We are aiming to raise £1500. This is less than 5% of our total budget. The rest of our costs are covered by funding bodies, partners and money raised by myself through teaching workshops. Though 5% doesn’t sound like much, £1500 is still a lot of money to raise but will help us to create Rodadoras the way we envision it. We will ensure we give back as much as we can through performances in the future once the show is created.</p>
<p>This money is going directly to the purchasing and construction of the set, costumes, and a videographer to film the work. As an artist, individual and company who cares about the environment and local community, all the products we buy will be from small businesses and independent creators. We do our best to be as green as possible when creating work.</p>
<p>These parts come together to create a specific aesthetic and value. We hope you will want to invest in this work the way we invest in people. As an outdoor piece the festivals and performances we will perform at will be mostly unticketed and free, so any money invested in Rodadoras will go back into the community through our performances. We want to share the work with you!</p>
<p>-£500 will be spent on the set which includes 500 litres of soil, tarpaulin covers and the materials and labour to create a wooden frame which will act as a flower box to contain the soil.</p>
<p>-£200 will be spent on costume for the 3 dancers, these will be sourced from ethical and ecological materials and sustainable clothes makers.</p>
<p>-£600 will be spent on a film of the show. An independent professional film maker and photographer who will film and edit a performance and new images for us to easily market the work into the future.</p>
<p>-£200 will be spent on the design for new marketing materials and online media.</p>
<p>Creating a set and costumes which are durable and sustainable means we will be able to use them for longer and avoid costs to repurchase or fix any damages. Investing in quality materials will support the long term of this work and insure we can reach more people with more performances. The impact of your contributions will also allow us to ensure we can pay the dancers, collaborators and organisers in line with industry standards and the fees they deserve.</p>
<p>I am passionate about making dance for the outdoors because it creates visually exciting work and immerse the performers and audiences in their surroundings. This is magical and unique to each performance and very different to theatre based work. It also allows us to perform to many people especially those who may not have access to dance theatre.</p>
<p>Making and performing outdoor work is very rewarding and brings the art form to various communities because it's free and accessible. Therefore, we don't take any ticket sales and it makes putting work on very challenging so any help you can give, even £1 will really help! </p>
<p>Even £5 goes such a long way, but if you are unable to donate, that's ok! We encourage you to come see our production live. For more info contact info@beckynamgauds.com or follow us on facebook, instagram or twitter.</p>
<p>If you would like to support our campaign but are unable to donate then you can still help us by sharing the campaign via social media, email or word of mouth! Spreading the word and sharing our project with your friends will help us a lot.</p>
<p>Rodadoras is supported by Arts Council England, DanceXchange Choreography Award, East London Dance, Hofesh Shechter and University of Wolverhampton. We need a further £1500 which will contribute towards the production if the work.</p>

<h3><em>Scribblin' at the Automat</em></h3>
<p>In the spring of 1955 two high school friends meet at and Automat (a streamlined eatery frequented by many in its day) on 42nd street in New York to catch up on ole times. When the friends in question are James Baldwin and Richard Avedon one would want to hear what they might have to say. America in the mid 50’s the politics; McCarthyism, Civil rights and existing in a post war nuclear age. The culture of Americana; striving for the perfect family. Music; jazz has gone mainstream but everything has taken a back seat to Rock and Roll. The arts, television and film. They have more than enough to chat about.</p>
<p><em>Scribblin’ at the Automat</em> a fictional account based on dynamic careers of these two icons in their respective fields’. At this critical juncture in their careers, the success of Go Tell it on the Mountain, James shouldering the burden of the black writer, anxious as to how his next work will be received by the literary world and the public at large. Avedon already successful as a photographer and editor for Harper’s Bazaar, during this conversation he gains some insight on the perception of celebrity from James point of view.</p>
<h3>Midtown International Theatre Festival</h3>
<p>Midtown International Theatre Festival (MITF) celebrates the diversity of theatre in New York City and abroad.

<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>""__________"", An Opera</i>  is an invitation inside the brain of a writer while she's in the process of writing an opera. We follow the writer and her characters--a wooden egg, a grand lady in 1922 Greenwich Village and her motherless granddaughter, a suicidal pirate, a black leather armchair, and the brain of Bertolt Brecht--as they each try to pursue or avoid the truth.  </p>
<p>A year ago, Ethelyn Friend attended a three-day silent writing retreat led by Playwright Erik Ehn. Out of that silence and space, to her great surprise, emerged the first draft of a very loud and crowded story<i>. </i>At the end of those three days, Ethelyn was certain of two things: this story had to be told as an opera, and the opera's music had to be improvised. She partnered with long-time colleague and collaborator Gary Grundei and assembled an ensemble of performers from all over the country. We started training right away. Our vision included working in a ""retreat"" atmosphere and going further with the integration of extended vocal work with somatic training and Viewpoints work, based on the innovations of Naropa's MFA Contemporary Performance Program. So we brought Erika Berland and Wendell Beavers on board as consultants.</p>
<p><strong>What sets this opera apart: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>improvisation: </strong>While the libretto--the text of the opera--is memorized, the music is improvised live each night. We have spent the last year training together so that we can achieve a level of quality and precision even as we improvise on the spot! </li>
<li>
<strong>audience participation:</strong> Because the opera takes place inside the brain of the writer, and the audience is in there with us, they play a role in steering the course of the opera as well. The audience has the power to, among other things, title the opera, pause the opera, freeze and focus on just one character....and more!</li>
<li>
<strong>""home"" viewing: </strong>The opera is performed inside a small, Victorian house, with only fourteen audience seats each night, creating an uniquely intimate and immersive audience experience.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>This has never been done before, and we need your help to pull it off. Your contribution allows us to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Hire designers and consultants</strong>: Fitting a full-scale, improvisational opera and an audience inside an actual person's actual house is complicated, and we want to make sure that nothing is lost and everything gained in translation. This means enhancing the audience experience with costumes, lights and seating tailored to this unique and intimate setting, without losing any theatre magic. </li>
<li>
<strong>Compensate our performers for a full run:</strong> compensating our performers for this challenging task is an essential value some of whom are travelling across the country to work on this project. </li>
<li>
<strong>Market and promote the opera</strong>: For the last year we have been crafting the world of the opera mostly in isolation, with a few invited audience members to test the material. Now, it's time to share it more widely, and of course that comes with costs. </li>
<li>
<b>Keep ticket prices affordable: </b>with our limits for audience size, we feel it's important to keep ticket prices affordable, offering group rates as well as a reasonable general admission price</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Implications</h3>
<p><strong>A new kind of performance: </strong>It is not hyperbole to say this has never been done before. There is no precedent for an opera with a complex, memorized libretto and entirely improvised music, let alone one set in a house, let alone one in which the audience is invited to interact with the world of the opera. The implications, not just for the future of this piece but for the future of an entirely new way of training and performing, are limitless. </p>
<p><strong>Healing through art: </strong>This is, more than anything, a story about trauma and recovery.

Short Summary
""__________"", An Opera  is an invitation inside the brain of a writer while she's in the process of writing an opera. We follow the writer and her characters--a wooden egg, a grand lady in 1922 Greenwich Village and her motherless granddaughter, a suicidal pirate, a black leather armchair, and the brain of Bertolt Brecht--as they each try to pursue or avoid the truth.  
A year ago, Ethelyn Friend attended a three-day silent writing retreat led by Playwright Erik Ehn. Out of that silence and space, to her great surprise, emerged the first draft of a very loud and crowded story. At the end of those three days, Ethelyn was certain of two things: this story had to be told as an opera, and the opera's music had to be improvised. She partnered with long-time colleague and collaborator Gary Grundei and assembled an ensemble of performers from all over the country. We started training right away. Our vision included working in a ""retreat"" atmosphere and going further with the integration of extended vocal work with somatic training and Viewpoints work, based on the innovations of Naropa's MFA Contemporary Performance Program. So we brought Erika Berland and Wendell Beavers on board as consultants.
What sets this opera apart: 


improvisation: While the libretto--the text of the opera--is memorized, the music is improvised live each night. We have spent the last year training together so that we can achieve a level of quality and precision even as we improvise on the spot! 

audience participation: Because the opera takes place inside the brain of the writer, and the audience is in there with us, they play a role in steering the course of the opera as well. The audience has the power to, among other things, title the opera, pause the opera, freeze and focus on just one character....and more!

""home"" viewing: The opera is performed inside a small, Victorian house, with only fourteen audience seats each night, creating an uniquely intimate and immersive audience experience.  


What We Need 
This has never been done before, and we need your help to pull it off. Your contribution allows us to: 


Hire designers and consultants: Fitting a full-scale, improvisational opera and an audience inside an actual person's actual house is complicated, and we want to make sure that nothing is lost and everything gained in translation. This means enhancing the audience experience with costumes, lights and seating tailored to this unique and intimate setting, without losing any theatre magic. 

Compensate our performers for a full run: compensating our performers for this challenging task is an essential value some of whom are travelling across the country to work on this project. 

Market and promote the opera: For the last year we have been crafting the world of the opera mostly in isolation, with a few invited audience members to test the material. Now, it's time to share it more widely, and of course that comes with costs. 

Keep ticket prices affordable: with our limits for audience size, we feel it's important to keep ticket prices affordable, offering group rates as well as a reasonable general admission price


The Implications
A new kind of performance: It is not hyperbole to say this has never been done before. There is no precedent for an opera with a complex, memorized libretto and entirely improvised music, let alone one set in a house, let alone one in which the audience is invited to interact with the world of the opera. The implications, not just for the future of this piece but for the future of an entirely new way of training and performing, are limitless. 
Healing through art: This is, more than anything, a story about trauma and recovery. What we've found even in our earliest stages of sharing this opera with audiences, is that the impact of the story is magnified by intimacy of the space and the power of improvisation. Here are some things we heard from audience members in our work-in-progress showings: 
"" the journey was very cathartic and healing - if we don't debride wounds, they won't heal. I didn't feel at all like I was reliving my own trauma, I wasn't at all triggered, yet I've known trauma and therefore was able to connect deeply and compassionately with the characters.""
 ""It was a physical experience. While the audience is seated at the edges of the space, it also feels as if we’re sharing the space. The house setting feels very important in that we’re occupying the social space of the family.""
""intriguing, beautiful, horrifying""
""It felt like we transported to an entirely other reality, watched the opera in this alternate universe, and then returned safely back to earth at the end. It also felt hot, and raw, authentic, seeping with deep soul work and presence.""

<p>Heritage High School Rising Stars is the theatre group at Heritage High School, a public high school near San Francisco, which has been creating great high school theatre for 7 years.  Each year we produce a fall play and a spring musical.  Last year we drew record-breaking crowds for our productions of The Grapes of Wrath and Hairspray.  We received nominations in 14 of 18 categories for San Jose's Stage Top Honors awards and won 5 awards, more than any school entered in last year's competition.<br/>We are a self-supporting program.  All money we use to fund the productions are from ticket sales.  No funding is received from the district. We are a 501(c)3 non profit organization.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need:</strong></h3>
<p>The Queen Musical, We Will Rock You has never been seen on a high school stage in the US.  Heritage High School has been selected to be the first and only high school in the United States to premiere Queen's incredible rock musical, We Will Rock You, for 2013.   This is a huge  honor.  </p>
<p>In order to bring this musical to our stage in the manner in which is was written, and to create the exciting rock-concert quality appropriate for this musical, we need to purchase intelligent lighting and special effects lighting for our show.</p>
<p>With your contributions we will be able to show our devoted donors, audiences, and Queen's Management Team our appreciation for the honor of bringing this musical to a US high school stage.  Our reputations as performers and Americans are on the line!  To be able to actually perform this show is a dream and and opportunity of a lifetime, not to mention a chance to expand our range as actors.</p>
<p>So, are you in the mood to help some young aspiring actors?  Will you rock us so we can Rock You?</p>
<div class=""user-content"">
<div>
<h3>Where's All This Money Going?</h3>
<p>Every cent of that $4000 will be going to purchasing the lights needed for this production. We have traditional stage lighting ( fresnels, pars, spots) but to do We Will Rock You right, we need intelligent lighting and assorted laser lights and a hazer to create the appropriate mood and style for the show.</p>
<p>In the unfortunate event that we don't reach our goal in time this campaign will still go towards our lighting needs.  It may not be the special effects lights we need but we will still use every dime on our lighting needs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Having these types of lights and special effects make the show come alive, no doubt, however, these fixtures are different from what we currently have and to give our students the opportunity to install, design, and program this sort of equipment at the high school level enhances their skill sets.  Because we receive no money from the school or the district toward our productions, we must earn all monies above and beyond production costs each year to purchase these items, which are very expensive.  We need at least 5 intelligent light fixtures and at least 6 laser spot fixtures for special effects.  To be able to purchase all the lights we need at once rather than over several years will have a huge and lasting impact on our program and productions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone interested may be able to donate, but please spread the word and help make the people around you aware of our cause. You can come see the show, which opens March 1, 2013.  If you have intelligent lighting or special effects lighting fixtures you would like to donate, please contact us at <a href=""mailto:hhsrisingstarsboosters@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hhsrisingstarsboosters@gmail.com</a></p>

THE BUZZ
Cut
""An extremely well-conceived and well-executed production—a really terrific collaboration between Skillman and The Management...Smartly designed to maximize the intimate playing space—which I’ve seen feel claustrophobically tiny on other occasions—and directed by Meg Sturiano with crackling energy, the piece builds with kinetic excitement through both writing and performance. All three actors (Nicole Beerman as Rene, Megan Hill as Colette, and Joe Varca as Danno) are wonderful."" nytheatre.com

""Skillman's rhythmic dialogue flows like a resentful ode, and director Meg Sturiano stages each confession as if she were choreographing a ballet."" Backstage

""The director of “Cut,” Meg Sturiano, nimbly sustains the pace: music that she and Mr. Varca have chosen for the fade-outs keeps the rhythm pulsing...Ms. Hill delivers a posturing aria of hip-hop speak that almost brings down the house, while Ms. Beerman displays touching poise, Rene’s maturity a counterweight to Colette’s breathless zeal."" New York Times

Lonesome Winter
""Joshua Conkel possesses one of the most deliciously off-kilterimaginations currently being put to use in New York."" NY Press""Plays like Lonesome Winter and playwrights like these are exactlywhat New York needs right now...Take my word for it thatLonesome Winter is the funniest feel-bad show of the holidayseason.""

<p>We are <strong>In Your Face entertainment</strong>, an independent theatre company here in Montreal.  We have been in the business of creating great musical productions since 2010, but our premiere of <strong><em>Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris </em></strong>could use your help!  In case you've never heard of Brel, he was one of the most prolific singer/songwriters of his time, and he died far too young at the age of 49.  He was considered by many to be the master of the French Chanson.  This beautiful show is a retrospective of some of his most compelling songs, with translations by Eric Blau and Mort Shuman, and featuring a cast of four singing in both French and English to a live 4-piece band.</p>
<p>As can imagine, producing musical theatre is a very expensive venture, and we aim to do it right.  There are many small things that make the difference between a good show and a great show, and we are going to put on an AMAZING show!  Our track record is pretty darn good so far, with well-received musical productions of<em><strong> SING!</strong></em> and <em><strong>The Wild Party</strong> </em>under our belt, as well as two sold-out children's theatre shows, but now it's time to step it up a notch.  Plus, it's also time to make sure that not only the production benefits from our fundraising, but so do all the people who work tirelessly to make it happen without ever reaping any benefits - often the case in independent theatre... </p>
<p>We have put together some fantastic perks for your contributions, from complimentary tickets to the show and posters signed by the cast, all the way up to free voice lessons and a private evening of musical theatre just for you given by our very talented cast.  If those categories are not in your budget, though, know that any contribution you make will be greatly appreciated, and will help make this show Brel-worthy.</p>
<p>Please come see the show!  If you love Brel, you will be thoroughly entertained, and if you don't yet know Brel's music, you are in for a real treat.  Thanks for your support.</p>

Through four years of their Amuse Bouche festival, they invited Chicago audiences to taste fresh playwriting voices including Lauren Yee,  Idris Goodwin, Hilary Bettis, Sigrid Gilmer, Bixby Elliot, Greg Moss, Cory Hinkle, Laura Jacqmin, and Joe Waechter. </p>
<p>Pavement Group ceased production in 2014, but Chicago still needs an outlet for fresh playwriting voices. The School at Steppenwolf's Class of 2014 got together and decided to keep this delicious tradition alive with the Appetizer Plays. <br/></p>

</h3><p><b>A Regal History</b></p><div>
<p>The New Regal Theater is located in the former Avalon Theater, which opened in 1927 in the South Shore neighborhood. Designed by movie palace architect John Eberson, its Moorish Revival themes were inspired by an ornate Persian incense burner he found in a New Orleans antique store. The complex houses an auditorium and banquet hall which resonate with almost a century of history. Boasting 2,250 seats, a 2,000 square foot stage, and a full orchestra pit, the theater is one of the largest remaining movie palaces in the country.</p>

<p><b>T</b><b>he Original</b></p>
<p>Located in Chicago’s Bronzeville neighborhood at 47th and South Park Way was the original Regal Theater, which opened in 1928 and showcased iconic talents such as Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, Ray Charles, B. B. King, Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and many more. The original Regal played a key role in the development of black music from the 1920s through the 1960s. The theater was closed in 1970 and the building was eventually demolished in 1973 after being partially destroyed by fire.</p>
<p><b>Looking Forward to the Past</b></p>
<p>Located 5 minutes south, the Avalon operated as a movie theater through the late 1970s and ultimately became vacant after brief use as a community church. In 1985, the Avalon was purchased by Ed and BettiAnn Gardner, who reopened the building in 1987 after an extensive renovation. The building was rechristened the <i>New</i> Regal Theater- an aspirational reference to its Bronzeville ancestor. The New Regal became a Chicago Landmark in 1992 and was ultimately bought by another group. In 2010, the building went into foreclosure, eventually falling into FDIC receivership.</p>

</div></div>","Finding work is difficult, finding work in the arts--nearly
impossible. 
Breach Once More sprouted from alleviating this hopeless
feeling of not getting work in the arts.  We are that little light of hope you
see and hear when you read ""nearly impossible"", because those two
words imply there is hope. We are that hope, we are bridging that gap, we are
Breach Once More. 
We are a place of
community, a place where you will be helping
artists become successful. By donating to Breach Once More, you're not only helping
fund the company, but you're creating work opportunities for young theatre artists now and in the
future. So donate some hope and bridge the gap.

<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Homunculus Mask Theater is an ensemble based company devoted to creating original work that explores new approaches to using masks in the theater. By incorporating masks with movement, music, dance, and optical illusion, Homunculus aims to introduce a new, contemporary form of mask work to a multi-generational audience. Homunculus produces unique, imaginative, and thought provoking theater that, through the use of original, handmade masks, mirrors the humor, sadness, and beauty of our own existence.</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Homunculus has been â€¦ RELOADED!</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">After several years of producing eye-catching and moving physical theater, we are bringing our talents back to the New York City stage for a limited, two week engagement of our brand new show <u><i>Homunculus Reloaded.</i></u>  <span style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77);"">With a wink to traditional styles of mask performance, <u><i>Homunculus Reloaded</i></u> uses our signature style of beautifully grotesque masks (many of which will be unveiled for the first time in this exciting production) to tell image based, non verbal stories.<span style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77);"">   </span>These stories, some literal and others abstract, are a pastiche of visually arresting scenes set to music that segue seamlessly from one into another.<span style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77);"">  The show is, in essence, a live cartoon that effectively uses masks to create a parallel universe to the one we live in.</span></span></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><span style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77);""><span style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77);""><br/></span></span></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><span style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77);""><span style=""color: rgb(77, 77, 77);"">The creative process of cultivating our work is just as unique to Homunculus as our productions.  Through an intense, improvisational rehearsal period, an </span></span>ensemble of actors, dancers, and musicians, under the guidance of Artistic Director Joe Osheroff, will organically develop the show's material.  The characters, connections, and themes that are explored during this process will eventually evolve and mutate into a fully fleshed out production, resulting in some of the most thrilling mask work being performed today.</font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><i><u>Homunculus Reloaded</u></i> will hit the stage April 5th- 7th and April 12th â€“ 14 at 7:30pm and April 7th and 13th at 3pm at Theater 54 in midtown Manhattan.   But before this can happen â€¦ HOMUNCULUS NEEDS YOU!</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Without the generous support of our donors (no matter how deep their pockets, or how big their hearts) we would not be able to grow our company and further invest in increasing our threshold for bold choices.  This includes expanding our arsenal of masks, further utilizing musicians and exploring the possibilities of adding more live music to our shows, performing in bigger and better venues, and the overall opportunity to create even more creatively complex living works of art.</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">We ask for you to donate anything you can today and invest in the future of a truly unique form of performance that, with your generous support, will be here for generations to come.</font></p>

<p><b><font size=""3"">WHAT DOES HOMUNCULUS MEAN TO US???</font></b></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Due to its intrinsically visual nature, Homunculus tells stories in a primitive language-a vocabulary of images, sounds, music and movement that everyone can understand, relate to, and feel moved by, no matter their age or culture.</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Behind the imagery and organized chaos, a powerful and moving message is unveiled. Homunculus is not only entertaining, but is also a catalyst for social change, an antidote to the mundane, and a powerful source of healing for those in need of a deeper connection to the playful child inside us all.</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">With this campaign's success, Homunculus will be abler to continue to grow as a company.  We will be able to add more masks to our repertoire, hire the best designers and musicians, and have a long and bright future ahead of us full of truly unique performances and events.</font></p>

</div></div>","WHO IS HOMUNCULUS???

Homunculus Mask Theater is an ensemble based company devoted to creating original work that explores new approaches to using masks in the theater. By incorporating masks with movement, music, dance, and optical illusion, Homunculus aims to introduce a new, contemporary form of mask work to a multi-generational audience. Homunculus produces unique, imaginative, and thought provoking theater that, through the use of original, handmade masks, mirrors the humor, sadness, and beauty of our own existence.

Homunculus has been â€¦ RELOADED!

After several years of producing eye-catching and moving physical theater, we are bringing our talents back to the New York City stage for a limited, two week engagement of our brand new show Homunculus Reloaded.  With a wink to traditional styles of mask performance, Homunculus Reloaded uses our signature style of beautifully grotesque masks (many of which will be unveiled for the first time in this exciting production) to tell image based, non verbal stories.   These stories, some literal and others abstract, are a pastiche of visually arresting scenes set to music that segue seamlessly from one into another.  The show is, in essence, a live cartoon that effectively uses masks to create a parallel universe to the one we live in.

The creative process of cultivating our work is just as unique to Homunculus as our productions.  Through an intense, improvisational rehearsal period, an ensemble of actors, dancers, and musicians, under the guidance of Artistic Director Joe Osheroff, will organically develop the show's material.  The characters, connections, and themes that are explored during this process will eventually evolve and mutate into a fully fleshed out production, resulting in some of the most thrilling mask work being performed today.

Homunculus Reloaded will hit the stage April 5th- 7th and April 12th â€“ 14 at 7:30pm and April 7th and 13th at 3pm at Theater 54 in midtown Manhattan.   But before this can happen â€¦ HOMUNCULUS NEEDS YOU!

Without the generous support of our donors (no matter how deep their pockets, or how big their hearts) we would not be able to grow our company and further invest in increasing our threshold for bold choices.  This includes expanding our arsenal of masks, further utilizing musicians and exploring the possibilities of adding more live music to our shows, performing in bigger and better venues, and the overall opportunity to create even more creatively complex living works of art.

We ask for you to donate anything you can today and invest in the future of a truly unique form of performance that, with your generous support, will be here for generations to come.

We arenâ€™t just putting all of our eggs in one basket, either! 
On Thursday, March 1st from 6pm - 9pm, we will be hosting a Karaoke Fundraiser, Silent Auction, and Raffle at an amazing karaoke bar â€¦ The Gael Pub ( between 82nd
and 83rd). Rumor has it, you receive a â€˜free shotâ€™ every time you sing!

WHAT DOES HOMUNCULUS MEAN TO US???

Due to its intrinsically visual nature, Homunculus tells stories in a primitive language-a vocabulary of images, sounds, music and movement that everyone can understand, relate to, and feel moved by, no matter their age or culture.

Behind the imagery and organized chaos, a powerful and moving message is unveiled. Homunculus is not only entertaining, but is also a catalyst for social change, an antidote to the mundane, and a powerful source of healing for those in need of a deeper connection to the playful child inside us all.

With this campaign's success, Homunculus will be abler to continue to grow as a company.  We will be able to add more masks to our repertoire, hire the best designers and musicians, and have a long and bright future ahead of us full of truly unique performances and events.


HOW TO HELP HOMUNCULUS???

We need $11,000 to get this project up and running properly.

We had $4,500 from previous fundraising efforts, but now need to raise $6,500 to make up the difference and put this show on properly.

Here is a BRIEF breakdown of what we are spending the money you will be donating to us on:

PERSONNEL = $2,800
Including the actors, designers, stage manager, music director, musicians, house manager, sound and light operator, graphic designer and publicist. For all we need, this is a LOW figure. HELP US!

PRODUCTION = $7,300
This includes theater (just this is about 3,000) and rehearsal space, set, props, lighting rental, costumes, insurance, transportation, and the entirety of our essential mask making materials.

MARKETING & DEVELOPMENT = $900
This covers press packets, programs, posters and fliers both their design and printing, post cards, and all important wine for consumption before the show!!! (For a small donation, of course!)

We are in the process of applying for grants and approaching other donors and donating organizations for support, but those avenues take a bit more time and cultivation, and we are anxious to do a show!

HELP US PAY OUR ACTORS!

HELP US HAVE KICK ASS LIVE MUSIC!!!

HELP US BE READY FOR OUR NEXT SHOW, SO WE CAN BLOW YOU AWAY!!!!!

WHY DONATE TO HOMUNCULUS???
Why you ask??
Check out the perks up and over there
Wow!!! Those are awesome!

OH, AND WHAT HAPPENS IF WE GET MORE THAN WE ASK?
You will help us keep performing for longer! Our goal is to keep establishing our company in the community and perform as many times and in as many venues as possible, so be prepared to be Homunculized for lots of time to come!

<h3><b>I would like to produce a West End/London reading of the musical Kai HÃ¼sgen and I wrote, WHEN ROSE PETALS FALL. A brief synopsis of the show can be seen below.</b></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why do you need to have a reading?</h3>
<h3 style=""font-weight: normal;""><font size=""2"">Having a professional reading of our musical will help 
inform our writing process so much! Hearing and seeing our show in an English version,
performed by professional actors will help us understand the show's

producers.</font></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I have written the musical with Kai HÃ¼sgen in German four years ago. We had a succesful reading in Vienna. After that we won a dutch price to develop the musical (Musicalmakersbeurs TeksTpieremenT). With the money we won we could do a small tour in Belgium and Holland. For that production I won the Flemish musicalaward for best creative achievement (music and book). In 2011 we had a German version that played in Hamburg and Vienna, which got great reviews. Now we got the show translated and plan a staged reading of it in London. ThatÂ´s why we need your help!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
</div><div>
<p>When Rose petals fall tells the story of the 19 year old Tom. He moves into his student room. His single mum, Rose, died recently from cancer. From now on Tom stands on his own. only the memories and the letters, that Rose wrote before she died, are what is left of her. The letters should accompany him through his life.<br/>The pain and the grief of the not processed death gets bigger when Tom meets Iris. She is of the same age as Tom. They quickly converge, but the livly and open mind of Iris reminds him of Rose.

<h2> We want to make you laugh</h2>
<p>And <em>KILL THE CRITIC!</em> is going to do it.</p>
<p><em>KILL THE CRITIC!</em> is the new comedy written by Todd Wallinger and helmed by award-winning director Nancy Holaday.</p>
<h3>
<em>KILL THE CRITIC!</em> <strong>will have its world premiere June 28-29 at the Tri-Lakes Center for the Arts in Palmer Lake, Colorado.</strong>
</h3>
<p>The play centers on Trevor Stanton, an ambitous young actor who, on the night of his Broadway debut, kidnaps New York City's most powerful theater critic.</p>
<p>Trevor's goal? To prevent the critic from writing a scathing review that could destroy his career.</p>
<p>There's just one problem. Trevor accidentally poisons the critic, and as showtime nears, he must take increasingly desperate measures to keep the body hidden from a parade of outrageous characters, including his scotch-swilling co-star, his ditzy girlfriend, a cougarish diva, a neurotic hitman and a pair of bumbling cops.</p>
<p>If you like the zany humor of Mel Brooks and the Marx Brothers, you’re going to love <em>KILL THE CRITIC!</em> Not only is it filled with witty, fast-paced dialogue, but in the tradition of the best farces, it's got a boatload of physical humor too.</p>
<p>I mean seriously, how many other plays feature a professional stunt man in the leading role?</p>
<h2><strong>But we're really poor</strong></h2>
<p>Theatre thrives on new works. But it's not easy--or cheap--bringing a new play to life. There are sets to build and props to buy and actors to pay and performances to advertise.</p>
<p>We estimate total production costs to be about $3500. Ticket sales will cover some of that, but not all. That's why we need your help.</p>
<p>We could ask you to cough up the whole amount. But we're not like that. (And besides, we don't like getting coughed on.) All we're asking for is a measly $1000 to cover the rent on the theater.</p>
<p>If we don't meet our goal, no worries. Any amount we raise will help offset our costs, putting that much more distance between us and complete financial disaster.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h2>What you get</h2>
<p>In exchange for your contribution, we offer some fabulous premiums you just can't get anywhere else.</p>
Chip in $10 or more and you'll get a special mention in our program. We'll even take extra care to spell your name correctly (where else can you get a deal like that?). And if you can't attend the production, we'll mail you a program--assuming the US Postal Service is still in business by then.<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Steup up to a contribution of $30 or more and you'll receive an 11"" by 15"" poster featuring the tasteful artwork above and signed by the entire cast. Guaranteed to go with any furniture or decorating scheme.</p>
<p>Prove your generosity with a contribution of $60 or more and you'll receive an autographed copy of the script. No, we can't promise that <em>KILL THE CRITIC!</em> will join the canon of great American plays. We can't even promise that an original script will go for a million dollars on eBay. But if it does happen, and you passed up the chance to retire at an embarrassingly young age, don't say we didn't warn you.</p>
<p>Dig a little deeper into that pocket with a contribution of $100 or more and you'll receive a real live one-of-a-kind coffee mug adorned with our eye-catching logo shown above. Imagine the great start you'll give your day sipping a cup of joe with a picture of a dead theatre critic on it. To check it out, click <a href=""http://www.cafepress.com/killthecritic.788541677"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Make a splash with a contribution of $200 or more and you snag the sweetest deal of all: everything mentioned above plus two reserved tickets to any performance of <em>KILL THE CRITIC!</em> These tickets are right up front, where you'll be able to stretch your legs and disdain the muttering rabble behind you.</p>
<p>If you own a business, and you've always dreamed of being one of those patrons of old, lavishing wealth on the brightest artists in your realm, you might consider contributing $500 or more. In addition to all of the premiums mentioned above, this will get you a corporate sponsorship, and we will do everything we can to promote your business in our program, on all of our advertising materials, on our website and at all performances.</p>
<p>Best of all, contributors at every level can sleep soundly at night knowing that they support brand spanking new theatre.</p>

And KILL THE CRITIC! is going to do it.
KILL THE CRITIC! is the new comedy written by Todd Wallinger and helmed by award-winning director Nancy Holaday.

KILL THE CRITIC! will have its world premiere June 28-29 at the Tri-Lakes Center for the Arts in Palmer Lake, Colorado.

The play centers on Trevor Stanton, an ambitous young actor who, on the night of his Broadway debut, kidnaps New York City's most powerful theater critic.
Trevor's goal? To prevent the critic from writing a scathing review that could destroy his career.
There's just one problem. Trevor accidentally poisons the critic, and as showtime nears, he must take increasingly desperate measures to keep the body hidden from a parade of outrageous characters, including his scotch-swilling co-star, his ditzy girlfriend, a cougarish diva, a neurotic hitman and a pair of bumbling cops.
If you like the zany humor of Mel Brooks and the Marx Brothers, you’re going to love KILL THE CRITIC! Not only is it filled with witty, fast-paced dialogue, but in the tradition of the best farces, it's got a boatload of physical humor too.
I mean seriously, how many other plays feature a professional stunt man in the leading role?
But we're really poor
Theatre thrives on new works. But it's not easy--or cheap--bringing a new play to life. There are sets to build and props to buy and actors to pay and performances to advertise.
We estimate total production costs to be about $3500. Ticket sales will cover some of that, but not all. That's why we need your help.
We could ask you to cough up the whole amount. But we're not like that. (And besides, we don't like getting coughed on.) All we're asking for is a measly $1000 to cover the rent on the theater.
If we don't meet our goal, no worries. Any amount we raise will help offset our costs, putting that much more distance between us and complete financial disaster.



What you get
In exchange for your contribution, we offer some fabulous premiums you just can't get anywhere else.
Chip in $10 or more and you'll get a special mention in our program. We'll even take extra care to spell your name correctly (where else can you get a deal like that?). And if you can't attend the production, we'll mail you a program--assuming the US Postal Service is still in business by then.


Steup up to a contribution of $30 or more and you'll receive an 11"" by 15"" poster featuring the tasteful artwork above and signed by the entire cast. Guaranteed to go with any furniture or decorating scheme.
Prove your generosity with a contribution of $60 or more and you'll receive an autographed copy of the script. No, we can't promise that KILL THE CRITIC! will join the canon of great American plays. We can't even promise that an original script will go for a million dollars on eBay. But if it does happen, and you passed up the chance to retire at an embarrassingly young age, don't say we didn't warn you.
Dig a little deeper into that pocket with a contribution of $100 or more and you'll receive a real live one-of-a-kind coffee mug adorned with our eye-catching logo shown above. Imagine the great start you'll give your day sipping a cup of joe with a picture of a dead theatre critic on it. To check it out, click here.
Make a splash with a contribution of $200 or more and you snag the sweetest deal of all: everything mentioned above plus two reserved tickets to any performance of KILL THE CRITIC! These tickets are right up front, where you'll be able to stretch your legs and disdain the muttering rabble behind you.
If you own a business, and you've always dreamed of being one of those patrons of old, lavishing wealth on the brightest artists in your realm, you might consider contributing $500 or more. In addition to all of the premiums mentioned above, this will get you a corporate sponsorship, and we will do everything we can to promote your business in our program, on all of our advertising materials, on our website and at all performances.
Best of all, contributors at every level can sleep soundly at night knowing that they support brand spanking new theatre.

<p>Hey world!  Above the Curve Theatre is at it again with another phenomenal musical lined up, Songs for a New World by Jason Robert Brown.   We have raised all the funds for the theatre rental, rights for the show, and everything in between EXCEPT enough money for an accompanist, which this show really needs.</p>
<p> Here is a little about our company!</p>
<p>Founded May 2006 in Los Angeles, CA, Above the Curve Theatre Company is a women-driven, actor-derived, not-for-profit organization dedicated to empowering female artists and strengthening our community.<br/><br/>We provide a fun and safe environment for artists to cultivate new and current talents. All members are encouraged to write, act, produce and direct.  Our goal is to develop versatile artists capable of creating more dynamic work for women and tackling the most challenging roles.<br/><br/>At the same time, Above the Curve Theatre strives to provide the community with professional productions held to the highest standards of excellence. Through the awesome power of the performing arts, the ensemble hopes to educate and entertain, but it does not stop there – members are also encouraged to give back to our community through group sponsored charity events and outreach programs.<br/><br/><br/>Above the Curve is proudly sponsored by Emerge Arts Projects, Inc, a not-for-profit, 501(c)3 entity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This show is a big undertaking for us, as it is the most expensive show we have done, and our longest run to date.</p>
<ul>
<li>All of your donation will go to paying for an accompanist for the entire run, as well as a few rehearsals with him or her.  There are 18 performances, so our goal would allow us to pay the accompanist about $56 a night, and I would love to give him/her more, since that is not very much for an entire evening of piano playing.  </li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, whatever money we do get will go towards an accompanist, and some of the actors in the show (who are not getting paid) are willing to shell out some money too.  This is how much they want this show to be successful!!!</li>
</ul><h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Los Angeles needs good theatre, and we are trying to provide it, so if you want more quality shows in LA, any donation can help!</li>
<li>Our company is know for providing a safe and fun environment for actors as well as putting on quality productions, given a limited budget.  Help us take the next step up in the Los Angeles theatre world by making a donation.</li>

<p><strong>""I am deeply impressed with the vision and originality of The Tennessee Project! It is everything that a holistic arts project should be: grounded in excellence, collaborative in nature, and focused on community. Bravo."" - Albert Schultz, Artistic Director of Soulpepper</strong></p>
<p>In May of 2012 The Tennessee Project, the inaugural smash-hit theatre festival, presented forty seven performances over seven nights, selling out 80% of houses, and playing to more than 2,500 Torontonians. With their extensive media coverage, cross-promotions, and partnerships, the Project is estimated to have reached 2,495,000 Torontonians. The Café Series, featuring free performances around the city, was packed every night. And an article in The Grid (about whether or not Toronto’s theatre scene can stay afloat) cited The Tennessee Project as being “what we want”. </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Seven theatre companies come together in a massive collaborative effort to stage seven one-acts plays by a featured playwright...</p>
<p>These productions are staged in seven different Toronto neighbourhoods....</p>
<p>Every night for a week, each production rotates to a different neighbourhood, giving each community a spectacular and unique week-long event, and each company a chance to build relationships with audiences for whom they might not otherwise perform. </p>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<div class=""page"" title=""Page 9"">
<div class=""layoutArea"">
<div class=""column"">
<p><strong>""This project descends on Toronto's neighbourhoods and wins the hearts and minds of the people! It creates new patrons and saves the old ones bus fare. It is possible for anybody to return night after night to the venue down the block to see scores of artists occupy corners of Toronto neglected by other festivals.” - Audrey Wiles, audience member of The Tennessee Project</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Project aims to build a tighter sense of community amongst artists and audiences. The rotating format, the brevity of the one-acts, and the localized neighbourhood-based creates an uncomplicated, friendly theatre-going experience for audiences. And the collaborative format allows disparate groups of theatre-makers to share their resources and knowledge, and expand upon their audience base for years to come. </p>
<h3>The Playwright Project officially announces its 2013 line-up on November 26th, 2012. Who will be the featured playwright? In what neighbourhoods will we be appearing? Who will be our seven companies? Keep an ear open. </h3>

<p>Four people are covered in mud. They stand alone on an island with eyes that shift and then with bodies that roll, leap, twitch, swoop, and hide underneath the earth. The dancers are quirky, animalistic, and bizarre. They exist in a place uninhabited by other humans, but you watch them from the comfort of your office chair.</p>
<p>We are graduating from The Ohio State University with BFAs in Dance and are planning our first project as graduates! We are filming a 10-15 minute dance film on Little Tybee Island, an island near Savannah that can only be reached by boat, for one week this May. Three other graduating students from the OSU Department of Dance are joining us to create a piece about how people can relate to and within an isolated environment. After we have created the film, it will be available online for everyone to see whenever they want. We will also submit it to film festivals all over the world, including Dance Camera West (Los Angeles), Frame Works Dance Film Series, San Francisco Dance Film Festival, Festival Internacional Videodanza Chile, Dance and Media Japan, and Cinedans Amsterdam. We are also planning to have a special screening for the Savannah community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Problem (and Solution)</h2>
<p>Even though dancing on an island is free, making a dance film on it is not. We need $2,000 to pay for</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation costs</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Composer wages</li>
<li>Videographer wages</li>
<li>Dancer wages </li>
</ul><p>We would love for you to become a part of our collaborative team! For contributing to the project, you will receive copious amounts of thanks that range from a grateful note to the ability to download the final film to being listed as a producer in the film’s credits. You can help make our vision a reality! Check out our perks for all the details.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>As dancer-artists, we feel compelled not only to make thought-provoking, beautiful art, but to also share it with the community. Dance film gives us a great avenue to reach people who would not normally come to a theatre to see contemporary dance because the art is brought right to their computer screens.</p>
<p>Ohio State has one of the best dance departments in the country, and we feel ready to step out with our own fresh voice. We have been creating and performing in works outside the university while still in school, including an art benefit in Chicago, a college dance festival in Brooklyn, The American Dance Festival, dance intensives in New York City, a pop-up art show in Ann Arbor, and (for one of our dancers) in a Broadway musical! We are ready and excited to make our mark on the dance scene, and we want to make that mark as accessible to as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Quentin Burley, performer</p></div>","The Gist
Four people are covered in mud. They stand alone on an island with eyes that shift and then with bodies that roll, leap, twitch, swoop, and hide underneath the earth. The dancers are quirky, animalistic, and bizarre. They exist in a place uninhabited by other humans, but you watch them from the comfort of your office chair.

<p> « <em>La fête à Jean </em>», est un spectacle produit par le <em>Théâtre L’instant</em>, qui a été sélectionné pour la saison théâtrale 2012-2013 à la Salle Fred-Barry du Théâtre Denise-Pelletier. Les représentations auront lieu du 9 au 26 janvier 2013. Et qui dit nouvelle création, dit: recherche de fonds !</p>
<p>Tout a commencé il y a un peu plus de trois ans. À cette époque, nous fréquentions régulièrement un groupe de soutien pour les personnes endeuillées. Chaque membre de la compagnie vivait un deuil. Les rencontres se déroulaient chaque lundi après-midi, au Salon b sur la rue St-Laurent, avec le thérapeute Michel Trozzo. Ces réunions gratuites nommées «Lundi-Causerie» sont une initiative de la maison Alfred Dallaire/MEMORIA. Notre désir commun au Théâtre L’instant était de faire des spectacles avec un impact social, une forme de théâtre documentaire. Nous avons donc organisé des ateliers d’écriture avec les participants ce groupe afin que notre jeune auteur, Pier-Luc Lasalle,  puisse s’inspirer des témoignages de chacun. Et c’est ainsi que « <em>La fête à Jean</em> » a commencé sa longue gestation.</p>
<p>Notre intention, notre motivation première : donner la parole aux endeuillés. Cette histoire parle d’un thème  important, car c’est une réalité qui touche chacun d’entre nous,  mais bien souvent, nous préférons fuir la question. Le <em>Théâtre L’instant </em>a eu envie de rendre hommage au courage de ceux que nous avons côtoyés dans le groupe de soutien les lundis après-midi sur la rue St-Laurent. Ils sont devenus 9 personnages qui vont vivre sur scène, sous vos yeux,  leur tristesse, les non-dits, les malaises et la douleur reliée à leur perte, mais aussi de grands moments de joie et de puissante libération.</p>

On l’entend peut-être pour la dernière fois…</p>
<p>La mort prochaine de Jean ravive, chez certains, des deuils vécus, récents ou anciens. Que ce soit le départ d’un conjoint, d’un parent, d’un enfant, d’un frère… Alors que la fête bat son plein, les spectateurs ont accès aux souvenirs heureux des uns, à la douleur encore vive des autres. Des voix s’élèvent pour raconter un deuil, pour dire tout ce qu’on ne dit pas, tout ce qu’on ne veut pas entendre. Parce que fête ou pas,  il faut, plus souvent qu’autrement, garder le sourire. </p>

<p>We are calling out to all lovers of dance, WDA-A membership, and friends and family of the nominated finalists to help the selected finalist achieve their dream of traveling to Taiwan and participating in this once in a lifetime opportunity!</p>
<p>The young WDA-A choreographer selected to participate by the IYCP will receive housing, local transportation, access to dancers and studio space, publicity, production and administrative assistance, and an honorarium. However, the airfare is not covered.</p>
<p>The airfare is not cheap.  The three finalists have all agreed in good faith to support one another by collaborating in this fundraising drive to help offset the expensive round-trip airfare cost to get the selected young choreographer to Taiwan. Your support will help one of them achieve their dreams. Any little amount donated will help!</p>
<p>Now let me introduce you to the finalists!</p>
<p><strong>Caitlyn Casson</strong> is an emerging dancer/choreographer with a passion for contemporary movement and a desire to develop herself as a global artist via internationally diverse, artistic endeavors. She recently graduated from the University of South Florida, Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in modern dance performance and a minor is Psychology. While at USF, she had the immense pleasure of working with, and performing repertoire by distinguished artists Bill T. Jones, Doug Varone and Talley Beatty. She was also able to study extensively with USF professors Michael Foley, John Parks, Paula Nunez, Andrew Carroll, Jeanne Travers and Lynn Wimmer.

<p><br/>The above video was shared by <span class=""alternate_name"">Eddie Lin</span>, a participant in the 2011 IYCP.</p></div>","One of the three young choreographers below who were recommended by World Dance Alliance - Americas (WDA-A) will be selected to attend the International Young Choreography Projects (IYCP) in Kaohsiung, Taiwan!
We are calling out to all lovers of dance, WDA-A membership, and friends and family of the nominated finalists to help the selected finalist achieve their dream of traveling to Taiwan and participating in this once in a lifetime opportunity!
The young WDA-A choreographer selected to participate by the IYCP will receive housing, local transportation, access to dancers and studio space, publicity, production and administrative assistance, and an honorarium. However, the airfare is not covered.
The airfare is not cheap.  The three finalists have all agreed in good faith to support one another by collaborating in this fundraising drive to help offset the expensive round-trip airfare cost to get the selected young choreographer to Taiwan. Your support will help one of them achieve their dreams. Any little amount donated will help!
Now let me introduce you to the finalists!

They are opposite in terms of way of living, but they have something very important in common: they are both diasporic souls, products of a generation with no sure values, jobs and sentimental relationships. And they are both in NYC.</p><p>Through this anti romantic comedy, you follow their brilliant and often funny dialogues, sharing their perspectives on sex, relationships and work. //</p><p></p><p>Ci piace descrivere “Neighbors” come un viaggio verso avventure urbane, situazioni assurde e intime solitudini, vissute da due immigrati italiani a New York. Petra e Leonardo, questi sono i nomi dei protagonisti, si incontrano come vicini a New York. Entrambi decidono di aprire le loro porte e di sbirciare nella vita dell'altro. Sono agli antipodi in quanto a stile di vita, ma hanno qualcosa di molto importante in comune: sono entrambi animi in fuga, prodotti di una generazione senza una sicura stabilità rispetto a valori, lavori e  amori. E poi sono entrambi a NYC...</p>
<p>Nel corso di questa commedia anti-romantica, seguirete il loro scambi, spesso brillanti e divertenti, affezionandovi alla loro prospettiva sul sesso, sulle relazioni d'amore e sui lavori.</p><br/><p></p><p>BEHIND “NEIGHBORS”</p><p>Many great love stories are born from friendships, but is this the case? Or, to put it in a better way, is a romantic relationship what Petra and Leo really need now? Or is it a sense of family? What are these two character looking for in each other?</p><p>It's very difficult to find the answer. You'll have to see the show to understand the nature of their relationship... Our point is to make you reflect about friendship, love and family. And about the thousands different ways a honest relationship could go! There is a delicate and fine line between all these different ways. With “Neighbors” we tell their story, that tries to be personal and universal at the same time . //</p><p></p><p>Svariate importanti storie d'amore sono nate in seguito ad un rapporto di amicizia: ma in questo caso? O meglio, Petra e Leonardo hanno davvero bisogno di una relazione d'amore in questo momento? O forse è di un senso di famiglia? Cosa cercano questi personaggi l'uno nell'altro?</p>
<p>E' davvero difficile trovare un risposta. Dovete vedere lo spettacolo, per capire la natura di questo rapporto...Quello che cerchiamo di fare, è far riflettere sull'amicizia, l'amore e la famiglia. E sulle migliaia di strade che un rapporto tra due persone può imboccare. Esiste un delicato confine tra tutte queste possibili strade. Con “Neighbors” raccontiamo il loro percorso, che aspira ad essere, allo stesso tempo, personale ed universale.</p><p></p><p>HOW DID THE PROJECT START? // ORIGINI DEL PROGETTO</p><p>The show naturally has been developed in parallel to our real diasporic life.</p><p>In 2012 the actors and playwrights, Irene Turri and Francesco Meola, moved to New York, where they experienced a lot of adventures - the source of inspiration of the show. In 2013 they met the director Ilaria Ambrogi who said:</p><p><i>""this play spoke of us, of all of us. Even in all our different lifestyles or habits, it speaks of us in a profound way: of our sense of family and of our lack of it. Of our struggle in being able to commit or love in a mature way, and our infinite capacity for love. It speaks about our generation, especially of us who live overseas.""</i></p><p>So she decided to direct the play, becoming the third parent of this project.</p><p>After many and many drafts, and after months and months of rehearsal in the little Ilaria's place in NYC, they involved a whole crew of very talented artists and <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">friends, whose collaborations were fundamental to formalize the project.</span></p><p>So, step by step, they created “Neighbors” and a little and lovely family behind it.</p><p>In an overall perspective, these different paths could not help to cross each other.  <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We are inevitably connected since we share the same goals, dreams, struggles and feelings as emigrated young talents. //</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p>Il progetto è nato in parallelo alle nostre vite migranti. Nel 2012 gli attori e autori del testo, Irene Turri e Francesco Meola, si sono spostati a New York dove hanno vissuto una caterva di avventure, vera fonte di ispirazione dello spettacolo. Nel 2013 hanno incontrato la regista Ilaria Ambrogi che disse:</p>
<p><i>“Questo spettacolo parla di noi, di tutti noi. Nonostante i nostri diversi stili di vita e abitudini, lo spettacolo ci rispecchia nel profondo: nel nostro senso di famiglia e nella sua assenza. Del nostro sforzo di impegnarci e amare in maniera matura, e della infinità predisposizione all'amore. Parla della nostra generazione, in particolar modo di chi vive al di là dell'oceano.” (La citazione è stata veramente registrata in un giorno afoso di luglio, su uno dei tavolini verdi di Union Square, verso le 5.30 PM)</i></p>
<p>Così ha deciso di dirigere questo progetto, divenendo a pieno titolo il suo terzo papà/mamma.</p>
<p>Dopo svariate versioni e svariati mesi di prove all'interno del piccolo appartamento di Ilaria a New York, i tre si sono avvalsi di un gruppo di talentuosi artisti e amici, la cui collaborazione si è rivelata fondamentale per dare forma compiuta al progetto.</p>
<p>Passo dopo passo, hanno creato “Neighbors”, dietro a cui è cresciuta una piccola ma amorevole famiglia.</p>
<p>In una prospettiva più ampia, i loro percorsi non potevano non incrociarsi. Siamo inevitabilmente legati, in quanto condividiamo obiettivi, sogni, battaglie e emozioni da talenti emigrati / cervelli in fuga.</p><br/><p></p><p>WHY  TO DONATE? // PERCHE' DONARE?</p><p>The money you donate allows us to make true and possible this project we initiated almost 2 years ago. We strongly believe in our show: <b>hilarious</b>, <b>personal</b> and <b>emotional</b>. And the audience can really sympathize with Petra and Leonado. Talking about their life abroad, we have a chance to give a voice to many young italians and foreigners who live abroad. We believe that everyone could be one day an immigrant, like Petra and Leonardo, or feel the same sense of solitude, family, desire of happiness.</p><p>To conclude, “Neighbors” is a show born between two continents, our goal is to spread it as much as we can. //</p><p></p><p>Il denaro che donerete ci permetterà di realizzare un progetto che abbiamo iniziato oramai quasi due anni fa. Crediamo profondamente in questo spettacolo: spassoso, personale ed emotivo. E il pubblico potrà davvero simpatizzare con Petra e Leonardo. Inoltre, parlando della vita all'estero, abbiamo l'opportunità di dare voce ai giovani italiani e stranieri che vivono all'estero. Riteniamo che, un giorno, chiunque potrebbe emigrare o provare lo stesso senso di solitudine, di esigenza di famiglia e desiderio di felicità.</p>
<p>Infine, “Neighbors”  è uno spettacolo nato fra due continenti: la nostra speranza è intercontinentale. Speriamo di diffonderlo il più possibile. </p><br/><p></p><p>WHAT ARE OUR COSTS?</p><p>In <b>April </b>and<b> May 2014</b> the show will be performed in Italy (<b>Padoa, Milan and Rome</b>). After that first italian tour, our final destination will be performing <b>“Neighbors”</b> in NYC during season 2014/2015. Of course the show will be in Italian in Italy and in English in U.S. So, we have calculated 5000 dollars to give birth to Neighbors”. We know it's a big amount of money and we are ambitious, but it's not simple to create a show between two continents without a rich production to cover all the expenses. And for this reason we really need your help!</p><p>Costs that you are contributing toward include:</p><ul>
<li><p>a part of the flight from NY to Italy (and of course to come back!)</p></li>
<li><p>the set design, the costumes, the space to rehearse (Ilaria's place is so cool, but a bit tiny)</p></li>
<li><p>the people who are working on this project: set designer, musicians, light designer, cinematographer, camera operator, graphic designer. At least, if it is possible, the director and the actors.</p></li>
<li><p>the transportation between the different cities (by car and train)</p></li>
<li><p>the urban transportation and the normal expenses of a tournee.</p></li>
<li><p>the rights for the music and for the play.</p></li>
<li><p>And we hope to find in every theatre a couch, the fundamental set design of our show, without which we cannot perform...so we are optimistic, but actually we are not sure about that possibility!</p></li>
</ul><p>A LOT OF PERKS FOR YOU! //</p><p></p><p></p><p>In aprile e maggio 2014, lo spettacolo verrà portato in scena in Italia (Padova, Milano e Roma). Dopo questo primo tour italiano, la nostra destinazione finale sarà  New York, nel corso della stagione 2014/2015. Per questo lo spettacolo verrà recitato in italiano in Italia e in inglese in America. Perciò, abbiamo stimato 5000 dollari per dar vita al nostro spettacolo. Siamo consapevoli che si tratta di una somma ingente e che il progetto è molto ambizioso: non è affatto semplice creare uno spettacolo tra due continenti, senza una ricca produzione alle spalle che copra le spese. Proprio per questo motivo abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto!</p>
<p>I costi a cui state contribuendo includono:</p>
<ul>
<li>una parte del viaggio d'areo da NY all'Italia (e ovviamente il seguente ritorno)</li>
<li>la scenografia, i costumi, lo spazio dove poter provare (la casa di Ilaria è davvero cool ma un po' troppo piccola)</li>
<li>Le persone che stanno lavorando dietro a questo progetto: la scenografa, i musicisti, il light designer, la regista video, il primo operatore video, la graphic designer, Infine, qualora si riesca, la regista e gli attori.</li>
<li>I viaggi tra le varie città (via treno e via macchina)</li>
<li>I mezzi di trasporto in città e le normali spese di tournée </li>
<li>I diritti per le musiche e per il testo</li>

They are opposite in terms of way of living, but they have something very important in common: they are both diasporic souls, products of a generation with no sure values, jobs and sentimental relationships. And they are both in NYC.Through this anti romantic comedy, you follow their brilliant and often funny dialogues, sharing their perspectives on sex, relationships and work. //Ci piace descrivere “Neighbors” come un viaggio verso avventure urbane, situazioni assurde e intime solitudini, vissute da due immigrati italiani a New York. Petra e Leonardo, questi sono i nomi dei protagonisti, si incontrano come vicini a New York. Entrambi decidono di aprire le loro porte e di sbirciare nella vita dell'altro. Sono agli antipodi in quanto a stile di vita, ma hanno qualcosa di molto importante in comune: sono entrambi animi in fuga, prodotti di una generazione senza una sicura stabilità rispetto a valori, lavori e  amori. E poi sono entrambi a NYC...
Nel corso di questa commedia anti-romantica, seguirete il loro scambi, spesso brillanti e divertenti, affezionandovi alla loro prospettiva sul sesso, sulle relazioni d'amore e sui lavori.BEHIND “NEIGHBORS”Many great love stories are born from friendships, but is this the case? Or, to put it in a better way, is a romantic relationship what Petra and Leo really need now? Or is it a sense of family? What are these two character looking for in each other?It's very difficult to find the answer. You'll have to see the show to understand the nature of their relationship... Our point is to make you reflect about friendship, love and family. And about the thousands different ways a honest relationship could go! There is a delicate and fine line between all these different ways. With “Neighbors” we tell their story, that tries to be personal and universal at the same time . //Svariate importanti storie d'amore sono nate in seguito ad un rapporto di amicizia: ma in questo caso? O meglio, Petra e Leonardo hanno davvero bisogno di una relazione d'amore in questo momento? O forse è di un senso di famiglia? Cosa cercano questi personaggi l'uno nell'altro?
E' davvero difficile trovare un risposta. Dovete vedere lo spettacolo, per capire la natura di questo rapporto...Quello che cerchiamo di fare, è far riflettere sull'amicizia, l'amore e la famiglia. E sulle migliaia di strade che un rapporto tra due persone può imboccare. Esiste un delicato confine tra tutte queste possibili strade. Con “Neighbors” raccontiamo il loro percorso, che aspira ad essere, allo stesso tempo, personale ed universale.HOW DID THE PROJECT START? // ORIGINI DEL PROGETTOThe show naturally has been developed in parallel to our real diasporic life.In 2012 the actors and playwrights, Irene Turri and Francesco Meola, moved to New York, where they experienced a lot of adventures - the source of inspiration of the show. In 2013 they met the director Ilaria Ambrogi who said:""this play spoke of us, of all of us. Even in all our different lifestyles or habits, it speaks of us in a profound way: of our sense of family and of our lack of it. Of our struggle in being able to commit or love in a mature way, and our infinite capacity for love. It speaks about our generation, especially of us who live overseas.""So she decided to direct the play, becoming the third parent of this project.After many and many drafts, and after months and months of rehearsal in the little Ilaria's place in NYC, they involved a whole crew of very talented artists and friends, whose collaborations were fundamental to formalize the project.So, step by step, they created “Neighbors” and a little and lovely family behind it.In an overall perspective, these different paths could not help to cross each other.  We are inevitably connected since we share the same goals, dreams, struggles and feelings as emigrated young talents. //Il progetto è nato in parallelo alle nostre vite migranti. Nel 2012 gli attori e autori del testo, Irene Turri e Francesco Meola, si sono spostati a New York dove hanno vissuto una caterva di avventure, vera fonte di ispirazione dello spettacolo. Nel 2013 hanno incontrato la regista Ilaria Ambrogi che disse:
“Questo spettacolo parla di noi, di tutti noi. Nonostante i nostri diversi stili di vita e abitudini, lo spettacolo ci rispecchia nel profondo: nel nostro senso di famiglia e nella sua assenza. Del nostro sforzo di impegnarci e amare in maniera matura, e della infinità predisposizione all'amore. Parla della nostra generazione, in particolar modo di chi vive al di là dell'oceano.” (La citazione è stata veramente registrata in un giorno afoso di luglio, su uno dei tavolini verdi di Union Square, verso le 5.30 PM)
Così ha deciso di dirigere questo progetto, divenendo a pieno titolo il suo terzo papà/mamma.
Dopo svariate versioni e svariati mesi di prove all'interno del piccolo appartamento di Ilaria a New York, i tre si sono avvalsi di un gruppo di talentuosi artisti e amici, la cui collaborazione si è rivelata fondamentale per dare forma compiuta al progetto.
Passo dopo passo, hanno creato “Neighbors”, dietro a cui è cresciuta una piccola ma amorevole famiglia.
In una prospettiva più ampia, i loro percorsi non potevano non incrociarsi. Siamo inevitabilmente legati, in quanto condividiamo obiettivi, sogni, battaglie e emozioni da talenti emigrati / cervelli in fuga.WHY  TO DONATE? // PERCHE' DONARE?The money you donate allows us to make true and possible this project we initiated almost 2 years ago. We strongly believe in our show: hilarious, personal and emotional. And the audience can really sympathize with Petra and Leonado. Talking about their life abroad, we have a chance to give a voice to many young italians and foreigners who live abroad. We believe that everyone could be one day an immigrant, like Petra and Leonardo, or feel the same sense of solitude, family, desire of happiness.To conclude, “Neighbors” is a show born between two continents, our goal is to spread it as much as we can. //Il denaro che donerete ci permetterà di realizzare un progetto che abbiamo iniziato oramai quasi due anni fa. Crediamo profondamente in questo spettacolo: spassoso, personale ed emotivo. E il pubblico potrà davvero simpatizzare con Petra e Leonardo. Inoltre, parlando della vita all'estero, abbiamo l'opportunità di dare voce ai giovani italiani e stranieri che vivono all'estero. Riteniamo che, un giorno, chiunque potrebbe emigrare o provare lo stesso senso di solitudine, di esigenza di famiglia e desiderio di felicità.
Infine, “Neighbors”  è uno spettacolo nato fra due continenti: la nostra speranza è intercontinentale. Speriamo di diffonderlo il più possibile. WHAT ARE OUR COSTS?In April and May 2014 the show will be performed in Italy (Padoa, Milan and Rome). After that first italian tour, our final destination will be performing “Neighbors” in NYC during season 2014/2015. Of course the show will be in Italian in Italy and in English in U.S. So, we have calculated 5000 dollars to give birth to Neighbors”. We know it's a big amount of money and we are ambitious, but it's not simple to create a show between two continents without a rich production to cover all the expenses. And for this reason we really need your help!Costs that you are contributing toward include:
a part of the flight from NY to Italy (and of course to come back!)
the set design, the costumes, the space to rehearse (Ilaria's place is so cool, but a bit tiny)
the people who are working on this project: set designer, musicians, light designer, cinematographer, camera operator, graphic designer. At least, if it is possible, the director and the actors.
the transportation between the different cities (by car and train)
the urban transportation and the normal expenses of a tournee.
the rights for the music and for the play.
And we hope to find in every theatre a couch, the fundamental set design of our show, without which we cannot perform...so we are optimistic, but actually we are not sure about that possibility!
A LOT OF PERKS FOR YOU! //In aprile e maggio 2014, lo spettacolo verrà portato in scena in Italia (Padova, Milano e Roma). Dopo questo primo tour italiano, la nostra destinazione finale sarà  New York, nel corso della stagione 2014/2015. Per questo lo spettacolo verrà recitato in italiano in Italia e in inglese in America. Perciò, abbiamo stimato 5000 dollari per dar vita al nostro spettacolo. Siamo consapevoli che si tratta di una somma ingente e che il progetto è molto ambizioso: non è affatto semplice creare uno spettacolo tra due continenti, senza una ricca produzione alle spalle che copra le spese. Proprio per questo motivo abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto!
I costi a cui state contribuendo includono:

una parte del viaggio d'areo da NY all'Italia (e ovviamente il seguente ritorno)
la scenografia, i costumi, lo spazio dove poter provare (la casa di Ilaria è davvero cool ma un po' troppo piccola)
Le persone che stanno lavorando dietro a questo progetto: la scenografa, i musicisti, il light designer, la regista video, il primo operatore video, la graphic designer, Infine, qualora si riesca, la regista e gli attori.
I viaggi tra le varie città (via treno e via macchina)
I mezzi di trasporto in città e le normali spese di tournée 
I diritti per le musiche e per il testo
Inoltre, per ogni città e teatro in cui andremo, speriamo di trovare un divano da usare: per noi è davvero importante, perchè è l'elemento essenziale della nostra scenografia, senza cui lo spettacolo non si può fare. Siamo ottimisti, ma non completamente sicuri che questa eventualità si realizzi.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<i>Floyd Collins </i>is the true story of a cave explorer named Floyd who becomes trapped during one of his expeditions.  This musical follows Floyd and his family and friends as they come to terms with this catastrophic event.  Set in 1925 Kentucky, this show utilizes rustic, folk-like music in order to bring the audience into the world of the southern countryside.  </div><div>
<h3></h3>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/862483/files/20140916165059-DSC_0060.JPG?1410911459"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>Our Production</h3>
</div><div>One aspect of this script that we are exploring is the idea of hope and faithfulness.  
From the moment Floyd first becomes trapped in the cave, he struggles to stay calm.  He clearly understands the gravity
of the situation and and it becomes difficult for him to remain hopeful.  Other characters such as Floyd's brother Homer, Floyd's sister
Nellie, his father, a neighboring kid, and even a news reporter named Miller
struggle to maintain hope as well.  Despite their personal struggle to maintain hope, those close to Floyd also work to help Floyd keep his hopes up in an effort to remain faithful to him.  </div><div><br/></div><div>As the story goes on, Floyd battles with fears of death and loneliness and even starts hallucinating about his
escape. The play takes many moments to flash back to the earlier days of Floyd’s
life with his brother Homer. These contrasting scenes show the hope and
aspirations Floyd had for his life and serve to distract Floyd from his current
situation. Everyone tries to keep Floyd occupied in an effort to help him stay hopeful. One of the most moving parts of this musical is the ability of everyone to put aside their own fears in order to maintain hope for
Floyd’s escape. In trying situations, people sometimes have to shove emotions
aside to keep the flame burning in someone else. Anyone can give in to despair
or fear, but it takes a greater strength in order to keep fighting.  By focusing on the relationships between Floyd and the people outside of the cave in rehearsal, we hope to bring this theme of hopefulness to light for the audience.  </div><div><br/></div><div>

<p>We are <strong>Rhum and Clay</strong>, a touring theatre company that presents playful, physical work to a broad audience.</p>
<p>Thanks for watching this short video explaining why we need your help.</p>
<p><em>A Strange Wild Song </em>is our second show as Rhum and Clay and we will be touring with it in the spring of 2013.</p>
<p>The show is about three abandoned children in a bombed-out French village during World War II. They encounter a lost American soldier and they form a friendship. In the present day, the soldier’s camera is discovered by an amateur archaeological society and with the soldier’s grandson, they attempt to discover exactly what happened. There’s lots of humour, silent comedy and general silliness, with some touching, sad bits too.</p>
<p>The show is performed by Julian Spooner, Matt Wells, Daniel Wilcox and Chris Harrisson. There’s also a live musical accompaniment by Laila Woozeer. Set design is by Alberta Jones, with technical operations on tour by Rob Stenson and Aella Jordan-Edge. We are produced by Sarah Wilson.</p>
<p>We first performed the production at Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2012 and it was a big success; we got some great reviews and frequently sold out during the run. We also did a residency with the show at the Bike Shed Theatre in Exeter last November, which was great and meant we could show our work to more audiences. Now we want to share <em>A Strange Wild Song</em> with audiences across the country. We’ll be performing in Bath, London, rural Devon and Cornwall, finishing up in Liverpool. We’ll also be performing a one-off of our previous show Shutterland in Hay-on-Wye.</p>
<p>All the dates for our tour are on our website: <strong><a href=""http://www.rhumandclay.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rhumandclay.com</a></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money from this project will go to <strong>van and car hire</strong> for the month we’re touring which means we’ll be able to get from A to B with all our set and show audiences a show we know they’ll love. There’s a lot of set and musical instruments to move around as we tour the show that’s why we need to hire a van and a car. We’ll be driving for a total of around 28 hours during the tour, sometimes going out to very rural areas that are difficult to reach. Touring a show is an expensive undertaking and there are countless things we have to pay for before we even get on the road. We already done a great deal of fundraising to cover these costs but we need some extra help to get there.</p>
<p>If you donate to this campaign, you'll receive a reward from us to say thank you. These range from a thank you on our website to free tickets and postcards from the tour to posters designed by talented illustrator Sandra Dieckmann.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the full goal, the money will still go towards the van and car hire, as even a small amount will help us get on the road.</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to watch this video and read this description. We are passioante about the theatre we make and want to share it with as many people as we possibly can, including some areas with less easy access to theatre.

Mortall Coile Theatre Company is the brainchild of Jesse R. Gephart, an actor/director/producer in Raleigh, NC. The first production was the acclaimed Nocturne by Adam Rapp in 2013.  
The Pride by Alexi Kaye Campbell marks the second production for the company and we could not be more excited to bring together this amazingly talented group of friends who haven't been on stage together since 2009.  
This show also re-connects Gephart and Ryan Brock; they first met in 2006, when they played Jamie and Ste in a production of Beautiful Thing by Jonathan Harvey. They went on to co-star in several productions, though they may best be remembered for playing Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold in columbinus by Stephen Karam & PJ Paparelli in 2007. Later, in 2012,  they were George and Lennie in Of Mice & Men, which Jesse also directed. The duo have garnered collective praise from both critics and audiences alike.
   Theatre's Expensive, but You Can Be Rewarded! We're not going to sugar coat it: we need $5,000.
Why that much? Because, quite simply, theatre is expensive.  Here are some of the things on which we will be spending our raised funds: 


Performance & Rental Space
Royalties
Set & Lights
Props
Costumes
Sound
Marketing/Publicity

We will use every penny donated to fulfill our budgets and make this the best possible show we can, in every aspect. Know that any extra funds left over after the show closes will be put in reserve and used for future Mortall Coile productions.

Why Should You Give? Because we need you! This project cannot happen without your help. We're also offering some really fun rewards for our donors. Here's a taste:


High fives
Discounted tickets
Listings in our Program and/or poster
Signed memorabilia 
Meet-and-greets
Invitations to rehearsals
AND MORE!

Every donor level comes with its own awesome set of rewards. Also included: the satisfaction of knowing you helped our dream become reality, as well as our unending gratitude.


    Why THE PRIDE? Jesse saw the off-Broadway production of this show in 2010 and it left a real impression on him. It's a show about love and betrayal; beyond that, it's a show about the history we grow out of. It's about how we take that history and use it - for good, and for bad - in our current lives.
The UK tour bills the show as: ""Philip, Oliver and Sylvia exist in a complex love triangle which spans over half a century, living and loving simultaneously in 1958 and the present against a background of changing attitudes towards homosexuality. 
Past and present worlds grind together and melt apart, yet the future and its promise of sexual liberation remains ever elusive, as societal repression gives way to self-deception. The Pride is Alexi Kaye Campbell's hilarious and heart-felt landmark play about courage, compassion and the fear of loneliness in life’s journey towards self-discovery.""
At the end of it all, the show strives to shed some light on this question: ""What is the point of this stupid, painful life if not to be honest?  If not to stand up for what one is in the core of one's being?"" (Campbell, The Pride, p. 50).
    
Risks & Challenges With every endeavor, there is the possibility for failure. We all hope this doesn't happen. We will work tirelessly to ensure that we clear every hurdle that may arise. Your donations will help us overcome many of the obstacles we already see on our horizon.
Should we encounter unknown snags, we will band together and work for the best solution. We will ask for help when needed, and we will always act in the best interest of the production, its designers and cast, as well as those who funded us.

    How Else Can You Help? If you're unable to contribute monetarily, we understand. We just thank you for taking the time to check out our campaign. Please know that no contribution is too small! We will gladly accept any donation you are able to give.

<p>Sadly, today’s youngsters will not have that experience.  They will not know what it feels like to belong to a group of people that share a common goal of pulling off the spectacular feat that is live theatre.  Our education and civic budgets are cut to the bare minimum with no room for extras such as theatre programs.  School plays are not being produced, music and art are being slashed from the curriculum.  An entire generation of our kids are not being introduced to theatre arts, music or culture of any kind.  And we at the Glove Performing Arts Center, think that is tragic.  </p>
<p>But, with your help we can do something about it!  We have, right here in Fulton County, New York, a fully functional Theatre just oozing with history and culture.  The theatre will turn 100 in 2014!  As you can imagine, it takes resources to keep these old doors open. We get no funding from the state or local governments, they are stretched to the limit just providing for the basic needs of our community, ranked among the poorest in New York State.  We have been fortunate with some small grants and trusts but nothing like what it takes to keep going.  This grand space could be a solid economic driver for our area but first we need to shine it up and dress it for a big debut!  We have an all-volunteer staff ready to do the job, expecting nothing in return but to enjoy quality entertainment and have the place bursting with kids who we know will be the performers and patrons of tomorrow. </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Please remember your experience being introduced to the performing arts and how much it means to you now and give to help the Glove stay open for the next generation.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Gloversville is a struggling upstate NY community. Population 15,656, Median Income $30,741 Unemployment 10.6%. Yes we are the home of the Ice Cream Wars. The Glove Performing Arts Center building will be 100 years next year. We at the Glove Performing Arts Center are trying to rehabilitate this old theatre, keep it open and try to give the local people shows at a price they can afford.</p>
<p>The Glove is going “green” this July. The Glove Performing Arts Center needs your help with funding for our ambitious production of Shrek the Musical.  Shrek: The Musical follows the adventure of everyone’s favorite ogre and his talkative donkey in his daring rescue of a fiery red headed princess, for a sleazy “short” tempered lord wannabe king in order to obtain the deed to his swamp.  The swamp with has been intruded by evicted fairy tale creatures looking for their happy ending.  This musical is fully comedy, drama, romance, and just downright entertainment. The production is complete with an extremely talented group of local actors.  This energized musical is full of magical characters, evil villains, and a story line that will make you laugh, cry, belch, flatulate, and whatever bodily function you can think of.  Your contribution will help with the heavy costuming, complex make-up designs, and ambitious scenery.  The Glove has recently begun bringing highly praised productions to our community including Wizard of Oz and Hand in Glove’s recent productions of Annie and Into the Woods.  Shrek is bound to be a spectacular production. We just need your help to make our dream a reality. Please help us support community theatre and help us bring Shrek to Gloversville this July and discover the Glove!</p>

</span></p></div>","Remember when you were in the school play?  Remember how you felt with the lights in your eyes and the butterflies in your stomach?  Can you hear the thunderous applause?  Then maybe later on you joined a college group and had some unforgettable experiences working hard towards a performance, what a thrill, right?  Sure, that helped you.  It gave you confidence and maturity and you made friends that have lasted a lifetime. 
Sadly, today’s youngsters will not have that experience.  They will not know what it feels like to belong to a group of people that share a common goal of pulling off the spectacular feat that is live theatre.  Our education and civic budgets are cut to the bare minimum with no room for extras such as theatre programs.  School plays are not being produced, music and art are being slashed from the curriculum.  An entire generation of our kids are not being introduced to theatre arts, music or culture of any kind.  And we at the Glove Performing Arts Center, think that is tragic.  
But, with your help we can do something about it!  We have, right here in Fulton County, New York, a fully functional Theatre just oozing with history and culture.  The theatre will turn 100 in 2014!  As you can imagine, it takes resources to keep these old doors open. We get no funding from the state or local governments, they are stretched to the limit just providing for the basic needs of our community, ranked among the poorest in New York State.  We have been fortunate with some small grants and trusts but nothing like what it takes to keep going.  This grand space could be a solid economic driver for our area but first we need to shine it up and dress it for a big debut!  We have an all-volunteer staff ready to do the job, expecting nothing in return but to enjoy quality entertainment and have the place bursting with kids who we know will be the performers and patrons of tomorrow. 
Please remember your experience being introduced to the performing arts and how much it means to you now and give to help the Glove stay open for the next generation.
Gloversville is a struggling upstate NY community. Population 15,656, Median Income $30,741 Unemployment 10.6%. Yes we are the home of the Ice Cream Wars. The Glove Performing Arts Center building will be 100 years next year. We at the Glove Performing Arts Center are trying to rehabilitate this old theatre, keep it open and try to give the local people shows at a price they can afford.
The Glove is going “green” this July. The Glove Performing Arts Center needs your help with funding for our ambitious production of Shrek the Musical.  Shrek: The Musical follows the adventure of everyone’s favorite ogre and his talkative donkey in his daring rescue of a fiery red headed princess, for a sleazy “short” tempered lord wannabe king in order to obtain the deed to his swamp.  The swamp with has been intruded by evicted fairy tale creatures looking for their happy ending.  This musical is fully comedy, drama, romance, and just downright entertainment. The production is complete with an extremely talented group of local actors.  This energized musical is full of magical characters, evil villains, and a story line that will make you laugh, cry, belch, flatulate, and whatever bodily function you can think of.  Your contribution will help with the heavy costuming, complex make-up designs, and ambitious scenery.  The Glove has recently begun bringing highly praised productions to our community including Wizard of Oz and Hand in Glove’s recent productions of Annie and Into the Woods.  Shrek is bound to be a spectacular production. We just need your help to make our dream a reality. Please help us support community theatre and help us bring Shrek to Gloversville this July and discover the Glove!

</div><div>The show was first entered as part of the Durham Drama Festival 2013, where it won three awards including 'Best Play', 'Best Actor' and 'Best Supporting Actor'. The show was then performed again in February 2014 and won 'Best Comedy' at the Durham Student Theatre Awards 2014.

<p><b><u>Props:</u></b></p>
<p>The production contains lots of handheld props that are used in conjunction with the violent aspects of the show. These include a blowtorch, screwdrivers, pliers and fake knives. All the violence is light-hearted in nature, however we aim to make everything as realistic as possible which gradually becomes more of a financial challenge. The show also contains various consumable items, such as smarties, spring rolls and lots of tea. Providing these across 17 performances and rehearsals also proves costly. </p>
<p><b><u>Visual Effects:</u></b></p>
<p>Within the show we get through a lot of fake blood. With publicising the show everyday on the Royal Mile and with every performance, we expect to use approximately 5-7 litres of the stuff!

<p><b><u>Fringe Publicity:</u></b></p>
<p>Any successful production at the Fringe places a large emphasis on publicising the show on the Royal Mile and around Edinburgh. As a result, the number of flyers and posters required is always very high.

<p>Hi! My name is <a href=""http://amicahunter.wix.com/clown"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://amicahunter.wix.com/clown"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amica Hunter</a>, and I am a 21 year old female clown and circus performer living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have been an artist all my life - painting, sculpting, acting, and storytelling, but above all, clowning is my passion. There is nothing quite like connecting with a live audience and providing meaningful and entertaining ways of showing people how to laugh at ourselves. After training acrobatics, stilt walking, unicycle, and aerials arts while in school in Portland, OR, I left the university to pursue performance full time at the Circus Center in San Francisco. It was the best decision I've ever made. Now I want to further my professional training so that I can turn my calling into a career that supports me. </p>
<p>After touring street theater festivals in Europe this summer with my company <a href=""http://alittlebitoff.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://alittlebitoff.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A Little Bit Off</a>, it was time to take the next step, so I applied to Ecole Philippe Gaulier - a physical theater school in Etampes, France. Ecole Philippe Gaulier has a 35 year legacy of unique, quality instruction, and has produced many successful performers and comedians from around the world, like Sacha Baron Cohen for example. Attending this school will strengthen me as a physical comedian, give me invaluable experience, and allow me to make strong professional connections. The school offers a two year program that begins in October 2014 covering all of the subjects that I want to study. I have been accepted to the program. I'm on my way to getting my student visa. Only one crucial factor is missing. TUITION!</p>
<p>I need to raise approximately $9,448 just to cover my first year’s tuition, plus $500-$700 for Indiegogo's fees. I have been working hard to save up for housing and other living expenses for my stay in France, but tuition for the first year of school is due in full on the first day of classes. I need your help!</p><h3>What I Need </h3><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;""></span></p>
<p>Ecole Philippe Gaulier costs 6,900 Euros per year. That is about 9,500 US dollars for the first year program. No scholarships or government aid are offered for covering the cost, but considering the quality of instruction, variety of classes, and hours per day, it is a remarkably reasonable price for a professional theatrical education. Unfortunately, it isn’t something I can afford on my own. If I meet my funding goal Indiegogo will extract about $700 in fees, which is why I set my goal for $10,000. I am relying on my own savings for housing, food, and transportation while in Etampes, so every dollar raised here will go straight to paying for tuition.</p>
<p>For this campaign, I am only focusing on rounding up enough money to attend the first year of the program. I set my goal $552 higher to account for the $700 of fees that Indiegogo will collect if I meet it. </p><p>If, with your help, I am able to exceed my goal of $10,000, I will set aside the extra funds to go towards paying my second year’s tuition at Ecole Philippe Gaulier.</p>
<p>If I fall short of the goal, the money I do make (minus a 9% collection by Indiegogo) will still be put directly into my tuition fund, and I will have to come up with other ways to fulfill the amount. I am determined to make this work!</p><p></p><h3>What You Get</h3><p></p>

<p>The incredible thing about live performance in this increasingly virtual world of ours is not just the energy you feel both on stage and in the audience, it’s not just the absence of a “pause,” “rewind,” or “delete” button. Live performance offers the precious opportunity for real exchanges. It gives us a chance to really look closely at each other and make impressions. That is what clowning is all about - being WITH the audience. </p>
<p>My passion for creating bizarre, quirky, and endearing physical comedy performance is fueled by a belief that connecting people through shared laughter and curiosity is important work. It is a vital way to foster awareness and growth in communities, and a wonderful opportunity to suspend one’s grim adulthood, and reawaken the imagination. I thrive on the experience of relating to and delighting an audience even if it is through very obscure means. Clowning for me is bringing relief to the tension of the world, and it is my dream is to find new and better ways of accomplishing this task.</p>
<p>I have learned that the best way for me to learn, improve, and push myself is through instruction. I have done a lot of research and put a lot of intention into my performance education thus far, and I know that Ecole Philippe Gaulier is the next step I should take to reach my goals. While the financial aspects are daunting (and let’s be real, the uprooting and the language barrier are scary too), I know that this is the most important and beneficial thing I can do to become a better performer for YOU and for the WORLD to watch and enjoy.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you can't afford to contribute in dollars or euros, I totally understand.

<p>     When I was 18, I moved to Dresden, Germany to attend Palucca Schule - Hochschule für Tanz, under the direction of Jason Beechey. I came away from that year with improved technique, strength, and insight in to my dancing, but with a lot of internal frustration with dance as well. I moved back home and announced I had quit dancing forever. Then I started salsa dancing.     <br/><br/>     Salsa dancing was incredible for me. I had always loved dancing, but this was the first time I truly felt free to allow myself to enjoy dance for what it truly is: a release and escape from the limitations one puts on oneself; a freedom initiated from within a piece of music and/or emotion which allows us to connect with our souls and those around us. With time, I realized I could apply the exact same intent to my contemporary and ballet dancing as I did in salsa; so I came back. <br/><br/>     Since returning to my contemporary and ballet roots, I have completed a season with Lamondance, am currently in my second, and have taught and choreographed at a local dance school. I have also taken acting classes, filmed a few TV commercials and a short film. I work in a restaurant, allow myself to date, socialize... in short, I have allowed myself to experience life outside of the studio. <br/><br/>     I used to think being a dancer was all about perfect technique, eating-breathing-sleeping dance. However, I now realize just how important experiencing other things in life is, and just how much it broadens one's dancing ability. Without ever falling in love with someone, kissing someone, feeling that connection with another being, how can one truly show love to one's audience? How can one portray internal angst, or pure happiness, or a mélange of emotions, without ever having experienced them?  How can one allow oneself to be free onstage if one hasn’t allowed oneself to be free in real life?  With gaining maturity in my life, I have gained maturity within my dancing. Dancing has a different texture to me now; it feels different, and it feels good.</p>
<p>___________________________________________</p>
<p>And a little bit more...<br/><br/>     When I first started teaching ballet, I felt hesitant; I hadn’t taken on a proper teaching job like this before, and now I had 60 students in my care, 9 hours a week.  I felt like there was a lot of responsibility attached to it.  I was teaching these young girls how to use their muscles, how to apply quality to their movement... teaching dance encompasses a whole lot more than simply explaining pliés and pirouettes.  I soon found I could, in fact, teach these students though.  Corrections were picked up quickly, and the use of imagery seemed to be extremely helpful when explaining certain techniques and steps.  When I would question the younger students about certain elements I had taught them the week before, it wasn’t surprising to have them holler my pointers back at me at an ear-splitting volume... they had definitely remembered what I had told them!  Watching the girls progress over the year was so satisfying... little changes slowly implemented themselves into bigger changes.  Just as importantly, the students that were rebellious and less responsive than their classmates at the beginning of the year were completely different and that much more excited about dancing.  I was sad when the year was over, but the cards and emails I have received {and continue to receive!} mean so much.<br/><br/>     I started teaching salsa in high schools this year.  I have taught students from grades 8-12, with as many as 90 under my instruction at once.  It’s quite fascinating actually.... I start the class off with footwork, standing at the front of the room with all the students in rows behind me.  Generally there will be a group of unruly students, usually boys but not always!, who congregate at the end of one of the lines.  For the first few minutes of the class, they goof off with their friends and make fun of the movement.  Yet by the end of the class, they have the footwork and partnering patterns down, and  are quiet and attentive; focused.  There might still be a little bit of goofing off happening, but for the most part, they’ve been hooked by the dancing.  This has happened to me numerous times, at different schools.  I’m not the only one that notices either.  I have had several teachers come up to me at the end of the class and comment on how well behaved and focused the students were.  It just goes to show how powerful dancing can be!</p></div>","“Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.

<p><b>We are a married actor-couple, together for 15 years and counting.</b>  Over seven years ago, we got the idea to create our own theater piece about <b>the greatest theatrical actor-couple of all time</b>, “The Lunts,” <b>Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne</b>.  That started us on an incredible journey of research (including a private tour at their Wisconsin home,<b> Ten Chimneys</b>), writing and re-writing, and finally a script: <b><i>LUNT AND FONTANNE: The Celestials of Broadway</i></b>.  After getting a fabulous director, <b>Owen Thompson</b>, and gifted production team on board, we had a short workshop run of the play at a small theater in New York City, in May 2015.</p>
<p>This is a dream project for us, so we want to continue with this play... get it out there, to theater festivals, regional theaters, colleges... and that will cost some money.  We already have a great start in 2016, with invitations to bring the show to a theater in <b>San Antonio, Texas</b> and a slot in the <b>20th New York International Fringe Festival</b>!  Other theaters have expressed interest, but the more we perform and create buzz, the more bookings will materialize.  The 2015 performances already cost us a few bucks, so we’re counting on theater lovers (and theater history lovers) to help us continue producing this new and exciting play.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Help us bring The Lunts back on stage!</h3> <p></p>
<p>Being in the business for over twenty years, we know how to do this, but <b>making theater costs money</b>, and the box office only covers a portion of the expenses... we need to pay our team (director, stage manager, etc.) as well as designers, costumes, props, set pieces, rehearsal studio fees, and a professional publicist to get the word out to audiences, critics and the media about the show.</p>
<p><b>Check out the fun perks</b> we are offering donors to the cause: everything from official show Fridge Magnets and signed 1930s Lunt ""Taming of the Shrew"" posters, to our own Mark Edward Lang offering up a celebrity impression of your choice (anyone from Laurence Olivier to Marlon Brando to a world-class Captain Kirk).  And all donations are tax deductible! (see below)</p> </div> <div> <h3>Make a Difference...</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>Last May we sold out our entire New York run of the show</b>, with great response from the audiences.  We also chose not to invite critics the first time around, and it’s very important that our next New York run shows off the play in the best possible way... <b>your donations will help make this happen</b>.</p>
<p><b>We’re revved up and ready to bring this project to the next level</b>: from the New York Fringe to Philadelphia, Edinburgh and beyond!   Yes, it’s a great vehicle for us as actors (so there are selfish motives here), but it’s also a way to keep alive the legacy of two of the most famous stage actors of their time... two performers whose work has been almost completely forgotten by modern audiences... as they chose to act on stage and not on film.  </p>
<p>We cover <b>their incredible true story</b> from their meeting in the 1920s, through fame and stardom in the 1930s (as they go to Hollywood and try their hand at film acting), followed by their difficult decision to go to London in the midst of WWII bombing, and feeling passe as the new generation of actors, playwrights and directors gained prominence in the 1950s.  But at it’s core is <b>the strength of an unbreakable marriage</b>: a partnership that stood through all of the highs and lows, the adversity and arguments, and came through stronger than ever.</p>

<h3>PARTS UNKNOWN</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is David Reilly. I'm a comedian and writer based in Dublin, Ireland. I've written a play, my first, and it is going to be on in February as part of the Scene + Heard festival in Dublin's Smock Alley Theatre. The piece is called Parts Unknown and here's the blurb:</p>
<p><i>The sons of a wrestling legend clash over his legacy and the Good Friday referendum. The debut play from comedian Davey Reilly, starring Dermot Ward (Game of Thrones) and Pete O’Hanlon (Rocketman).</i></p>

<p>Parts Unknown is a huge labour of love for myself and the team. With your generous contribution and support, you will be helping towards the costs of rehearsal spaces, marketing &amp; promotion, lighting &amp; sound design, props &amp; transport, etc. If this run of Parts Unknown is successful, it will potentially allow us to develop it into a full length play, but to do that we need help from our community.</p>
<p>There are various tiers for you to choose from, each with their own perks.</p>
<p>You can keep up with the production on Instagram by following us @ArtIsHard, the theatre company I've set up for this, and future productions.</p>

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>Unassuming Mormon, Connor Jorgensen, becomes the center of national media frenzy when his tweets about a Mormon presidential candidate go viral. Inspired by comments the candidate allegedly made in a church meeting, Connor spreads his presidential pick’s views on “the gays, gangsters and bleeding hearts”, leading ambitious reporter Lydia Strout to his door.</p>
<p>As Lydia tries to find the man hiding behind the orthodox Mormon facade, and Connor navigates the unfamiliar world of Tweets, news feeds, and blogs, both are forced to confront the choice between living by facts or walking by faith.</p>
<p>At its core, #MormonInChief is about young people trying to figure out what they can believe in as they navigate a world full of technology, social media, news outlets, and faith. #MormonInChief addresses highly topical issues in a fresh, humorous, and often touching way.</p>
<p>Written by Matthew Greene, directed by Austin Regan, and performed by the very talented Jesse Liebman, Nicole Rodenburg, and Karis Danish, #MormonInChief will be performed at the New York International Fringe Festival from August 10-26, 2012. FringeNYC is one of the top 5 attended cultural events in NYC, and we are honored and excited to be part of such an amazing festival. But we need your help in order to make it happen!</p>

<h3>Our Amazing Team</h3>
<p><strong>Michael Holt,</strong> our fearless producer, is a producer, general manager and theater marketing consultant in NYC. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Business Management Marketing from Brigham Young University, he began working as a marketing associate for Hale Center Theater in Orem, Utah. Upon moving to NYC, Michael began collaborating with Lisa Dozier (Lisa Dozier Productions) on National Alliance for Musical Theater's Festival of New Musicals. He has been an assistant and associate general manager at LDP on off-off works including <em>Leave the Balcony Open</em> (3LD) and <em>Spring Alive!</em> (Dixon Place). Current projects include <em>A Letter to Harvey Milk</em> (NYMF) and <em>Swing State</em> (NYMF). Michael has been on staff at Stuart Thompson Productions, where he worked on the Tony Award winning <em>Death of a Salesman</em>, as well as last season's hit, <em>The Book of Mormon</em>. He's ecstatic to be able to bring the extraordinarily well written <em>#MormonInChief</em> to the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Greene</strong> is our talented playwright who grew up in California, graduated from Brigham Young University with a BA in Theater, and now lives in NYC. His plays have been produced all over the US. Although he and Michael both attended BYU at the same time, they didn't meet until they were both living in NYC, and started collaborating together. Matthew wrote <em>#MormonInChief</em> as he personally grappled with many of the themes from the play. Like many of his other plays, <em>#MormonInChief</em> deals with how young people address the issue of faith in their lives.  He's very excited to make his NYC premiere at FringeNYC.</p>
<p>Our director, <strong>Austin Regan</strong><em> </em>is extremely excited to be working on the piece. His recent work includes <em>It Started With A Dream</em> at the 92nd St. Y; <em>Bromance In Concert</em> at 92Y Tribeca; <em>Hey, You Know What...?</em> at the Julia Miles Theater and the Zipper Factory; and <em>The Who's Tommy</em> at the Boston Conservatory, where he also served on the faculty of the theater department. As Associate and Assistant Director, Austin has worked on Broadway (<em>On A Clear Day...; American Idiot; Everyday Rapture</em>), national tours, regional premieres, and at the Metropolitan Opera.</p>
<p>Together we've put together an amazing team of actors and designers, which you can learn about at our website, <a href=""http://www.mormoninchiefplay.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mormoninchiefplay.com</a></p>

<h3><strong>What Happens After Fringe</strong></h3>
<p>FringeNYC has been a launching pad for writers, actors, directors, and designers for the past 16 years, including the hit musical <em>Urinetown</em>, which made its premiere at Fringe in 2000 and became a Broadway sensation. We hope that Fringe will be a launching pad for our entire team, and allow doors to be opened for us all. YOU can be a part of making that possible by donating to our campaign. And when we have opportunities presented to us because of your support, you can trust that we will recognize YOU for making it possible.</p>

Our Story

In June of 2009, Katherine Craft started a theatre workshop for incarcerated women at the Travis County Correctional Complex in Del Valle, Texas.  To her surprise and delight, they loved it and for the next two years Katherine and the women, with the help of several other Austin artists, reflected on their lives, challenges, hopes, dreams and disappointments through the mediums of theatre and creative writing.Michelle Dahlenburg came on board as a co-facilitator and program developer in July of 2011, and with their powers combined, Katherine and Michelle have a plan to grow the organization, expand programming and eventually offer services to women in the free world as well in multiple jails and prisons in central Texas.  
The Impact

Quoted from a letter of support by the Social Services Program Coordinator at the Travis County Correctional Complex: 
Gender specific programs for incarcerated women are important because 
there is a growing recognition that women typically enter the system 
from different pathways than men...they come into the program trying to figure
 out how to end a substance dependence that has kept them in jail and 
away from their children.

The
 therapy addressing this substance abuse and post-traumatic stress is 
very difficult for them.  To give the women a way to 
express themselves in healthier and more positives ways, Conspire 
Theatre began their first group here in June of 2009. Conspire Theatre 
staff facilitates through a relaxed team building style that encourages 
self-discovery, creativity, and teamwork.Perhaps most important, is the fact that the women are exposed to a bigger
 world of literature, theatre and music that they have never had the 
opportunity to experience. No matter what their education level, the 
women are inspired to learn. 
Quotes from the women in our class:
“This is a wonderful class – it makes us forget that we are in stripes.  We actually feel free again.” “Thank you… I will never forget you guys.”“I believe this class has been a wonderful exercise and stress reliever.”“You all were a blessing to me despite of me being in jail.”

What We Need & What You Get
Our needs are simple: facilitators, class supplies and gas.  The amount we're raising is just the beginning - but it will help us get started.    We need great facilitators who know how to blend theatre and social work, and how to operate successfully in a stressful jail environment.  Supplies aren't much but they are important - colorful folders, pencils, markers, paper, flip charts and printing costs for our next chap book of women's writings.  The price of gas keeps going up and in central Texas, the jails and prisons are a good drive away from Austin.  WE do carpool but the cars can't run on love alone.  How we'll spend your money:
75% on facilitators' stipend through December
10% on program supplies, which includes another chapbook self-published by the end of 2011
10% for our sponsoring organization, which supports us in a number of ways and makes your contribution tax-deductible. 

5% on gas

<p><em>“Slowly, take it slowly. One thing after another one.”</em></p>
<p>An extremely prolific young playwright dies without completing one of his greatest masterpieces. <em>Woyzeck—</em>a terrifying play about the disastrous effects of human jealousy—lies incomplete, fragmented, and waiting for any artist crazy enough to take it on.

<p><em>“Is it not queer that he is thus bewitched?”</em></p>
<p>Before Shakespeare, Marlowe writes an epic tragedy about a young and naïve king and his obsession with his once banished lover.

<p><em>“All we’ve got is one another.”</em></p>
<p>A revival and reworking of one of TNTP’s most successful collaborations—a true reinvention of ourselves. In 1846, Phineas Gage suffers an accident that drives a three-foot iron rod through his skull. He recovers miraculously and entirely in almost no time but is described in the only brief news article about his case as “no longer Gage.” <em>The American Crowbar Case</em>, based on the concept album from Ann Arbor-based musicians Match by Match, imagines the life of Gage and the effects of the accident on his new wife Constance and a mysterious stranger known only as Missy.

For the Fringe performances we'll have a cast of 7 dancers, with artists
 from Philadelphia and New York performing together in these shows.  We've been developing this dance since November 2010 and will bring it 
to historic Washington Square park in Philadelphia this September.

<h3>Heres The Idea</h3>
<p> We (NathanaelT Productions LLC) want to pay artists. We all know them by name the guys and gals that get on stage an wow us with their talents! But do we know the situation? What if I were to tell you that on average each actor on that stage had to spend $300-$500 in expenses during the run of the show. You would think I was crazy. What do you mean they have to pay that much? Could you imagine having to shell out that kinda of money to get the chance just to do your job? Now what if I was to tell you that very few of them ever get reimbursed for that expense?""Where does the money go?"" you ask.  The money goes to things like gas, costumes, food, and other expenses just needed to get from the audition stage to the performance stage.</p>
<h3>The Math: </h3>
<p>Now your thinking well why don't we pay them? Don't I pay like $15 a ticket? There in lies the problem. The following is an example of where the money goes to an average non musical performance: Tickets in this area are $15 a piece on average for public use theaters being able to sit around 100 people a night. ($15 X 100 people = $1500 a night right?) Well not quite. Most theaters will require comps, lets average those to 5 people a night, shall we? ($15 per ticket X 95 people= $1,425 gross) thats only if we sell out, not very likely. Now lets say the show runs for two weekends at four nights a weekend to sold out crowds, thats (($1,425 gross X4 nights) X 2 weekends= $11,400) with average theater rental a night being $250 a night, and the show running for 8 performances that ($250 rental X 8 performances= $2,000 in rent) and the average performance rights fees totaling about $400 for that length of time  ($2,000 rent+ $400 rights = $2,400) Then add in the cost of props and set around another $4,000 depending on the show. ($2,400 rent and rights + $4,000 props and sets = $6,400) WOW thats a lot of money, but unfortunately we are not done yet. We still haven't gotten to costumes or lighting or advertising and printing cost. Lets lump those all together and conservatively say the total is $3,000. Honestly I've seen this go a lot higher. ($6,400 + $3,000 = $9,400 total cost). Now lets subtract what we owe from what we made, shall we? ( $11,400 gross profit - $9,400 cost= $2,000 net profit). $2,000 thats kinda sad, and remember this is the best case scenario. Thats with sold out crowds every night. Some Theater Companies lose money on most of their shows. This is really a labor of love.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Can Do:</h3>
<p>With all of the cost there really isn't any money left to pay the people that work so hard to bring us these shows, but we can all be a part of changing that. Your Donation will simply go to paying the artists, thats it! Nothing more, nothing less. Thats what we want to do is get them payed. Will you help?  </p>

<h3>ABOUT THE PROJECT</h3>
<div>
<p><em>Cloven Tongues </em>is a new play written by <strong>Victor Lesniewski.</strong></p>
<p>The show will have a <strong>three week run</strong> in <strong>November 2013</strong>, at <strong>The Wild Project.</strong></p>
<p><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Cloven Tongues</strong></span></em></p>
<p>Written by: <strong>Victor Lesniewski</strong><br/>Directed by: <strong>Michelle Bossy<br/></strong>Starring: <strong>Ema Lakovic</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Synopsis:</span></strong></p>
<p>When Lela, a woman with an unknown past, is arrested and held at the border, she is taken in by Jenny, a social worker, and Ronald, a priest, who find it takes nothing less than a miracle to unlock her deepest secrets.  As Lela's brutal personal history is revealed, Jenny and Ronald struggle with how best to heal her and find that they must also come to terms with their reasons for trying to help her in the first place.</p>
</div>
<div>A riveting drama about the effects of sex trafficking and war, <em>Cloven Tongues</em> is a fierce, biting play about the power and limitations of communication, altruism, and faith. Rendered with unapologetic grace, it is sure to be a compelling work of theater.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WHY WE NEED FUNDING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN</h3>
<p>This campaign is geared specifically toward raising the funds necessary for our <strong>venue rental</strong><strong> </strong>in order to house the production. The show will be presented at <strong>The Wild Project</strong> over three weeks in November 2013.<em><br/></em></p>
<p>Any funds we raise in excess of our goal will be held and applied to production costs including marketing, design execution, and artist remuneration.</p>
<p>It is our hope that this production will serve as a launchpad for these amazing emerging artists, and that this premiere of <em>Cloven Tongues</em> is just the beginning of a very long life for the play.</p>
<p>Because our producer, Lauren Rayner, is fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas, all donations are tax-deductible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone is in a position to give to this campaign. If you cannot help us out financially, please help us by spreading the word. Email this campaign to your friends, share us with your friends on Facebook or Twitter, and share us using your Indiegogo tools.</p>
<p>And, in just a few months, make sure to come out to the show! We're excited to see you there!</p>

When Lela, a woman with an unknown past, is arrested and held at the border, she is taken in by Jenny, a social worker, and Ronald, a priest, who find it takes nothing less than a miracle to unlock her deepest secrets.  As Lela's brutal personal history is revealed, Jenny and Ronald struggle with how best to heal her and find that they must also come to terms with their reasons for trying to help her in the first place.

A riveting drama about the effects of sex trafficking and war, Cloven Tongues is a fierce, biting play about the power and limitations of communication, altruism, and faith. Rendered with unapologetic grace, it is sure to be a compelling work of theater.


WHY WE NEED FUNDING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
This campaign is geared specifically toward raising the funds necessary for our venue rental in order to house the production. The show will be presented at The Wild Project over three weeks in November 2013.
Any funds we raise in excess of our goal will be held and applied to production costs including marketing, design execution, and artist remuneration.
It is our hope that this production will serve as a launchpad for these amazing emerging artists, and that this premiere of Cloven Tongues is just the beginning of a very long life for the play.
Because our producer, Lauren Rayner, is fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas, all donations are tax-deductible.


OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
We understand that not everyone is in a position to give to this campaign. If you cannot help us out financially, please help us by spreading the word. Email this campaign to your friends, share us with your friends on Facebook or Twitter, and share us using your Indiegogo tools.
And, in just a few months, make sure to come out to the show! We're excited to see you there!
