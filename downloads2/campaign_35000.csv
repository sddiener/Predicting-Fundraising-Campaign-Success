The same way having my business fall apart inspired me to go to school, having my grant money fall apart inspired me to search for more grants and scholarships.  I did my research, as I always do, and found many grants and scholarships.  The problem was, I didn’t qualify for any of them.  Still, that wouldn’t get me down.  However, I did start noticing things that were bothering me, so I researched further.
As it turns out, I don’t qualify for a “Multicultural Scholarship” because of my culture.  My first question was “How does a “culture” make a person “scholarly?”  Then I noticed what the qualifications were for this scholarship: It is available to all “non-Caucasians.”  This was an expected nuisance, but then I saw another scholarship, on the same page, that said it “wouldn’t be based on sex, color, race, creed, national origin, or any other illegal consideration.”  Why is it an illegal consideration for one scholarship and the entire basis for another one on the same page, from the same school?  That’s not even to mention all the scholarships and grants available to women.
I’m not a racist or a sexist.  Nor will I become one if I can’t afford school.  I understand that these grants were born of necessity in their day, and that the people that worked for them were striving for equality.  What no one seems to realize is that equality was never reached; they overshot the mark.  The ability to get an education is still based on race and sex unless you happen to be wealthy.  That’s how it’s always been throughout history, only the race and sex that are being discriminated against have changed.  As I researched more and more grants and scholarships, they are all aimed at high school students (which is understandable, so they can persuade them in), women, and minorities.  I assume it’s to persuade them in too, but do colleges really not want to persuade Caucasian men through their doors, or are they trying to imply that women and other ethnicities aren't as capable as Caucasian men, and therefore require the assistance?
I’m a good person that‘s trying to do something good, and I need your help.  Even if you can’t help me financially, please at least forward this link to your friends and post it on your Facebook page.  If I can double my goal (which is just enough to get me through the fall 2010 semester) by the deadline, I am going to try to start a nonprofit organization whose focus will be true equality in education.  Needless to say, donations of any size are not only helpful and appreciated, but help show the nation how many people are behind me on this.  Enough people will get media attention, and that’s the real way to get the changes made that bring equality.  Just $5 from 973 people will get me to my first goal; $10 from those same people will get all of us to my second goal.  Thank you for your contribution.

<p><em>Wedu invests in high-potential young women from underprivileged backgrounds in South-East Asia to attend university, so they become changemakers in their communities</em>.</p>
<p>Wedu is a registered UK Charity (No 1149494), founded in 2012 by Mario, Acumen Fund Fellow 2011 and Mari Sawai. We were proudly named <strong>Social Enterprise Startup of the Year 2012</strong> at Cambridge University's Business Plan Competition. Made possible by a <strong>global team spanning three continents</strong>, we currently operate in <strong>Cambodia</strong> and <strong>Myanmar</strong> from our base in Bangkok, Thailand.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p><em><strong>It all started...</strong> </em>with encountering and pondering the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forbes lists that <strong>only 2.4%</strong> of the US Fortune 500 CEOs in 2010 <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/2010/04/27/ceo-salaries-bonuses-global-companies-forbes-woman-leadership-boss-10-top-paid-female-chief-executives.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""CEO - a male business?"">were female</a>.</li>

<li>In some Developing Countries like Afghanistan, the ratio of <a href=""http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.ENR.TERT.FM.ZS/countries"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Gender Parity at University"">girls to boys</a> in university is a meager <strong>1 to 5</strong>.</li>
</ul><p><img alt=""This picture was taken during one of Wedu's workshop help in Phnom Penh (Cambodia) in August 2012. They are answering to the question whether they want to go to University or not."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/531793/pictures/original/20121110124107-4b.jpg?1352580070"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 5px 6px;"" title=""If you like Wedu stick your hand up!""/>Despite research showing that <strong>female leadership</strong> creates a more democratic society and higher gross national income, this disparity persists. Now consider how many talented women do not have <strong>access to college</strong> every year. How many potential future leaders would be among them? Leaders that would have the courage, passion, and brains to change the world around them?</p>
<p><strong>Think there’s something wrong with the system? Wedu. </strong></p>
<p><em>Not only does attending university train critical minds for individual empowerment, it is also <strong>a life-changing experience</strong></em><em> to better the life of an individual as well as those in their communities.</em></p>

<h2><strong>What do Wedu?</strong></h2>
<p><em>Our mission is to offer every high-potential leader the opportunity to instill change in their communities through powerful visions of positive change. </em></p>
<p>1- <strong>Find</strong> students with leadership potential and inspiring mentors using our network of field partners.</p>
<p>2- <strong>Provide</strong>: <br/>• <strong>Empowering life-long mentorship</strong>: most programs focus on getting students through university. We believe that catalyzing the blossoming of an individual takes more than that! We are developing a lifelong mentoring community where each mentor has a role in a phase of the life of the future leader. <br/>• <strong>Support to become a leader</strong> in business, government and civil society by providing leadership training and networking opportunities with remarkable individuals in the student’s field and country of interest.<br/>• <strong>Better finance</strong>: Based on students future income potential we provide loans or enter into income sharing agreements which are:<br/>o <strong>affordable</strong> for low interest rate, to minimize cost of capital,<br/>o <strong>flexible</strong>, matching student’s cash flow, <br/>o <strong>less risky</strong>, so student can focus on studies and leadership development. We match students’ risk profile with investors willing to bear that risk while investors can strike their balance between social and financial return. <br/>And if the student is really great but can’t pay back we have also scholarships. <br/>• <strong>Enhanced access</strong>: We partner with universities in emerging economies offering quality teaching at much lower cost than in OECD countries, guaranteeing high returns for graduates and minimizing brain drain.<br/>• <strong>Administrative consulting</strong>: Assisting with university applications, entrance examinations, access to locally available scholarships and funding.</p>
<p><br/>3-<strong> Incentivize students to return and give back</strong> by becoming mentors themselves and returning the funds received in our revolving fund to multiply impact while helping Wedu become sustainable.</p>

<p>Because getting young women into university to install positive change in their communities requires some serious construction work. With <strong>$25,000 USD</strong>, we will build the critical infrastructure required to support young leaders in developing countries.</p>

<p><em>""I have a diamond opportunity to know Wedu through Khmer Youth Association which I had volunteered during high school for over three years, leading a group of youth to work and assist the community development. [...] <strong>I believe in Wedu and I trust I can do it</strong>. Since I was young I have imagined of flying to study abroad and back with enough ability to change and help my country”.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] <strong>Wedu is my power mentor. Wedu helped me with my process of my application and my journey going abroad.</strong> [...] When I was 6 years old I did not have even rice to eat and I was a garbage collector. But, I have never given up. I struggled with all these things step by step. Once I am accepted to university I was very excited and I relaxed for five minutes before telling my parents, they were happier and put their arms around me and say they are lucky to be my parents. That was a very beautiful day in my life. They cannot speak English, but they told me to thanks in advance for Wedu that help supporting me, because they have never thought that one of their daughters can fly to study abroad, as I am now.""</em></p>

""I have a diamond opportunity to know Wedu through Khmer Youth Association which I had volunteered during high school for over three years, leading a group of youth to work and assist the community development. [...] I believe in Wedu and I trust I can do it. Since I was young I have imagined of flying to study abroad and back with enough ability to change and help my country”.
[...] Wedu is my power mentor. Wedu helped me with my process of my application and my journey going abroad. [...] When I was 6 years old I did not have even rice to eat and I was a garbage collector. But, I have never given up. I struggled with all these things step by step. Once I am accepted to university I was very excited and I relaxed for five minutes before telling my parents, they were happier and put their arms around me and say they are lucky to be my parents. That was a very beautiful day in my life. They cannot speak English, but they told me to thanks in advance for Wedu that help supporting me, because they have never thought that one of their daughters can fly to study abroad, as I am now.""

Be inspired by the story of Ly Chhay and join us on our journey towards developing local changemakers. THANK YOU.

I've been doing it for 8 years and have been able to perform and teach these skills around the U.S. I am involved with a non-profit organization called <a href=""http://www.soulciety.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Soulciety"">Soulciety</a> that will be travelling back to the Philippines in January 2014 to provide education and resources to schools that are heavily affected by poverty, abuse, and negelect. This program is called <a href=""http://soulciety.org/programs/the-bridge-overseas-mission"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Bridge""><strong>The Bridge</strong></a>.<br/><br/>Video of my Skills: <a href=""http://youtu.be/MYqgRb6FIlo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/MYqgRb6FIlo</a></p>
<h3>The Bridge Program</h3>
<p>     <strong>The Bridge </strong>is an overseas educational mission and cultural immersion program that gives youth and young adults from the Bay Area and other parts of the U.S. an opportunity to provide resources and education to impoverished youth in different parts of the world. The program focuses on providing services and aid to the youth in the Philippines as they are in dire need of support.<br/><br/>     <strong>Issues in the Philippines include</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Philippines is an international hotspot for human trafficking, ranking among the top five countries in the world where most human trafficking victims come from. An estimated 100,000 children are trafficked in the Philippines, most of which are forced to become sex slaves in China, Japan, Europe, the Middle East, and the U.S.</li>
<li>40% of the Philippines' population (27.6 million people) lives under the poverty line. 1.4 million are street children.</li>
<li>11% of children (2.2 million in 2001) are forced into labor.</li>
<li>6 million children are malnourished</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>    With this program, our goal is to reach 8000 youth throughout the provinces of the Philippines by providing support and supplies to further their education and improve their health.</p>
<p>     <strong>Other program objectives include</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing 100 computers in order to build a minimum of 3 Computer Learning centers at schools and develop a computer literacy curriculum that will be taught to teachers to help youth reach their educational goals and prepare them for the work force</li>
<li>Promote Performing Arts education through music, dance, and poetry</li>
<li>Providing another 1000 pairs of shoes and promote proper footwear awareness</li>
<li>Provide another 5000 hygiene supplies such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, floss, shampoo, and soap and promote proper hygiene awareness</li>

</h3>
<h3>What exactly does the money go to?</h3>
<p>     My main purpose for being involved is to help with the services and education that is being provided by the program. There will be about a total of 12-16 of us that will be travelling to the Philippines to educate and provide for the impoverish communities. Each individual is responsible for fundraising $3000 which will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flight: $1200</li>
<li>Lodging: $700</li>
<li>Transportation: $100</li>
<li>Food: $300</li>
<li>Daily Expenses: $400</li>
<li>Special Projects: $300</li>
</ul>
<p>     In case my $3000 goal is not reached, I will not be able to travel to the Philippines to take part in the 2014 Bridge Program, but all funds raised will go towards coordinating the program.</p>

<h3>Prayers on Wings - Who We Are</h3>
<p>Our organization is the vision of Devin Nakasone, a childhood leukemia survivor.  Having to deal with major emotional issues in his teens and young adulthood, he later realized that they could be traced to the feelings of guilt, shame, and fear that he had unknowingly bottled up while his parents were focused on his physical survival.  During that time his best friend became a rubber duck.  Today his mission is to build bridges of communication between children in crisis and their loved ones, utilizing a simple rubber duck, because with proper communication, survival is easier.<br/><br/>This campaign is to help our rapidly growing organization obtain office space and equipment that will enable us to reach a larger number of people more quickly and efficiently.  We have the vision, but lack adequate equipment.  We hope with updated technology, we will be able to expand our reach to whoever needs our help.<br/><br/></p>

While it has taken many years for it to reach this level it now has a building of its own, a traveling and performing brass band and is an education center for younger musicians. The center is partnered with the The Uganda Baltimore Alliance (TUBA) that connects musicians from Baltimore with those in Uganda, that's where I come in..Who I AmMy name is Liz Fryer. I am Peabody Conservatory graduate in French horn performance and music education. I love music, I love teaching, and I love working with the musicians in Uganda. However, being a student and wanting to make these passions a working reality means that I am going to need your help..Who You AreToday you are You, that is truer than true. There is no one alive who is Youer than You!A little Dr. Seuss is always good for the soul :). Moving on! You are the person that can make all of this possible. By donating not only are you helping to fund my travel expenses, but if we are able to reach higher then the $2,500 goal then you are also putting money towards music, theory books, new instruments, repairs to current instruments, band uniforms (which they will look just marvelous in) and growing the organization so that this center can thrive and support itself. Uganda is a country that is struggling with high unemployment especially in youths, and contributions go towards giving these youth a job and also the ability to do something wonderful and take pride in it.Now as I mentioned before this will be a return visit for me. A year and a half ago I went with two wonderful women, brass players, and close friends of mine and we had a fabulous life-changing experience that I cannot wait to have again!

story I would like to share with you. After I ran across Ireland I
was talking to a friend in London who had donated thirty pounds to
the cause. He said to me, ""Mally, anytime I think of the
progress that your little girl makes, I know I directly contributed
to that."" He is right, he made her life different, just
like you can do the same. We are asking for donations of all sizes before she starts her new
school on April 28th. Our aim is 2,000 euros. What you will receive
in return is changing a little girls life. This is not hyperbole, you
will change her life in every way imaginable. Her social, written,
reading, and life skills will benefit from her new program. Having
been at the new school yesterday with her mum I can tell you the new
system is comprehensive and run by the best people around. Please
consider this as not just a donation but an investment. Thank you for
your generousity. On behalf of Pearl and the McLoughlin family.
Sincerely,
Malcolm McLoughlin.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
The purpose of the organization is to support poor Guatemalan youth, i.e., for the most part, descendants of the ancient Maya, in the pursuit of an education to first-world standards in the United States. Job training is not the object. Neither is the immediate relief of poverty. Rather, the organization seeks to give its direct beneficiaries an opportunity to acquire the knowledge of history and world affairs, of politics and jurisprudence, of philosophy and economics, and of science, literature, and the arts to enable them to transform the conditions in which their forebears have traditionally lived. In short, the organization’s objective is the creation of a cadre of knowledgeable leaders, of thinkers and writers, of professionals and entrepreneurs, in sufficient numbers to effect significant socio-economic development in Guatemala.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>John Bodoh found the organization in 2003 after traveling and teaching in Guatemala. As a result of his experiences he was persuaded that the educational system of Guatemala is inadequate to the task of bringing the poor out of poverty and then conceived a plan for bringing some of them to the U.S. for part of their education. With no experience in non-profit organizations he struggled to find a way to bring his vision to reality. His heroic efforts paid off with the formation and growth of the Guatemalan Student Support Group.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>GSSG pays all major expenses for the Guatemalan students: passport, visa, airfare, major clothing, medical, dental, and eye care, tuition, books and school supplies.</p>
<p>The students live with host families who provide room and meals as well as a supportive atmosphere.</p>
<p>Donors provide all the financial resources for GSSG. Supporting a child in high school costs GSSG about $7,500 per year and in college the costs jump to about $30,000 per year.  You can become a part of this effort by helping toward the cost of one high school student. Any donation will be acknowledged with much gratitude.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We, at the GSSG, feel that the existence of a middle class is an essential element in the business environment of a modern democracy, the dearth of such a class in the socioeconomic structure of Guatemala is the chief cause of that country’s social, political, and economic dysfunction. Our program to develop Guatemala’s middle class through the education of a cadre of promising Guatemalan youth serves not only the citizenry of Guatemala but U.S. interests as well and is eminently replicable throughout Latin America.  </p>
<p>Our program has other benefits in addition to helping improve socioeconomic conditions in Guatemala. GSSG will help reduce the destructive effect of emigration to the USA on the Guatemalan society, and, through the development of personal, professional, and state friendships, diminish the likelihood of violence involving USA interests abroad.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you want to do more, you can also partially sponsor a Guatemalan student during his educational years in the USA. Sonsorships start as low as $25 per month. You will receive information about your child's background, school progress, and will have the opportunity to communicate with the student by mail if you wish.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute please tell your family and friends about the GSSG and its mission.</p>

<h3>Not Your Typical ""SEX ED""</h3>
<p>I am a sexologist (Ph.D. Candidate, Human Sexuality, M.Ed. Human Sexuality, B.A. Sexuality, Marriage, and Family) and I believe that 1. Sex should be fun 2. Pleasure is good for you 3. Everyone should be free to enjoy their sexuality without fear of violence.</p>
<p>I relay this message to college students via workshops that are empowering, sex-positive, pleasure-focused, and fun. Topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Female Orgasm</li>
<li>How to Feel Sexy Naked</li>
<li>Safer and Sexy</li>
<li>Sex: Am I Normal?</li>
<li>Ask the Sexologist</li>
<li>The Politics of Sexual Oppression</li>
<li>The 21 Year Old Entrepreneur</li>
<li>Being an LGBT Ally</li>
<li>and more!</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not uncommon for students in my workshops to move from laughter, to life-changing introspection, to happy tears, in a one hour presentation. Due to such a response, colleges ALWAYS invite me back, many inviting me back each semester (twice per year) to speak and present one of my workshops. However this year I'm finding that colleges and universities have had their budgets slashed, and many student clubs and organizations that normally use my services have a prohibitively low budget or no budget at all.</p>
<p>Your contribution will bring my sex-positive, holistic, and comprehensive sex education programs to college students who no longer have speaker budgets.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My workshops cost $1,000. If I reach my $3,000 goal that will mean that three colleges can have access to sex-positive education at no cost to them. Or, 4, 5, 6,  or more colleges with small budgets that can contribute part of the cost can have access to sex-positive education at a subsidized rate.</p>
As a thank you for your contribution, I'm offering some sexy perks for folks who contribute at the $5, $25, $50, $100, and $200 level.</div>

</ul>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have taught over 5,000 college students the importance of why sex should be fun, pleasure is good for you, and everyone should be able to enjoy their sexuality without fear of violence.</p>
<p>This is important work because today's college students completely missed out on sex education during their entire adolescence, as they were in middle and high school during the ""abstinence-only"" education mandate. Here are some quick stats from my college audiences in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 90% didn't know the difference between a vulva and a vagina before my Female Orgasm workshop. What does that say about the way we view female sexuality in our culture if no one know or cares what the thing is called?</li>
<li>Approximately 85% didn't know that you can get STIs like herpes and HPV from unprotected oral sex before my Safer and Sexy workshop.</li>
<li>Approximately 60% couldn't name a single thing they liked about themselves before my How to Feel Sexy Naked workshop. 98% could after my workshop.</li>
</ul><p>I don't want to focus on the pre-workshop detriments because that is never the focus of my presentations, which is probably why they work so well. I do these workshops to increase positives, not necessary decrease negatives. So for me, the impact is that a student has an empowered, shame-free understanding of their sexuality when they walk out and they are ready to pay it forward with compassion and sensitivity as they encounter other sexualities in the world.</p>

What would happen if a dozen middle schoolers who never used cameras got a summer to take pictures of their families and neighborhood? What if you used photography as a means to talk about leadership, what if a camera lens became a new way to see your neighborhood and understand your place within?</p>
<p>Then the idea met Chelsea and Brandon. They live and work in St. John’s, a neighborhood just north of downtown Austin. Chelsea worked with kids everyday, and knew just the ones who might embrace the experiment. So the  ideas got together, grabbed coffee, and this project was brewed.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The Goal</strong><br/>A six-week community development curriculum emerged. It had two parts.</p>
<p>1) To show middle schoolers their leadership potential, train them, and give them responsibility as counselors at a week long elementary summer camp.</p>
<p>2) To reinforce the students' understanding of themselves as change agents. Through teaching them basic photography we've shown them a new way to view their neighborhood and given them the chance to see themselves as leaders who can make a difference.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The Need</strong><br/>So now we need your help. We had the digital cameras donated. Pizza's been subsidized, but we want to throw a gala and show the students their hard work paid off. We're planning a gallery to display their shots and tell their stories. It will kick off a Fall series that continues to talk about the students and their neighborhood.</p>
<p>Austin Stone's generously offered us space on the wall of the St. John's campus to display a picture and short biography from each student. Getting these printed isn't cheap. Then we're hoping to give each student a photo book with the pictures they and their classmates shot this summer. We need your generosity to make that possible. Here's the breakdown.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Prints - $100 (10 pictures x $10 prints) </em></li>
<li><em>Frames - $100 (10 pictures x $10 frames) </em></li>

<li><em>Food &amp; Beverages - $25</em></li>
<li><em>IndieGoGo Fees and Reward Costs - $75 (Kickstarter 5%, CC 3%)</em></li>
</ul><p>If we raise more than $500 we'd love to spread the word about class to more folks in Austin. We've spoken with area coffee shops that are happy to display their work, but that will cost more money to print. If we cover that, we'd love to buy cameras for the students to own (<a href=""http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/852393-REG/Vivitar_V46_RED_4_1MP_V46_Digital_Camera.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">$40 with batteries and memory card</a>).</p>

The PBKS drop-in centre provides people with food and drink, medical advice, spiritual and religious guidance and a safe space to be in. 
To bring away your child from dangerous streets even if it is just for a day. To have a chance to sleep for a few hours on a bed instead of a collapsed cardboard box in a dark smelly alley. To bathe and wash clothes. To talk to another person without fear of violence or being robbed. Basically a chance for them to feel human again.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Discrimination has always been an overbearing issue in today’s
society. It has plagued the world since the beginning of time and still runs rampant
today. Many throughout history have tried and managed to lie down and defeat a
small bit of discrimination, yet no one has been able to combat it as a whole.
Yet, in Oakland, CA, one small organization plans to combat the age old ideas
of prejudice and culture discrimination with the new age youth coming into the
world. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span></span>The
Mosaic Project draws from all demographics of 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup>
graders to create a diverse group to show how diverse the whole really is.
Mosaic’s goal is to show these young people that they can combat discrimination
in the world as they grow and become leaders and members of society. They work
to break down social barriers to create a world that is void of hate based on
differences, whether it be gender, sexual orientation, religion, race, culture
or any other differences that exist today. They “have created a microcosm of

<p>
</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Freddie Lambright, III and I was born and raised in the Northern California Bay Area in Oakland and Berkeley. I graduated from the Oakland
School for the Arts Visual Arts Program in June, 2013.  I am a freshman at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC).<br/></p>
<p>I've been drawing
seriously since fourth grade and want to become a professional illustrator. 
I've watched my techniques improve over the years and I'm excited about my
talent and potential.  I believe that I have a special gift to offer the world.  My art positively contributes to social justice and helping people
discover their uniqueness through exposure to my artwork.  Your contributions will
help fund my college education at SAIC as
I major in Illustration and double minor in Business and Art History.</p>
<p>I invite you to contribute to my multi-phase project, a unique concept called ""The Royal Suite,"" which is a series of illustrations starting with the premier piece shown here, Queen of Clubs, or as I call them Clovers.  She rules
the human kingdom and is also the Queen Bee. </p>
<p>I haven't yet finalized whether the next few pieces will complete the other Queens in the suits of Hearts, Diamonds, and Spades OR if I'll complete the rest of the suit of  Clovers, i.e. King, Jack, and Ace OR another combination.  It depends on which way my creative juices are flowing.  Ultimately, you'll be able to collect favorite pieces in a series or in a suit.  Stay tuned as more beautiful,
impressive, and outstanding work from the project will be on the way over the course of the year.  And ... please tell a friend or two about my work so we can all spread the word.  It's an exciting and ambitious project.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Campaign Description and Why It's Important to Me.</b></li></ul>

My
campaign is to create a new body of art work over the course of my college career that people can track and collect
as I complete pieces in the series. This is Afro-Futuristic art, which intrigues me and allows for great creativity and artistic expression.  Hopefully you will be able to witness my growth and development as an artist as the pieces in the project evolve.  Contributors are supporting my growth and excellence in art as my techniques develop, expand, and become enhanced. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>This
campaign is important to me because it will help fund my college education and
my dreams of becoming a professional illustrator. This
campaign is essential for my continued attendance at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. </p>
<p>This
campaign is also important to me as I build a new portfolio of works and a
cohesive series of art pieces. This campaign will enable me to create a new college level portfolio, while simultaneously securing needed funding for college. </p>
<br/><ul><li><b>Please Help Me to Get Closer to My Dreams.</b></li></ul>

By funding
my project you will help a young, exceptionally talented, African-American man
attend the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and pursue his
dreams of becoming a professional illustrator. This project will help provide much needed funding for my tuition for spring semester.  My first semester at SAIC is going well and I really want to continue.<br/><br/>I’m going to college in a
beautiful city that is known for being a cultural and artistic hub, which will greatly influence and develop my art skills and talents. By supporting my Queen of Clovers Campaign, and others in the Royal Suite Project, you will also help me get
my name out in the world as an artist. I love for people to see and appreciate my art because I enjoy sharing
my creative vision with others. I want more people to see my talent and potential.  By funding my campaign, you will become a part of my community to help showcase my talent and skill, and help encourage and empower a young talented brother with competence and vision.  

Together we can make a positive difference in the world, which is so needed.<br/><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>Breaking it down for ya'll in more detail:</b></p>
<p>We actually need almost $13,000 to help fund my college education for the remainder of this school year, but we're targeting half of that to start in this campaign. It would be great to exceed our goal and put us closer to our actual target amount needed.</p>
<p>The total cost of my education this academic year is about $57,000. I've been blessed so far to have received multiple scholarships from the Bacon Family foundation, the East Bay College Fund, Oakland Center for Spiritual Living, and School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  We're in application for a Marcus Foster Brotherhood scholarship, as well as one relating to Afro Futuristic art which fits perfectly with my artistic interests as I mentioned earlier.  We'll also be applying soon for more scholarship for the next academic year.  We need all the help we can get, including your thoughtful and generous support.<br/></p>
<p>My family hosted my first solo artist showcase on August 17, 2013 before leaving for college as a fundraiser event, where I displayed 14 pieces, some of which were already sold and others I sold at the event.  The event went very well.  We took the opportunity at the art show to highlight this online fundraising campaign and unveiled the original Queen of Clovers, which was very well received.</p>
<p>I am so grateful for all donations - small, medium and large - as the money
you contribute to this project will further fund my educational expenses this year.  I hope to launch at least one art campaign per semester that I'm at SAIC to continue this important fundraising activity for my continuation in college, as well as to continue to gain exposure and grow my reputation as a successful visual artist. This will also incent me to complete the Royal Suite Project, which is an exciting original concept that I'm very proud of.  By contributing to my campaign, you will be on the cutting edge of my budding art career.  Just think, you will be able to say ""I knew him when and I supported him from the very start of his college career!  Look at him now!""<br/></p>
<p><b> - Perks!!</b><br/></p>
<p>For this campaign, contributors
get perks based on the featured piece - Queen of Clovers - and the level of contribution.  Subsequent campaigns will work similarly.   I will later publish the timeline of when I will be
finishing individual
pieces and suits in the larger scheme of the project.  Queen of Clovers is finished; I will finish other pieces for next campaigns as soon I can realistically during my school schedule.  The perks will be distributed within a reasonable time frame of the campaign.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul><li><b>Describe where the funds go if you don’t reach your
     entire goal.</b></li></ul>

I have total faith in the Universe that I will reach my entire goal with the help and generous financial support of people like you.  All funds, regardless of if more or less than the ultimate goal,
will go towards funding my college education at SAIC. 

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<ul><li><b> Why is my project valuable to the contributor
     and to the world.</b></li></ul>

Funding
my campaign will get my name out into the world as an artist, show people my
talent and skill, and help fund a young talented brother with artistic skill and creative
vision. <p></p>
<br/><p>PLEASE
SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN AND MY ART!! THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR WONDERFUL CONTRIBUTIONS. NO MATTER HOW SMALL OR LARGE, IT ALL MAKES A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN HELPING ME ATTEND THE SCHOOL OF THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO!  GOD BLESS YOU, TRULY.<br/></p>

I've been blessed so far to have received multiple scholarships from the Bacon Family foundation, the East Bay College Fund, Oakland Center for Spiritual Living, and School of the Art Institute of Chicago.  We're in application for a Marcus Foster Brotherhood scholarship, as well as one relating to Afro Futuristic art which fits perfectly with my artistic interests as I mentioned earlier.  We'll also be applying soon for more scholarship for the next academic year.  We need all the help we can get, including your thoughtful and generous support.
My family hosted my first solo artist showcase on August 17, 2013 before leaving for college as a fundraiser event, where I displayed 14 pieces, some of which were already sold and others I sold at the event.  The event went very well.  We took the opportunity at the art show to highlight this online fundraising campaign and unveiled the original Queen of Clovers, which was very well received.
I am so grateful for all donations - small, medium and large - as the money
you contribute to this project will further fund my educational expenses this year.  I hope to launch at least one art campaign per semester that I'm at SAIC to continue this important fundraising activity for my continuation in college, as well as to continue to gain exposure and grow my reputation as a successful visual artist. This will also incent me to complete the Royal Suite Project, which is an exciting original concept that I'm very proud of.  By contributing to my campaign, you will be on the cutting edge of my budding art career.  Just think, you will be able to say ""I knew him when and I supported him from the very start of his college career!  Look at him now!""
 - Perks!!
For this campaign, contributors
get perks based on the featured piece - Queen of Clovers - and the level of contribution.  Subsequent campaigns will work similarly.   I will later publish the timeline of when I will be
finishing individual
pieces and suits in the larger scheme of the project.  Queen of Clovers is finished; I will finish other pieces for next campaigns as soon I can realistically during my school schedule.  The perks will be distributed within a reasonable time frame of the campaign.



Describe where the funds go if you don’t reach your
     entire goal.

I have total faith in the Universe that I will reach my entire goal with the help and generous financial support of people like you.  All funds, regardless of if more or less than the ultimate goal,
will go towards funding my college education at SAIC. 






 Why is my project valuable to the contributor
     and to the world.

Funding
my campaign will get my name out into the world as an artist, show people my
talent and skill, and help fund a young talented brother with artistic skill and creative
vision. 
PLEASE
SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT MY CAMPAIGN AND MY ART!! THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR WONDERFUL CONTRIBUTIONS. NO MATTER HOW SMALL OR LARGE, IT ALL MAKES A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN HELPING ME ATTEND THE SCHOOL OF THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO!  GOD BLESS YOU, TRULY.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Dear Friends and Colleagues,</p>

We'd like to keep up with the costs and with our commitment to our membership. To do so, we'd like to provide a stipend for someone to assist with the work of the journal, as well as pay for our continuing overhead including the web work.</p>

<p><strong>More on Sephardic Horizons:</strong></p>
<p>Much interesting new research and writing is being conducted in the broader field of Sephardic studies as well as its core, and professional scholars are joined by enthusiastic lay scholars interested in preserving and disseminating the knowledge of their own communities. Sephardic Horizons wishes to throw a spotlight on valuable new writing wherever it is being produced.</p>
<p>We are especially committed to publishing new writing and interesting features in Ladino/Judeo-Spanish. Although this journal concentrates on the ‘core’ Sephardic culture, that of the Jews who were exiled from the Iberian Peninsula, it includes not only the core culture but also that of Jews who consider themselves Sephardim in the wider sense. In this definition, the Jewish communities of the former Ottoman Empire and the broader Mediterranean and Middle East, even those who do not trace their origin to Iberia, have commonalities deriving from the centuries when Babylon was the preeminent Jewish center which, as it faded, passed the baton to the Mediterranean communities, above all to al-Andalus. Since the expulsion from Spain in 1492, many Sephardim returned to these same regions, as well as emigrating to Europe and the Americas.</p>
<p>Sephardic Horizons has grown out of the Vijitas de Alhad of Washington, an informal group that meets in the Washington DC area to celebrate Sephardic culture, Sephardic music and the Ladino or Judeo-Spanish language.

The group was founded by Flory Jagoda and developed by Ralph Tarica, Albert Garih, Rosine Nussenblatt, Bension Varon, Leon Taranto, and others beginning around the year 2000.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<div>Hey guys!<br/><br/>
</div>
My name is Amanda. I'm 21 years old and a native of Brooklyn, NY, aka, the land of super expensive living. I'm a college student, attending St. Joseph's Brooklyn Campus for Speech Communications and Theatre. You might know me from around the interwebs, I've RPed Black Canary on Tumblr for a Young Justice RP, and I'm known as <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/undiesofwondy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@UndiesofWondy</a></strong> on Twitter and <a href=""http://undiesofwondy.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Tumblr</a>. Like most college students, guess what? I'm broke. Like, really, really, <em>really</em> broke. <br/><br/>
</div>
However, I'm totally prepared to make a fool out of myself on the internet in order to fund something super awesome mega foxy hot!<br/><br/>
</div>
I'm trying to raise money to attend <strong><a href=""http://www.CONvergence-con.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CONvergence</a></strong>, a convention out in MN. I've toyed with the idea of possibly moving out there, although it'd be awesome just to see someplace new. I have a chance to be on some fan panels that I signed up for, and to be honest, I'd really just love to meet some super cool people who are into the same things that I am. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here's where you guys come in! I've already saved some money, found crash space, all that good stuff. But attending CONvergence, at the cheapest, will cost me around 350 for airfare and hotel. (Indiegogo's minimum fundraising level is $500, but I only need $350!)</div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div>Literally, every little bit will help me out. And if I do go to CONvergence, I will legitimately cosplay <a href=""http://blog.christopherjonesart.com/about-chris/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">comic book artist Christopher Jones</a>. Seriously. Can you honestly say you don't want to see that? And maybe even cosplay something else that I'll let everyone vote on. <br/><br/>

<h2><strong><em>Sending Children to School</em></strong></h2>
<p>Your campaign donation will directly contribute to the school fees and related costs of <strong>sending the children of OrphanAid Africa (OA) to school.</strong></p>
<p>In Ghana, illiteracy and lack of career training are two main challenges that make the escape from poverty so difficult. This is especially true for Ghanaians living in rural communities, and even more so for women and children. Education and training are the two essential foundations for building a future with greater opportunities, and for this reason it is an area in which we focus our strongest efforts.</p>
<p>Despite free basic education in Ghana, <strong>the costs related to sending a child to school (books, uniforms &amp; shoes, transportation, PTA dues, etc.) oftentimes make it impossible for families to send their children to school.</strong> While understanding the importance of schooling, some parents feel forced to place their children in an orphanage since they believe this may be the only chance they have to receive a quality education.</p>
<p><strong>OrphanAid Africa supports</strong> <strong>these families by providing for school fees and related costs, or supplementing these costs based on a family’s financial circumstances.</strong> Specially assigned OrphanAid Africa staff members closely monitor the progress of the children to ensure that they are regularly attending classes, have access to the resources they need and are doing their best to be successful.<br/><br/> In July of 2006, OA constructed and equipped a new primary school in the poor village of Ayenyah, a community that had never before had a local school. <strong>This school provides basic education to children that are supported through the OA foster family program, as well as the children of Ayenyah and its surrounding communities.</strong> Since its opening, there has been a significant improvement in the education level of the school's students, especially in the subject areas of English, mathematics, reading and writing. The school is also one of the first in the country to have integrated classrooms for children with mental disabilities. <strong>Currently, this school serves more than 561 students and adults.</strong></p>
<p>In line with the mission to provide vulnerable children with opportunities to grow up in a positive environment, OrphanAid Africa has started an extensive sports program which serves children from vulnerable families. Through this program, children have opportunities to participate in sports and recreation, thereby encouraging greater self-esteem, better health and positive relationships with other children as well as adult mentors and role models.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Since 1972, the Red Balloon Day Care Center has been a strong philanthropic institute in the Harlem/Washington Heights community.  For almost two decades we have been able to distribute $85,000/year in scholarships to working families and full-time parent students.  About one-third of our working families receive assistance.  In 2012, our city government funding (ACS) was  completely eliminated as a consequence of nationwide budget cuts.  Moreover, our two largest fundraising events, previously hosted at rent-free venues were terminated due to changes in those venues’ policies. </p>
<p> What makes these cuts particularly devastating is that they came very late in the enrollment/admissions process <strong>after</strong> we had already committed to giving scholarships. We decided to honor the scholarships offered to those families. For many of our families the loss of their scholarship would mean losing their jobs and other sources of income to stay home with their children.  This has left us with a deficit of $60,000. We are seeking a short- term infusion of money to make up for this loss and get back to a balanced budget in the next year.  <strong>We are even facing the possibility of having to close down our school if we do not get this much needed help.</strong>  We are optimistic that this eventuality can be avoided with your outside contributions.</p>
<p>We are exploring every avenue possible.  We are already beginning to formulate new marketing ideas and financial strategies for the future to allow us to continue assisting needy families and supporting the fabric of our neighborhood and local community. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money raised during this campaign will help us subsidize $60,000 towards the cost of our scholarship benefits for the 15 students currently receiving financial aid. </p>
<p>We are a 501c3 so all donations are tax deductible.  Visit our site at <a href=""http://www.redballoonlearningcenter.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.redballoonlearningcenter.org</a> and learn more about us.</p>

<h3><strong> The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>While there are many “childcare” facilities in New York City, very few have the unique personal and physical resources that Red Balloon has and which your contribution could help preserve.  Some of these include:</p>
<ul><ul>
<li>
<p>Commitment to Food Justice: The Red Balloon is aware of issues of food inequality in urban areas and the lack of food quality that permeates some neighborhoods we serve.  Because of that the Red Balloon provides the children with a nutritious breakfast, a fresh homemade lunch, and healthy snacks.  Furthermore the children learn early on to tend to their community garden and understand the value of urban sustainability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valuing Social Diversity: While New York City is noted for its social diversity, when it comes to educational settings this global metropolis experiences significant levels of segregation, particularly across class and racial lines.  By drawing families and caregivers from a range of socio-economic backgrounds we reaffirm our commitment to respecting and valuing diversity in terms of class, race, sexual orientation, nationality, language, and household composition.  This commitment to diversity is sustained in part by our scholarship program.</p>
</li>
<li>Preparation For Kindergarten Entrance:  Over the last twenty years we have helped more than 300 children to gain entrance to the top public and private schools in NYC and to Gifted &amp;Talented programs and, eventually, to top colleges and universities.  For many of these children, this would not have happened without the Red Balloon. </li>
<li>
<p>Superb Space and Facilities:  The Red Balloon is housed in an expansive  facility with bright spacious classrooms, a large indoor gym, an outdoor playdeck, a built-in wading pool, a large lending library, and an outdoor planter garden.  Growing up in an urban area places  constraints on children's ability to have safe play areas to develop their motor skills.  We take optimal advantage of our great facility by daily engaging the children in developmentally appropriate physical challenges, instilling in them the value of physical activity and healthy living habits.</p>
</li>
</ul></ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why do we merit the financial support we are requesting?</strong></h3>
<p>The heart and soul of the Red Balloon is our commitment to financially helping low income families by providing them a high quality educational head start as we strive to be a model of exemplary early childhood practices.  We partner with our families to create a safe and nurturing environment where children are guided to reach their full potential, while planting the seeds for a love of learning and a lifetime of social commitment.  These goals serve as an impetus for our fundraising endeavors.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we believe that the current economic situation has tipped the balance toward the haves and abandoned the have-nots.  For 40 years our school has fought to maintain a parity of families from all backgrounds but the resources that we depended upon have all but disappeared.  We need the help of your private donations to stem the tide. </p>

</h3><p>My name is Brent Shultz and I am writing to request scholarship funding to attend the California State University Summer Arts 2014 Program. The course I am interested in attending this summer is Drama 621, Stage Combat: Unarmed and Small Weapons SPT Intensive; a two week intensive course focusing on the skills and techniques needed to create the illusion of violence on stage through the use of weapons and fight choreography. Coordinated by Dr. Terry Smith, this course will culminate in a Skills Proficiency Test by a Society of American Fight Directors Fight Master.</p>
<p>  Currently, I am in my final year at The New School for Drama in New York City, working towards a Master of Fine Arts Degree in Acting. As part of the second year curriculum the students study Stage Combat under Broadway Fight Director, Tom Schall; with whom I also worked as Fight Captain for our production of Shakespeare's <i>MacBeth </i>last Spring. While the class covers a wide range of stage combat techniques and skills needed by actors working in most basic theatrical productions, it does not grant any  accreditation towards our development as working professional artists. </p>
<p>  Last year I was able to participate in CSU Summer Arts Rapier and Dagger workshop and received my certification through SAFD. Actors who have professionally certified fight training are more marketable and find work in theater and film both as performers and as fight choreographers. Since gaining my first accreditation I have worked as fight captain for my director's thesis in the fall, as well as staging fights for the 2<sup>nd</sup> year directors' classic adaptations at my school. Also, I have had the privilege to be Tom Schall's assistant for the stage combat course taught at The New School this year: the first time a student has had the opportunity in our program.

<h3>The Team of Weird, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K-xgBpQU84"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Quidditch</a>-Playing Belgians!</h3></span></h3></span></h3><p><span>Yup, we are the national Belgian <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle_Quidditch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">quidditch</a> team, unofficially dubbed the Gryffins, composed of Belgian quidkids dying to get over to Vancouver, B.C., Canada to play in the Global Games hosted by the <a href=""http://iqaquidditch.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">International Quidditch Association</a>!</span></p><p><span>What is the Global Games? Well, go <a href=""http://iqaquidditch.com/events/special/global-games"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">check out the official page</a> by the IQA! In brief, it is a tournament of all the national teams that can front quidditch teams held every two years.</span></p><p>This year will be Belgium’s debut at the second Global Games where the first was held as the “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hm_mEhFdbfE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Summer Games</a>” in Oxford, UK before the Olympics. In fact, this is the first year Belgian has supported a quidditch team in any capacity, so we are trying to really prove to the world what we are made of in the land of frites and chocolate. The team will primarily be made up of players from the two official teams of the past season: the Qwaffles and the Dodos, teams that are third and sixth in Europe, respectively… nothing to scoff at!</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FNRZHjIjYPIc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNRZHjIjYPIc&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FNRZHjIjYPIc%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><i>(Unfortunately there was not footage of the Qwaffles nor the Dodos at the championships)</i><p></p><p>The money raised here will be used to help reduce the cost of the players’ plane tickets across not only the Atlantic but the great country of Canada if not pay in full! Luckily, their coach calls Vancouver home, so accommodation is not too much of an issue, but the plane tickets are currently looking like quite a barrier to cross, unfortunately, especially as many of us are broke, young students or workers.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3><span>Our Goal and Why So Much?</span></h3><p></p><p><span>Unfortunately, 8000km is no easy trek, and airlines know this! Tickets and expected costs (team transport and team meal options) are looking to be about €1,000 with round-trip tickets from Brussels to YVR. Our goal of €8,500 would get a team of 10 players over to Vancity with minor amounts of additional costs. That would allow the team of 10 to get over to Van with enough time in advance to shake off the effects of jetlag and understand the city before actually competing all the while socializing and interacting with early arrivers and then get the 9 remaining Belgians (David, the coach, is staying to finish his studies at UBC) back home safe, sound and hopefully champions!</span></p><p>Teams consist of minimum 7 and maximum 21 players. Our base goal is to get a team of 10 over there, offering basic field play and some substitutes, but it is not optimal. We, however, are aiming, through additional funding schemes as well, to get more than 10 players there, but this would ensure Belgium is well represented at IQA’s biggest, most international event ever.</p><p>The funding time ends on 15 May to ensure adequate time to purchase tickets as well as give our supporters enough time to donate! If you wish to donate more after this date, Belgium Muggle Quidditch, the parent organization of all Belgian quidditch teams, always welcomes donations!</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b>Perks!</b></h3><p></p><p>As you can see, we have a super wide variety of perks! Because we have fans and supporters on at least two different continents in dozens of countries, we had to separate some perks by an individual’s location, as posting things from Belgium might get expensive. Moreover, certain perks might be hand-delivered, some might be posted from Canada from the coach’s house or from Belgium itself. Because our perks are subject to, well, borders, there are some constraints we will be dealing with, namely beer and maple syrup, that is why there are limited numbers. Otherwise, we are excited to offer our supports some top-notch deals, be it some of the most amazing beer, some motherflippin’, pure maple syrup (tested and proven to be perfect; a staple of the coach’s flat in Brussels) or even adopting quidkids!</p><p></p><p></p><h3><span>Really, what this means for us...</span></h3><p></p><p><span>We have not played quidditch for too long here in our bizarre, little country, it is true. This tournament is not only a way to show the world that we mean business, but it is a way to pump up Belgium, really kickstart teams in not only our country, but the Benelux and surrounding countries!</span></p><p>The quidditch community is a fantastic group of people from all walks of life. Your contribution helps to promote not just Team Belgium, but gender equality, general sportsmanship and international cooperation!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p></p><p><span>Already funded us?

</h3><p></p><p></p><p><span>Hey, nous sommes l’équipe nationale de Belgique du <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muggle_Quidditch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">quidditch</a>, officieusement surnommée les Griffons, composée de quidkids déterminés à se rendre à Vancouver, B.C., au Canada, pour participer aux Jeux Mondiaux organisés par l’<a href=""iqaquidditch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Association Internationale de Quidditch</a>!</span></p><p>Que sont les Jeux Mondiaux? En bref, c’est un tournoi organisé tous les deux ans, réunissant les équipes nationales de tous les pays où le quidditch se joue!</p><p>Cette année, la Belgique sera présente pour la première fois aux Jeux Mondiaux, dont la première édition s’est tenue à Oxford, au Royaume-Uni, sous le nom de “Summer Games“. En fait, c’est carrément la première année du quidditch en Belgique, et nous avons vraiment envie de prouver au monde de quoi nous sommes capables dans le pays des frites et du chocolat! L’équipe sera constituée principalement de joueurs des deux équipes officielles de la saison : les Qwaffles et les Dodos, respectivement 3ème et 6ème dans le classement européen!</p>L’argent récolté ici sera utilisé pour réduire (si pas couvrir entièrement) les frais de déplacement des joueurs, pas seulement d’un côté à l’autre de l’océan Atlantique, mais aussi du Canada! Heureusement, notre coach peut nous héberger sans problème puisqu’il va justement s’installer à Vancouver, mais les billets d’avion sont vraiment un obstacle pour nous, particulièrement parce que nous sommes constitués d’une majorité d’étudiants fauchés ou de jeunes travailleurs.<br/><p></p><p></p><h3><span>Notre but, et pourquoi autant?</span></h3><p></p><p><span>Malheureusement, un voyage de 8000km n’est pas donné! Les billets d’avion et les frais prévus (transport et repas de l’équipe sur place) avoisinent les 1000€ par personne. Notre but de 8500€ permettrait d’envoyer une équipe de 10 joueurs à Vancouver avec un minimum de frais additionnels, suffisamment tôt avant la compétition pour que tout le monde puisse se remettre du long voyage et faire connaissance avec les autres joueurs tout en découvrant la ville, et bien sûr les ramener chez eux sains et saufs et, espérons-le, champions!</span></p><p>Les équipes sont constituées de minimum 7 joueurs et maximum 21. Notre but minimum est d’avoir 10 joueurs, ce qui nous laisserait 3 remplaçants, mais ce n’est pas optimal. Nous espérons donc pouvoir former une équipe plus grande, grâce notamment aux fonds que nous récolterons par d’autres moyens, pour représenter la Belgique en nombre à l’événement le plus grand et le plus international organisé par l’IQA!</p><p>La récolte d’argent prendra fin le 15 mai pour nous permettre d’acheter nos billets d’avion à temps ainsi que pour laisser assez de temps à nos donateurs ! Si vous souhaitez continuer à nous aider financièrement après cette date, sachez que Belgium Muggle Quidditch, l’organisation parente de toutes les équipes de Quidditch belges, accueille volontiers les dons!</p><p></p><h3>

We zijn de nationale Belgische <a href=""https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwerkbal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">zwerkbal</a> ploeg, onofficieel genaamd “the Gryffins”, samengesteld uit Belgische ‘quidkids’ die een moord zouden plegen om naar Vancouver, B.C., Canada te geraken om daar te kunnen spelen op de ‘Global Games’ georganiseerd door de ‘<a href=""http://iqaquidditch.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">International Quidditch Association</a>’!</span></p>Wat is ‘Global Games’? Wel… <a href=""iqaquidditch.com/events/special/global-games"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bekijk deze link</a>! Kort samengevat is het een toernooi waar alle nationale ploegen, dat quidditch ploegen hebben, tegen elkaar spelen. Dit wordt georganiseerd om de 2 jaar.<p></p><p>Dit jaar zou het België’s debuutjaar zijn op de 2de Global Games, dat eerder gehouden werd in Oxford, Verenigd Koninkrijk onder de naam “Summer Games” juist voor de Olympische Spelen. In feite is dit het eerste jaar dat België de kans krijgt om een team te sturen, dus willen we ons echt bewijzen en de wereld laten zien waartoe we in staat zijn! Het nationaal team zal bestaan uit spelers van de 2 officiële teams van het afgelopen seizoen: de ‘Qwaffles’ en de ‘Dodos’. Deze teams horen bij de top van Europa, met hun respectievelijke 3de en 6 plaats in Europa, wat niet niets is.<br/><br/> Al het geld dat hier verzameld wordt zal ons helpen om zoveel mogelijk van onze kosten voor de vliegtickets naar beneden te halen of zelfs sommige tickets volledig te betalen. Gelukkig is de coach van het nationale team wonende in Vancouver waardoor accommodatie ter plekke geen probleem is. De vliegtickets blijven zeer duur, wat voor veel van onze spelers niet te betalen valt, voornamelijk omdat vele van ons amper geld hebben, studenten of werknemers zijn.<br/></p><p></p><h3><span>Ons doel en waarom zo veel?</span></h3><p></p><p><span>Spijtig genoeg is 8000 km geen makkelijke weg om te overbruggen én luchtmaatschappijen weten dit ook! Tickets en voorziene kosten (zoals vervoer en maaltijden) lijken rond de €1000 te liggen per speler. Ons doel van €8500 zou een team van 10 spelers naar Vancouver kunnen krijgen. Dit zou het team genoeg tijd geven voor het evenement begint om door de jetlag te geraken, voordat ze aan de competitie moeten starten.</span></p><p>Ploegen bestaan uit minstens 7 en maximum 21 spelers. Dit doel is gesteld om een ploeg van 10 personen, om te “deftig” te kunnen spelen met enkele wisselspelers, maar het is zeker niet optimaal. We proberen, door andere projecten, meer spelers naar Vancouver te krijgen maar de weg is lang. Dit alles zou wel België een plaats garanderen op het grootste, meest internationale evenement van de IQA.</p>Deze campagne loopt tot 15 mei 2014, zodat we genoeg tijd hebben om effectief onze vliegtickets te kopen, maar ook genoeg tijd geven aan onze supporters om te doneren!

The Team of Weird, Quidditch-Playing Belgians!Yup, we are the national Belgian quidditch team, unofficially dubbed the Gryffins, composed of Belgian quidkids dying to get over to Vancouver, B.C., Canada to play in the Global Games hosted by the International Quidditch Association!What is the Global Games? Well, go check out the official page by the IQA! In brief, it is a tournament of all the national teams that can front quidditch teams held every two years.This year will be Belgium’s debut at the second Global Games where the first was held as the “Summer Games” in Oxford, UK before the Olympics. In fact, this is the first year Belgian has supported a quidditch team in any capacity, so we are trying to really prove to the world what we are made of in the land of frites and chocolate. The team will primarily be made up of players from the two official teams of the past season: the Qwaffles and the Dodos, teams that are third and sixth in Europe, respectively… nothing to scoff at!(Unfortunately there was not footage of the Qwaffles nor the Dodos at the championships)The money raised here will be used to help reduce the cost of the players’ plane tickets across not only the Atlantic but the great country of Canada if not pay in full! Luckily, their coach calls Vancouver home, so accommodation is not too much of an issue, but the plane tickets are currently looking like quite a barrier to cross, unfortunately, especially as many of us are broke, young students or workers.Our Goal and Why So Much?Unfortunately, 8000km is no easy trek, and airlines know this! Tickets and expected costs (team transport and team meal options) are looking to be about €1,000 with round-trip tickets from Brussels to YVR. Our goal of €8,500 would get a team of 10 players over to Vancity with minor amounts of additional costs. That would allow the team of 10 to get over to Van with enough time in advance to shake off the effects of jetlag and understand the city before actually competing all the while socializing and interacting with early arrivers and then get the 9 remaining Belgians (David, the coach, is staying to finish his studies at UBC) back home safe, sound and hopefully champions!Teams consist of minimum 7 and maximum 21 players. Our base goal is to get a team of 10 over there, offering basic field play and some substitutes, but it is not optimal. We, however, are aiming, through additional funding schemes as well, to get more than 10 players there, but this would ensure Belgium is well represented at IQA’s biggest, most international event ever.The funding time ends on 15 May to ensure adequate time to purchase tickets as well as give our supporters enough time to donate! If you wish to donate more after this date, Belgium Muggle Quidditch, the parent organization of all Belgian quidditch teams, always welcomes donations!Perks!As you can see, we have a super wide variety of perks! Because we have fans and supporters on at least two different continents in dozens of countries, we had to separate some perks by an individual’s location, as posting things from Belgium might get expensive. Moreover, certain perks might be hand-delivered, some might be posted from Canada from the coach’s house or from Belgium itself. Because our perks are subject to, well, borders, there are some constraints we will be dealing with, namely beer and maple syrup, that is why there are limited numbers. Otherwise, we are excited to offer our supports some top-notch deals, be it some of the most amazing beer, some motherflippin’, pure maple syrup (tested and proven to be perfect; a staple of the coach’s flat in Brussels) or even adopting quidkids!Really, what this means for us...We have not played quidditch for too long here in our bizarre, little country, it is true. This tournament is not only a way to show the world that we mean business, but it is a way to pump up Belgium, really kickstart teams in not only our country, but the Benelux and surrounding countries!The quidditch community is a fantastic group of people from all walks of life. Your contribution helps to promote not just Team Belgium, but gender equality, general sportsmanship and international cooperation!Other Ways You Can HelpAlready funded us?

C'est quoi cette folle équipe des joueurs de quidditch belges?
Hey, nous sommes l’équipe nationale de Belgique du quidditch, officieusement surnommée les Griffons, composée de quidkids déterminés à se rendre à Vancouver, B.C., au Canada, pour participer aux Jeux Mondiaux organisés par l’Association Internationale de Quidditch!Que sont les Jeux Mondiaux? En bref, c’est un tournoi organisé tous les deux ans, réunissant les équipes nationales de tous les pays où le quidditch se joue!Cette année, la Belgique sera présente pour la première fois aux Jeux Mondiaux, dont la première édition s’est tenue à Oxford, au Royaume-Uni, sous le nom de “Summer Games“. En fait, c’est carrément la première année du quidditch en Belgique, et nous avons vraiment envie de prouver au monde de quoi nous sommes capables dans le pays des frites et du chocolat! L’équipe sera constituée principalement de joueurs des deux équipes officielles de la saison : les Qwaffles et les Dodos, respectivement 3ème et 6ème dans le classement européen!L’argent récolté ici sera utilisé pour réduire (si pas couvrir entièrement) les frais de déplacement des joueurs, pas seulement d’un côté à l’autre de l’océan Atlantique, mais aussi du Canada! Heureusement, notre coach peut nous héberger sans problème puisqu’il va justement s’installer à Vancouver, mais les billets d’avion sont vraiment un obstacle pour nous, particulièrement parce que nous sommes constitués d’une majorité d’étudiants fauchés ou de jeunes travailleurs.Notre but, et pourquoi autant?Malheureusement, un voyage de 8000km n’est pas donné! Les billets d’avion et les frais prévus (transport et repas de l’équipe sur place) avoisinent les 1000€ par personne. Notre but de 8500€ permettrait d’envoyer une équipe de 10 joueurs à Vancouver avec un minimum de frais additionnels, suffisamment tôt avant la compétition pour que tout le monde puisse se remettre du long voyage et faire connaissance avec les autres joueurs tout en découvrant la ville, et bien sûr les ramener chez eux sains et saufs et, espérons-le, champions!Les équipes sont constituées de minimum 7 joueurs et maximum 21. Notre but minimum est d’avoir 10 joueurs, ce qui nous laisserait 3 remplaçants, mais ce n’est pas optimal. Nous espérons donc pouvoir former une équipe plus grande, grâce notamment aux fonds que nous récolterons par d’autres moyens, pour représenter la Belgique en nombre à l’événement le plus grand et le plus international organisé par l’IQA!La récolte d’argent prendra fin le 15 mai pour nous permettre d’acheter nos billets d’avion à temps ainsi que pour laisser assez de temps à nos donateurs ! Si vous souhaitez continuer à nous aider financièrement après cette date, sachez que Belgium Muggle Quidditch, l’organisation parente de toutes les équipes de Quidditch belges, accueille volontiers les dons!
Récompenses!
Pour les récompenses (perks) en français, cliquez ici.Comme vous pouvez le voir, nous proposons une grande variété de récompenses! Comme nous avons des fans et supporters dans au moins deux continents et des douzaines de pays, nous avons dû séparer les récompenses par région, les frais de port depuis la Belgique n’étant pas négligeables. Cependant, certaines récompenses pourront être livrées en mains propres, d’autres envoyées depuis le Canada, ou la Belgique. Dans ces deux derniers cas, nous serons limités par les douanes, notamment en ce qui concerne la bière ou le sirop d’érable, ce qui explique pourquoi leurs quantités sont limitées. A part ça, nous sommes impatients de pouvoir vous présenter des occasions uniques en leur genre en vous envoyant certaines de nos meilleures bières ou du sirop d’érable pur venant tout droit du Canada (testé et définitivement parfait, selon plusieurs membres de l’équipe), ou même en adoptant un joueur!Ce que ça représente pour nous…Il est vrai que le Quidditch est très récent dans notre petit pays bizarre. Ce tournoi n’est donc pas seulement notre chance de prouver au monde notre volonté et notre sérieux, mais aussi de donner envie à de nombreuses autres équipes belges, du Benelux et des pays alentours, de se développer en leur montrant jusqu’où elles pourraient arriver!Aide supplémentaireVous avez déjà contribué à notre projet? Ou vous n’avez pas les moyens de nous aider financièrement? Vous pouvez nous soutenir gratuitement, en nous suivant sur Facebook et Twitter!La communauté quidditch se compose d'un fantastique melting pot de personnes. Votre contribution nous aiderait non seulement à promouvoir l'équipe belge, mais également l'égalité entre les genres, l'esprit sportif et la coopération internationale!Belgium Muggle Quidditch sur Facebook@belgiumquidBrussels QwafflesDeurne DodosThank you! Merci! Dank u! Danke schön!– NL –De campagne is voorbij, we danken jullie voor de steun!Je kan nog altijd doneren: bekijk onze Facebookpagina voor meer informatie die binnekort zal binnenkomen!Als je geïnteresseerd bent in het kopen van sen truitje, vul dit bestelformulier in!Wat is deze gekke team van Belgische Zwerkbalspelers?Jazeker! We zijn de nationale Belgische zwerkbal ploeg, onofficieel genaamd “the Gryffins”, samengesteld uit Belgische ‘quidkids’ die een moord zouden plegen om naar Vancouver, B.C., Canada te geraken om daar te kunnen spelen op de ‘Global Games’ georganiseerd door de ‘International Quidditch Association’!Wat is ‘Global Games’? Wel… bekijk deze link! Kort samengevat is het een toernooi waar alle nationale ploegen, dat quidditch ploegen hebben, tegen elkaar spelen. Dit wordt georganiseerd om de 2 jaar.Dit jaar zou het België’s debuutjaar zijn op de 2de Global Games, dat eerder gehouden werd in Oxford, Verenigd Koninkrijk onder de naam “Summer Games” juist voor de Olympische Spelen. In feite is dit het eerste jaar dat België de kans krijgt om een team te sturen, dus willen we ons echt bewijzen en de wereld laten zien waartoe we in staat zijn! Het nationaal team zal bestaan uit spelers van de 2 officiële teams van het afgelopen seizoen: de ‘Qwaffles’ en de ‘Dodos’. Deze teams horen bij de top van Europa, met hun respectievelijke 3de en 6 plaats in Europa, wat niet niets is. Al het geld dat hier verzameld wordt zal ons helpen om zoveel mogelijk van onze kosten voor de vliegtickets naar beneden te halen of zelfs sommige tickets volledig te betalen. Gelukkig is de coach van het nationale team wonende in Vancouver waardoor accommodatie ter plekke geen probleem is. De vliegtickets blijven zeer duur, wat voor veel van onze spelers niet te betalen valt, voornamelijk omdat vele van ons amper geld hebben, studenten of werknemers zijn.Ons doel en waarom zo veel?Spijtig genoeg is 8000 km geen makkelijke weg om te overbruggen én luchtmaatschappijen weten dit ook! Tickets en voorziene kosten (zoals vervoer en maaltijden) lijken rond de €1000 te liggen per speler. Ons doel van €8500 zou een team van 10 spelers naar Vancouver kunnen krijgen. Dit zou het team genoeg tijd geven voor het evenement begint om door de jetlag te geraken, voordat ze aan de competitie moeten starten.Ploegen bestaan uit minstens 7 en maximum 21 spelers. Dit doel is gesteld om een ploeg van 10 personen, om te “deftig” te kunnen spelen met enkele wisselspelers, maar het is zeker niet optimaal. We proberen, door andere projecten, meer spelers naar Vancouver te krijgen maar de weg is lang. Dit alles zou wel België een plaats garanderen op het grootste, meest internationale evenement van de IQA.Deze campagne loopt tot 15 mei 2014, zodat we genoeg tijd hebben om effectief onze vliegtickets te kopen, maar ook genoeg tijd geven aan onze supporters om te doneren! Als u wenst te doneren na de campagne, aanvaard ‘Belgium Muggle Quidditch’ donaties hier!Extraatjes!Voor de extraatjes (perks) op nederlands, klick op.Zoals u kan zien, hebben we een gevarieerd aanbod van extras die u kan verkrijgen! Omdat we fans en supporters hebben op 2 verschillende continenten en meerdere landen, moeten we sommige extraatjes splitsen per continent, omdat het verzenden van zaken vanuit België nogal duur kan zijn. Sommige extraatjes kunnen bij u geleverd worden, sommige kunnen verstuurd worden vanuit Canada, en andere dan weer vanuit België zelf. Omdat onze extraatjes bepaald worden door (letterlijk) grenzen, zijn er beperkingen zijn, met name bier en ahoornsiroop. Al bij al, zijn we verheugd dat we deze zaken aan u kunnen voorbrengen zoals bier, ahoornsiroop of zelf het ‘adopteren’ van een quidkid!Wat betekent dit voor ons?We zijn nog niet zo lang bezig met quidditch hier, in het kleine België, maar dit grote toernooi is de kans van ons leven om de wereld te laten zien dat we het menen. Dat we België op de kaart kunnen zetten en een mooie toekomst geven aan de komende ploegen in België, maar zeker ook in de Benelux.HelpOns al geholpen? Of bent u helemaal platzak zelf?

</p><p><b>Hello Friends, Family, and maybe
even people I don't know,</b><br/><br/>
My name is Sarah and I'm trying to raise some money so that I can have the
chance to study abroad this summer in Russia! Despite the Russian/Ukrainian
political madness going on, the U.S. has <b><i>not</i></b> issued a ""do
not travel to"" order or anything, so as of now, the study abroad program
is still going. If I go I would be staying in St. Petersburg. You can see the
exact program outline and all the cool excursions and program details here: <br/><br/><a href=""http://www.aifsabroad.com/russia/stpetersburg/summer/index.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.aifsabroad.com/russia/stpetersburg/summer/index.asp</span></a><br/><br/>
I would be traveling through the AIFS program and the flight is included in the
total program cost. Meals, a transportation allowance, housing, and tuition are
included in the overall program fee. I would be studying the Russian language
at St. Petersburg State Polytechnic University in an intensive 5 week class. I
would also be taking a few elective courses about Russia.</p>
<p>I set my funding goal at $5,000
because that would cover the majority of my program fee. Of course if I do not
get that amount, any money donated would still go toward the program fee. The
same is true if for some reason I get over the amount I'm asking for. <br/><br/>
So, what do you get for helping me? I have 4 lovely gift levels to choose from!<br/>
Also as a super crazy bonus offer, if the $150 level sells out (25 people
donate at that level) I will throw in a secret gift. So make it happen if you
want to know what the mystery gift is!<br/><br/>
I'm asking for your help in going to Russia, because I've been studying the
Russian language now for two semesters, and I feel that it would both help me
learn the language better, and be an honor to travel to a country so close to
my Slavic heritage. I chose the summer semester to study abroad so I could
still finish my Bachelors in Psychology at Youngstown State on time. <br/><br/>
Please help me visit Russia!</p>

<p>I grew up in Germany and trained as a bilingual secretary in English and French

<p>I am fascinated by human nature and how we relate to each other.  I believe that we all can contribute to making our world a better place.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Project...</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>The book I have published in Germany has been relatively successful and tells a story that we all can identify with. I want to get it translated into English to reach a wider audience and hopefully spread the message of dreams and positivity in a setting of reality.</p>
<p>I also am researching my next book which will be set in South Africa. </p>
<p>You backing this project will make it possible for me to get the book translated into english, self publish it as well as market and distribute it worldwide. I hope that together we can create a synergy that inspires people around the world.</p>
</div> <p>I hope to build other projects on the success of this venture and someday hope that our network can provide educational opportunities to children in underprivileged communities.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>My initial aim is to raise 30 000 dollars which will be used to translate, self publish, market and distribute the book as well as setting up a web based community that focuses on the plight of underprivileged children especially regarding the development of emotional intelligence while providing opportunities for growth.</p>
<p>I dare to dream that this project is going to be successful beyond my wildest dreams and my longer term plans involve  launching the second book and hopefully getting both onto the silver screen!</p>
<p><b>So what is in it for you? </b>(Besides my eternal gratitude!)</p>
<p>Depending on the amounts contributed,I will personally send out emails and/or letters of gratitude. I will also be sending out signed prints.</p>
<p>I have 300 copies of the book (In German!) which were never distributed because I changed a few things after they were printed! Its the pre 1st edition edition! :) I will personally address and send you a signed copy if you contribute in the corresponding category.</p>
<p>Contributors will be acknowledged as founding contributors on the social development website and can also have their pictures uploaded onto the website as part of scrolling banners etc...</p>
<p>I have fortunately met somebody who can provide me with personalised T Shirts, and Caps which I will personally sign and send.</p>
<p>For the people who make REALLY big contributions :), I promise to send all of the above as well to include their names on a special page in the translated book.</p>
<p>If the book ever gets made into a movie special mention will be made of these people. They will also get cameo roles if it is possible.</p>
<p>I believe that this project is going to be amazing but in the sad event that the goals are not met, I will still stay in touch with the people who contributed, keep the money safe and keep using other avenues to raise additional funds to realise the dream..... </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Imagine a world where people are given the opportunity to reach their full potential. </p>
<p>Imagine a world where people are not judged on their gender, race, ethnicity or beliefs but rather on the attitude they have to other people and the environment.   </p>
<p>Imagine a world where people stand shoulder to shoulder and respect each others differences.                                                                                                                                 </p>
<p>Imagine a world of love and peace.</p>
<p>Ghandi said ""Be the change you want to see."" </p>
<p>I believe that we can all inspire the people around us and these little drops of positivity can add add up and become a wave of change that takes us closer to a better world. </p>
<p>This book is just a part of what I see as our contribution to inspiring dreams and positive thought...</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Like any venture, there are inherent risks involved and I will try my best to minimise these.</div>
<div>I have identified suitably qualified translators in South Africa so we can interact on a personal basis while I research my next book.</div>
<div>I have partnered with a group of Medical Doctors in South Africa who are committed to social development and who will be assisting me with some of the marketing aspects surrounding the book.</div>
<div>I plan to distribute the book as an ebook as well as a hardcopy and when the demand becomes sufficient, I am open to partnering with other parties to facilitate delivery.</div>

 I hope to build other projects on the success of this venture and someday hope that our network can provide educational opportunities to children in underprivileged communities.   What I Need & What You Get My initial aim is to raise 30 000 dollars which will be used to translate, self publish, market and distribute the book as well as setting up a web based community that focuses on the plight of underprivileged children especially regarding the development of emotional intelligence while providing opportunities for growth.
I dare to dream that this project is going to be successful beyond my wildest dreams and my longer term plans involve  launching the second book and hopefully getting both onto the silver screen!
So what is in it for you? (Besides my eternal gratitude!)
Depending on the amounts contributed,I will personally send out emails and/or letters of gratitude. I will also be sending out signed prints.
I have 300 copies of the book (In German!) which were never distributed because I changed a few things after they were printed! Its the pre 1st edition edition! :) I will personally address and send you a signed copy if you contribute in the corresponding category.
Contributors will be acknowledged as founding contributors on the social development website and can also have their pictures uploaded onto the website as part of scrolling banners etc...
I have fortunately met somebody who can provide me with personalised T Shirts, and Caps which I will personally sign and send.
For the people who make REALLY big contributions :), I promise to send all of the above as well to include their names on a special page in the translated book.
If the book ever gets made into a movie special mention will be made of these people. They will also get cameo roles if it is possible.
I believe that this project is going to be amazing but in the sad event that the goals are not met, I will still stay in touch with the people who contributed, keep the money safe and keep using other avenues to raise additional funds to realise the dream..... 

  The Impact Imagine a world where people are given the opportunity to reach their full potential. 
Imagine a world where people are not judged on their gender, race, ethnicity or beliefs but rather on the attitude they have to other people and the environment.   
Imagine a world where people stand shoulder to shoulder and respect each others differences.                                                                                                                                 
Imagine a world of love and peace.
Ghandi said ""Be the change you want to see."" 
I believe that we can all inspire the people around us and these little drops of positivity can add add up and become a wave of change that takes us closer to a better world. 
This book is just a part of what I see as our contribution to inspiring dreams and positive thought...

  Risks & Challenges
Like any venture, there are inherent risks involved and I will try my best to minimise these.
I have identified suitably qualified translators in South Africa so we can interact on a personal basis while I research my next book.
I have partnered with a group of Medical Doctors in South Africa who are committed to social development and who will be assisting me with some of the marketing aspects surrounding the book.
I plan to distribute the book as an ebook as well as a hardcopy and when the demand becomes sufficient, I am open to partnering with other parties to facilitate delivery.

<ul></ul>Greetings Family, Friends, and Community,<br/><br/>As many of you know, I am the mother of a very special 7 year old boy, who I adopted through foster care. We have been together since he was 10 months old. <br/>This summer I was reflecting a lot on what it means to be a mother, and the bond between mother and child that is so strong, it's hard to describe. I thought back to when I first decided to be a foster parent, and though I was mostly met with loving and understanding support, I was also questioned about how I could raise a child who came from someone else, and feel that bond, with the well meaning sentiment that it's not something that most people could do.<br/><br/>Well the bond is there, and it IS thick. <b>Thicker Than Blood</b>.<br/><br/>When I meet other adoptive families, I am always inspired and proud, feeling an instant bond, as if we know each others joys and struggles. Of course everyone's story is unique, but with this photographic project, I want to share the connection and my appreciation, by highlighting the many families who I have met on this journey. My 15 year old niece, a budding photographer, and I will capture the beauty and love of the diversity that makes up adoptive families.<br/><br/>With your support, we will be able to share images of these dynamic families and spread the joy and special bond that adoption brings, in hopes to inspire others.<br/><ul></ul>

The school operates on a very limited budget which comes from private donations. Many of the children are undernourished and this impacts their health, how they feel, and their ability to learn.  A light breakfast is provided at the school, but lunch is only served on special occasions, about once a month. These children come from families that Mother Theresa would call ""the poorest of the poor"".  Their parents work as laborers or farmers, but cannot  earn enough to feed their families well.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I first visited the Prema Metta School five years ago in 2009. During September and October 2014, I volunteered at Prema Metta as a teacher and teacher-trainer and got to know the school and its students, teachers and director very well over a five week period.  The students love to come to school. In many cases their parents have only minimal formal education and the families know that education will equal opportunities in the future... if the children are able to stay in school.</span></p>
<p>It was heart wrenching to see one girl have only a small piece of bread for lunch, and to see many others eat nothing at all during the ""lunch break"" each day.  I left India in mid-October with a commitment to do all I can to begin a food program which will provide a full meal daily for each child who comes to the school. </p>
<p></p>
<p>I am partnering with a couple friends of Prema Metta to set up a food program which will ensure that the children of Prema Metta will get a healthy meal at school each day. Feeding each child daily will cost .50 cents  (US) per meal. If you can only donate $5, please do that.. it will provide 10 meals. If you can donate more, please do  as it will take many of us working together, sharing what we can,  to make this program a reality. $25 will feed all fifty children for one day. $150 will feed them for a week (school meets 5 1/2 days a week, and we will provide meals Monday through Saturday). We need $11,000 to start and fund the meal program for the first year.</p>

My name is Jodi Williams and I am the Technical Director, and proud parent of a KUSD theater participant, for Bradford High School, one of six high schools that participate in our program. I have been at Bradford for fifteen years. For ten of those fifteen, we have undertaken this trip to the International Thespian Festival in Lincoln, NE.</p>
<p>Our school district is large, the third largest in Wisconsin, and our theater program is large and growing. Being a large district in an increasingly urban area means many of our schools are Title 1 and many of our students and their families cannot bridge the financial gap between the minimum education their students need and the opportunities that will help them grow, both as individuals and as post high school minded thinkers. The goal of this campaign is to fund the transportation to Lincoln for our company and help ease the overall cost for families. Last year, we pushed to raise $80,000.00 for the trip, the cost of taking our very large group to the 2015 festival. Through Indiegogo, we managed to bring in $4,000.00.

My name is Jodi Williams and I am the Technical Director, and proud parent of a KUSD theater participant, for Bradford High School, one of six high schools that participate in our program. I have been at Bradford for fifteen years. For ten of those fifteen, we have undertaken this trip to the International Thespian Festival in Lincoln, NE.
Our school district is large, the third largest in Wisconsin, and our theater program is large and growing. Being a large district in an increasingly urban area means many of our schools are Title 1 and many of our students and their families cannot bridge the financial gap between the minimum education their students need and the opportunities that will help them grow, both as individuals and as post high school minded thinkers. The goal of this campaign is to fund the transportation to Lincoln for our company and help ease the overall cost for families. Last year, we pushed to raise $80,000.00 for the trip, the cost of taking our very large group to the 2015 festival. Through Indiegogo, we managed to bring in $4,000.00. This year, we want to pay for the entire bus!

It is an invaluable experience.   What We Need & What You Get The bus cost is $11,500.00. That gets our students to and from Lincoln. Once on campus, its a walking adventure. We want to share our gratitude by including our donors in the program, sending them pictures from the trip and t-shirts so they can show their support to all.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our group is made up of three service-oriented artists studying at the University of Melbourne. Many organizations have rightly dedicated time and energy towards the academic education of disadvantaged global communities; however, artistic expression is often neglected.</p>
<p>We have received partial funding from our university for carrying out an arts-service project in East Timor whereby breakdancing, digital music production and photographic documentation skills will be taught to the youth of a rural community as an inexpensive and positive creative arts engagement.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>JJ Richardson</strong> - Breakdancing will be taught as a physical means of creative expression suitable for rural and urban communities since it can be practiced on any ground without requiring specialised equipment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Bryan Philips</strong> - Music production will be taught as a creative outlet to further cultural identity, and bring it onto the world stage through the medium of hip-hop music. With the means of a portable digital studio, participants will be enabled to produce and perform their own music. At the end of the two weeks the system will be donated to the community.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Chris Parkinson</strong> - Photography and documentation skills will be taught as a means to capture and preserve the creative and cultural identity of the Timorese people, creating important cultural transmission opportunities for the stories to be shared internationally.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Although we have recieved partial funding from the University of Melbourne that covers airfare and vaccination, we still need:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1000 for a mobile music studio, including an ipad, microphone, amplifier, headphones, and all the necessary connectors. (This will be donated to the community at the end of the project.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>$1800 for room and board (rather expensive in East Timor), and food (rather cheap) for all three of us.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>$1300 to reimburse Arte Moris for allowing us to use their facilities,  facilitators and translators.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>$400 for transportation in East Timor. (Most likely a car will be rented, because the motor bikes are rather unsafe, and taxis can be more costly/less reliable.)</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Hip-hop benefits developing countries because it provides young people with free creative outlets that can be developed independently or in a group. It bridges traditional linguistic and cultural gaps, encourages cultural consumption and promotes the sharing of knowledge on an international level. These artistic outlets can act as a cultural and creative voice for frustration, encouraging non-violent competition, a vessel for preserving tradition or an easel on which to paint contemporary culture.</p>
<p>Hip-hop is practiced in almost every country worldwide and allows isolated groups to join the international community.  The style is mainly characterised by breakdancing, hip-hop music and graffiti. Asia is developing into a powerhouse on the international hip-hop arena, however East Timor has no real scene regarding music or dance, though it does have a rich history of graffiti. Although major East Timorese cities have access to international youth trends, rural communities are more isolated, lying at the margins of cultural and economic disadvantage. In this context rural youth are at risk of disengagement from current nation building processes unless offered positive alternatives.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Our group is made up of three service-oriented artists studying at the University of Melbourne. Many organizations have rightly dedicated time and energy towards the academic education of disadvantaged global communities; however, artistic expression is often neglected.
We have received partial funding from our university for carrying out an arts-service project in East Timor whereby breakdancing, digital music production and photographic documentation skills will be taught to the youth of a rural community as an inexpensive and positive creative arts engagement.


JJ Richardson - Breakdancing will be taught as a physical means of creative expression suitable for rural and urban communities since it can be practiced on any ground without requiring specialised equipment.



Bryan Philips - Music production will be taught as a creative outlet to further cultural identity, and bring it onto the world stage through the medium of hip-hop music. With the means of a portable digital studio, participants will be enabled to produce and perform their own music. At the end of the two weeks the system will be donated to the community.



Chris Parkinson - Photography and documentation skills will be taught as a means to capture and preserve the creative and cultural identity of the Timorese people, creating important cultural transmission opportunities for the stories to be shared internationally.

The two week long project will be documented by the young participants and will culminate in a performance choreographed by those learning breakdancing and performed to the songs created in the mobile studio. This project will act as a self-contained community interaction project that will empower the Timorese youth into pursuing personal and cultural expression after the project's completion.
 


What We Need & What You Get
Although we have recieved partial funding from the University of Melbourne that covers airfare and vaccination, we still need:

$1000 for a mobile music studio, including an ipad, microphone, amplifier, headphones, and all the necessary connectors. (This will be donated to the community at the end of the project.)


$1800 for room and board (rather expensive in East Timor), and food (rather cheap) for all three of us.


$1300 to reimburse Arte Moris for allowing us to use their facilities,  facilitators and translators.


$400 for transportation in East Timor. (Most likely a car will be rented, because the motor bikes are rather unsafe, and taxis can be more costly/less reliable.)

If we don't reach our goal, we will still put the money towards these ends, although the trip may have to be shorter or the portable music studio less equipped.

<p>My name is Paula and I have dreamed of becoming a life coach for quite a few years now. I strongly feel that now is the time, but I need your help to make it happen. As a single mother, I’m used to doing things myself. Whether it’s chopping down our own Christmas tree, teaching my 16 year-old how to drive, putting myself through massage therapy school, or unclogging a blocked toilet, it’s been very important to me to show both my girls that we, as women, can do anything. That’s why asking for help is kind of hard for me; in the past, I have thought of it as a sign of weakness. But I read something recently that really hit home for me: Vulnerable is the new strong. If I’ve been told once I’ve been told a million times how strong I am. Having been through the loss of both parents, my brother, a sister, and my home, all within a 5 year period, I know I’m not only strong, I’m freaking Wonder Woman. Being vulnerable is different, though. It’s baring your soul, telling people your dreams, knowing they can shoot you down with the most off-the-cuff comments: ""Why can't you just get a regular 9-5 job, like everybody else?"", or “Are you sure that’s a good idea?”, or worse “Who are YOU to coach anyone? What’s so great about your life that you think you can tell anyone else how to live theirs?”. Well, the fact is, no coach's life is perfect. Just like some doctors have high cholesterol and some therapists have daddy issues, we're all just learning as we go. So, as the saying goes, I‘m going to “feel the fear and do it anyway“. I’ve spent the last 16 years putting my own agenda to the side so that I could focus on raising my kids &amp; afford them with everything they need, &amp; happily so, but now that my younger daughter has started high school, I can see a time in the not too distant future when I can focus on my next goal as a healer: Certified Life Coach. The only thing holding me back is the tuition.</p>
<p>I first discovered the QSCA (Quantum Success Coaching Academy) about 4 years ago, while browsing the internet looking for some training that would enhance my abilities as a healer. I’ve been a massage therapist since 2006, and I love the work I do, but I want to do more. One of my greatest joys is helping people feel better, so it seemed like a natural segue way to enter the coaching arena. I’ve spoken with several students &amp; graduates of the QSCA (and even took advantage of a few free coaching sessions!), and they have all spoken glowingly of their experience there. I’ve also spoken to a few of my closest friends and advisors to ask their frank opinions on me becoming a coach, and they have every confidence that this is a great fit for me. My experiences as a massage therapist have already led me to do some coaching, whether it’s doing a guided visualization at the end of a session, or helping a client who was trying to get pregnant by giving her some Law of Attraction tips. All of us have coached friends, whether we know it or not, just by listening, giving advice, etc., but with a certification I could make a living from it! The QSCA is fully accredited by the ICF (International Coaching Federation), and included in this program is all it takes to start your own practice, including business building and marketing strategies. I am not undertaking this venture lightly, or on a whim, I have done my research to find a reputable program-I am on a mission to make a difference, and you can make a difference by helping me! The tuition is $5,000 for the year-long program, and it includes all the materials needed to become certified.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>IMAC is a nonprofit that works withstudents in the Superintendent's Leadership Program in Montgomery County, Maryland to provide career and leadership training, service learning opportunities, and life skills.  To teach students about making an impact and provide required service learning hours for graduation, we coordinate activities that allow students to design, execute and evaluate long term projects that make impact on the underserved and most vulnerable.  Students have identified projects in tutoring, drug prevention mentoring, college mentoring, the disabled and the homeless.  For three years, the students have built on previous work to help the hungry and the homeless in our county.  There are more than 400 homeless children and more than 1250 homeless adults in our county.  The students canvas for nonperishable food to provide to shelters and food pantries; they adopt low income families and try to provide a basket of food each month along with a warm dinner; they raise money to make bag lunches for homeless shelters, and conduct awareness walks throughout the county.  They are learning how to conduct outreach through social networking and local media, as well as learning to write original articles and opinion articles to submit to the media.  IMAC teaches students, some of whom are low income or homeless, how to conduct process and outcome evaluations so that they can continually improve their work.  Over the past three years, we now have developed a model that is sustainable and allows new students to join at any time. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>(What is the impact your campaign may have on others? What if your campaign doesn't happen, what are the consequences? Make it real for people.)</p>
<p>Our model is proven to make impact on the students we serve and in turn the individuals they serve.  We help students learn to transform lives by creating sustainable programs to address pressing social issues, like hunger and homelessness.  Through our training, students are able to gain experience and skills that carry over into the workplace, thereby increasing their workforce skills.  We also ensure that students graduate from high school by providing required service learning hours that hold some back from graduating.  Peer interaction and our college information, demonstrates to all students the importance of lifelong learning. </p>
<p>The students currently working with us are coordinating a major festival that will include a pledge and mini-walk for the hungry and homeless children, packing tote bags with meals for hungry children, collecting healthy snacks for homeless children,  chef demonstration, and motivational speakers.  All walkers and visitors are being asked to donate at least $5 and 200 people are targeted.  All proceeds will go to a local children's program.  The students would like to reach a goal of $2000.  Your donation can help us get there. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need a minimum of $2000</p>
<p>$1000 will go directly to a local childrens poverty charity</p>
<p>$500 in grocery store and gift cards will be purchased for low income families</p>
<p>We have approximately $2000 already that is being used to buy monthly food baskets for adopted families and to buy the necessary items to make 100 bagged lunches for area shelters (sandwich, beverage, fruit, crackers).  The students use their own money and fundraising to purchase gifts for homeless and low income children.  We were able to work with Mattel Toys to get more than 400 toys that were donated to children in area shelters. </p>
<p>If we don't meet the $2000 goal, we will provide as many meals and gift cards as we can buy.  But we will move forward with our project, because it will raise awareness and pledges from more students and citizens to participate in this effort next year. </p>

<p><strong>Project Objective</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project objective is to build a library in the summer of 2012 at the Guanin Community Center, la Piedra, municipality Guerra, Province Santo Domingo. 45 minutes drive from Santo Domingo Capital. This Center was started with the aim of educating destitute children who would otherwise not have had an education. The Guanin Center,Inc., provides a safe and supportive environment where youth from resource poor communities (mostly in communities where poor Dominican-Haitians live) can experience new opportunities, help others who are even more needy, overcome barriers, build positive relationships, and develop confidence and skills.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We want to build this library this summer with the children and volunteers for the summer camp. Last year we built a swimming pool with the summer camp volunteers and kids. This summer the library will be our project. Please come join us, and helping build this library. During this time period, we will also be keeping a blog for you to follow with nightly journals, pictures, and videos of our progress.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your help, we hope to reach our goal of $10,000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Inspiration</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The inspiration for the project is to give an education to children that would have otherwise not had one. Most of the Haitian kids who are born in the Dominican Republic without birth certificate, cannot assist to the public school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The people of these communities live by raising chickens and a little food, but not even enough for local consumption, and by doing occasional work for hire. 60% of them are Haitian descent. They live in extreme poverty. About 60% earn less than US$2 per day, and one in three earns less than US$1 per day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They live with no running water and electricity; there are no telephone lines, no Internet or other types of technology available. The closest first aid center is a 45-minute drive away. The closest school, which only has grades Pre-K through 4, is 40 minutes walking distance. Some are ravaged by HIV Aids, and live in semi-permanent shanties. The environment in la Piedra young people's dreams and aspirations, which would be realized in most other places in the world with a little hard work and determination. Most children in la Piedra are not even aware of the possibility that they can become anything more than slum dwellers, petty thieves, prostitutes or gardeners for the nearby mansion or work only the construction industry, because they will never get Dominican birth certificate. We want to change this predicament and give them an opportunity through education - the only leveler in society. With an education opportunities to succeed can be made possible. “Education is a companion which no future can depress, no crime can destroy, no enemy can alienate it and no nepotism can enslave.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Promoting Stability in the Guanin Community Center</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>The school tackles the following three issues to promote stability</em>:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1) <strong>Ethnic Conflict: </strong>La Piedra has 100 people, 60% Haitian descent. Was founded to incorporate people from all different backgrounds. Some of the oldest residents here remember life in La Piedra (its name, appropriately, translates as ""The Rock"") in the 1940s, around 70 years ago, when all the nearby Ingenio San Luis sugar lands and the undeveloped lands around them were a small part of the vast estates of ""El Presidente"" Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, the fierce dictator who ruled the Dominican Republic from 1930-1961. After Trujillo´s assassination in May of 1961, the Dominican government laid claim to all the surrounding land and promptly sold thousands of square meters of it to an international or U.S. This library is able to attract youths from many different quarters.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2) <strong>Gender disparities</strong>: La Piedra is in dire need of community-building projects. Having realized that women are the change-makers in low-income communities, The Guanin Community Center has placed a strong emphasis on recruiting and catering to women. Currently the student body is comprised 60% of women. The school has a boarding-house for its girls, who live in la Piedra under the daily risk of gender violence and sexual assaults either en route to their homes, after school or in their homes themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3) <strong>Vocational Training: </strong>Students must be given an education that goes beyond humanities and the liberal arts and sciences. The main reason for the high rate of high school dropouts is their inability to financially support themselves as full-time students. They need to be able to learn trades with which to support their immediate needs. To this end, the curriculum was constructed to include vocational skills and allow students to meet short-term demands. The skills include: farming, small-engine repair, simple architecture, micro-finance, carpentry, brick construction skills, animal husbandry and etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Project's Impact</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Project Implementation: Guanin Community Center Library at la Piedra </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As part of a global social entrepreneurship initiative designed to create highly motivating, low cost ways to improve educational opportunities in the developing world, we will orchestrate the building of ‘Guanin Community Center Library’ in the summer of 2012 (June 22) to supplement the education.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>(1) Economy Boosting </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Labor: </strong>For the specialized jobs such as welding and electric wiring we will hire a team from Santo Domingo Capital. We will provide jobs for the community members and all our volunteers for the Summer Camp, that do not require technical skill to help build the library, including: painting, excavation, and heavy lifting. This will offer many of the students a head-start on their future vocational training with some first-hand experience. Their involvement will also aid in fostering a sense of ownership. <strong>Furniture and Fixtures: </strong>We will purchase doors, window frames, windows, desks and chairs from the local industrial area that produces the low-cost material.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>(2) Community Building and Long-Term Sustainability </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Murals: </strong>We will organize community activities that don’t require specialized labor (i.e., artwork). Murals will illustrate our tradition, getting the community as involved as possible and providing students with a sense of ownership. Our paid labor will construct the building; the students will add the personal touch, turning it into a library that they can take pride in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Books</strong>: The children of la Piedra currently have access to very few used books, most of which the kids have read a few times over. To help further their education, we will be supplying the library with over one thousand textbooks to cater for our three goals:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a) One, helping the Dominican-Haitian community to read and write.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b) Two, literacy program for youths and adults Certificate of Secondary Education.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c) Three, promoting gender equality as women have proven to be strong agents of community-building. We will buy and get these books from the Dominican Ministry of Education. On top of the curriculum books that the students will use, we will get computer and internet service. More books were specifically picked to provide the students with income-generating basic skills (e.g., farming, small engine repair, simple architecture, micro-finance, carpentry, brick laying, and animal husbandry). We concentrate on these income-generating skills because they provide short-term benefits that alleviate the abject poverty in the DR leading to lower dropout rates and keeping students in school for the long run.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>(3) Cost-Effective Materials in line with the Governing By-Laws of the Dominican Republic County Council </em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Shipping Containers: </strong>We will be using shipping containers because; we can receive books, computers and school supply free tax. Guanin Center, Inc. is a non-profit Dominican organization and we are also registered as a non-profit, charitable organization in the USA under the IRS (501c3).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through the joint effort from the library and school, the students will not just engage in academics, but also vocational training. Involvement in carpentry, tailor work and small-scale farming, English and etc., can bring short-term returns to keep students motivated and long-term benefits to education. Education is fundamental for helping to break the perpetual poverty cycle in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Through the youth, this knowledge will spread through the close-knit shanty-towns. The Guanin Community Center Library is an ethnic and community building enterprises that will create a space where young minds can be molded to realize that there are more similarities between the two genders and the different ethnic groups than there are differences.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The expenses of building the library and filling it with books will require <strong>$10,000</strong>. We realize this is a hefty sum of money, but we are all extremely dedicated to reaching our goal. Due to the small size of the group, each member must work as hard as possible to procure as much money as possible to make this project happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are raising funds in three phases:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>a) First, procuring funds to fix and building structure to build one side in block and segment, the old truck the first Dominican Lady donated to us 1 year ago;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>b) Second, fund-raising for the furniture to be used in the library;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>c) Third, procuring funds for buying books and purchasing shipping containers of school supply.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Every donation, regardless of size will truly help make a difference! We ask you to kindly consider this and please help support our mission! Each and every one of us knows that without your kind help, and many others', this could not happen. Thank you so incredibly much.</p>

The project objective is to build a library in the summer of 2012 at the Guanin Community Center, la Piedra, municipality Guerra, Province Santo Domingo. 45 minutes drive from Santo Domingo Capital. This Center was started with the aim of educating destitute children who would otherwise not have had an education. The Guanin Center,Inc., provides a safe and supportive environment where youth from resource poor communities (mostly in communities where poor Dominican-Haitians live) can experience new opportunities, help others who are even more needy, overcome barriers, build positive relationships, and develop confidence and skills.
 
We want to build this library this summer with the children and volunteers for the summer camp. Last year we built a swimming pool with the summer camp volunteers and kids. This summer the library will be our project. Please come join us, and helping build this library. During this time period, we will also be keeping a blog for you to follow with nightly journals, pictures, and videos of our progress.
 
With your help, we hope to reach our goal of $10,000.
 
The Inspiration
 
The inspiration for the project is to give an education to children that would have otherwise not had one. Most of the Haitian kids who are born in the Dominican Republic without birth certificate, cannot assist to the public school.
 
The people of these communities live by raising chickens and a little food, but not even enough for local consumption, and by doing occasional work for hire. 60% of them are Haitian descent. They live in extreme poverty. About 60% earn less than US$2 per day, and one in three earns less than US$1 per day.
 
They live with no running water and electricity; there are no telephone lines, no Internet or other types of technology available. The closest first aid center is a 45-minute drive away. The closest school, which only has grades Pre-K through 4, is 40 minutes walking distance. Some are ravaged by HIV Aids, and live in semi-permanent shanties. The environment in la Piedra young people's dreams and aspirations, which would be realized in most other places in the world with a little hard work and determination. Most children in la Piedra are not even aware of the possibility that they can become anything more than slum dwellers, petty thieves, prostitutes or gardeners for the nearby mansion or work only the construction industry, because they will never get Dominican birth certificate. We want to change this predicament and give them an opportunity through education - the only leveler in society. With an education opportunities to succeed can be made possible. “Education is a companion which no future can depress, no crime can destroy, no enemy can alienate it and no nepotism can enslave.”
 
Promoting Stability in the Guanin Community Center
 
The school tackles the following three issues to promote stability:
 
1) Ethnic Conflict: La Piedra has 100 people, 60% Haitian descent. Was founded to incorporate people from all different backgrounds. Some of the oldest residents here remember life in La Piedra (its name, appropriately, translates as ""The Rock"") in the 1940s, around 70 years ago, when all the nearby Ingenio San Luis sugar lands and the undeveloped lands around them were a small part of the vast estates of ""El Presidente"" Rafael Leónidas Trujillo, the fierce dictator who ruled the Dominican Republic from 1930-1961. After Trujillo´s assassination in May of 1961, the Dominican government laid claim to all the surrounding land and promptly sold thousands of square meters of it to an international or U.S. This library is able to attract youths from many different quarters.
 
2) Gender disparities: La Piedra is in dire need of community-building projects. Having realized that women are the change-makers in low-income communities, The Guanin Community Center has placed a strong emphasis on recruiting and catering to women. Currently the student body is comprised 60% of women. The school has a boarding-house for its girls, who live in la Piedra under the daily risk of gender violence and sexual assaults either en route to their homes, after school or in their homes themselves.
 
3) Vocational Training: Students must be given an education that goes beyond humanities and the liberal arts and sciences. The main reason for the high rate of high school dropouts is their inability to financially support themselves as full-time students. They need to be able to learn trades with which to support their immediate needs. To this end, the curriculum was constructed to include vocational skills and allow students to meet short-term demands. The skills include: farming, small-engine repair, simple architecture, micro-finance, carpentry, brick construction skills, animal husbandry and etc.
 
Project's Impact
 
Project Implementation: Guanin Community Center Library at la Piedra 
 
As part of a global social entrepreneurship initiative designed to create highly motivating, low cost ways to improve educational opportunities in the developing world, we will orchestrate the building of ‘Guanin Community Center Library’ in the summer of 2012 (June 22) to supplement the education.
 
(1) Economy Boosting 
 
 
 
Labor: For the specialized jobs such as welding and electric wiring we will hire a team from Santo Domingo Capital. We will provide jobs for the community members and all our volunteers for the Summer Camp, that do not require technical skill to help build the library, including: painting, excavation, and heavy lifting. This will offer many of the students a head-start on their future vocational training with some first-hand experience. Their involvement will also aid in fostering a sense of ownership. Furniture and Fixtures: We will purchase doors, window frames, windows, desks and chairs from the local industrial area that produces the low-cost material.
 
(2) Community Building and Long-Term Sustainability 
 
Murals: We will organize community activities that don’t require specialized labor (i.e., artwork). Murals will illustrate our tradition, getting the community as involved as possible and providing students with a sense of ownership. Our paid labor will construct the building; the students will add the personal touch, turning it into a library that they can take pride in.
 
Books: The children of la Piedra currently have access to very few used books, most of which the kids have read a few times over. To help further their education, we will be supplying the library with over one thousand textbooks to cater for our three goals:
 
a) One, helping the Dominican-Haitian community to read and write.
 
b) Two, literacy program for youths and adults Certificate of Secondary Education.
 
c) Three, promoting gender equality as women have proven to be strong agents of community-building. We will buy and get these books from the Dominican Ministry of Education. On top of the curriculum books that the students will use, we will get computer and internet service. More books were specifically picked to provide the students with income-generating basic skills (e.g., farming, small engine repair, simple architecture, micro-finance, carpentry, brick laying, and animal husbandry). We concentrate on these income-generating skills because they provide short-term benefits that alleviate the abject poverty in the DR leading to lower dropout rates and keeping students in school for the long run.
 
(3) Cost-Effective Materials in line with the Governing By-Laws of the Dominican Republic County Council 
 
Shipping Containers: We will be using shipping containers because; we can receive books, computers and school supply free tax. Guanin Center, Inc. is a non-profit Dominican organization and we are also registered as a non-profit, charitable organization in the USA under the IRS (501c3).
 
Through the joint effort from the library and school, the students will not just engage in academics, but also vocational training. Involvement in carpentry, tailor work and small-scale farming, English and etc., can bring short-term returns to keep students motivated and long-term benefits to education. Education is fundamental for helping to break the perpetual poverty cycle in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Through the youth, this knowledge will spread through the close-knit shanty-towns. The Guanin Community Center Library is an ethnic and community building enterprises that will create a space where young minds can be molded to realize that there are more similarities between the two genders and the different ethnic groups than there are differences.
 
What We Need
 
The expenses of building the library and filling it with books will require $10,000. We realize this is a hefty sum of money, but we are all extremely dedicated to reaching our goal. Due to the small size of the group, each member must work as hard as possible to procure as much money as possible to make this project happen.
 
We are raising funds in three phases:
 
a) First, procuring funds to fix and building structure to build one side in block and segment, the old truck the first Dominican Lady donated to us 1 year ago;
 
b) Second, fund-raising for the furniture to be used in the library;
 
c) Third, procuring funds for buying books and purchasing shipping containers of school supply.
 
Every donation, regardless of size will truly help make a difference! We ask you to kindly consider this and please help support our mission! Each and every one of us knows that without your kind help, and many others', this could not happen. Thank you so incredibly much.

First, by contributing you will get the wonderful feeling of knowing you have impacted the lives of others!
All ll levels of support will come with a heartfelt thank you card!

<h3>What Happened?</h3>
<p>Malala Yousafzai, a 14 year old girl, and an outspoken activist for girls' education was shot in the head and neck while she sat with classmates on a school bus as it prepared to drive students home after morning classes in Mingora, a city in the Swat valley of Pakistan. </p>
<p>Police said a man approached the bus and asked which of the girls was Malala. When one of the girls pointed at her, she denied it. The gunman shot both girls. Malala is currently in critical condition and struggling to stay alive.</p>
<p>A Taliban spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, claimed responsibility on behalf of the Pakistani Taliban. Among other horrific things, the terrorist group is notorious for its restrictions of women's freedom and female education.</p>
<p>The Taliban had previously announced she was on their ""hit list"".</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Want To Do About It</h3>
<p>We want to help ensure that Malala's dream of girls having a chance to be educated in Pakistan stays alive. This barbaric act must not go unanswered. We believe the best way to achieve this goal is to help fund schools in Malala's honor in Pakistan and we need your help.</p>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are in a position to donate money towards the cause, then please do so. If you are not, please help to spread the word about this campaign via e-mail, Facebook, Twitter, Google + or using any other method you can.</p>

<h3>The Urgency</h3>
<p>Attention quickly fades, even from the most horrific acts. Usually another horrific act is not far behind. We need everyone to donate and get the word out NOW, so we don't miss the opportunity while this tragedy is still fresh in the minds of people across the world. Our urgent action will help to ensure that a lasting institution will be built to help keep Malala's dream alive. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>We are proud to announce that all funds raised through this campaign will be donated to Developments in Literacy (DIL). The funds will be allocated specifically to funding education in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the province where Malala lives. DIL operates 34 schools in the province where Malala lives and where she was attacked. DIL educates and empowers underprivileged students, especially girls, by operating student-centered model schools; and provides high-quality professional development to teachers and principals across Pakistan. </p>

<p><strong>The DIL statement on this campaign:</strong></p>
<p>The attack on Malala is shocking and shameful. Her bravery and leadership are an inspiration. DIL schools provide quality education to thousands of girls like Malala, empowering them to become leaders and citizens and speak up confidently for their rights. The organization operates 179 school units across Pakistan, educating 17,062 children, of which 68% are girls. There are 34 DIL schools in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, where female literacy is held back by difficult mountainous terrain, lack of roads, and conservative tribal traditions. It costs DIL $100 a year to educate a child. Honor Malala today by supporting quality education for girls. </p>
<p><strong>More Details on Developments in Literacy (DIL):</strong></p>
<p>DIL operates under the auspices of a US-based Board of Directors and a Pakistan-based Board of Trustees. DIL was granted tax-exempt status 501 (c) (3) by the IRS in February 2000.</p>
<p>DIL was registered in July 2000 in Pakistan under the Societies Registration Act 1860 and donations received in Pakistan are tax-exempt.  All members of the Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees are volunteers and serve without compensation.</p>
<p><strong>What New York Times columnist Nicolas Kristof (Half the Sky) thinks of DIL:</strong></p>
<p>""Developments in Literacy, <a href=""http://www.dil.org/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.dil.org</a>, builds terrific modern schools in Pakistan, particularly for girls.

I will enrich my knowledge of Italy with first-hand experience, and I have been awarded the opportunity to explore and am ready for the challenge. In order to fully enjoy this amazing opportunity, I need to raise $5,500.00 which helps to pay for the study abroad program two semesters. As most of you know my 20th birthday is November 19th, I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider contributing to the fund or perhaps make it an early holiday gift as I leave the first week in January 2015.</p>

PLEASE HELP ME REACH MY GOAL BY BACKING THE CAMPAIGN AT $25, $50, or a $100 TODAY.
But first, let me introduce myself.
 
My story
 
 
 

I'm Olivia. You've probably seen photos of me traveling. Maybe we went to college together. Perhaps we're childhood friends.  One way or another, you know me.  And I know you. 
It's been hard to keep in touch; I know.  I don't blame you if you've deleted my contact info because every time you reach out you get a reply, ""returned to sender."" 
Well, that's because, for the last six years, I've been exploring a lot of different things.  I majored in International Relations, but when I graduated college, I really didn't have any relations internationally.  So I set out to study the world. 
Since then, I've worked for a variety of nonprofits, found one of my own -- which was recognized by the Clinton Foundation -- built a soccer field for a school in Nepal, and researched nuclear radiation in Japan. Last summer, I backpacked the Middle East alone and led a project in a Syrian refugee camp with the support of the United Nations.
 

You may be familiar with Zaatari in Al Mafraq, Jordan. Angelina Jolie and UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-Moon's visits last year brought great international attention to this Syrian refugee camp. 
 

Fatima and Ezra narrowly escaped death and traveled on foot from their hometown in Syria to neighboring Jordan. They would later convince me to start #GirlsRising.
 
 
 

 
This photo was taken just 1 week before chemical weapons were used on the Syrian people. I often think about where these kids are now, and if they're still alive.
 

These girls and boys proved to me that soccer has the power to lift an entire community. I love this picture because it reminds me of my favorite quote by Gandhi, ""The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.""
 

I love rainy days especially at the Sarswati Peace School in Nepal. I call this photo, ""How to read extremely confusing children's pop-up books.""      

About Hive

 

 
  

 
 
A unique situation
For the past year, I've been volunteering to serve 250 refugee and immigrant youth using soccer and education while living under the poverty line.  I took a chance, got accepted to Hive, and crossed my fingers thinking: ""If there's a will, there's a way."" 
However, my tuition is not covered.  If I can't raise the money, I might have to back out.  I'm cringing at the thought of it.  I rather spend winter in Antarctica before retracting my acceptance.
 

What I need and how you can help
I need to raise $1,200. Just so you know, 100% of all the money raised (including anything we get after hitting our goal) will go directly toward leadership development and training.
 
 
 
$1,200 secures:

unparalleled education & training at Hive (tuition)
food
transportation (1 economy class R/T ticket from San Diego to San Francisco)
preparatory reading materials
conference materials
a good night's sleep

<p>It’s been over a year since my husband joined the United
States Air Force. There are always ups and downs with any changes in life but
the hardest thing to deal with is being so far away from our family and
friends. We moved from the big city of Phoenix, Arizona to the very small town
of Goldsboro, North Carolina (1 hour away from Raleigh). Now we’ve tried to
make friends and be a part of the military community but unfortunately it’s been
tough to adapt to the change. He works hard every single day and rarely
complains but I know that he wishes things were different. Whenever we take a
step forward financially, we always have to take two steps back and it’s
frustrating. We don’t have a lot to go out or splurge on anything because we’re
trying to be debt free. I know he deserves to visit our family and friends and
I want to give this to him so badly. Our finances make it difficult to save up
for the flights. Reaching our campaign goal will give us just enough to fly
roundtrip, so please help us see our loved ones. Every little bit counts!</p><br/></div>","About Us

knowing where to go or who to ask for help. Fortunately for them, Wilma, our
founder and president, was there; ready to give them any help and support they
needed to cope with it. For example, Zoila, a single mother of Jason, a 14-year-old boy, diagnosed with autistc spectrum disorder. For her, BIA is the only place she has to turn to, and they listen to her, and help her during moments of depression and difficulties. In her own words ""they give me strength to keep on going raising my son.""</p>
<p>Wilma has been in their shoes, when she supported her sister coping with her son with autistic spectrum disorder, researching about the syndrome and seeking any
assistance her nephew needed and still needs to this day. Wilma’s personal
experience and knowledge has motivated her to found BIA and enabled her to provide

Yet it is in these villages that an amazing transformation, at once exhilerating and deeply inspiring, is happening. A transformation through quality education, exposure to the creative arts and music, and shared values because the talent and ingenuity of a Haitian mind is too important to waste. Such are the aim and achievements of the <strong>Love and Serve Haiti</strong> Project.<br/><br/>Spearheaded by by two Haitian-led non-profits, the NY-based <em><strong>Haitian-Americans United for Progress (HAUP)</strong></em> and the Haiti-based <em><strong>Pou Solèy Leve</strong></em>, Love and Serve Haiti supports the schooling of some 650 children, for whom access to knowledge would otherwise be nothing but an impossible dream.<br/><br/>Yet <strong>Love and Serve Haiti</strong> does not stop there. It is also a transformative experience for young Americans who are challenged to affirm their leadership qualities and potential, and anchor their commitment to community with a year-long service project.</p>
<p>Founded some 39 years ago to promote the welfare of Haitian immigrants and refugees in the United States, HAUP is a multi-service agency that has consistently earned high marks for its delivery of services to the people of New York and Haiti.

<p>We have been building support all year long for the children of Masson and Sarazin through creative partnerships with fashion designers, fashion photographers, and others in the non-profit and corporate world. We are however short of the funds needed to implement fully the crucial summer school program. This includes the climatic moment -- which is fast approaching -- when the young American leaders undertake a comprehensive field visit to Haiti over a 10-day period in August.

<p><em>A volcanic eruption blasts 40 feet into the air, splattering the facades of downtown Johnson City with the effervescing lava. The eruption—a science experiment involving carbon dioxide, surface tension, and pressure —is met with peals of laughter and exclamations of delight from the on-looking, wide-eyed children. “Awesome!...</em>How does it work? Can we make it reach higher?”</p>
<p>The purpose of Hands On! Regional Museum is to get kids asking these types of questions. Now it is time for grown-ups to ask the same questions. How does it work, and can we reach even higher?</p>
<p>Hands On! Regional Museum has been open for over 25 years serving children and their families with interactive permanent exhibits and programming that inspires discovery and understanding of science and the arts.  70,000+ guests from our region and beyond visit Hands On! each year and we want to keep them coming back!</p>
<p>This summer, we are asking the community for support and launching a Focused Giving Campaign to sustain and stabilize the museum’s annual operations.  In five years we would like to serve the region from a new facility and this is the first step on that path!  Your gift will help us reach our goals!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Many people may not realize that it costs $11 per visitor to operate the museum but Hands On! only charges $8 for general admission and reduced or even free rates are available for those who qualify, leaving the museum with a shortfall for each and every visitor.   It is a goal of the museum that every child can visit with his or her family or school group, regardless of that family’s ability to pay.</p>
<p>Did you know that for our facility the utility costs (for gas, electric, and water) are $500 each week? Our staff works hard to keep costs as low as possible and to be good stewards of our donors’ money but many costs aren’t negotiable – insurance, employee costs, utilities, etc. – are all a part of our business.  The average cost to install a new exhibit is $300 per square foot!  Exhibits have to be highly specialized to be safe for our visitors and very durable to withstand the many hands that touch them each year. </p>
<p>Every dollar we raise helps supplement these operational costs and allows us to keep our admission prices low and offer reduced and free admissions. </p>
<p>Your support fulfills our mission: to inspire discovery and understanding of science and the arts in a place where learning and fun go hand in hand.  A child experiencing the joy of hands-on learning is the first step toward a love of life-long learning.  An investment in Hands On! is an investment in our community and the next generation.</p>
<p>As you can see, our donor benefits are based on providing educational, hands-on learning opportunities to children – free passes and annual memberships.  As a donor, you can keep these for your family or give them to someone who would value a visit to Hands On!  Even one exciting experience can make a difference in the life of a child.  We have had visitors tell us they loved our Cessna 150 airplane so much that they decided to be a pilot and that our Amazing Me (health) exhibit helped a mother explain to a small child what caused the grandfather’s heart attack and why exercise and healthy eating would help him recover.  These are just two example of how Hands On! makes a difference in the lives of the children we serve.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>On a community level, attendance is expected to reach 75,000 this fiscal year.  Hands On! has become a destination for children both with their friends and families as well as school groups.  Each year, the museum sees families visiting from nearly all 50 states and school groups from a 40 county area in Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky.  This makes an economic impact on our community as well as promoting downtown revitalization and increasing tourism dollars as visitors to Hands On! stop to eat, enjoy other amenities, buy gas, or spend the night.</p>
<p>Hands On! is not only a treasured part of the downtown community, it is a part of what it means to grow up in this area. The museum holds a special place in the childhood memories of thousands of individuals across our region. After 25 years of operation, former visitors are visiting again with children of their own. While many of the exhibits are different, there are still a few old favorites and the joy and excitement of a Hands On! visit is still found every day. </p>
<p>Sustaining and growing the museum to serve new generations is the best tribute that can be made to the Hands On! legacy.  The families in this region deserve a Hands On! Regional Museum.  At Hands On!, we envision serving this community from a new facility within 5 years—a goal we can meet with your help.

A volcanic eruption blasts 40 feet into the air, splattering the facades of downtown Johnson City with the effervescing lava. The eruption—a science experiment involving carbon dioxide, surface tension, and pressure —is met with peals of laughter and exclamations of delight from the on-looking, wide-eyed children. “Awesome!...How does it work? Can we make it reach higher?”
The purpose of Hands On! Regional Museum is to get kids asking these types of questions. Now it is time for grown-ups to ask the same questions. How does it work, and can we reach even higher?
Hands On! Regional Museum has been open for over 25 years serving children and their families with interactive permanent exhibits and programming that inspires discovery and understanding of science and the arts.  70,000+ guests from our region and beyond visit Hands On! each year and we want to keep them coming back!
This summer, we are asking the community for support and launching a Focused Giving Campaign to sustain and stabilize the museum’s annual operations.  In five years we would like to serve the region from a new facility and this is the first step on that path!  Your gift will help us reach our goals!
What We Need & What You Get
Many people may not realize that it costs $11 per visitor to operate the museum but Hands On! only charges $8 for general admission and reduced or even free rates are available for those who qualify, leaving the museum with a shortfall for each and every visitor.   It is a goal of the museum that every child can visit with his or her family or school group, regardless of that family’s ability to pay.
Did you know that for our facility the utility costs (for gas, electric, and water) are $500 each week? Our staff works hard to keep costs as low as possible and to be good stewards of our donors’ money but many costs aren’t negotiable – insurance, employee costs, utilities, etc. – are all a part of our business.  The average cost to install a new exhibit is $300 per square foot!  Exhibits have to be highly specialized to be safe for our visitors and very durable to withstand the many hands that touch them each year. 
Every dollar we raise helps supplement these operational costs and allows us to keep our admission prices low and offer reduced and free admissions. 
Your support fulfills our mission: to inspire discovery and understanding of science and the arts in a place where learning and fun go hand in hand.  A child experiencing the joy of hands-on learning is the first step toward a love of life-long learning.  An investment in Hands On! is an investment in our community and the next generation.
As you can see, our donor benefits are based on providing educational, hands-on learning opportunities to children – free passes and annual memberships.  As a donor, you can keep these for your family or give them to someone who would value a visit to Hands On!  Even one exciting experience can make a difference in the life of a child.  We have had visitors tell us they loved our Cessna 150 airplane so much that they decided to be a pilot and that our Amazing Me (health) exhibit helped a mother explain to a small child what caused the grandfather’s heart attack and why exercise and healthy eating would help him recover.  These are just two example of how Hands On! makes a difference in the lives of the children we serve.
The Impact
On a community level, attendance is expected to reach 75,000 this fiscal year.  Hands On! has become a destination for children both with their friends and families as well as school groups.  Each year, the museum sees families visiting from nearly all 50 states and school groups from a 40 county area in Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky.  This makes an economic impact on our community as well as promoting downtown revitalization and increasing tourism dollars as visitors to Hands On! stop to eat, enjoy other amenities, buy gas, or spend the night.
Hands On! is not only a treasured part of the downtown community, it is a part of what it means to grow up in this area. The museum holds a special place in the childhood memories of thousands of individuals across our region. After 25 years of operation, former visitors are visiting again with children of their own. While many of the exhibits are different, there are still a few old favorites and the joy and excitement of a Hands On! visit is still found every day. 
Sustaining and growing the museum to serve new generations is the best tribute that can be made to the Hands On! legacy.  The families in this region deserve a Hands On! Regional Museum.  At Hands On!, we envision serving this community from a new facility within 5 years—a goal we can meet with your help. The first step is getting a solid foundation of operational support on which to build.

<h3>April 7, 2013, Where are we today?</h3>
On April 5, the first of two Opening Doors Countryside sessions took place in Snom Prampy Secondary School near Kampot. In blistering heat, 120 [60M/60F] interested and motivated students listened to the lessons about the impact of sexual abuse and exploitation, how to recognize suspicious behaviors and where and how to report abuse and to seek for protection, which was explained and conducted by two members of APLE Sihanoukville's investigation team. All students received information cards with a summary of the lessons learned and a t-shirt with the phone-numbers from APLE and the Anti-Human Trafficking and Juvenile Protection Police. After the training the participants and other villagers were treated with a joyful performance of Khmer rock 'n' roll by The Kampot Playboys.<br/>The whole campaign was being made possible by the donations from 33 private donors from all over the world. On behalf of the villages we visited, APLE and The Kampot Playboys say THANK YOU to all donors for making this possible. Today we will visit Prey Khmum village and pictures of that event will follow tomorrow.<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>On April 6, APLE and The Kampot Playboys brought the Opening Doors Countryside Tour to Prey Khmum village at the foot of Phnom Sor Mountain. After a funny welcome speech by the commune chief, who stayed and enjoyed until the almost end of the event, the training started in which 100 invited secondary school students [46M/54F] and 20 community leaders and teachers [10M/10F] participated. Although the annual Khmer New Year holiday already had started, the commune chief and the head school master made the students return to school for one day to be educated about all aspects of child sexual abuse and exploitation and related issues. Additionally, another 40 village kids joined the event. Following the educational session was another groovy set of rock ‘n’ roll by The Kampot Playboys, which even made the chief monk of the nearby pagoda tap his feet on the ground.</p>

<h3>Why were we doing this?</h3>
<p>After having been on a theatre performance tour in rural villages in Cambodia with Canadian theatre and dance group Corpus, late 2011, and a musical concert series, early 2012, with local and western performers, including Mr. Conrad Keely from US rock band And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead, the idea was born among the participating artists to do similar events more often, and to combine entertainment and culture with more serious matters to create a project that can be of great benefit to local communities. With the signs of child sexual abuse and exploitation being so obvious in Cambodia, it was the logical topic to pick and to say: we want to do something against it and prevent it, to make it stop. We regularly would like to do a series of concerts by Cambodian and foreign artists, reaching communities that normally have no access to cultural activities and modern arts. </p>
<p><img alt=""April 5, Phnom Prampy Secondary School"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/742336/pictures/full/20130405211424-IMG_7576a.jpg?1365221670"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Due to Cambodia's high poverty rate many children in Cambodia are vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation. Additionally, cultural specificities, such as the traditionally valued honour and reputation of the family and the desire to maintain harmony above all, contribute to a “culture of silence” surrounding child sexual abuse and it creates a climate where child abuse and exploitation can exist and grow. APLE believes that an informed and educated community is the best defense against child sexual abuse. To achieve this APLE works together with police and community leaders to spread information about how to recognize abuser's approaches, prevent sexual abuse from happening, and report suspected incidents through village meetings, performances, awareness and training, and advertising, all emphasizing prevention.</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p><strong>APLE Cambodia - Action Pour Les Enfants</strong> is a Cambodia-based advocacy group operating since 2003. APLE's work has led to the arrest and subsequent prosecution of more than 243 child sex offenders (155 successful convictions, 25 cases still pending) and has tirelessly provided social and legal support and counseling for more than 600 victims and their families. In addition, APLE provided thousands of street-children with education about sexual abuse. APLE also works with the Cambodian government and international law enforcement agencies advising on how to minimize loopholes in the existing laws and creating new legislation so that offenders may be more effectively prosecuted, providing justice and protection for the victims. </p>

<p><strong>The Kampot Playboys </strong>exist out of four core members and a collective of varying Khmer and non-Cambodian musicians, who play traditional Cambodian music with influences from Irish folk, Americana, rock and punk. The reason to be involved in the project is to get out of the white bubble entertainment venues and to give something back to the communities and the country where everybody currently loves to live and work and/or is having families..</p>

<p><strong>Antonia's Journey Home</strong><br/><br/>Our dear friend Nina is a gifted and kind Special Education teacher in a public school in New York City.

<p><strong>Updates to come:<br/></strong>As soon as Antonia is home, we will be able to post photos of Nina and Antonia together.  To protect Antonia's privacy and the adoption, we cannot yet share specifics.  However, we are expecting the journey home to be complete soon, and will post photos and details about her age, birth country, personality, and her new home as soon as the adoption agency permits it.</p>

<p><em>From the beginning of this process through this moment right now, one sentiment has been present:  humbling.  Love and worry have grown, patience has waned, but this feeling of humility has been present throughout.

<h2><strong>Defying Gravity</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>""He climbs highest who lifts another up"" - George Matthew Adams</strong></h2>
<p>Defying gravity is a local group started by four women who feel passionately about rock climbing and bouldering. We want to foster a love of climbing in our local youth and all the positive things that go with it, including a sense of community, pride and confidence, love of the sport, and stewardship for the land. Instilling these values in our climbing youth will provide a stronger climbing community for future generations</p>
<p>This campaign was launched specifically to assist in funding the things necessary to build and sustain a strong youth climbing community and competitive bouldering team in Missoula, MT. The first thing we need to be able to do is become a recognized non-profit by filing our tax documents. The funds raised here will be used to pay the filing fees.</p>
<p>Climbing is becoming quite the elite sport and we'd like to help offset the high cost of climbing team membership by raising funds. This can help reduce the cost to the families and kids so that membership to the climbing team can be a reality for any interested child, regardless of family income.</p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>We would like to raise at least $400 prior to the next competitive season in order to file our tax documents to become a 501c3.</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3><strong>What you get when you donate:</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><ul>
<li>The wonderful feeling to know that you are contributing to the future of climbing by fostering a love of climbing in children</li>
<li>The warm and fuzzy feeling of knowing you are contributing to confidence, team atmosphere, and the healthy activity in our youth</li>
</ul></ul>
<h3><em>Even if we do not reach our entire goal, we will contribute every dollar raised to benefit our climbing kids and cover as much of the above described costs as possible.</em></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to this campaign can make a huge difference in a child's life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many of the kids on our team are very independant thinkers and don't fit with the traditional sports team. This team is like no other! These kids are fiercely competitive, as much with their own best climbing as with other climbers. At the same time, they support every climber they've ever met and especially each other! They build a strong community of young climbers across Montana and across the Western US.</li>
<li>These kids are the future of our climbing community and need our support to continue to thrive!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Even if you can't donate directly, please share on your website, twitter, facebook, and any other means possible! And remember that every share and and every dollar makes a difference!</p>

</div><div>Please help us to share our message and reach the target before the deadline!!</div><div>Thank you for reading,</div><div>The Resource Centre Team.</div></div>","Howdy,The Resource Centre team is made up of local and international volunteers who are taking part in the UK's International Citizenship Service for the NGO International Service and working together with the permanent staff of the Resource Centre. The Resource Centre for Persons with Disabilities also unifies and represents:
Ghana Society of the Physically Disabled
Ghana Blind Union
Ghana Association of the Deaf
Association of Parents and Guardians of Children with Disabilities

We are determined to use our time together as efficiently as possible to work towards our goals, one of the most important of which is to provide information about and challenge stigma surrounding disability issues in the Northern Region of Ghana.
Everybody has different abilities and disabilities, some being more or less noticable than others, and we believe that nobody should be defined by or discriminated against because of these. However some of the main debilitators for persons with disabilities the world over are ignorance, misinformation, prejudices and discrimination.
From our research and the personal experience of some of the members of the Resource Centre it is apparent that society is still unfortunately relatively ignorant on disability issues here and many negative connotations remain attached to those persons living with a disability.
For example there is still a common belief that disability is a curse given to the person because of their or their family's actions and even when this is not the case, people with disabilities are not generally seen as equally capable members of society. Statistics show they find it harder to find work and many make a living by begging. 
These prejudices are passed along through society many times and the family/community to those living with a disability so that they feel ashamed and consider themselves as useless to society and/or their families. 
You can help us to try and change this!!We realise there are many fundraisers out there and it's impossible to give something to them all. We can't say ours is more important, but we can promise that the money you give is going towards a project which is happening now and which we are overseeing directly. Nothing will be wasted: what you give, no matter the amount will be spent on something tangible, on-going and sustainable which will have long-lasting results: we will be able to provide evidence of this to you.We are running a region-wide sensitization programme to a range of communities and schools (primary, secondary and Special schools) which include a variety of activities, an interactive presentation full of information on disabilty and soon, with your help, videos of para-sports, short films and documentaries on disability.After our last sensitization programme we realised how hard it is to describe to a person who has never heard of para-sports what they involve and how they are played. In the same way it is hard to get a room of people to envisage the amazing feats of somebody with a disability and their courage in the face of adversity through words alone. ""A picture tells a thousand words""  And we believe a video can tell a million. We are passionate endorsers of the power of image and the persuasiveness of documentary film. One of the things we want to show is the UK made ""Superhuman Paralympics Campaign"", not only so the people here can appreciate what these individuals achieved despite and because of their ""disability"", but also to encourage the youth of Ghana to take part in para-sports themselves.We also want to show ""Emmanuel's Gift"", a true and inspiring story of a Ghanaian orphan with one leg who rode across the nation of Ghana to spread his message.
We agree with Nelson Mandela that:

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;""><p></p></span>

</div><p>C'era una volta un isola di
soli 24 Km² che riposava nella parte bassa del Mediterraneo. Un giorno l’allora
Ministro degli Interni del Governo Italiano decise che un centro di detenzione
per migranti non era abbastanza e propose di costruirne un secondo. La
popolazione locale si ribellò e dalle ceneri di quella rivolta nacquero due ambiziosi progetti
di resistenza creativa: l'Associazione Askavusa e il Lampedusa In Festival. Questa
e' piu o meno la storia che da allora si narra nelle notti d'inverno, quando
fuori, il Maestrale soffia forte. </p>
<p>Il Lampedusa In Festival, giunto
alla sua VI edizione, vuole continuare a trattare argomenti quali
la migrazione, le libertà civili e gli effetti della globalizzazione sulla
società, attraverso dibattiti aperti e forme d'arte quali il cinema, il teatro,
la musica, la letteratura, etc. Per garantire l' indipendenza ideologica e
politica dell'evento, e quindi un alto livello di denuncia, negli anni si è
scelto di utilizzare, sempre di più, forme di finanziamento dal basso. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Così arriviamo ai giorni nostri e al perchè ci troviamo qui.</span></p>
<p><b>Chi siamo </b></p>
<p>Askavusa é un collettivo nato
nel Marzo del 2009 a
Lampedusa, dopo le proteste contro la creazione di un secondo centro
detentivo per migranti. Nel corso degli anni, il collettivo si é impegnato
sul territorio organizzando attivita' politico-culturali e per la
promozione del territorio. Allo stesso tempo ha portato avanti un intenso lavoro di denuncia circa cause e conseguenze dei fenomeni migratori che attraversano il
Mediterraneo. Assieme al festival, il collettivo ha da tempo portato
avanti un lavoro di raccolta e conservazione di oggetti rinvenuti sui
barconi usati dai migranti per attraversare lo stretto di Sicilia, e che a
Lampedusa sono arrivati. Questo ha dato vita a PortoM: un
esposizione permanente del passaggio e delle storie di migliaia di esseri umani sull'isola
di Lampedusa. </p>
<p><b>Perche'
Contribuire</b></p>
<p>Il Lampedusa in Festival e'
un evento culturale che vuole raccontare storie troppo spesso dimenticate, conservando
la memoria del Mar Mediterraneo e di tutto quello che rappresenta: punto
d'incontro e di rottura tra mondi vicini e lontani.</p>
<p>Col tuo contributo potrai
aiutarci a portare avanti questo lavoro, a tramandare le vicende degli abitanti
di questa piccola isola e di tutti quelli che qua sono passati e passeranno.
Per supportare la nostra indipendenza  vi chiediamo di finanziare - anche
con un piccolo gesto - questo progetto, permettendoci di dare voce sia ai
migranti che agli abitanti di Lampedusa, luogo di cui tutti parlano ma che
nessuno ascolta.</p>
<p><b>Come
contribuire </b></p>
<p>Ogni anno il festival viene ideato e realizzato grazie all'impegno del
collettivo Askavusa e all’aiuto di amici ed attivisti. Ci sono però costi che
non possono essere evitati, come l'accoglienza degli ospiti, l'affitto della
strumentazione tecnica, la promozione, etc. </p>
<p>Per continuare a fare tutto ciò abbiamo bisogno di TE! </p>

<p><b>Lampedusa In Festival - Stories of Migrants and Projects of Resistance </b></p>
<p>Once upon a time
there was an island of just 24 square kilometres, resting at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. One day, the Minister of the
Interior  of the Italian Government decided
that a detention centre for migrants was not enough, and proposed to build a
second one. The local population rise up and from the ashes of that revolt  two ambitious projects of creative resistance
born: the Askavusa Collective and the Lampedusa In Festival. This is more or
less the story that is told from then on winter nights, when out, the Mistral,
blows strongly. </p>
<p>The Lampedusa In
Festival, now in its sixth edition, wants to continue to address topics such as
migration, civil liberties and the effects of globalisation on society, through
open debates and forms of art such as cinema, theatre, music, literature, etc..
To ensure the ideological and political independence of the event, and
therefore a high level of complaint, over the years we have chose to use, more
and more, forms of financing from the bottom. So we come to the present day and
why we are here.  </p>
<p><b>About Us </b></p>
<p>Askavusa is a
Collective born in March 2009
 in Lampedusa, after protests against the creation of a
second detention centre for migrants. Over the years, the collective committed
itself to organising political and cultural activities as much as promoting the
resources of the territory. At the same time it carried on an intensive
critique about the causes and consequences of migration crossing the Mediterranean. Along with the festival, the collective
has long carried out a work of collection and preservation of objects found on
the boats used by migrants to cross the Sicilian Channel. This meticulous work
has seen its natural outcome in PortoM: a permanent exhibition of the passage
and the stories of thousands of human beings on the island of Lampedusa.
</p>
<p><b>Why to contribute </b></p>
<p>The Lampedusa In
Festival is a cultural event that aims to tell stories too often forgotten,
preserving the memory of the Mediterranean Sea
and all what it represents: a meeting point between worlds near and far. </p>
<p>With your
contribution you will help us to continue this work, to pass on the stories of
the inhabitants of this island and of all those who have reached this shore,
and moved away. To support the festival to retain its independence, we ask you
to finance - even with a small gesture - this project, allowing us to give
voice to both migrants and residents of Lampedusa, a place that everyone talks
about, but no one really wants to listen to. </p>
<p><b>How to contribute </b></p>
<p>Every year the

</div></div>","Lampedusa In festival - Storie di Migranti e Progetti di Resistenza



C'era una volta un isola di
soli 24 Km² che riposava nella parte bassa del Mediterraneo. Un giorno l’allora
Ministro degli Interni del Governo Italiano decise che un centro di detenzione
per migranti non era abbastanza e propose di costruirne un secondo. La
popolazione locale si ribellò e dalle ceneri di quella rivolta nacquero due ambiziosi progetti
di resistenza creativa: l'Associazione Askavusa e il Lampedusa In Festival. Questa
e' piu o meno la storia che da allora si narra nelle notti d'inverno, quando
fuori, il Maestrale soffia forte. 
Il Lampedusa In Festival, giunto
alla sua VI edizione, vuole continuare a trattare argomenti quali
la migrazione, le libertà civili e gli effetti della globalizzazione sulla
società, attraverso dibattiti aperti e forme d'arte quali il cinema, il teatro,
la musica, la letteratura, etc. Per garantire l' indipendenza ideologica e
politica dell'evento, e quindi un alto livello di denuncia, negli anni si è
scelto di utilizzare, sempre di più, forme di finanziamento dal basso. Così arriviamo ai giorni nostri e al perchè ci troviamo qui.
Chi siamo 
Askavusa é un collettivo nato
nel Marzo del 2009 a
Lampedusa, dopo le proteste contro la creazione di un secondo centro
detentivo per migranti. Nel corso degli anni, il collettivo si é impegnato
sul territorio organizzando attivita' politico-culturali e per la
promozione del territorio. Allo stesso tempo ha portato avanti un intenso lavoro di denuncia circa cause e conseguenze dei fenomeni migratori che attraversano il
Mediterraneo. Assieme al festival, il collettivo ha da tempo portato
avanti un lavoro di raccolta e conservazione di oggetti rinvenuti sui
barconi usati dai migranti per attraversare lo stretto di Sicilia, e che a
Lampedusa sono arrivati. Questo ha dato vita a PortoM: un
esposizione permanente del passaggio e delle storie di migliaia di esseri umani sull'isola
di Lampedusa. 
Perche'
Contribuire
Il Lampedusa in Festival e'
un evento culturale che vuole raccontare storie troppo spesso dimenticate, conservando
la memoria del Mar Mediterraneo e di tutto quello che rappresenta: punto
d'incontro e di rottura tra mondi vicini e lontani.
Col tuo contributo potrai
aiutarci a portare avanti questo lavoro, a tramandare le vicende degli abitanti
di questa piccola isola e di tutti quelli che qua sono passati e passeranno.
Per supportare la nostra indipendenza  vi chiediamo di finanziare - anche
con un piccolo gesto - questo progetto, permettendoci di dare voce sia ai
migranti che agli abitanti di Lampedusa, luogo di cui tutti parlano ma che
nessuno ascolta.
Come
contribuire 
Ogni anno il festival viene ideato e realizzato grazie all'impegno del
collettivo Askavusa e all’aiuto di amici ed attivisti. Ci sono però costi che
non possono essere evitati, come l'accoglienza degli ospiti, l'affitto della
strumentazione tecnica, la promozione, etc. 
Per continuare a fare tutto ciò abbiamo bisogno di TE! 
Il tuo contributo verrà utilizzato per coprire le seguenti spese:
2000 euro: trasporti per gli ospiti ed alloggi
1500
euro: affitto service ed altra strumentazione tecnica

<b>Helping teams to be successful</b> – the success of the teams that compete in this prize are critical to our overall success. Your contribution will help create an environment for teams to be successful, including infrastructure, events, development resources, and more. With the Open Source nature of this prize, this is particularly important as teams have an incredible opportunity to collaborate around common problems.</li>
<li>
<b>Creating a global community</b> – beyond the teams that are participating, we are growing a global community at XPRIZE to solve the grand challenges of our time. Your contribution will help create this community by providing tools, merchandise, materials, community events, collaboration facilities, and more.

<li>
<b>Creating an Open Source educational technology</b> – the winning team and the four runner-ups will all have their technology fully Open Sourced.

Your contribution will be an investment in open education, as well as ensuring that the technology can live and grow when the prize concludes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, your money will NOT be used in the following areas:</p>

<p><b>Why are you doing this?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This Indiegogo campaign is designed to further enhance the community, team collaboration, practical field-trials and testing, and other areas that are part of the <i>Global Learning XPRIZE</i>. We believe the power is in our community, but not just in the teams who create the technology to win the prize, but many other people who want to play a role in solving this grand challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Crowdfunding is a great way in which the general public can help contribute towards making the <i>Global Learning XPRIZE</i> as successful as it can be both in terms of raising resources as well as raising awareness. We believe that everybody, from our backers on this campaign, to teams, to members of our new community, can make a real difference.</span></p>
<p><b>Why the <strike>$500,000</strike> $750,000 figure?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">After breaking down the costs of the many moving parts associated with deploying, testing, and tracking this technology as well as with establishing a global, Open Source community, infrastructure, and platform for the winning solution, our team determined that this money will cover many of these initial costs.  </span></p>
<p>This is really just the first step. The more we raise, the more we can do – let’s raise 10x that this amount so we can further facilitate success of this the Global Learning XPRIZE. Help us spread the word!</p>
<p><b>How do we know this XPRIZE will be successful?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As with every XPRIZE, the prize design team has consulted with a global team of experts in structuring the requirements for how the prize operates. This process takes into account the growth of technology, where we expect technology to be in the next five years, the extent of the problem (e.g. how many kids can’t read, write, and perform arithmetic today), and how attractive this would be to prospective teams.</span></p>
<p>With these exhaustive considerations accounted for, we are very confident that the Global Learning XPRIZE is going to net incredible results. If we didn't have confidence in this, we wouldn't launch this XPRIZE in the first place.</p>
<p>Also, be sure to take a look at the history of XPRIZE. We incentivized the commercial space-flight industry, revolutionized oil cleanup technology, and are on the verge of putting affordable healthcare in the palm of your hand. All of the lessons learned from previous XPRIZE competitions and how they operate will benefit this, our newest, grandest prize.</p>
<p><b>How much money from the crowdfunding actually goes to the prize?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">With the exception of the Indiegogo/FirstGiving fees, every dollar goes towards the campaign.</span></p>
<p><b>What payment methods do you accept?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We accept major credit cards.</span></p>
<p><b>Can I donate from outside the USA?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Absolutely!</span></p>
<p><b>When will my perk prizes be delivered?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are currently estimating shipping in December 2014.</span></p>

Every dollar that you pledge will go towards supporting the Global Learning XPRIZE to ensure it is as successful and impactful as possible. Here’s how your money will and won’t be used.

The money will be used in four primary areas:


Wider testing with more kids in more towns and villages – we want to ensure the software created by teams gets as much testing and feedback in the field as possible. Your contribution will fund the equipment, infrastructure, and transport to test the finalists with more kids in more towns and villages.

Helping teams to be successful – the success of the teams that compete in this prize are critical to our overall success. Your contribution will help create an environment for teams to be successful, including infrastructure, events, development resources, and more. With the Open Source nature of this prize, this is particularly important as teams have an incredible opportunity to collaborate around common problems.

Creating a global community – beyond the teams that are participating, we are growing a global community at XPRIZE to solve the grand challenges of our time. Your contribution will help create this community by providing tools, merchandise, materials, community events, collaboration facilities, and more. You can already see the beginning of this community forming at http://forum.xprize.org - come and join us!

Creating an Open Source educational technology – the winning team and the four runner-ups will all have their technology fully Open Sourced. This will create a remarkable educational foundation available to everyone and one that can grow and evolve long past the conclusion of the Global Learning XPRIZE. Your contribution will be an investment in open education, as well as ensuring that the technology can live and grow when the prize concludes.

Importantly, your money will NOT be used in the following areas:

The prize purse.
XPRIZE staff salaries and offices.
Funding teams to do their work.
Fundraising activities and events.

If you have any further questions or queries about how the money is spent, feel free to share your questions on http://forum.xprize.org.

XPRIZE is an innovation engine. A facilitator of exponential change. A catalyst for the benefit of humanity.
We believe in the power of competition. That it’s part of our DNA. Of humanity itself. That tapping into that indomitable spirit of competition brings about breakthroughs and solutions that once seemed unimaginable. Impossible. We believe that challenges must be audacious, but achievable, tied to objective, measurable goals. And understandable by all.


We believe that solutions can come from anyone, anywhere and that some of the greatest minds of our time remain untapped, ready to be engaged by a world that is in desperate need of help. Solutions. Change. And radical breakthroughs for the benefit humanity.

We’ve already facilitated oil recovery cleanup at quadruple the standard rate. Enabled the creation of a 102.5 MPGe energy-efficient car. We helped launch a $2 billion private space industry. Soon you will have healthcare in the palm of your hand.

Why are you doing this?This Indiegogo campaign is designed to further enhance the community, team collaboration, practical field-trials and testing, and other areas that are part of the Global Learning XPRIZE. We believe the power is in our community, but not just in the teams who create the technology to win the prize, but many other people who want to play a role in solving this grand challenge.
Crowdfunding is a great way in which the general public can help contribute towards making the Global Learning XPRIZE as successful as it can be both in terms of raising resources as well as raising awareness. We believe that everybody, from our backers on this campaign, to teams, to members of our new community, can make a real difference.
Why the $500,000 $750,000 figure?After breaking down the costs of the many moving parts associated with deploying, testing, and tracking this technology as well as with establishing a global, Open Source community, infrastructure, and platform for the winning solution, our team determined that this money will cover many of these initial costs.  
This is really just the first step. The more we raise, the more we can do – let’s raise 10x that this amount so we can further facilitate success of this the Global Learning XPRIZE. Help us spread the word!
How do we know this XPRIZE will be successful?As with every XPRIZE, the prize design team has consulted with a global team of experts in structuring the requirements for how the prize operates. This process takes into account the growth of technology, where we expect technology to be in the next five years, the extent of the problem (e.g. how many kids can’t read, write, and perform arithmetic today), and how attractive this would be to prospective teams.
With these exhaustive considerations accounted for, we are very confident that the Global Learning XPRIZE is going to net incredible results. If we didn't have confidence in this, we wouldn't launch this XPRIZE in the first place.
Also, be sure to take a look at the history of XPRIZE. We incentivized the commercial space-flight industry, revolutionized oil cleanup technology, and are on the verge of putting affordable healthcare in the palm of your hand. All of the lessons learned from previous XPRIZE competitions and how they operate will benefit this, our newest, grandest prize.
How much money from the crowdfunding actually goes to the prize?With the exception of the Indiegogo/FirstGiving fees, every dollar goes towards the campaign.
What payment methods do you accept?We accept major credit cards.
Can I donate from outside the USA?Absolutely!
When will my perk prizes be delivered?We are currently estimating shipping in December 2014.
I love what you are doing! How can I help?Great question! Go and see the 10 ways in which you can help, all listed above. Also be sure to come and join the community at http://forum.xprize.org and find out more.
Is shipping included in the perks?Yes.
Can I write-off my contribution with my taxes?Yes.
I am a celebrity or public figure and would like to endorse the prize or help in some other way. How do I get in touch with you?Please email Jono Bacon, our Sr. Dir. Community who can discuss this further with you.",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>In order to produce a high quality, safe and exclusive lounge, the
project requires $100,000 in start up funds, which will be used as seed money
for the balance of the funding.  Total
overall cost of this important project is $350,000.</p>
<ul>
<li>First step is the
     construction.  A long bar that will
     sit 20, full bar back wall to feature the premium spirits, 40 foot wide
     wall of bookshelves with inlaid fireplaces, raised stage and well laid out
     kitchen.  Next is the equipment and
     stock – providing delicious, healthy, locally sourced foods/meals that are never deep fried
     or bought frozen in bulk requires top of the line equipment.</li>
<li>By sponsoring $1500 or more,
     you automatically become a Card Carrying V.I.P. member, with renewal extended to July 2016.  The Luxe
     Library will be open to the public evenings and weekends, but only V.I.P.’s can access and sign in guests during the work days (12:00 – 5:00),
     as well the V.I.P.’s are the only patrons able to make reservations and
     will receive exclusive deals and event invitations.  Be a part of this amazing group!</li>
<li>Understanding that while
     this opportunity is exciting and unique, the total goal may not be
     acquired through our crowdfunding campaign – Christina Geddes will also be
     meeting with private investors, finance companies and government agencies
     to ensure no detail is put aside due to lack of funds.</li>
</ul><p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Unsure a lounge like The Luxe Library will work in Timmins?</p>
<ul>
<li>According to marketing surveys over the last few years, the number
     of folks who feel this is a place they would gladly support a few times a
     month if not more often matched the statistical percentage of our
     community who is influential, employed and currently spending money out of
     town. A resounding number of comments left were demanding a great new lounge with great service and safe location was needed.</li>
<li>This project is a work of
     passion for Christina Geddes – Timmins born, Christina has
     worked in many careers in Timmins, always coming back to hospitality.  Her fundraisers and themed events have
     garnered her much respect.  Examples
     are – Dedicated Divas fund raising events (wine tasting, comedy show,
     blues concerts); Rotary Club events (Ribfest bar tent, Club appreciation
     evening, Lobsterfest); Northern College Pub events (Apprentice Party
     Planner, Awesome Ladies Club Evening); and events partnered between The
     Fishbowl and Luxe Entertainment (Scotch Tasting, Gypsy Night, Mardi Gras,
     Piano Lounge). All of these events were successful and well attended.</li>
<li>With in-house
     security/hosts, amazing servers, passionate chefs and local musicians,
     this is the place you will want to wind down, celebrate and cement
     business deals.</li>

<p>Unicorns and Fairies may be a myth, as is guaranteed success of a new,
unique business in a small northern town that has typically only supported meat
and potato restaurants and beer and wings bars in the past. 
The solid confidence that The Luxe Library will succeed is based on six
years of market research, trial and error and community feedback. Combined with a determination, drive and focus, the right people involved that can make this work and a solid strategy we are confident this can be THE place everyone will continuously support.  To keep people walking through the doors, the
business plan includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Six months of planned
     events, booked musicians and seasonally themed foods.</li>
<li>Consistent experience – from
     the greeting to the basic menu, you will learn that you can expect the

Empowering families  Collaborating with clinicians and researches  Urging NICUs to implement best practices, known to reduce fragile infants' risk of developing NEC 

  Preemie Parent Alliance (PPA) Membership  The NEC Society has been invited to join the PPA, which represents and supports organizations dedicated to empowering parents of preemies. You can learn more about the Preemie Parent Alliance here.  
We need $500 for a two-year membership in to the PPA.  Membership will allow the NEC Society to reach more families impacted by NEC. We believe that when families are empowered and informed of the risks of NEC, they are in a better position to protect and advocate for their fragile infant.  If we do not raise enough funds for a two-year membership into the PPA, we will use the funds to either fund a one-year membership or to increase fragile infants' access to human milk, which reduces their risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis by nearly 80%. 
If we raise more than $500, all funds will be directly used to reduce fragile infants' risks of developing NEC.  
  PPA Membership: Strengthening the NEC Society 
 By joining the PPA, the NEC Society will:  
Join and network with dozens of organizations focused on supporting parents of preemies  Gain access to thousands of parents of preemies  Receive consultation on professional development 

  Other ways to support the NEC Society  If you cannot support the NEC Society's PPA membership, you can still help!

<p>The $25,000 is needed to expand the school to serve not 5, but
50 young children while maintaining the vision and goals of the school.</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>A portion of the funds will help us secure the building needed
to expand. </p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>A portion will be used to purchase Montessori materials for the
classrooms and furnish each classroom with child-sized chairs, tables and other
classroom furniture from local businesses that support local carpenters. </p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>A portion of the funds will be used to purchase lumber needed to
build a wooden climbing structure, an extension of the roof to provide an
outdoor classroom so the children can work and play outside in inclement
weather, as well as sand for the playground. </p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>A portion of the funds will help set up partnerships and
relationships with local farmers to source food and create farming mentorship
programs for the children and the school. This portion will include purchasing
local fruit trees, berry bushes, vegetables, herbs and bee-attracting flowers
for the MINE garden. </p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>A portion of the funds will go towards the documentation and
codification of the process of setting up an all-natural, organic school for
the purpose of creating a template for other daycares and preschools. </p>
<p>If we don’t reach our campaign goal of $25,000, the money
donated will still go towards the expansion of the school and programs and
initiatives in the order listed above. </p><p><br/></p>

bucket. The narration will be what they decide to tell me about the item when

<p><b>$5000</b> <b>– “Make a MINE Change” + complimentary “MINE
Thanks You…Forever” </b></p><p>A scholarship fund
set up in your name to help build and implement your choice of:</p>
<p><u>MINE’s Nutrition
and Food Program</u> –“The Food and Nutrition Program at MINE emphasizes a
seed-to-table experience which respects children’s capacity for curiosity,
exploration, comprehension, and initiative, as well as honors the innate
investment they have in their own experiences in their lives. Food is an
important part of life, not only for life-sustaining purposes, but also for the
treasures that nurturing life, creating beauty and providing delicious meals
for friends gives. In the age of packaged and processed foods, our children are
denied these treasures. At MINE we celebrate food and all of its marvels.<span>”</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><u>MINE’s Creating
Green Habits Initiatives </u>– “The children and teachers at MINE work together to create a
deep respect for and honor of nature and our relationship with it. Being “Green”
is a HABIT. The experience at MINE for children, teachers, families and
visitors is to participate in the habit being environmentally responsible.<span> These habits are reinforced with an all
organic and vegetarian menu, organic ointments, organic cloth diapers and
linens throughout the school, and the
use of real forks, knives, spoons, and cups, supporting local farms from CSAs
and farmers market, and ordering all
supplies from companies with green initiatives.”</span></p>
<p><u>MINE’s Integrated
Peace-Building Initiatives</u> – “It is important for the development of children’s self-esteem
to know their place in a community, to understand what they offer their
community, and to engage in responsibility to others. Children’s work at MINE
includes peace initiatives, meditation, conflict resolution, multicultural
respect, and human rights as ways to build and integrate peace within their
lives, classroom, and broader communities.”</p>
<p><u>MINE’s Parent
Support Program</u> – Parenting is really wonderful and parenting is really
difficult.  It’s easy to love your
child, easy to find sheer joy in their company, easy to have your heart ache
when they aren’t around. It’s difficult to navigate the massive amount of
scientific research, professional and anecdotal advice, differing and competitive
theories, and unending tidbits of information about how to parent successfully.
Add to that the financial, emotional, social, and familial pressures
surrounding raising young children and a parent can be left feeling
unsupported, overwhelmed, and lost. Parents need support. Parents need help.
Parents need advocates.  MINE is a
resource to help parents in their journey of parenting. MINE offers classes,
groups, individual meetings, and links to community resources for parents and
families. </p>
<p><u>MINE’s Teacher
Support Program</u> – Early childhood educators are notoriously underpaid,
overworked and drastically under-valued in this country. The prevailing
tendency is to consider the first three years of life as developmentally less
important to invest in socially and financially as other ages and stages of
childhood. However, the first three years are when we as humans learn to move
our bodies with intention and communicate effectively with others; we learn the
rules of our world. MINE promotes the worth of the first three years and of the
teachers who spend their days and careers supporting the development of the
young child and the health of their families. </p>

the next level. This campaign will change the lives of local children, parents and families, and will help create a change-agent for the greater culture to re-value the first three years of children's lives, their parent's experiences, the worth of their caregivers, and the significance of their daycare/preschool experience.What we need
The $25,000 is needed to expand the school to serve not 5, but
50 young children while maintaining the vision and goals of the school.
• 
A portion of the funds will help us secure the building needed
to expand. 
• 
A portion will be used to purchase Montessori materials for the
classrooms and furnish each classroom with child-sized chairs, tables and other
classroom furniture from local businesses that support local carpenters. 
• 
A portion of the funds will be used to purchase lumber needed to
build a wooden climbing structure, an extension of the roof to provide an
outdoor classroom so the children can work and play outside in inclement
weather, as well as sand for the playground. 
• 
A portion of the funds will help set up partnerships and
relationships with local farmers to source food and create farming mentorship
programs for the children and the school. This portion will include purchasing
local fruit trees, berry bushes, vegetables, herbs and bee-attracting flowers
for the MINE garden. 
• 
A portion of the funds will go towards the documentation and
codification of the process of setting up an all-natural, organic school for
the purpose of creating a template for other daycares and preschools. 
If we don’t reach our campaign goal of $25,000, the money
donated will still go towards the expansion of the school and programs and
initiatives in the order listed above. 

What you get!(The exciting perks are described here in detail. To choose them, use the perk links on the right-hand side of your screen)
Montessori Infant Nido Environment offers some unique perks for
your contributions. Our perks reflect the MINE philosophy and mission of
stellar Montessori education infused with an organic seed-to-table experience,
peace-building, and creating green habits curriculum while supporting the local
community. 
Everyone who donates gets a personal
shout out of thanks on the MINE Facebook page!
Additionally, if you wish to remain anonymous and decline any
incentive gift, of course we will honor that. 
$10 – “A Very MINE Thank You”
A hand decorated
thank you card from the MINE students. Each card is an original, designed by
the children using an array of art materials of their choosing. Even the
infants will get involved!  
$25 – “MINE Nature and Narration…LOL!”
A piece of nature
that children collected on our daily nature walks around the neighborhood with
a short narration to you from the child who chose the piece of nature. The
children tend to collect sticks, pine cones, rocks, flowers, plants, dirt, bean
pods, moss, etc. If it catches their interest, they put it in the nature
bucket. The narration will be what they decide to tell me about the item when
asked about why they chose it. The narrations will be humorous, silly, and
usually completely unrelated! No matter what your narration message says, we
promise it will bring a smile to your face and a great conversation piece! 
$40 – “MINE is Isla and Bleu Too!”
An original Isla
the MINE dog and Bleu the MINE cat paw print art piece. Isla and Bleu are dear
members of the MINE classroom. They are loving and affectionate to the children
providing opportunities for developing positive relationships with animals.
Bleu hangs out napping all day in teacher chairs. Isla practices sitting while
the children are around. She loves getting huge cuddles from the children and
often serenades us during meals. Both are featured on the MINE website and in
the various MINE social media outlets. Isla is even in the fundraising video
you just watched!!
$50 – “A MINE Original Nature Flower Pot”
An original MINE
nature flower pot. Each pot is an original, made from a recycled tin can and
decorated with different bits of nature collected by the children on our daily
walks. We use them in the classroom to display fruit and vegetable plants that
we have regrown from scraps or planted from leftover apple or melon seeds from
snacks or meals. They are distinctive and interesting to look at. 
$100 – “At MINE, Difference is
Normal”
MINE’s original
“Difference is Normal Matching Work” and a description of the story of why it
is in the classroom, as well as MINE’s pedagogical reasons for having it in the
classroom. 
$175 – “MINE Montessori Infant Gift
Set”
A 3-piece Infant
Montessori gift set with developmental explanations for each piece written by
an AMS certified Montessori Infant/Toddler teacher. A handmade,
Montessori-inspired, bell on a ribbon mobile, a natural wooden teething ring,
and a mini MINE-inspired nature mobile. These are wonderful for your own young
ones and also make wonderful one-of-a-kind baby shower gifts. 
$250 – “That’s MINE Part of the
Garden”
A fruit tree, berry
bush, patch of herbs, group of bee-attracting flowers, or row of vegetables in
the MINE vegetable garden donated in your name. Your donation area will be
marked with a MINE-inspired garden sign with your name on it.  
$300 – “THE MINE Original Nature

director, and, of course, stories from the children.
$5000 – “Make a MINE Change” + complimentary “MINE
Thanks You…Forever” A scholarship fund
set up in your name to help build and implement your choice of:
MINE’s Nutrition
and Food Program –“The Food and Nutrition Program at MINE emphasizes a
seed-to-table experience which respects children’s capacity for curiosity,
exploration, comprehension, and initiative, as well as honors the innate
investment they have in their own experiences in their lives. Food is an
important part of life, not only for life-sustaining purposes, but also for the
treasures that nurturing life, creating beauty and providing delicious meals
for friends gives. In the age of packaged and processed foods, our children are
denied these treasures. At MINE we celebrate food and all of its marvels.”

MINE’s Creating
Green Habits Initiatives – “The children and teachers at MINE work together to create a
deep respect for and honor of nature and our relationship with it. Being “Green”
is a HABIT. The experience at MINE for children, teachers, families and
visitors is to participate in the habit being environmentally responsible. These habits are reinforced with an all
organic and vegetarian menu, organic ointments, organic cloth diapers and
linens throughout the school, and the
use of real forks, knives, spoons, and cups, supporting local farms from CSAs
and farmers market, and ordering all
supplies from companies with green initiatives.”
MINE’s Integrated
Peace-Building Initiatives – “It is important for the development of children’s self-esteem
to know their place in a community, to understand what they offer their
community, and to engage in responsibility to others. Children’s work at MINE
includes peace initiatives, meditation, conflict resolution, multicultural
respect, and human rights as ways to build and integrate peace within their
lives, classroom, and broader communities.”
MINE’s Parent
Support Program – Parenting is really wonderful and parenting is really
difficult.  It’s easy to love your
child, easy to find sheer joy in their company, easy to have your heart ache
when they aren’t around. It’s difficult to navigate the massive amount of
scientific research, professional and anecdotal advice, differing and competitive
theories, and unending tidbits of information about how to parent successfully.
Add to that the financial, emotional, social, and familial pressures
surrounding raising young children and a parent can be left feeling
unsupported, overwhelmed, and lost. Parents need support. Parents need help.
Parents need advocates.  MINE is a
resource to help parents in their journey of parenting. MINE offers classes,
groups, individual meetings, and links to community resources for parents and
families. 
MINE’s Teacher
Support Program – Early childhood educators are notoriously underpaid,
overworked and drastically under-valued in this country. The prevailing
tendency is to consider the first three years of life as developmentally less
important to invest in socially and financially as other ages and stages of
childhood. However, the first three years are when we as humans learn to move
our bodies with intention and communicate effectively with others; we learn the
rules of our world. MINE promotes the worth of the first three years and of the
teachers who spend their days and careers supporting the development of the
young child and the health of their families.

senior year.  That scared me so badly. I've worked so hard, and come too
far not to be able to finish my degree. Because I have an awesome family,
they were able to help out with loans, but none of us are wealthy, or able to
write checks that would cover this… so, a friend suggested that I try this
approach.
On
top of the financial aid ruckus, I was set to use some of that aid in
conjunction with a scholarship I had won to study abroad this summer because
the scholarship didn’t cover the entire tuition, the plane ticket, or living expenses
while in Rome. (Yes, Rome! Me! I've never been anywhere and this would be an absolute dream come true!) But most importantly, I
still have a year left until I graduate.  I have come too far to give up now. I
hate asking for help, but I am swallowing my pride and humbly
asking… Will you please help me?
PS: That picture is of me presenting an overview of my Honors research (up to this date) in a statewide conference just a couple of weeks ago. I can't wait to teach someday!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>About Let Girls Learn:</b> 
Educating girls is essential to healthy and
thriving communities but, globally, more than 62 million girls are not in
school, and barriers to adolescent girls completing school are particularly
significant. When a girl receives an education, she is more likely to earn a
viable living, raise a healthier family, and improve the quality of life for
herself, her family, and her community. That’s why President
Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama are championing <b><a href=""https://letgirlslearn.peacecorps.gov/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #eb1478;"" target=""_blank"">Let Girls Learn</a></b>, a powerful
government-wide collaboration to expand access to education for girls around
the world.</p><p><b><b>About Peace Corps</b>: </b>The <a href=""http://www.peacecorps.gov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #eb1478;"" target=""_blank""><b>Peace Corps</b></a> sends the best

Today nearly 7,000 Volunteers, work in more than 60 countries across the

Corps' Let Girls Learn program will address barriers to girls'
education by empowering local leaders in communities around the globe to put in
place lasting solutions. Peace Corps Volunteers, who live and work at the
grassroots level, will serve as catalysts of community-led change, but they
need the support of Americans from all walks of life to get involved and make a

About MORE: Critically acclaimed MORE is the only lifestyle publication that celebrates women of style and substance. MORE is the smart, stylish guide for women of influence, sharing the latest on beauty, fashion, health, career, finance, home, travel and culture.

About Let Girls Learn: 
Educating girls is essential to healthy and
thriving communities but, globally, more than 62 million girls are not in
school, and barriers to adolescent girls completing school are particularly
significant. When a girl receives an education, she is more likely to earn a
viable living, raise a healthier family, and improve the quality of life for
herself, her family, and her community. That’s why President
Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama are championing Let Girls Learn, a powerful
government-wide collaboration to expand access to education for girls around
the world.About Peace Corps: The Peace Corps sends the best
and brightest Americans abroad on behalf of the United States to tackle the
most pressing needs of people around the world. 
Today nearly 7,000 Volunteers, work in more than 60 countries across the
globe. The Peace
Corps' Let Girls Learn program will address barriers to girls'
education by empowering local leaders in communities around the globe to put in
place lasting solutions. Peace Corps Volunteers, who live and work at the
grassroots level, will serve as catalysts of community-led change, but they
need the support of Americans from all walks of life to get involved and make a
difference. Money going to the Let Girls Learn Fund directly supports
Volunteer projects and community training
around the globe. Your contribution will reach those in need and make a
positive impact. You can learn more at LetGirlsLearn.PeaceCorps.gov.

Uglavnom poznato kao stolna igračka, Newtonovo njihalo doseglo je novu razinu zabavnog kada se na Znanstvenom pikniku pojavilo u većem obliku od uobičajenog - svi su ga htjeli isprobati, što je dovelo do pitanja ""Čemu služi?"" i učenja o osnovnim zakonima fizike.Štoviše, nakon godine intenzivnog škljocanja loptica na Znanstvenom pikniku, njihalo se poprilično oštetilo te će posljednji puta biti korišteno na događaju u rujnu. Također, zbog nepristupačne cijene, njihalo koje smo do sada koristili na Pikniku redovito smo posuđivali. Sada kada se pripremamo za otvaranje znanstvenog edukativno-zabavnog centra, ovo znači upravo ono o čemu razmišljate - trebamo novo, naše njihalo!Novo njihalo bit će još bolje od onoga koje smo koristili posljednjih godina. Osim što će biti veličine prostorije, čineći ga nemogućim za ne primijetiti i poželjeti istraživati, njegove kugle moći će se ispunjavati različitim materijalima, poput pijeska i vode. Njihalo će također biti sigurnosno prilagođeno za izložbe i demonstracije.Što možemo naučiti uz Newtonovo njihalo?Iako kreirano kao uredska igračka za relaksiranje, njihalo je nazvano prema znanstveniku i matematičaru Isaacu Newtonu. Uređaj demonstrira neke od osnovnih zakona fizike na jednostavan i zabavan način, što ga čini idealnom igračkom za interaktivno učenje o:OČUVANJE ENERGIJE -> Podizanjem i puštanjem kugle na jednom kraju njihala kugla na suprotnom kraju će se, zahvaljujući očuvanju i izmjeni energije, pokrenuti na identičan način, potičući njihovo uzastopno kretanje.OČUVANJE GIBANJA -> Nakon što podignemo i pustimo prvu kuglu, ona se neće samo odbiti od druge u nizu, već će se očuvanjem smjera gibanja kretati u jednom smjeru sve do posljednje lopte u nizu.TRENJE -> Slijed uzastopnog kretanja kugli zaustavit će se zbog trenja u njihovoj unutrašnjosti, koje će pretvaranjem dovoljne količne energije dovesti do zaustavljanja.Zakoni koje krije Newtonovo njihalo mogu, primjerice, objasniti odbijanje lopte o tlo kada igramo košarku ili rukomet! Za svaku akciju postoji jednaka ili suprotna reakcijaIako Newtonovo njihalo nije izumio Isaac Newton, ono uspješno prikazuje treći Newtonov zakon gibanja - za svaku akciju postoji jedna i suprotna reakcija.

More About Lakas
The LAKAS curriculum focuses on the unique needs of young Filipinos living in the urban communities in New York and New Jersey.  The six-week internship program provides a foundation that empowers Filipino youth to be active participants in improving our lives and uplifting our community.  This process integrates 6 key pillars:

Ugat: Pin@y 101, Our Roots

Mulat: Critical Consciousness 
Gabay: Leadership Building Skills
Malaya: Youth Rise Up, Get Free
Kilusan: Our Community in Action
Samahan: Mentorship Collective
 Ugat: Pin@y 101, Our Roots – Workshop Description
Want to learn about our Filipino/Filipino-American heroes and sheroes?  What were our ancestors like before the Spanish and US colonized our land?   Why are there so many Filipinos in the US and around the world?  Why are so many of our people living in poverty in our homeland?  Who are we as Filipinos in the US?  Get a better idea of who we are as a people, our his/herstory and present situation.  Answer all the questions you wanted to know about our Filipino roots, our people.

About Ugnayan
Ugnayan ng Mga Anak ng Bayan (Linking the Children of the Motherland) is a comprehensive grassroots organization of young Filipinos based in New York.  We are dedicated to educating, organizing, and mobilizing our community for our rights and welfare; and challenging institutionalized racism that maintains poverty in the Philippines, drives the massive out-migration of our people and funnels us to fill the US needs for low-wage, service sector jobs.   As a collectively operated organization that aims to strategically build our power from the grassroots, Ugnayan utilizes solid organizing and leadership development tools to engage young Filipinos to work for community empowerment, justice and genuine social change.

<h2>It’s time for kids to get excited about their <strong>Science Notes</strong>! </h2>
<p>Using music to inspire and engage students is not a new idea, but at <strong>LearningThruMusic</strong> we want to bring this idea on-line and into classrooms.  By allowing teachers and homeschoolers to have access to <strong>streaming media, interactive experiences, and engaging material</strong> we hope to provide a spark that will kindle a lifelong interest in Science for young students all over the world.<br/><br/></p>

Our web development team is ready to begin construction on a website that will be interactive, engaging and exciting for students <em>and </em>teachers! We’ll be building a web app from the ground up with a commitment to the highest standards possible. The goal is a web experience that is interactive, entertaining, educational and fun. <br/><br/></p>
<p>This web application will be available across platforms and devices and will be built to take advantage of the growing trend of web capable classrooms using <strong>LCD projectors, interactive whiteboards, laptops and touchscreen tablets.</strong><br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>LearningThruMusic</strong> is dedicated to helping students get engaged in the Science curriculum and helping teachers integrate the Arts into their programming. Our product <strong>Science Notes</strong> is comprised of <strong>45 professionally arranged, studio produced songs that target the elementary school Science curriculum.</strong>  These songs are already <strong>available on iTunes</strong>, and other digital music suppliers, as well as having been played on a variety of children’s <strong>music radio stations</strong> and used in classrooms all over the world.<br/><br/></p>
<p>In addition to catchy tunes that bring Science vocabulary to life, we’ve added over <strong>650 pages of activities</strong> that give teachers a variety of ways to assess student understanding. These pages include <strong>lyrics</strong>, <strong>fill-in-the-blanks</strong> and <strong>multiple choice quizzes</strong>, <strong>word study pages</strong>, <strong>crosswords and word searches</strong>, <strong>Art activities</strong> and high level tasks such as writing and art prompts with scoring guides included.  These accompanying assessments and activities, while curriculum oriented and enriching, are still only the ""stage hands"" for the real star of the show:  <em><strong>the music</strong></em>.<br/><br/></p>

<p><strong>The great part about this project is that we know it works! </strong> There are countless educators across the globe that swear by the inspiring power of music to engage their students. We want to make sure that teachers everywhere have access to <strong>high quality music that is tailored specifically to the curriculum</strong> they need to cover. Music is a great way to introduce important vocabulary and concepts to students that are just learning the English language or those that require some remedial assistance.  <strong>Music inspires</strong> those students that are looking for extra challenges as well as those that are in need of extra support. <br/><br/></p>
<p>Speaking of support, we need your help! You can earn a variety of fun and useful <strong>perks</strong> by helping us fund this exciting project. Even if you can’t donate, you can still help us achieve our goal by spreading the word about <strong>Science Notes</strong>.  Tell the Science and Music teachers at your school about us and let your administration know what we’re up to.  You can send out links to this page via email or social media so other fellow educators and potential funders can see the pitch and find out what we’re all about! If you do donate, leave a comment that might inspire someone else to get behind us as well.  See a perk you like but it’s just out of your price range? Find a colleague that’s also interested and pool your donation funds; we want you to be able to experience everything that <strong>Science Notes</strong> has to offer!<br/><br/></p>
