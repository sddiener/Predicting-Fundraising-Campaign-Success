<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Hey everyone, my name is Chad and I am a husband and father of 3 amazing girls ages 8,5, and 3. They were the inspiration behind me creating Mungi Bands. We have drawers full of the other types of silicone bands but after we purchased them they would wear them maybe once then in the drawer. So I wanted to create a product that was first and foremost FUN and would entice children to play and interact with eachother. Playing, Collecting, and Trading are 3 aspects that we have seen that really make the parents and kids excited about Mungi Bands.</p>

</div><p><b>Short Summary</b></p><div>
</div><p>Hello!  Our names are Michael &amp; Rebecca Clark and Samuel &amp; Katie Whisler!  We are the proud founders of Maple Creek Bed and Breakfast, a B&amp;B soon to be open in Tomball, Texas (right outside Houston).  We just closed on the property last week, and we can't wait to turn it around to open!  Here's a little bit about us and our dream:</p><div>
</div><p>
</p><div>
</div><p>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460154136/IMG_0740_gl6h3b.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 410.25px;height: 547px;cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><div>
</div><ul><li>Michael &amp; Rebecca Clark have been married for 26 years, and have five children (Katie being the oldest).  They've spent most of their married lives in Houston, Texas, except for the first few years where Michael was stationed in San Diego, California for the U.S. Navy.  They both have small business experience, love the Tomball area, and hope to retire on Maple Creek property.</li></ul><div>
</div><ul>
<li>Samuel and Katie Whisler have been married for a year and a half, and Katie Whisler is the oldest child of the Clarks.  Samuel is from San Antonio, Texas, but met Katie in Houston and stayed!  Katie is the one who planted the B&amp;B seed in the family by interning at a Bed &amp; Breakfast near Houston while in college.  </li>
</ul><p>The love of the hospitality industry spread quickly and soon the whole family was involved!  We found the perfect property in a
great area a few months ago.  It's a 5,500 sq. ft. house with five
bedrooms/five bathrooms, and it's located on 5.5 acres with a pond!  It's
practically ready to open, except for one major problem--it's almost completely
empty of furniture.  God financially blessed us to buy this home, but
filling it with furniture is the one thing slowing us down from accepting
guests immediately.  We could eventually have it fully furnished and ready
to open on our own, but with your help, we could reach that goal so much faster
-- and this way, you get to share in the experience with
us! Plus, happy feelings wouldn't be the only thing you'd receive! 
We have a bunch of perks available, letting anyone give and get a
special something in return.  With your help, we could be open by
this summer and we'd forever be grateful for how you helped us get
our B&amp;B dream on its feet!                 </p><div>

We Need &amp; What You Get</b>
</div>
<p>Unfortunately, the bigger the
house—the more stuff it takes to fill it! 
We’re estimating that it’s going to take about $20,000 to furnish this
B&amp;B so that we can open.  Thankfully,
the seller left some items behind so we’re not starting completely from scratch.  They left one bedroom set, couches for the
living room, a pool table, and some decorative pieces.  That leaves us with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four bedrooms worth of furniture –
Estimated Cost $2,000/per room</li>
<li>Four Breakfast Tables with chairs –
Estimated Cost $500/per set</li>
<li>A Washer/Dryer combo – Estimated
Cost $500 each</li>
<li>Linens, such as sheets, towels,
comforters, pillows – Estimated Cost $1,500</li>
<li>Kitchen items such as pans, appliances,
pots, dishes, silverware – Estimated Cost $1,500</li>
<li>Electronic items like TVs, irons,
hair dryers, mini fridges – Estimated Cost $3,000</li>
<li>Fridge/freezer combo for the utility
room – Estimated Cost $1,00</li>
<li>House decorations such as pictures,
lamps, rugs – Estimated Cost $2,000</li>
</ul><div><p>               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460209230/Eating_area_t70xvy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 507.68px;height: 339px;""/></p></div><ul>
</ul>
<p>Every little gift helps, whether it
be $5 to $1,500!  We’re thankful for every
single gift, and we hope our perks make you excited to give!  We know many of you want to help us just out
of the goodness of your hearts, but we don’t want any gift to go unreturned, so

<p>After hearing this story it struck me - if this dual-income, college educated couple can't afford home security, WHAT ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE?!?  This thought sat with me for a number of weeks, until I finally decided to do some research.  Here's what I found:</p><p></p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Adoption of Home Security for homeowners with household incomes above $100K </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">is over 30%, and climbs over 40% for higher income brackets</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Adoption among renters and mid to lower income homeowners is in the low teens</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The rate of break-ins rises steadily with each lower income bracket </span><br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p>It was clear that the industry was failing to provide home security to those who needed it most.  The solution had to be both inexpensive and very easy to use.</p><p>So I assembled a bunch of engineers and we set to work on the problem. The first step was to identify a core set of features that are considered essential to Home Security. The second step was to use technology to make a solution with these basic features as cheap and easy to use as possible.</p><p>With a lot of hard work (and a little sensor and hardware expertise), we were finally able to come up with our patent-pending solution, comprised of our Stick and 1-piece Tag, controlled by a smartphone app.  All designed from the beginning to be as inexpensive and easy to use as possible.</p><p>But something interesting happened along the way.  An intense focus on simplicity produced an industry first, the 1-piece door and window sensor.  What surprised us was the wonderful design flexibility that sprung from this very functional innovation. Form follows function, as they say, and that was certainly the case for us.  Not only do we believe that we have created something practical and useful that will expand the adoption of Home Security, but it looks great too!</p><p><strong></strong></p><h1><strong><strong>TEAM<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/523984/files/20140421193452-Team_Pic_for_IG.jpg?1398134092"" src="""" style=""""/></p></strong></strong></h1><b>Steve Hollis - CEO.</b> Steve started out as an electronics manufacturing engineer.   He is most recently with Amazon in AWS cloud services, and was previously with their Retail Operations group.  In the interim, he was a banker covering communications technologies firms, ranging from early stage startups to large publicly traded companies.

</ol>Note that we are much cheaper than other solutions, with a first year cost under $100, whereas most others are over $200. Korner is taking a different pricing approach which makes it very easy and affordable for someone to get a start with home security.<br/>
</div><b>Are the batteries in the Tags replaceable?</b><div>
<b><br/></b><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Yes. And the CR2450 batteries are widely available in retail outlets everywhere. As part of our patent-pending approach, we carefully manage power consumption during the life of the Tag.  As a result, the tag is designed to last 2 years.  Our App will monitor the batteries and notify you when they need to be replaced.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Which smartphone operating systems will you support?</b></b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Initially we will support iOS and Android.  We will consider other operating systems based on demand.</span></p>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What are the shipping costs?</b><br/><p></p>
<p>Shipping and handling is free for the US and Canada.  Anywhere outside US and Canada will require an additional $25 USD.<br/></p>
<p><b>How big are the Tags?</b></p>
<p>A straight edge of the Tag is 2 3/8"" and it is 5/16"" thick.  They weigh less than half an ounce.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Where do the Tags go on the doors?</b></p>
<p>The Tags should be applied on the top corner of the door, away from the hinges (not above the hinges).  The Tags can go on either side of the door, as long as they are not exposed to the elements.  For external doors, they should be applied to the indoor side of the door, not the outdoor side.</p>
<p><b>Can I add more devices to my previous order or upgrade my package?</b><br/></p>
<p>To upgrade your package, just go to the Support perk and add the difference. We will match up your contributions and get you the right package.</p>
<p>To purchase more devices (such as extra tags or extenders), just go to the Support Perk and add the corresponding contribution.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What if I forgot to add International shipping to my order?</b></p>
<p>Go ahead and click on the Support perk and contribute another $25 USD. If you can, note that your contribution is linked to another order. But regardless, we will connect your contributions prior to delivery and give you credit.</p>
<p><b>Do the Tags come in different colors, or can they be painted?</b></p>
<p>The Tags only come in white currently (although that may change), but they can be painted.  In fact, we have specifically chosen plastics so that they will be receptive to paint.</p>
<p><b>How are the Tags applied to Doors and Windows?</b></p>
<p>There is a reusable adhesive on the back of the Tag.  So all you need to do is stick the Tag on the corner of a door or window, and you're done!  And when you move, just unstick them, put them in your pocket, and then reapply in your new home.  It really <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">is</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">that easy!</span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><strong>Can I name each Tag during setup</strong></b>?</b></b></p>
<p>Yes indeed.  During setup your are given the option to name each Tag, after you have applied them (i.e. Front Door).</p>
<p><b><b><b><strong>What is the range of your product within the home</strong></b>?</b></b></p>
<p>We are currently achieving ranges of 100ft from Stick to Tag, and we are pushing to increase that prior to final delivery.  In addition, we offer a Extender for those who have bigger homes.</p>
<p><b><b>How many Tags can a Stick support?</b></b></p>
<p>The Stick can currently handle at least 25 Tags. </p>
<b>How do the Tags communicate with the Stick?</b><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Tags communicate with Stick wirelessly, using a standardized in-home wireless protocol called Zigbee.  Zigbee is a broadly used wireless protocol.  In fact, it is quite possible that you already have other electronics in your home that use Zigbee.<br/></span></p>
<p><b>Is Korner difficult to install?</b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Not at all!  In fact we don't even like using the word install, because it sounds like too much hard work.  No more guys with tool belts rolling up to your house in a van.  Setup is super simple: plug our Stick in your router or modem and stick our Tags on your doors and windows.  That's it, you're good to go in minutes!</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><b>What if multiple people live in my home?</b></p>
<p>Not a problem, and no additional cost.  You just need to make sure everyone downloads the free App.  Then everyone can arm and disarm the system remotely.</p>
<p><b>How do I arm and disarm the system?</b></p>
<p>That can be done from either the App or our Website.  You can arm and disarm the system whenever you want to, from anywhere that you have smartphone or internet access.  And to make life easier, we will offer a calendar where you tell our system to automatically arm and disarm the system based on your regular schedule, such as when you leave and come home from work.</p>
<p><b>Will pets set off the alarm?</b></p>
<p>No (unless they know how to open doors and windows - which is incredible).  Our system will only notify you if a door or window is opened, so pets inside the house will not set off the alarm.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><b><strong>Will my system interfere with a Neighbor's system</strong></b>?</b></p>
<p>No. At setup our system initiates a pairing process that ensures only your Tags will be allowed to communicate with your Stick.</p>
<p><b><b><strong>Will this product work outside North America</strong></b>?</b></p>
<p>Yes.  This product should work for anyone who has a router or modem for their home internet service and a smartphone.  An Ethernet port is required, which is standard on all home routers and modems that we are aware of.</p>

Our InnovationThe corner-piece of our patent-pending innovation - The Tag.  It uses an combination of sensors that allows a slick one-piece design which, compared to the traditional two-piece sensors, works better, simplifies installation and enables an entirely new design ethos:
Looks better - Our unique design consumes less power, which permits smaller batteries, and a smaller Tag.  And it's one piece, no more fumbling with pairing and aligning.  And its contoured shape blends nicely with the surrounding frame!
Works better - We more effectively discern between vibrations and actual entry, so less false alarms!
Applies more easily - Stick them snugly into the corner of a door or window.  Then pop them off and put them in your pocket when you move!
Smartphone AppOnce an intrusion is detected, two things will happen:
The Stick will let out a piercing screech to ward off the intruder and alert you if you are in your home (i.e. sleeping)
You will instantly receive an alert on your smartphone app that will include two buttons:  one to call the police, the other to forward the alert to your friends, family and neighbors.
 Korner allows the user to pre-populate their app from the contacts in their phone with friends, family and neighbors such that any alerts can be instantly forwarded to the user's community, or Security Circle. This supports an inherently social form of Neighborhood Watch and provides a basic platform for communities to interact.The App allows you to Arm and Disarm the system from anywhere that you have smartphone reception.  In addition, you can set an Arm/Disarm schedule so the system will automatically Arm and Disarm around your regular working hours.The App also monitors the battery life of the Tags, and the App will automatically notify you when the batteries reach critical levels.
How Korner Works
Ease of Use - The Tag sticks neatly into the corner of door or window, while the rounded edge contours nicely with the frame – no more aligning.
Detection - The Tags, once applied to a door or window (or anything else for that matter), will detect motion and wirelessly notify the Stick, which is plugged into a router and communicates with the Internet.
Notification - In the event of an intrusion, an alert will be sent to the user’s App. The user will be provided the option of calling the police and/or forwarding the alert to their Security Circle – a pre-populated list of the user’s family, friends and neighbors.
Alarm - The Stick also emits a piercing tone when an intrusion is detected, which can be disabled from the App.
Arming/Disarming - The system can be armed and disarmed remotely from the App.
Portable - When you move, just pop the Tags off your doors and windows, and re-apply them in your new place.
Control - The system can be controlled from either the App or a computer.
Patent-Pending Technology
Performance - Sensors in the Tags discern actual entry from heavy vibrations, thus reducing false alarms.
Power - Our innovative power management technique supports a 2-year battery life using a small quarter-sized battery (CR2450) that will be replaceable.  The Stick is powered by a standard USB charger.
Unique Design - Our Innovation enables an entirely new design ethos, compressing the old “paired” magnetic sensors into a “1-piece” Tag.
Wireless Protocol - Tag communicates with Stick using industry standard Zigbee

The Workshop (where it all started):

Why Did We Create Korner?The original inspiration for Korner came from a conversation I had with a couple who were considering home security.  They were a dual-income couple, both college educated.  They were renting an apartment and recently had a child.  They had shopped around for home security for some time, and even had someone come to their home and provide them with a quote.  Yet they finally decided not to purchase anything, because all the alternatives cost more than they were willing to pay.
After hearing this story it struck me - if this dual-income, college educated couple can't afford home security, WHAT ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE?!?  This thought sat with me for a number of weeks, until I finally decided to do some research.  Here's what I found:

Adoption of Home Security for homeowners with household incomes above $100K is over 30%, and climbs over 40% for higher income brackets

Adoption among renters and mid to lower income homeowners is in the low teens

The rate of break-ins rises steadily with each lower income bracket 

It was clear that the industry was failing to provide home security to those who needed it most.  The solution had to be both inexpensive and very easy to use.So I assembled a bunch of engineers and we set to work on the problem. The first step was to identify a core set of features that are considered essential to Home Security. The second step was to use technology to make a solution with these basic features as cheap and easy to use as possible.With a lot of hard work (and a little sensor and hardware expertise), we were finally able to come up with our patent-pending solution, comprised of our Stick and 1-piece Tag, controlled by a smartphone app.  All designed from the beginning to be as inexpensive and easy to use as possible.But something interesting happened along the way.  An intense focus on simplicity produced an industry first, the 1-piece door and window sensor.  What surprised us was the wonderful design flexibility that sprung from this very functional innovation. Form follows function, as they say, and that was certainly the case for us.  Not only do we believe that we have created something practical and useful that will expand the adoption of Home Security, but it looks great too!TEAMSteve Hollis - CEO. Steve started out as an electronics manufacturing engineer.   He is most recently with Amazon in AWS cloud services, and was previously with their Retail Operations group.  In the interim, he was a banker covering communications technologies firms, ranging from early stage startups to large publicly traded companies.

We will be constantly monitoring the health of the your system, and notifying you of any potential problems. In addition, features of our App include:
Arms and Disarms system
Ability to manage Tag Setup process
Monitors battery life of Tags
Notifies user of intrusion, allows them to respond with the press of a button by either calling police of forwarding the notice to the user’s Security Circle
Allows the user to pre-populate their app with contacts for friends, family and neighbors (we call this the user’s “Security Circle”), such that any alerts can be instantly forwarded to the user’s personal networks
The Security Circle supports an inherently social form of Neighborhood Watch and ultimately provides a basic platform for communities to interact (similar to NextDoor).
Note that we are much cheaper than other solutions, with a first year cost under $100, whereas most others are over $200. Korner is taking a different pricing approach which makes it very easy and affordable for someone to get a start with home security.
Are the batteries in the Tags replaceable?
Yes. And the CR2450 batteries are widely available in retail outlets everywhere. As part of our patent-pending approach, we carefully manage power consumption during the life of the Tag.  As a result, the tag is designed to last 2 years.  Our App will monitor the batteries and notify you when they need to be replaced.


Which smartphone operating systems will you support?
Initially we will support iOS and Android.  We will consider other operating systems based on demand.
What are the shipping costs?
Shipping and handling is free for the US and Canada.  Anywhere outside US and Canada will require an additional $25 USD.
How big are the Tags?
A straight edge of the Tag is 2 3/8"" and it is 5/16"" thick.  They weigh less than half an ounce.

Where do the Tags go on the doors?
The Tags should be applied on the top corner of the door, away from the hinges (not above the hinges).  The Tags can go on either side of the door, as long as they are not exposed to the elements.  For external doors, they should be applied to the indoor side of the door, not the outdoor side.
Can I add more devices to my previous order or upgrade my package?
To upgrade your package, just go to the Support perk and add the difference. We will match up your contributions and get you the right package.
To purchase more devices (such as extra tags or extenders), just go to the Support Perk and add the corresponding contribution.

What if I forgot to add International shipping to my order?
Go ahead and click on the Support perk and contribute another $25 USD. If you can, note that your contribution is linked to another order. But regardless, we will connect your contributions prior to delivery and give you credit.
Do the Tags come in different colors, or can they be painted?
The Tags only come in white currently (although that may change), but they can be painted.  In fact, we have specifically chosen plastics so that they will be receptive to paint.
How are the Tags applied to Doors and Windows?
There is a reusable adhesive on the back of the Tag.  So all you need to do is stick the Tag on the corner of a door or window, and you're done!  And when you move, just unstick them, put them in your pocket, and then reapply in your new home.  It really is that easy!

Can I name each Tag during setup?
Yes indeed.  During setup your are given the option to name each Tag, after you have applied them (i.e. Front Door).
What is the range of your product within the home?
We are currently achieving ranges of 100ft from Stick to Tag, and we are pushing to increase that prior to final delivery.  In addition, we offer a Extender for those who have bigger homes.
How many Tags can a Stick support?
The Stick can currently handle at least 25 Tags. 
How do the Tags communicate with the Stick?
The Tags communicate with Stick wirelessly, using a standardized in-home wireless protocol called Zigbee.  Zigbee is a broadly used wireless protocol.  In fact, it is quite possible that you already have other electronics in your home that use Zigbee.
Is Korner difficult to install?
Not at all!  In fact we don't even like using the word install, because it sounds like too much hard work.  No more guys with tool belts rolling up to your house in a van.  Setup is super simple: plug our Stick in your router or modem and stick our Tags on your doors and windows.  That's it, you're good to go in minutes!

What if multiple people live in my home?
Not a problem, and no additional cost.  You just need to make sure everyone downloads the free App.  Then everyone can arm and disarm the system remotely.
How do I arm and disarm the system?
That can be done from either the App or our Website.  You can arm and disarm the system whenever you want to, from anywhere that you have smartphone or internet access.  And to make life easier, we will offer a calendar where you tell our system to automatically arm and disarm the system based on your regular schedule, such as when you leave and come home from work.
Will pets set off the alarm?
No (unless they know how to open doors and windows - which is incredible).  Our system will only notify you if a door or window is opened, so pets inside the house will not set off the alarm.

Will my system interfere with a Neighbor's system?
No. At setup our system initiates a pairing process that ensures only your Tags will be allowed to communicate with your Stick.
Will this product work outside North America?
Yes.  This product should work for anyone who has a router or modem for their home internet service and a smartphone.  An Ethernet port is required, which is standard on all home routers and modems that we are aware of.",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

I dropped my last class to try and handle the mold problem. Since finding mold in my hall closets and recognizing the sheetrock will need to come down, I have realized this project is getting to large for me to handle. 
We hope to raise enough money to we will hire a someone to safely remove the bad sheetrock, clean the mold and treat it to prevent it from coming back. I also hope to raise enough money to have them also hang new wallboard! We would love to have clean air in our house and have a clean comfortable bathroom, it's the only bathroom we have!
If you can't donate money- I totally understand. Please help by asking friends and family if they have time to help and knowledge to help us rebuild or even donate a few dollars.
Since we have allergies and asthma- our health depends on these repairs.
Please spread the word- we need help!
THANK YOU!

 How Does Canvia Work? Canvia is driven by Palacio’s proprietary (patent-pending) ArtSense technology that simulates the behavior of a physical painting or high quality print on a digital screen, whatever the environment.Built-in sensors read ambient visual conditions and this data is used to actively adapt the displayed image. The light-emitting screen therefore appears solely light-reflective, as with physical art, and ensures all images retain a realistic painting or print-like quality (conserving details like texture, color and individual brushstrokes) under any conditions.

We’re building up a network of contributing partners - individual artists and photographers, galleries, museums and colleges - to ensure we offer the best art in the world. Since starting our outreach activities in March, we've partnered with over one hundred professional artists from across the globe and the list is growing every day. We recognize the great effort of creating art and so contributing artists will receive a share of our revenues.If you're an artist and would like to apply to our library, please contact outreach@palacio.life. Device Features & SpecsUsers can schedule their own playlists and upload personal images via the app (iOS or Android), web account, USB or MicroSD. Information about an artwork and artist can be added as an overlay, and the entire artwork can be explored through zoom and repositioning functionality within the app.Voice integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant will be supported, although may not be available with the first firmware/software launch.All works submitted by artists will reside in a closed system, which includes Canvia's secure cloud library, device and app. This will ensure the digital reproductions of artists' work cannot be misappropriated.Canvia’s innovative patent-pending design allows customers to select variable frame/mat board widths, type and color, offering even more options to match your décor and creative preferences. Black, cherry, wood and white frame colors will be available for launch; black as standard and the other colors for an additional cost of $25.If you would like to order an alternative frame color, please email addons@palacio.life with your selection. We will then send an invoice by email.Note that the final mass-produced frame might have slightly different dimensions from the current pre-production prototypes due to manufacturing constraints. We will inform backers of any changes.Hinges at the back allow you to pivot the device and access communication ports for USB and MicroSD uploads while Canvia is still mounted to the wall. Canvia automatically detects the orientation and loads compatible playlists.

VESA mount compatibility affords greater mobility and control.

 
We also have a load of additional features that will be revealed in due course, all geared towards further enhancing the art experience - watch this space!

</div></div>","MAGNETIPS are an innovative set of Gel Pens - each has been combined with super strong Neodymium Magnets to create a pen set with incredible features.

Each pen in our sets will attract one another, allowing you to draw in new and creative ways, and when not used for writing and colouring they will completely transform the way you use pens and the look of your desktop. 
....Very satisfying
 In each pen, we are using two super strong Axially Magnetised Rare-Earth Neodymium Magnets - one of the strongest and most permanent types in existence.
The magnet in the pen lid and the magnet in the pen body are fixed in opposite polarities. This ensures the lid will always be attracted to the pen body. 

Never lose your pen cap again...
On average,  Neodymium magnets will only lose less than 1% of their strength over 10 years. They won't even lose their strength if they are held in repelling or attracting positions with other magnets over long periods of time, So your pens will keep their unique properties for a very long time.
 
Scroll down to find out what makes our pens so different... 
 



 




 The new Magnetips Gel Edition uses the same cheerful colour palette as in our original set. We have carefully chosen 20 vibrant tones which not only look great on paper but also have a strong visual effect when combined together on you desk.

 

  For the new Gel Edition, we will be using a fast-dry water based Gel inks. We have patiently calibrated the tones to match as closely as possible to our existing pallet and the pen body colour.
We have successfully tested a pre-production batch and the feedback from users was absolutely great!

The 0.7 mm stainless steel Rollerball tip provides a smooth writing experience and the gel ink has a great flow which allows for fast, easy and accurate colouring.

 
The refill tip is carefully made to the highest precision. That means that the new pens can be left open for over a week without drying out. 

Fast-dry ink means fewer smears when writing and colouring
 

 MAGNETIPS are constructed from durable ABS plastic and are easily refillable by simply unscrewing the pen body and inserting a new refill. Over their lifetime, we estimated that MAGNETIPS can produce over 60% less waste than normal disposable colouring pen.
 

Easily refillable pen structure
 

We want every desk in the world to look stunning. That's what we had in mind when we first created MAGNETIPS.

 


 With our pens, you can easily transform the look of your desktop in seconds and become more organised.

They will stick together, or to any metallic surface with ease, and can double as a stunning desktop organiser when not used for drawing. 

 

 

 
 


Magnetips can enhance your creativity-you can use them as normal pens for colouring , drawing, writing and doodling, but the real magic happens when they come together thanks to the strong magnets- magnetips will help you create beautiful artwork without the need for any other instruments.




To further enhance the Magnetips experience, we designed them to interact with metallic chrome balls and provide endless possibilities for creative play and fidget that will help you concentrate.
Each of our pens has uniquely design conceived ends which fits the Chrome Balls and enhance the ability for building by adding a super flexible moving joint to your creations. 


 

 


 


 The Balls will attract strongly to the magnets and have a durable Chrome finish which will not easily rust.

The sheath for this sword will come in red.Featured in all of these different publicationsWe have 3 different types of these katana paper cutting knives; The first is a katana that was used near the end of the Edo era by the shogunate police and military force, a sword used by Hijikata Toshizou. Secondly, we have Sakamoto Ryoma's sword who was a hero of the Edo era. Finally, we have the third design, Oda Nobunaga's sword who was a huge figure in the Sengoku era and is known across the world.【Katana Paper Knife Hijikata Toshizou Model ""Izumi no Kami Kenesada""】Hijikata Toshizou; also called the ""Demon of the shogunate"" by his colleagues, had a favourite sword by the name of ""Izumi no Kami Kenesada"", with both the blade itself and the sheath in mind, we have created this product with utmost care and attention to detail. We worked together with the Hijikata Toshizou Museum in Tokyo's Hino City to create a sword that has an uncanny resemblance to the original.Sheath: Wild Boar and PheonixBlade: Hamon Pattern (Sanbonsugi), Izumi no Kami Kenesada Seal (Marking)(Joint-creation alongside the Hijikata Toshizou Museum)(Submitted by the Hijikata Toshizou Museum)【Katana Paper Knife Sakamoto Ryoma Model ""Mutsunokamiyoshiyuki""】Sakamoto Ryoma, a man who after leaving Tosa which was in the Kōchi prefecture, changed Japan's history hugely by forming the Satchō alliance as well as helping with the restoration of the imperial rule. He had a beloved sword called ""Mutsunokamiyoshiyuki"", which, just like all of our katana's, has had great care taken in the attention to detail of both the blade and the sheath. Sheath: Pebbled red accentBlade: Double bladed pattern, Mutsunokamiyoshiyuki seal (Marking)(Sakamoto Ryoma Memorial Museum Offer)【Katana Paper Knife Oda Nobunaga Model ""Heshikiri-Hasebe ""】In the Sengoku period of Japan, when the whole country was devided, Oda Nobunaga, who was known for expanding his territory unresisted, had a beloved sword called ""Heshikiri-Hasebe"", it is this sword and its sheath that we have studied and designed this final model around.The sheath is a 2-tone black and gold. You can almost feel Oda Nobunaga's majesty.Sheath: Black, GoldBlade: Ripple pattern crest, Heshikiri-Hasebe seal (Marking)(C) Suwabara Hiroyuki / Seven Continents<Characteristic 1>These famously known paper knives are created one by one with great detail by edged-tool craftsman, thanks to this, they have a sharpness unrivalled by any other product.These knives with their sharp cutting strength and durability have been ""tempered"" which is a method also used in the creation of Japanese swords.PLEASE NOTE:  DUE TO THE NATURE AND TRAIT OF THE PAPER KNIVES, THE SHARPNESS HAS BEEN SLIGHTLY DULLED IN COMPARISON TO OTHER EDGED TOOLS, WE ASK FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS MATTER. ※ The craftsman sharpening the edges with great skill and precision.Through just owning a single one of these, you will be able to cut open letters and packages at home or at your office with great ease.<Characteristic 2>Thanks to the included stand, by placing the paper-knife on top of your desk, it acts as a great addition to your interior design giving off a cool air to it.For people who really want to own a Japanese sword but always think ""I don't know where to put it!"" or ""I can only put it in a Japanese-styled room!"", by owning one of these paper-knives, you can place this anywhere to enjoy that ""Japanese feel"" whilst also getting the usefulness of the product, there is no doubt this product will be useful in your everyday life.※The mat and backdrop are not included with the product. 【Nail Clipper Oda Nobunaga (Heshikiri-Hasebe) Model】High-quality nail clippers which an edged-blade craftsman has painstakingly created in the image of Oda Nobunaga's beloved sword ""Heshikiri-Hasebe"". Through sliding the lever section, you can see the Oda Family Crest inside of the clippers giving you an even further sense of high-quality and attention-to-detail. These nail clippers are sharper than any you've owned before, allowing you to maintain your nails at a greater precision which you have never experienced before now.【Paper Knife Washitsu (Japanese-style room) set】Use this Washitsu-style room set to show off your paper knife's beauty and elegance.There are 4 different pictures of the 4 seasons in Japan placed into the back of the room allowing you to change them to match the current season.Furthermore, you can even place your family photos, photos of your children, or any other picture you would like allowing you to match the piece to any room in your house.On top of all this, it comes with an LED lamp which you can turn on and off using the switch allowing you to light up the background image beautifully for ambience.Included in the set is a paper knife of your choice, the miniature washitsu room, a horizontal stand for your knife and it's sheath, pictures of the 4 seasons of Japan and 3 AA batteries.When cutting envelopes and such during your everyday life, simply cutting it with your typical paper-knife is boring and has no excitement what-so-ever, using this as our reason, we decided we wanted to make something that was fun to use when even doing a mundane task such as cutting open an envelope.It was then that we thought about the beloved swords that many famous samurais used to have, if we used those, then you would be able to be excited when cutting open things and have a better sense of fulfilment afterwards.Our company has been active in the city of Seki which sits within the Gifu Prefecture for over 70 years, creating mainly scissors and paper-knives.We have created various different types such as office scissors, kitchen scissors, industrial scissors, tailor scissors, and many more, through following our customers' wishes, we have released many original products.In more recent years, we have been able to strengthen our brand, and further polish our product quality and design.Q1: Are there any dangers with using these sharp blades?A1: Due to the product being created for use as a paper-knife, it is very good at cutting through papers. If used for its intended purpose there should be no issue of injuries to your finger or hand, however, we ask that you never swing the blade around or use it carelessly.Q2: What materials are being used?A2: We are using stainless steel which is used often on edged tools due to its ability to be tempered. Stainless steel, when compared to iron is very good at not rusting, however, if the product gets wet or is left inside of liquid for long periods of time there are chances of it rusting, so we ask that you take care in those regards. When using the product as a typical paper-knife, there should be no rusting.Q3: Can we use this to cut cardboard boxes also?A3: Due to this product being made for use in cutting paper, we ask that you try to avoid using it to cut thicker materials such as cardboard. There are chances of the blade breaking or bending, so we ask that you try to use it only for its intended purpose of cutting things such as envelopes.Q4: What is the size of the knife?A4: Its entire length is around 21cm, the same as your typical paper-knife.Q5: What is the length of the blade itself?A5: Around 20cm.Through just owning one of our paper-knives, you are able to go about your everyday life in a more fun manner.Furthermore, we believe this product can be used not only as a present for your friends but to your special someone as well.We are praying for your support, and hope that in the future we can release more designs of swords from various famous swordsmen throughout Japanese history.We look forward to hearing your opinions and receiving your support.",25.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<p>I will be spending the rest of the year constructing and modifying a Model A to run on fusion power.</p>
<p>I am a 62 year old retiring physics prof who has been working on “cold fusion” for 24 years. I am ready to stop turning knobs and actually try putting it to the test. I am not getting any younger. Now is time to dream big and “go for it”.<strong> It is bold. It is daring. It is crazy but I have to try.</strong> I have a few “hot” samples and I have a ’28 Model A Ford that I will use for a standalone test of the concept. It will take about $25,000 to get fancy Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries, steam engine, a generator, mechanical and electrical items. I need to raise $20,000 for it.

<p>I will be scaling up an existing experiment involving electric stimulation of a deuterium containing metal lattice system for higher levels of heat. I will be using “Cold Fusion” (also known by its current ""politically correct term"" as LENR) to generate heat to boil water<strong>**</strong> to drive a steam engine<strong> ** </strong>and turn an electric generator. I don’t expect to have enough power to run the car directly but I hope to “trickle charge” some batteries enough to run the car after very long charging times. I am hoping for about 5 Watts of net electrical energy. I am close. The heating should scale with volume/mass and my losses will scale just as surface area. I even have a few samples that have been “self heating”.</p>
<p><strong>It is a long shot. I cannot promise success but I definitely will give it my best effort.</strong> Please spread the word to friends and those you think would be interested.

<h3>Us</h3>
<p>Well, a small startup company creating automation solutions for use with a smartphone. Our main idea is to achieve good results on automation projects with a small budget. We provide a hardware and software solution to trigger multiple electrical devices with a simple smartphone. An example is a garage door, alarm system, lights switch and many more. This campign is important for us to get the project fully running. We want to add support for all modern mobile devices like iPhone, Android(done), Blackberry, Windows Phone. By participating in this campign, you help us make a great innovative product with a market finish which we believe will be part of everyone's life as car/security remotes are nowadays. We strive to achieve a usable solution for advanced automation for projects on limited budget.</p>

</ul><p>This wonderful tiny device makes your life easier, it lets you go out <strong>just with your phone and no keys in your pocket</strong>.</p>
<p>The device works either by using Bluetooth in 15m range, or from anywhere in the world when connected with a Bluetooth/Internet gateway. With it's powerful API, in case you're a developer, you can create a fully functional security system with access control.</p>
<p>The device is designed with the help of experienced security professionals and is compatible with all alarm systems in use today! If used as electric switch, it's powerful relay can trigger electric devices consuming up to 2.5kW of energy!</p>
<h3>Why is it different?</h3>
<p>You may ask yourself, aren't there other solutions? Can I make my own with Arduino, Raspberry PI, etc. Well, here is why our device is different, very different:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small.</li>
<li>Cheap.</li>
<li>Energy saving.</li>
<li>Automotive.</li>
<li>Universal.</li>
</ul><p>Our concept is to have lots of small cheap triggers instead of a single big expensive device for home automation. Those triggers are so small that you can embed them in your lights switch, wall socket, car alarm, house security system. You can automate anything.</p>
<p>The device supports feedback from triggered electric equipment. For example you will <strong>always know from your phone that your security system is armed/disarmed before triggering the switch</strong>. With an ordinary analog remote control, you would just shoot in the dark.</p>
<p>The Clicko device has 4 types of trigger control.</p>
<ul>
<li>ON/OFF - that is the simplest case, used for lamps for example.</li>
<li>Trigger - switch on for a user-defined time and then switch back off, used for opening gates for a limited time.</li>
<li>Toggle - switch on and wait for a user-defined time then report ON state and turn relay OFF. Used for some garage doors.</li>
<li>Pulse Toggle - send short pulse to the relay, wait for a user-defined time, report ON state. This is used for delayed arming of alarm systems.</li>
<li>Feedback - this is used for alarm system that may fail arming because of an opened door, or garage doors that may fail closing due to obstacles. Triggering fails if the feedback is not set and this is reported by the smartphone application. Feedback also captures state changes of the triggered equipment so that it is properly reflected on the smartphone.</li>
</ul><p>All settings are set only once and remembered inside the device's flash memory. After pairing a new phone, it will automatically download those settings.</p>
<h3>Are there any other similar products?</h3>
<p>Yes, but only slightly similar. Take a remote controllable light bulb, for example Apple's HUE light bulb or LIFX light bulb. Those light bulbs can be controlled by the smartphone. But we are different in many ways, the biggest difference is that we control the switch and not each lightbulb separately. You can still use your old light switch and your old light bulbs and only integrate our small remote control module hidden behind the switch. In addition to that the manual switch and the remote control are kept in sync and can work together without limitations. This is cerainly just a small example on the many ways our device can be used.</p>
<h3>Where does the funding go?</h3>
<p>Even if the campign is incomplete, all <strong>claimed items will be shipped on time</strong>. This project will be completed independent from the results of the funding campign. But with your help it will get the market finish sooner and you'll be the first to try this new innovative product.</p>
<p>With the funds we collect we shall cover part of our expenses on the first batch of PCB boards. With the rest, we shall create another board of the same size with Bluetooth 4.0 module compatible with iOS devices and latest Android BLE ready phones and tablets. With BLE we shall add more features like <strong>triggering on presence sensing</strong> and much, much longer battery life of the phone. The more we collect, the sooner we can start with iOS, Windows Phone and Blackberry.</p>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>Except claiming a perk, we shall be really gratefull if you tell your friends and colleagues about us, if you write about us in your blog, if you mention us at both your electronic and real social activities. A simple good word from you is precious for us.</p>
<h3>How does this project help other people?</h3>
<p>When the product is released, it will help small projects on tiny budget to become alive without spending money for expensive equipment for complex automation solutions.</p>

Order at: sonicsoak.com! Thank you all for your support! If your order is still missing, please email us at team@sonicsoak.com! Sonic Soak is a device that aims to revolutionize cleanliness and hygiene in our daily lives by using ultrasonic cleaning technology. Sonic Soak's modulated ultrasonic waves travel through water to clean at a microscopic level.Using ultrasonic technology to clean at the microscopic level, Sonic Soak revolutionizes washing technology and allows you to clean like never before.  The Sonic Soak is the answer to achieving a truly clean wash by cleaning at the source. Clean what the washing machine can’t with ultrasonic technology and see results that would shock even the neatest of freaks. Unlike other crowdfunding campaigns, we've already spent months developing a manufacturing-ready model and only need funding for the initial batch order. Purchase yours today and you won’t need to wait long to get the Sonic Soak in your hands, laundry, and basically anything else that could use a good ultrasonic cleaning.Sonic Soak generates modulated ultrasonic waves that travel through the water to clean at the microscopic level. So you can “wave” goodbye to dirty and say hello to a genuinely clean load of laundry.We can’t wait to get Sonic Soak out to you. We've already invested months of time and money into developing a fully working and production-ready model - and we're ready to get this out to you wherever you are within months after reaching our goal.As a thank you for supporting our campaign, we are offering an exclusive discount only available to backers of this Indiegogo campaign. Once this campaign ends, these prices will no longer be available - get yours now. Sonic Soak is the only device that can clean virtually anything that will fit into a container of water (no ultrasonic floor cleaner yet - but hopefully soon!). But more importantly, Sonic Soak cleans everything better than anything else in your house.Think you don't need it?  Think again.  Many studies have shown that standard washing machines do not kill enough germs and bacteria, turning your laundry into a living, breathing bacterial soup. Over time, this bacterial soup gets into your ""freshly washed"" clothes, dish towels, and face towels - into you and your family's body and food.Studies show that handwashing fruits and vegetables only removes about 75-80% of dirt, chemicals, and pesticides. A recent study showed that that 95% of adolescents ages 8-15 had indications of pesticide exposure, when experts say that even low levels of exposure are associated with serious health risk.Not only that, Sonic Soak cleans fruits you never could before. Don't have the time to individually clean each grape? Can't reach every strawberry pore? Just throw them in with Sonic Soak!When was the last time you cleaned your razor, toothbrush, or powder brush? Because of their direct contact with the human body and lack of maintenance, medical experts say that personal hygiene tools are the single most significant vector of infection and disease in the household.No more pulling out your cleaning toothbrush or sponge and trying to get at every nook and cranny - just drop in baby nipples, bottles, and toys in with a Sonic Soak and let it do all the work!The gentle cleaning from Sonic Soak is perfect for delicates, hand wash only items, and hard-to-clean items that can’t stand the ferocity of the washing machine. Sonic Soak thoroughly cleanses items without causing excess wear and tear that traditional washing machines create through their tumbling mechanism, and is even gentler than traditional hand washing.When traveling, imagine having an unlimited supply of clothing, but just carrying a single bag. This is only made possible by Sonic Soak. Go ahead, soil your best hand-wash only shirt on the first day of your trip. Sonic Soak will come to the rescue. No need to call laundry service - let Sonic Soak do the rest, and you’ll have a brand new shirt in minutes.Does your washing machine clean apples? We didn’t think so. Sonic Soak operates as much more than just a laundry washing alternative. It also expertly cleans fruits, vegetables, accessories like glasses and jewelry, and also works great to wash those pesky, hard-to-clean items like baby bottles, carafes, razors, and the like. Sonic Soak cleans all these and more:For over 2 years, we've spent countless hours working tirelessly to refine Sonic Soak over multiple generations of the product. Since launching our first generation in 2016, we've sold tens of thousands of units and have continually improved the device through customer feedback and production experience. In the past few months alone we’ve worked around the clock to finalize the third and best generation of Sonic Soak for our Indiegogo launch and to ensure that the latest generation of Sonic Soak is fully functional and production ready. And we’ve done it.The reason why we are so confident that we can fulfill our promises is simply because we have done it before. We've already raised over ¥5,600,000 and fulfilled orders for over 12,000 backers in China for the first and second generation versions of Sonic Soak. We decided to launch the first and second generation in China in order to gain valuable experience and feedback necessary to develop the best possible ultrasonic cleaner for the rest of the world. By backing this campaign, you will be among the first in the world to receive the third and best generation of Sonic Soak. With the third generation, we've integrated the best materials and an extra powerful ultrasonic transducer to ensure that you can achieve the best possible clean anytime, anywhere, for everything that needs cleaning.Sonic Soak was established with the goal of becoming a global innovator through the utilization of ultrasonic technology. Our team of engineers, designers, and innovators are focused on creating a new standard that meets the unique laundry challenges of the 21st century. With the right experience and R&D already done, Sonic Soak guarantees innovative, high quality products for their customers.Does it really work?Yes, it really does.

<p>So often, it is the little things that have a lasting impact, especially in times of stress.  For families entering the Ronald McDonald House of the Four States for the first time, it may very well be the welcome rug just inside the doors.  Curt Medlin, owner of The Mark of Excellence: Carpets by Design created this beautiful thirteen foot entry rug to welcome families and visitors, and reassure them that they are in good hands.  So many times this design brings sunshine through storms of life, a rainbow of peace and protection over a family, an emulation of unity and a reminder that they are not alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rug has become worn and frayed after seventeen years of families and staff passing over it, a testament to how many families the House has helped over the years. Families are also frayed and worn after spending hours at the bedside of their sick child. The design brings hope and smiles.  Curt Medlin has pledged to design a new rug for the entryway of the Ronald McDonald House of the Four States, but we need your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW TO HELP </p>
<p>The Mark of Excellence: Carpets by Design will donate all the labor, but we need to raise $3,500 to cover the cost of materials for the rug.  All funds exceeding $3,500 will be donated to the Ronald McDonald House of the Four States.</p>

</p><p>I am a Ronald McDonald House success story. My family stayed in the Ronald McDonald House of the Ozarks in Springfield, Missouri when I was in critical condition at COX hospital.

<p>
</p><p>Since opening in 1998, the House has welcomed over 2,600 unduplicated families who have called it home during one of the most stressful times in their family’s life. </p>

<p> <b>What makes Silvon special?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Antimicrobial Silver: </b>By fusing innovative fibers with natural silver, Silvon prevents the growth of unwanted bacteria directly on the fabric surface.</li>
<li>
<b>Completely Permanent:</b> Similar products wash out or degrade in strength over time. However, because the silver is woven directly into our fabric, it will never wash away.</li>
<li>
<b>Incredibly Soft:</b> We’ve paired our technology with Supima cotton grown right here in the USA. Supima cotton is among the softest, most durable cotton in the world.</li>
<li>
<b>All Natural – No Chemicals:</b> Similar products use harsh chemical treatments to adhere silver particles to fabrics. We use the real thing – 99% pure natural silver.</li>
<li>
<b>Eco-Friendly: </b>With Silvon we find new uses for the materials that naturally exist right in front of us. These advanced textiles also increase the time you can go between launderings. This helps save water and energy on a large scale.</li>
</ul>

Our sheets inhibit 99% of all bacterial growth using advanced silver technology that never washes out.
Why are we laying our fresh faces onto a pillowcase that hasn’t been washed in days?
After just one night of use, your pillowcase and bed sheets can accumulate a horrifying array of bacteria, allergens and fungus. Dermatologists recommend washing your pillowcase every two or three days. But who has time for that?

 
The average adult washes their sheets every 2-3 weeks.
Studies suggest that some men change their sheets just four times a year and women, every two and a half weeks ... Sound about right? Our fabric is engineered to stay fresh, clean and comfortable night after night — regardless of how often you toss them in the washer.
 
 
 What makes Silvon special?


Antimicrobial Silver: By fusing innovative fibers with natural silver, Silvon prevents the growth of unwanted bacteria directly on the fabric surface.

Completely Permanent: Similar products wash out or degrade in strength over time. However, because the silver is woven directly into our fabric, it will never wash away.

Incredibly Soft: We’ve paired our technology with Supima cotton grown right here in the USA. Supima cotton is among the softest, most durable cotton in the world.

All Natural – No Chemicals: Similar products use harsh chemical treatments to adhere silver particles to fabrics. We use the real thing – 99% pure natural silver.

Eco-Friendly: With Silvon we find new uses for the materials that naturally exist right in front of us. These advanced textiles also increase the time you can go between launderings. This helps save water and energy on a large scale.

 
 
Silver, it's natural. 
Silver is naturally oligodynamic – simply put this means that it prevents the growth of bacteria. By fusing our fibers with natural silver, these properties are permanently ingrained in the fabric.
The best part? No harsh chemical ingredients are used in our fabrics—just pure, bacteria-killing silver and cotton.

How It Works:
The Science
Basically, silver carries a positive charge, and bacteria is negative (go figure). The silver is attracted to the bacteria, breaks its cell wall and the bacteria is destroyed before it has a chance to reproduce.

Advanced technology now allows us to weave silver coated fibers directly into our fabric. These silver fibers are proven to prevent bacterial growth on the fabric surface. 
 Does it work?
This technology has been verified by more than a decade of testing at research institutions including Pennsylvania State University and Cornell University. Silvon is tested in accordance with the highest antimicrobial standards (ASTM E2149). Furthermore, Our fabric is put through rigorous wash tests to ensure protection that will last the lifetime of the product.
 
 
Great. But comfy?
Advanced silver fibers and supple Supima cotton come together to create the perfect sleep surface.
A pillowcase isn’t much good if it’s not conducive to an amazing night’s sleep. That’s why we combined our technology with long-staple Supima cotton. One hundred percent of this cotton is grown in the US, and it’s among the most durable, softest cotton in the world.

<p>The antibacterial nature of the GOMI means that it can go wherever your pet takes it! From the yard to the living room and anywhere in between, you don’t need to worry about germs or bacteria.</p>

<p>Our innovative wireless charger gives the GOMI the power it needs for hours of play! Once your pet is done, simply place the ball back on the charger (or train your furry friend to do so!) and it will be quickly ready for more fun in no time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full charging Time: Maximum 4 hours</li>
<li>Activity time: Maximum 16 cycles</li>
<li>1 Cycle is made of 30mins = 5mins Play mode + 25mins Sleep mode</li>
<li>Can move continuously for maximum 80 mins.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the pet touch the GOMI during Sleep mode, the toy will move for 1 minute. This interaction allows your pet to feel like a living animal and play for a long time. If the GOMI moves without sleep mode, the dog will soon get tired. GOMI is Smart!!!</p>
<p>With no charging ports anywhere on the device, your pet remains 100% safe during play.</p>

<p>We chose to raise funds for the GOMI through Kickstarter and crowdfunding for many reasons. One of those is because the manufacturing and production is expensive and we need your help!</p>
<p>Another one is because crowdfunding allows us to hear feedback and ideas DIRECTLY FROM YOU, the customer, which we can use as reference in the final part of the design process.</p>
<p>A third reason is because we are introducing a brand new product into the market. We want to<strong> educate consumers and connect </strong>with early adopters and people who are interested in what we are creating. In order to afford to place a large-scale order with our manufacturer, <strong>we need YOUR help</strong>. Placing a larger order means we are able to get the cost per unit down lower, which allows us to pass that savings on to you.</p>
<p>Our trusted manufacturing partners need a minimum financial commitment from us to get started on a larger manufacturing run. This is why we have set our funding goal to $5000. By hitting this funding goal, we are able to put in a larger order to our manufacturing partners enabling us to serve customer demand. Crowdfunding allows us to design without compromise and run a company we are proud to work for. We owe our existence to our backers, who help us design the most thoughtful carry solutions on the planet. We imagine a world where for-profit companies treat their employees, partners, customers, and communities as peers, and where quality of output is not hindered by the need to squeeze out maximum profit. Your support helps us to realize that goal. Thank you. •We truly believe in Kickstarter as a platform, where like-minded entrepreneurs and early adopters bring together innovative, disruptive, and sophisticated projects to life. We already support a dozen projects from other people on Kickstarter with our own money - <strong>we put our money where our mouth is</strong>.</p>

Did you know that up to 40% of dogs experience anxiety during their lives, almost exclusively from being left alone? That means that every morning that you leave your furry friend at home, they could be suffering until you get back.
Leaving your dog home alone without any interaction or stimulation can lead to a variety of mental, physical and behaviour issues.
Nearly half of all house pets are obese, as they simply lack the regular exercise required to stay fit.



The perfect way to keep your pet mentally and physically active, even when you aren’t home!

Our expertly-designed smart ball allows your pet to play all day long through a variety of preprogrammed activities that stimulate their mind and get them moving!
Featuring AutoStart and AutoStop functions, GOMI continuously moves in irregular patterns through an evolving algorithm. This keeps your pet engaged and their mind stimulated, keeping them physically fit and lessening the possibility of anxiety or depression.
The GOMI comes programmed with 12 different interactions offer something new, exciting and intriguing for your pet no matter how long they play!
When you come back home, the GOMI app will let you know how the pet played with Gomi while you were away. The GOMI app will help you know what your pet is doing while you are away and help you manage it healthier.




GOMI makes your pet exercise even when you are busy or not home, by stimulating his curiosity through autonomous movements.


We are the first. The original. The only interactive smart pet toy on the market today! These smart interactions make sure your pet never gets bored and play for a long time,

When the dog bites the GOMI, GOMI vibrates.
When the dog grab or drop GOMI, it rolls away and escapes by itself.




The GOMI uses FDA-Certified Polycarbonate coating that is strong enough to withstand even the hardest bites from your pet.
The Sustainable Soy Ink ensures that your dog or cat is free from any harmful substances, so they can enjoy the smart ball as much as they want!
The antibacterial nature of the GOMI means that it can go wherever your pet takes it! From the yard to the living room and anywhere in between, you don’t need to worry about germs or bacteria.


The GOMI is designed to be 100% waterproof and easy-to-clean, so you can freshen it up for your pup or kitty in no time!
Once the GOMI gets dirty, simply run it under hot water and it will be clean and ready to roll.


Our innovative wireless charger gives the GOMI the power it needs for hours of play! Once your pet is done, simply place the ball back on the charger (or train your furry friend to do so!) and it will be quickly ready for more fun in no time.

Full charging Time: Maximum 4 hours
Activity time: Maximum 16 cycles
1 Cycle is made of 30mins = 5mins Play mode + 25mins Sleep mode
Can move continuously for maximum 80 mins.

Even if the pet touch the GOMI during Sleep mode, the toy will move for 1 minute. This interaction allows your pet to feel like a living animal and play for a long time. If the GOMI moves without sleep mode, the dog will soon get tired. GOMI is Smart!!!
With no charging ports anywhere on the device, your pet remains 100% safe during play.



Want to make sure your pet gets their needed activity, even while you’re away? 

Just log in to the GOMI App and you receive immediate control of the ball’s movements!
Get the GOMI rolling to catch the eye of your pet, encouraging play to keep them moving.


Want to track your pet’s play habits and activity throughout the day?

Stay Connected Through Bluetooth.
GOMI includes a full mobile app for your smartphone, allowing you to receive real-time data about your pet’s interactions with it.


Nothing is more frustrating for a pet or their owner than losing a toy!
The GOMI app makes it easier than ever to find the ball, as well as control its movement. Plus, the LED lights and movement of the ball let you find it under couches, under beds and anywhere else your pets take it!



We designed GOMI to easily roll around, giving your dogs and cats endless hours of entertainment. From the moment they see the ball rolling, they will instantly be mesmerized at it actives their predatory senses.
With embedded dimples that cause irregular movement, as well as the built-in algorithm that keeps your pets guessing, the GOMI is unlike any pet toy they have ever seen!
It rolls easily and quietly on hard floors, carpets and even lawns, letting your furry friends enjoy play time without disturbing you.



Add a wide range of accessories to make the GOMI exclusive to your pet!
With eye-catching feathers, cute animal bands and colorful covers, you can create a personalized GOMI that your dog or cat will enjoy.







Box

PLUS, we include some accessories such as Skin Bands and a randomly chosen feather to get you started on customizing your ball for your beloved pet!





By creating a Kickstarter campaign, we want to get the GOMI to the market faster, while listening to what YOU have to say about it!

We chose to raise funds for the GOMI through Kickstarter and crowdfunding for many reasons. One of those is because the manufacturing and production is expensive and we need your help!
Another one is because crowdfunding allows us to hear feedback and ideas DIRECTLY FROM YOU, the customer, which we can use as reference in the final part of the design process.
A third reason is because we are introducing a brand new product into the market. We want to educate consumers and connect with early adopters and people who are interested in what we are creating. In order to afford to place a large-scale order with our manufacturer, we need YOUR help. Placing a larger order means we are able to get the cost per unit down lower, which allows us to pass that savings on to you.

Don’t let bad air ruin it. With Wynd Halo and the Wynd Home Purifier, you can monitor—and physically perfect—your environment. Wynd Halo has 10 sensors to monitor allergens, smoke, germs, pollution, and more. It features a new innovation called Air ID which classifies the actual pollutants in the air so that you can take the right course of action. Wynd Halo pairs seamlessly with the Wynd Home Purifier to remove any contaminants from your environment quickly and automatically.
 We take 20,000 breaths every day, but what’s in the air we’re breathing? Wynd Halo can tell you and make it better. Wynd Halo can live anywhere. It houses an internal rechargeable battery, so it can go wherever you go.Wynd Halo monitors the air and gives you a summary of your environment at a glance.Halo shows the state of the air and identifies specific irritants in your environment so that you can take the right course of action.Wynd Halo houses more sensors than any other environmental monitor. It also introduces a new technology called Air ID, which determines the actual composition of your air—from pollen, to pet dander, to smog—so that you can take the right course of action to improve your environment. Wynd Halo fits in anywhere. You can put it in the bedroom, office, or baby’s room—and mount it on the wall using the wall-mount accessory (available as an add-on). Most air quality sensors just measure the general concentration of things (particles or chemicals), but can’t tell you what’s actually there. We think it’s important for you to know whether your air has pollen, forest fire smoke,  or smog from the nearby industrial plant.Over the past two years we’ve developed an innovative technology called Air ID. By combining raw sensor data with contextual data from the cloud, Air ID can tell you what you are actually breathing.In response to issues detected via Air ID, the Wynd app can recommend actions to help you stay healthy.Get recommendations from the Wynd app based on Halo's analysis of your environment (iOS and Android)See surrounding air quality and environmental information for a global network of air quality stations via the Air Bubbles network.In addition, the Wynd app can alert you of any major issues in your environment so that you can quickly react to serious issues.Just let Wynd Halo know what you’re doing, and it’ll optimize your environment for that activity.Halo will launch with 5 customizable optimizations. In each setting, Halo can activate connected devices such as purifiers (including the Wynd Home Purifier), thermostats, humidifiers, and lights. Over time, we’ll be adding more optimizations via software updates.To change temperature, light, and more, Halo works with platforms such as Alexa, Nest, and Apple HomeKit. We designed the Wynd Home Purifier to work seamlessly with Wynd Halo. Wynd Halo monitors the air, and the Wynd Home Purifier cleans it up. The Home Purifier uses Halo data to remove allergens, mold, germs, chemicals, odors, and air pollution from your home.The Wynd Home Purifier achieves rapid cleaning speeds by using 2x the filter surface area of typical purifiers and precision turbine engineering. This design increases airflow while lowering noise—meaning it can clean quickly and quietly.The Wynd Home Purifier isn’t just any air purifier. It’s the most powerful air purifier in its class, able to clean 537 cubic meters of air per hour—or, 1,200 square feet in 30 minutes.* Class is defined as connected (wifi and app-enabled) air purifiers with prices less than $500 USD. The V-Series HEPA filter is designed to clean a broad range of pollutants in your environment, including both particles and gases.The Wynd Home Purifier uses a proprietary HEPA filter that removes particulates and gases, including allergens, mold, germs, toxic odors, air pollution, and more. The Wynd Home Purifier’s filter removes pollutants big and small from the air.In addition, the filter material is embedded with silver to kill germs. In third-party testing, the filter killed 99.97% of staphylococcus aureus (staph) and escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria that was on the material. At its core, Wynd Home Purifier works seamlessly with the Wynd Halo so you shouldn’t need to make any manual adjustments. After pairing with the Halo, the Wynd Home Purifier goes to work when needed to maintain a healthy and clean environment.The Wynd Home Purifier doesn't just operate on full blast all day: It only turns on when needed. With smart scheduling, if you’re not home, the purifier can turn down automatically. It turns up a couple hours before you get home, so that the air's fresh when you return—and it even lowers its volume when you're home, so that you can enjoy a quiet atmosphere. Smart scheduling saves electricity and extends filter life.It can also work with other IOT platforms, like Alexa and Apple HomeKit, to control its cleaning power.    With automatic optimizations and integration with internet connected devices, your Halo and Home Purifier can automatically optimize the air around you for whatever you're doing.We are honored to be working once again on industrial design with Mike Nuttall, the co-founder of the world-famous design firm, IDEO. His focus on making technology products intuitive, elegant, and timeless is core to our philosophy at Wynd, and can be seen in many elements of the Wynd Halo. See below for his narration of the Halo design story. We went through dozens of different designs before finalizing the shape and function of the Wynd HaloWorking on the CAD design of the HaloDesign of the Wynd v2.0 app, which will support both existing Wynd products as well as the Wynd Halo, Wynd Home Purifier, and future products to comeThe Wynd Halo houses 10 unique sensors that provide insights into each facet of your environment. Each sensor is tuned to monitor key health and comfort metrics.When we needed a PM (particulate matter) sensor for our first product in 2015, we realized there wasn’t one available that was right for us—so we got our in-house team of MIT alums to invent one. Since then, we’ve had a lot of time to improve it. The latest version is highly accurate, measures various particle sizes, syncs with the cloud, and automatically recalibrates. Wynd Halo houses a particulate matter (PM) module which classifies particles at a highly granular level. Every second, over 100,000 readings are analyzed.We also improved the laser: The new PM sensor uses a blue laser—which has a finer wavelength—to measure particles as small as 0.1 microns (700x smaller than the diameter of human hair). These particles are key elements of pollution, allergens, dander, and germs.Wynd’s PM module uses a blue laser at 402 nanometers to measure particulates as small as 0.1 microns. Other PM sensors use red lasers which are far less precise.On the hardware, Halo analyzes the measurements from the PM sensor 100,000 times per second to determine the size and fundamentals of various pollutants.The PM module can generate highly detailed particulate models, such as this one—which shows the profile of household dust and dander.In addition to particulate matter, Halo includes a number of other sensors, including volatile organic compound (VOC), temperature, humidity, light, noise, and others—so that you can get the full profile of your environment. Wynd Halo combines measurements from all of its sensors to produce actionable information about your environment.Most pollution sensors measure things in generality. For example, particulate sensors report only report dust concentration and size. We wanted to go deeper and ask the question: What is the actual composition of the air? Is it pollen, dander, smog, or something else?Using a combination of hardware sensors, machine learning algorithms, and cloud data, Wynd Halo can determine the actual composition of pollutants in your air—from plant pollen to traffic pollution. Knowing the composition of what’s in your air is fundamental to taking the right action. The Wynd Home Purifier was specifically designed to maximize airflow. Most purifiers use one filter, but ours uses two: This doubles the air intake area, so that the purifier can output massive amounts of air. Dual filters create super-fast cleaning speeds and significantly lengthen filter life.The purifier houses a powerful turbofan which spins at 987 RPM to clean your space quickly. At max, the Wynd Home Purifier generates 537 cubic meters of air per hour, which is enough to clean a 1,200 square foot space in under 30 minutes.Internals of the Wynd Home Purifier showing the powerful turbofan, capable of spinning at 987 RPM to generate over 537 cubic meters of clean air per hourHere's a quick demo of the Wynd Home Purifier in action:The Wynd Home Purifier cleans a tank full of pollutants in 30 seconds.ADD-ON INSTRUCTIONSYou do not need to choose a different reward tier for your add-ons.NEW BACKERS:

Our products provide a safe and stimulating environment for cats to enjoy their lives and improve their well-being. As pet lovers, enhancing their quality of life is important to us and this was the inspiration behind the creation of Catipilla. Our launch range proved an instant success with Catipilla products now being enjoyed by cats in homes, catios, and catteries within 12 countries. We pride ourselves in producing high-quality, innovative products that improve animal health and well-being by encouraging natural behaviours. We also design products that will last, are great to look at and can be used indoors or out. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551291936/rlqpclseyqi4i2zuoxfe.png"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Indiegogo Campaign</h3><p>Our Indiegogo campaign will enable us to bring a new product to our range. Cat scratching posts offer cats a safe place to clean and sharpen their claws, stretch, and tone muscle; more instinctive behaviours. Many cat owners will know the damage that cats can do to curtains, sofas, and carpets if they don't have somewhere to scratch.</p><p>Catipilla's wall-mounted scratching posts come in 3 different lengths – 75cm, 60cm and 50cm. They are replaceable, 100% recyclable and made from the highest quality materials including 8mm sisal rope and anodised aluminum. We have built and tested numerous prototypes and have UK-based manufacturers lined up to create the tooling and assembly lines required to build the product. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551376305/jvupfkyxwvolecslxu6z.png"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Product Specification &amp; Installation</h3><p>We have designed this module to be as easy to install as possible.

Our products provide a safe and stimulating environment for cats to enjoy their lives and improve their well-being. As pet lovers, enhancing their quality of life is important to us and this was the inspiration behind the creation of Catipilla. Our launch range proved an instant success with Catipilla products now being enjoyed by cats in homes, catios, and catteries within 12 countries. We pride ourselves in producing high-quality, innovative products that improve animal health and well-being by encouraging natural behaviours. We also design products that will last, are great to look at and can be used indoors or out. Indiegogo CampaignOur Indiegogo campaign will enable us to bring a new product to our range. Cat scratching posts offer cats a safe place to clean and sharpen their claws, stretch, and tone muscle; more instinctive behaviours. Many cat owners will know the damage that cats can do to curtains, sofas, and carpets if they don't have somewhere to scratch.Catipilla's wall-mounted scratching posts come in 3 different lengths – 75cm, 60cm and 50cm. They are replaceable, 100% recyclable and made from the highest quality materials including 8mm sisal rope and anodised aluminum. We have built and tested numerous prototypes and have UK-based manufacturers lined up to create the tooling and assembly lines required to build the product. Product Specification & InstallationWe have designed this module to be as easy to install as possible. Using just 4 screws, the scratcher will be up in next to no time. You can then take advantage of the clever design to replace a worn scratching cylinder in 30 seconds flat. All the materials selected for this module have been chosen for their quality, longevity and aesthetic appeal.  

 
 

 
All of this only becomes possible with the support of the Indiegogo community so please help us. We are looking to raise a minimum of £5,000 on Indiegogo and have some unique pre-launch offers for you with discounts of up to 40%. With this funding in place, we will be able to deliver scratchers within 3 months and bring this exciting new product to cat-loving homes. We are committed to honouring all pledges and rewards made by the Indiegogo community.

<p>Years ago, there was only one option if you needed to grind up some herbs: rubbing stones together with your bare hands. Herb grinders have come a long way from that, of course, but if you look around the market, you'll probably sense there's something missing. Taking all the best design concepts and improving on them, we have created Stona to be the premier combo mortar-grinder-grater, <strong>putting extreme grinding power in your hands</strong>. </p>

<p>The innovative, unique design and function stands out and is completely different from most herb grinders on the market. Stona was created to be more than a product of functionality and convenience but a <strong>ritual</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>What's special about Stona?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Perfect for dried herbs and dried flowers</strong>, Stona <strong>slices</strong> instead of shredding, its razor-sharp microblades (more than 900 in total) working together to give you a choice as to just how fine you want the grind to be, changing out either of the two grater plates according to your tastes or needs. Stona comes with two changeable magnetic stainless steel grater plates – one for a fine grind and one for a medium grind.</p>

</div></div>","Years ago, there was only one option if you needed to grind up some herbs: rubbing stones together with your bare hands. Herb grinders have come a long way from that, of course, but if you look around the market, you'll probably sense there's something missing. Taking all the best design concepts and improving on them, we have created Stona to be the premier combo mortar-grinder-grater, putting extreme grinding power in your hands. 
 

 


 
The innovative, unique design and function stands out and is completely different from most herb grinders on the market. Stona was created to be more than a product of functionality and convenience but a ritual.
 

 

What's special about Stona?
Perfect for dried herbs and dried flowers, Stona slices instead of shredding, its razor-sharp microblades (more than 900 in total) working together to give you a choice as to just how fine you want the grind to be, changing out either of the two grater plates according to your tastes or needs. Stona comes with two changeable magnetic stainless steel grater plates – one for a fine grind and one for a medium grind.
 

 
The microblades are situated 30% underneath the upper grating surface, preventing them from slicing anything but your herbs.
 

 

 

 

 

 




 


 


 


Stona comes with two changeable magnetic stainless steel grater plates – one for a fine grind and one for a medium grind – unlike anything else on the market, and its woodcasing is both attractive and efficient. The lid is made from durable space grade anodized aluminum, the storage chamber is air-sealed, and you never need to screw anything together.

 
We produce 95% of our components locally, including wood curated from the Bavarian forest, handcrafted mouth-blown smoked glass - which is uniquely made by traditional glassmakers - and wood parts produced and finished in Germany. In addition, we are using 100% organic linseed oil for the wood finish and ensuring that everything in Stona is sustainable and recyclable. 

 

 



 

You can build your collection of herbs quickly with the Stonitos, storage jars, which are air-sealed and tinted for long-lasting freshness. Each Stonito jar is made from mouth-blown glass and a wooden lid, which pops on and off.
You can add one ore more storage jars as add-ons to your pledge. You will find the add-ons when you go through the check out process.
 

 

 

 

Living and working in Germany, we're passionate about grinding herb. We've worked in the automotive industry, and this project is a labor of love for us, much more fulfilling than any other day job we have ever had. In the living room, in the kitchen, and even out in the Alps, this grinder is something we created to make your life easier – and to make grinding something you can finally get excited about.

<h3>Ultra-Absorbent Premium Microfiber Towels</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553887521/nm2zzxykyzoxqviksad8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>A Cleaning Expert Built A Better Towel</h3>
<p>YouTube sensation and cleaning expert Melissa Maker introduced the world to Maker's Clean microfiber cleaning cloths in 2016 and people lost their minds! Microfiber has revolutionized the cleaning industry, so we thought, why not revolutionize the bath towel industry too?!</p>
<p>Now, we're proud to introduce a full line of premium microfiber bath towels. Featuring our unique waffle weave pattern, <strong>these anti-microbial towels will dry you faster and more efficiently than traditional cotton towels</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554920454/jemcyk20hllytjdnlcsu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Unlike cotton, which just pushes water and debris around, <strong>microfiber's unique construction absorbs and removes liquids at an astonishing rate</strong>—no longer will you feel like you're drying yourself with a wet dog. And, because of microfiber's unique ability to dry unbelievably fast, and <strong>the fact that it is anti-microbial</strong>, we have also effectively eliminated that musty, mildewy, ""towel funk"" smell which develops over time in traditional cotton towels.</p>
<p>With over ten years of professional experience, we know a good towel when we see it, and when we see a great towel, we put our name on it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553879903/jjvxabla85kkj8vggge7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Perfect Multi-Purpose Towel</h3>
<p>Aside from drying quickly, these non-linting, anti-microbial towels are also super compact, folding up at less than half the size of a traditional cotton towel—perfect for going across town or across the country.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551811882/fpyiyu08jang50brefab.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>What Is Microfiber Anyway?</h3>
<p>Microfiber can be hard to understand because everything is so, well, microscopic! To give you an idea, each fiber in <strong>microfiber is three times finer than cotton</strong>, eight times finer than wool, and one hundred times finer than a human hair!</p>
<p>These fibers, made from 80% polyester and 20% polyamide, are woven together to create a yarn, which is then woven into a cloth material that is incredibly absorbent. In fact, they can hold approximately 8 times their weight in water and can dry you up to 10 times faster than traditional cotton towels! </p>
<h3>The Microfiber Difference: Microfiber vs Cotton</h3>
<p>Why does microfiber dry so quickly, and why is it used by cleaning experts everywhere? In short, microfiber is made up of ultra-fine fibers which are then split to produce an ""asterisk"" type of shape. This shape is designed specifically to create maximum absorbency and to pick up microscopic materials like dirt, debris, and water. This is in contrast to traditional cotton towels, whose thick pillar shape just pushes dirt and water around, and doesn't do such a good job at absorbing. In addition to this, microfiber is anti-microbial and the ""asterisk"" shaped fibers also dry incredibly quick.</p>

</div></div>","Ultra-Absorbent Premium Microfiber Towels

A Cleaning Expert Built A Better Towel
YouTube sensation and cleaning expert Melissa Maker introduced the world to Maker's Clean microfiber cleaning cloths in 2016 and people lost their minds! Microfiber has revolutionized the cleaning industry, so we thought, why not revolutionize the bath towel industry too?!
Now, we're proud to introduce a full line of premium microfiber bath towels. Featuring our unique waffle weave pattern, these anti-microbial towels will dry you faster and more efficiently than traditional cotton towels.

Unlike cotton, which just pushes water and debris around, microfiber's unique construction absorbs and removes liquids at an astonishing rate—no longer will you feel like you're drying yourself with a wet dog. And, because of microfiber's unique ability to dry unbelievably fast, and the fact that it is anti-microbial, we have also effectively eliminated that musty, mildewy, ""towel funk"" smell which develops over time in traditional cotton towels.
With over ten years of professional experience, we know a good towel when we see it, and when we see a great towel, we put our name on it.

The Perfect Multi-Purpose Towel
Aside from drying quickly, these non-linting, anti-microbial towels are also super compact, folding up at less than half the size of a traditional cotton towel—perfect for going across town or across the country.


What Is Microfiber Anyway?
Microfiber can be hard to understand because everything is so, well, microscopic! To give you an idea, each fiber in microfiber is three times finer than cotton, eight times finer than wool, and one hundred times finer than a human hair!
These fibers, made from 80% polyester and 20% polyamide, are woven together to create a yarn, which is then woven into a cloth material that is incredibly absorbent. In fact, they can hold approximately 8 times their weight in water and can dry you up to 10 times faster than traditional cotton towels! 
The Microfiber Difference: Microfiber vs Cotton
Why does microfiber dry so quickly, and why is it used by cleaning experts everywhere? In short, microfiber is made up of ultra-fine fibers which are then split to produce an ""asterisk"" type of shape. This shape is designed specifically to create maximum absorbency and to pick up microscopic materials like dirt, debris, and water. This is in contrast to traditional cotton towels, whose thick pillar shape just pushes dirt and water around, and doesn't do such a good job at absorbing. In addition to this, microfiber is anti-microbial and the ""asterisk"" shaped fibers also dry incredibly quick.

<i><b>Matt Dale</b></i> hails from the small town of Sundre, Alberta.  After high school he took a two year Theatre Performance &amp; Creation course at Red Deer College.  He then spent four years performing in several plays in central Alberta, as well  as working as dramaturge and performing in  educational anti-tobacco and body image shows for the Mountain View school board in Alberta. He wrote for and performed in a sketch troupe called BullSkit for three years, performed as 'Joliet' Jake Blues in several onstage revivals of The Blues Brothers, spent a summer guiding interactive tours in the underground tunnels in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and has also spent a lot of time in Alberta writing one act plays and short films. Matt moved to Toronto to specialize in comedy at Humber College's Comedy Writing and Performance program and kept active in the sketch comedy community for two years in the troupe 'The Birch Street Crooners'.  As a huge fan and supporter of the arts, Matt is thrilled to be working on a project that will bring Canada's artists together and unite our creative minds.<br/>

<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">TEXTILES THAT FEEL</span>
</h2><p>LeeLuus are touch controlled. This is possible because of textile sensors that can ""feel"" human touch.</p><p>This is enabled through conductive fabrics, fabrics that can be used to measure changes in electric field. Through measuring these changes, a multitude of inputs can be sensed, for example touch.</p><p>Developing textile sensors and great applications for them is LeeLuu Labs core expertise. We have patent pending for our own unique textile sensor technology. Our goal is to develop even more products based on this new patented tech.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457890697/e1x3shroznjphsrqpd6q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-size: 30px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 38px;background-color: initial;"">IN THE DARK, YOUR IMAGINATION CAN TURN SCARY.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><span>Kids have active imaginations. That’s a wonderful thing, but it can also make night time a bit scary for them sometimes. Fear of darkness affects 8 out of 10 kids and many children don't get enough sleep because of it.

<h2>CO- CREATED WITH 100 KIDS</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><span>We love building and product development! Our first LeeLuus were developed together with over 100 children in the Helsinki area and their families. The kids helped us design both how the LeeLuus look and feel, and how they work. Read more about how we work with kids on <a href=""http://bit.ly/1ZmIROo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Core77</a>.</span></p>
<p>The LeeLuus have also been tested at home with families. The biggest “problem” from those tests was that kids didn’t want to give the LeeLuus back. You can read a <a href=""http://www.puutalobaby.fi/leeluu-kokemuksia-arvonta/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">review</a> from Krista at the Puutalobaby family blog (in Finnish). She tells us her kids immediately fell in love with the LeeLuus.</p>

They can sense your touch and they give children a comforting light when they need it.Each animal is handcrafted and its cover is machine washable making Leeluu designed to last!    LeeLuu Prototypes tested at home.   READ WHAT OTHERS THINK ABOUT OUR CUTE LEELUUS:Read more here: Core77 (En)  |  FastCoDesign (En)   |  mental_floss (En)   |  rakunew (Jp) | Babyology (En) |In addition some great Mum Bloggers have written about LeeLuu:Puutalobaby (Fi) , Lily (Fi), LifeLoveWife (Ger)  A MAGICAL LIGHT EXPERIENCE Children travel through their imagination on their way to sleep. LeeLuu is a companion on that journey, a friend who spreads a comforting light. LeeLuus feel like magic because they are touch-controlled. This is also very practical, children instantly get the light they need, when they need it, without having to get out of bed.The LeeLuus work in the most simple and intuitive way. You can turn them on by squeezing or hugging them. To get the right brightness, gently pat them on the back.Squeeze or hug to switch your LeeLuu onPat its back to adjust brightness DESIGNED TO LASTLeeLuu is designed to stay with your child as they grow. That’s why the LeeLuus are both washable and easily rechargeable. You can remove the fabric cover with a childproof zipper and wash it. The batteries are charged with a standard Micro-USB cable (included in the package), the same as is used for many smart phones. 
TEXTILES THAT FEEL
LeeLuus are touch controlled. This is possible because of textile sensors that can ""feel"" human touch.This is enabled through conductive fabrics, fabrics that can be used to measure changes in electric field. Through measuring these changes, a multitude of inputs can be sensed, for example touch.Developing textile sensors and great applications for them is LeeLuu Labs core expertise. We have patent pending for our own unique textile sensor technology. Our goal is to develop even more products based on this new patented tech. IN THE DARK, YOUR IMAGINATION CAN TURN SCARY. Kids have active imaginations. That’s a wonderful thing, but it can also make night time a bit scary for them sometimes. Fear of darkness affects 8 out of 10 kids and many children don't get enough sleep because of it. Like many parents, our co-founder Emmi Pouta has had this challenge with her own children. Her experience helped us when we created LeeLuu Nightlights.  
WHO IS WORKING ON THIS?
LeeLuu Labs is a startup based in Helsinki, Finland. Our founders are from Finland, Sweden and Germany. We share a strong background in design. Developing products for the real needs of people is at the heart of what we do.

From left to right:
Hanna  Markgren
Is an industrial designer who leads all the work we do with users. She is also the maker of all our beautiful illustrations.
 
Lisa Gerkens
Is an industrial designer who has specialized in products with built-in electronics. She builds the coolest prototypes so we can test out all our products quickly with users.  
Heini Salovuori Is our business developer specialized in customer experience. She’s the one who makes sure all our creative ideas make proper business sense.

Emmi Pouta
Is a textile designer in charge of the textile technology that enables the LeeLuus to be touch-controlled. She has two children who are our very own in-house testers. 

 
 
CO- CREATED WITH 100 KIDS
 
We love building and product development! Our first LeeLuus were developed together with over 100 children in the Helsinki area and their families. The kids helped us design both how the LeeLuus look and feel, and how they work. Read more about how we work with kids on Core77.
The LeeLuus have also been tested at home with families. The biggest “problem” from those tests was that kids didn’t want to give the LeeLuus back. You can read a review from Krista at the Puutalobaby family blog (in Finnish). She tells us her kids immediately fell in love with the LeeLuus.

It is not only an Earth-friendly product but also a trendsetter in the contemporary furniture industry combining modern aesthetics with remarkable durability.Inspired by the award-winning SPYNDI concept, SPYNTEX develops the philosophy further through the development of an affordable yet uniquely innovative product made from 100% recyclable composite materials. Incredible flexibility makes SPYNTEX the ideal solution for everyone – bringing style, design and creativity to any space.SECRET STAR - is a Christmas surprise for our Backers! It is absolutely unique solution with integrated LED lighting inside of the SPYNTEX bar, which helps to create romantic and cosy atmosphere. It is suitable for indoor and outdoor use. You can integrate this shining bar in any part of your piece of furniture and make your SPYNTEX astonishing. Rechargable battery is included.Free app - SPYNTEX simulation gameThe SPYNTEX app is the next generation 3D design simulator for SPYNTEX furniture combining virtual and real product experience into one. It enables users to virtually build original furniture designs as well as discover pre-made models that can be recreated in reality. Developed due to the unique nature of DIY furniture, the SPYNTEX app not only simplifies and speeds up the design process but also connects creative people allowing them to name and share their original designs within the community. Why SPYNTEX is awesome?Versatile and extremely practical, SPYNTEX is the ideal household product created for both indoor and outdoor use. SPYNTEX is affordable, reliable and stylish – making a genuinely unique feature in any space 

 
 How does this work?Easy to create and constructJust take the bars out of the box and start to slide them together according to the manual or better still guided only by your imagination. You can use the free SPYNTEX app for assembly assistance or inspiration. Just take the challenge to create something outstanding and unique by yourself and then share your creation on the platform, inspire others and share the beauty and excitement with the world.It takes just 15 minutes to reach this result So simple a young child can do it! All you have to do is slide one element into another. Each element has 2 different sides. If you want to create a curved shaped surface you slide the elements together with the short sides upon each other, and if you want to create a straight surface you flip one element and slide the long side upon the short side - that's it. You are ready to start creating.AssemblingIs it for your family?Each family has its own reason for buying a new product. Here are the benefits that SPYNTEX can bring to you:Space & Money SaverConsisting of loose elements SPYNTEX, can be assembled into an armchair, chaise longue, partition, stool, piece of sports equipment, kids slide … – the possibilities stretch as far as your imagination. Tired of what you have – no problem, just build something else.EducatorSPYNTEX arouses your imagination and develops creativity. You are free to construct whatever you want, no fear of mistakes, nothing can go wrong! Don’t like the result? Just take it apart and try again. The only correct solution is the one you are happy with. Tinkering with SPYNTEX means enjoying dreaming, sharing ideas and collaborating in order to create something unique, outstanding, exciting and unpredictable. Moreover, it stimulates the development of design and engineering skills while promoting a sense of style and spatial awareness. Most importantly SPYNTEX provides an exciting and never-ending journey of creativity.Entertainer & TrainerThe assembly is so easy and fun that even a child can do it! Whilst it can be an amazing journey of personal creativity, SPYNTEX can also bring families and friends together in developing their own unique environment. While the assembly is a ‘piece of cake’, it still requires you to get up from the couch and do it. Take your SPYNTEX and start your playful workout for body and brain!SPYNTEX is for everyone!Now everyone can design furniture – the only thing you need is SPYNTEX! Creativity is the key that opens many doors in life. It becomes more and more important to stimulate and develop our creativity continuously.SPYNTEX is family friendly and, because of its simple assembly, everyone, including children, can participate in building the set. It fits perfectly into different environments and owners’ moods.SPYNTEX adventure for kidsA meaningful kinesthetic game for children and also fun for adults! Kids build, test constructions, learn to read and follow instructions, count pieces, use logical thinking, train their motor skills, work hard using both brain and body to create a piece of practical art that they can use, enjoy and which can be appreciated by others. It is important for kids to learn that knowledge, creativity, logic and hard work might lead to practical results.The whole process looks and feels like a fun game, but it is not just that! – It’s a dream come true for kids because it can serve as real furniture for adults that kids can freely play with. Kids can easily handle the DIY concept – from now on the only thing they need is SPYNTEX! More about SPYNTEX  Adult and Kids’ versions blend together harmoniously whilst allowing customisable colours and personalised design so all the family can find their ideal solution. We offer a choice of 9 colours that work perfectly together so every family member can pick their own favourite colour.Product development For our product development we are officially using a protected design and co-operating with the team of original idea owners – the SPYNDI creators. The SPYNDI concept gained huge attention and incredible support after the Kickstarter in July but the materials and production methods make it very exclusive and luxurious, which is not affordable for everyone.Wishing to bring the concept to all, we developed this patented design and technology further. The product prototyping process is long and extremely complicated. We went through major steps investigating materials and engineering SPYNTEX but there is still a huge amount of work left on perfecting the product and optimising the manufacture.Idea evolution Time line of project development Our TeamWe are a team of motivated young professionals, who have an unshakeable belief that SPYNTEX is an absolutely great product to bring to the market. We live with a passion for innovation and new product development, we enjoy challenges and live for working. We are the kind of workaholics who are turned on by developing ingenious ideas and sharing them with the world.Why do we need your support?SPYNTEX manufacturing requires a significant investment. In order to be able to manufacture this innovative and unique product at an acceptable cost and bring it to the market for an affordable price, we need to fulfil minimum manufacturing order volumes.Costly supply chain and other costs mean that products usually land on retail shelves at a price far higher that the manufacturing cost. That's why for all our backers we offer SPYNTEX at a manufacturing price and for Early Birds even lower. We guarantee that this will be the best deal you will ever get for a SPYNTEX product. The opportunity will never be repeated.We strongly believe that the SPYNTEX concept deserves to find its place amongst most recognised and innovative design brands and concepts. We invite you to become a part of this tremendously challenging and exciting journey, to become part of this design and engineering revolution.International BackersWe are re proud to have SPYNTEX fans all over the world.

</tbody></table><br/>Each vehicle uses (2) PSD file textures. These textures are a base 512 X 512 texture for the entire car body and accessories. The second texture is a 256 X 256 texture for the wheel/rim.

It uses a Color Overlay layer style to ""color"" that layer. <br/><br/>The 3d Models are delivered in (3) formats. Maya .MB file format, FBX file format and .OBJ file format. These formats will allow for easy import into any game engine that accepts OBJ or FBX. I also have a Unity package file for the full (16) car pack. If you order a smaller pack, and want a Unity package file vs. all of the source files, just let me know in a message and I will bundle your Unity package file alongside the source files you request. If you're a Unity user, these vehicles also come with a Mobile Car Reflection shader that uses a single 256 X 256 reflection texture (not a cubemap) that produces the reflections seen in the images below.<br/><br/>Your own game projects will use a specific scale set for your game. I've used real world meters and use an FBX import scale of 1.0 in Unity.

<h3>Lisa’z One-of-a-Kind Magnetic Vase and AquaGemz</h3>
<p>Lisa’s magnetic vase is a simple, beautiful concept designed by Lisa.  The vase captures life’s events throughout the year that are special to all of us.  When you think about all the events that we buy flowers for, it's the perfect gift for any occasion. </p>
<p>Simply change the round metal sayings of <strong>CELEBRATE, JOY, HOPE, LOVE, FAMILY, AND BELIEVE</strong> to celebrate Birthdays, Anniversaries, Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, Weddings, Graduations, Christmas, or everyday!</p>
<p>In addition to the vase, we’ve also included 8 tubes of aquagemz to dazzle any centerpiece. Our aquagemz are UNIQUE from others, since we’ve custom designed colorful gemz all in one tube, have swirl gemz that look like marbles, and have included a few of the top selling solid colors, all in one convenient box.</p>
<p>One tube of tiny gemz will grow to fill the vase, and will add color and fun for any occasion.</p>

<h2>  Includes the Following</h2>
<div class=""content"">
<ul>
<li>1 magnetic vase</li>
<li>6 interchangeable sayings of Joy, Celebrate, Hope, Family, Love, and Believe to celebrate any occasion</li>
<li>8 tubes of AquaGemz to make 8 different arrangements – 3 colorful Lisa'z pre-mixtures, 2 swirl Gemz, and 3 solid colors (one tube will fill the vase once)</li>
<li>1 imitation flower</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>The idea for the magnetic vase was born after Lisa sold the aquagemz successfully at local trade shows, and knew she had something special.  Lisa is formerly a corporate buyer of 10 years who imported and developed products.</p>
<p>She traveled to gift and trade shows all over the country looking for new innovative products that would sell well.  Lisa can recognize when something has potential, and then a vision falls into place. From her buying experience, she also has the knowledge to know what people are looking for in a product.  They want uniqueness, style, value and convenience all in one.</p>
<p>Lisa’s product captures all of these characteristics. Since she had great success selling the aquagemz, she was trying to think of a product that would complement the gemz.  When passion and creativity come together, an idea can strike at anytime, and the magnetic vase idea entered her mind at 3AM!  Once a great idea enters Lisa’s mind, it takes on a new life of its own, and the time/energy/and passion that is put into it is 24/7.  She then contacted an importer from her past buying days, and began building her team she has today.</p>
<p>Lisa wanted to capture not only a unique product, but one that brought a special feeling to those who purchased it.  She’s been working on this project for over a year, with a few setbacks in design and development, but now with your purchase, her team is ready to market and distribute the product. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Lisa'z Vision</strong></h2>
<p>I believe crowd funding is perfectly aligned with my vision for Lisa'z Originals. What better format for sharing ideas, finding inspiraton and creating connections?  Together we can begin our journey of connecting with others and sharing my products and ideas to insire and create homes of inspiration.</p>
<p>I am not trying to be corporate America.  I want to create a different company, a more personal company that truly connects with my customers and followers.  Most important, I want my customers to share in my ideas and be a part of all that I do and create.  I beleive that crowd funding can make that happen.  By initiating a grassroots campaign, I can stay true to my vision and my passion, and I can create a company that exists to make a positive difference in the lives of those who have helped me on my journey.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in Lisa'z Originals.  If you share my passion and if you believe in the idea of creating a home of inspiration, please help share my message with others.  Together we can change the world one idea, one family, and one home at a time.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One vase… multiple celebrations!</strong> Create many different looks to celebrate special events throughout the entire year, or everyday. Use real or imitation flowers, or anything creative. Let your creative ideas come to life!</p>

<h2>Lisa’z AquaGemz…</h2>
<p>Simply….add water, grow, enjoy!  Start with a tube of tiny gemz, fill Lisa’s vase with water, and after 4-6 hours the aquagemz are ready to enjoy.  They will last for 2 – 3 weeks.  Use real or imitation flowers, or anything creative. Real flowers need water to avoid stem starvation so use 1/2 water to 1/2 beads.</p>
<p>Fragrance may also be added when using imitation flowers or any other objects. Simply add the fragrance to the water, and the aquagemz will absorb the scent.</p>
<p>We’ve custom-designed our color selections to include a mixture of colors all in one tube, swirl gemz (look like marbles) and a few top selling solid colors.  The boxed set comes with 8 different tubes of colors (below) that will make 8 different arrangements.  One tube of gemz will fill the vase once.</p>

Lisa'z Originals creates innovative and inspirational products that generate positive changes for our customers and for the world, by inspiring, sharing new possibilities, and creating real connections.

Lisa’z Originals is owned and operated by Lisa Montgomery.  An entrepreneur focused on developing innovative products for the home, Lisa has a background in corporate buying where she focused on developing and importing products.
Lisa and her team are ready to market and launch her first product which is the perfect gift to give or receive.  A one of a kind magnetic vase with 6 interchangeable sayings designed to capture special life events, uniqueness, convenience, and value all at the same time. Our vision is to have the product in retail stores, but we need to reach our goal of $60,000 to begin the process of making Lisa'z Originals an inspiration for others. In purchasing Lisa'z products, you can be one of the first ones to enjoy them, and your purchase will pay for product, marketing and distribution expenses.
Lisa'z Originals is dedicated to bringing you unique and innovative products now, and in the future. Lisa's team is knowledgeable, driven, and experienced in product development.   











Lisa’z One-of-a-Kind Magnetic Vase and AquaGemz
Lisa’s magnetic vase is a simple, beautiful concept designed by Lisa.  The vase captures life’s events throughout the year that are special to all of us.  When you think about all the events that we buy flowers for, it's the perfect gift for any occasion. 
Simply change the round metal sayings of CELEBRATE, JOY, HOPE, LOVE, FAMILY, AND BELIEVE to celebrate Birthdays, Anniversaries, Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, Weddings, Graduations, Christmas, or everyday!
In addition to the vase, we’ve also included 8 tubes of aquagemz to dazzle any centerpiece. Our aquagemz are UNIQUE from others, since we’ve custom designed colorful gemz all in one tube, have swirl gemz that look like marbles, and have included a few of the top selling solid colors, all in one convenient box.
One tube of tiny gemz will grow to fill the vase, and will add color and fun for any occasion.



Inspirational Design 

 
Classic Design
 
  Includes the Following


1 magnetic vase
6 interchangeable sayings of Joy, Celebrate, Hope, Family, Love, and Believe to celebrate any occasion
8 tubes of AquaGemz to make 8 different arrangements – 3 colorful Lisa'z pre-mixtures, 2 swirl Gemz, and 3 solid colors (one tube will fill the vase once)
1 imitation flower

The Story
The idea for the magnetic vase was born after Lisa sold the aquagemz successfully at local trade shows, and knew she had something special.  Lisa is formerly a corporate buyer of 10 years who imported and developed products.
She traveled to gift and trade shows all over the country looking for new innovative products that would sell well.  Lisa can recognize when something has potential, and then a vision falls into place. From her buying experience, she also has the knowledge to know what people are looking for in a product.  They want uniqueness, style, value and convenience all in one.
Lisa’s product captures all of these characteristics. Since she had great success selling the aquagemz, she was trying to think of a product that would complement the gemz.  When passion and creativity come together, an idea can strike at anytime, and the magnetic vase idea entered her mind at 3AM!  Once a great idea enters Lisa’s mind, it takes on a new life of its own, and the time/energy/and passion that is put into it is 24/7.  She then contacted an importer from her past buying days, and began building her team she has today.
Lisa wanted to capture not only a unique product, but one that brought a special feeling to those who purchased it.  She’s been working on this project for over a year, with a few setbacks in design and development, but now with your purchase, her team is ready to market and distribute the product. 
 
Lisa'z Vision
I believe crowd funding is perfectly aligned with my vision for Lisa'z Originals. What better format for sharing ideas, finding inspiraton and creating connections?  Together we can begin our journey of connecting with others and sharing my products and ideas to insire and create homes of inspiration.
I am not trying to be corporate America.  I want to create a different company, a more personal company that truly connects with my customers and followers.  Most important, I want my customers to share in my ideas and be a part of all that I do and create.  I beleive that crowd funding can make that happen.  By initiating a grassroots campaign, I can stay true to my vision and my passion, and I can create a company that exists to make a positive difference in the lives of those who have helped me on my journey.
Thank you for your interest in Lisa'z Originals.  If you share my passion and if you believe in the idea of creating a home of inspiration, please help share my message with others.  Together we can change the world one idea, one family, and one home at a time.  
 
One vase… multiple celebrations! Create many different looks to celebrate special events throughout the entire year, or everyday. Use real or imitation flowers, or anything creative. Let your creative ideas come to life!

<p><span style=""font-family: Helvetica;"">Back seat buckles are hard for little and big hands to grasp and click into place.  Most aren't made like driver-seat buckles.  If you've driven a car with floppy buckles, you know:  The buckles flop around.  They fall into seat pockets.  And when you add booster seats to the mix, you practically need three hands to buckle up.  We think it should be just as easy to buckle up in the back seat as it is to do in the driver's seat - whether you're 6 years old or 60.</span></p>

Loudoun Times Mirror:  Ashburn Couple Snaps Idea into Place  http://www.loudountimes.com/news/article/ashburn_couple_snaps_idea_into_place
MyBuckleMate:  A sleek, plastic housing that
keeps back seat buckles propped up and easy to reach so you can buckle up one-handed, whether
you’re 6 years old or 60!
 

What is MyBuckleMate?
MyBucklemate locks into
place around floppy back seat buckle bases and keeps them propped up and easy to
reach, so buckling up with one hand is a snap.  It fits around single buckle bases, and two MyBuckleMates
can be installed right next to each other to keep adjacent buckle bases propped
up for easy access.  If you have a car, SUV or truck with back seat buckles that flop around or fall into seat pockets, MyBuckleMate makes buckling up in the back seat as easy as it is to do in the driver's seat.  Rather than dig for your buckle base with one hand and reach for the strap with your other, you can simply pull your seat belt strap across your body and click the buckle into place with just one hand.  Even our 5-year old can do it! 
 


MyBuckleMate benefits



Helps kids buckle up in
the back seat by themselves


Helps adults with
limited mobility and Arthritis


Fits in tight spaces and
between booster seats


Works in vehicles that don’t have rigid buckle bases that stay propped upright on their own


You can fold your car
seats down without removing MyBuckleMate


It won’t interfere with
your vehicle’s buckling mechanism. 
It locks into place around the fabric shaft that anchors the back-seat
buckle base to your vehicle - it doesn’t obstruct the buckle’s release button or where the buckle latchplate clicks into place. 



Why is buckling up in
the back seat so difficult?
Back seat buckles are hard for little and big hands to grasp and click into place.  Most aren't made like driver-seat buckles.  If you've driven a car with floppy buckles, you know:  The buckles flop around.  They fall into seat pockets.  And when you add booster seats to the mix, you practically need three hands to buckle up.  We think it should be just as easy to buckle up in the back seat as it is to do in the driver's seat - whether you're 6 years old or 60.





MyBuckleMate story
One day my husband came home with our three kids and asked, “What’s the deal?  Why can’t they buckle themselves?”  I'd been climbing into the back seats of our cars and in and over our kids and their friends just to help them buckle up for years, and I'd always taken it for granted.  That day, I realized there had to be a way to make floppy buckles easy for kids and adults to use.  That's how MyBuckleMate was conceived.

We started by sketching out our initial design ideas on paper, refined them using CAD freeware, then partnered with a Wisconsin-based product design and plastics manufacturer to build and refine several prototypes.  After vetting and road-testing these with potential customers, we now have a final production model ready to be manufactured in the US and shipped within 8 weeks of the close of our campaign.  MyBuckleMate is patent pending and an original design - nothing like it exists on the market today.

How MyBuckleMate Helps
We all cut corners to save time, but failing to buckle-up for any reason is a mistake.  Especially when we’re driving just a few blocks or we have a car full of kids and we’re running late, we've learned that when it’s easier to buckle-up, we’re more apt to do it and not skip it.  It makes a huge difference for kids:  We believe kids who are able to buckle up easily on their own are more likely to create a habit they’ll carry through their teenage years and beyond.   

Buckling up in the back seat isn't always a hassle, but when you have a carload of passengers, and lots of other tasks at hand, MyBuckleMate is a huge help. Now, when we get in the car, we don’t hear our kids shout, “I can’t buckle!”  Instead, we hear reassuring clicks of them buckling-up themselves and back-seat driver comments like, “Mom, Dad, are you guys buckled yet?”
When we’re driving
really young ones who can’t buckle up alone, MyBuckleMate allows us to click in their buckles with one hand without having to climb into the back seat to help them.  We like being able to keep both feet firmly planted on the ground, and still get on the road safely and on time.  
Perks
As a supporter, you'll receive one or more sets of MyBuckleMates in your choice of three colors: 
Cream, Black and Tan.  Each set will include one pair of
MyBuckleMates to accommodate two back-seat passengers.  Since MyBuckleMate is made of two
identical, symmetrical pieces, you have the option to interchange parts from
different colored sets to create your own two-colored MyBuckleMate (like you
see in the Mix-n-match Combo below).  At the end of our campaign, we will send a survey out to each of our supporters in which they may select the color(s) they want. 
 


Our goal
To get everyone to
buckle up in back seats easily, we need your support.  The $10,000 we hope to raise will help
pay for the cost of our first full production run of MyBuckleMates.
MyBuckleMate is patent
pending and will be manufactured in the US.  That means our design and production costs are substantially
higher than they would be overseas, but we made a conscious decision to go the
made in USA route for many reasons, especially to better control the
quality, production and delivery of each MyBuckleMate.  We are extremely satisfied with our
design/manufacturing partner’s quality, reliability and commitment so far.  Our biggest challenge now is bringing
MyBuckleMate successfully to market.
If you like MyBuckleMate, tell us why!  Like us on Facebook and share this site with anyone who you think may be interested.  We hope to introduce our idea to as many people as possible and we are excited to hear how it works in your cars.
Thanks for helping us get on the road!

  It's simple. Flippr (Patented) has two sides. For your shirts, place your shirt on the torso shaped board, iron, flip,  iron. Sleeves? No problem. The included detail board allows you to iron collars and sleeves. For your pants, place them on the board, clip down the seam, and iron!    But wait, there's more!  The Flippr is so convenient to wheel around so you can practically use it anywhere.

</div>","We're back with the most versatile color changing LED light ropes! Based on real feedback from our original Luminoodle backers, we went back to the drawing board and created two new versions with the most requested features. We're excited to bring the Luminoodle COLOR and Luminoodle BASECAMP to the Kickstarter community!










We launched the original Luminoodle last year right here on Kickstarter. After shipping out over 20,000 Luminoodles, we asked our backers for their feedback on the product design. The results were overwhelmingly positive and our backers gave us some amazing ideas on how to improve the product! We've taken your feedback to heart and have incorporated your ideas into the Luminoodle COLOR and BASECAMP:  





LIST OF NEW FEATURES:





 















 

























The Luminoodle COLOR is five feet of RGB (red,green,blue) LED lights wrapped in a durable, waterproof tube. It is USB powered so it can run from portable batteries or any USB port/charger (optional Lithium 3300 available below). Let your imagination go wild with all the possible ways to brighten up any occasion from camping, to your home, or even the next music festival.

<p>The <strong>IsoBag™</strong> is an organized lunch cooler designed to store your food in a<strong>NEW</strong> convenient way! The front compartment opens up to an area where you can stack your individual food containers. This allows you to keep your food organized and easily accessible. The top compartment is for miscellaneous items like utensils, napkins, protein bars, and much more. The <strong>IsoBag™</strong> also has two zippered side pouches for drinks, fruits, vegetables, and anything else you need to be kept cold. There are also two mesh side pockets available for shaker bottles, or other beverages. The<strong>IsoBag™</strong> comes in a manageable size, with both a top carry handle and a shoulder strap.</p>

<p>The IsoBag™ was created with healthy eating in mind. The main issue with sticking to a healthy diet is the convenience factor. Many times people will avoid packing a lunch because their cooler doesn't keep it cold, its too big to carry, or it does not accomodate enough servings. The IsoBag™ helps you stay organized and prepared while on the go so there are no temptations to stop for ""fast food"". With the organized front compartment with stackable food containers it has never been easier. </p>

<p>The IsoBag™ comes in a 3 Meal and 6 Meal size. The 3 Meal system was designed to hold 3 food containers. The 3 Meal is great for packing a regular lunch, going on short day trips, or for those that do not require more than 3 meals while they are on the go.

It’s also possible to rack from anything; Bucket, Kettle, Carboy, Barrel -- all with just this one tool.</p><h2><b>10 Good Reasons Why You Should Own &amp; Use Our Pro Brewers Siphon</b></h2><p>For starters, it works like a champ. Whether you’re a professional, amateur or beginner, the versatility of application is so simple to use that we’re confident the Pro Brewers Siphon will quickly become the #1 choice of all Home Brewers regardless of experience. </p><p>Made entirely out of stainless steel and silicone, our “Pro Brewers Siphon” eliminates all of the transfer problems that you run into as a brewer, such as bacteria contamination or oxygen leaks that cause oxidation in your batches.</p><h4><b>1. Designed for Durability &amp; Longevity </b></h4><p>Strong enough to last a lifetime, our strong, impact resistant, 100% reusable and 100% recyclable, Pro Brewers Siphon is the best-performing and most practical choice for long-life transferring tools.</p><p>Unlike conventional petroleum-based plastic products that can crack or degrade with repeated use, we’ve eliminated potential leaks, cracks and corrosion that can lead to bacterial contamination. We’ve combined food-grade #304 stainless steel and silicone to keep deterioration from happening. It has a superior strength-to-weight ratio compared to other grades of conventional plastics, or compostable PLA plastic.</p><h4><b>2. A Triple Contact Plunger Seal   </b></h4><div>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464987473/kickstarter01_vdzaum.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Up until now, you had to use a food grade adhesive to bond the plunger cane seal to the cane. But not anymore. Our ""plunger cane seal"" is ""over molded"" and</p>
<p>has three levels of contact with the ""outer siphon tube"" guaranteeing that all your thoroughness and attention to detail up until siphoning won’t be lost to oxidization. You can count on preserving flavors and increasing shelf life.</p>
<h4><b>3. A Simple, Functional Removable Check Valve </b></h4>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464987583/kickstarter02_azd1d0.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 585px;height: 585px;""/></p>
<p>A key feature of our siphon is its removable ‘check valve assembly’ that can be quickly cleaned, sanitized, and re-attached in the event of clogging. Making your transfers simple and quick every time.</p>
<div>
<h4><b>4. Easy To Clean and Maintain + Completely Sanitizable</b></h4>
<p>You want to be 100% germ and bacteria free when crafting your batching. So we’ve made it super simple to achieve optimal cleanliness without having to use harmful chemicals to do it. Our Stainless Steel and High Temperature Silicone makes our Pro Brewers Siphon a breeze to clean and resistant to stains, rust, and corrosion. All you need is 1 hour inside of an oven at 212 degrees to completely sanitize your tool.</p>
<h4><b>5. It’s Non-toxic and Eco-friendly </b></h4>
<p>We care about the planet and follow a zero waste policy. That’s why we designed our siphon to be an environmentally better choice. Any reusable material is better than a disposable one. Stainless steel is one of the world’s most recycled materials and widely used in the food and beverage industry — and even in the most sterile surgical environments. Silicone is not a hazardous waste nor toxic to aquatic or soil organisms. So while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled after a lifetime of use.</p>
<h4><b>6. One Tool to Rack Them All -- No Problem </b></h4>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464987678/kickstarter04_vfaitl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>Up until now, brewers needed 2+ different sets of siphons when crafting sour batches versus non sour types of brews. We designed our Pro Brewers Siphon to cater to your unique needs without having to purchase any extra equipment. Because it’s de-constructable, manually cleanable and totally sanitizeable, you now have the freedom to use this one tool to experiment with bacteria, wild yeasts and pull from other experimental sources like wild crafted herbs, spices, or fruits to make your special signature batch at no extra cost.<div>
<h4><b>7. Safest Material For Food and Drinks </b></h4>
<p>Your safety and health is our top priority. Made from FDA approved materials, our Pro Brewers Siphon does not leach chemicals or require a synthetic lining or interior coating. Non-toxic and completely free of BPA, phthalates, lead, zinc and other nasty elements linked to cancer, endocrine disruption, and other health and safety concerns -- we use stainless steel for its antibacterial and hygienic properties and silicone because it’s non-reactive with acidic materials or high temperatures up to 500 degrees. We guarantee a clean, neutral taste that won’t affect flavor or smell like other materials.</p>
<h4><b>8. Sturdy Clip &amp; Carboy Sleeve </b></h4>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464987723/kickstarter06_bvek20.jpg"" src=""""/></p>Efficiency is everything. We’ve designed a proto-typed clip and sleeve that gives you ultimate control over depth adjustment while siphoning. Not only do we ensure that you don’t suck up sediment/debris from the bottom of your bucket or carboy you can now be hands free to perform other tasks during the transfer. It’s just that simple!<div>
<h4><b>9. Reusable, Recyclable &amp; Better For The Planet</b></h4>
<p>8 million metric tons of plastic is dumped into our oceans every year estimating about $13 billion in damages to marine ecosystems each year. Our landfills are also being overloaded with plastic products that can take hundreds of years or more to biodegrade.</p>
<p>The lifespan of these popular plastic products are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plastic Water Bottle - 450 years</li>
<li>Disposable Diapers - 500 years</li>
<li>Plastic 6-Pack Collar - 450 years</li>
<li>Extruded Polystyrene Foam - over 5,000 years</li>
</ul>
<p>This is insane. We try to do our best to try and diminish this number by not adding to it and reducing the amount of material we throw away. Our Pro Brewers Siphon is designed to be reused for many years, passed onto new generations and fully recycled without degradation at the end of its useful life. This means resources are saved and the same material is continuously cycled through the production chain in a sustainable closed-loop system.</p>
<h4><b>10. A Wise Investment In Our Future</b></h4>
<p>Stainless steel is the safest, most durable, reusable, recyclable, and worry-free material available used to make our Pro Brewers Siphon. Choosing our Pro Brewers Siphon for your next transferring tool purchase is an affordable and long-lasting investment that reflects a real commitment to health and environmental sustainability. We stand by our product and hope that it becomes one of your favorite tools and a vessel for some of your favorite memories.</p>

We are both dads who grew up in the foothills of a charming low-key gold rush town called Grass Valley. Community is key for us being from a small town. So when Nevada County’s long standing Home Brew supply shop Sierra Moonshine went up for sale, we purchased the shop and created a community hub for our tribe.<p>The truth is we’re happiest when we are making something good or teaching others something useful. We specialize in supplying ingredients, equipment, rentals and education for passionate Do It Yourselfers, Homesteaders, and Makers to learn the craft, science and art of Home Fermentation and lead a wide range of different fermenting classes on beer, wine, mead, lacto-fermented sodas, kraut, kombucha and cheese making. We're proud to have become the leading Home Brew Store in the Sierra Foothills and greater Northern California area.</p>

<h3><b>Our Promise to You</b></h3>
<p>We strive to deliver the best, most useful and high quality products and hands on education to improve your brewing experience. That’s why when our customers, friends and fellow Brew Club Members came to us with inquiry about how to get rid of the constant problems, frustrations and disappointments they were having with the cheap plastic tools used for performing elemental tasks -- we addressed it immediately. We made it our business to design a high quality “Pro Brewers Siphon” that was durable enough to last a lifetime. We’re always looking for ways to provide more value to our customers and community. Our “Pro Brewers Siphon” is just the first installment in our series of new and improved Home Brewing Essentials.</p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Producing a highly crafted siphon at scale requires tight specifications and detailed systems. We've refined, vetted and tested our Pro Brewers Siphon numerous times to get the project to this point.</p>
<p>We are thrilled about the potential of this game changing tool for the brewing community. With the expert guidance from our Engineer Scott Raitt @ Connekt LLC we have chosen to avoid possible conflicts that can arise from contracting with multiple suppliers to produce one product and have awarded the complete job from beginning to end to a 5 Star rated manufacturing firm in order to guarantee perfect production and assembly of our Pro Brewers Siphon. As with all projects, manufacturing the product can run into risks with timing. So we did our very best and have accounted for that with conservative estimates. In the event something slightly changes, we promise to disclose full transparency on any unforeseen issues.</p>

</div><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","Buy on our new Site!The Pro-Brewers Siphon is now the BrewSSSiphon™ and can be purchased directly through our site linked on the logo above. ABOUT THIS PROJECTThe “Pro Brewers Siphon” is the ultimate hassle free, completely sanitizable ""ONE TOOL TO RACK THEM ALL"" home brewing siphon starter designed to cater to a wide range of fermentation practices, equipment, and styles. As devoted brewers who love what we do, we designed the FIRST and only de-constructible, durable and completely sanitizable Home Brew siphon starter that makes the “Perfect Rack” easy every time.It’s a reliable transferring tool that is easily sanitized, virtually unbreakable and offers flexibility to do more experimentation without having to use multiple siphons in order to do it.Not only does it perform 10 times better than what we’ve been use to, but it also saves time and money. It’s also possible to rack from anything; Bucket, Kettle, Carboy, Barrel -- all with just this one tool.10 Good Reasons Why You Should Own & Use Our Pro Brewers SiphonFor starters, it works like a champ. Whether you’re a professional, amateur or beginner, the versatility of application is so simple to use that we’re confident the Pro Brewers Siphon will quickly become the #1 choice of all Home Brewers regardless of experience. Made entirely out of stainless steel and silicone, our “Pro Brewers Siphon” eliminates all of the transfer problems that you run into as a brewer, such as bacteria contamination or oxygen leaks that cause oxidation in your batches.1. Designed for Durability & Longevity Strong enough to last a lifetime, our strong, impact resistant, 100% reusable and 100% recyclable, Pro Brewers Siphon is the best-performing and most practical choice for long-life transferring tools.Unlike conventional petroleum-based plastic products that can crack or degrade with repeated use, we’ve eliminated potential leaks, cracks and corrosion that can lead to bacterial contamination. We’ve combined food-grade #304 stainless steel and silicone to keep deterioration from happening. It has a superior strength-to-weight ratio compared to other grades of conventional plastics, or compostable PLA plastic.2. A Triple Contact Plunger Seal   
 

Up until now, you had to use a food grade adhesive to bond the plunger cane seal to the cane. But not anymore. Our ""plunger cane seal"" is ""over molded"" and
has three levels of contact with the ""outer siphon tube"" guaranteeing that all your thoroughness and attention to detail up until siphoning won’t be lost to oxidization. You can count on preserving flavors and increasing shelf life.
3. A Simple, Functional Removable Check Valve 
 

A key feature of our siphon is its removable ‘check valve assembly’ that can be quickly cleaned, sanitized, and re-attached in the event of clogging. Making your transfers simple and quick every time.

4. Easy To Clean and Maintain + Completely Sanitizable
You want to be 100% germ and bacteria free when crafting your batching. So we’ve made it super simple to achieve optimal cleanliness without having to use harmful chemicals to do it. Our Stainless Steel and High Temperature Silicone makes our Pro Brewers Siphon a breeze to clean and resistant to stains, rust, and corrosion. All you need is 1 hour inside of an oven at 212 degrees to completely sanitize your tool.
5. It’s Non-toxic and Eco-friendly 
We care about the planet and follow a zero waste policy. That’s why we designed our siphon to be an environmentally better choice. Any reusable material is better than a disposable one. Stainless steel is one of the world’s most recycled materials and widely used in the food and beverage industry — and even in the most sterile surgical environments. Silicone is not a hazardous waste nor toxic to aquatic or soil organisms. So while it is not biodegradable, it can be recycled after a lifetime of use.
6. One Tool to Rack Them All -- No Problem 
 
Up until now, brewers needed 2+ different sets of siphons when crafting sour batches versus non sour types of brews. We designed our Pro Brewers Siphon to cater to your unique needs without having to purchase any extra equipment. Because it’s de-constructable, manually cleanable and totally sanitizeable, you now have the freedom to use this one tool to experiment with bacteria, wild yeasts and pull from other experimental sources like wild crafted herbs, spices, or fruits to make your special signature batch at no extra cost.
7. Safest Material For Food and Drinks 
Your safety and health is our top priority. Made from FDA approved materials, our Pro Brewers Siphon does not leach chemicals or require a synthetic lining or interior coating. Non-toxic and completely free of BPA, phthalates, lead, zinc and other nasty elements linked to cancer, endocrine disruption, and other health and safety concerns -- we use stainless steel for its antibacterial and hygienic properties and silicone because it’s non-reactive with acidic materials or high temperatures up to 500 degrees. We guarantee a clean, neutral taste that won’t affect flavor or smell like other materials.
8. Sturdy Clip & Carboy Sleeve 
 
Efficiency is everything. We’ve designed a proto-typed clip and sleeve that gives you ultimate control over depth adjustment while siphoning. Not only do we ensure that you don’t suck up sediment/debris from the bottom of your bucket or carboy you can now be hands free to perform other tasks during the transfer. It’s just that simple!
9. Reusable, Recyclable & Better For The Planet
8 million metric tons of plastic is dumped into our oceans every year estimating about $13 billion in damages to marine ecosystems each year. Our landfills are also being overloaded with plastic products that can take hundreds of years or more to biodegrade.
The lifespan of these popular plastic products are as follows:

Plastic Water Bottle - 450 years
Disposable Diapers - 500 years
Plastic 6-Pack Collar - 450 years
Extruded Polystyrene Foam - over 5,000 years

This is insane. We try to do our best to try and diminish this number by not adding to it and reducing the amount of material we throw away. Our Pro Brewers Siphon is designed to be reused for many years, passed onto new generations and fully recycled without degradation at the end of its useful life. This means resources are saved and the same material is continuously cycled through the production chain in a sustainable closed-loop system.
10. A Wise Investment In Our Future
Stainless steel is the safest, most durable, reusable, recyclable, and worry-free material available used to make our Pro Brewers Siphon. Choosing our Pro Brewers Siphon for your next transferring tool purchase is an affordable and long-lasting investment that reflects a real commitment to health and environmental sustainability. We stand by our product and hope that it becomes one of your favorite tools and a vessel for some of your favorite memories.

Who We Are & How We Got Here
 
Hi we’re Justin Coyle and Anthony Schoensee. We are both dads who grew up in the foothills of a charming low-key gold rush town called Grass Valley. Community is key for us being from a small town. So when Nevada County’s long standing Home Brew supply shop Sierra Moonshine went up for sale, we purchased the shop and created a community hub for our tribe.The truth is we’re happiest when we are making something good or teaching others something useful. We specialize in supplying ingredients, equipment, rentals and education for passionate Do It Yourselfers, Homesteaders, and Makers to learn the craft, science and art of Home Fermentation and lead a wide range of different fermenting classes on beer, wine, mead, lacto-fermented sodas, kraut, kombucha and cheese making. We're proud to have become the leading Home Brew Store in the Sierra Foothills and greater Northern California area.

</div></div>","Managing all the various remotes can be a real pain, especially when the ones you want are missing, broken or mixed up. It could be dangerous too, given the prevalence of the current pandemic and the fact that remote is reportedly to be the germiest thing in your room — more disease-causing germs than the bathroom door handle.
Introducing SmartEgg Pro, the ultimate smart control that rules all the infrared home appliances and makes your life easier, healthier and better.

 
 


 
SmartEgg Pro can learn or copy from any IR remote for you to control everything using just its App: TV, cable box, projector, DVD player, Blu-ray, Apple TV, Fire TV, audio system, game player, air conditioners, heaters and lights, more than 200,000 (with more added daily) different kinds of household devices. 
The SmartEgg Pro App is user-friendly, extremely versatile and powerful.
 
 
It also protects you and your loved ones from touching the remotes crawling with bacteria, viruses and other nasty organisms capable of transmitting colds, infections and diseases.

reate a series of most used commands and activate it all with one touch on your smartphone. 

For instance, you could set up a “leaving home” event that turns off lights and heatings as you are leaving for the day to save energy or a “football night” event that turns on TV, stereo and cable box, set to a certain channel and volume and dims the lights for you.

Connect with SmartEgg Pro over WiFi network to control devices at home from your mobile device when you are away on a trip or beyond its Bluetooth range. 
   
You could have your home robotic vacuum cleaner crawl around the floors sweeping the dust anytime you want when you are far off on a trip.

Trigger automated tasks according to your location ranges from 0.1m~50m (with the Bluetooth turned on and the App running on the background on your phone)to the SmartEgg Pro.
   
Imagine this, as you walk in, your bedroom lights, A/C, TV, cable box, stereo will automatically turn on for you without you touching any remote or smartphone.

SmartEgg Pro works with Echo,  Google Home, so you can speak to these voice assistants to control SmartEgg Pro to send 360° full coverage IR commands to smart home products.

 
 

SmartEgg Pro surpasses other remotes with its advanced Bluetooth 5.1 mesh networking, that is many-to-many SmartEgg Pro communications optimized for creating large-scale networks to cover every corner of your house.

This is ideal for secure and reliable automations even without internet connection of a large number of devices in different rooms in your house. Devoid of internet access, you can still perform off-line controls through SmartEgg Pro to all the devices on the Bluetooth mesh. The internet is only necessary when downloading a new remote to SmartEgg Pro or to using it with a third device which requires an internet connection.
 
 

 
You can schedule time-related commands using SmartEgg Pro, such as turning on or off the lights and closing or opening motorized blinds at specific times on specific days needless for you to say or touch a thing.

 

The built-in thermometer in the SmartEgg Pro monitors realtime room temperature, records it in the App (12 months max.) and uses the set thresholds to govern the heating/cooling system to keep the room temperature pleasant and the energy usage low.
   

 
SmartEgg Pro supports IFTTT to create chains of customary conditional actions with all your applications and appliances. For example, if a food delivery app informs SmartEgg Pro that the food is at your door, then SmartEgg Pro will send commands to turn on the outdoor lights and unlock the front door for the food delivery person automatically.

 

 
SmartEgg Pro will immediately auto mute any device with volume control (speakers, stereos, TV, media players, etc.) when an incoming or outgoing call is detected for a clear and uninterrupted phone call. It will resume the volume when the phone call ends.

Finally, it’s here! The travel mug all tea and coffee lovers have been waiting for!Regular travel mugs are designed to store water or beverage that are already made. And that means one more thing you need to clean.Recharge by VIVA is a versatile solution that brews hot and iced tea. It also makes coffee. It solves the headache of over-steeping, leaking lids and maintaining the optimal temperature of our drink until the very last drop. 
 You can use the built-in Smart Brewer system to steep your favourite breakfast tea in the morning or make iced coffee on a hot afternoon. Or maybe you enjoy serving up delicious iced cold Southern sweet tea for two, just like your grandma made, in under 4 minutes? Whatever your choice, your beverage will last all day.
 

  Recharge is the Swiss Army knife for Beverage. It’s a tumbler, teapot, tea infuser, iced tea maker, coffee press, thermos, and water bottle. This one does it all. It's everything you need for tea and coffee at a fraction of the cost.On a budget? Recharge is an economic choice for a premium loose leaf tea experience.Minimal living space? Recharge can help you declutter your cupboard.Unlike other tea infusers, Recharge has a large capacity. It makes over 16 ounces (460ml) of delicious drink, keeping you satisfied and hydrated all day. And when you remove the infuser basket, Recharge holds 18 ounces (520ml) of liquid - enough to get your Grande fix.  The double-sealing mechanism in our no-leak lid passes the Shirshasana test. Guaranteed. Say good-bye to bitter tea. Our one-of-a-kind brew stop innovation, the Smart Brew, allows you 100% control over the steeping time to achieve optimum flavour. Get the most from your luxury loose leaf tea. Water flows across all the leaves to achieve the most robust tea experience available today.  What's your pleasure? The innovative Smart Brew system comes with a uniquely engineered micro-filter infuser designed to handle even the smallest tea particles like hibiscus and rooibos. The ergonomic design from top to bottom will feel like an extension of your body. Our quick-change interchangeable filter allows you to switch between tea and coffee (if you’re into that sort of thing). No muss, no fuss. Completely and easily disassembles for quick cleaning. Take it everywhere. Designed to fit most cup holders.  Long-lasting freshness guaranteed. Hot liquids stay warm for 6 hours. Cold liquids stay chilled for 12 hours. Brew your hot tea or iced tea at home or on the go, and it will keep its ideal temperature for as long as your beverage lasts. Need a cold drink to hydrate after a workout or yoga class? No problem. Simply remove the Smart Brew basket and take your Recharge with you as a daily to-go travel mug. Not only will your drink stay hot or cold for hours, taking out the infuser basket adds another 2 ounces (60 mL) to the Recharge so you can fill it with your favourite Grande-sized beverage. And by choosing Recharge, you'll eliminate a disposable cup and help the environment by reducing waste. 
Are you someone who shops for quality products that will last for years and years? Recharge is made of premium, German medical grade stainless steel. This is the most durable stainless available -- it will not break or rust. We're engraving our name directly on the powder coating so the natural stainless shines through as our guarantee to you that the Recharge won't rust. Recharge is the Swiss Army knife of teaware. See how it stacks up against other products in your cupboard.

From attaching the tools to emptying the dust canister, we're showing you how it's done.Montanc works wonders when paired with its additional nozzles. It leaves no dust in any corner, crack, or crevice! Meet Montanc,The only handheld vacuum that weighs in at only 1.2 lbs and has the insane suction power strong enough to effortlessly pick up an iPad. Light and powerful, our relentless engineering and attentive design are what makes cleaning with Montanc fun AND effortless.  We can prove it. Just watch. Redefining the standard for handheld vacuums
 
 Our rigorous market research showed us that there was a high demand for a handheld vacuum that combines power, versatility, and convenience all in one design! With that in mind, we rolled up our sleeves and got to work to design Montanc, a feather-light handheld vacuum with the power of an upright vacuum that rivals those of premium brands. And let's be honest.. it's also easy on the eyes! So stay calm and scroll on to learn more about the wonders of Montanc! 
  
 You spoke. We listened. During the research stage of Montanc, we focused on the users' pain points. Here are some of the major takeaways from the surveys we conducted: ?‍♂️ Upright vacuums are so friggin bulky! I just can't seem to get the dust that accumulates right on the corners.?‍♀️ Handheld vacuums wear out so quickly! Used mine for a little less than a year and now it can't even pick up cookie crumbs or hair that my girlfriend leaves all over the floor every time she visits.""  WHAT DO PEOPLE THINK ABOUT MONTANC? 
 


 

  
       Two Power Modes  Mode I: With the suction power of 6,000 Pa, picks up your typical-sized particles and debris in a blink of an eye. And mode I can used for 30 mins once you fully charge.
Endless amounts of hair left on the floor by your significant other or pet dog
Crumbs that have somehow navigated its way to the tiniest cracks and tight corners
Household debris stuck in tumble dryer filters
Mode II: Picks up microparticles that can't be seen by the naked eye as well as larger chunks of debris with the suction power of 15,000 Pa. Just press the button to switch from mode I to II. And mode II  can used for 9 mins once you fully charge.
Microdust, pollen, and other allergens
Larger cereal pieces on kitchen floors 
Dead insects on window sills
Tiny gravels and leaves from plant pots
 Fade-free suction picks up hair in a second
 No more crumbs in the cracks
 Goodbye tumble dryer fluff!
 Unprecedented Power-To-Weight Ratio. The chart below shows some of the best-selling handheld vacuums on Amazon, organized by suction power and weight.  Most vacuums' weights go hand in hand with the suction power. Powerful vacuums are heavy. Smaller vacuums are weak. But if you want the best of both worlds, Montanc is the way to go.  The Experiments  Handheld vacuums in the industry have an average suction power of 2-5k Pa. Our vacuum packs a whopping 15kPa.  
 With Montanc, you don't have to compromise power ever again.     Experiment #1Here's one of the strongest handheld vacuums available on the market today. Placed side by side with Montanc, the difference is night and day. Average handheld vacuums 2-5kPa
  MONTANC clocking in at 15kPa   Experiment #2 MONTANC is overwhelmingly more powerful compared to any other handheld vacuums on the market right now.     Experiment #3We purchased a 45m (or 148 ft)-long garden hose to see if the suction power fades. Garden hose purchased in Seoul, Korea, where our manufacturing factory is located
     The Technology Behind The Magic  Our team is made up of ex-Samsung engineers (from the vacuum cleaner product engineering team at Samsung, to be exact) with years of industry-relevant experience in optimizing product structures.Such power is only possible because of our Brushless Direct Current ++ motors (BLDC++ in short).  This 120w motor clocks in at 76,000rpm which allows Montanc to produce 15kPa while staying insanely compact.  
  
 

 
Weighing in at only 535g (1.18 lbs), Montanc is ultra-portable and so lightweight that you can toss it around like a baton (though we recommend you don't ?). Keep scrolling to see how you can combine different extensions for various situations. We promise you won't be disappointed.     Weighs less than a 20oz Powerade bottle Montanc is thoughtfully designed to blend right into the aesthetics of your beautiful home. Instead of hiding it in a closet where you keep all your cleaning supplies, place Montanc in a visible location. That makes it even easier to access! The charging station (that also comes in the box) adds to the design.  Another place Montanc will shine in is your car. Vacuuming your car can be a pain in the ass. We get that, but don't just let all that dirt sit there. Have Montanc sweep up those crumbs before they even hit the floor. *We are in the process of designing a car charger for Montanc. We will give you guys an update as soon as we can!  Your office is ideally a place where business gets done.

</div></div>","TRAVEL SPACE without leaving the Earth.AstroReality's first AR-enabled Space Mug is available now EXCLUSIVELY on Indiegogo! 

Imagine you are enjoying the best moment of your morning, take a sip and let your mind wander. 

Scanning the space mug using our AstroReality Explorer app (available at the Apple Store and Google Play), you can experience the view of an astronaut suspended in the spaceship cabin.

Looking at the blue planet from an astronaut's view - the AmazonRainforest, the Vatnajokull National Park in Iceland, the Himalayas, the Grand Canyon in the United States...

Flying over the Himalayas



Flying over the Amazon Forest

All the stunning natural scenery, more than 200 countries and regions, and the fascinating beauty of more than 10,000 cities will slowly pass in front of your eyes.

The moment you gaze through the AstroReality Space Mug and gaze upon the miraculous complexity, and dynamic beauty of our planet, your day, your sense of inspiration and your determination will awaken like never before. 
 


We created a physical artifact that allows you to get in touch with Space in your daily life.

 
We love a starry night because we realize human beings are as small as a grain of dust compared to the huge universe. When you look at the stars, you feel that the difficulties of the world melt away. there is a special attraction to feeling distant and unknown, and humans have never given up the pursuit and exploration of space.
As of June 17, 2018, there have been only 561 brave humans who have seen the world through space. Even though it is expected that the first private lunar trip could be launched by 2023, it still requires years of technical preparation and a fortune to go. The journey seems out of reach for most of us.

This is the Earth photographed by the International Space Station. The spectacular and beautiful sights seen by astronauts may be the perspective that we could never have in our lifetime.
With the same dreams and curiosity as “Creating the Moon”, our Space Mug with AR-enabled technology, makes it possible for you to experience space travel without leaving the Earth. No matter where you are, you can travel around the Earth with the mug in your hand and enjoy the best view in the world.
The first stop of the spaceship, let’s visit our most familiar home together - the Earth.

 


We believe that future spaceships may represent the possibility itself. It is mysterious and there is no single ready-made element to define. Our Space Mug was designed to be as abstract as possible to allow you to use your imagination.

In order to design the ideal AstroReality Space Mug, we have made several attempts.
Inspired by the different aircraft in reality and science fiction, we added new elements to explore, imaging the different shapes of the mug;

With reference to modern industrial design and parametric design, we tested different cup types to abstractly show the future spaceship;

All shapes can be abstracted with facets, so we decided to use the facets and hexagons to outline the shape of the mug;

Hand-made models, polish and adjust the cup details;

Finally, introducing the AstroReality Space Mug.

The mug is 70mm wide and 120mm tall; 
Soft simple hexagonal lines, presenting the contours of the future spaceship; ​
The slim, streamlined cup shape and tightened waist are created for a comfortable grip.
In order to find the best light transmission, we constantly adjusted the thickness of the wall, which reflects the layering of light under the illumination.

The material is finally chosen to be ceramic. Pure white represents infinite possibilities. 

This future spaceship mug will also be an elegant piece of art on the table.

Inspired by the snow white color, the sleek lines and the bird’s eye view of Earth, we have named this product Cygnus, after the constellation of the swan. The AstroReality Space Mug (A.S.M.) Cygnus can now be yours. 

This is not the final look of the package. See the reference from the future updates.
Let's use the A.S.M. Cygnus Spaceship to leave the surface of the earth, and look at the blue planet from a bird's eye view.




 
Sometimes a little light can make everything different. In order to realize ""watching space with mugs"", we try to enable the AR interactive experience, so that we could cross the physical distance and look at the views from the height.
The interior of the cup is transformed into the cabin of a future spacecraft, and the cabin structure inside the mug is presented by AR technology;

We have prepared a landscape of 500 million square kilometers of Earth. The data comes from NASA and USGS high-definition satellite photos, covering the entire surface of the Earth.


Are you ready to start you “space travel around the earth”?

Scan the AstroReality Space Mug with AstroReality Explorer app (available at Apple Store and Google Play). Enjoy the AR experience of looking at the Earth from the simulated spaceship.


 

The view of the Earth from the AstroReality Space Mug Cygnus is the real satellite world map from space. We utilize the data from NASA satellites in our augmented reality app.


When people look up at the stars, you are looking at the blue planet and seeing the scenery of 510,000,000 square kilometers.

We have also designed a series of small accessories for the mug. We hope it can be a decoration for the space scenery, and also adding a little joy to the spaceship mug.

Accessories development process
Astronaut Stirrer 
 A stirrer made of silicone is placed on the edge of the cup wall, like a small astronaut climbing along the rope. He is exploring the interior of the spaceship for us.

Earth Aerial View Coaster
The round coaster is printed with photos of the Earth photographed by the Apollo, creating a sense of visiting the Earth from an upper view by the spaceship mug.


 
 
 
We create each of AstroReality product with heart. All the fundraising will be invested in the full production of this model from prototype to finished product, including:

Procurement of raw materials;
Factory model and mold production;
AR interaction tailored for Space Mug.

To say thanks to the first batch of AstroReality space travelers, we prepared crowdfunding perks with the best deal prices and unlocking rewards for our backers.

It bridges the fragmented islands of your smart home and channels your video streams. We experienced the frustration of smart home products that promise to make your life easier but refuse to work together.The Homy Player leverages Z-Wave® technology to link thousands of home automation, home security, and Internet of Things (IoT) products into an interface that works the way you think.The Homy Player also runs Android TV which lets you stream high definition - even 4K - video from Netflix®, YouTube®, and more into your home entertainment system. Add on to that thousands of apps and games optimized for the TV experience. Connecting the Disconnected HomeThe smart home is supposed to make our lives easier. Connected light bulbs, smart thermostats, security webcams, and all of the other Internet of Things devices out there come with that built-in promise. But they fail.Each vendor tries to create a walled garden around their products. As long as you buy all of your IoT stuff from that vendor, they work great. Try to get products from different vendors to work together? That’s another story altogether.All of us on the SmartHomy team have been bashing our heads against that wall for years. At one point we filled two screens on a smartphone with “connected” apps. That was the only way to make our homes smart.We think tech is fun and we love digging into a problem to make things work. But we’re developers and designers and engineers. That’s the way we think. Our friends and our families, though, they don’t think like us.We designed the Homy Player to solve the problem we all face and bring the separate pieces of the smart home together in one elegant box.  The Homy Player uses Z-Wave multifrequency, the world’s leading wireless control technology. More than 450 vendors have designed over 1,250 products to comply with the Z-Wave protocol.The number of Z-Wave certified products in use today has already passed 50 million. That means your Homy Player will probably control every smart device in your house right now.  The Homy App is the key to that control. We make setting things up easier by avoiding the procedural approach many vendors impose. Why should you program each and every step for every device? Tech may work that way, but we don’t think like that.Just set your devices for a scene in your life - watch Netflix, leave for work, waking up - and the Homy App’s Scene Recording System remembers it. From now on just use the the Homy App to activate the scene and your home responds.The Homy Player also reacts. Your Internet of Things devices can trigger the LED’s on the front of the Homy Player. Flashing red lights for a security alert. Pulsing blue lights for the kitchen timer. The RGB LEDs can be turned off or set any color you want, making it easy to tell which system is sending what kind of alert.And...  Video was a lot easier back in the day. Watch a handful of TV networks, go to the movies, make a run for the video store. Now content is spread across many streaming services each one with its own subscription and its own app. A wide range of boxes lets you send those streams to your home entertainment system, but the Homy Player goes a lot further. The Homy Player lets you watch more video streams thanks to the Android TV operating system. Rent movies through the Play store or access your favorite streaming services. YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Twitch and more are right there in all their widescreen glory.The Homy Player is even ready for your 4K HDR Ultra HD television. An Amlogic octa-core ARM processor supports hardware decoding of HDR content at 60 frames per second.Unlike many streaming boxes the Homy Player also supports traditional TV. We will ship your Homy Player with a built-in tuner specific to your country. We support the DVB-S2, DVB-C/T/T2, ATSC, and ISDB-T formats you need to get free local content no matter where you live.  3D High Definition GamingEven if you have a PlayStation or an Xbox (or both), having more choices is always better -especially when friends or family want to play. Whatever game – 3D, arcade, puzzle - fits your mood, the Home Player can get it for you through the Game store.These aren’t smartphone games stretched to fit a big screen. These games are optimized for the TV and deliver high definition surround sound entertainment. And thanks to the Homy Player’s quad-core processor, 3GB DDR III memory and 32GB of storage you have all of the performance and capacity to handle the most demanding 3D high definition games.Even though the Homy Remote is not a full-featured game controller, we added small touches that make the Homy Player ready for games out of the box. Use up to four Homy Remotes with your multi-player games to turn every night into game night.Soft textured, backlit buttons make the Homy Remote a nice little gamepad. A built-in gyroscope turns your gestures into commands whether your game takes you racing through the streets or flying through space.   The Homy PlayerWhen we started this project, we went out and bought as many streaming boxes, game boxes, and IoT hubs as we could. We lined them up on a table and saw they had one thing in common: they were all ordinary black boxes. We took a more elegant approach with the Homy Player. Premium materials like the soft touch surfaces and a copper-anodized, brushed aluminum base take industrial design to the next level.Yes, it looks nice, but we are engineers. Form still follows function. The aluminum base is a heat sink that rapidly cools the high-performance hardware inside. Amlogic’s award-winning S912 processor is based on the ARM octa-core 64-bit Cortex-A53 design as well as ARM’s multi-core Mali-820MP3 graphics processor. Dynamic adjustments of active cores and voltage levels ensures the Homy Player gets performance on demand without excessive power consumption.Integrate your Homy Player into your smart home with high speed wired and wireless connections including gigabit Ethernet, supercharged 802.11ac Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth 4.0LE.The integrated Z-Wave radio will relay commands and notifications throughout your home – no dongles needed!Connect your Homy Player into your home entertainment system. The HDMI 2.0a port supports 60 frames per second high definition and 4K HDR Ultra HD content as well as 10-bit surround sound audio enhanced by Dolby Digital Plus or DTS.Our standards-based design, and third-party DRM licensing, ensures that you get compatibility with the widest range of apps and hardware. Netflix, Google Widevine and Microsoft PlayReady cover the entire range of DRM possibilities to ensure you can run any video stream.Z-Wave and Android TV’s control options ship with the Homy Player, but you can count on us to deliver new ways to control your smart home. Our developers are working hard to get Alexa and the Google Assistant added as an update. The Homy RemoteBluetooth Remote controls have been around for a long time so why do so many companies get them wrong?

And say hello to custom-crafted spirits.Alkemista is all-in-one spirits infusion vessel that enables anyone to craft and serve fresh, custom infused cocktails at home or in a bar — using fresh fruit, spices, herbs and botanicals.We began with a quest to craft a better cocktail and discovered that fresh spirits infusions were the key to creating remarkable cocktails and bitters. So we set out to design a bar tool that would simplify the process of spirits infusions. By marrying the timeless design of the classic spirits bottle with the beautiful simplicity of Japanese teapots, Alkemista makes the art of infusion easy.TIMELESS DESIGN. LAB-GRADE QUALITY. REMARKABLE INFUSED SPIRITS.The Alkemista infusion vessel combines the timeless design of a classic spirits bottle with the simple technology of fine Japanese teapots - making it easy to create custom spirits at home or in a bar. Alkemista's lab-grade borosilicate glass bottle was designed to look and feel like a traditional spirits bottle and is large enough to hold a full 750ml of spirits, plus plenty of infusion ingredients. The elegant design is highly-durable and feels as good in the hand as it looks on the counter or back bar.The removable ultra-fine infusion filter allows you to seamlessly infuse, pour, serve and store your custom creation without the need for separate filters, funnels or bottles. It was cleverly designed to introduce the delicate flavors and aromas of fresh fruits, spices, and botanicals into your spirit while preventing the unwanted particles and bitter elements from escaping into the liquid.

With your help, let's make Kasia the best and most easy to use one yet!Featured on:Kasia is the first affordable smart home system. It’s about time your home was as smart as your phone.Control and monitor all your electronic devices in your home.
Lights come on automatically as I come home in the dark.
My coffee pot is hot and ready for me in the morning.
I am reminded when I accidentally leave my refrigerator door open.
My laundry tells me when it's done.
I save money by knowing which devices use the most electricity so I can make sure to turn them off when not in use.
I don't need to search my house to make sure I've turned off all the lights. A simple press of a button and it's done.  
Have your lights turn on automatically as you come home with Kasia Presence.Simply put, Kasia beats competitors on both price and features.Kasia is made up of individual devices that work together to help you take control of your home. Product installation is as simple as plugging it into an outlet. Walkthrough instructions are available right in the app for every device, making even a wall switch installation approachable. With the Kasia app on your smartphone, you can monitor and control your system from anywhere at the touch of a button.Every Kasia device is interconnected with other Kasia devices around it to create a better connection. Gain peace of mind knowing that your lights and appliances are turned off when you are not at home. You will never again spend the day wondering if you left that space heater on.No more wrinkled clothes or spoiled food or worrying about burning down your house!Have your lights turn on and off while you are away on vacation giving people the illusion you are home. The Kasia app even knows when sunrise and sunset is so your lights can turn on exactly when they need to.This is Kasia Presence in action. Lights automatically turn on as Eric walks into his room. The hallway lights automatically turn off soon after.Select among all unlocked devices. Selecting Kasia Presence includes 2 presence sensors. 1. Install Kasia devices using built in walkthroughs available in the Kasia app   2. In the app, initiate the pairing process 3. Press the button on device for 5 seconds to begin pairing 4. After pairing is complete, simply name your new device and add it to your home pageOver the last three years, we at Kasia have been working to create a home automation system that’s simple, affordable, reliable, and in general, more accessible to our friends and family. We’ve built the network infrastructure from the ground up, reducing costs and assuring reliable connectivity across the home. Each item in the Kasia product line comes with advanced features right out of the box with no monthly fees, making it affordable to expand your Kasia system to cover your whole house. Or office. Or wherever.We’ve gone through numerous iterations on all aspects of Kasia, from hardware design, PCB design, APP design and firmware design to make sure Kasia works.We’ve gone through multiple iterations for every device. All products are in their final design phases and we’ve already submitted them for official safety certifications. We have also already commenced the tooling of parts necessary for mass manufacturing. Unlike other Kickstarter projects, these steps alleviate much of the risk that a Kickstarter backer might face in a product concept.  Kasia is product ready to be manufactured as soon as our Kickstarter is complete.Initial tooling completed and now waiting for revisionsWe have vetted multiple manufactures and have selected primaries and backups to produce Kasia. A list of parts suppliers have been finalized as well.We are a team of professional product developers, designers, and engineers with over 50 years of experience designing, building, and manufacturing products. The core team has been building both software and wireless products for over 10 years with manufacturing expertise to get the product to market quickly and efficiently. We have engineered our products with procurement and ease of manufacturing in mind.We have already invested a tremendous amount of our own money and money from friends and family into creating the system and designs of Kasia. We need your help to raise funds for the last stretch to get Kasia on the market. To deliver Kasia, we still need to complete the product tooling, procure the necessary components, and get the wireless and safety certifications for our devices.Risks and challenges

What If You Could Make Your Own Energy Food?It would be liberating, fun, and save you a ton of money. Imagine the freedom from not needing to stay in line at Starbucks for that 16 oz. Cafe Latte or run to the convenience store to be Red Bullied. Imagine, instead, that you are the creator of your own energy food. Better yet — don’t just imagine. Make it happen.

Talking about coffee - no more — but without worrying about carrying it, spilling it, or burning yourself, among other things.What is the science behind CaffeinAll™?Caffeine is one of the few substances that can pass through the blood-brain barrier, thanks to being a very small molecule that is both water- and oil-soluble. Plus, due to its specific molecular structure, it is capable of alternately being polar and non-polar – so it is able to penetrate brain cell membranes as soon as it passes through the blood brain barrier. There it temporarily replaces adenosine, one of the the brain’s slow-down chemicals, thus increasing alertness and concentration.Caffeine also increases the level of circulating fatty acids and the oxidation rate of these fuels, producing energy for the muscles. For this reason it’s particularly effective in endurance sports, like long-distance running, swimming, and skiing.The encapsulating compounds we use make CaffeinAll™ both free of bitterness and easy to digest. Additionally, they enable it to flow freely and control dosage size.  Our secret formula enables caffeine to be digested quickly and remain concentrated enough to quickly produce significant energy.

GROW YOUR FOOD</strong><br/><br/><strong>VISION:</strong> The ultimate object of design is information. As a designer I display quantities and dimensions; I organize briefs, I explain procedures. Sometimes this has more to do with storytelling than with technical drawings. These stories and their illustrations are traditionally given to  artisans who, in their workshops, mills, or labs, actually turn them into concrete things: objects. But as a designer, I like to design things that anyone can make. A good design today can turn the world population into the biggest creative industry ever known — a crowd factory of sustainable solutions.

<p><strong>READY TO GROW? SUPPORT!</strong><br/>So if you want to start growing your own vegetables, get ELIOOO! <br/>It will show you step by step how to build and run a simple hydroponic system using some inexpensive IKEA boxes. You will be able to start growing plants in your kitchen, on your balcony, in your living room, or even in your office - like I do. <br/>To start right away, ELIOO´s instructions and operation manual can be shipped to you with a beginner growing kit together with all the IKEA boxes you will need so that you do not have to worry about where to find the single hydroponic parts and drive out to an IKEA store.<br/><br/><strong>PERKS DELIVERY</strong><br/>The book will be officially presented at the Venice Biennale of Architecture at the Italian Pavilion during the closing ceremony some time in the Weekend of 23-24-25 of November 2012. My dream would be to deliver my perks before Christmas. However I am not sure this will be possible. A gift certificate that announce the book you want to donate to third parties will be sent to you. <br/>In any case my priority is to make a good and valuable quality product. I'd prefer focus on that, rather than to rush with Christmas orders. If you donate I will make sure a card will be sent to you as proof of your gift.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE CAMPAIGN IS SUCCESSFUL</strong><br/>Independently from the success of this campaign, the book will be completed and the perks will be delivered even if the goal set at the beginning is not reached. For this reason I have decided to publish the book using digital printing. If this campaign reaches the goal I would also be able to cover my expenses and the expenses of the people who are helping me with this project, and execute a high quality book.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE CAMPAIGN IS MORE THAN SUCCESSFUL<br/></strong>We will set up a micropublishing company that could carry different editions of this book (even in different languages) and produce other similar projects in the near future. The micropublishing company would become a branch of my design practice. In this way, I would be able to reinvest in marketing ELIOOO and support the internal research we are carrying out at Conceptual Devices in the field of urban agriculture at an even bigger scale. <br/>I think this would open new possibilities in the way we perceive design, products, and the way they are manufactured. I do not want to produce more items; I want to tell people how to assemble what is already around in the simplest way, and make sure they have fun. This project is a tool to build a community around these topics. </p>

Sometimes this has more to do with storytelling than with technical drawings. These stories and their illustrations are traditionally given to  artisans who, in their workshops, mills, or labs, actually turn them into concrete things: objects. But as a designer, I like to design things that anyone can make. A good design today can turn the world population into the biggest creative industry ever known — a crowd factory of sustainable solutions. Anyone can be the manufacturer of the products I design.
WHAT: ELIOOO is an instruction book about how to build a hydroponic system to grow plants, herbs, or vegetables in your apartment, using IKEA components.
ABOUT THE BOOK: The book will contain hand drawn illustrations, showing you everything you need to know about how to build and run ELIOOO step by step. It will be a printed soft cover book, measuring 21 x 14.5 cm and counting 150-200 pages. It will contain instructions for about how to build and run six different types and sizes of hydroponic devices as described below and as shown in the prototypes depicted here.  These may, however, look slightly different due to improvements and changes that are made after testing.
ELIOOO #4: Is a non-circulating hydroponic device able to host up to four pots. It is ideal for growing aromatic herbs on your kitchen counter, window, or table so that you can grow your favorite fresh herbs next to where they will be used. This system avoids the use of electricity to oxygenate water.
ELIOOO #8: Is a non-circulating hydroponic device able to host up to eight pots. It is ideal for aromatic herbs and leaf vegetables. ELIOOO #8 is designed to cultivate larger kitchen herbs and to allow easy indoor vertical farming. This module can be freely hung on the wall and, if replicated, it generates a suspended indoor “green wall” at a very affordable price. This system avoids the use of electricity to oxygenate water.

ELIOOO #30: Is a circulating hydroponic device able to host up to thirty pots. It is ideal for aromatic herbs and leaf vegetables of all sorts. The system consists of three grow trays connected at a distance of 45 cm from each other. They are suspended with two wall uprights and brackets above a 25 liter reservoir that is covered with a seven pot grow tray. The overall dimensions of the installation are 45 x 160 x 29,7 cm. ELIOOO #30 is ideal for larger vertical indoor farming installations that can be combined with a fully domestic environment, or even integrated with kitchen furniture.

It can, however, be operated with a pump connected to a photovoltaic panel available in most hardware stores.
ELIOOO DESK: Is a non-circulating hydroponic desk device able to host up to eight pots. It is ideal for growing aromatic herbs and leaf vegetables in your workplace. The desk is made with the combination of large reservoirs that suspend the table top, which is designed to have  ELIOOO #8 plugged into it. The bottom of one reservoir can be used to store little gardening tools. This system avoids the use of electricity to oxygenate water.
WHY HYDROPONICS: Hydroponics is a clean, sustainable, and efficient way to grow vegetables using water instead of soil. Hydroponics has enormous advantages compared to traditional agricultural methods. It uses only 10% of the water needed with traditional agriculture, allowing for higher production in smaller spaces. Plants get nourishment directly from a nutrient solution mixed into the water. Consequently, the risk of pests present in the soil is avoided and plants receive the exact nourishment needed for  optimal growth. With hydroponics you do not have to water your plants; you can maintain ideal conditions for growth, without worrying about watering and getting dirty.

It will show you step by step how to build and run a simple hydroponic system using some inexpensive IKEA boxes. You will be able to start growing plants in your kitchen, on your balcony, in your living room, or even in your office - like I do. To start right away, ELIOO´s instructions and operation manual can be shipped to you with a beginner growing kit together with all the IKEA boxes you will need so that you do not have to worry about where to find the single hydroponic parts and drive out to an IKEA store.PERKS DELIVERYThe book will be officially presented at the Venice Biennale of Architecture at the Italian Pavilion during the closing ceremony some time in the Weekend of 23-24-25 of November 2012. My dream would be to deliver my perks before Christmas. However I am not sure this will be possible. A gift certificate that announce the book you want to donate to third parties will be sent to you. In any case my priority is to make a good and valuable quality product. I'd prefer focus on that, rather than to rush with Christmas orders. If you donate I will make sure a card will be sent to you as proof of your gift.
IF THE CAMPAIGN IS SUCCESSFULIndependently from the success of this campaign, the book will be completed and the perks will be delivered even if the goal set at the beginning is not reached. For this reason I have decided to publish the book using digital printing. If this campaign reaches the goal I would also be able to cover my expenses and the expenses of the people who are helping me with this project, and execute a high quality book.
IF THE CAMPAIGN IS MORE THAN SUCCESSFULWe will set up a micropublishing company that could carry different editions of this book (even in different languages) and produce other similar projects in the near future. The micropublishing company would become a branch of my design practice. In this way, I would be able to reinvest in marketing ELIOOO and support the internal research we are carrying out at Conceptual Devices in the field of urban agriculture at an even bigger scale. I think this would open new possibilities in the way we perceive design, products, and the way they are manufactured. I do not want to produce more items; I want to tell people how to assemble what is already around in the simplest way, and make sure they have fun. This project is a tool to build a community around these topics.

<p>My name is Clair and I have been a Christian and an active member of my church for almost 20 years.  In this time I have attended many weddings, baby dedications and baptisms.  When it comes to giving gifts on these occasions I have often thought how great it would be to be able to wrap these gifts in Christian themed wrapping paper, however I have always found that there is a very limited selection of such products.</p>
<p>Having grown tired of the limited choice available I decided to design my own Christian themed greetings cards, gift wrapping paper and accessories.  I now have several completed designs and have funded the costs of samples/test prints myself however, I now need funds in order to meet the costs of having these designs manufactured.</p>
<p>Meeting my full target with your donations would enable me to establish PRAISEntation and to produce colourful, Christian themed gift wrapping paper, greetings cards and gift wrapping accessories.  Further to this, I will also be able to create a website and online store which will make these products available to you, no matter where you are in the world.</p>
<p>Even if I do not meet my full target, your donations will still be used to help meet the costs of establishing PRAISEntation and will be used to build a website and online store.</p>

<p><strong>Dear Friends, Family, and Friends of Friends,</strong></p>
<p>Some of you may have already heard that <strong>Merv and Vivian Hopkins</strong> (Scott and Colleen’s parents) house near Parry Sound  had a <strong>devastating house fire</strong> last Sunday, June 30<sup>th</sup> caused by a propane tank explosion on their back deck.  Thankfully, no one was hurt.</p>
<p> The house, which Merv built in 1977, was engulfed in flames within minutes. The extraordinary volunteer fire department, which was on the scene within 6 minutes, fought the fire for over three hours, mainly containing the fire damage to the attic.  In addition to the damage to the house, approximately half of their belongings have been lost either due to smoke and/or water damage.</p>
<p><strong>Circumstances are such that there was no insurance.</strong></p>
<p> Merv and Vivian’s initially hopeless situation has, in the course of one week, turned into a very hopeful one.   Because the firefighters were able to contain the fire to the attic, the frame and foundation of the house are salvageable.  Great news!</p>
<p>Moreover, the building inspector has given the go ahead to rebuild.  <strong>This is where we need your help!  It will take more than what Merv and Vivian have in savings to rebuild.</strong></p>
<p> Thanks to the tight knit Humphrey Township residents, who know the Hopkins to be valued members of the community, support has started pouring in. Both Merv and Vivian have dedicated countless volunteer hours for many years, in their community of Parry Sound/Humphrey/Sequin through a number of groups and organizations. </p>
<p>Consequently, the community is circling around Merv and Viv as a constant stream of friends, neighbours, and even strangers comes to lend support in way of greeting cards, small monetary donations, supplies, services  and immeasurable moral support.</p>
<p>We are now spreading the word to our larger community of friends (and friends of friends) for those who are willing and able to contribute to the fire support fund.  A great number of small donations can go a long way to helping Merv and Viv get back on their feet with a roof over their heads.</p>
<p>If you’ve never been to Merv and Viv’s, their home was an extremely warm and welcoming one, often with the fresh aroma of Merv’s homemade bread, soups and stews, Vivian’s cakes and pies, jams and preserves and a plethora of other homemade fare.  They had a country inspired decor of press backed chairs, wingback chairs, tiffany lamps, handmade quilts, butter crocks, and other antique treasures.</p>
<p>Our wish is to help them recreate their home.</p>

 An unobstructed drain should be a basic human right. Through its mountain peak design, water can still flow through freely while hair and debris can be caught from the bottom. 
  Whether your drain is surrounded by soap bubbles or hair debris, with HUROYAMA, water can seamlessly flow through the cavities on the summit.  
 ▼ As hair and bubble start building up from the bottom, water can still travel freely down the drain.
 
▼ Traditional drainer's one-dimensional design makes it easy for debris to build upon the surface level, blocking the entrance and causing water to flood. 

 

 
The unique protrusion points on the rim direct the water flow in a spiral fashion, allowing water to efficiently pass through.
 
 
- Grippy Exterior
Textured exterior makes it easy to pick up in slippery conditions. It also helps prevent hair from flowing through easily.
- Skidproof Base
Glossy finish increases the adhesive characteristics of the silicone material, ensuring that they stay firmly on the drainer. 

 
▼ Hair and debris can be easily removed. Rinse with water and it’s as good as new.  

 
▼ Anchoring points help stabilize the rim.
 

 
HR-BIODCIDE silver ion particle can effectively eliminate 99.99% of bacteria, ensuring a bacteria and mold-free bathroom even under humid conditions.

 

 
5mm anchoring legs stick firmly on the drainer holes, preventing the catcher from drifting when a large flow of water is encountered. They can be easily nipped off if necessary.  

 
▼ Place it n’ forget it. Tool-free installation, easy to clean.
 
▼ Compatible with bathtub drain.

 

 
Flexible silicone material bounces back to its original shape. You’ll never have to endure another lego-stepping pain.

<div>3D models of <strong>bakercube</strong> are available on <strong><a href=""https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2676324"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thingiverse</a></strong> since Dec 2017. They were ranked #1 on thingiverse in popularity for over 20 weeks. The filament cost for 3D printed bakercube is approximately $3 USD if you have your own 3D printer, and the printing time is roughly 8 hours.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It is not practical to download our 3D model from <a href=""https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2676324"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>thingiverse</strong></a> and try to print it using a commercial 3D print service; the cost of such print would be extreme due to the processing time required. For example, a popular site shapeways would charge $125 USD to print it in plastic, with all characteristics of a 3D printed model as in the table above.</div>

<div>As with any object filled to a brim, we need to rotate it fast when pouring. The geometry of a ""spout"" in <strong>bakercube</strong> is (almost) as good as in a pouring pot, a product designed exclusively for pouring liquids.</div>
<div>Chamfered edges (vs rounded edges on thingiverse models) introduced to make <strong>bakercube </strong>compatible with the injection molding technology had a great side effect of improving the flow of liquids, seen in the video above.</div>

<p>There are countless definitions of a <strong>cup</strong>, and many people are very passionate about the subject, so we need to tread lightly.</p>
<p>In the US, two systems are used: the <strong>legal cup</strong>, 240 mL, used for all nutritional info we find on food packages and the <strong>customary cup</strong>, 236.58 mL, used for food recipes, unless they are specified in <strong>legal units</strong>, then we go back to 240 mL.</p>
<p>If you measure a <strong>cup</strong> of coffee in the US, it’s 118.3 mL, but don’t confuse it with the unit of a <strong>cup</strong> of water needed to prepare a <strong>cup</strong> of coffee, that’s 147.8 mL.</p>
<p>In many countries, a <strong>metric cup</strong> 250 mL is used. And no, it is not an official SI unit.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in Canada, their <strong>cup</strong> is 227.3 mL. Travel south to Latin America and it becomes 200 mL. If you visit Japan, their <strong>metric cup</strong> is 180.4 mL, but only for sake, otherwise it’s a 200 mL unit.</p>
<p>For those claiming superiority of the metric system, always a valid point, they need to examine closely measuring cups sold throughout Europe: <strong>1 cup</strong> is 250 mL, <strong>1/2 cup</strong> is 125 mL (or 120 mL), <strong>1/3 cup </strong>is almost always 80 mL, and <strong>1/4 cup</strong> is almost always 60 mL.</p>
<p>250 divided by 3 is never 80; 250 divided by 4 is not 60.</p>
<p>We had to start somewhere with our <strong>bakercube</strong> project; it would be impossible to release it in so many cup variations.</p>
<p><strong>bakercube</strong> is based on the <strong>US legal system</strong>, with the metric conversion.<br/><strong>1</strong> <strong>legal cup</strong> <strong>= 240 mL</strong>.</p>
<p>The argument “the metric cup is 250 mL, not 240 mL” is not a valid one: <strong>bakercube</strong> uses the <strong>US legal cup</strong>, and not a <strong>metric</strong> <strong>cup</strong> (whatever that means, because <strong>metric</strong> <strong>cups</strong> come in different flavors, from 250 mL to  180 mL).</p>
<p>In the end, if you use <strong>bakercube</strong> to measure ingredients and they are specified in <strong>US legal</strong>, or <strong>customary</strong>, or <strong>metric</strong> or anything in-between, you simply end up with a bit more or a bit less of the final product, the ratios of ingredients should remain correct.</p>
<p>For the <strong>metric</strong> purists questioning a barely noticeable difference between the <strong>legal</strong> and the <strong>customary</strong> US units, please cut us some slack. After all, you accepted the formula of 4 x 60 mL = 250 mL used in metric cups, when 4 x 60 mL = 240 mL using the proper math.</p>
<p>If you require a high level of precision, it's always better to use a scale. Measuring by volume is affected by many factors, including your technique, the temperature and the humidity. <strong>bakercube</strong> is a great tool to have for recipes specified by volume, a standard for the US market.</p>
<p>Follow up products:</p>
<p>In the future, we plan to release other versions of <strong>bakercube</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>mini</strong><strong>cube</strong>: starting at 1/2 cup | 3D model available on <strong><a href=""https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2676324/#files"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thingiverse</a></strong> today</p>

<p><strong>metric only</strong>: 250 mL, 120 mL, 80 mL, 60 mL... following existing standards</p>
<p><strong>metric only</strong>: 200 mL, 100 mL, 50 mL, 25 mL... for Latin America and Japan</p>
<p><strong>minimetric</strong>: 125 mL, 100 mL, 75 mL, 50 mL...</p>
<p><strong>US customary</strong> with and without mL conversion</p>
<p>For sake of simplicity and sanity, the <strong>US legal cup</strong> with the metric equivalents seems to be a perfect starting point for this project; it was the option chosen by 300+ of our friends on thingiverse who participated in our online survey.</p>

3D models of bakercube (3D printed in green color above) were viewed 300,000+ times and downloaded 69,000+ times on thingiverse, where they were tested and improved for over 6 months based on the feedback we received from thingiverse community.
 

 


 




3D models of bakercube are available on thingiverse since Dec 2017. They were ranked #1 on thingiverse in popularity for over 20 weeks. The filament cost for 3D printed bakercube is approximately $3 USD if you have your own 3D printer, and the printing time is roughly 8 hours.
 
It is not practical to download our 3D model from thingiverse and try to print it using a commercial 3D print service; the cost of such print would be extreme due to the processing time required. For example, a popular site shapeways would charge $125 USD to print it in plastic, with all characteristics of a 3D printed model as in the table above.
 


 
As with any object filled to a brim, we need to rotate it fast when pouring. The geometry of a ""spout"" in bakercube is (almost) as good as in a pouring pot, a product designed exclusively for pouring liquids.
Chamfered edges (vs rounded edges on thingiverse models) introduced to make bakercube compatible with the injection molding technology had a great side effect of improving the flow of liquids, seen in the video above.

There are countless definitions of a cup, and many people are very passionate about the subject, so we need to tread lightly.
In the US, two systems are used: the legal cup, 240 mL, used for all nutritional info we find on food packages and the customary cup, 236.58 mL, used for food recipes, unless they are specified in legal units, then we go back to 240 mL.
If you measure a cup of coffee in the US, it’s 118.3 mL, but don’t confuse it with the unit of a cup of water needed to prepare a cup of coffee, that’s 147.8 mL.
In many countries, a metric cup 250 mL is used. And no, it is not an official SI unit.
If you find yourself in Canada, their cup is 227.3 mL. Travel south to Latin America and it becomes 200 mL. If you visit Japan, their metric cup is 180.4 mL, but only for sake, otherwise it’s a 200 mL unit.
For those claiming superiority of the metric system, always a valid point, they need to examine closely measuring cups sold throughout Europe: 1 cup is 250 mL, 1/2 cup is 125 mL (or 120 mL), 1/3 cup is almost always 80 mL, and 1/4 cup is almost always 60 mL.
250 divided by 3 is never 80; 250 divided by 4 is not 60.
We had to start somewhere with our bakercube project; it would be impossible to release it in so many cup variations.
bakercube is based on the US legal system, with the metric conversion.1 legal cup = 240 mL.
The argument “the metric cup is 250 mL, not 240 mL” is not a valid one: bakercube uses the US legal cup, and not a metric cup (whatever that means, because metric cups come in different flavors, from 250 mL to  180 mL).
In the end, if you use bakercube to measure ingredients and they are specified in US legal, or customary, or metric or anything in-between, you simply end up with a bit more or a bit less of the final product, the ratios of ingredients should remain correct.
For the metric purists questioning a barely noticeable difference between the legal and the customary US units, please cut us some slack. After all, you accepted the formula of 4 x 60 mL = 250 mL used in metric cups, when 4 x 60 mL = 240 mL using the proper math.
If you require a high level of precision, it's always better to use a scale. Measuring by volume is affected by many factors, including your technique, the temperature and the humidity. bakercube is a great tool to have for recipes specified by volume, a standard for the US market.
Follow up products:
In the future, we plan to release other versions of bakercube:
minicube: starting at 1/2 cup | 3D model available on thingiverse today
maxicube: starting at 2 cups
metric only: 250 mL, 125 mL, 83.3 mL, 62.5 mL… for math majors and
metric only: 250 mL, 120 mL, 80 mL, 60 mL... following existing standards
metric only: 200 mL, 100 mL, 50 mL, 25 mL... for Latin America and Japan
minimetric: 125 mL, 100 mL, 75 mL, 50 mL...
US customary with and without mL conversion
For sake of simplicity and sanity, the US legal cup with the metric equivalents seems to be a perfect starting point for this project; it was the option chosen by 300+ of our friends on thingiverse who participated in our online survey.

We use 3D printed prototypes of bakercube in pictures and in the video; some pictures and renderings may feature an older version with rounded edges. We may still have to modify the final design to be compatible with the manufacturing technology of plastic injection.
bakercube perks will be manufactured with a high quality injection molding technology, using FDA food safe, dishwasher safe plastic. The rendering of bakercube above (in red color) shows the simulated look of the perks for this campaign. bakercube will be very smooth for easy cleaning; 3D printed prototypes shown on some pictures are quite rough. 
The design of the edge sections is chamfered as compared to rounded edges of 3D models on thingiverse to make it compatible with the injection molding technology and to improve the flow of liquids. This is the most recent design of the injection molding version (above), still subject to change.
Generally speaking, the changes between the thingiverse version and the one above are very small, and for most users these two objects will appear almost identical. The key changes are in the wall angles (due to the different limitations of those two technologies) and in the look of the edge section.
 

 

 

We worked as designers with several large companies. Some of the products we worked on are on sale in almost every country today. We have an extensive experience in product development, including all phases of manufacturing and fulfillment.
We are strong enthusiasts of 3D printing and we publish many 3d models anyone can download for free on thingiverse. The first version of bakercube is available there since Dec 2017.

This project will hit a few technical walls before it's manufactured, but we are confident we'll be able to handle production issues.
 

 
shipping | fees | taxesbackercube perks will be shipped by depositing the package with a tracking number at a Post Office. For domestic packages, the process is simple. For international packages, the receiving country may impose additional fees, like handling fees or taxes; if such fees or taxes are added, the backer receiving the perk will be solely responsible for the payment of such fees or/and taxes. notesbackercube is still under development and the final shape is subject to change to accommodate the requirements of the manufacturing process. Since we've been working on this project for 9+ months, it appears that we reached the final design... but nothing is final until we manufacture production dies, and we are not there yet. bakercube is a trademark of IOMAA LLC, Wyoming, USAbakercube is patent protected, USA and International. linksbakercube.com | www.bakercube.com | the future site for our sales of bakercubes, now forwarding to our page on thingiversebakercube on thingiverse | https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2676324Indiegogo this campaign | https://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/55fa5eefIndiegogo pre-launch page | https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bakercube-me... | sign-in pagetwitter | https://twitter.com/bakerscube | please follow for updates about bakercube project at twitter/bakerscube #bakercubepinterest | https://www.pinterest.com/bakercube/ | pinsfacebook | https://www.facebook.com/bakercube/ | follow us for updatespress photos | https://bit.ly/2xdnnQq emailspress contact: press@bakercube.comsupport: support@bakercube.cominfo: bakercube@gmail.com  videoproduct video music: ""Miami Nights - Extended Theme"" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) creditsvideo review of bakercube | Print 3D Channel | Jeffrey Wright | thank youvideo review of bakercube | Skylar Tisko | thank youvideo review of bakercube | 3D Printing Nerd | thank youvideo review of bakercube | Today 3D Print | Nerys | thank youvideo review of bakercube | Kickass 3D Prints |  thank youall videos showing 3D printing of bakercube by many thingiverse users | thank you #bakercube #bakercube #bakercube#bakercube #bakercube #bakercube#bakercube #bakercube #bakercube We are giving away prizes for media referrers to this site.RULES:step 1: Pitch bakercube to someone in the major media outlet listed below.step 2: Send an email to press@bakercube.com showing us the pitch you made or links to your own posts.step 3: When your pitch turns into a story or a broadcast, send a link to it to press@bakercube.comstep 4: We must receive your pitch submissions before 11:59PM EST on June 10th.

We'll make the final election of the manufacturer at the closing of the campaign based on the volume of bakercubes produced.Will you continue to offer free 3D models on thingiverse?Yes, we designed many 3D models before and after we posted bakercube on thingiverse; all of them are available there in a digital format to download free-of-charge. We will continue to upload our designs on thingiverse for others to enjoy.Why don't you post injection molded version of bakercube on thingiverse?All our 3D models on thingiverse can be printed without supports. When we use supports, the quality of the surface finish is compromised, there is a huge waste of material to generate supports and they are difficult to remove. The injection molded version of bakercube is not 3D print friendly and it doesn't belong on thingiverse; we posted a 3D print compatible versions of bakercube on thingiverse, and they print without any supports.",32.0,13,"1 Campaign

Do you worry about the effect of electronics on their health and addiction to television and phone games? Are they easily tired of toys? Relax, and learn how Aoland Magic Jungle solves all these problems! What is Magic Jungle? Magic Jungle is a set of toys that aims to bring children closer to animals and create a joyful experience shared with friends. The set, comprised of a magic wand and five animal characters, features multiple playing modes. Gently touch the heads of the animals with the magic wand and watch them light up. Switch on the sound mode to hear the animals sing, imitate real animal sounds, or play the music of a electronic piano and drum, creating the atmosphere of a carnival in a forest. No need to connect to a phone. No software to download. No toxic or harmful substances included.  Collaborated Media  Story Luo – Founder of Aoland, came up with the idea of connecting kids to the mother nature through this toy. He loves to travel and explore and was deeply moved by the wildlife in the rain forest when he visited the Amazon in 2016.“I was amazed by everything I saw in the jungle, unfortunately, I couldn’t take my daughter with me because she’s too young. Kids today have been living in the city for so long and barely have a chance to learn about wild animals. As a father and leader of a toy company, I really want to create a toy that can let kids get to know wildlife,” said Luo.Therefore, Luo started to work on the concept. He wanted to create a set of toys that can presents a jungle-like atmosphere.The first thing he thought about was sound. As a major sense of understanding the world, hearing can help children to feel the environment, animal sounds will help them to distinguish different animals in the jungle. For this reason, Luo decided to add the element of simulated animal sounds into the toy.Next, we brainstormed the other elements, from appearance and playing methods to the materials used. We carefully designed the toy to be child friendly and worked diligently to perfect the factors of sound, light, and form.""I really hope my daughter can stay close to nature, even if she is living in a modern city. Making friends with animals makes her kind and willing to protect the nature and animals. This is a common responsibility."" said Luo.After two-year hard work, the final sample is completed! We are so excited to launch our project on Indiegogo. We believe that your children will have a great time with these animal friends. All we need now is just a little support from you to make the magic happened. Elephant, Puppy, Piggy, Tiger, Chicken The animal theme motivates children’s kindness and curiosity. Under your child's command, with the help of the magic wand, these five animals can sing, imitate real animals sounds, and make sounds of electrical piano or drum, just like a carnival in a forest. They will become the perfect companion for your little one. To play with the toys, simply switch the sound modes by pressing the buttons on the magic wand: use the end to gently tap the animals on their heads to explore the jungle and the music! With the help of child-education specialists and designers, we finally choose these five animals: elephant, puppy, piggy, tiger, and chicken.​ Each animal represents a different attribute: 
Elephant – Happiness 
Puppy – Thankfulness  
Piggy – Excitement 
Tiger – Bravery 
Chicken – Encouragement These five animals can be lit at the same time, and of course, you can choose any of them to form a new combination. No need to fear darkness, darling!

Patented technology allows Muggino® to do this while conserving energy from waste heat.Muggino® keeps your drink just right, period. No fuss, no programming, hot remains hot, cold remains cold, and heat outside the range of optimum drinking is stored in the form of energy for later use.However, just as humans are different, so are their tastes. The MuggiApp™ has been exclusively designed for Muggino® in order to allow users to tune their preferences at will. HOW MUGGINO® WORKS?After you fill your mug with a hot tea or coffee, you can't immediately sip on it given the extreme temperature. As you wait for drinkable temperature, almost 1/3rd of energy deployed to heat your drink simply goes to waste. But Muggino® changes the game for better by smart harvest of this energy and uses it to charge up its battery. When the liquid reaches the user’s optimal temperature, Muggino® keeps it there using its agile thermoelectric heating system.And a similar process applies to cold beverages. The heart of Muggino® is thermoelectrics, a semiconductor material which converts temperature differences into electricity and vice versa. On a small scale, it's still a relatively nascent technology, but you'll find it in picnic coolers that plug into your car or seat coolers in luxury vehicles.                  (Schematic of a typical thermoelectric module - Credit: Amir Faraji)                  For more technical information visit www.muggino.com/technology KEY FEATURESAdvance cooling and heating systemAs one pours his beer into Muggino, the mug sensors would immediately gauge the temperature, with its control unit comparing it to his set temperature limit on the MuggiApp. If the drink’s temperature seems higher to the user’s favorite temperature, Muggino's advance cooling system starts working to cool down the beer and as it reaches to the needed temperature, Muggino keeps it there for long time.For hot beverages, if too hot, Muggino harvests what in any other mug is waste heat and converts it to electricity, and stores it in its battery.

The Qrio Smart Lock automatically locks the door when you go out.
By using the “Keyless Unlock” feature, your door will automatically unlock when you approach it. No more fishing around for your phone or keys!




 
Installation takes as little as five minutes. It’s super easy! The package includes multiple attachments for numerous types of thumb turn locks. Even when the Smart Lock doesn’t fit perfectly to your lock, the included bolt turner attachment can usually fill the gap.  


Your door lock is your first line of defense in home security. It’s important that a smart lock be sturdy, reliable and, most of all, safe!
The Qrio Smart Lock was built using the very best encryption technology Sony has to offer. 
This cutting edge technology ensures that the Qrio Smart Lock can only be operated by you and those you trust the most.  


  Sony’s information technology provides unprecedented security in addition to convenience.The Qrio Smart Lock is backed by Sony’s sophisticated encryption and two-factor authentication technology. And, you can keep track of every time the Smart Lock operates through an action log delivered to your phone - even if your door is manually unlocked with a physical key.   


With the Qrio Hub, you can monitor your door from anywhere in the world.
The Remote Unlock feature also allows you to lock and unlock your door from anywhere – great for letting friends and family check in on your pets while you’re away, or for emergency situations.


  Qrio has already sold 10,000 Smart Lock units in Japan.We always pledge timely delivery and we have the track record to prove it! Project Timeline Media list

<h2><b>                About the Inventors</b></h2>
<p>The Garden Thorn is the brain child of 6 inventors named ""The Steel Table Group"". Stan our inventor, got to talking to his father about his travels to Israel and noticed how well their agricultural industry was flourishing in the middle of the desert. A country that is a major exporter of exotic flowers and tropical fruits ""can’t happen by accident"" in the desert. As the group went back and forth, Dale mentioned that it would be necessary that the product attach to a hose with little or no tools involved, and Stan introduced the needle. The team then spent months upon months prototyping and testing numerous version until the Garden Thorn design and performance was perfected.</p>

Can this piece of technology help solve the world’s water problems?
With ongoing concerns about water shortage, and water usage, how can a water guzzling garden change it’s course?  This is WHY the Garden Thorn was invented.
Evaporation is essentially nothing with Garden Thorn's direct watering system, which eliminates water wastage. By watering directly to the roots, you will completely avoid the problem.
Water Runoff is completely eliminated by using the in-ground method that Garden Thorn has engineered. The Garden Thorn directly deals with this problem by injecting the water instead of traditional drip watering, 
Water Placement is precise with the Garden Thorn.  Brown tubing and soaker hoses expel water everywhere. This causes two problems, water saturation and water placement between plants in areas where water is not needed, causing you to waste valuable resources.

Assembly is simple with the Garden Thorn.  Traditional systems come with ongoing steps to set up their irrigation system. Garden Thorn has 2 steps, which cuts time drastically and saves you frustration.

Time Spent watering is cut drastically using the Garden Thorn.  Drip irrigation was designed to slowly release water and allow it to sink into soil to the roots of your plants.This often can take 30-60 minutes. By injecting the water, we estimate 2-3 minutes of watering time... What will this save on your water bill?
     How to install... in no time at all.

We already have our first mold and can produce thorns for our first backers. Manufacturing will be done by Handy Camel, a Kansas City based company.
We are also developing a  5/8th hose specifically for Garden Thorn with a highly respectable US hose manufacturer. A single membrane non leak hose, it is custom made to optimize the Garden Thorn's performance and still look attractive... Even though you cannot see it under mulch. Garden Thorn is offering a warranty for 24 months, only if it is used with the recommended hose.
Early backers will have perks delivered at the beginning of August with the remaining to be delivered in October.

Garden Thorn – Quality of Construction 

WHY is the thorn black? Because 100% recycled plastic is a massive component to the construction of Garden Thorn's main outer frame. We believe that in addition to water conservation, recycled plastic was the way to go with Garden Thorn.  If we can all work together to reduce water usage with Garden Thorn, we can certainly be environmentally friendly with the rest of the components.
Some production stages are hand made - for others, machinery is necessary to build the Garden Thorn with great quality, using the finest parts and components.

                About the Inventors
The Garden Thorn is the brain child of 6 inventors named ""The Steel Table Group"". Stan our inventor, got to talking to his father about his travels to Israel and noticed how well their agricultural industry was flourishing in the middle of the desert. A country that is a major exporter of exotic flowers and tropical fruits ""can’t happen by accident"" in the desert. As the group went back and forth, Dale mentioned that it would be necessary that the product attach to a hose with little or no tools involved, and Stan introduced the needle. The team then spent months upon months prototyping and testing numerous version until the Garden Thorn design and performance was perfected.

(Steel Table Group: Brian, Bob, Curt, Rich, Dale and Stan)

<h3>We have realized from this campaign that this product is not a product you purchase because you see it in an advertisement.  You purchase it when you are going directly to the store to buy a lock because you need one.  We must get this product on the shelves next to the old defective version.  It serves a great purpose and solves a common problem.    That is our mission and we will stop at nothing to make this happen.  We appreciate the support of our family and friends who came aboard without hesitation.  We will be refunding your money.  We would remove this campaign but Indiegogo has a rule that a campaign must run its course.

<h3>Ajust Lock</h3>
<p>Ajustco is a creative, product development company founded by Jason Stile (VP of Liu Electric), and Arman Rousta (CEO of Blueliner).  Arman has a degree from Columbia University and has successfully created and sold a popular invention in the past.  Blueliner is a cutting edge digital marketing firm also having a stake in Ajustco.  Other products are in the oven but we are currently putting all of our energy into Ajust Lock. </p>
<p>Our flagship product ""Ajust Lock"" is a practical solution to the common problem of lock misalignment.  This is caused by humidity, cold, or the settling of the structure.  Sometimes it is also the installation placing the lock offset right off the bat.  </p>
<p>The Ajust Lock is Flexible and has a tolerance which the current version of this lock does not.  If you install a barrel bolt just a few millimeters off, it often will not lock.  I am sure you have seen this time and again in a restaurant bathroom, shed, gate, bedroom door, stall door, and many other locations.  You often see holes everywhere where they have relocated the lock numerous times or you are holding the door with your foot to have some privacy.  I know, it's not fun. </p>

<p>We are ready to manufacture in China and this $15,000 will help us to get through the initial process and first batch.</p>
<p>We just had some samples made but we won't give the green light until we have a quality product.</p>

If you don't have much option of space, this will provide you the best solution as well.
                                   A short background, I am currently working overseas and brings me the need to fullfill this solution and build this new product, So this is what i have come up getting  mostly recycled materials to prove the design concept.

  Risks & Challenges Certain risk may involve is the re-production of the idea, whereby it would involve other 3rd party to source out the design. So this would be a challenge to further complete the design as intended. Mechanical design functions are fully shown as an intent to appreciate the overall mechanical design. This would also be a statement for of intellectual property ownership as the 1st publisher. Product trademark can be negotiated and discussed if others are interested.  Other Ways You Can Help Help us spread the word for the people who might be interested on the design and those who you think would like to support us. Thank you.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Meet ONELID </b><br/><br/>The only lid that is :</p>
<p><b>Universal</b> - will fit most of your pots (up to 22 cm/8.75"" diameter).</p>

<p><b>Has an integrated strainer</b> – draining a pot has never been easier or safer, just grab your pot or pan and pour.<br/><br/><b>Does not transfer heat </b>- even when boiling for extended amount of time the ONELID handle stays cool to the touch.  <br/><br/><b>Makes no sound</b> - soft on the outside - yet sturdy on the inside makes for safe handling and silent operation.</p>

<p>So, if you are like us, and would like to get your hands on one of the first ONELIDS, please sign up - and we will do our utmost to make your cooking experience easier, safer and more enjoyable for years to come. For a little more in-depth knowledge - please read on...  </p>

<h1>ONELID - HOW DOES IT WORK?</h1>
<p><b>SIZE - having trouble finding a lid to fit?</b></p>
<p>Not to mention the cacophony of noisy metal striking metal when desperately trying to find the right lid inside your kitchen cabinet? ONELID offers 4 ingenious features combined with great modern design in one elegant lid that will fit all your existing pots (up to 22 cm/8.75""). </p>
<p> </p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447719801/cof1jdxwbmntdykfd0c4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p><b>Ever experienced boiling over?</b></p>
<p>Depending on what you’re cooking, every pot will tend to over boil if you turn the heat up too high. The bigger the pot - the more steam is let out. ONELID greatly reduces this tendency by letting out just the right amount of excess steam. The intelligently designed grooves on the underside of ONELID are shaped to match the size of your pot and release just the right amount of steam to prevent over-boiling. Simple :) </p>

<p><b>Draining  - no more burned fingers or spilled pasta in your sink</b></p>
<p>Tired of burning your fingers on metal/glass lids during cooking or while pouring? Ever tried sliding your conventional lid a little to the side allowing that boiling water to drain, but ended up soaking your pot holders and getting peas and pasta into the sink? Yeah - who hasn’t! <br/><br/>Well no more. Because of the unique air-vents doubling as strainer (draining) holes, you now have trouble-free draining. ONELIDs silicone surface ensures great friction against the pot so your ONELID will stay centered and safe – even when held vertically. Your peas and pasta will remain in the pot where they belong.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447719803/vk2en0qe75y9irmzufah.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p>Perfect for casseroles too. The ONELID handle have taken many forms to reach this final design. ONELID now boasts superior ergonomics - both for 1 and 2-handle pots. And with a diameter of 23 cm/9"" ONELID will cover all you pots up to 3,5 liters. (covering 90-95 % of all private cooking). </p>
<p>Just check your old pot diameters before signing up. </p>

The world’s first truly universal multifunction lid that actually looks good and works like a dream. Once you try this - we promise you’ll never want to go back to using your old lids. Well maybe for drumming that is... ONELID was originally spawned by the ambition to make a lid that would minimize the risk of over boiling - but along the way we learned there were so many more annoying things related to the regular lids we use, like finding a lid that fits, burning hands and difficulties draining.  

Meet ONELID The only lid that is :
Universal - will fit most of your pots (up to 22 cm/8.75"" diameter).
Reduces over boiling -  intelligent groove system will let out just the right amount of excess steam.
Has an integrated strainer – draining a pot has never been easier or safer, just grab your pot or pan and pour.Does not transfer heat - even when boiling for extended amount of time the ONELID handle stays cool to the touch.  Makes no sound - soft on the outside - yet sturdy on the inside makes for safe handling and silent operation.
Danish Design at its best - we are pretty proud to have fit all these features into a design this modern, sophisticated and elegant.
Is dishwasher safe - naturally...
 
 
 
So, if you are like us, and would like to get your hands on one of the first ONELIDS, please sign up - and we will do our utmost to make your cooking experience easier, safer and more enjoyable for years to come. For a little more in-depth knowledge - please read on...  
 
ONELID - HOW DOES IT WORK?
SIZE - having trouble finding a lid to fit?
Not to mention the cacophony of noisy metal striking metal when desperately trying to find the right lid inside your kitchen cabinet? ONELID offers 4 ingenious features combined with great modern design in one elegant lid that will fit all your existing pots (up to 22 cm/8.75""). 
 
 
Ever experienced boiling over?
Depending on what you’re cooking, every pot will tend to over boil if you turn the heat up too high. The bigger the pot - the more steam is let out. ONELID greatly reduces this tendency by letting out just the right amount of excess steam. The intelligently designed grooves on the underside of ONELID are shaped to match the size of your pot and release just the right amount of steam to prevent over-boiling. Simple :) 
 
 
And you know the moisture that drips from your current lids onto the stovetop? ONELIDs patented convex underside ensures the drops that form will run back into your pot, so your stovetop stays cleaner.
 
 
Draining  - no more burned fingers or spilled pasta in your sink
Tired of burning your fingers on metal/glass lids during cooking or while pouring? Ever tried sliding your conventional lid a little to the side allowing that boiling water to drain, but ended up soaking your pot holders and getting peas and pasta into the sink? Yeah - who hasn’t! Well no more. Because of the unique air-vents doubling as strainer (draining) holes, you now have trouble-free draining. ONELIDs silicone surface ensures great friction against the pot so your ONELID will stay centered and safe – even when held vertically. Your peas and pasta will remain in the pot where they belong.
 
 
Perfect for casseroles too. The ONELID handle have taken many forms to reach this final design. ONELID now boasts superior ergonomics - both for 1 and 2-handle pots. And with a diameter of 23 cm/9"" ONELID will cover all you pots up to 3,5 liters. (covering 90-95 % of all private cooking). 
Just check your old pot diameters before signing up. 
 
 
If you are the ""I want to look inside type"" we are making a glass insert version 
ONELID with 3 mm Tempered glassHeat distribution - cool to the touch 
This FLIR-photo comparison shows how much better the heat distribution of ONELID works compared to a steel lid (and btw. glass lids are the same). Other than the hotter steam areas (away from the handles) the ONELID handle has the same temperature as the room and is barely affected by the boiling process within.

<p><b>The Material </b></p>
<p>We've given much thought and put in great care into the design of Le'Cook from the inside and out.  After rigorous research we found that the best internal structure/core for our Spoonula is Nylon material. Originally we had our heart set on stainless steel for its strength and durability; however, it was too heavy, absorbed too much heat, and was too bendable - not very practical attributes to serve our purposes. We decided that the nylon core is most suitable for our needs of creating a lightweight and easy to handle kitchen utensil. It also didn't absorb as much heat as other materials, which is ideal for our product. </p>

Why you need our spoonula

Wooden cooking tools can burn easily when rested too long on the side of a heated cooking pan. It tends to scratch the surface of cooking pan when you try to scrape the leftovers from the bottom.
Steel cooking tools can easily become scorching hot when left in contact with the surface of a heated pan for too long. Similarly, this material will easily leave scratch marks the surface of most cooking pans. 
Nylon cooking tools tend to melt when they reach certain temperatures if rested on the edge of your heated pan. Nylon material is also quite fragile and easy to chip.

The Story and Idea  
I love cooking and experimenting with recipes almost every day. As I was preparing dinner one evening, the usual problem arose when it came time for me to season and spice up my dishes - I didn't know where to rest my saucy spatula.That is when I start looking online for spoon rests and spatula holders.

However, this product still takes up room and needs to be cleaned separately after each use… “I wish there was a utensil that combines the pan spatula holder and the spatula itself - that would be amazing” ...the thought hit me!That was me about a year ago. From that day I made a lot of sketches and drawings trying to combine both cooking spatula and pan spatula holder into one solid high quality product, and that is when the idea of Le’ Cook Spoonula was born!

We have designed and printed a 3D prototype. Shortly after we produced a sample and tested the mock up in our kitchen to make sure the functionality of the hook and the material meets our standards.

We want the community's suggestions to help us make the Sobro Smart Side Table &amp; App an epic product and where possible, to incorporate the feedback into the final design.  </p><p>Launching on Indiegogo allows us to bring this product to market faster than we would be able to without the support of our backers. We hope that you will join us in bringing the Sobro Smart Side Table to life. </p><p> </p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><strong>Can I claim multiple perks?</strong></p><p>Yes, if you'd like to claim multiple perks, please make a new contribution for each perk.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What about shipping?</strong></p><p>As you can imagine, properly protecting and shipping your Sobro Smart Side Table is expensive.  The quotations we received so far have given us sticker shock. We don’t want the same to happen to you, so we are capping the maximum standard shipping charge at $29 and we will absorb the remainder. This will put the pressure on us to find the best methods available. Unfortunately, there will be an additional shipping charge for Canada, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. The shipping charge for these locations will be $89. For international customers, the shipping charge will be $119. Shipping will be available to the US, Canada, EU, UK, Switzerland and Norway. Please note this does not include any import/tax duties imposed by Canada as we have no control over these factors.</p><p>We have already started to work with our network of logistics partners and the one factor that substantially reduces the shipping cost is critical mass. Assuming this campaign gets the monstrous support that we are hoping for, we will be able to leverage multiple ports &amp; facilities in regions closer to our backers to reduce distance and, when shipping full truckloads, the costs plummet.  If we gain enough efficiency to bring the cost below $29.00, we will pass 100% of the savings through to the most important component of this campaign - our backers. So help us help you and please share this campaign with your friends, colleagues and anyone you think needs to step toward the future.</p><p> </p><p><strong>When can I expect a delivery?</strong></p><p>While the estimated delivery time frame is July 2019, certain factors may slightly delay the project. These include adding suggested features, improvements, obtaining appropriate certifications, and the time taken to clear customs. We will do our best to be as transparent as possible and keep you up to date on all developments. We want to make sure we deliver a quality product that you will enjoy and be proud of!</p><p> </p><p><strong>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</strong></p><p>You will receive a full refund after the campaign has ended. With your support and sharing the campaign with friends and family, we truly hope we can get over the finish line and beyond!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Does the Sobro Smart Side Table come with a warranty?</strong></p><p>Absolutely, we are just finalizing the details.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What happens if the project gets pushed back past the delivery date?</strong></p><p>With crowdfunding we are expected to deliver a product that can otherwise take years to deliver.

There may be certain setbacks beyond our control, which may delay the project. However, we will always be transparent and keep you all up to date!</p><p> </p><p><strong>What about colors?</strong></p><p>The Sobro Smart Side Table will be available in White, Black, and Wood finish should we meet our stretch goal of $1 million. The reason this is a stretch goal is we have to meet our manufacturers' minimum order quantities. If we exceed our fundraising goals, we may be able to create more finish options.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Will the Sobro Smart Side Table vary from the design above?</strong></p><p>While we have built the preliminary design and prototypes, we may still make some minor improvements. We love hearing from our supporters and if you have any suggestions we would be more than happy to consider them.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How can I choose my color?</strong></p><p>Everyone will have the option to select what color they would like after we reach our stretch goal of 1 million. This will be done in the form of a survey after the campaign has ended.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can I get a refund after the campaign has ended?</strong></p><p>The money raised here on Indiegogo will go into product design and development, purchasing of materials, manufacturing and the final delivery of your Sobro Smart Side Table. Refunds will only be issued if we can not deliver the final product after exploring all possible options. We will do our best to be transparent and keep you updated on all developments.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Will the Sobro Smart Side Table vary from the design above?</strong></p><p>While we have the preliminary design and prototypes built, we may still make some minor improvements.

Please note that wireless charging may not work on all phones. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What is the temperature of the cooler drawer?</strong></p><p>The temperature of the cooler will vary based on the environment temperature.

One table will serve as the ‘leading’ speaker and the second will connect via Bluetooth.</p><p> </p><p><strong>If a device has been synced and falls out of range, does it auto-reconnect when back in range?</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How big is the Sobro Smart Side Table?</strong></p><p>The table height is 18.5 inches, the width is 24 inches, and the depth is 19.2 inches.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What are the LED light colors?</strong></p><p>LED light bar on the bottom front side of the table is motion activated to guide you safely in the dark.

FOMO, it's the worst. They love us, they really love us. Designed for allSo many backers said that they wished that there was a smaller version of the Sobro Coffee Table, that we wanted to make sure that the Sobro Smart Side Table was a fit for everyone. It's compact enough to fit inside a 350 sq. ft. studio apartment in the East Village, yet roomy enough to hold a lot of stuff. Should you want the table to be taller, we will also make a ""Lift Kit"" available in 2 different heights. The Sobro Lift Kit legs are in development but will make the table 24"" or 29"", tall respectively.  Our Process We've been working hard to bring this product to life and this campaign to Indiegogo, here's a look behind the scenes into our design process...

We want the community's suggestions to help us make the Sobro Smart Side Table & App an epic product and where possible, to incorporate the feedback into the final design.  Launching on Indiegogo allows us to bring this product to market faster than we would be able to without the support of our backers.

We don’t want the same to happen to you, so we are capping the maximum standard shipping charge at $29 and we will absorb the remainder. This will put the pressure on us to find the best methods available. Unfortunately, there will be an additional shipping charge for Canada, Hawaii, Alaska, and Puerto Rico. The shipping charge for these locations will be $89. For international customers, the shipping charge will be $119. Shipping will be available to the US, Canada, EU, UK, Switzerland and Norway. Please note this does not include any import/tax duties imposed by Canada as we have no control over these factors.We have already started to work with our network of logistics partners and the one factor that substantially reduces the shipping cost is critical mass. Assuming this campaign gets the monstrous support that we are hoping for, we will be able to leverage multiple ports & facilities in regions closer to our backers to reduce distance and, when shipping full truckloads, the costs plummet.  If we gain enough efficiency to bring the cost below $29.00, we will pass 100% of the savings through to the most important component of this campaign - our backers. So help us help you and please share this campaign with your friends, colleagues and anyone you think needs to step toward the future. When can I expect a delivery?While the estimated delivery time frame is July 2019, certain factors may slightly delay the project.

You can also control the amount of time the light is on, the intensity (brightness) of the light, and the sensitivity level of the motion sensor within the Sobro app. Can I pair with my other Sobro devices?Up to 2 Sobro Smart Side Tables can be used for audio output. One table will serve as the ‘leading’ speaker and the second will connect via Bluetooth. If a device has been synced and falls out of range, does it auto-reconnect when back in range?Yes. How big is the Sobro Smart Side Table?The table height is 18.5 inches, the width is 24 inches, and the depth is 19.2 inches. What are the LED light colors?LED light bar on the bottom front side of the table is motion activated to guide you safely in the dark.

<p></p><p></p></div>","As of today, 65% of the world population can not access the Internet. This means that a wide number of people is unable to exchange information, discover the world or improve his culture and knowledge.Are you ready for the Crowd Communicating era?To fight the digital divide, we have started to work on a brand new telecommunication standard. We focused on the possibility to reuse cheap and well-known devices such as smartphones and mini-PCs.We want to make each device to take part in both exchanging data and computing it.The ideaOur idea is to turn any wi-fi-capable device into a peer, allowing a wide number of peers to get interconnected each other. This would mainly work as the human brain, where each node stores and computes information, then transmits it back. The more peers, the fastest and more efficient network.In this way, areas with a large population density will be automatically provided with a completely free wi-fi based data connection. ConceptThe concept behind this is simple and based on the following assumptions:
smartphones, tablet, PCs and mini-PCs already come with a built-in WiFi, Bluetooth or NFC connectivity module.
The population density in a specific area gives both the size of bandwidth need and the availability of interconnectable devices.
Human artifacts could host additional networking-capable smart devices (cars, trains, buildings, traffic lights, …), such as mini-PCs or used/legacy smartphones that would have been thrown away.
What about Telecom Operators?Telecom Operators are not out-of-the-game: they will play an important role by focusing on long-distance and large-bandwidth links. Smart devices are also connected to standard Internet gateways, such as modems, to bridge the Crowd Communicating networks with the Internet. How can you contribute?We started to work on this project on our spare time, this way will take too long. We have decided to involve the Company we are working for (Gruppo MAASI) that accepted by providing time and resources. Unluckily this is not sufficient yet, and we need money to pay for prototypes, researches and consultancies.Your money we will receive are required to:
buy mini-PCs and refurbished smartphones of many different vendors that will be used for testing
buy markets database access (eg: wifi-capable devices specifications, market penetration etc)
buy experts consultancies (telecommunication engineers, legal advisers for country-related regulations etc)

We are all just your average working class citizens in the Greater-St. Louis area. We have no children, one cat, and we all love each other very much. We are all currently in school, or graduated, and let me tell ya, we go through a lot of clothes. Our new apartment does not come with a Washer and Dryer, so we need your help!   What We Need & What You Get So we need a washer and dryer: 
It must accommodate all four of us (including the cat) It must accommodate for 1 female resident, which is double the amount the 3 gentlemen together will use it.  Every penny raised will be used towards the purchase of our washer and dryer. 
Each donor will have their name written on the washer and dryer with a sharpie, and a photo will be posted on Facebook. 
  The Impact We feel that there are major impacts for purchasing this washer and dryer: 
Fresh, clean clothes provide safer working environments for us, and our co-workers. Clean laundry allows clothes to be folded and put away neatly, which is better for our environment. Today's society is more accepting to people with clean, fresh clothes rather than people with dirty clothes.
Everyone living together will get along if we all are wearing fresh clean clothes.
If you ever stay the night, you may use the washer and dryer as well (accommodations for personal detergent must be made). 
  Risks & Challenges  There are a few risks and challenges if we don't meet our goal: 
Being unable to purchase a washer and dryer will lead to laundry buildup. Eventually we will run out of clean clothes entirely.
First our social life will be impacted, then our careers.
Smelly clothes lead to loss of job, which will result in eviction.

<li>We believe that providing low to moderate income renters with affordable housing opportunities results in a healthier and more sustainable neighborhood. <br/>
</li> <li>Our first project is located in an historic neighborhood outside of the downtown core in Roanoke, VA. The neighborhood has suffered in the past with mis-management of rental properties and general deterioration of both the homes and the neighborhood atmosphere. </li>
<li>Our goal is to perform a high-quality rehabilitation of one of the neighborhood's most dilapidated homes in order to provide affordable rental housing to the area. </li> <li>We are just $5,000 shy of meeting our funding goals to acquire our first property and begin our rehabilitation. Here's where you come in...</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Restoration Housing's Goals &amp; Your Role</h3> <ul> <li>We're very close to meeting our goal to purchase our first home and only need an additional $5,000 in order to make the acquisition. Once the home is purchased, our nonprofit will use a combination of historic tax credits and local grants to begin the construction loan process and get our work started!</li> <li>If we can't meet our goal of $5,000 on IndieGoGo, we will continue to pursue other grants and monetary contributions throughout the community until we can afford to purchase our first property. </li>
<li>We are determined to get this project up and moving in the very near future and would love to include you in the process! Even the smallest donation counts...</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact of Historic Rehabilitation &amp; Affordable Housing</h3> <ul> <li>Not only will this project help to reduce vacancy and blight, it will provide affordability in an area that is quickly becoming less and less affordable. Our goal is to rehab this home and provide rental units for tenants that earn 50% of the area's median income. </li> <li>Our projects strive to promote an appreciation for the history and integrity of a neighborhood and its surrounding community.

We believe that providing low to moderate income renters with affordable housing opportunities results in a healthier and more sustainable neighborhood. 
 Our first project is located in an historic neighborhood outside of the downtown core in Roanoke, VA. The neighborhood has suffered in the past with mis-management of rental properties and general deterioration of both the homes and the neighborhood atmosphere. 
Our goal is to perform a high-quality rehabilitation of one of the neighborhood's most dilapidated homes in order to provide affordable rental housing to the area.  We are just $5,000 shy of meeting our funding goals to acquire our first property and begin our rehabilitation. Here's where you come in...
   Restoration Housing's Goals & Your Role  We're very close to meeting our goal to purchase our first home and only need an additional $5,000 in order to make the acquisition. Once the home is purchased, our nonprofit will use a combination of historic tax credits and local grants to begin the construction loan process and get our work started! If we can't meet our goal of $5,000 on IndieGoGo, we will continue to pursue other grants and monetary contributions throughout the community until we can afford to purchase our first property. 
We are determined to get this project up and moving in the very near future and would love to include you in the process! Even the smallest donation counts...    The Impact of Historic Rehabilitation & Affordable Housing  Not only will this project help to reduce vacancy and blight, it will provide affordability in an area that is quickly becoming less and less affordable. Our goal is to rehab this home and provide rental units for tenants that earn 50% of the area's median income.  Our projects strive to promote an appreciation for the history and integrity of a neighborhood and its surrounding community. Roanoke, Virginia is the childhood home of Restoration Housing's founding director and it holds a very special place in her heart. We hope to make Roanoke a better place to live for all of its citizens and all of its neighborhoods. 
We believe that all of our work should reflect our desire for a better social and cultural environment for future generations and we're confident that our work will have a lasting and positive effect on the community.

The Science and Engineering behind the Enerzator is well-established; the design is innovative.The Need and Demand for Something Like the Enerzator
R744 is refrigerant-grade, high-purity, carbon dioxide with a moisture content of less than 10 parts per million.  It has the kind of chemical properties that make the Enerzator possible.Here Are Just a Few of the Many R744.com Partner Companies [Enerzator is not claiming association w/R774.com nor their partners]
We are listing these so that you get the idea about the Enerzator's potential (there are many more R744 partner companies than listed here.)Why the Enerzator Works
With the right kind of gas, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), and an efficient system, it does not take much temperature differential to produce energy.  For example, with a camper propane refrigerator just a small flame produces the required energy (as per picture of flame housing below.) Because CO2 boils (!) at -70.6 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees C) it will ""steam"" and create pressure (practically anywhere in the world), which can be turned into energy at very low cost.  In other words:1. Steam engines work2. CO2 boils practically anywhereTherefore, a device can be designed and built that takes advantage of ambient temperature to produce energy.How the Enerzator WorksThe Enerzator is basically a steam engine plus super efficient heat pump that takes advantage of carbon dioxide's (CO2) properties (R744) to produce very green energy.  Bear in mind that CO2 is a major air waste product (cheap.)""A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source 
of heat to a destination called a ""heat sink"". Heat pumps are designed 
to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat 
from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one, and vice-versa."" [Wikipedia]For the technically inclined, here is an example of a propane refrigeration drawing.What Is So Great About the Enerzator?It is important that you recognize this as an example of a ""breakthrough"" innovation where the principles are so well-known that people simply haven't thought about applying them in a different way.  When people think steam engines, they think 18th and early 19th Centuries.  The Enerzator uses advance technology components but powerful ""old-fashioned"" principles.Planned Model Specs and Design Details
The Team    Royce Hamer is  a Mechanical Engineer with particular expertise in rotating equipment.  He  holds 4 inter-provincial certifications and has been awarded about 8 Industrial Designs (similar to a patent.)  Royce has a successful history of improving on technology and developing new concepts.  He has been interested in energy-efficient design for many years.Royce started researching energy efficiency about seven years ago when he worked in the oil and gas industry.  He started serious work on the design of the Enerzator about three years ago, investing time and a considerable sum of his own monies.Vlad Gouzenko has worked as a project manager and systems engineer for several companies with responsibilities relating to mechanical and industrial engineering.   Funding Goal
We asking for $ 70,000.00 in order to get the product design 
finalized and produce the Model ZP002.  Then fund an awareness campaign and move into marketing and production.All funds will be used for expenses and to retain qualified outside assistance.  The principals will not receive compensation until the project is profitable.  We are doing this because it is an important cause.As we move forward we will go to hire very 
talented individuals to master the assembly lines and to develop new 
devices for large industry and to miniaturize the units for portable 
personal devices. Serious donations will receive vouchers equal or greater in value matching the donation. This is part of our belief system ( the price of giving
 is receiving). We cannot easily do this without your help.Great PerksWould you like to have had first dips on the Tesla car (e.g. check what's happened to the value of their stock)?  If you missed that, now you have a chance with the Enerzator(tm) ZPP Green Energy System!  Remember, people were talking about electric cars for a long time, before Elon Musk got it done the right way.  Wouldn't it be fun if you had received a t-shirt proving that you were one of the early Tesla cars supporters?   Risks & Challenges  During the funding and support phase we expect considerable skepticism because of the negative associations people have about radical energy innovations.  For example, Zero Point Energy is a physical reality that has been presented in both positive and negative ways.Furthermore, when the Enerzator starts large-scale production, we expect competitors to act fiercely because of the general impact this technology can have.  For example, we plan to develop very basic and simple units that can be build in a home workshop.  Other Ways You Can Help We do not wish to create a lot of publicity at this time as the R744 market has been drawing a lot of attention and we are a start-up.  We are vulnerable to those who (1) have their own, inferior products and/or (2) prefer to control the dissemination of efficient energy products.  You can help by passing the word of this project to potential donors and be aware that we reward those who help others with no expectations.",10.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The home accommodates and cares for more than 150 children that are orphaned (often from parents suffering from illnesses related to HIV and AIDS), sick and poverty stricken, many of whom are refugees fleeing persecution in Burma. Every day we aim to give these forgotten border children a safe and healthy future.<br/></span></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Project</h3> <p></p>In a place where sunshine is plentiful, but reliable, clean and safe water is not, there is one very simple solution. <br/><p></p>
<div>
<p>Harnessing
 the natural energy of sunlight to generate power and provide running 
water is certainly not a new concept, yet it will undoubtedly 
revolutionize the lives and futures of the children here at Baan Unrak. 
With bountiful sunlight and a huge reservoir on our doorstep, natural 
resources are plentiful and are waiting to be utilized. <span>To make clean and reliable running water for the children here a reality we will install solar
 panels at the farm to power the two existing solar pumps which were 
generously donated and kindly received. </span></p>
<p><span>Our
 home in Sangkhlaburi is stationed on a hill; a large reservoir is 
situated at the foot of the hill.  The reservoir is potentially a healthy
 source of water for our home.  However, since our home is situated at a
 height above the reservoir, water has to be pumped upwards, which has 
always been a challenge given the unstable electricity supply that we 
receive from the grid.  As our home is located within a natural 
surrounding that receives sufficient sunlight all year round, 
solar-powered water pumps running on electricity generated by solar 
panels provide a means to receive a steady supply of water from the reservoir. </span><span><span><span>The water will be transported 
from the reservoir to the house through a series of pipes and be stored 
in a water pond which will be able to store 50,000 liters of water. </span>
 The operation of solar powered pumps is also more economical mainly due
 to the lower operation and maintenance costs, and they have a lesser 
impact on the environment.</span></span></p>
<p>To be able to implement this efficient, cost effective and environmentally sound system we need:</p>
<p><b>40x 280w solar panels (12,000 THB or $365 each)</b></p>
<p>The
 benefits of this system go beyond simple running water for the children
 to drink. Clean, running water will improve sanitation and hygiene, 
preventing sickness and giving the children a clean and safe environment
 in which to live and thrive. Extra labour to collect the water will be 
reduced, saving valuable time and resources leaving more available for 
essentials such as food and education.</p>
<p>For
 children who have come from some of the most uncertain pasts, turning 
on a tap and being sure that water will flow would bring emotional and 
practical stability. Reliable water is a building block to a safe and 
secure future. Whether your donation buys a whole panel or just part, 
you will be helping to bring certainty, stability, water and light to 
many children who began their lives in uncertainty and darkness.</p>
<p>The
 natural resources are ready, and so are we. Now we just need you to 
help us harness it. Don’t wait until tomorrow because Here Comes the 
Sun.</p>

</div></div>","Baan Unrak Baan Unrak “Home of Joy”, is a children’s home and community development project in Sangkhlaburi, Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand. The home accommodates and cares for more than 150 children that are orphaned (often from parents suffering from illnesses related to HIV and AIDS), sick and poverty stricken, many of whom are refugees fleeing persecution in Burma. Every day we aim to give these forgotten border children a safe and healthy future.   
    The Project In a place where sunshine is plentiful, but reliable, clean and safe water is not, there is one very simple solution. 

Harnessing
 the natural energy of sunlight to generate power and provide running 
water is certainly not a new concept, yet it will undoubtedly 
revolutionize the lives and futures of the children here at Baan Unrak. 
With bountiful sunlight and a huge reservoir on our doorstep, natural 
resources are plentiful and are waiting to be utilized. To make clean and reliable running water for the children here a reality we will install solar
 panels at the farm to power the two existing solar pumps which were 
generously donated and kindly received. 
Our
 home in Sangkhlaburi is stationed on a hill; a large reservoir is 
situated at the foot of the hill.  The reservoir is potentially a healthy
 source of water for our home.  However, since our home is situated at a
 height above the reservoir, water has to be pumped upwards, which has 
always been a challenge given the unstable electricity supply that we 
receive from the grid.  As our home is located within a natural 
surrounding that receives sufficient sunlight all year round, 
solar-powered water pumps running on electricity generated by solar 
panels provide a means to receive a steady supply of water from the reservoir. The water will be transported 
from the reservoir to the house through a series of pipes and be stored 
in a water pond which will be able to store 50,000 liters of water. 
 The operation of solar powered pumps is also more economical mainly due
 to the lower operation and maintenance costs, and they have a lesser 
impact on the environment.
To be able to implement this efficient, cost effective and environmentally sound system we need:
40x 280w solar panels (12,000 THB or $365 each)
The
 benefits of this system go beyond simple running water for the children
 to drink. Clean, running water will improve sanitation and hygiene, 
preventing sickness and giving the children a clean and safe environment
 in which to live and thrive. Extra labour to collect the water will be 
reduced, saving valuable time and resources leaving more available for 
essentials such as food and education.
For
 children who have come from some of the most uncertain pasts, turning 
on a tap and being sure that water will flow would bring emotional and 
practical stability. Reliable water is a building block to a safe and 
secure future. Whether your donation buys a whole panel or just part, 
you will be helping to bring certainty, stability, water and light to 
many children who began their lives in uncertainty and darkness.
The
 natural resources are ready, and so are we. Now we just need you to 
help us harness it. Don’t wait until tomorrow because Here Comes the 
Sun.
