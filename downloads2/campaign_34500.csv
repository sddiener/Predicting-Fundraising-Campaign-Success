<h3>""Project: Unity"" A Bullying Prevention Program by The Runway to Hope Foundation.</h3>
<p>Bullying has become one of our world's leading social issues, leaving countless teens turning to suicide as an irreversible conclusion to the life they have been told wasn't good enough.  According to statistics taken in 2010, around 71% of the student population report being bullied on a consistent basis. This number can only be stated as unmentionable in today's world because over 2/3 of those students feel the school systems are <b>NOT</b> responding properly.  </p>
<p>How have we, as advanced as our world has become, subjecting our children to such hate, anger, and worthlessness when not a single one of us is better than the next?  Why are we continuously advocating our educational standards towards higher learning, when we can't even allow the next generation to feel as though their true talents are good enough to apply to the real world?  What has brought us to think that any one of us have been given the right to repress the natural well-being and happiness of any other being?<br/></p>
<p>To the people of our world: It's been long enough. It is time to finally put an <b>END </b>to bullying in every single way. Due to the unfortunate use of technology, it has made it much easier for students to bully each other because words in text are utilized more than words in voice. Besides that, the measures taken by our school districts focus on the differences between our students, rather than creating a medium channel of equality. There are many programs and ""laws"" within our states that take the exact same approach to bullying as what was seen decades ago, and they are obviously not producing ANY sort of positive outlook or change. Anyone can state that there is growth happening on the field of bullying, but when even as recent as last week, a 12 year old girl threw herself off of a building to her death because of it, I would like to aggressively disagree with any and ALL of our educational institutions standpoint. </p>
<p>So please, we are begging you: Read forward to see exactly how we can finally bring this global pandemic of inequality to it's necessary demise. </p>
<p>The Runway to Hope Foundation is a non-profit company based out of the North East United States. We are a group of individuals that have realized the world that society has created for our new generation is not aimed towards peace or individual self-worth. Therefore, in order to start moving in the right direction, we have begun to introduce our new bullying prevention program, Project: Unity. I say bullying PREVENTION instead of Anti-Bullying because it's time to put an end to the hate before it even begins.</p>
<p>The overall goals and mission behind Project: Unity are to foster the TRUE individuality of each and every student, because is it not psychologically proven to think that if each person could love themselves, they could love each other? Wouldn't it be right to say that if each person was given the opportunity to excel and embrace their own unique traits, we could all co-create peace within the school environments?</p>
<p>Project: Unity takes an innovative look at bullying by beginning to unify school atmospheres through creativity, music, individualized skills, and a universal philosophy of positive self-esteem. Not only does the program offer the necessary mediation services, documentation, and reporting of bullying situations that are required by the state, but we have also developed various programs that will allow our students to embrace the life they were born to live. We also aim to offer FREE outlets of psychological support through Music Therapy, Art Therapy, Chromotherapy, Heliotherapy, Animal Therapy, Group Physical Activity (Hula Hooping, Dance, etc.), and Self-Motivational Exercises.</p>

It lists the various programs and services that can be enacted IF we all stand together to bring the change we NEED for our children.   </p>
<p>Due to the fact that our school districts are low on budgeting and funds, it is imperative to come together as communities of the world so that we may offer these extremely necessary programs to our students. We are looking for ANY donation or contribution that can assist us in the end result of peace.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><em><strong>Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Risk - It's Not All About BRCA1 and BRCA2</strong></em></p>
<p>Each year, tens of thousands of women are genetically tested for mutations in two Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer genes, called <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>.  When present, a mutation in one of these genes can dramatically increase the lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer.  Most often, these women end up pursuing genetic testing because of a personal and/or family history of breast or ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>For women from families in which one or more people are known to have a mutation, the genetic test can clarify whether they <em>did not</em> inherit the known mutation in the family (and therefore have cancer risks typical for the general population) or <em>did</em> inherit the known familial mutation (which can allow them to make proactive decisions about managing and reducing their cancer risk).</p>
</div>
<div>Overall, about 80 to 90 percent of women who are tested for mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">do not</span> have a mutation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><em>Lost in the focus on women and families with mutations are the tens of thousands of women (hundreds of thousands?) with a substantial personal/family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer where genetic testing has not revealed a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation explaining the clustering of cancer in the family.</em></strong></div>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">These ""BRCA Negative"" women and families are the focus of this campaign.</span></p>
<p>I know from experience - both in the clinic and interactions online - that a significant number of these women and families continue to actively search for an explanation for what can be a substantial history of cancer in their families.  In many cases, we may never know; however, for a subset of these women, the last 15 years of cancer genetics research have yielded other genes that may be relevant to their families.</p>
<div><strong><em><br/></em></strong></div>
<div><strong><em>Our Knowledge of Other Genes Involved in Hereditary Breast and/or Ovarian Cancer Risk is Growing Every Year</em></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Over the last two decades, steady research progress has led to the identification of a growing list of genes that can be responsible for breast or ovarian cancer risk within a family.  Most are uncommon, but they have the potential to be very meaningful for the subset of BRCA Negative families that they impact. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For some of these risk genes (for example: <em>TP53</em>, <em>PTEN</em>, <em>MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, CDH1</em>, <em>STK11</em>, and others), there are certain personal/family history clues that may suggest that they could be relevant to a particular family.  For others (<a href=""http://cancerandyourgenes.com/2010/04/rad51c-a-new-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-gene.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""RAD51C - A New Hereditary Cancer Gene""><em>RAD51C</em></a> and <a href=""http://cancerandyourgenes.com/2011/08/rad51d-a-new-hereditary-ovarian-cancer-gene.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""RAD51D - A New Hereditary Ovarian Cancer Gene""><em>RAD51D</em></a>, for example), family histories in families with mutations are generally similar to those considered for testing for <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> mutations.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<em><strong>Marked Improvements in ""Next-Generation Sequencing"" Technology are Leading to a New Generation of Genetic Tests for Cancer Risk that Can Assess 10-20 Genes</strong></em><strong> Simultaneously in a Much More Cost-Effective Manner<br/></strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Impressive new sequencing technologies are beginning to be deployed in clinical diagnostics laboratories.  They have the potential to change both the logistics and economics of testing for mutations in multiple cancer risk genes simultaneously.  Thus, it will be increasingly feasible to test appropriate individuals from BRCA negative families with substantial breast or ovarian cancer histories for mutations in other cancer risk genes (even if the chance of a mutation in each of those genes ranges from just a few percent to a fraction of a percent).</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><em><strong>Why I Decided to Create The BRCA Negative Book - a Guide to New Information Relevant to BRCA Negative Women and Families</strong></em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>As a clinical cancer geneticist with board certification in both Clinical Genetics and Internal Medicine, my career has been focused on studying, understanding, assessing, and communicating information about inherited cancer risk - both in the clinic and via online educational efforts.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since 2007, I've focused increasingly on using the internet as a tool to communicate information.  This has included:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Writing online about the genetics of cancer risk at <a href=""http://www.cancerandyourgenes.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""CancerAndYourGenes.com"">CancerAndYourGenes.com</a> since 2007</li>
<li>Founding <a href=""http://evinome.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Evinome Website"">Evinome</a> to educate and spread important information related to inherited cancer risk and cancer genetics to people regardless of geography or ability to pay for healthcare in the physical world</li>
<li>Launching <a href=""http://BRCAscoop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""BRCAscoop - High Quality BRCA1 and BRCA2 Information"">BRCAscoop.com</a> in 2011 to provide high quality health information and education to the hundreds of thousands (and millions worldwide) of women and men with <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> mutations</li>
<li>Developing CancerGeneticsPro - a useful curated newsletter source of state-of-the-art clinical cancer genetics information for both physicians without genetics training who order genetic testing in their practices and genetic counselors</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Over the last few years, it has become clear that a convergence of several trends underscores the need for this book:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing is fairly widespread in the developed world.  Regardless of geography or access to genetics professionals, patients are being getting tested...and in most cases, the answer is that a mutation does not appear to be causing breast/ovarian cancer risk in their family.</li>
<li>There is a broad trend towards individuals taking increasing responsibility in their own care by accessing high quality information resources (online resources, books, etc.)</li>
<li>There is a growing list of genes that explain risk in a subset (small but growing) of BRCA Negative families. </li>
<li>The proliferation of new sequencing technologies in clinical labs is already beginning to make it more feasible to sequence most or all of these genes in appropriately selected families.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The BRCA Negative Book</em> will detail, in lay terms, the following: (1) The key family history clues that may point to other genetic syndromes involving breast or ovarian cancer risk; (2) The sequencing technology advances that will increasingly open up other testing options for BRCA Negative families with a substantial family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer; (3) A realistic view of the likelihood of further testing making a difference for ones family; and (4) Concrete useful suggestions for getting further information.</p>

<h3 dir=""ltr"">Our program and passion:</h3>
<p dir=""ltr"">The mission of Earth Explorers is to open doors to science and engineering careers by educating and mentoring underrepresented youth. We define <em>underrepresented</em> as girls, minorities, students living in poverty, students who will be among the first generation in their families to attend college, and people with disabilities. We use video and new media technology to connect young people to science and engineering professionals in their communities, and to deepen networks of resources that will help our students succeed beyond the classroom.</p>

Our program and passion:
The mission of Earth Explorers is to open doors to science and engineering careers by educating and mentoring underrepresented youth. We define underrepresented as girls, minorities, students living in poverty, students who will be among the first generation in their families to attend college, and people with disabilities. We use video and new media technology to connect young people to science and engineering professionals in their communities, and to deepen networks of resources that will help our students succeed beyond the classroom.

<p class=""Standard""><span>PDI is a community-based NGO that was founded by David and Elizabeth Zaale in the Bududa district of Uganda. The Zaales have developed several different programs to help improve the lives of the people in their community, one of which is a nursery school that focuses on giving children a head start in their English skills. The Bududa area is known for its lacking education system and the Zaales are trying to address the problem early by starting with the youngest in the community. They also have plans for an after school program to help the older children already in school with their English skills.</span></p>
<p class=""Standard"">PDI was making great strides in improving education until this May when the two-room school building that the nursery school classes were being held in, was taken back by the landlord, torn down, and turned into a new secondary school. Because of this, the Zaales were forced to move the nursery school classes into their own home and put the plans for the after school program on hold. Their home does not have adequate space for all of the children, and having them there every day has become a huge burden on the family.</p>
<p class=""Standard""><span>Fortunately, before the old school was torn down, PDI had already purchased land and started construction on a new, bigger school building down the road. Initially, the school was being built a little at a time as the funds became available, but with the recent turn of events this is no longer an option. Getting this new school done has become a major priority for the Zaales, and we have the opportunity to help this community in a big way!</span></p>

<p>The Liahona Education Center has provided a huge service and blessed the lives of many children living in the surrounding community who otherwise would not receive an education. The growth that the school has seen has been incredible, but with so much growth, and limited funds, problems arise. One concern expressed by the Butalis is the school’s inadequate restroom facilities. Right now, the school has two pit latrines that are in bad shape and are quickly crumbling from termite damage.

<p>Because we have been so impressed with the service the Butalis have given, and the work that they have put in to make their school so successful, our team wants to be able to give back to them. We have decided to help them raise the money necessary to build five new pit latrines – two for girls, two for boys, and one for staff. Latrines can be relatively expensive to construct and, once again, we don’t have the money within our budget to do it ourselves. In addition to the new latrines, we would love to provide this school with a water catchment system to more easily provide their students with clean water on a daily basis.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.""</p>

<h2>'A Place to Be': Make Friends, Have Fun, Be Yourself!</h2>
<p>When 'A Place to Be' was launched nearly three years ago, my daughter, now 25, made me aware of a growing epidemic in our communities. Month after month for three years, I was hearing about youth in our communities in Essex County, Massachusetts, that were overdosing on drugs and committing suicide at an alarming rate. I knew that something was terribly wrong. It was then that I decided to launch GenYLife Design (pronounced 'Jen Why Life Design'), and become an advocate for at-risk youth in Generation Y. <a href=""http://www.genylifedesign.com/about_us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.genylifedesign.com/about_us</a></p>
<p>Initially, I invested $10,000 of my own money, and also raised another $28,000 from a generous family member, and one patron who believed in me, and our cause. This was in February of 2010. Within two months of launch, our first program was funded by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts--a pre-vocational program co-sponsored by The Boys and Girls Clubs. Since then, we've grown our budget to $135,000 a year <em><strong>solely</strong></em> through state funding. This has has made it possible for us to provide year-round, out-of-school time programs to disadvantaged youth with social, emotional and behavioral issues, in several under-served communities in Massachusetts, including Lawrence, Haverhill, Gloucester and Salisbury.</p>
<p><strong><em>Why we need your help.</em></strong> The Commonwealth of MA has been good to us, and helped get us launched. We're grateful! However, just recently, we learned that our prime funding source at the state level is changing how they fund their Youth Support Programs. This means, we can no longer afford to operate the quality of programming we've built our reputation on-- given the new rate and payment structure. In addition, the eligibility requirements for our kids to be funded by this state program are eliminating many deserving kids from the state's approved program roster--including some kids who we've served for over two years. <strong><em>What may appear to be a challenge to others is an opportunity in disguise to us!</em></strong> </p>
<h3>Our Mission and Programs</h3>
<p><em><strong>The focus of our programs is two-fold:</strong> </em>First, we help our kids make friends, learn to socialize (without the use of electronics!), and navigate issues such as bullying and cyber-bullying before these incidences cause damage. Second, through one-on-one Personal Coaching/Mentoring, we guide our kids to discover what they're passionate about and do naturally and well. We call this their 'WOW Factor'.

<h3>We're Looking for 100 Angels Who Will Help 'A Place to Be' Empower Youth This Fall!</h3>
<em><strong>With your help, we can now offer our programs to ALL kids that fit our profile--regardless of their state eligibility.</strong></em> To do this, we need 100 Angels who will help us raise approximately $44,000 to keep our program going into 2013. That's 100 Angels (friends and family) referring the campaign to 10 prospective donors that make a contribution of $44 each. That's all we need to reach our goal....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This will provide a bridge of funding so our kids don't have a gap in programming this fall. It will also give us time to apply for other state funding and grants with our partner nonprofit, The Salvation Army.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With your generous support, our kids will continue to have 'A Place to Be' where they feel safe, loved, hopeful about the future, and appreciated for who they truly are--without labels or stigma from past incidences or behavior. <em><strong>Once the campaign has ended, The Salvation Army in Haverhill, MA, a non-profit, 501c(3) organization, will receive a donation from GenYLife Design to administer the funds raised, and support 'A Place to Be' programming. This means your donations are be tax deductible.</strong> </em>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong><em>Whether we reach our goal of $44,000 or not by October 8th (and we're confident we will),</em> <em>we'll offer our programs, regardless. We can do this on a less frequent basis if need be, with whatever funds we raise. </em></strong>With one afternoon a week of programming, we would collaborate with Valleyworks Career Center to help our kids, ages 16-18, gain the job skills they need to become employed, more independent young adults. Our younger youth would work one-on-one with a Personal Coach on an empowering, self esteem-building project to help them take their next steps. This is our commitment!<strong><em><br/></em></strong></p>

<p><strong><strong>Olivia, Age 15, Emerging Artist<br/></strong></strong></p>
<p>Olivia is a gifted artist, and knows what she wants. Working closely with her Personal Coach at 'A Place to Be,' Olivia created a portfolio of her pen and ink drawings, and targeted several galleries where she wanted to show her work. All three galleries accepted her work, including Cameleon in Newburyport, and The Sage Gallery and Artist's Cafe in Haverhill. Olivia has already sold four of her framed pieces just since the beginning of August! Her art career is launched! (See a photo of Olivia at her first art opening in August in our gallery.)</p>
<p><strong>Shantay, Age 16, Legal Youth Advocate<br/></strong></p>
<p>Shantay joined 'A Place to Be' less than six months ago with a goal of working in the law. After spending more time with Shantay, we learned that she wanted to be a youth law advocate so that ""kids like her didn't have to go through what she did in her life."" For her project, Shantay working closely with her Personal Coach this summer to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Researched how The Americans With Disabilities Act and other laws help teens and young adults make a transition to secondary education and into the workforce.</li>
<li>Wrote a summary paper about her research.</li>
<li>Drew a picture of a youth advocating for himself. (See gallery)</li>
<li>Met with The Essex County District Attorney's Office to learn about job opportunities as a youth law advocate.</li>
<li>(Still to be completed): Attend a day of adult court session with an attorney from the Assistant District Attorney's Office to learn more about how the court system works, and the role of a youth law advocate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chris, Age 18, 'Mr. Breezy', Budding DJ</strong></p>
<p>Chris came to 'A Place to Be' reluctantly on the referral of his Case Manager. When Chris participated in a presentation by DJ Clyde of Encore DJ Services, he decided he wanted to become a DJ too. 'A Place to Be' told Chris that we were <em>investing in him</em> by hiring a professional DJ to help him. After several months of sessions with DJ Clyde, Chris earned his certificate at a DJ from the National Association of Mobile Entertainers. Chris had his DJ debut at the Salvation Army in Haverhill on March 3rd, 2012, and earned his first stipend as a paid DJ!</p>
<p><strong><strong>Elizabeth, Age 17, Shares Her Big Heart Through Community Service</strong></strong></p>
<p>Elizabeth, who has been with 'A Place to Be' since April, 2010, has a big heart, and a passion for helping older people. Knowing this, 'A Place to Be' staff created two opportunities for Liz to lead her peers in projects working with a local nursing home in Haverhill. In one project, Liz and Kids Cook, made appetizers and served them to the residents before dinner. During the second project, Liz and her Personal Coach organized an activity to make Easter cards for relatives and friends of the residents. One possible career path that these activities have opened for Liz is an internship now at the nursing home. We'll help Liz with this when the program continues...</p>

<div> </div></div>","'A Place to Be': Make Friends, Have Fun, Be Yourself!
When 'A Place to Be' was launched nearly three years ago, my daughter, now 25, made me aware of a growing epidemic in our communities. Month after month for three years, I was hearing about youth in our communities in Essex County, Massachusetts, that were overdosing on drugs and committing suicide at an alarming rate. I knew that something was terribly wrong. It was then that I decided to launch GenYLife Design (pronounced 'Jen Why Life Design'), and become an advocate for at-risk youth in Generation Y. http://www.genylifedesign.com/about_us
Initially, I invested $10,000 of my own money, and also raised another $28,000 from a generous family member, and one patron who believed in me, and our cause. This was in February of 2010. Within two months of launch, our first program was funded by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts--a pre-vocational program co-sponsored by The Boys and Girls Clubs. Since then, we've grown our budget to $135,000 a year solely through state funding. This has has made it possible for us to provide year-round, out-of-school time programs to disadvantaged youth with social, emotional and behavioral issues, in several under-served communities in Massachusetts, including Lawrence, Haverhill, Gloucester and Salisbury.
Why we need your help. The Commonwealth of MA has been good to us, and helped get us launched. We're grateful! However, just recently, we learned that our prime funding source at the state level is changing how they fund their Youth Support Programs. This means, we can no longer afford to operate the quality of programming we've built our reputation on-- given the new rate and payment structure. In addition, the eligibility requirements for our kids to be funded by this state program are eliminating many deserving kids from the state's approved program roster--including some kids who we've served for over two years. What may appear to be a challenge to others is an opportunity in disguise to us! 
Our Mission and Programs
The focus of our programs is two-fold: First, we help our kids make friends, learn to socialize (without the use of electronics!), and navigate issues such as bullying and cyber-bullying before these incidences cause damage. Second, through one-on-one Personal Coaching/Mentoring, we guide our kids to discover what they're passionate about and do naturally and well. We call this their 'WOW Factor'. We then activate this life force in their communities as paid internships and jobs, micro-businesses, social ventures, or community outreach opportunities. This is the hallmark of what we do! Our uncommon approach builds confidence, self-esteem, and know-how! (See case studies below for examples.)http://www.genylifedesign.com/our_mission
Our programs have been hosted in well-respected youth and community organizations such as Salvation Army in Haverhill, the YMCA and Lawrence Community Connections in Lawrence, and Cape Ann Art Haven in Gloucester. As a Massachusetts small business, we've also created jobs for 15 staff employees, and contributed over $100,000 in payroll to talented folks who were previously unemployed, or underemployed.

On the Road


So far, the tour has crossed the country and made appearances at many

Rebuilding Gaden Shartse Dokhang Monastery


Recently, building started on the first portion of dorms thanks to a 
loan they are diligently working to repay. This December, H.H. the 14th

Video Transcript


Eight monks from the Gaden Shartse Dokhang Monastery are coming to the U.S. with the blessing of His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama to share their culture and paths to inner peace and compassion. The purpose of the tour is to raise funds for their monastery to build dormitories, a prayer hall and to support the educational and medical needs of the monks.
Gaden Monastery is one of the three most renowned monasteries of Tibet.
Originally founded in Tibet in 1409 by Tsongkhapa, Gaden is where the Gelugpa
School of Tibetan Buddhism emerged.
After the invasion and subsequent occupation of Tibet by the People's
Liberation Army of China, in the 1950s, the monastery was rebuilt from scratch
by a few exiled monks in Southern India. Today it is home to over 1200 monks, scholars and students and it has produced many significant teachers in the tradition, including Geshe Thupten Jinpa, PhD, the primary English interpreter for His Holiness the 14th
Dalai Lama.
""This is a community that is so important historically as part of Ganden Monastery and lately the community has gone through a very difficult time. And the community needs to be rebuilt and the continued presence of this community in Ganden is very important.
The Foundation of the Sacred Stream is a non-profit organization in
Berkeley, CA, and is host of the tour and will be providing ongoing support and
assistance to the monks throughout their time in the U.S.
By contributing to this campaign, you will literally put the monks on the road. Contributions will help pay for a van and travel expenses for the eight monks and their assistant. Your contributions will also help with the building of much needed facilities at the monastery in Southern India. And most importantly, you will be directly helping the monks preserve and share their beautiful traditions. We have some very special gifts for you as part of this campaign and if you would like the monks to come to your town for a dharma talk, cultural performance, chanting concert or to build a sand mandala all you have to do is let us know.

<div>
<p><strong>Norbert Boruett, Distant Learning Manager, FUNZOKenya a Project within IntraHealth International, Kenya</strong></p>
<p>“Nellie Deutsch is an amazing person. She is enormous intellect and humanity in equal profession. Nellie is the guru in e learning.Let me support my assertion. I first met Nellie in Wikieducator and the class was big and she tutored us on the robes of wiki and we were able to post content. Her facilitation was learner centered, we did assignment and presented. Constructive feedback was offered. The live sessions were very lively and it was nice to present your material to an audience. Later Nellie introduced me to Moodle. This was very useful to me, since by then my institution was thinking of using Moodle. This training where graduates and I progressed from the beginners, intermediate, advance. The fee was very minimal. The competence that I gained was very useful- I became a consultant in Moodle in my country and not to forget the networks I made in IT4ALL, we are constantly in communication exploring e learning and leveraging on our experiences. Without IT4all the network I have could not have been possible. Later I did an administrative course in Moodle and eventually developed the capacity to host my own site- innovative moodling.org. I think Nellie has changed the World and proved that e learning works. I have never met Nellie face to face, but I know her so well, she has transferred a lot of skills to me, put succinctly, she has transformed me to be an educational technologist from a great distance.</p>
<p>We need to support Nellie and Dariem as they promote open source software chief among them Moodle.” August 21, 2012</p>
<p><strong>J. R. Radney (PhD), Facilitator, Integrating Technology</strong></p>
<p>“When I first started using MOODLE to support my face-to-face courses at Thompson Rivers University, Nellie's course ""Moodle for Teachers"" was recommended to me. I started in the course and moved to facilitating, so others could get the same sort of help I received. Nellie is a dedicated leader and teacher, who cares deeply about all her students. She is very capable, and she has designed several programs of study to benefit a wide range of people. I love working with her and her team of facilitators.” August 18, 2012</p>

<p><strong>Judith Behrens</strong>, Mentor/Teacher, IT4ALL</p>
<p>“Dr. Nellie Deutsch has been an welcomed aspiration for me for the past 19 months. I stumbled on to her IT4ALL site in January, 2011. I am a graduate of her Moodle classes(Decemeber, 2012) and in January 2012 I was given the honor of being assigned a new role of Mentor and Teacher for the Moodle classes she offers at IT4ALL. Nellie has given of her time, research, and talent for many years. She has supported many online learners for FREE, including myself. I have nothing but high regards for this wonderful lady. It is because of her that I have the skills in Moodle that I have now. Nellie gave me the courage to join her team and present at her online CO12 conference. She has been getting ready to sponsor a MOOC, more FREE online learning sessions given by the people she has trained over the last 5-7 years. We need more people like her. She has been blessed with a great gift and she shares it FREELY with whoever asks her to. Please support Nellie Deutsch and the IT4ALL courses so that they remain for FREE for as long as Nellie is around or even longer! Long live IT4ALL. ;) Respectfully submitted, Judith Behrens” August 13, 2012</p>

<p> “Dr. Nellie Deutsch is someone that I have been following for the past 4+ years as a leader and innovator in offering online training for faculty and students. My position as Technology Director for several grant programs at East Los Angeles College requires me to assist faculty in applying technology in their classes, and to manage a Moodle site where our faculty can web-enhance their face-to-face classes. As I researched 'best practices' I found that I was continuously running into Nellie, IT4ALL and WizIQ. I highly applaud and complement her for what she has done for our faculty and students; and the best recommendation I can give is that of our instructors that note a rise in student success following her examples and tenets.” August 12, 2012</p>

As a Moodle learner, I have taken four Moodle courses that Dr Nellie has brilliantly facilitated, from Moodle orientation to Moodle Advanced.I have found her extremely hard working,inspirational and I have always wondered how on earth she can manage all the courses on IR4ALL websites.There is always something new. As far as Open Educational Resources(OER) are concerned, I think Dr Nellie is model that other people in the developped world should emulate so as to make OERs as accessible as possible to the rest of the developing world.

Her passion to get people included in global technology enhanced learning is remarkable. It is amazing how she keeps on going, motivates people and finds the energy to boost a variety of online communities.

<p>“Nellie is a perfect example of a powerhouse of the most important kind in this 21st Century. She wholeheartedly believes in using her fertile mind and incredible witty intellect to create order out of chaos daily. Nellie goes to great lengths to show everyone she meets online and in person that hard work and a modicum of luck always pays off. Nellie is passionate about teaching, reaching out to include new ideas and will inevitably accomplish each of her goals well ahead of schedule. Nellie has acted flawlessly as a magnet to include not deny others, by interacting extremely well as a moderator online and as a natural born leader in person. She acts in concert as a team player dovetailing precisely with both her mentors and her peers, Nellie is one of those very rare teachers and devoted mothers who naturally inspires and leads others both young and old alike as they begin grasping the nuances of life. She consistently aims to build consensus in that Nellie’s extraordinary abilities show up in everything she touches.

Testimonials by Educators Around the Globe

Norbert Boruett, Distant Learning Manager, FUNZOKenya a Project within IntraHealth International, Kenya
“Nellie Deutsch is an amazing person. She is enormous intellect and humanity in equal profession. Nellie is the guru in e learning.Let me support my assertion. I first met Nellie in Wikieducator and the class was big and she tutored us on the robes of wiki and we were able to post content. Her facilitation was learner centered, we did assignment and presented. Constructive feedback was offered. The live sessions were very lively and it was nice to present your material to an audience. Later Nellie introduced me to Moodle. This was very useful to me, since by then my institution was thinking of using Moodle. This training where graduates and I progressed from the beginners, intermediate, advance. The fee was very minimal. The competence that I gained was very useful- I became a consultant in Moodle in my country and not to forget the networks I made in IT4ALL, we are constantly in communication exploring e learning and leveraging on our experiences. Without IT4all the network I have could not have been possible. Later I did an administrative course in Moodle and eventually developed the capacity to host my own site- innovative moodling.org. I think Nellie has changed the World and proved that e learning works. I have never met Nellie face to face, but I know her so well, she has transferred a lot of skills to me, put succinctly, she has transformed me to be an educational technologist from a great distance.
We need to support Nellie and Dariem as they promote open source software chief among them Moodle.” August 21, 2012

Hi, my name is Kevin Dunn and I am known to most folks as Mr. Puzzles, the creator of the award-winning Puzzles For Us cultural ""edutainment"" series. Mr. Puzzles and I are appealing to you at this time for help in raising $12,000 to print 5,000 copies of our exciting puzzle books and to participate in the National Alliance of Black School Educators (NABSE) Conference in November.With only 30 days left to the NABSE Conference, time is running short, which is why we need your help now. 
Several years ago we came up with the idea for a crossword and word search puzzle book series that would use exciting stories, profiles and interesting facts to highlight the ongoing contributions of people and communities of color to the global community.
This groundbreaking idea eventually evolved into the extremely popular Puzzles For Us series which currently consists of four puzzle books and an upcoming coloring book.
         
The titles of the four books and the new coloring book in the series are:
The Crossword Connection - crossword puzzle book for ages 12 to adult

Puzzles For Us Jr. - word search story & activity book for ages 5 & older
In Search of Yourself - word search puzzle book for ages 12 to adult

Piecing It Together - word search story book for ages 10 & older
All About Me - coloring book profiling famous African Americans for ages 3 & older

 
      
Enjoyed by children and adults of all ages, each of the books feature fascinating stories, narratives, and little known facts about some of the amazing things that people of color have done and are doing around the world.
Whether it's an early 19th century drawing depicting the original Statue of Liberty as a woman of mixed ancestry, or a puzzle spotlighting teenagers who are creating their own businesses, the Puzzles For Us ""edutainment"" series is designed to make learning an exciting fun experience for children and adults of all ages.
   
""Everyone should treat their children and themselves to your puzzle  books. They don't just entertain, they educate, motivate, inspire. They remind us of the rich legacy we need to reclaim and resurrect.""  - Perri Gaffney, ActorOur exciting line of puzzle books has also received wonderful reviews from a host of educators, parents, administrators, program directors, and people like you around the country who recognize the puzzles as a great resource for increasing literacy, building self-esteem, and for connecting people to information and resources that helps to improve the quality of their lives.One high school principal in New York had this to say:""We are particularly interested in this series since it is both educational and fun. It also allows our students the opportunity to be involved in academics with a direct emphasis on their culture and heritage. The books will be a great resource for our staff and in building literacy and implementing multicultural activities.""  While another educator in Colorado said the following:""I donated the books to a charter school here in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  They were thrilled. I think your books are wonderful.""   Well, that's a little about us, now here's what we want to do and why we need your help.What We Want To Do and Why We Need Your HelpOkay, so here's our ultimate goal. We need to print 5,000 puzzle books that will be used to raise funds for various programs in urban areas in the U.S. that are providing educational and other types of support services for children and adults.
One of these programs is the International Youth Leadership Institute (http://www.iyli.org) where high school students get a chance to travel to countries like Brazil, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Israel, Mexico, Morocco, Senegal, South Africa, and Spain . . . 
               
while another is The Learning Tree Cultural Preparatory School (http://www.learningtreeprep.org) where along with a rigorous academic regimen students are prepared to be global ambassadors by going on school-sponsored trips to countries such as China, France, Mexico, Ghana, South Africa, Spain/Morocco, Egypt and Kenya.
                      These are just two of the programs we want to help, and there are literally hundreds of others. That's where the Meet Mr. Puzzles National Book Tour comes in.As part of the tour, we will travel to several cities over the next several months, beginning with Detroit in November, conducting speaking engagements, hosting puzzle parties, and participating in a number of educational conferences. A portion of the monies raised on the tour from the sale of our books will be donated to a number of educational programs around the country.Our first stop on the tour is the National Alliance of Black School Educators Conference (NABSE) which takes place in November 2013 at the Cobo Arena in Detroit, Michigan. Schools, organizations and agencies like the two highlighted above will be coming from all over the country to attend this Conference, which is why we are so fired up about being there because it gives us a perfect opportunity to meet with some of the programs we are looking to help, and a chance to tell them about our fundraising tour and how they can apply for donations.                  And that's just the start. From this kickoff point, we will move on to bring the Meet Mr. Puzzles National Book Tour to other cities like Philadelphia, Newark, Baltimore, Washington, DC, Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, and New York.But first things first. In order to make this all happen we need your help. First, we need to print 5,000 books. Secondly, we need to pay for exhibitor space at the NABSE Conference. Lastly, we need to make sure that our traveling expenses to get to the Conference are covered.
Here's a breakdown of what we need and what it will cost:
To print 4,000 puzzle books (four titles @ 1,000 books each). Cost: $6,800
To print 1,000 copies of new coloring book. Cost: $1,900

Pay for exhibitor booth at NABSE Conference. Cost: $1,525

Shipping fees to transport books to Conference: Cost $385

Travel expenses to NABSE Conference for two team members. Cost: $948

How We Are Making A Difference 

Since our puzzle books tell the stories of people, places and events that generally don't get told or talked about, they are a big hit with our readership whose ages range from 5 to 85. Whether it's a puzzle about bullying, African American inventors, or celebrities like tennis greats Venus and Serena Williams, people like the idea that they can learn and be entertained at the same time. 
So basically, we are helping to keep people informed, helping them to feel better about themselves, and ultimately getting more youngsters to read, especially boys. And just as important, we are providing an educational resource that teachers, parents and others can use to creatively engage youngsters both inside and outside of the classroom.
  Finally, through the Meet Mr. Puzzles National Book Tour fundraising efforts we will be providing donations to organizations in support of the work they are doing to improve the quality of life for the people and communities they serve. Learn more.Where Your $$$ Go And What You Get

A BIG THANK YOU (MURAKOZE CYANE ) TO EVERYBODY WHO CONTRIBUTED, SHARED AND JUST TOOK INTEREST!!Hi I'm Maria from
Rwanda and I have a dream! I applied for a fellowship at the DO
school in New York City. (thedoschool.org/)  And get
this, I won!  
 
All the way from Rwanda, I have been selected - along with only 19 other people
around the world - for a one year program which starts with a 10 week course
in New York City at the School, followed by a ten-month phase back home. I
received financial assistance for my flight, housing
and dinners. I just need to raise $1,700 for breakfast, lunches
and public transportation. I received my US visa and my bags are packed.
Enable me to realize this once in a lifetime opportunity so that I can multiply
its effects when I go back home to Rwanda. You are not just helping me, but
contributing to a better future for my country too!!I’ll be participating
in the Sustainable Cup Challenge 2014 which is organized by the DO School

<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p>Are you concerned about how problems affect children in the world particularly in Africa? Do you want the world change to a better one? How and when do you think this change must take place?</p>
<p>I am asking you these questions because I know that you want to see a change happens in the world. I do know that you are always concerned how problems affect children daily anywhere in the world. If you are there for change or wanting to create opportunities for unfortunate children of Africa, then just join me and act now. You and I need to change this world start now. Let us change this world by giving disadvantaged children the opportunities they need. Let us begin with creating a community that free of war, conflicts, poverty and disasters.  This is exactly why I’m running this fundraising campaign. I used to be one of those children who had very unfortunate life, but through people help, I received hope again. Here I am!</p>
<p> You can imagine that there are millions of children suffer and unfortunately die when they do not meet the needs they DESERVE! Let us not let that happen. I'm very confident that if we work together we can stop such unfortunates to children and we will definitely create a better world. I know there are many places in the world that need urgent help and change. But let us begin changing the world with the world's newest African country, Republic of South Sudan. The country tries to recover from two decades civil wars and in addition to preexisting poverty. Children in this country need very urgent opportunities to survive and meet hope again. One of their very pressing needs is education. They need EDUCATION!</p>
<p>Please consider a donation today.  Every small or large contribution makes a difference in war, genocides, and poverty affected children of Africa.

<p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
<p>When remote Makuac village completely destroyed during the two decades civil war in South Sudan has its own school, war orphans and vulnerable children will no longer have to trek eight hours round trip on foot to get an education. One school locates in Mangar Mou village is about 8 hours around trip from Makuac village and has been operated under tree since 2007. This school has many negative problems  and impacts on children such as lack of school buildings, unqualified teachers-who cannot even express themselves in English, lack of school supplies, short term learning ability. It just like of no school at all. Beig operated under trees; it is totally unsafe to children: branches falling, bad weather, animals attack and hungry. Makuach village children urgently need a REALLY SCHOOL!</p>
<p><strong>What is the issue, problem, or challenge?</strong></p>
<p>The only school in Mangar Mou village has to serve several thousand elementary-aged students is an under tree school. Some schools in other villages are small two-room temporary shack made out of twigs. The shack, used for early elementary, has no text books and no pit latrines (giving the school grounds an unpleasant odor). Once children pass their exams to start primary 4, they must trek eight hours round trip on foot through the wild bush to the nearest primary school, which is 70 kilometers away. Almost no families allow their daughters to make this trek.</p>
<p><strong>How will this project solve this problem?</strong></p>
<p>Our Makuach Central School will be committed to providing free primary and secondary education to children in ten villages around Makuch village area. A 32 classroom vision will be built in 4 phases; each phase will have 8 classrooms, 8 teachers’ homes, 2 toilet blocks, a library, an office, and a store.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Long Term Impact</strong></p>
<p>The project gives a new country’s children a ticket out of poverty.  Through Makuach School, educated girls can eventually give their own families a good start in life. Educated boys can escape a family cycle of hard labor. This will ripple to their families and community. Follow Dominic Diing’s vision as the global citizen, children who will attend Makuach Central School will be educated to become stars and contributed citizens of their own countries and the world.</p>
<p><strong>Project Message</strong></p>
<p>Providing housing for teachers is a necessity. Makuach has virtually no educated people, so we have to bring in teachers from outside the area. Few people would come without adequate housing. More importantly, building Makuach Central School for children without education is not Dominic Diing and his friends’ responsibility alone, it is yours as well. So please join us and help us reach out to those who can help us reach our fund raising goal so that we will be able to begin building the school by December 2013.</p>

One school locates in Mangar Mou village is about 8 hours around trip from Makuac village and has been operated under tree since 2007. This school has many negative problems  and impacts on children such as lack of school buildings, unqualified teachers-who cannot even express themselves in English, lack of school supplies, short term learning ability. It just like of no school at all. Beig operated under trees; it is totally unsafe to children: branches falling, bad weather, animals attack and hungry. Makuach village children urgently need a REALLY SCHOOL!
What is the issue, problem, or challenge?
The only school in Mangar Mou village has to serve several thousand elementary-aged students is an under tree school. Some schools in other villages are small two-room temporary shack made out of twigs. The shack, used for early elementary, has no text books and no pit latrines (giving the school grounds an unpleasant odor). Once children pass their exams to start primary 4, they must trek eight hours round trip on foot through the wild bush to the nearest primary school, which is 70 kilometers away. Almost no families allow their daughters to make this trek.
How will this project solve this problem?
Our Makuach Central School will be committed to providing free primary and secondary education to children in ten villages around Makuch village area. A 32 classroom vision will be built in 4 phases; each phase will have 8 classrooms, 8 teachers’ homes, 2 toilet blocks, a library, an office, and a store.
Potential Long Term Impact
The project gives a new country’s children a ticket out of poverty.  Through Makuach School, educated girls can eventually give their own families a good start in life. Educated boys can escape a family cycle of hard labor. This will ripple to their families and community. Follow Dominic Diing’s vision as the global citizen, children who will attend Makuach Central School will be educated to become stars and contributed citizens of their own countries and the world.
Project Message
Providing housing for teachers is a necessity. Makuach has virtually no educated people, so we have to bring in teachers from outside the area. Few people would come without adequate housing. More importantly, building Makuach Central School for children without education is not Dominic Diing and his friends’ responsibility alone, it is yours as well. So please join us and help us reach out to those who can help us reach our fund raising goal so that we will be able to begin building the school by December 2013.

<h3>Hi, my name is Natalie and I am a mom, surfer and special education teacher in Northern California.</h3>
In recent years, there have been news stories on shows like Nightline about the profound positive effect surfing has on individuals on the autism spectrum.  Although no formal studies have been conducted on the surfing-autism connection, theories range from the “increased blood flow to crucial neurons and the reshaping of abnormal structures in the front brain” to surfing being a “vehicle to an emotional breakthrough, a way of reaching under the mask and perhaps connecting” to these children. (<a href=""http://thesecondsight.blogspot.com/2006/12/autism-surfing.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://thesecondsight.blogspot.com/2006/12/auti...</a>).  One mother told me that she recently took her 6 ½ year old surfing and that his transformation in the water was amazing!  He was comfortable in his own skin, displayed no self-stimulating behavior such as flapping, no aggression, and was smiling and laughing the entire time he spent in the water.  Surfing is an activity out of the realm of services these children typically participate in and is viewed as “normal” activity.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I began researching the idea of a surf camp for children with autism and discovered that there are no week-long camps, from Santa Cruz to the Oregon border, that serve this population.  It made sense that I combine my passion for surfing with my passion for educating and working with children with special needs, specifically autism.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>A brief description of the program:</h3>
<p>Spectrum Surf Camps offer one-week surf camps specifically designed to serve children, ages 5 – 17, on the autism spectrum.  The camp is limited to six (6) students with a 1:1 instructor/student ratio.  Our staff includes highly qualified surf instructors who are expert surfers, have worked with children and adults with disabilities, and are certified in CPR and/or certified in ocean rescue.  In addition to the surf instructors, the staff includes an occupational therapist, behavior specialist, special education teacher, and peer volunteers.</p>
<p>While there is no guarantee that each student will stand up on his/her board, s/he will certainly experience the thrill of riding a wave. </p>
<div> </div>
<h3>A little bit about me...</h3>
<div> </div>
<div>As I was studying for the California Bar Exam, I took a position as a 1:1 instructional assistant for a student in the 2nd grade.  I found the experience working with children with special needs to be an extremely rewarding one and moved from a 1:1 instructional assistant to a Resource Specialist aide and then went back to school for my California teaching credential as an Education Specialist.  I have been working as a special education teacher since 2003.</div>
<div>
<br/>In fall of 2000, I paddled out to the surf.  I caught the very first wave I paddled for and was hooked.  I have been surfing ever since. </div>

I come from a very conservative Christian family and knew from a very early age that being gay was never an acceptable lifestyle. I originally came out to my friends and coworkers when I was 19, but my family eventually found out. Once they found off I went to Bible school in Australia as a means of conversion therapy and to repress my homosexual tendencies. During that time I went through multiple 'deliverance' rituals where the demons of homosexuality were supposedly cast out of me. I was gone a total of 8 months. Shortly after I got home from my 'conversion' I told my parents that I still had homosexual tendencies and went to Exodus International ministries in June 2011. I left Exodus more confused. It was only a couple months later that my life would change. I met my now boyfriend in my first year of University and we hit it off immediately. We had been dating for just over a year when my family found out about our relationship. They found out this past January. They forced me to break up with my boyfriend and tried to force me to go to conversion therapy again and wanted me to become heavily involved with church. My heart was completely broken and I have never cried as much as I did that month. After a week of being apart and heart broken, my best friend arranged for my boyfriend and I to talk. We got back together that night. My parents found out a week later and threw me out February 6, 2013. Until that point I did not have to pay rent as I was living at home, and my parents paid my education. Since then I have found a place to live and have had to pay for my education and textbooks, pay rent, and all other costs that come with living on my own. I am struggling to make my payments and have had to start working 2 jobs, while being a full-time student. I am struggling to find time to study and do homework from working 2 jobs and being in school full-time. Last week I was only home to sleep and I am burnt out.</p>

<p>Over the last ten years, the team behind the Center for Narrative Practice has been involved in a growing,<b> innovative program</b> at an Ivy League academic medical center that uses narrative in the training of healthcare professionals, bringing <b>humanity back to healthcare</b> practice through close work with stories of all kinds. Our expertise for applying narrative and creativity in the healthcare setting has achieved a <b>global reputation</b>. We have seen, again and again and again, the power of applied work with the arts, and we have come to believe that the next step is to branch out from healthcare.</p>
<p>We want to <b>reach more people</b>; we want to <b>build a movement</b>, and to <b>spread the power</b> of this work to the <b>farthest corners of the world</b>; we want to bring people together from all professions, fields, backgrounds, and interests, and to offer a program for<b> learning that is accessible</b> for as many as possible. The greater the diversity of the cohort, we have learned, the more powerful the result, and the farther the reach.</p>
<p>We are building the Center without <b>start-up support</b> from academia, grants, or foundations--we want to construct it on a solid foundation <b>free of the politics</b>, compromise, and obstacles that will inevitably challenge us as we <b>grow</b>.<br/></p>
<p>To this end, the <b>vision</b> of the Center for Narrative Practice was<b> born</b>, and to this end we ask you to <b>join</b> us.  <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">   </span></p>

We will provide training through the discussion of writing in the language of text and constructive criticism. </p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Narrative Intervention</b></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">In a situation where people are struggling due to perceived ownership of certain deeply held beliefs or concepts related to work environments, the use of narrative – stories that no one “owns” – can allow new elements to be seen and persons to re-connect and loosen their grip on whatever issues are troubling them.</p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><b>Critical Theory </b></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Narrative is our primary device for making sense of social action. The “Narrative Turn” in critical thinking takes as its starting point the fact that individuals, institutions, nations and cultures construct their identities by locating themselves within plotted stories. What’s more, drawing forth and attending to stories that have no place among the repertoire of “legitimate” narratives --those of the vulnerable or silenced-- require narrative skill.  <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/595541/files/20140521144501-perk_corner_notebook.jpg?1400708701"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/683411/files/20140629221111-BS_Cartoon_4.jpg?1404105071"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/556746/files/20140504161553-gogo_bar.jpg?1399245353"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h1 style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></h1><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/646405/files/20140613044632-new_headerplanning.jpg?1402659992"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Once we have raised the start-up funds, we begin the work of designing, recruiting and building a world-class center.

Over the last ten years, the team behind the Center for Narrative Practice has been involved in a growing, innovative program at an Ivy League academic medical center that uses narrative in the training of healthcare professionals, bringing humanity back to healthcare practice through close work with stories of all kinds. Our expertise for applying narrative and creativity in the healthcare setting has achieved a global reputation. We have seen, again and again and again, the power of applied work with the arts, and we have come to believe that the next step is to branch out from healthcare.
We want to reach more people; we want to build a movement, and to spread the power of this work to the farthest corners of the world; we want to bring people together from all professions, fields, backgrounds, and interests, and to offer a program for learning that is accessible for as many as possible. The greater the diversity of the cohort, we have learned, the more powerful the result, and the farther the reach.
We are building the Center without start-up support from academia, grants, or foundations--we want to construct it on a solid foundation free of the politics, compromise, and obstacles that will inevitably challenge us as we grow.
To this end, the vision of the Center for Narrative Practice was born, and to this end we ask you to join us.

He understood the power of narrative when he looked at his own story, and the disparate fields and sharp turns his career has taken, and saw the narrative thread that runs through all of his work: a fierce dedication to ideas, design, and results, and a lifelong desire to change the world.https://www.linkedin.com/pub/scott-alderman/46/9a8/970MAURAgrew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where the streets themselves were storied.  A bookish child, she read Kafka, Baudelaire and Garcia-Marquez on the IRT, and she grew up to teach literature and film.  She has been exploring narrative with students at Columbia University and Barnard College for more than twenty years. She rediscovers the power of narrative every day in the classroom. http://www.linkedin.com/pub/maura-spiegel/8/78/2a7CRAIGfirst fell in love with the art of storytelling on his family’s farm in Minnesota. The farmers of the plains have traditionally been storytellers: Craig's grandparents and parents honored this tradition. Their storytelling was the revelation of this meaning, illuminating the world embraced by their horizon. As an academic director, philosopher, educator, and writer, Craig shares his lifelong love of storytelling with his students, and hopes that he is honoring the tradition of those whose art first inspired him.  http://www.linkedin.com/pub/craig-irvine/b/503/75aNELLIEis a Boston-bred novelist.

Her first novel was a fictionalized account of her own family’s story, and the process of writing it was life-changing, cementing the understanding of how crafting a story can change the way that it lives in your body and mind. https://twitter.com/NellieGHermannWe are four of the people behind the CNP, and we believe in this work because of what it has already given to us, and what we have seen it give to countless others. Everyone has stories, and we want to hear yours.The Center is launching in its first location in Cambridge, MA, and will begin accepting certificate students in fall 2015. Our goal is to raise $65,000. Achieving our goal let's us: 
Have greater outreach to recruit our first class through print advertising and roadshow recruitment activities.

Strengthens our position as we establish academic partnerships and alliances with other organizations.

Gives us flexibility and options as we go about the business of building a world class learning center.
PLEASE NOTE: WE ARE A 501c3 NON-PROFIT CORPORATION, AND YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS TAX DEDUCTIBLE.At the Center for Narrative Practice we believe that stories are the primordial means through which we make sense of and convey the meaning of our lives. We believe stories can be a tool for healing, for teaching, for sharing and connecting. We believe that creativity can be learned, and practiced, and can change the way persons live in the world. We believe that critical, skilled attention to stories and storytelling in all of its forms is and ought to be recognized as a part of all disciplines, and that narrative practice can and does lead toward openness and healing. The Center for Narrative Practice will provide deep critical training in how stories work, both personally and culturally, and in the ability to apply this knowledge to everyday life by using narrative practice, the creative arts, and the study of story as a bridge towards deeper connections in interdisciplinary and inter-professional education. The training and education the Center offers will be for professionals, scholars, undergraduates, graduate students, and all those interested in the applications of narrative and creativity in their respective fields. Through traditional programs, low-residency and online programs, and partnerships with other academic institutions and organizations, the Center will broaden the applications for narrative and creative skills locally and internationally.A registered 501c3 non-profit corporation, the Center will be self-funded and self-sustaining by its range of offerings and activities. Grants, private donors, and fundraising activities will be pursued to augment development, research, and reach.Certificate of Study in Narrative Practice--Low Residency

The Center believes that the need for narrative and creative training, and the benefit of narrative competency, cross all fields. To that end, in addition to interdisciplinary core training, the Center is designed to provide specialized concentration tracks in areas that we believe are of crucial importance to successful communication and community. Rather than teaching our students a specific discipline, our methods provide a tool kit that will expand, augment, improve, and, ultimately, transform the academic and professional experience.For almost two decades, the team behind the Center has been at the forefront of developing methods to understand, research, and teach narrative and creativity.  At the core of these methods is the practice of creativity and use of the imagination; the study and creation of literary work, film, theater, graphic novels, and other arts are fundamental threads in all of the tools we have developed, and the application of creativity is common throughout our methods.Close ReadingAlso referred to as “slow reading,” the act of reading something carefully—whether a poem, novel, short story, memoir or a painting, sonata, play—and attending to all aspects of its dimensionality—form, voice, temporality, diction, movement, space, etc.—teaches us to pay closer attention to all aspects of our world, and reveals the ways that attentive looking and listening can engage the complexity of human expression.Reflective and Creative WritingThis is writing with an eye toward discovery of new meanings and new forms, writing as a tool for expansion of the mind and spirit, and discovery of uncovered aspects of self and connections to colleagues. We will provide training through the discussion of writing in the language of text and constructive criticism. Narrative InterventionIn a situation where people are struggling due to perceived ownership of certain deeply held beliefs or concepts related to work environments, the use of narrative – stories that no one “owns” – can allow new elements to be seen and persons to re-connect and loosen their grip on whatever issues are troubling them.Critical Theory Narrative is our primary device for making sense of social action. The “Narrative Turn” in critical thinking takes as its starting point the fact that individuals, institutions, nations and cultures construct their identities by locating themselves within plotted stories. What’s more, drawing forth and attending to stories that have no place among the repertoire of “legitimate” narratives --those of the vulnerable or silenced-- require narrative skill.  Once we have raised the start-up funds, we begin the work of designing, recruiting and building a world-class center. Key action items include:Classroom SpaceWe will rent temporary meeting space for our first two years, with a goal of securing permanent classroom and office space by fall 2017. Advisory BoardWe will invite and convene an advisory board to meet by spring 2015. The advisory board will be comprised of leaders in the field of narrative theory and practice.FellowshipsWe will offer fellowships beginning in the 2016-2017 school year. The fellowships will be designed to support our graduates in their work.ProjectionsThe following details our three-year tuition and expense projections:A diverse group of scholars, artists, teachers and thinkers have come together to create the Center for Narrative Practice. All feel the power and potential of narrative and creativity for affecting change in the world, and believe in the need for an independent center in the service of narrative practice and theory. Spanning disciplines, genres, and interests, the leadership and faculty of the Center bring the unparalleled experience necessary to build a sustainable, world-class entity. LEADERSHIP Scott Alderman (Founding Director)Scott Alderman's career as an entrepreneur and organizer has taken him to the music business (as European road manager for Lionel Hampton, and a producer of festivals that have played at Giants Stadium and Red Rocks), to Wall Street ( Morgan Stanley), and to social services (working as a counselor at a residence for homeless people with AIDS).

is an eight-time ""polar bear"" and has never thought to ask people to pay her to do something she so enjoys.  She has often wondered what it is that compels her into Lake Michigan each year. In the past it has been the frisson of participating in local ritual, but this year she is ""doing it for her students!"" She is a
native of Kansas and Arizona, but has called Milwaukee home since 1998.  Along with her polar bear plunge posse (pictured above), Jodi
established the Weeathlon.  A great Milwaukee tradition, the Weeathlon purports to be the world's shortest triathlon. The event occurs every
January 1st with a ride around the block, a run to the lake and a very, very
short swim in Lake Michigan.  </blockquote><h2><b style=""letter-spacing: 1.440000057220459px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: x-large;"">Polar Plunge Plan</b></h2><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To participate:</span></p><ol>

The 2014 Coastal Cities Polar BearsDavid BrookerDavid is a Florida boy raised on the Gulf of Mexico.He has never seen the need to do the Polar Bear Plunge, even in the summer Lake Michigan is too cold for his Gulf-influenced taste.However, he is willing to give it a try if donors say he should.When you make a donation feel free to say “Plunge” or “Don’t Plunge”.If the “Plunge” donations are greater than the “Don’t Plunge” donations he will do it.Kyle CherekKyle Cherek was born in Waukesha, WI and raised by sensible, decent and generally pragmatic people.  The concept of willingly doing what was their most acerbic retort ('Go jump in a lake!') on one of the coldest days of the year is about as odd to them as trying to catch a baseball with an oven mitt.  He has never asked anyone to give money to a cause on behalf of his irrational behavior, but based on our current system of funding political office, it seems right in line. On warmer days he enjoys public television, sandals without socks, and longs walks on the beach. This will be his 5th Polar Bear Plunge.Jodi Eastberg
Jodi
is an eight-time ""polar bear"" and has never thought to ask people to pay her to do something she so enjoys.  She has often wondered what it is that compels her into Lake Michigan each year. In the past it has been the frisson of participating in local ritual, but this year she is ""doing it for her students!"" She is a
native of Kansas and Arizona, but has called Milwaukee home since 1998.  Along with her polar bear plunge posse (pictured above), Jodi
established the Weeathlon.  A great Milwaukee tradition, the Weeathlon purports to be the world's shortest triathlon. The event occurs every
January 1st with a ride around the block, a run to the lake and a very, very
short swim in Lake Michigan.  Polar Plunge PlanTo participate:

 a donation of fixed amount (see the perks on the right)  we offer to the donor an exceptional privilege to 
choose a priority of development.  So, we will spend next month working on the priority you defined.  Of course, we can't promise <i>any</i> thing, so please select from the list below:<p></p><ul>
<li>Bones development (continued, see <a href=""http://wiki.synfig.org/wiki/Dev:Roadmap/Bones"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pending tasks</a>)<br/>
</li>
<li>Frame-by-frame bitmap animation support (continued, see <a href=""http://wiki.synfig.org/wiki/Dev:Roadmap/Frame-by-frame_animation_%28bitmap%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">current status</a>)</li>
<li>Rendering speed optimization</li>
<li>Sound support</li>
</ul><p>NOTE: We don't guarantee the feature from a selected priority to be <i>completely</i> <i>finished</i>
 within a month. Such promises are not compatible with development 
realities. What we promise is to dedicate no less than 85% of our 
working time to developing this priority for a full month. Though, one 
month is a  significant period and such dedication would lead to 
significant changes in selected direction. Many our users are aware that
 we used to publish <a href=""http://www.synfig.org/cms/en/download/development"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">development snapshots</a> regularly, so you will be able to benefit from development results as soon as possible.</p><p>EXAMPLE: As result of our earlier fundraising campaign, we got sold the ""Choose priority"" perk for October. The priority chosen by donor was ""Single-window UI"". You can see results in <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLzkBuNSCVI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this video</a>.</p><h3>""Development OS"" perk</h3><p>By default we use Linux operation system (OS) for daily development (because we love Linux). As result, the Linux version of Synfig is the most polished, because it goes through daily proof.</p><p>But, for a fixed-amount donation (see the perks on the right) you can make us shift to other OS for next month. So, if we will use the OS of your choice in our daily development, then obviously  the Synfig version will be especially polished to work on it: daily proof =&gt; more testing =&gt; less bugs =&gt; better stability.</p><p>No worries, this perk doesn't mean we drop support for other operation systems. It's just a question of choosing the OS for daily development.<br/><br/>At the moment the only OS available for choice is <b>Windows</b>.</p>

<p>We understand that there are people who would like to support our efforts by other means.

It's one of the most stable and democratic countries on the African continent, with from what I can see an incredibly vibrant culture that I can't wait to experience.This time, returning to Spain after my exchange year in Navarra two years ago, I'm going South instead of North, to the beautiful city of Seville. I'll be doing anintensive Spanish for Business course, as I am trying to brush up on my Spanish skills and ensure that they are relevant to a professional context. There are so many places I want to visit in and around Seville, so I am beyond excited to spend some time there!I have left Spain until last so that if by some miracle I have some extra cash at the end of my trip, I can use it to hang out here!What I Need & What You GetThe total cost for my gap year will be more than $15,000, and so my goal is to supplement the money I earn in my two jobs as much as possible!
Any funding I receive will go towards covering the costs of the programs in Sri Lanka, Ghana and Spain, as well as flights

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><span>Four years ago, anti-sex traffic worker and Buddhist monk Waha Long decided he was tired of seeing the subsistence rice farmers of  Sambat Village miss out on Cambodia's economic growth simply because they could not speak English.

<p><span>Now, Waha is dreaming bigger. He wants to build a 5-computer room to expedite English-language acquisition through videos, interactive teaching tools, and independently paced lessons.

<h3>The Cause</h3>
<p><span>Primary school in much of the developing world is free; secondary school is not. Every year, thousands of 7th grade students pass the exam qualifying them for secondary school, but are unable to complete their education due to school fees which average around $150/year.</span></p>
<p>We are a group of students from New York City hoping to help out. We became invested in this cause when <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Udacity.com</a>, a free online education website, initiated a challenge among members to recruit as many new users to the site as possible. Our recruitment team is called <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/hschallenge/team/join/agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cg0LEgRVc2VyGKKoyAUM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Team NYC</a> (click the link to join our team for free and help us achieve our goal), and we are striving to have an impact beyond just increased awareness for free, quality educational opportunities online.</p>
<p>For every class unit a Team NYC member completes on Udacity, we are raising money from sponsors across the world to help qualifying but underfinanced students in the developing world afford an education. That means you can also help us raise funding without donating yourself, by signing up for Udacity, <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/hschallenge/team/join/agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1cg0LEgRVc2VyGKKoyAUM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">joining our team</a> and completing as many units as you can. There are currently free courses with ranging difficulty taught by world-class professors about Computer Science, Science, and Mathematics. </p>
<p>But funding from these sponsors alone may not be enough to hit our goal: financing a year's worth of education for 15 deserving students who can't afford the ~$150 tuition. To truly make a difference, we need your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need roughly $2,250 to be able to pay the tuition fees of 15 students in need. We are working with <a href=""http://theschoolfund.org/cgi-bin/dyn?c=info&amp;t=fund"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The School Fund</a> to select truly outstanding students who are in desperate need of your help. All of the money we raise will go directly to these students (please note that upon donating, IndieGogo charges a small fee of their own).<strong><br/></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here is an example of the type of student you will be helping by donating to our cause:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><span>Shangwe is a student at Lugalo Secondary School graduating in 2011. He lives with his aunt and uncle because his mother died in 1998 and his father couldn't take care of him. Shangwe is an incredible student who enjoys all subjects, but he is mainly interested in physics and chemistry. Along with his best friend Yasini, Shangwe hopes to become a doctor in order to help the thousands in Tanzania who are sick and don't have access to medical help. Shangwe and Yasini do all their homework together, and put studying as their absolute top priority.</span></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't afford to contribute, there are other ways to help!

We know how it feels to be in a shelter during the holiday season but we were fortunate enough to find a vise that made us smile- hula hoops. We now hoop for Health, Happiness, Fitness and Fun.


This is the first cause my children are spearheading themselves. I am encouraging them to be humanitarians- thus being of service to others, making a difference in other peoples lives, giving without expecting anything back in return and this helps them stay humble while also cultivating compassion and sensitivity in them at an early age.

 
What we need and what you get     

  My children's goal isn't to raise a one-time sum of $500 to purchase the needed equipment and materials to make the hula hoops and other perks; the ULTIMATE goal is to get a customer base to support their business by purchasing their products and using 10% of the profits to make more gifts for less  privileged children.

** My children are youth entrepreneurs, they will be making the hula hoops, cookie dough, bath & body butters, and magnet bottle top necklaces by hand. (to read testimonials on their products please visit their facebook page by cicking on StarShineOrganics)
 
What is Hoopdancing Good For? 
My youth entrepreneurs want to get more involved with the community. They want to also be the cause of a smile. With your contributions they will be able to do just that. While we were in a shelter we lerned these facts about hula hooping- most of it from experience.

<p>Hello and thanks for visiting our campaign.  We are Alison Schofield and Francesca McGeary-educational consultants with a big idea to create a new technology-based learning platform that will provide a new model for K-12 education. </p>
<p>Our world has become collaborative and interactive.  New technologies are shaping the way that we communicate, learn and share ideas.  We now have the ability to create amazing impact in the world by harnessing technology to personalize education, distribute it openly and allow equal access for everyone.  In order to spread this learning innovation and allow it to be adopted easily and quickly, we believe that it needs to be <em>free </em>for all users. </p>
<p>This project is a not-for-profit initiative.  It will see us hire a team of experts to help develop the web-based platform and create the content. The platform will be highly flexible in that it can be incorporated into traditional schools (public, private), village communities, homeschooling families and even NGO’s.  As long as there is Internet availability, the platform can be accessed. </p>
<p>Both of us come from teaching backgrounds and have worked with diverse groups of students:  those with disabilities, gifted and talented, language-learners, children affected by war or trauma as well as mainstream students from kindergarten to high-school.  We are also entrepreneurs with our own consulting company, <em>IngeniousEd.</em>, and have managed several challenging projects and teams of people.   </p>
<p>We’ve been working on the plans and framework for this project over the last year.  We’re now ready to get the project off the ground and start funding it.  With your support and contributions, we will be able to turn our vision into a reality.  Our goal is to have a working model up-and-running after one year. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What we Need:</strong></h3>
<h3><em>Phase 1:</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $1,000,000 to develop this project on a large-scale in order to meet the goal of having a working model ready for use in one year.  We want to do it in 30 days for the maximum impact!</li>
<li>We need supporters to contribute and share this campaign with their friends, colleagues and networks.</li>
<li>We need to spread the word about this campaign across the international media and press to build awareness.  If you can help us to do this, we would greatly appreciate it.</li>
</ul><p><em> </em></p>
<h3><em>Phase 2:</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>We will create a registered, non-profit entity in order to continue to build on the project as well as create a transparent and structured framework.</li>
<li>We will develop an open-translation component where volunteers will translate content into various languages.</li>
<li>We will manage a team of volunteers to act as virtual “facilitators” to support students in their learning.</li>
<li>We will continue to explore and implement fundraising initiatives as well as look at implementing revenue models for long-term sustainability. </li>
</ul><h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Impact of the Project</strong></h2>
<p>Last year, we gave a presentation to a group of educators and asked the question, <em>“What do great organizations like Google ‘grow’?”</em>  People were quick to identify “<em>talent</em>”, “<em>product excellence</em>” and “<em>culture of innovation</em>”.  When we posed the next question, <em>“What do schools grow?”</em> people went quiet.  They could immediately recognize that schools (as-a-whole) are not talent-growing organizations, nor do they breed a “culture of innovation”.  Schools grow “test scores” but they don’t do it very effectively if you just have a look at the statistics. </p>
<p>We whole-heartedly believe that our schools and education systems could be much better.  We know that children are multi-dimensional people who should not be reduced to “test scores”.  Everyone has inherent talents and interests that need to be nurtured.  As Sir Ken Robinson said:</p>
<p><em>“We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process. And you cannot predict the outcome of human development. All you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish.” </em></p>
<p>Through our EdTech platform, we want each child to uncover their talents and flourish.  We want them to find their niche in the world and develop a love for the <em>process </em>of learning, not only the end result.  Once children have completed their K-12 learning, they will have come to understand a great deal about themselves:  their strengths, their weaknesses and where their true interests lie.  They will also have explored several types of careers first-hand through their project work and even work-placements.</p>
<p>Even children with special learning needs will be able to use our platform because it will allow them to learn at their own pace and in a way that they learn best.  Every child will have a place because we will not force “square pegs” into “round holes”.  We recognize that everyone has something to contribute to the world in their own unique way.</p>
<p>Students will learn through interesting projects that have real-world applications.  They will set their own learning paths and define their goals and outcomes.  They will use all of the technologies available to help them research, discover, create and design.  Imagine the impact on learning where one child in the USA conferences with another child in Kenya through <em>Skype</em>, to find out about “endangered species”.  The task of <em>“comparing and contrasting”</em> will take on a whole new meaning for those children.  Students will also be able to share their ideas and work with others through our built-in social network.  Their work will be assessed and monitored with the platform analytics as well as through self-assessment, peer assessment and even experts in their community.  </p>
<p>Our platform will also allow others to contribute projects.  For example, we might have a marine biologist create and submit a project about “marine biodiversity”.  With their expertise in the field, students will gain a valuable experience while the biologist also gains social value from having contributed to the education of young people.</p>
<p>We are committed to making this project happen.  With the support of like-minded people, we know that great things can happen! Please help us achieve our goal by donating whatever you can and by sharing this campaign with all of your contacts.  You can also join our <em>Facebook</em> page and <em>Twitter</em> for daily updates and more information about this Project.  Thank you for your support! </p>

We need to raise $1,000,000 to develop this project on a large-scale in order to meet the goal of having a working model ready for use in one year.  We want to do it in 30 days for the maximum impact!
We need supporters to contribute and share this campaign with their friends, colleagues and networks.
We need to spread the word about this campaign across the international media and press to build awareness.  If you can help us to do this, we would greatly appreciate it.
 
Phase 2:

We will create a registered, non-profit entity in order to continue to build on the project as well as create a transparent and structured framework.
We will develop an open-translation component where volunteers will translate content into various languages.
We will manage a team of volunteers to act as virtual “facilitators” to support students in their learning.
We will continue to explore and implement fundraising initiatives as well as look at implementing revenue models for long-term sustainability. 
 
Impact of the Project
Last year, we gave a presentation to a group of educators and asked the question, “What do great organizations like Google ‘grow’?”  People were quick to identify “talent”, “product excellence” and “culture of innovation”.  When we posed the next question, “What do schools grow?” people went quiet.  They could immediately recognize that schools (as-a-whole) are not talent-growing organizations, nor do they breed a “culture of innovation”.  Schools grow “test scores” but they don’t do it very effectively if you just have a look at the statistics. 
We whole-heartedly believe that our schools and education systems could be much better.  We know that children are multi-dimensional people who should not be reduced to “test scores”.  Everyone has inherent talents and interests that need to be nurtured.  As Sir Ken Robinson said:
“We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process; it's an organic process. And you cannot predict the outcome of human development. All you can do, like a farmer, is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish.” 
Through our EdTech platform, we want each child to uncover their talents and flourish.  We want them to find their niche in the world and develop a love for the process of learning, not only the end result.  Once children have completed their K-12 learning, they will have come to understand a great deal about themselves:  their strengths, their weaknesses and where their true interests lie.  They will also have explored several types of careers first-hand through their project work and even work-placements.
Even children with special learning needs will be able to use our platform because it will allow them to learn at their own pace and in a way that they learn best.  Every child will have a place because we will not force “square pegs” into “round holes”.  We recognize that everyone has something to contribute to the world in their own unique way.
Students will learn through interesting projects that have real-world applications.  They will set their own learning paths and define their goals and outcomes.  They will use all of the technologies available to help them research, discover, create and design.  Imagine the impact on learning where one child in the USA conferences with another child in Kenya through Skype, to find out about “endangered species”.  The task of “comparing and contrasting” will take on a whole new meaning for those children.  Students will also be able to share their ideas and work with others through our built-in social network.  Their work will be assessed and monitored with the platform analytics as well as through self-assessment, peer assessment and even experts in their community.  
Our platform will also allow others to contribute projects.  For example, we might have a marine biologist create and submit a project about “marine biodiversity”.  With their expertise in the field, students will gain a valuable experience while the biologist also gains social value from having contributed to the education of young people.
We are committed to making this project happen.  With the support of like-minded people, we know that great things can happen! Please help us achieve our goal by donating whatever you can and by sharing this campaign with all of your contacts.  You can also join our Facebook page and Twitter for daily updates and more information about this Project.  Thank you for your support!

<p>Thanks to all of you who have visited this page, we completed the Indiegogo campaign with a good head-start to keep AAE schools open.  These schools are reaching Afghan women, girls and boys who otherwise would have no chance of education.  They are truly life-changing schools as the 1007 graduates can attest.</p>
<p>Our initial $10,000 goal funds one school of 300 students for a month.  Over a period of 10 years, we have built 13 schools and a year-around curriculum, so you can see that more fund raising is required to keep all 13 schools open.  Visit our new campaign at <a href=""http://www.globalgiving.org/14518"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.globalgiving.org/14518</a> to fund all 13 schools to assure education, rebuilding of Afghanistan and freedom from terrorism.  </p>
<p><b>We must keep all 13 schools open and make up for the lack of funding as a result of cut-backs in USAID into Afghanistan.  This requires much more than the initial $10,000 mentioned in this starting goal.  </b>This campaign is only the beginning and a very important start for rebuilding peace and stabilizing Afghanistan. </p>

<p class=""yiv4502115932msonormal"">Under the current education system in Afghanistan, if a boy is 10 years old and uneducated, his future is bleak and hopeless.  There are millions of such boys in Afghanistan and they struggle to survive.  They can either sell potatoes on the streets or join the militants and become suicide bombers. </p>

<p>As I write to you, Afghanistan is still one of the poorest countries on earth. Despite gains, 72% of the Afghan population is illiterate, polio still exists though it is eradicated in almost every other country, and a woman dies every two hours from a pregnancy-related issue.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in Simcoe, Ontario.  I moved to British Columbia at the age of 19 to attend school.  However the course I selected was not for me. But I wanted to stay in BC to continue to work towards getting my Pilot License.  </p>
<p>In June 2011 I was able to start my Private Pilot License however I had to pull myself out of school due to medical reasons.   I was diagnosed with an eye disease called Keratoconus.   I was required to get two Cornea Transplants or go blind.   I was blessed to get on a short term wait list and was able to have both operations in 4 months after being put on the transplant list.  This was a very testing time for me but it taught me that I needed to put my faith and trust in God and He provided for me.  Now that my vision is corrected my goal is to continue my education and dream of being a commercial pilot.</p>
<p>I am normally not someone who would ask for donations however I have no idea where else I can turn.   I want to be able to achieve my dream of being a Pilot.   I am willing to do what I need to in order to make my dream come true.   With your help this can become possible.</p>
<h3>Why a Pilot?</h3>

</div></div>","Background
I was born and raised in Simcoe, Ontario.  I moved to British Columbia at the age of 19 to attend school.  However the course I selected was not for me. But I wanted to stay in BC to continue to work towards getting my Pilot License.  
In June 2011 I was able to start my Private Pilot License however I had to pull myself out of school due to medical reasons.   I was diagnosed with an eye disease called Keratoconus.   I was required to get two Cornea Transplants or go blind.   I was blessed to get on a short term wait list and was able to have both operations in 4 months after being put on the transplant list.  This was a very testing time for me but it taught me that I needed to put my faith and trust in God and He provided for me.  Now that my vision is corrected my goal is to continue my education and dream of being a commercial pilot.
I am normally not someone who would ask for donations however I have no idea where else I can turn.   I want to be able to achieve my dream of being a Pilot.   I am willing to do what I need to in order to make my dream come true.   With your help this can become possible.
Why a Pilot?
The reason that becoming a Pilot is such a strong passion for me is because ever since I was a child I have had a fascination with flying.   This has been my dream for years, I have been thrown road blocks however have been able to overcome those and continue to push towards my ultimate goal to be a Pilot.
The School
The School I have decided to go to is British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT).   The course is 64 weeks long and starts May 2013 Here is a link to the program that I will be attending.  http://www.bcit.ca/study/programs/1005dipts#overview
With this program I will get not only my Commercial License but I will also get my Multi-Engine Rating, Instrument Rating all things that are required to get a job as a Commercial Pilot.


What I Need
Here is a breakdown of what I need:
BCIT Tutition      -    $10,000
Flying Hours        -   $50,000
Living Expense    -   $12,000
Total                             $72,000
I am able to get some money from the government as a student loan.
Government Student Loan $21,000
Bank Student Loan           $20,000 (based on a 2 year course)
Total                               $41,000
So after the loans I have available to me I still need to come up with another $31,000 before January 2013.
If I am unable to raise enough money to get into the program for 2013 I will continue to work for a year to raise the rest of the money and go to school in 2014.    
 


The Impact
What your contributions mean to me:
Even if it is only a $5.00 donation anything will help bring me closer to my goal of being able to afford school. 
I have overcome hurdles in my life with the grace of God.   I strongly believe that God will provide for me in this avenue as He has done in the rest of the areas of my life.
I thank you for looking at this page and wish you the best.
God Bless,
Kory

<p><strong>Our Mission:</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to financially support educational opportunities for Tibetan refugee youth in India and expand cultural competency for a national audience of art therapists. We will do this by sponsoring the creation of a stunning Tibetan Sand Mandala at the American Art Therapy Association’s 44<sup>th</sup> annual conference in June of 2013. By presenting culturally diverse programming at this national conference, we will educate a spectrum of helping professionals about art as a form of social action, increase their cultural competency, and share an incredible and ephemeral sacred art form with a wide audience in the name of creating educational opportunities for refugee youth. </p>
<p><strong>Here’s how we’re doing it: </strong></p>
<p>The Evergreen Art Therapy Association (EATA) of Washington State has invited a Tibetan monk, the Venerable Ngawang Chojor, from the Tibetan Children’s Educational Foundation (TCEF) to create a sand mandala in support of TCEF’s programs in India since 1998.</p>
<p>Through collaboration and grassroots efforts, both organizations have worked tirelessly to bring a Tibetan Sand Mandala to the 44th Annual AATA conference, with the support of the American Art Therapy Association. The mandala will be created and ritually destroyed over a 3-day period, and witnessed by more than 1,000 helping professionals. All proceeds will benefit TCEF's programming.</p>
<p><strong>Who are TCEF and EATA?</strong></p>
<p>TCEF provides educational infrastructure, individual sponsorship, and cultural preservation efforts for refugee communities in India. Through service learning and study abroad trips to India and national US tours for Tibetan artists, TCEF raises awareness and empowers individuals through the power and magnetism of cultural art.  EATA exists to support continuing educational opportunities for art therapists by providing communities access to art-making, professional development, and participation in art focused experiences in Washington State. Both EATA and TCEF have 501(c)3 non-profit status.</p>
<p><strong>How did this project develop?</strong></p>
<p>In the fall of 2011, Alyssa Griskiewicz, TCEF Board Member and Antioch Art Therapy Master's candidate completed an ambitious and totally radical Master's Project, entitled: Art as Social Action in the Preservation of Tibetan Culture: Creating Positive Social Change through Global Leadership and Service Learning . </p>
<p>This project was developed to integrate aspects of art, social action, cultural competency, and community involvement at Antioch University Seattle. Specifically, the project coordinator sought to use emic displays of Tibetan cultural art to broaden the scope and visibility of Tibetan Children’s Education Foundation. A four day consortium was held at Antioch University Seattle and was offered free to the public. The event included the creation and destruction of a Tibetan sand mandala, artist workshops and demonstrations, lectures and a panel discussion, exhibitions, fundraisers, community art-making opportunities, and dramatic performances. The event was successful in benefitting a number of populations and organizations, and raising awareness about a grave and serious social-justice issue through the dynamic and healing power of art. A model for replication of art-based social action was developed for ease of replication of similar events. The consortium was successful in raising more than $7,000 for TCEF’s national and international programming.</p>
<p>When the 2013 AATA conference came around to Seattle, organizers approached Alyssa, with the support of EATA, to replicate the event for a national audience. Boom.</p>
<p><strong>Importance of our campaign: </strong></p>
<p>TCEF is the premiere education based non-profit organization in the United States for Tibetan youth, providing a spectrum of services to refugee communities in India and service learning opportunities to its network of supporters and volunteers. TCEF’s work has been recognized and supported by His Holiness the 14<sup>th</sup> Dalai Lama. </p>
<p>Some of TCEF’s projects include: individual educational sponsorships for youth, a monastic school lunch program providing 34 lunches to school-children six days a week; building educational infrastructure in refugee communities, a grandparent sponsorship program for Tibetan elders, and service learning and study abroad trips in India.  </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Let's break it on down:</p>
<p>Our initial budget of $8,500 includes: artists' fees for our monastic artisans, transnational travel expenses, four days room and board in Seattle for the Tibetan monk, and organizational fees for TCEF support staff, postage for sending out our unforgettable thank you mementos, and costs associated with presenting a master class at the conference by Harvard Fulbright Scholar Karma Tensum. </p>
<p>Through various grassroots efforts and generous anonymous donations, and direct sponsorship from EATA and Antioch University, we have chipped away at our goal, but we need your support! We are anticipating a fabulous turnout and addtional funds from a Mandala Auction on May 19, 2013.</p>
<p>Purchase tickets for the Mandala Auction here: <a href=""http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/372390"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/372390</a></p>
<p>We have already secured more than $6,500 towards our goal through contributions from student fundraising, EATA, Antioch University Seattle, AATA, and individual donors, but we need your support to make this all of our efforts a success!</p>
<p>All anticipated funds will directly benefit TCEF and their efforts to provide educational opportunities to refugee youth, preserve Tibetan culture, and improve educational infrastructure in refugee communities. By presenting this event at a national conference, the funds will help to create a more sustainable and far reaching network of TCEF supporters and raise awareness about the important work we do.</p>
<p>Our creative community is providing MAJOR PERKS to show our gratitude and investment in your support. From images of the completed mandala, to one-of-a-kind artwork, to actual grains of sand from the 2013 mandala, your cash donations will be reciprocated with our heartfelt gratitude and super-awesome artwork. </p>
<p>All donations beyond our goal will support associated conference costs for EATA volunteer support staff and direct funding of TCEF's programming in India.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This campaign is valuable to individuals around the world, on a number of different levels.</p>
<p>TCEF has been committed to education and cultural preservation since 1998 through grassroots campaigning and individual sponsorship. By taking Tibetan artisans on national tours, TCEF has successfully raised funds, awareness, and increased the visibility of a compassionate and endangered culture.</p>
<p>For AATA conference participants, the Seattle Art as Social Action event will provide an opportunity to bear witness to and learn about an authentic, sacred, healing art form from an incredible cultural tradition. This experience will promote growth as compassionate professionals and directly support efforts towards healing and empowerment in communities across the globe.  </p>
<p>This will be the FIRST TIME TCEF presents its incredible work and the ritual creation and destruction of a sacred sand mandala at a national conference. Please be a part of this momentous event. </p>

Thai Freedom House, a wonderful organization that I am volunteering for 
here in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Thai Freedom House is a non-government, 
not-for-profit, language and 
arts community learning center in Northern Thailand dedicated to 
assisting families and individuals who are refugees from Burma and 
members of minority groups of Thailand. As a result of severe military 
oppression, many Burmese people have fled to Thailand to seek asylum. 
But they are far from free once they cross over the border, as they are 
met only with work exploitation, gang violence, and police harassment. 
With limited rights, and severe negative social perceptions, these 
refugees are often forced to accept low-paying, dangerous jobs, that 
provide inadequate financial support. The result is a viscous cycle of 
poverty for the refugees and their families. Education is certainly a 
key to breaking free from these poor living conditions, but 
unfortunately the Thai government makes it increasingly difficult for 
Burmese citizens to receive a proper education. </p><p>That is where
 Thai Freedom House steps in, offering hope in the form of sanctuary and
 education. It is a place that strives to give the children of these 
refugees a fair shot at a positive future. With classes in English, 
Thai, Shan, Burmese, Chinese, and the arts, these children can 
realistically acquire the skills and resources needed to progress beyond
 unskilled labor. In addition to language and arts classes, refugees are
 taught how to interact in Thai society, to reduce instances of 
discrimination and trouble with police. It also serves as a 
transportation hub for supplies and clothing to be distributed to 
Burmese construction camps throughout Northern Thailand. But really, 
Thai Freedom House serves as a place of peace and happiness for refugees
 who face tremendous hardship on a daily basis. It is a place where they
 can simply just have fun, be who they are, and not have to worry about 
the troubles of life. I have been here two weeks, and can already see 
the magnitude of its positive influence on these wonderful people's 
lives. </p><p>For the month of March, I will be volunteering at the 
Thai Freedom House helping out wherever I am needed. It has already been
 quite busy for me, but the reward has been worth every second of my 
time. I have helped teach English, Art, and Geography. I have worked 
with some of the Burmese students-turned-faculty on developing their 
computer skills. I have done at least 10,000 dishes (or at least it 
feels like it!) to help out in their fund raising restaurant, the Free 
Bird Cafe. And my biggest contribution to date, has been planning a 
'Sports Day' for the kids to get out and enjoy the structure, teamwork, 
and thrill, that comes with organized sports. In order to make events 
like Sports Day a possibility, Thai Freedom House needs funding. As 
noted above, it is a non-government organization, which means funding 
comes primarily from donations, as well as the recently set-up free bird
 cafe. That is why I am setting up this page, to help raise as much 
money as possible to see that a great organization is not slowed down by
 lack of finances. Any amount you can afford to give, will go a very 
long way. Your donation will go towards providing school supplies, art 
supplies, meals for children, and the sporting equipment necessary to 
make Sports Day, and future Sports Days, a huge success. Thank you in 
advance for all of your time and help. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>-Danny Monckton</p><br/><p></p></div>","Hello Friends and Family,I am raising funds to help support

 cafe. That is why I am setting up this page, to help raise as much 
money as possible to see that a great organization is not slowed down by
 lack of finances. Any amount you can afford to give, will go a very 
long way. Your donation will go towards providing school supplies, art 
supplies, meals for children, and the sporting equipment necessary to 
make Sports Day, and future Sports Days, a huge success. Thank you in 
advance for all of your time and help. -Danny Monckton",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","Update as of August 18, 2014:  
I would like to thank those who have already contributed to the campaign and we will be contacting you soon to refund your contribution.  We would also like to tell any new, would-be contributors to please withhold their donation to ""this"" campaign.


If you would still like to help, there are two more ""turtleback"" cars that are slated to be discarded if they do not find a home.  Our friends at the North Texas Historic Transportation and Traction Company are trying to raise funds to save these other two cars.  They are also the same organization that acquired the car we were trying to save.  Here is a link to their campaign:
https://www.facebook.com/savetheturtlebacks/timeline  
Our goal was to save a rare historic trolley that ran in Dallas, Texas and we were working with the McKinney Avenue Transit Authority in Dallas to acquire the car.  To our surprise, they found a local historical group in the Dallas area to save and restore the car.  It is great news that the car will be saved and it is also fortunate that the car is going to stay in the area where it has historical ties.  Unfortunately for us, we need to end our campaign to collect contributions to save this car.  Again, thank you to all who have contributed and shared our campaign with your friends and associates.

Best Regards,
Nathan Wells



Campaign as it was:

Seeking funds to acquire and save historic Car 323, a rare ""stretched turtleback"" trolley that ran on the streets of Dallas, Texas. 
 

Car 323 is the last known surviving car of its kind in the world!   Car 323 is a 13-window ""turtleback"" streetcar manufactured by the American Car Company for Stone and Webster   to run on its Dallas streetcar system.  The ""turtleback"" trolley derives its name from its unique appearance of looking like a turtle with its head sticking out of its shell.  The standard ""turtleback"" trolleys were built with 10 side windows.  Car 323 is one of the few ""stretched turtleback""  streetcars built with 13 windows per side.  The ""stretched turtleback"" was built to handle a higher capacity of passengers.  It is the ""stretched"" or 13 windows that makes Car 323 so rare that it is the only known surviving ""stretched turtleback"" trolley in the world!
Originally, McKinney Avenue Transit Authority   (MATA), a heritage streetcar company based in Dallas, TX,  rescued Car 323 and preserved it for future restoration.  MATA has decided it no longer requires the car.  They are offering the streetcar to our group if we can move it before the beginning of September 2014. The streetcar is currently sitting on a lot that has been sold to a third party.  If Car 323 is not moved by September, Car 323 may be scrapped along with its 100 year history and status as the last known surviving ""stretched turtleback"" streetcar in the world!  
We are seeking $10,000 to pay for the shipping of Car 323 from Dallas, TX to Charlotte, NC.  
If you would like to help save Car 323, contribute $$ AND share our campaign with your friends.
Thank You for Your Support!

<h3><b>Where does your funding go?  </b></h3>
<p></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Cameras and audio recorders:  </b>Our focus is on evidence-based storytelling in visual forms.   In the first level, we buy a camera for every student and allow them to keep them upon completion of their stories.  We've collectively learned the importance of good sound quality and purchase audio recorders that are shared within communities.  In the second level, the students work with more advanced equipment in production teams, led by our youth leaders.  </li>
<li>
<b>Computers: </b>The students are enjoying learning technology, yet we don't have enough computers.  We need computer resources so that our students can continue to explore creative and editing software and learn new skills.  With computers and software we can provide participants with editing kits accessible for both first and second level students.  </li>
<li>
<b>Youth Leader Salaries:</b> As youth ""graduate"" from their first level experience with making documentaries, they apply to become leaders.  These leaders then teach and support new groups of students.  Giving youth stipend apprenticeships supports local responsibility, leadership, and project ownership.</li>
<li>
<b>Cultural Excursions: </b>We have cultural excursions at least 4 times a year that aim to strengthen cultural awareness and inter-community connectedness. In July, we traveled to Quiche, Guatemala, where the youth heard the history of their migration and participated in a Maya Ceremony prepared by a respected elder in the community. More excursions are planned to deepen youth's connection to their cultures, and they'll be documented through youth video.</li>
<li>
<b>Workshops and Travel: </b>With our youth leaders, we conduct local workshops in each community as well as conjoint workshops that gather all the youth together.  We pay for their travel, lodging, supervision and food so that they can travel to work together with youth across communities.  </li>

<p></p>
<h3><b>How do we work? </b></h3>
<p><b>Partnerships!</b> USH works in partnership with existing organizations that have similar goals of facilitating local leadership and local sustainability. These established organizations have worked tirelessly to create trusting relationships with families and youth, which is essential to the success of this work.</p>
<p><b>Maya Traditions Chapter:</b> We began this work in partnership with <a href=""http://www.mayatraditions.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maya Traditions Foundation</a> (MTF). Maya Traditions Foundation works to empower and improve the quality of life for Maya women artisans and their families through facilitating international market access and through educational social programs. Our partnership is entitled Unlocking Silent Histories: Maya Traditions Chapter.  The youth currently participating in and assisting in creating the growth of USH are also participants in MTF’s Youth Education Program and many are children of MTF's partner artisans.  MTF also supports the program through its material and human resources.</p>
<p><b>ADECCAP Chapter:  </b>USH is in the final stages of solidifying a partnership with ADECCAP, an organization under indigenous Maya leadership in Santiago Atitlán. The purpose of ADECCAP is to strengthen spaces for youth participation, promoting processes of formation and capacity-building to give opportunities to young people in their social, economic, political and cultural development, in order to exercise responsible and critical citizenship, with gender equity and cultural relevance, within a framework of environmental risk management for a holistic approach to community development. </p>

Learning & leadership for indigenous youth who participate in...  Unlocking Silent Histories!  





Who we are

Unlocking Silent Histories (USH) is a non-profit organization  that began working with indigenous youth in the Lake Atitlán region of Guatemala. Our organization is dedicated to cultivating educational spaces for indigenous youth to express their ideas and identities through the creation of documentary shorts. Through the art of filmmaking, the students capture aspects of their cultures that they identify as most important to examine, document, and share with local and global communities. Since our start in December 2012, 22 students participating in the Maya Traditions education program, completed documentary shorts.  Four of these students became program leaders and now teach and help envision the  future of USH.  


Why?   To support indigenous youth learning opportunities that lead to critical and creative media expression, amplifying their voices and identities, and honoring their cultural and linguistic heritages.



The Benefits for Indigenous Youth & Its Importance



Critical thinking skills: limited in formalized schooling in these villages


Technology skills: learning critical 21st Century Skills


Youth empowerment: youth direct their learning & take on leadership roles


The voices of indigenous peoples continue to be absent from the escalating digital landscape. Having youth broadcast their perspectives through digital documentaries is an effort to close this gap. By self-directing their inquiry and deciding how they choose to participate in a digital world, our students develop a sense of identify, self-awareness and community leadership.




Where does your funding go?  




Cameras and audio recorders:  Our focus is on evidence-based storytelling in visual forms.   In the first level, we buy a camera for every student and allow them to keep them upon completion of their stories.  We've collectively learned the importance of good sound quality and purchase audio recorders that are shared within communities.  In the second level, the students work with more advanced equipment in production teams, led by our youth leaders.  

Computers: The students are enjoying learning technology, yet we don't have enough computers.  We need computer resources so that our students can continue to explore creative and editing software and learn new skills.  With computers and software we can provide participants with editing kits accessible for both first and second level students.  

Youth Leader Salaries: As youth ""graduate"" from their first level experience with making documentaries, they apply to become leaders.  These leaders then teach and support new groups of students.  Giving youth stipend apprenticeships supports local responsibility, leadership, and project ownership.

Cultural Excursions: We have cultural excursions at least 4 times a year that aim to strengthen cultural awareness and inter-community connectedness. In July, we traveled to Quiche, Guatemala, where the youth heard the history of their migration and participated in a Maya Ceremony prepared by a respected elder in the community. More excursions are planned to deepen youth's connection to their cultures, and they'll be documented through youth video.

Workshops and Travel: With our youth leaders, we conduct local workshops in each community as well as conjoint workshops that gather all the youth together.  We pay for their travel, lodging, supervision and food so that they can travel to work together with youth across communities.  




How do we work? 
Partnerships! USH works in partnership with existing organizations that have similar goals of facilitating local leadership and local sustainability. These established organizations have worked tirelessly to create trusting relationships with families and youth, which is essential to the success of this work.
Maya Traditions Chapter: We began this work in partnership with Maya Traditions Foundation (MTF). Maya Traditions Foundation works to empower and improve the quality of life for Maya women artisans and their families through facilitating international market access and through educational social programs. Our partnership is entitled Unlocking Silent Histories: Maya Traditions Chapter.  The youth currently participating in and assisting in creating the growth of USH are also participants in MTF’s Youth Education Program and many are children of MTF's partner artisans.  MTF also supports the program through its material and human resources.
ADECCAP Chapter:  USH is in the final stages of solidifying a partnership with ADECCAP, an organization under indigenous Maya leadership in Santiago Atitlán. The purpose of ADECCAP is to strengthen spaces for youth participation, promoting processes of formation and capacity-building to give opportunities to young people in their social, economic, political and cultural development, in order to exercise responsible and critical citizenship, with gender equity and cultural relevance, within a framework of environmental risk management for a holistic approach to community development. 











Our Successes


Documentaries: Four Communities and 18 films
Youth Leadership: We have hired four youth leaders to direct the Maya Traditions Chapter 
Youth Growth: Our students have shown great personal and leadership development through participation in our program: the once shy Emilio is now class president; Carmen changed her focus of study from farming to community building; Youth are traveling outside their communities for the first time and being introduced to Maya cultural practices that they had before not experienced.  

Presentations: The films have been presented in Guatemala (Youth communities and Panajachel) and in the US (including the Austin Film Society)
Spreading the word: Our youth leaders have presented USH to other youth groups in surrounding communities such as Santiago Atitlán and Nebaj.  

Invitations to Film: The technological skills and unique perspectives of our youth are opening new doors for them. One of our youth leaders was invited to document a Tribal Gathering in Panama.  


Cultural Connection:  In addition to learning more about various connections between the history and the present, a Maya Spiritual Guide and Historian led our excisions to Quiche (to provide the youth with their first historical lesson about the migration of their ancestors from Quiche to Lake Atitlán) and to Iximche (to hear the history of the colonization from an indigenous perspective).  






Awards


Adobe Youth Voices: The youth have been invited to participate in  competition, and are learning deeper critical, technical, and production skills.

Pollination Project:  USH received a small grant from the Pollination Project to begin our youth leaders program!

GOOD INC:  USH was recognized in GOODInc. as one of the top 100 ""Do Good"" project of 2014.

We strive to create learning
experiences that:





Amplify the voices and identities of
indigenous youth and their communities by supporting them to direct and produce
their own documentaries.  


Invite youth to explore personally
meaningful curiosities and concerns in order to connect learning
to their lives.  


Value and encourage using their local

their peers.  


Share films with peers within

Develop local youth leadership to
ensure sustainability of the project(s) 

Our work is motivated by the
arguments that:



Historically, foreigners have created
media representations of indigenous peoples to construct and perpetuate
stereotypes about them and their lives.    


Current educational practices are
culturally distanced from indigenous cultures, inhibiting them from critically
and creatively expressing themselves.  


Languages are being lost at a rate of
one language every two weeks, and this threat is acutely felt by indigenous
peoples.  


Indigenous youth have limited
opportunities to engage in educational experiences that honor their cultural

We have already made it to 99% of our goal to send WAM staff and interns to the Audio Engineering Society Convention in Los Angeles! Thanks to you, we will be able to connect with women in audio from all over the world next month.</p>
<p>The work doesn't stop there. Help us surpass our original goal so that we can sponsor underserved girls (93% low income, 30-40% high school drop out rate) in our Girl's on the Mic program this semester. <strong>$1,000 will provide a free semester of training for 10 middle school girls in the Girls on the Mic program</strong>. Can you help sponsor one of these girls? Any donation amount will help create new opportunities and career/education paths for the girls that need it the most.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for believing in WAM!</p>

<h2>What is WAM?</h2>
<p><strong>Women's Audio Mission </strong>is a San Francisco-based, non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of women in music production and the recording arts. In a field where women are critically under-represented (less than 5%), WAM is ""changing the face of sound"" by training over 1,200 women and girls in a year in music technology and media production in the only professional recording studio built and run entirely by women and girls. WAM believes that women's mastery of music technology and inclusion in the production process will expand the vision and voice of media and popular culture.</p>
<h2>Why Send WAM to AES?</h2>
<p>The Audio Engineering Society Convention (AES) is the <strong>largest gathering of audio professionals in the world, with over 18,000 attendees, uniting engineers, creative artists, scientists and students worldwide. </strong><br/><br/>It's also the <strong>most important event of the year for WAM</strong>. WAM reaches the largest number of women in audio at AES, from new students to industry veterans. AES allows WAM to connect women to our programs and help them with networking, internships, jobs, and more!</p>
<p> WAM has attended the conference every year since 2004. AES generously donates a booth to us every year, so we can provide a place for women to connect, network, and get hooked into WAM's programs and services. But first we need to get our WAM team to Los Angeles!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why WAM Needs to be at AES This Year</h2>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The WAM Booth provides a critical ""homebase"" for women attendees to <strong>meet, connect, and network</strong> with other women and industry professionals;</li>

We are competing in a Basic Utility Vehicle competition to fulfill our senior project. The competition is centered on the goal of designing a cheap, reproducible vehicle that could serve multiple purposes for a community in a third-world nation. Once the competition has ended, the vehicles that complete the competition are donated to a country in Africa or Latin America. Your donations will go towards designing the vehicle and funding the travel expenses for the team to travel to Ohio for the competition. </span></p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul>
<div>Our goal is to raise $5000 to ensure that we can successfully build a prototype of our BUV and travel to Ohio as a team to compete. The goal for the competition is to design a Basic Utility Vehicle that can be used for agriculture or community-based needs and can be reproduced for less than $2500. The prototype will be built in the next few months. Following the build, we will travel as a team to Ohio to participate in the competition to prove that our vehicle can perform the required actions, such as carrying water and traveling over challenging terrain. If we are successful in the competition, our vehicle will be donated to a community in Africa or Latin America. </div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul>
<div>This competition is put on by the Institute for Affordable Transportation. They produce their design of the Basic Utility Vehicle and ship them to countries throughout Africa and Latin America. The purpose for the competition is two fold: to inspire university students to work towards helping others and to push for new ideas to improve their BUV design. Each competition is structured around the innovations the competing teams bring with their designs. Your donations will enable us to design the fuel-efficient and simplistic design that we are striving towards. </div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul>
<div>This project is filled with risks. We have less than three months to build and test our prototype. We have to travel to Ohio and endure multiple tests including a 8 and 1/2 hour race to complete as many laps of the course as possible, while loading and unloading water regularly. We will design a vehicle that will be able to endure these challenges and it will be finished by the competition date on April 17.</div>

<h3>The undergraduate student project, alterNATIVE education is requesting $10,000 to pay for travel and per diem for ten students to provide a week-long peer-education and mentorship program for high school students  this summer on three reservations in New Mexico.</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>WHO WE ARE </p>
<p>AlterNATIVE Education is the first Native, intercollegiate, peer-education and mentorship initiative/organization aimed at bridging the gap between NATIVE [american] Highschool and NATIVE college students.  </p>
<p>AlterNATIVE Education was formed by us, 10 undergraduates of Columbia University. We represent 12 Native nations and non-Native allies. <br/><br/>After learning about Native education in our own communities and communities across the nation, we believe that a 61% high school graduation rate among Native Americans is everyone's concern: every community's, every individual's, every educator's, every [grand]parent's, cousin's and friend's. AlterNATIVE Education is not the answer, but it is our vision of a moment when we stop lamenting statistics and begin doing something about them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT WE DO </p>
<p>We have developed a week-long summer curriculum for high school students to be provided at no cost to participating tribes or volunteers; this curriculum is aimed at <strong>Engaging</strong> students with Native histories, Native governments, Native arts and Native <br/>current events, topics that are not talked about often enough in the classroom; <strong>Empowering</strong> Native students as community members, as individuals, as agents of change; and finally, <strong>Encouraging</strong> Native students to seriously consider pursuing higher education. We will do this through:</p>
<p><strong>Mentorship</strong> <br/>Fostering on-going mentorship relationships between high-school students and ourselves as college students is our first and foremost goal. These relationships formed in the summer week will continue beyond the program through correspondences, programming, and collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Native education</strong> <br/>Getting students to engage with the History, Present, &amp; Future of Native Presence, Action, &amp; movements for change. We will read primary sources, artistic interpretations, and critically look at contemporary representations of Native peoples.</p>
<p><strong>Community project</strong><br/>Working with individual communities/nations/tribes, we will collaborate with Native students to create a service project that the students will lead, execute, and continue beyond the week-long session.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>LONG TERM GOALS </p>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong> <br/>Because on-going mentorship with students is our primary goal, facilitating lasting relationships between these students and the ten students here and now is fundamental. <br/>Beyond that we hope to maintain relationships with the 3 original tribes, returning year after year, engaging new mentors, new mentees, and reinforcing relationships already made. <br/><strong>Expansion</strong> <br/>We hope to expand on-the-ground efforts to more tribes, creating chapters at more universities, always at no cost to the participants and their families.<br/>We further would like to launch an online accessibility, where individual students, tribes, parents, cousins, and community leaders might reach out, access and support AlterNATIVE Education.</p>

<p>Hi I’m Dr. Ural Hill  a minister of the gospel of Jesus Christ and a Licensed Professional Counselor. I am also the President of Healing Ourselves through Escellence and Preparation (H.O.T.E.P.)

<p>We’ve been working with teenagers who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and their families for the past year. They have a difficult time concentrating, performing well in school, at home and in their communities. Many times their behavior is mistaken for character flaws but they have low levels of dopamine in their brain’s limbic systems which makes it difficult for them to make logical and rational decisions. We teach these families conflict resolution strategies and how to parent children and adolescents with ADHD. We found that by educating their families on parenting strategies that work, making sure that they have been prescribed the correct medications and teaching them strategies of maximizing effective decision making, their disorder can be managed. During the school year we provide facilitation in their schools with the administration to make sure these kids have the proper accommodations afforded them by law. These same ""problem"" kids can live productive and focused lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From July 2012 to March 2013 we treated 7 teenagers and their families who were all faced with these behavioral challenges. After  9 months 5 of the families are functioning very well and the young men are doing well in school, at home and in the communities. The counseling services that we provided were paid for through a pilot project of our local county government, however the county ran out of funding and contract ended in March. There are now two families that still need and have requested our help and two new families requesting our assistance. We the members of HOTEP, our 501(c)3 non-profit organization give God the Glory for the success of the first five families and we're believing that we can raise the money to assist these new five families this summer. Your help will allow us to provide much need mental health services and family counseling to indigent families who would not otherwise get this assistance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need $5,000 in order to serve them throughout the summer and to prepare them for the next school year. We will provide:</p>
<p>5 psychotherapeutic counseling sessions each month, 2 individual &amp; 1 family session both @ $50 cost and $100 value , 1 parenting session and 1 group social skills outing both @ $200 cost and $300 value.</p>
<p>That’s $550 X 4 families for the cost of therapy X 2 Months July and August of 2013, $4,400</p>
<p>The other $600 will go to gasoline and refreshments for group sessions, group outings for the parents and kids.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal it means that we cannot serve as many families. We are already serving two families out of our pockets with one session per week. We really need you help so that we can give them a full educative summer. In Our Family Hope Pilot Program we found that when we provide the five sessions to each family, each month that we increase the quality of life greatly by their own report; and reduce the recidivism rate by 70% helping these young men to stay out of trouble and thus out of the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>In today’s there is a New Jim Crow and It’s the Prison Industrial Complex in a Colorblind Society. HOTEP means Peace. Our Program Helps keep our kids engaged, safe and hopeful. It helps them to choose positive, peaceful and productive pathways for life.</p></div>","HOTEP’s Summer Peace Program

That's tomorrow!Those of you who have backed the campaign at the Founding Member level and above get into the party for free! Check out the details here: http://goo.gl/NGLfu5   UPDATE 11/30: Utah's Leaders Rally Behind Impact HubLast week Impact Hub Salt Lake hosted Utah's prominent business, community, and political leaders for a night of thanksgiving. In typical Impact Hub fashion, guests enjoyed live music, locally-sourced hors d'oeuvres, and hand-crafted cocktails. Mayor Ben McAdams displayed his ardent support for Impact Hub Salt Lake and issued a call-to-action for us all: ignite our entrepreneurial ecosystem now!   UPDATE 11/16: Launch Party HUGE Success!Our Crowdfunding Launch Party was better than we could have ever imagined! We raised over $10K, brought in a diverse audience of over 500 people from the greater Salt Lake area, and raffled off some wonderful giveaways from local sponsors. A huge ""THANK YOU"" is owed to our bands for the evening: Pablo Blaqk and The War Byrds, Luna Lune, and Westward The Tide.If you had a great time at this party, look forward to our ""We Did It"" party on Dec 12. Get it on your calendar now!    ABOUT IMPACT HUB SALT LAKEWe are an open work space, event venue, and innovation lab for people with a purpose.On the surface Impact Hub is an open work space where people just like you - whether you're an entrepreneur, freelancer, or other breed of changemaker - conduct business, hold meetings, teach workshops, host events, design products, and even prepare lunch in our community kitchen.At its heart though, Impact Hub is much more. As an entrepreneurial incubator and community accelerator, Impact Hub provides a diverse range of programming through workshops, classes, and cultural events for mission-driven teams and individuals. Community building is further facilitated through a robust ""hosting"" program, in which Impact Hub hosts connect community members with shared interests and goals to one another. This ensures that Impact Hub is more than just a space, but is a truly collaborative community where creativity and innovation are more than just a topic of conversation, but are actually happening.Located in the heart of downtown Salt Lake City, Impact Hub Salt Lake is part of a global network of more than 40 Impact Hubs. This gives you access to an incredible amount of intellectual resources, experience, and diverse insights allowing you to amplify your effect in the local community and leave your mark on the world.Impact Hub Salt Lake is locally owned and operated by a vibrant and talented team with diverse backgrounds. Read more details about the team, and Impact Hub in general, below the Donor Rewards cheat sheet.         IT'S MORE THAN A SPACE TO WORK    Impact Hub Salt Lake members are more than co-workers, they are a tribe, a group of people connected by a common purpose. In this case, the purpose is positive social and sustainable impact in our local community, and the world at large.Members not only connect on values, but support one another by lending time, leading workshops, hosting events, expressing themselves through art, music, and dance, providing funding and mentorship, launching companies, and prototyping the future.LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATIONThis is the fundamental rule of real estate and we're sticking to it. Impact Hub Salt Lake is located in the heart of the downtown commercial district at 150 South State Street, in the historic Zim’s building.   Not only are Utah's leading thinkers and doers located in the downtown area, Impact Hub is also right in the middle of Salt Lake's public transit hub. We’re less than a block away from City Creek Center and approximately one block away from the Gallivan and City Center UTA Trax stops.There are over 1,000 parking spaces within 300 feet for our member's convenience. Additionally our location will provide bicycle storage and motorcycle/scooter parking on site. Impact Hub Salt Lake is lucky to have its very own architect and urban designer on the founding team, Søren Simonsen.

<p>My name is Alex de Guzman and in August 2012, I did what most people only see in movies...kind of. I quit my job and left all that I loved...friends, family, language, culture, and sport. On top of that, I will be running my first marathon on April 28th in Madrid, Spain. A sport I used to dread. Go figure.</p>

Así mismo, me dispongo a correr mi pimera maratón el 28 de abril en Madrid (España). Un deporte que solía odiar...imaginaos.</p>

<p><strong>""The future depends on what you do today."" ~<em>Gandhi</em></strong></p>
<p><span>My campaign is called ""Race for the Future."" I did my first race, a half-marathon, 3 years ago with a few friends. With the help of friends, family, a small start-up called UpCycle Foundation, and Terracyle we were able to raise $800, dontate clothes, and backpacks filled with school supplies, made out of recycled material. With that money, Baruyand Elementary School was able to build a volleyball court which they not only use for sports but for other school events. Those have been ""the greates gifts we have ever received.""~Lorie Hatulan, principal of Baruyan<br/></span></p>
<p><span>My belief is that kids will forever be our future. I've always been fascinated at how obsercant, real, and fun kids truly are. Teaching tennis to young ones has not only kept me grounded and in touch with reality but has also showed how much of an impact you cna have on their future. Since moving to Spain and working with students, I've realized even more how much kids want to learn, especially English. What separates most schools from the rest and their ability to truly succeed is ften times their lack of funding.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>After talking to Lorie Hatulan, what the students really need is an ""LCD projector to meet quality education and for the pupils to compete globally."" This costs about 20,000 pesos; which may seem like a lot but in dollars it's $400. My hope is to provide more.<br/></span></p>

<p><span>Mi campaña se llama ""Carrera por el Futuro"". Hice mi primera carrera, una media maratón, hace tres años con un puñado de amigos. Con la ayda de familiares, amigos, la pequeña e innovadora Fundación UpCycle, y Terracycle fuimos capaces de recaudar casi 1000 dólares, donar ropa y mochilas repletas de material escolar reciclado. Con esos fondos la Escuela Primaria Baruyan fue capaz de construir una pista de voleibol que usan tanto para deportes como para todo tipo de eventos. Lori Hatulan los ha descrito como los ""mejores regalos que hemos recibido"".</span></p>
<p><span>Creo firmemente que los niños serán por siempre nuestro futuro. Siempre he sentido una fasinación por la perspicacia, honestidad, y simpatía que los niños transmiten. Enseñar tenis a jóvenes no solo me ha mantenido con los pies en el suelp y en contacto con realidad, si no que también me ha demostrado cuánto impacto se puede tener en su futuro. Desde que me he trasladado a España para trabajar con estudiantes me he dado cuenta, aún más si cabe, de su deseo de aprender, especialmente el ingés.

<p><span>Tras hablar con Lori Hatulan, la directora de la escuela, decidimos que para mejorar la calidad de la educación y mejorar la de sus estudiantes con otras escuelas, se necesita un proyector LCD.

</h3><p>In February of 2014, I voluntarily separated from my employer to pursue more purposeful work where I can apply my skills, strengths and experiences to tackling societal needs that affect us all as humans. To kick start this new path in the right direction, I took a chance and paid my way to attend Ashoka U in Providence, RI a few weeks after leaving my promising corporate career path. <br/></p><p>That decision has set me on a path to designing the life I want in order to make a difference in the world around me through my social entrepreneurship. It was at this conference where I learned about the The Emzingo Group and their international fellowship programs. After learning about the great social impact, consulting work and responsible leadership development training, I knew I had to apply. So I took another chance by applying and ultimately being accepted. Now the challenges lays in how I fund this. Because it is unfunded and unpaid, I am going to have to really exhaust my savings to go, which I am willing to do because I know deep down in my core that this is a major step in the direction I want to lead my life. <br/></p><p>This fellowship is important to me because I can now take my abilities to an international stage and show the world what I can do. After many years of learning through the school of hard knocks, I am a finely tuned innovating machine. I welcome you to visit my site, <a href=""http://www.TheEnvisioneer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.TheEnvisioneer.com</a> to learn more about me and what I am all about. <br/></p><p>I really do not know what to expect to come from this fellowship but I can only imagine that upon my return, I will be well on my way to establishing myself as a global entrepreneurial force for good.</p><p>Your support in funding my fellowship will go towards the program costs, $3,995 and the required round trip flight to Peru which ranges in the $1,000'ish range plus the Indiegogo fees. I will still be responsible for my financial obligations while I am away for the two months and account for my food and travel expenses while down there.

In February of 2014, I voluntarily separated from my employer to pursue more purposeful work where I can apply my skills, strengths and experiences to tackling societal needs that affect us all as humans. To kick start this new path in the right direction, I took a chance and paid my way to attend Ashoka U in Providence, RI a few weeks after leaving my promising corporate career path. That decision has set me on a path to designing the life I want in order to make a difference in the world around me through my social entrepreneurship. It was at this conference where I learned about the The Emzingo Group and their international fellowship programs. After learning about the great social impact, consulting work and responsible leadership development training, I knew I had to apply. So I took another chance by applying and ultimately being accepted. Now the challenges lays in how I fund this. Because it is unfunded and unpaid, I am going to have to really exhaust my savings to go, which I am willing to do because I know deep down in my core that this is a major step in the direction I want to lead my life. This fellowship is important to me because I can now take my abilities to an international stage and show the world what I can do. After many years of learning through the school of hard knocks, I am a finely tuned innovating machine. I welcome you to visit my site, www.TheEnvisioneer.com to learn more about me and what I am all about. I really do not know what to expect to come from this fellowship but I can only imagine that upon my return, I will be well on my way to establishing myself as a global entrepreneurial force for good.Your support in funding my fellowship will go towards the program costs, $3,995 and the required round trip flight to Peru which ranges in the $1,000'ish range plus the Indiegogo fees. I will still be responsible for my financial obligations while I am away for the two months and account for my food and travel expenses while down there. Any additional funds raised outside of my goal will go towards enabling me to return with a financial cushion to figure out my next steps in moving forward to doing my part in making the world a better place through business. In the event, that I fall short of my goal, I will dip into my savings to make this happen and figure out a way to get back on track when I return in August. I am in the process of applying for a nominal scholarship but that is no guarantee so I can use any help I can find. As a supporter of my fellowship, I will provide weekly updates on my activities and experiences while in Peru and commit to continuing my social impact efforts once I return in whatever capacity I can. Collectively everyone can contribute towards helping me on this journey, every little bit counts. If you visit my site, you will learn about how I have been involved in social impact projects locally and get a real sense of who I am as a person and why I need to go on this fellowship.

Center Makor has just opened his doors to local families with school age kids and their younger siblings in January, 2014. Particialy funded by CJP through Center Makor-Brighton, its Natick branch still needs lot's of support. Since January, we've started several programs for kids and they have been very successful so far: Science Club, Jewish Club, Chess Club, Fine Art, Pianno &amp; Guitar lessons, Puppet Theater and Drama, Russian Poetry, and so on. Some classes can start right away, some classes need extra support to start functioning properly. We've been asked to organize LEGO club, and we've found a teacher and we have students who wants to participate, however, we need the materials for that class. Our estimate is $2000 for the Lego Class Materials that will last for several years. </p><p>Why LEGO? </p><p>Because, it helps you to understand basic engineering principles, physics, material science, and drawing. it brings out the best of your child - his creativity, tallent, ability to imagine things - you name it. With LEGO in place, and Russian Math and Engineering principles, your child is ought to succeed!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>What we need: </p><p>So, we've got the teacher, and we've got the kids. Now what? We're a non-profit and we are trying to deliver affordable education, so we cannot charge $300 - $500 for a semester class, like others would.  We need the materials. We estimated, that we would need to spend around $2000 to aquire necessary lego pieces from local lego store in Natick Mall. Yes, we tried Craigllist already. it's not as cheap as you think either.  If we have any money left from that project, we also need an up-right piano and other supplies for the center. No dime will be spend to the overhead - everything will be dedicated to the programming of our events. </p><p>What you get: </p><p>Our biggest Thank you! If you are a parent, you'll be presented with a voucher, good for a certain amount to be spent at our center. If you are a business, you'll have an opportunity to promote yourself with Center Makor-Natick. Cetner Makor is a 503 non-profit, so all your donations are tax deductible. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>It's not a secret anymore - Russian school education creates a better impact on a student and helps student to succeed in college and get a better job after that.  Therefore, Russian Schools of Mathematics are so popular today in the United States. But not only Mathematics, that maters. When we talk about Russian education, we talk about the ways we train our kids to understand science and engineering principles. Kids with skills gained through taking a variety of Russian-originated classes learn faster and in depth, and score higher on the SAT and other tests.  We hope, bringing this center to the Metrowest community of Greater Boston, we are giving a chance to local families to provide their kids with higher level of education at affordable cost.  </p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:</p><ul>

</div></div>","My Vision 
The world has already met the exceptional Ryan
Seacrest. 
We are living our best life because of the
incomparable Oprah Winfrey. 
So, who will be the next great T.V. host of this
generation? 

                                               


Well
family and friends, I believe that it is I, Mr. Cornell Davis.

Everything that we do on this earth is a
seed being planted in the universe. We can plant seeds through our actions, and
we can plant seeds with our words.
The greatest seed that is planted in each
individual is the seed for the soul. It is this seed planted in our Soul that
will ultimately be the driving force that motivates us to live the life that we
are destined to achieve. The seeds that we should be planting in each person’s
life are motivation, inspiration, and empowerment. When those three seeds are watered and nurtured, the
tree of people’s dreams will be manifested.
                                                



Being a host and
speaking to people has been something that has been ingrained in me from a very
young age. I always knew I had a huge heart and that my greatest gift was to
plant seeds in people that would help make a difference in their lives.
Now,
in order for me to be sharp and prepare to face the fierce competition that
awaits me in this great land of L.A., I have to be properly trained. As we all
know, in order to be successful, it is important to get the right type of
training and experience, which is becoming more and more expensive.

                                              


 
Today,
I am asking all of you who have known me for any length of time, to help
me raise $2000.00 dollars for the hosting and acting training that will be
necessary throughout the next year. Every dime you give will be used to help me
master the craft of being a phenomenal host. It will also be used to support
the creation of a dynamic reel, which is an essential component   needed to showcase my talent to
agents, casting directors, and a variety of  online and traditional TV shows.
Whatever your heart leads you to
give, whether it’s $1.00 or $500.00, be assured that it will be used in every
possible way to help me strengthen, and effectively  use the seed God has put inside of me.


 Thank you in advance for your support. I love you all.

<p>We empower at-risk girls and boys through quality early education, dramatically increasing their likelihood of graduating from high school and college and living good, healthy, productive lives. </p>
<p>Did you know that early childhood education for low-income children is the most powerful job training tool?

<p>Well, I have reached the end of my fundraising campaign and have raised an amazing £1455! What a fantastic journey it has been.</p>
<p>Words are not enough to describe my gratitude towards each and every one of you, it has meant the world to me and will make a big difference to my life (and hopefully to the life of others when I qualify).  This experience has shown me the kindness and generosity that exists in others hearts, and that is a treasure in itself.</p>
<p>£1455 is nearly two months instalment fees, so I am ON THE COURSE no matter what. I also will be starting a new job late September as a brain injury case manager, and once my case load is up and running I will be in a better position to manage my fees.</p>
<p>I am making my final batch of cards, wishes, brooches and bags over the next two weeks. So sorry for delays, I always under estimate how long it takes me to make things! But rest assured they are on their way. Also, in a few weeks time I will be selling brooches on my Etsy page (I will post link later) so if you wished to purchase more, you know where to go! (cheeky plug).</p>
<p>I sincerely promise to pay forward the kindness I have received from you all. And I will keep you updated with how my course is going.</p>

<p><strong>The whys and whats of it all:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time in reading about my campaign to raise funding towards the first year of my masters in arts psychotherapy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately government funding does not exist for this part time masters (I am studying part time as need to continue working throughout), and I am unable to get a bank loan to pay my fees.... Although I am able to able save a small part of my salary towards funding this I will be not be able to raise all the funds independently. That is why I have started this fund raising campaign.</p>
<p>I understand this is a big ask, but I am trying every possible avenue to secure funding. Any amount, no matter how large or small you might be able to donate towards the funding my course would be so greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>A bit of background for you:</strong></p>
<p>There are two main reasons I feel so passionate about wishing to train as an art psychotherapist. Firstly, I have been through my own personal journey with depression and art was an integral part of my recovery. Because of this I strongly believe I can contribute to others recovery by working as an art psychotherapist.</p>
<p>Secondly, I currently work as an occupational therapist and undertake rehabilitation with individuals recovering from the devastating impact of stroke. I have observed that in traditional settings stroke patient’s psychological needs are frequently unmet, even though they are often experiencing great trauma and loss. I believe that art therapy would be a ‘way in’ with this client group to help them explore psychological difficulties they may be going through and allow emotional expression through non-verbal means. This is especially important for individuals experiencing language or cognitive impairment, which is so common after stroke. I feel very passionate about this and believe that I could make a difference to individuals recovering from stroke using art therapy as a medium.</p>
<p>It is because of these two reasons that I am desperately trying to get together funding for the first year of my masters in art psychotherapy, which I will be studying at Goldsmiths University.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about me or my art please see my blog and my flickr portfolio:</p>

<p><strong>What I Needs &amp; What You Gets:</strong></p>
<p><em>What I needs...</em></p>
<p>The cost of the masters is £4240 a year and in total £12,720 over three years (gulp).</p>
<p>In addition to fees and living costs I have to pay for personal therapy every week (a course requirement).</p>
<p><em>What you gets...</em></p>
<p>Well by contributing you get some amazing perks as you can see (!), but seriously, I wish I could give more back to you.  All I can say is that I will sincerely commit to this course and doing meaningful and healing work with people who seek art therapy.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong></p>
<p>Getting the fees for the first year of this course would make an amazing difference to my life and give me an opportunity to do something I am 100% passionate about and believe is my life mission. </p>
<p>When qualified I will commit to giving back to my local community and ensuring that art psychotherapy will be available for those on low income.</p>

Many investors therefore remain uninterested, ignoring a business opportunity that will create employment and also impact many amputees, enabling them to reintegrate back into society.We are asking for your help to get started.<br/><br/>We need to raise $90,000 (the cost of just ONE high-end prosthesis!) to build and equip a workshop here in Kenya with the equipement that will enable us to profitably make simple,functional artificial legs that will have a sale price of no more than $50.<br/>At the moment, the single biggest design and manufactering impediment is that each prosthesis must be an exact fit on the the victims amputed limb to avoid discomfort by the wearer. By using 3D scanner and 3D printer technology,we will revolutionize the manufacturing method, so that it is quicker, accurate, more effect and cheaper.The other components will be made from steel tubes, epoxy resin and polyurethane rubber, all available locally.<br/>Now we are turning to you to ask for contributions to provide the seed money to purchase this equipment, build a workshop, along with basic workshop equipment (welders, grinders, drill etc) and raw the materials to make this possible. In exchange,and in addition to our heartfelt gratitude, we will reward our supporters with an awesome range of limited edition, african-inspired jewelry and desktop ornaments created by master craftsmen from Africa.<br/><br/>We need to get this project moving quickly because of the large number of people in need.

I have created this crowdfunding website in hopes to follow a dream of mine to travel to Italy this summer, 2014. For starters, my name is Adam Crew. I am from Birmingham, AL, where I have lived for the majority of my life. I have, in the past year, been tossing around this idea in my head of escaping America and traveling to Italy for part of my summer. I have also, in the past year, realized that paying for such a trip is turning out nearly impossible. I have been working full time, but I have also been in school and paying for school so the money that I have saved has not added up. I understand that my struggle is a common one, and I am not on here looking for sympathy. This is just a last ditch effort of sorts. With summer already here and the window for my trip a month away, I am calling on people that may have chased similar dreams before, or just had a dream like this, that may can relate to my story. I am sending this out to the people I love, and potentially to people that I have never met before, asking for help to pay for my plane ticket. I have some money saved up, but it just is not enough unfortunately. The past two years of my life have been a complete whirlwind experience. They have been filled with plenty of sorrow, but a lot of joy recently as well. A range of emotions and being fed up with pondering ideas, and watching my close friends traveling around the world has led me here to this site. I have two close friends that flew to Italy yesterday, and they are staying there the whole summer. If I were able to get to Italy I would have a free place to stay with them, which is a special opportunity. To be able to explore another country with people that I love is beyond my imagination, and I know it would change my life forever. I do not expect anyone who reads this to donate money, but if you do feel like helping me, my gratitude to you will be infinite. If I do not raise enough money on my own/through this site, to get to Italy, all of the donated money will be returned. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.  </p><p>Also, since I am using this site to raise money strictly for my travel, if you have any frequent flyer miles that you may not use, those would also be greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p><p></p></div>","Hey guys! I have created this crowdfunding website in hopes to follow a dream of mine to travel to Italy this summer, 2014. For starters, my name is Adam Crew.

Think back on some of the trips your school went on or some of the places you wished you could have visited when you were young. How much more did you get out of experiencing them first hand rather than reading about them in a book?</p><p>California has continuously made budget cuts to our schools and, sadly, our school is not lucky enough to have private funding readily available.

</p><p><b>Our Campaign:</b></p>
<p>Urban Impact at Rainier Avenue Church
seeks to fund the first ever CDF Freedom Schools in Seattle and in Washington
State. Freedom Schools provides summer enrichment programming that helps Kindergartend through 5th
grade children fall in love with reading, increases their self-esteem, and
generates more positive attitudes toward learning.</p><p><b>We need your help!  We have raised $23,500 of our $30,000 budget and need your help to contribute the remaining $6,500.</b><br/></p>
<p><b>Our Background:</b></p>
<p>For more than 15 years, teachers, Urban
Impact staff, children and families have gathered together to support Summer
Day Camp at Rainier Avenue Church. This year, we’re expanding and we’re going
to need your help. We’re aligning our longstanding, 21-year old Summer Day Camp program, with the CDF Freedom schools national model curriculum. Academic
instruction will remain in the morning and fun enrichment activities will
continue in the afternoons with weekly field trips. Your support ensures a level playing field for 60 children in
Kindergarten through 5<sup>th</sup> grades. </p>
<p><b>The Challenge:</b></p>
<p>Rainier Avenue Church is located in an ethnically diverse
neighborhood, Hillman City, located in Seattle’s Rainier Valley. While rapidly
gentrifying, the neighborhood remains affected by pockets of poverty.  Low-income children are vulnerable to fall behind
academically during the summer. By 9th grade, these disparities account for two-thirds of
the achievement gap between middle/high and low income students.  Students who don’t read proficiently by third
grade and who live in poverty are four times more likely to drop out of school.
27.8% of children in Rainier Valley’s 98118 zip code live in poverty, a risk
factor for losing literacy skills over the summer.  At the two elementary schools closest to our
site, Martin Luther King Jr. and Graham Hill, an average of 58% of 3rd-5th
graders scored proficient on the state reading test (20% lower than the average
proficiency for the district). For third graders, an average of just 53% of
students at these two schools scored proficient on the state reading test (26%
lower than the Seattle district average.)</p>
<p><b>Your Impact:</b></p>
<p>This year, we are implementing CDF Freedom Schools
to address the appalling achievement gap poor and vulnerable children face.
Today, we invite you to join us to make history. By
adopting the CDF Freedom Schools curriculum, which focuses
on literacy skills and helps children develop a passion for reading, we are
leveling the playing field for the children of Rainier Valley. At the same
time, this is an opportunity for Urban Impact and Rainier Ave. Church to reach out to children in the neighborhood who might
not otherwise have educational or safe summer options. As part of this new
initiative, we are expanding on previous summers by extending camp
to 5 days per week and serving breakfast. As part of the national model, parent
and family involvement are a critical piece of a child’s education.So we’re adding a weekly
parent workshop where families can come together to dialogue with each other
and exchange best practices.  </p>
<p>CDF Freedom Schools transforms children by
changing their attitudes toward learning and instilling the truth that every
child can make a difference. This type of change will position children to be future leaders and change-agents in schools, businesses, government, schools, and neighborhoods.</p>
<p><b>Our Vision:</b></p>
<p>The Freedom Schools curriculum aligns
participatory literacy activities with Common Core standards along the weekly
themes: “I Can Make a Difference in: My Self, My Family, My Community, My
Country, and My World with Hope, Education and Action.” Each curriculum
activity is designed around a common core competency, which reinforces the
skills scholars already have, and prepares scholars for skills they will need
in the following school year. The curriculum focuses on social justice themes
from the Civil Rights era onward. The books feature characters that reflect the
multi-ethnic diversity of the Rainier Valley. These culturally rich stories
help scholars relate to books as they process their own experiences, cultural
heritage, and history through the eyes of children.</p><p>$6,500 for 60 child scholars this summer in Seattle, this money will help fund:</p><p> - $25 can provide 3 books for one child in Freedom Schools<br/> - $50 can power a summer field trip experience for one child<br/> - $100 can provide one child with dance, swimming and enrichment classes<br/> - $150 could mean optimal learning with a 1:10 scholar to teacher ratio<br/>- $350 could fund the remaining expense gap of 6 weeks of tuition for one child</p>

</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>""smART play"" will be an after school enrichment center in Encinitas, CA designed to provide a safe environment for kids that will allow them to freely express themselves. It will be franchised and spread across the whole United States. It will offer creative classes for children grades 1-12 in improvisation, film, music, art, creative writing, and dance. Public Schools cannot provide this for children, but I can. I have the background, the skill, the passion, the knowledge, the understanding of how greatly art positively affects children growing up, and most importantly; the support and qualified staff that will help make ""smART play"" successful. Kids still deserve this opportunity, and it is my mission to provide it for them.</p>
<p>If you are aware of this rising epidemic of childhood 
depression, anxiety, and ADHD diagnosis, then you will understand WHY 
this is mandatory. I have done the research on how the arts can and WILL
 reduce these numbers, and it is indisputable. The links to the 
scientific research are all provided on the bottom of this campaign.<br/></p>
<p>Original campaign video (has a few more details about ""smART play""): <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbvq15A8VGY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gbvq15A8VGY</a></p>
<h3>Arts and Learning

</p>
<p>""When you are doing art, your brain is working on all 8
cylinders at full speed which cause
profound and seemingly permanent changes in the brain. A child's ability to keep a rhythm is correlated with
the ability to read. Brain
areas are developed as the child learns songs and rhymes, and creates drawings
and finger paintings. The dancing and movements during play develop motor
skills, and the sum of these activities enhances emotional well-being. And
sharing their artwork enhances social skills."" <span><br/></span><span></span></p>
<h3>Arts and Healing<br/>
</h3>
<p><span>
<span>""Scientific studies tell us that art heals by changing
a person's physiology and attitude. Art and music put a person in a different brain wave pattern.</span></span> Art and music affect every cell in the body instantly to create a healing
physiology that changes the immune system and blood flow to all the organs. Art
and Music change attitude, emotional state, and pain perception. They create hope and
positivity and they help people cope with difficulties. <span><span>In fact it is now known by neurophysiologists that art, prayer, and healing all
come from the same source in the body."" </span></span></p>
<br/><h3>My Background and Mission<br/>
</h3>
<p>I am Giovanna Maimone, and I have always loved art. All kinds. It was a way for me to work through my pains as a child and make it all better, but now I understand what it has also done for my intellect. I wrote poetry, created visual art, and studied acting at a young age. I then went to a Performing Arts High School for Drama in New Jersey where I grew up, and then on to The University of Southern California's School of Theater in Los Angeles. It was there I started tutoring Math and working with children. <br/></p>
<p>I still work with kids tutoring Math and English, and have my own production company J.C.M. Productions, Inc. <a href=""http://www.jcmproductions.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.jcmproductions.us</a>. I also play guitar, percussion, paint, draw, dance, and write songs, movies, films, and stories. I could not imagine my life without art. It has also made me able to learn more, care more, to be a better listener, more compassionate, expressive, ambitious, and confident....all the things important in human development. I know that it was art, as all the studies have proven, that contributed to my accomplishments and my spiritual well being. Kids now, unfortunately do not have those outlets made available to them and the diagnosis of childhood depression, anxiety, and ADHD is rising! <br/></p>
<p>Art was introduced to me very early on in school. We had art class, music class, dance class, creative writing class, and school plays. Where are the arts in schools now? Where are our children supposed to get exposed to the arts so it will improve their quality of learning and living?  And reduce these childhood conditions? That's where I come in. I am ready to combine my business knowledge, my lifelong training and participation in the arts, and my love for; working with and helping kids learn and be more confident by tapping into their creativity, and becoming smART kidz!<br/></p>
<h3>What Funds are Needed and What Your Contribution Means<br/>
</h3>
<p>I need a total of about $100,000 just to open my first location.  The $20,000 cash I raise from this campaign will got towards rent, insurance, instructors payroll and immediate cash expenses. I will be renting an open warehouse space of about 3000sq feet. Renovations, which require permits, are needed to build a sound proof room for the movie making/editing, and music classes. There will be a section for day care so that babies and toddlers will have exposure to the arts while they play all day. The main room will have art tables and non toxic recycled art supplies and a dance area with a removable stage area for improvisation. The room will be safe, padded, non toxic and energy efficient and your contributions will help me provide the safest environment for these children.<br/></p>
<p>I truly believe in my heart that art can help heal, and science has proven that art creates a stronger working machine (brain) for our kids. Children are being diagnosed with depression and disorders left and right and I don't think it's a coincidence that the numbers have increased, soon after art got eliminated out of the public school systems. Your contribution along with my mission will help these kids, and give them what they deserve to have; a better quality of life.  If you ever ""wished that there was something you could do""... by helping 
me open ""smART play"", you will not only be helping children in San Diego, 
you will endlessly  be helping children across our nation! This first 
location is the start of ""smART play"" Franchises all across the United States! I promise, this is just the beginning.<br/></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Cat Widdifield needs funds to train for Aerospace's Focus Mitt competition.  A yearly event which benefits a charity.  But this is not for glory alone, it's about giving back to community while having fun!  50% of donations will go to training and 50% will go to The East Harlem School!</p>
<h3>Cat</h3>
<p>An NYC based actress, dancer and performance artist, Cat has been an athlete since a young child and has maintained her priority for fitness the past year and a half at Aerospace Gym.</p>
<h3>Aerospace</h3>
<p>A gym without machines and few weights, it is a different kind of a workout, based on boxing and ballet training techniques.  And a lot of sweat!  Aerospace is not only a positively charged environment full of support and commraderie, but also a believer in giving back.  Which is where their yearly ""CTBS"" (Cut The Bull Sh*t) qualifying competition and the final Fight 4 Fitness event later in the year come in.</p>
<h3>The Charity</h3>
<p>Last year the East Harlem School was the beneficiary of the funds raised from the Fight 4 Fitness event.  An amazing school in Harlem for low-income middle school kids where they have an extended school day, year round school year, organic vegetarian lunches (!) and small class sizes.  This year's charity is sure to be just as awesome!</p>
<p>Not only a believer in fitness, Cat is deeply inspired to give back.  As an artist, such goals are sometimes lofty, but with this event she hopes she can contribute on a larger scale.</p>
<h3>The Qualifier: CTBS</h3>
<p>CTBS is the first round of competition to qualify for the main event- Fight 4 Fitness, held later in the year.</p>
<p>The date of CTBS is yet to be announced, but will be either the end of June or beginning of July.</p>
<p>After incidentals (Indiegogo and paypal take a cut), half of the contributions will go directly to The East Harlem School.  The other half will go toward training expenses including classes and private training sessions with Teddy Singleton (shown in the video above), Michael Olajide Jr. and Leila Fazel.</p>
<p>With these sessions costing $50-200 each... $1,100 will make enough sessions possible so Cat can learn the combination and get fast enough to really wail on those mitts!!</p>
<h3>The Main Event: Fight 4 Fitness</h3>
<p>CTBS will be open to members only, but if Cat wins her round, she'll qualify for Fight 4 Fitness, held later in the year... Which will be an affair not to be missed!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a single mother of a 7yr old little boy. I have been working on a Psychology degree off and on since 1998 and am only 24hrs from graduating. I am a waitress because it is the most flexible job that allows me to pay my bills but I only scrape by. I need a new/used vehicle because I have had problems with it every summer for the last 4yrs and this year it finally blew the motor.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $30,000 to help support me threw the school year, pay tuition, and to buy a reliable vehicle to transport my son and I back and forth to school and work. I don't have anything to offer other than prayer and thanks. Even if I don't reach my goal, every little bit will help!! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I finally graduate I want to help children and be a light to those in need. I have a huge heart and want to help everyone because I am a giver and a healer. I'm most passionate about children and look forward to being an advocate for those in need who have lived difficult lives because I was abused as a child myself and went threw foster home after foster home. I know what it's like to be taken from your parents and thrown into the system. With your contribution, you can help me help them!!</p>

 'Dit boek
raakt mij, het is praktisch en geeft een handvat om het leven vorm te geven
door dicht bij jezelf te blijven. Een aanrader voor ieder die wat van zijn
leven wil maken en nu tegen blokkades oploopt.Joke de
Meris'


'Dit boek
voegt nieuwe inzichten toe aan de vele zelfhulpboeken die er al zijn. Integraal
totaalplaatje en goed gestructureerd, goed te begrijpen en toepasbaar hoe je je
leven meer in de hand kunt krijgen en houden.Hans
Veldwiesch'


'Het boek
leest makkelijk door de korte zinnen en de schrijfstijl. Door de persoonlijke
verhalen raak ik geïnteresseerd. Het meest positieve is dat ik door informatie
uit het boekje mezelf kan helpen en met mezelf aan de slag kan gaan. Hennie van Driel-Giede

Een uitstekend professioneel onderbouwd boek,
lekker leesbaar met een aantal persoonlijke passages, dat een goed inzicht
geeft wat angst en stress betreftEdith Koppenol'

'Dit boek geeft je inzichten die je  verder kunnen helpen. Is het niet de gehele oplossing van je probleem dan geeft het je weer richting en is het een bijdrage aan de oplossing. Want ergens is de oplossing voorhanden alleen jij zult het moeten vinden. Dit boek geeft je een positief inzicht in je zoektocht naar de oplossing.Het bevat veel elementen die je kunnen helpen. Succes met het lezen en het vinden van jouw antwoorden.Sietse Butterhof'


'Wat me aanspreekt dat je met weinig middelen, zoals pen-potlood en jezelf aan de slag kunt. De theorie en vervolgens praktische oefeningen zijn duidelijk en verhelderend. De voorbeelden een goede aanvulling op de uitleg. Dit boek straalt eerlijkheid, haalbaarheid, leesbaarheid en warmte uit. Hélène Otten'

Mijn naam is René Arns (1954) en ik help graag mensen van hun angsten af. Ik doe dat al een kleine tien jaar in mijn praktijk in den Haag. Ik heb in die periode een manier gevonden waarmee dat effectief en snel kan. 
Met een boek kan ik veel meer mensen bereiken. Ik kan ze ook helpen als het een zelf hulp boek is. Dat is de reden dat ik 'C.L.A.I.M een leven zonder angst' heb geschreven. Een boek waarin alles wat ik weet  te vinden is en waarmee je zelf aan de slag kan. 
Daarnaast gaat 10% van de opbrengst van deze campagne naar Project Light Rwanda, een prachtig project waarbij Post traumatisch Stress Syndroom wordt opgelost bij de overlevers van de genocide in Rwanda. Een hele generatie leeft daar in trauma en angst. Daar is met dit project nu een oplossing voor. Zo helpen we mee om angst op nog grotere schaal de wereld uit te helpen.
Ik heb al de nodige levens van mensen zien veranderen, het kan. Je vindt de verhalen van een aantal van die mensen ook in dit boek terug. De feedback van de proeflezers was zeer positief en inspirerend. Er is behoefte aan dit boek, dat is mij wel heel duidelijk geworden. Een aantal mensen kijkt er al naar uit en vraagt ernaar. 
Ik ben ook heel blij met het voorwoord dat 'Iceman' Wim Hof heeft geschreven, een man die op onnavolgbare wijze zijn angsten heeft overwonnen en dat breed uitdraagt en demonstreert.
Wat heb ik nodig? Het manuscript is nu helemaal klaar voor de drukker. Redactie en vormgeving zijn rond. Nu alleen nog drukken, promoten en uitgeven. Ik heb er al heel veel tijd en geld in geïnvesteerd en heb nu alleen nog funding nodig voor die laatste stappen. Totaal komt dat neer op € 5000 euro. 
Ik bedacht me dat als 100 mensen bereid zijn om € 50 te investeren we er al zijn. Dat moet toch kunnen? Ik heb al zoveel enthousiaste reacties mogen ontvangen van zeer nieuwsgierige mensen, dat die 100 zeker te vinden moeten zijn. Daarom heb ik besloten deze campagne te beginnen.
Ik bied jou als tegenprestatie (zgn. perks, engels voor voordeel; zie hier rechts naast) een reeks van dingen aan. Je krijgt dus waar voor je geld. In die zin is het niet een gift, maar je mag uiteraard ook een bedrag als gift storten. Dat kom je tegen als je je 'perk' kiest. Bekijk ze en kies welke jou het meeste aanspreekt. 

Het varieert van een CLAIM boekenlegger tot het e-boek, het boek, het boek met boeklegger en uitnodiging voor de boekpresentatie of een begeleiding van 6 of 12 weken voor jou persoonlijk waarbij we het CLAIM taject gaan doorlopen met het verwezenlijken van jouw doel als resultaat. Ook kun jebij een aantal perks  als sponsor worden genoemd op de website en in het boek (2e druk).

Je kunt me ook enorm helpen door deze campagne breed te delen in je netwerk. Wil je dat doen? Gaat heel makkeijk via de knoppen  links.

                                                               ""Coding is an important and popular skill in education. The book A Day in Code by Shari Eskenas is a super fun way to help kids understand the connections of coding (and logical thinking) to everyday life!""-Chris Woods, teacher, podcaster, & creator of Daily STEM ""Think in code"" as you read about real life situations described logically in terms of code.  You'll learn fundamental programming concepts and the C language.  Each code page starts with a high level description of the situation in English. In the middle, there is code that represents the situation. After the code, there is a description of what the code does.                          Each code page contains a full and complete C program that introduces a different C programming concept. No prior programming experience is required.  Each program in the book can be compiled with a C compiler and run on your computer! There are many free C compilers available online.  Each program in the book contains a printf() function that prints text to your screen. You can play around with the code and change numbers if you want (like ordering 15 pizzas instead of 5).The full page illustration next to the code page shows the situation represented by the code.                                               What is the target age for this book? All ages, step right up! Very young children can enjoy the book as a fun picture book and have the added benefit of being exposed to logical thinking and code. Older kids and adults can gain a more in-depth understanding of the programming concepts and C language by reading the book (and enjoying the pictures!).                                                         At the beginning of the book (before the story begins), there will be a few pages set aside for defining basic programming concepts and syntax.                                                             C is a widely used foundational language and is known as the ""mother of all programming languages"" because so many languages (such as C++ and Java) are derived from it.  C's logical concepts and syntax are applicable to other languages.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is SigEp Christmas?</h3>
<p>For almost twenty years the men of Sigma Phi Epsilon-IN Zeta have been active in assisting the Hilltop Neighborhood House of Valparaiso, Indiana, which provides families in need with an educational and cost-friendly daycare service. SigEp Christmas helps Hilltop House through updating the toys and necessities of both the daycare center and the families.</p>
<p>This year, we hope to continue this tradition of giving. We are raising money in order to by new toys and equipment for the Hilltop facility to provide the most enjoyable and rewarding experience for the children. The toys will be presented at the annual SigEp Christmas Event on December 4.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">""A place to learn, a place to grow, a place to belong.""</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1027009/files/20141118140517-HilltopWord_jpeg_1_.jpg?1416348317"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Established in 1995, Hilltop Neighborhood House opened its doors to children throughout the community with a single focus: to provide individualized, quality care and education to nourish the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical skills that children will carry with them on their journey through life. Hilltop enrolls around 75 children ranging from the ages of six weeks old to five years old. Over sixty-five percent of children at Hilltop are from low-income households. Their childcare education is individualized care for each child, preparing each one for kindergarten readiness.  79% of the families at Hilltop are under scholarship. ""Hilltop Too: Walt's Place"" after school program allows students to come to Walt's Place directly after school to participate in various projects and activities allowing their parents to keep working or go to school. Students are provided with a snack, tutoring help, and social time consisting of activities such as fooseball or crafts. Hilltop even provides adult education classes, whether it be adults preparing for the TASC (previously GED) or just wanting to brush up on basic subjects for college . Hilltop also assists the community through the ""Village Food Pantry"" which is a great opportunity to fill the stomachs of less fortunate families.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h2>
<p>Gifting everyday needs and wants enables Hilltop House to allocate more funds towards student scholarship and educational programs mentioned above. Whether it be a toy brightening a child's holiday season or a playhouse lasting for years, every contribution to SigEp Christmas benefits a child's education. There is no doubt that Hilltop House is a great cause which allows for children to get a fair chance at education, but their excellent opportunities would not exist without generosity and support. The gentlemen of Sigma Phi Epsilon pride ourselves on giving back to the community. That being said, SigEp Christmas cannot exist without the support of giving families looking to make a difference. Through your generosity you will be putting a smile on a child's face this holiday season.</p>

<p></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Going Above &amp; Beyond</b></h2>We do not want to stop at just contributing to the Hilltop organization! We want to make it our priority to give the kids and their families a great holiday season too.<p></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Meeting our goal of $4,000 will allow us to... </b></h2>
<p><b>1.) Provide the Hilltop with the toys and necessities they are asking for to ensure another year of great childhood programs!</b></p>
<p><b>2.) Buy each individual child at least one toy that they will get to keep and take home!</b></p>
<p><b>3.) Give each family a grocery store gift card that will help them financially through this holiday season!</b></p>

For almost twenty years the men of Sigma Phi Epsilon-IN Zeta have been active in assisting the Hilltop Neighborhood House of Valparaiso, Indiana, which provides families in need with an educational and cost-friendly daycare service. SigEp Christmas helps Hilltop House through updating the toys and necessities of both the daycare center and the families.
This year, we hope to continue this tradition of giving. We are raising money in order to by new toys and equipment for the Hilltop facility to provide the most enjoyable and rewarding experience for the children. The toys will be presented at the annual SigEp Christmas Event on December 4.

""A place to learn, a place to grow, a place to belong.""

Established in 1995, Hilltop Neighborhood House opened its doors to children throughout the community with a single focus: to provide individualized, quality care and education to nourish the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical skills that children will carry with them on their journey through life. Hilltop enrolls around 75 children ranging from the ages of six weeks old to five years old. Over sixty-five percent of children at Hilltop are from low-income households. Their childcare education is individualized care for each child, preparing each one for kindergarten readiness.  79% of the families at Hilltop are under scholarship. ""Hilltop Too: Walt's Place"" after school program allows students to come to Walt's Place directly after school to participate in various projects and activities allowing their parents to keep working or go to school. Students are provided with a snack, tutoring help, and social time consisting of activities such as fooseball or crafts. Hilltop even provides adult education classes, whether it be adults preparing for the TASC (previously GED) or just wanting to brush up on basic subjects for college . Hilltop also assists the community through the ""Village Food Pantry"" which is a great opportunity to fill the stomachs of less fortunate families.
   See more info at: Hilltop House Website



The Impact
Gifting everyday needs and wants enables Hilltop House to allocate more funds towards student scholarship and educational programs mentioned above. Whether it be a toy brightening a child's holiday season or a playhouse lasting for years, every contribution to SigEp Christmas benefits a child's education. There is no doubt that Hilltop House is a great cause which allows for children to get a fair chance at education, but their excellent opportunities would not exist without generosity and support. The gentlemen of Sigma Phi Epsilon pride ourselves on giving back to the community. That being said, SigEp Christmas cannot exist without the support of giving families looking to make a difference. Through your generosity you will be putting a smile on a child's face this holiday season.




Going Above & BeyondWe do not want to stop at just contributing to the Hilltop organization! We want to make it our priority to give the kids and their families a great holiday season too.
Meeting our goal of $4,000 will allow us to... 
1.) Provide the Hilltop with the toys and necessities they are asking for to ensure another year of great childhood programs!
2.) Buy each individual child at least one toy that they will get to keep and take home!
3.) Give each family a grocery store gift card that will help them financially through this holiday season!

Due to my lack of experienced, coupled with my much to trusting good nature, this became the ultimate  undoing for me.  Others stole many of my great inventions. Much of what I have done in bygone years has been misappropriated by shameless others.  </span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A very clear cut example of one bad experience stands out greater than many others. It was a giant hurt when it happened, because I believe that it was one of my great inventions among other accomplishments at the time, it was stolen away from me. My <b>{Automatic Self Flushing Toilet}</b>, which by the way happened to be the worlds first intelligent self flushing toilet control system.  The earliest crude version of my device, held my provisional patent # 06/650,075 at the United States Patent and Trademarks Office.  I initially called it the Automated Commode Fixture.  I was inspired to design and build my first one after a friend came to visit my home work shop.  He left my bathroom light on all night, my sink water running, and my toilet not flushed.  I did not realize how deplorable my friend had left my bathroom at the time because I had labored all night repairing Television sets among other equipment.  I did not find out about all that until early the next morning when I had to relieve myself.  My friend left without having so much as said goodbye without my knowing that.  I had told him late during the night that if felt sleepy,  that he could make himself at home in my bedroom, and that I would be working most of the night on my test bench.  When I discovered how my friend had left my bathroom the idea hit me at once.  I thought out how to solve that problem for myself, so I would never have to find the calling card so to speak of anybodies waste products in my toilet ever again.  I set out to draw up a schematic of my circuits, and I devised a working prototype of the worlds first intelligent automatic self flushing toilet.  It worked flawlessly.  When i walk into my restroom, the ceiling light comes on, and music played from my 8 Track Tape Player. When I encountered the toilet zone, that armed my auto flushing control logic circuits, when I departed the restroom area, that initiated the sequence of flushing my toilet, deactivating my ceiling lamp, and a timer activated both my window exhaust fan as well as my air ionizer to purge foul fumes from my restroom area.  When my friend came to visit my home again he told me that he saw all the things I had hooked up to my toilet.  He told me that he thought that I was trying to electrocute him.  I replied the following; ""That's not a half ass bad thought I told Bo Bo, considering how badly you left my bathroom before"".  My friend then told me this; ""Howard, I walked into your restroom, then the lights came on all by themselves, I  walked up to that thing and saw all that stuff hooked up to your toilet, so I walked away from it and the toilet flushed all by its self"".  He proceeded to repeat then the following over and over again: ""you've got yourself a million dollars"",  I thought about what he had said, and figured that if I solved my problem with my restroom, then perhaps I have solved the same problem for others. I sought out the only patent attorney we had in our small town.  I paid way too much for his services over $6,500.00 to get the patent protection  I needed, but I had obtained my provisional patent and had gained the Foreign rights. Unfortunately  I got the bad news from the patents office that they considered my invention to be obvious so it was latter abandoned by the patent office for reasons too lengthy and ugly to go into right now.  </span></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/1cP-Qa8JfjQd </a><br/></span></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The rest is an even longer story, so I will dispense with complicated sorted details at this time, regarding to much bad to explain easily.  Lets it suffice to say for now that</span></span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> my attorney and his cohorts in crime, cheated me out of everything I rightfully had coming to me pertaining to my inventions.

I want to live my life by the example that Jesus left us all to follow.  Jesus did not dislike or wish bad things to happen to those who wronged him unjustly, because he loves everyone despite any bad they may do.  He even forgave  those who persecuted and caused him to endure unthinkable pain torture and suffering before and on the</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> cross for our sake.  In  comparison to what Jesus had experienced, I have  gone through nothing at all.  I do not have the right to judge anyone for any reason.  Nothing that I can ever experienced bad in this life gives me any right to despise those that God loves. I can hold no resentment in my heart towards anyone.  I resent what others have done to me, but I hold no malice in my heart for those who have wronged me at all.  I want to make it know that  I have love in my heart for everyone. I  completely forgive all who have ever wronged me in any way, and will try very to the best of my ability with every fiber in my being  to forget all of the bad things that I remember.  I want only the very best to happen for all and will continue to pray for the salvation of everyone for as long as I live.  </span></span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My request of you, is that you help me with what I am wanting to accomplish with this invention, which is to bring the world something that is truly needed and beneficial to all.  I  believe the Rollins Freezer-VAC is my greatest invention.  I know it was a gift from God.  I want to make it wonders accessible to all the people of world, but I can not do so alone.  Help me to implement what God wants to happen, I believe that God wants to end the wasting foods and other items.  With the aid  your donations we can help to  providing one of</span></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> God's gifts to our world.  The good you do will come back to you.

No more wasting foods , which will  Save You Money!  The Rollins Freezer-VAC is an Excitingly New Technical Innovation, that will change the way we think about Refrigeration Forever!The Depressurizing Freezer Unit                                                                                   U. S. Patent Pending # 62/233,487My Invention is a technical innovation that can be used as an upgrade for traditional refrigerators. It can also be utilized as stand alone long term foods & perishable items refrigerated storage device. Normally food and other items go bad in the typical refrigerator, because air inside the refrigerator still provides decomposing agents to disintegrate what is in the freezer over time. Air is a necessary component to sustain all living organisms.How it WorksThis device extracts the air from the freezer compartment chamber, since all active decomposing agents require various gasses from air to cause their chemical and biological molecular decomposition process to take place, by removing air these agents can not continue to live. The agents are various viruses, bacteria, mildew, fungi, slime etc,.  Air normally sustains them as it's does the majority of living organisms on earth.  These are the parasites that cause biological organisms to rote, smell bad and eventually decompose, the parasites are what cause foods to eventually spoil and chemical substances to lose their structured  integrity.  Realizing how mater is decomposed, I decided to deprive the agents of air by, taking all the air out of my refrigerator then by electronic means eradicate bad agents by bombarding them with Ultraviolet Irradiation signals modulated at X-ray frequency to penetrate deeply within foods and substances, in so having done this, the foods and other chemical substances within my refrigerator do not go bad.  Even the bad food disintegrating  agents previously mentioned above  that normally can withstand the cryogenic cold internal environment of a typical refrigerator, are no match for the hostile airless low pressure environment of the Rollins-Freezer-VAC.  I knew from the start that I was on to something, that could change the world for the better with my idea.  If provided with enough funding to to continue my work I will be able to take my invention to the next level. I know that my invention can become an affordable product, that will prevent food from going bad in a refrigerator for a prolonged or even an indefinite period of time once totally refined. I still need to undergo an exhaustive thorough testing and product development phase with my product.  This will conclusively establish more fully the capabilities once a full scale analysis of my invention is fully tested and develop.  My objective is to develop a product with the aid of enough financial assistance, to make the Rollins Freezer-VAC  become one of the most amazing refrigerators the world has ever known.  Wont you be so kind as to assist me though the aid of your greatly needed and highly appreciated donations large or small, to make it possible to bring the Rollins Freezer-VAC to the homes of everyone around the world. Anyone who has ever experienced the life threatening dangers to their health associated with having eaten food after it's  gone rancid in refrigerators, can appreciate  the value of my invention.  Together we can end this problem once and for all. Allow me to share something with you for a moment.  Many years ago I was an inventor,  who was badly taken advantage of during the days of my youth. Due to my lack of experienced, coupled with my much to trusting good nature, this became the ultimate  undoing for me.  Others stole many of my great inventions. Much of what I have done in bygone years has been misappropriated by shameless others.  A very clear cut example of one bad experience stands out greater than many others. It was a giant hurt when it happened, because I believe that it was one of my great inventions among other accomplishments at the time, it was stolen away from me. My {Automatic Self Flushing Toilet}, which by the way happened to be the worlds first intelligent self flushing toilet control system.  The earliest crude version of my device, held my provisional patent # 06/650,075 at the United States Patent and Trademarks Office.  I initially called it the Automated Commode Fixture.  I was inspired to design and build my first one after a friend came to visit my home work shop.  He left my bathroom light on all night, my sink water running, and my toilet not flushed.  I did not realize how deplorable my friend had left my bathroom at the time because I had labored all night repairing Television sets among other equipment.  I did not find out about all that until early the next morning when I had to relieve myself.  My friend left without having so much as said goodbye without my knowing that.  I had told him late during the night that if felt sleepy,  that he could make himself at home in my bedroom, and that I would be working most of the night on my test bench.  When I discovered how my friend had left my bathroom the idea hit me at once.  I thought out how to solve that problem for myself, so I would never have to find the calling card so to speak of anybodies waste products in my toilet ever again.  I set out to draw up a schematic of my circuits, and I devised a working prototype of the worlds first intelligent automatic self flushing toilet.  It worked flawlessly.  When i walk into my restroom, the ceiling light comes on, and music played from my 8 Track Tape Player. When I encountered the toilet zone, that armed my auto flushing control logic circuits, when I departed the restroom area, that initiated the sequence of flushing my toilet, deactivating my ceiling lamp, and a timer activated both my window exhaust fan as well as my air ionizer to purge foul fumes from my restroom area.  When my friend came to visit my home again he told me that he saw all the things I had hooked up to my toilet.  He told me that he thought that I was trying to electrocute him.  I replied the following; ""That's not a half ass bad thought I told Bo Bo, considering how badly you left my bathroom before"".  My friend then told me this; ""Howard, I walked into your restroom, then the lights came on all by themselves, I  walked up to that thing and saw all that stuff hooked up to your toilet, so I walked away from it and the toilet flushed all by its self"".  He proceeded to repeat then the following over and over again: ""you've got yourself a million dollars"",  I thought about what he had said, and figured that if I solved my problem with my restroom, then perhaps I have solved the same problem for others. I sought out the only patent attorney we had in our small town.  I paid way too much for his services over $6,500.00 to get the patent protection  I needed, but I had obtained my provisional patent and had gained the Foreign rights. Unfortunately  I got the bad news from the patents office that they considered my invention to be obvious so it was latter abandoned by the patent office for reasons too lengthy and ugly to go into right now.  https://youtu.be/1cP-Qa8JfjQd The rest is an even longer story, so I will dispense with complicated sorted details at this time, regarding to much bad to explain easily.  Lets it suffice to say for now that my attorney and his cohorts in crime, cheated me out of everything I rightfully had coming to me pertaining to my inventions. They did what was necessary for them to keep me from making any money on my inventions at all.  I was of course very discouraged and embittered.  I have spent most of my life trying to make useful things that could in some way improve our world in some way.  I have never given up on the hope that one day I will succeed enjoy a few  of the finer things that life has to offer.  I never thought for a moment  that it is wrong to desire a good life for myself, while helping others to achieve the same.  A few of the good things for the longest time have seemed unreachable until now. I just want to continue my work to develop my inventions for the betterment of all of mankind. Living a good life was in stark contrast to the reality I was facing at the time.  In spite of  all the bad experiences, I still want to help others to achieve enjoyment of life, and to live ever healthier, and safer.  This is why I continue to work at my objectives, of developing products for the benefit of all everyone.  God loves everyone, who am I that I should not do the same. I want to live my life by the example that Jesus left us all to follow.  Jesus did not dislike or wish bad things to happen to those who wronged him unjustly, because he loves everyone despite any bad they may do.  He even forgave  those who persecuted and caused him to endure unthinkable pain torture and suffering before and on the cross for our sake.  In  comparison to what Jesus had experienced, I have  gone through nothing at all.  I do not have the right to judge anyone for any reason.  Nothing that I can ever experienced bad in this life gives me any right to despise those that God loves. I can hold no resentment in my heart towards anyone.  I resent what others have done to me, but I hold no malice in my heart for those who have wronged me at all.  I want to make it know that  I have love in my heart for everyone. I  completely forgive all who have ever wronged me in any way, and will try very to the best of my ability with every fiber in my being  to forget all of the bad things that I remember.  I want only the very best to happen for all and will continue to pray for the salvation of everyone for as long as I live.  My request of you, is that you help me with what I am wanting to accomplish with this invention, which is to bring the world something that is truly needed and beneficial to all.  I  believe the Rollins Freezer-VAC is my greatest invention.  I know it was a gift from God.  I want to make it wonders accessible to all the people of world, but I can not do so alone.  Help me to implement what God wants to happen, I believe that God wants to end the wasting foods and other items.  With the aid  your donations we can help to  providing one of God's gifts to our world.  The good you do will come back to you. That is my promise to you.  I believe this deeply within my heart. This is not guess, it is a fact.  the reason why I am so certainly sure is because  I know that God always keeps his promises.  God inspires those who believe in him to be truly creative.  Non believes by and large, are not large in number among the ranks of the great inventors of history.  Only the greatest ideas and inventions come from the minds of those who truly believe in God. The day I came up with the Rollins Freezer-VAC, when it was just an idea, God spoke these words to me in a dream soon after I conceived the idea for this invention. I will quote them to you:  ""One day soon, you will bring what I have inspired you to produce to the needy of the world to make it a better thing for all, that day is drawing near"".  What God has inspired me to do, is to bring forth this product  which I believe, could only be described as a blessed miracle from his mercy.  The benefits of such a product should be crystal clearly obvious to the minds of everyone who possesses  good reasoning.  I have a true love for God and a love for all our fellow brothers and sisters who encompass all of humanity.The prospect of making our world a better place for all gives me great hope and pleasure.  The promise that this will  be soon from God, lets me know it will surely come to happen.  God holds the promise that it will be.  Personally I know for a fact that this will come to be, because I have faith in the fact that God always keep his word of what he promises to us. This is because he loves everyone.   Currently working to the best of my ability towards obtaining licensing  arrangements with product manufactures pertaining to the following invention:The Depressuring Freezer Unit.  United States Patent  Pending status: Active # 62/233,487 also referred to as The Rollins Freezer-VAC or The Rollins Freeze-VAC. Active date of registration: September 28, 2015Foreign Rights as required granted effective as of: October 13, 2015 A recap of facts I have stated earlier:This Invention The Rollins Freeze-Vac is designed to convert the Traditional Refrigerator, into the Safest, Healthiest  possible Long Term Storage and Preserving Device.  Capable of rendering bacteria, virus, fungi, slime, and mole harmless within the confines of the freezer compartment. This will by far the Safest, and Healthiest Method of food and chemical substance preservation yet ever devised. Traditional refrigerators were never designed to keep foods freshInfinitely. The Rollins Freezer-VAC does not allow foods to spoil, decompose or go bad at all. Food can last virtually Indefinitely with the aid of this new technology.. They are just short term food storage devices,  Food kept in them goes bad in a short amount of time.  The Rollins Freezer-VAC is the worlds first Long Term Refrigerator,  This device does not permit food to go bad at all.  Food kept in the Freezer-VAC never ruins, stays fresh as the day it was first preserved until you are ready to consume it.  No more wasted products to be thrown in the trash again.This device makes possible food storage for far longer than has ever been possible before since it does not allow food products and other perishables to spoil or decompose.  By completely extracting air from a refrigerator, The Rollins Freezer-VAC provides for virtual unlimited preservation storage time. This invention is designed to eliminate the key agents that cause perishables to go rancid, deteriorate and become toxic and harmful.  With air totally removed from the freezer chamber the bad agents that spoil food are rendered harmless.  Carbon Dioxide or C02'S, that work as an air acid biodegradable in like manner to the affects of the corrosive and erosive affects of Oxygen on chemical and biological structure. All of the adverse effects of these and other gases are removed from the equation that causes deterioration in biological and chemical substances by The Rollins Freezer-VAC.  Adversarial components of Air are relegated to the role of an inactive state, rendering them  non effective on the contents of the cold chamber confinement compartment of the Rollins Freezer-VAC. Without the natural elements that break down products, said products have an indefinite long term viability. In Essence, foods and other perishable items remain in their initial pristine fresh condition, with little to no degradation or loss of potency consistency. High quality prolonged over a virtual indefinite period of time. The Rollins Freezer-VAC produces a hostile environment to the harmful destructive agents that deteriorate the chemical composition of foods and other substances. This invention is high energy efficient as well due to a built in air evacuated wall isolated barrier region that is also insulated to prevent convection currents carring warm air from infiltrating the refrigerated internal cabinet area. This  feature that resists the outside ambient air from warming up the internal freezer chamber compartment, makes this invention less reliant on its temperature cool down compressor.  Refrigerators equipped with this invention, will save consumers an inestimable amount of money since foods will be purchased in bulk quantities with need of no fear that they will ever go bad before they are to be consumed.  This is also true of course,  of other products placed within it.  Said products will retain their full content value with little to no change over time as well.This device is the latest major innovative step in the art of refrigeration evolution. I know that it will dramatically improve the technological advancement of refrigeration.  My technique involves more than just the mere extraction of air, I have combined several methods which condition the items placed within the Freezer-VAC that collectively, insure that the process of cellular disruption at a molecular level insures that the agents that devalue the potency of substances are rendered ineffective. My Invention, will have an equivalent effective impact so dramatic a change by comparison as that of our having starting out with Early Vacuum Tube Black & White Television's & concluding with the present day Solid State of the Art Digital Flat Screened High Color Definition Modern Marvels of Today.
