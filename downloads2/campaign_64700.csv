<h2><strong>Handle</strong></h2>
</div><p>We are especially proud of the handles… because they feel exceptional in the hand. </p><p>Also, the knife makers from ""KnivesMasters"" designed the black, red and golden materials based on the colors of the German flag. The exception is the Station Chef Knife with its Japanese colors.</p><p>The handle is made of stabilized poplar wood. It is really handy and can be gripped comfortably, even with large hands.</p><p>It's shape flows from rounded oval near the blade to a supportive square or oval profile at the back. This gives the optimum combination of comfort, support, and precision.</p><p>The handle is also specially sealed and almost completely resistant to moisture, requiring only minimal care. It should not be left to sit in dishwater.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511457268/j0i1uwmf6dvsaygkcio0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2><strong>Magic Handle</strong></h2><p>Want your knife to be EVEN MORE exclusive?</p><p>You can opt for the KNIVESMASTERS special Magic Handle, which incorporates very fine aluminum-strontium pigmentation into the material.</p><p>This develops a strong reflective glow with exposure to light.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511459521/js3ceulizydodgsllfmh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>A Beautiful 3D Effect</h3><p>Our Magic Handles and Magic Acrylic Stands turn composites into art.</p><p>We coat them with natural, non-toxic fibers that carry light colors, patterns, and textures, add corrosion-resistant metals like brass, bronze, and aluminum, and finish them off with a polymer resin that binds the materials to create an eye-catching contrast and 3D depth.</p><p>This results in truly unique, semi-translucent, richly colored patterns that are truly a steal at our affordable prices.</p><div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/254098894?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h2><strong>REVIEWS</strong></h2><div>

<h2><strong>WHY KNIVESMASTERS ARE PERFECT FOR YOU</strong></h2>
<p>Whether you’re a professional chef or hobbyist, KNIVESMASTERS can take your craft to the next level. There is a misconception that the sharper the knives are the more dangerous they are – on the contrary, it’s duller knives that slip and nick your fingers while you cut and chop foods. A sharper knife means greater precision, less mishap, and more efficacy.</p>
<p>While a lot of high-end knives start out sharp, they quickly lose their edge. They have to be repeatedly sharpened, which not only costs time AND money, but over time the edge will be worn down to the point where it has to be professionally restored. </p>
<p>Unlike inferior knives, KNIVESMASTERS start out and stay razor sharp, perfectly holding their edges over long periods of time. No need for repeated sharpening, or having your knife professionally re-edged. Just consistent, professional-grade performance.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>WHAT IS REAL DAMASCUS STEEL?</strong></h2>
<p>Because ""Damascus steel"" is not a protected term, many cheap laminates are often sold as Damascus. Real Damascus steel consists of at least two complimentary knife steels, which are alternately presented in the cutting edge as thin layers.</p>
<p>The best Damascus steel knives in the world are made in Germany and Japan, and our team spent several years in both countries learning the art of and proper techniques for Damascus steel crafting before beginning development on our KNIVESMASTERS line.</p>
<p>Our handcrafted knives are made with high-quality components such as 1095 and 15N20, 1.1248, 1.2003, 1.2067, 1.3505, 1.2210 and other high class steels, with 50 to 100 layers per mm material thickness, and steel heated to more than 1,200 °c. The hardening and tempering of the finished blade is carried out by an experienced Damascus-smith, and we can display proof that these are genuine Damascus steel knives.</p>

The carbon steel makes them much tougher and less brittle than regular knife materials that wear away more easily over time. </p><h3><strong>What do the HRC Rockwell numbers mean?</strong></h3><p>This is a measure of the hardness of materials, particularly steel. The higher the number the harder the steel, but steel that is too hard can become more brittle, making it easier to shatter. At 59 to 62 HRC, ours fall within the ideal range of hardness and durability without being brittle.</p><h3><strong>What do you mean when you say the handles are STABILIZED?</strong></h3><p>The wooden handles have had all the air inside them removed and replaced with a special resin, in a complicated process that makes them almost completely resistant to heat, cold, moisture, and impact. </p><h3><strong>Is Aluminum-Strontium a safe material?</strong></h3><p>Yes. It is non-toxic and non-radioactive. Aluminum-Strontium is made from a composite of plant fibers and fine recycled aluminum shavings encapsulated in a translucent epoxy resin. It has a pale green to white color, then builds up a strong yellow-green glow that reflects various patterns on the aluminum shavings inside in light.</p><p> </p><h2>
<strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong> </h2><p>We have successfully developed and sold other products under our company, Bullet Proved, for years, and in the process have built an extensive network of reliable suppliers. </p><p>We believe in our knife manufacturing abilities and the reliability of our partners, though despite this there could be unforeseen delays, especially if our launch garners more orders than anticipated. As such, we have contingency plans in place, and alternative manufacturers ready to undertake any excess volume to ensure deliveries are still made in a timely manner.</p><p>We want our supporters to know that we take our responsibilities and promises seriously, and pledge to keep all interested parties fully informed and updated should any issues arise. We operate with full transparency so that you’ll always know where we stand.</p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518319166/puzj9katotg3knwbwzxu.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><h2> </h2><h2>HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE:</h2><p>If you’ve taken the time to read through our campaign, we’re willing to bet you have cooking knives sitting in your kitchen.

Handle
We are especially proud of the handles… because they feel exceptional in the hand. Also, the knife makers from ""KnivesMasters"" designed the black, red and golden materials based on the colors of the German flag. The exception is the Station Chef Knife with its Japanese colors.The handle is made of stabilized poplar wood. It is really handy and can be gripped comfortably, even with large hands.It's shape flows from rounded oval near the blade to a supportive square or oval profile at the back. This gives the optimum combination of comfort, support, and precision.The handle is also specially sealed and almost completely resistant to moisture, requiring only minimal care. It should not be left to sit in dishwater.Magic HandleWant your knife to be EVEN MORE exclusive?You can opt for the KNIVESMASTERS special Magic Handle, which incorporates very fine aluminum-strontium pigmentation into the material.This develops a strong reflective glow with exposure to light.A Beautiful 3D EffectOur Magic Handles and Magic Acrylic Stands turn composites into art.We coat them with natural, non-toxic fibers that carry light colors, patterns, and textures, add corrosion-resistant metals like brass, bronze, and aluminum, and finish them off with a polymer resin that binds the materials to create an eye-catching contrast and 3D depth.This results in truly unique, semi-translucent, richly colored patterns that are truly a steal at our affordable prices. REVIEWS
Our blades have been tested by both home cooks and professional chefs to develop a knife that can be intuitively used by anyone. After more than 36 months of design, testing, prototyping and creating sample batches, these are some samples of feedback we’ve received.


 

WHY KNIVESMASTERS ARE PERFECT FOR YOU
Whether you’re a professional chef or hobbyist, KNIVESMASTERS can take your craft to the next level. There is a misconception that the sharper the knives are the more dangerous they are – on the contrary, it’s duller knives that slip and nick your fingers while you cut and chop foods. A sharper knife means greater precision, less mishap, and more efficacy.
While a lot of high-end knives start out sharp, they quickly lose their edge. They have to be repeatedly sharpened, which not only costs time AND money, but over time the edge will be worn down to the point where it has to be professionally restored. 
Unlike inferior knives, KNIVESMASTERS start out and stay razor sharp, perfectly holding their edges over long periods of time. No need for repeated sharpening, or having your knife professionally re-edged. Just consistent, professional-grade performance.

 
WHAT IS REAL DAMASCUS STEEL?
Because ""Damascus steel"" is not a protected term, many cheap laminates are often sold as Damascus. Real Damascus steel consists of at least two complimentary knife steels, which are alternately presented in the cutting edge as thin layers.
The best Damascus steel knives in the world are made in Germany and Japan, and our team spent several years in both countries learning the art of and proper techniques for Damascus steel crafting before beginning development on our KNIVESMASTERS line.
Our handcrafted knives are made with high-quality components such as 1095 and 15N20, 1.1248, 1.2003, 1.2067, 1.3505, 1.2210 and other high class steels, with 50 to 100 layers per mm material thickness, and steel heated to more than 1,200 °c. The hardening and tempering of the finished blade is carried out by an experienced Damascus-smith, and we can display proof that these are genuine Damascus steel knives.

FAQHow do KNIVESMASTERS get and maintain their sharpness?The technique with which KNIVESMASTERS are crafted involves the very fine layering of extremely high-grade carbon steel, which is then manually sharpened on DMT Diamond-sharpeners to razor-sharpness. The carbon steel makes them much tougher and less brittle than regular knife materials that wear away more easily over time. What do the HRC Rockwell numbers mean?This is a measure of the hardness of materials, particularly steel. The higher the number the harder the steel, but steel that is too hard can become more brittle, making it easier to shatter. At 59 to 62 HRC, ours fall within the ideal range of hardness and durability without being brittle.What do you mean when you say the handles are STABILIZED?The wooden handles have had all the air inside them removed and replaced with a special resin, in a complicated process that makes them almost completely resistant to heat, cold, moisture, and impact. Is Aluminum-Strontium a safe material?Yes. It is non-toxic and non-radioactive. Aluminum-Strontium is made from a composite of plant fibers and fine recycled aluminum shavings encapsulated in a translucent epoxy resin. It has a pale green to white color, then builds up a strong yellow-green glow that reflects various patterns on the aluminum shavings inside in light. 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES We have successfully developed and sold other products under our company, Bullet Proved, for years, and in the process have built an extensive network of reliable suppliers. We believe in our knife manufacturing abilities and the reliability of our partners, though despite this there could be unforeseen delays, especially if our launch garners more orders than anticipated.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The inspirational story behind SophiPet </i></p>
<p>During the recession several years ago in a town far, far away, my wife and I decided to lift our spirits by driving around to find the perfect bridge… that we would be living under. It was at that time I began to feel the bark side of the force when my wife requested on behalf of her boss that I design and build a set of dog stairs for her boss’s dog Babe, who sadly broke her back jumping from a high bed using a short step stool. Before the recession, I designed and made complex human staircases, so, after some heated discussion, and ...my wife apparently using the “Jedi Mind Trick”, I somehow grudgingly agreed to do it. Her boss noted in a list: ""The stairs need to reach my 40” high bed, can’t stick out too far in the room, and if possible, match my upscale style and bedroom décor."" So I turned to the internet for inspiration.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/7J4HTIBgmhbxoqc5Ar/giphy.gif"" src=""""/><i>Help me Google-Wan Kenobi, you’re my only hope!</i> What I was shown is a whole galaxy of small-dog-lovin’ people out there with quadrupeds getting hurt from high beds, which makes sense because it's the equivalent of a person jumping from the roof of a one-story building. Imagine doing that several times a day to be near the one you love! After seeing the feeble solutions to this preventable tragedy, I felt a great disturbance in the force. And when I later heard of “Babe’s” death, I knew It was time to fulfill my destiny and ""turn to the bark side"" by creating the world's greatest patented pet staircase, SophiPet. <span style=""display: none;""> </span><a href=""https://uncommonmakers.com/blogs/news/turned-to-the-bark-side-inventing-the-sophipet-staircase"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read Full Story</a></p>

<p>When collaborating with a client to design a custom staircase for their home, to fit their needs &amp; style, a checklist is taken to accomplish this. This checklist would include: What style handrail? Stain or paint &amp; what colors? Specialty finishes: Patina, Satin Black, Pewter Vein? Which tread carpet design? etc. This is the same checklist SophiPet will offer with our <i>D-I-T</i> or <i>Design-It-Together</i> pet staircases. Alongside the inventor of SophiPet, William Moore, you and our design team can collaborate to create a custom SophiPet staircase to match your space by utilizing your photos, color swatches, and fabrics.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>In-House Manufacturing</strong>- With our entry into the mass-production market, initially streamlining the production line is going to take some work and time; however, being familiar with logistics processes and project management, we are confident we can accomplish our objectives. With a combined 30+ years of experience in the woodwork manufacturing business, long-standing relationships with material, supplies, and packaging resources, vast knowledge &amp; experience using production equipment (i.e. CNC Machines, wide-belt sanders, finishing processes, production saws), we have understood and adapted to the production line process on various projects over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Complex Order Fulfillment</strong> - It's not hard to see the difficulty in reward fulfillment with as many rewards as we offer. In a dream world, everything works out perfectly and everyone gets their rewards exactly on time, every time. In our world, the real world, expected &amp; unexpected problems arise from all directions. With our list of reward tiers offered, executing the fulfillment is going to take some know-how, problem solving and honing to get it running smoothly. Once funded, we are confident that our strategic planning will be able to get the job done, proactively tackling challenges and getting the rewards to you with the indiegogo definition of “on time.”</p>
<p><strong>Product Adjustments</strong> - Creativity and quality never ceases. Again, from experience, we find better and faster ways to produce top-of-the-line products with a little fine tuning here and there, all to better benefit your experience as the end user. Some people don’t like surprises, so we aim to keep you up to date on any improvements made.</p>

The inspirational story behind SophiPet 
During the recession several years ago in a town far, far away, my wife and I decided to lift our spirits by driving around to find the perfect bridge… that we would be living under. It was at that time I began to feel the bark side of the force when my wife requested on behalf of her boss that I design and build a set of dog stairs for her boss’s dog Babe, who sadly broke her back jumping from a high bed using a short step stool. Before the recession, I designed and made complex human staircases, so, after some heated discussion, and ...my wife apparently using the “Jedi Mind Trick”, I somehow grudgingly agreed to do it. Her boss noted in a list: ""The stairs need to reach my 40” high bed, can’t stick out too far in the room, and if possible, match my upscale style and bedroom décor."" So I turned to the internet for inspiration.  
Help me Google-Wan Kenobi, you’re my only hope! What I was shown is a whole galaxy of small-dog-lovin’ people out there with quadrupeds getting hurt from high beds, which makes sense because it's the equivalent of a person jumping from the roof of a one-story building. Imagine doing that several times a day to be near the one you love! After seeing the feeble solutions to this preventable tragedy, I felt a great disturbance in the force. And when I later heard of “Babe’s” death, I knew It was time to fulfill my destiny and ""turn to the bark side"" by creating the world's greatest patented pet staircase, SophiPet.  Read Full Story

What Inspires you? 
When collaborating with a client to design a custom staircase for their home, to fit their needs & style, a checklist is taken to accomplish this. This checklist would include: What style handrail? Stain or paint & what colors? Specialty finishes: Patina, Satin Black, Pewter Vein? Which tread carpet design? etc. This is the same checklist SophiPet will offer with our D-I-T or Design-It-Together pet staircases. Alongside the inventor of SophiPet, William Moore, you and our design team can collaborate to create a custom SophiPet staircase to match your space by utilizing your photos, color swatches, and fabrics.

Petree uses most of the garbage bags on the market. It greatly reduces the workload of daily maintenance. 
You no longer need to clean the cat litter box by hand. 
Automatic Petree keeps your home clean and comfortable!
Enjoy life with your cat and don’t worry about picking up cat waste anymore, Petree’s got you!
We all know that cats like to be clean! Our series of tests agree that cats like a clean and comfortable litter box environment.A cat litter box that is always clean will help eliminate health risks involved with our furry friends.
 Begone toxins
Cat feces has been studied and shown to contain a disease called toxoplasmosis.
Symptoms include fever, fatigue, and muscle pain -- which can cause many complications: especially in pregnant women and young children.
And there’s a bonus 
Petree' s extreme litter efficiency saves you 3 times the amount of cat litter than when using a traditional litter box. Petree potentially reduces litter costs up to $300 a year!
With 300 extra a year you can buy your own Petree and never worry about stinky litter and accidentally touching cat feces that can make you and your family sick!
 The carbon filter ordo management system effectively controls the smell of litter in the dumpster. Easy to maintainPetree is designed to be sturdy and durable, and it can be clean in as little as five minutes.Just press the buttons on both sides and unscrew two screws to take the ball out to the garden and flush it with a hose. The silicone containerPetree's intelligent design can remove odors in a variety of ways, not by jut removing cat poop. The material inside the container is CAT-certified elastic non-viscid silicone -- tailored for Petree's rotating and deodorizing functions.The soft elasticity inside thoroughly removes any residues when it rotates to clean. Petree has been tested more than 2,000 times without failing to make sure your cat always has a comfortable and fresh place to do his business. Blends into your home like a piece of furniturePetree doesn't look like a traditional cat litter box or an industrial prototype. Designed with minimalist aesthetics, it can be used as a background or as a centerpiece in the room. It is also easy to maintain and never looks out of place. The safety of cats is a recurring consideration in our designA furry friend can often be a playful little thing, so we optimized our design for Petree by considering a range of possible safety issues from the start. Gravity induction systemThere are currently two types of sensing systems used in cat litter boxes, infrared and gravity.Infrared can be unstable under certain conditions, such as its sensor receivers getting blocked creating blind spots where the machine would not recognize that your cat is still inside and activate the cleaning process.We knew that simple structures were more reliable, so we decided to use the principle of gravity induction to ensure safety.We selected products with excellent accuracy and stability, trying more than 20 kinds of gravity sensors from different suppliers to achieve the best matching and using effect with Petree.Four gravity sensors are installed on the bottom; When your cat enters the grain box the sensors will detect it’s presence immediately so that the machine will do not enter the cleaning cycle. Also,  the sensors will signal to stop the machine if it is already rotating when your cat goes in. Why did we design the trash can in the back?Cat litter boxes on the market now have a trash can at the bottom.That design is easy to use and relatively easy to design and build, but it makes for a great safety issue.If a cat enters the machine while it is working it could get stuck in the gap between the ball and the bin, with terrible consequences.I'm sure some of you have heard of similar incidents before! I think nothing is more important than the safety of the cats, so we went through many experiments, modifying repeatedly, coming up with a revolutionary trash can installed to Petree’s back. The sphere and garbage opening are not connected so your cat won't be in danger of getting stuck. Petree also contains the double protection of accelerometer making the machine hazard-free. How do we determine the shape and structure of Petree?We extensively studied the shape, size, movement, and habits of cats to determine the best materials and structures to accommodate them. We started developing the initial 2 versions of the 3rd standard spherical model and focused on testing the ideal size. The final design has the entrance in the lower position. In our studies, we found that a lower entrance will help any small or big, old, or young cat quickly adapt and easily enter and exit the machine every time. Another advantage of this design is to ensure that the overall structure of Pettree is very stable by achieving perfect balance and not overturning.If the entrance is designed as a plane, could potentially trap the cat inside and leaving it in danger of suffocation.So, from the side, as you can see, we made a high and low design so that in case of a roll we could eliminate the possibility of suffocation. Bite proof power cableThe power cables are specially designed to ensure that they don't break and electrocute a cat in case they bite it. Very quiet workPetree's peak volume is only 30 dbAs – you would barely be able to hear Petree working making it almost a silent machine. Thanks to our carefully selected brushless motor and soundproof design, Pettree will not make so much noise as other machines.Petree won’t be disturbing your family or your cat! Just a few of our happy users! Whats in the box Option item Petree Cat Litter Box CurtainThis cat litter box curtain is specially designed for Petree Litter Box.

<p>The All-In-Sensor app integrates with your smart home devices and allows you to respond with appropriate and immediate responses.</p> <p>Say you own a vacation home that occasionally you let others rent. Before your visitors arrive, you can know the temperature, security, and status of the entire home. You can prepare it for their arrival by turning on lights, the water heater, and adjusting the thermostat. You can monitor when they arrive, when they leave, and what amenities they use. And you can make sure that the place is safe and secure when they leave.</p>

For example, if it is night and it is dark and movement is detected, the light will switch on. Or, if there is too much moisture in the bathroom, the window will open. With a smart power plug you can switch  on/off any electric device like lights, music, air conditioning, heat and so on.</p>
<p>Very helpful: you create your own smart processes just with few clicks on your smartphone, the new technology allows the cooperation of up to 5 sensors in the All-In-Sensor to control your electric devices in any way you want.</p> <h1>FOR LOCAL USE AND CONTROL, USE YOUR OWN SMARTPHONE</h1>

<p>If you are in the proximity of the All-In-Sensor or switches (in buildings up to 50m / 150ft or an open field up to 150m / 500ft), all signals can be received and sent directly with your smartphone / tablet.</p>
<p><br/><span>Neither a Wifi nor internet or cellular connection is required for this.</span></p> <p>You operate your own private local network, this is possible at any place you want.</p>
<p>You install the AIS Center App directly onto your Android smartphone / tablet and can use all functions directly. (The iOS App is in the works and will be available in time with All-In-Sensor delivery)</p> <h1>FOR REMOTE USE AND CONTROL, USE THE CONNECTOR TO ACT AS LOCAL CONTROL CENTER</h1>
<p>If you want to use the signals over long distances, you need the Connector in the area of your All-In-Sensors or switches. The Connector establishes a connection between the All-In-Sensor and switches to your (far away) smartphone / tablet. This connection is made via a secure M2M (machine to machine) cellular connection and works worldwide. </p>
<p><span>No data is stored on cloud servers, this gives you 100% data and hacker protection. </span> The DST- Connector can manage up to 99 sensors and smart switches in its environment and can be used at any place, indoor and outdoor, also moble in vehicles.</p>

<p>The weatherproof housing of the connector allows the use at any place and a world sim card for direct contact to your smartphone is also already cost free integrated.</p>
<p><br/>The special Direct-Smarter SIM card is already included in the connector and automatically logs into the stronger cellular network, regardless of where you use the connector. Mobile use (e.g. in vehicles) is also possible.</p>
<p><br/>The data volume for an average usage period of 5 years is already included on the Direct-Smarter SIM card; if necessary, it can be extended at any time for a $49.</p> <p>For intensive data traffic, the connector can also be connected to the local WiFi network, the Direct-Smarter SIM card then works as a backup if the WiFi connection is disturbed. </p>
<p><br/>The Connector is delivered ready for use, no registration or contract conclusion is required and there are no monthly costs.</p> <p>To connect your smartphone to the connector, you will install the AIS Receiver app for Android or IOS on your smartphone / tablet.</p>
<p><br/>It enables a direct connection to the connector, the All-In-Sensor and switches.  The AIS Receiver app is available in IOS store and google play.</p> <div data-id=""32766911""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/032/766/911/c1fee628a07a842ab74ab36f88974370_original.png?ixlib=rb-4.0.2&amp;auto=compress%2Cformat&amp;q=1&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1615934730&amp;frame=1&amp;s=4f624c49798688bb10628042182dc78e"" src=""""/></figure></div>

All-In-Sensor information in every sensor

 
Intelligent control of any device with just a few clicks. Smart home control couldn't be easier.

 
All-In-Sensor control of all devices from any place worldwide

 


The All-In-Sensor has an endless range of potential applications, see some suggestions for use in below PDF link 
 


With the All-In-Sensor and your smartphone, you can control, secure, measure and monitor any space you want. An All-In-Sensor can monitor a whole room up to approximately 50 square meters (540 sq ft) for all common hazards and control any of the space's smart home devices.



The All-In-Sensor is connected with a smartphone via a special Bluetooth signal. This smartphone works as a ""control center"". It can be your smartphone if you are in the range of the All-In-Sensor or you use the Direct-Smarter Connector if you are far away. 
It uses Bluetooth 4.2 LE and has a range of about 30m (100ft) indoors and 150m (500ft) outdoors. 

Each sensor and function can be turned on individually and adjusted to your desired sensitivity. You can also set up alarms, notifications, and even actions that are triggered if a sensor’s set threshold is reached.


In case of an alarm or an event like the motion detector triggers or the room temperature rises above 30°C (86°F), the All-In-Sensor sends a signal to your smartphone. The smartphone makes an loud alarm or inform other people via call, SMS, mail or push notification.
When you use the AIS Receiver App on your smartphone, you will get the information 1 second after the event occur via Push Notification.


The All-In-Sensor app integrates with your smart home devices and allows you to respond with appropriate and immediate responses. Say you own a vacation home that occasionally you let others rent. Before your visitors arrive, you can know the temperature, security, and status of the entire home. You can prepare it for their arrival by turning on lights, the water heater, and adjusting the thermostat. You can monitor when they arrive, when they leave, and what amenities they use. And you can make sure that the place is safe and secure when they leave.
Specific technologies will continually be developed and added
With our smart home power plug, you have the ability to respond to any alert, alarm, or condition by turning on/off the light, radio, air conditioning, heater, or appliance. You can control your smart home devices manually, or you can pre-program a response in the All-In-Sensor app.
We are already working on MQTT for connecting the All-In-Sensor with other smart home systems like Philips Hue, Apple Homekit and so on, so that you can use them together if you like.
 The All-In-Sensor app allows you to program actions that your smart home will take if certain sensor thresholds are triggered. For example, if it is night and it is dark and movement is detected, the light will switch on. Or, if there is too much moisture in the bathroom, the window will open. With a smart power plug you can switch  on/off any electric device like lights, music, air conditioning, heat and so on.
Very helpful: you create your own smart processes just with few clicks on your smartphone, the new technology allows the cooperation of up to 5 sensors in the All-In-Sensor to control your electric devices in any way you want. FOR LOCAL USE AND CONTROL, USE YOUR OWN SMARTPHONE

 
If you are in the proximity of the All-In-Sensor or switches (in buildings up to 50m / 150ft or an open field up to 150m / 500ft), all signals can be received and sent directly with your smartphone / tablet.
Neither a Wifi nor internet or cellular connection is required for this. You operate your own private local network, this is possible at any place you want.
You install the AIS Center App directly onto your Android smartphone / tablet and can use all functions directly. (The iOS App is in the works and will be available in time with All-In-Sensor delivery) FOR REMOTE USE AND CONTROL, USE THE CONNECTOR TO ACT AS LOCAL CONTROL CENTER
If you want to use the signals over long distances, you need the Connector in the area of your All-In-Sensors or switches. The Connector establishes a connection between the All-In-Sensor and switches to your (far away) smartphone / tablet. This connection is made via a secure M2M (machine to machine) cellular connection and works worldwide. 
No data is stored on cloud servers, this gives you 100% data and hacker protection.  The DST- Connector can manage up to 99 sensors and smart switches in its environment and can be used at any place, indoor and outdoor, also moble in vehicles.

The weatherproof housing of the connector allows the use at any place and a world sim card for direct contact to your smartphone is also already cost free integrated.
The special Direct-Smarter SIM card is already included in the connector and automatically logs into the stronger cellular network, regardless of where you use the connector. Mobile use (e.g. in vehicles) is also possible.
The data volume for an average usage period of 5 years is already included on the Direct-Smarter SIM card; if necessary, it can be extended at any time for a $49. For intensive data traffic, the connector can also be connected to the local WiFi network, the Direct-Smarter SIM card then works as a backup if the WiFi connection is disturbed. 
The Connector is delivered ready for use, no registration or contract conclusion is required and there are no monthly costs. To connect your smartphone to the connector, you will install the AIS Receiver app for Android or IOS on your smartphone / tablet.
It enables a direct connection to the connector, the All-In-Sensor and switches.  The AIS Receiver app is available in IOS store and google play. 
We proudly introduce Direct-Smarter Technology with the All-In-Sensor, a solution that requires no Internet connection, no registration of user accounts, and no complicated installations. Direct-Smarter Technology allows the All-In-Sensor to be a wireless transmitter that can be used anywhere, with end-to-end encryption and complete data protection.

 
Camera surveillance is an important topic. But cases of cameras being hacked keep increasing. Who knows if someone is watching you through your camera without you noticing.
With our technology, only you have access, because the camera is only active when you are using it. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</div></div>","Meet the FLOW™ by Simpleware® 



Why are we on Indiegogo?

We have reinvented our 2012 
invention, FLOW™ cutting board, after learning more about pricing in the 
U.S. marketplace, creating ECO FLOW™ with every intention of bringing 
this now affordable, elite kitchen product to consumers on a domestic and (hopefully) a global scale! With
 YOUR help!


The World's First Perforated Cutting Board Design! 



The FLOW™ and our newly designed ECO FLOW™ by Simpleware®  is a revolutionary cutting board sure to solve the countertop mess by enabling liquids and drippings to flow through the cutting surface into the tray beneath, thus keeping your countertops (and kitchen) clean.



What can ECO FLOW™ by Simpleware® do?


10% smaller, and using 30% less material and fewer 
manufacturing steps. The new revolutionary ECO FLOW™ cutting board 
maintains all of the premium features of the original FLOW™ - minus the 
premium price tag. 50% less expensive.



Check out our ECO FLOW™ design renderings:





Provide ease-of-use to Chefs in commercial setting
Supports Food & Safety Regulation compliance


Eliminate cross-contamination


Easily separate foods as required by some faiths (i.e. Kosher, Halal)

Keep countertops clean

Collects juices to be used in sauces

Eliminates the drippy mess associated with thawing frozen foods

Dishwasher Safe

BPA free 

FDA approved



Fits right in your cabinets (10"" x 14"")


That means it's  big enough for your holiday ham, roast, and even that beer Turducken you've been wanting to try! The Concept Is Simple and Works!



By perforating the cutting surface - juices easily pass through, whereas with other cutting boards, juices gravitate to the outer edges, create a wet mess.  

Preventing food-borne illnesses can be easy if you have the proper tools for safe cooking. This is especially important when preparing fish, poultry and meats.



Furthermore, by having a interchangeable boards from the tray beneath, you can simply click in a different colored cutting surface, and you're easily on to the next preparation. You keep foods separated while still trapping all of the liquids in the same tray without having to sanitize in between. 

FLOW™ (Cobalt Blue): 



Safety First!


Try that with a traditional cutting board!


What's more, these FDA approved, BPA free cutting boards are dishwasher safe, so you can focus on bacteria prevention for even your smaller Chefs wanting to help out in the kitchen, too!

FLOW™ (Orange):
FLOW™ is safer than conventional cutting boards:



Rubberized feet create a stable, safe cutting surface.

The non-slip tray reduces risk of accidents, making it ideal for young Chefs.
The interchangeable cutting surfaces reduce risk of cross-contamination.

Kid safe

The materials used for the board are safe on knives, won't dull your fine blades

Simpleware® products are BPA free


Dishwasher safe, designed to fit in any dishwasher for a thorough sanitation.






The choice is Simple. Easy. Baby safe. Mother approved! With the 
FLOW™ cutting board in your kitchen, you can focus on food preparation 
and not on yours and your family's safety.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact of CLI-M-IT™</h3>
<p>CLI-M-IT™ WILL help everyone, young and old, and people of all abilities. It removes the necessity of having a ladder or a dresser under a window. Instead, the CLI-M-IT™ will be fit into your wall, with nothing protruding to obstruct movement in the room. It eliminates the worry of temporary solutions like ladders that go missing and dressers being moved or falling. Parents, landlords and caretakers have peace of mind, knowing there is always a safe way out in emergencies. If the stairs are impassable, climb out. If smoke or darkness limits your vision, the L.E.D. lighting will guide you to the CLI-M-IT™. </p>

Instead, the CLI-M-IT™ will be fit into your wall, with nothing protruding to obstruct movement in the room. It eliminates the worry of temporary solutions like ladders that go missing and dressers being moved or falling. Parents, landlords and caretakers have peace of mind, knowing there is always a safe way out in emergencies. If the stairs are impassable, climb out. If smoke or darkness limits your vision, the L.E.D. lighting will guide you to the CLI-M-IT™.

We are a company that has invented THRONE - the next big step in home and building automation. Automation as it is supposed to be: accessible, clear and really helpful.</span><br/></b></p><p>In today’s world computing technology advanced so far, but most of people’s homes still remain dumb. Home automation haven’t yet turned to a mainstream. Currently we see several major limitations preventing home automation from becoming a really wide spread thing. And we have the answers to these challenges.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462903992/Locus_02_h600_ybwrtq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462904146/LOCUS_grey_caption_600_hyd2dk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h2>Challenge 1. User interface</h2><p>A traditional concept of a smart home UI doesn’t bring anything new to the user experience. In fact, it just collects some switchers within a touch screen. </p><p><i>The industry needs a fundamentally new concept: clear, efficient, and scalable. An interface which is capable to visualize the control of several IoT gadgets in your home or thousands of systems and sensors in an airport - and keep the control equally clear and intuitive. </i></p><p></p><p>What if you have more than one controlled device at home? Would that be good to have several applications, one for each device? What if you have not 1-3 controlled lights, but 20 or more? In traditional interface it will look as a long list of numbered devices. Is that a convenient way of control your home?</p><h2>Answer. A Reality Related User Interface</h2><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>Discover THRONE. A completely different approach to the concept of an interface for smart home or smart building. THRONE’s UI is based on a 3D scheme of the controlled facility. And all the devices are mapped on this 3D scheme. The concept, giving a perfect intuitiveness and having no limitations in scalability.</p>The best word for a person is his name. The best place for a person is his home. The best way to control your home is to see its scheme - rotateable, zoomable… clear. Years of research guided us to the conclusion: a 3D scheme is the most clear, intuitive and fast way to monitor and manage all things at a facility.<br/><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F165786292&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F165786292&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F569728400_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>That is how we’ve invented THRONE - a smart home control system which has a 3D scheme of a controlled facility as a basis idea of the whole user experience.

<h2>DIY vs PRO systems</h2>
<p>Controlling one device from your smart home? What is it besides fun? How can this be really helpful? We are sure that the true value of smart home concept is a capability of monitoring, control, and automatic actions. All these capabilities should provide you security, health, comfort, and energy (money) saving. </p>
<p>In order to be a real system, the devices should cooperate with each other and augment each other’s functionality. The trending today IoT gadgets don’t provide a true system because of several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>not all of them can cooperate between each other; </li>
<li>mostly they don’t have common control environment: they operate in different protocols and most of the devices have their own application for control;</li>
<li>each new gadget makes you install a new application to your smartphone, and switch between these apps, when you need to change something in your home;</li>
<li>even if you picked up the devices of one protocol (e.g. Z-Wave), they can be incompatible with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>So one device, even if it a compicated like a thermostat, is not yet a smart home system. But even professional companies often design a smart home solution around one feature, e.g. security or multimedia. </p>
<p>We researched for a long time to find out the pros and cons of DIY and PRO approaches to home automation. Today we can say that both concepts have their advantages, but problems as well.</p>

</div>","- Hi! We are a company that has invented THRONE - the next big step in home and building automation. Automation as it is supposed to be: accessible, clear and really helpful.In today’s world computing technology advanced so far, but most of people’s homes still remain dumb. Home automation haven’t yet turned to a mainstream. Currently we see several major limitations preventing home automation from becoming a really wide spread thing. And we have the answers to these challenges.Challenge 1. User interfaceA traditional concept of a smart home UI doesn’t bring anything new to the user experience. In fact, it just collects some switchers within a touch screen. The industry needs a fundamentally new concept: clear, efficient, and scalable. An interface which is capable to visualize the control of several IoT gadgets in your home or thousands of systems and sensors in an airport - and keep the control equally clear and intuitive. What if you have more than one controlled device at home? Would that be good to have several applications, one for each device? What if you have not 1-3 controlled lights, but 20 or more? In traditional interface it will look as a long list of numbered devices. Is that a convenient way of control your home?Answer. A Reality Related User InterfaceDiscover THRONE. A completely different approach to the concept of an interface for smart home or smart building. THRONE’s UI is based on a 3D scheme of the controlled facility. And all the devices are mapped on this 3D scheme. The concept, giving a perfect intuitiveness and having no limitations in scalability.The best word for a person is his name. The best place for a person is his home. The best way to control your home is to see its scheme - rotateable, zoomable… clear. Years of research guided us to the conclusion: a 3D scheme is the most clear, intuitive and fast way to monitor and manage all things at a facility.That is how we’ve invented THRONE - a smart home control system which has a 3D scheme of a controlled facility as a basis idea of the whole user experience. All devices are binded to their real locations so you can easily reach them. At the same time you can operate groups of devices visible on the screen. This is like WYSWYG concept for your smart home.
Just install THRONE demo app and see how easy it is to switch the lights

or set the temperature

or watch the stream of video cameras

or instantly see the triggering of the alarms

THRONE app with a native 3D engine provides an ultimate ease and clarity of control due to the reality-related user interface.Install free THRONE demo


If you want more than just a demo, you can try a working THRONE system right now. Pay attention to our perks. Some of them allow to try THRONE with 50% discount. These conditions are valid within the Indiegogo campaign only!Challenge 2. IntegrationA true benefit of a Smart home concept is an ability of control the whole house. Not just one bulb, but all the lighting fixtures if differend kinds together. Not just one type of functionality like temperature, but all systems and devices at once. Moreover, the systems and devices should see each other and cooperate providing maximum comfort and security.Today’s Connected Home market offers you plenty of options. But if you look deeper, you will find that making a real smart home system is not an easy task. You can buy some so-called DIY solutions and install it by yourself. But making these gadgets work together is nearly impossible. You can hire professional installers, but they prefer to work with old-school systems which give them more margin. These systems are expensive and inflexible: hard to expand or upgrade. And most of all, this approach makes you completely dependable on the installers' skills and diligence.Answer. LOCUS Smart Home HubTHRONE is a system for managing 3rd party smart home devices. Your lighting fixtures, thermostats, alarms, cameras and more. With THRONE you control all of them in a single app. THRONE learns how you use electronic stuff at home and gradually makes more and more things happen automatically. It helps you skip routine manual setup and adjusting of your devices. THRONE is a smart home hub, a smart home constructor and an app with reality-based user interface. Together they are a Next-Gen Learning Smart Home system.Components of the systemDiscover LOCUS. A smart home hub in a form factor of wall-mount dock-station for iPad. LOCUS supports various protocols of wired and wireless systems. It is a heart of THRONE system. It collects, stores and processes the data from all devices, provides synching and logic. THRONE LOCUS works locally in your home that guarantees more security and less delays. For remote access you can use direct VPN connection between your mobile device and your home network.LOCUS is a smart home hub embedded in a wall-mount dock with both a built-in charging unit and air purity sensor. It also has a proximity sensor, so it wakes up when you approach. LOCUS comes in premium-finished aluminium frame.

LOCUS Tech SpecsAPPLICATION PROCESSOR: 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPUMEMORY: 2 Gb LPDDR3 + 16 GB eMMCWIFI 802.11 b/g/n/ac. Bluetooth BT 4.0 / BLE. IEEE 802.15.4Z-WAVE Plus, ZIGBEE, THREADProximity sensor for activation on approach. Other sensors: temperature, humidity, CO2, air purity. Brushed aluminium finishing.Built-in LogicThere are some solutions that promise you to connect everything. OK, but what’s next? With THRONE your devices are connected AND can interact for cooperation. For example, the lights can automatically turn on if the presence sensor detects someone walking nearby and the lux sensor detects that it is dark outside. Sounds like a PRO system, right? But THRONE allows to make simple IoT devices to work like that. And what’s important - you can easily change the pre-set scripts or set up this logic by yourself.Learning system instead of programmingWe are sure that a modern smart home should be more than just a way of control. It should understand the behaviour of the house inhabitants and offer them the ways to save their time and reach more comfort. The smart home system should strive to minimize the frequency of manual operations of the owner. And surely the owner shouldn’t be a professional to program the scripts of his smart home.THRONE gives you freedom without staring on the screen of your device. The system memorizes how you use electronic devices at home and gradually makes more and more things happen automatically. It helps to get rid of routine manual switching and adjusting devices. It saves your time… and cuts the bills.Imagine that you don’t need any switchers anymore. Imagine that the lights are following you while you stroll through your home and automatically turn of where they are not needed. With THRONE this is possible.THRONE Right Now With Razberry THRONE LOCUS Hub will be developed as a result of this campaign. If you can't wait to try THRONE, you can do it RIGHT NOW!THRONE LOCUS Hub will be developed as a result of this campaign.

The basic explanation is given in the perks description in the end of the story. This perk is offered with 50% from regular price.Challenge 3. Ease of setupThere are thousands of ‘smart’ devices on the market. When you think of adding some ‘smart’ features to your home, it can be not so easy to pick up the devices that will be compatible with each other. Of course, you can hire an installer company, but that makes you dependent on their expertise. Besides thay can be expensive or brand-biased. That’s why THRONE gives you a simple online Smart Home Constructor. 

Answer. THRONE Smart Home Drag’n’drop Constructor
We are sure that it’s time to uberize smart home configuration and installation. In the modern world a customer should have an opportunity to choose the systems according to the functionality and design.

<h3>Hi!</h3>
<p>My name is Bruno Loureiro. I'm the creator of Live Frames. I have always been passionate about nature and plants. As a child, I used to play in my grandparent’s house with wild flowers, clovers and mushrooms, creating amazing stories full of action. As an adult, I studied genetics and specialized in vegetal and plant tissues. Nowadays, I still love creating with plants. I want people to enjoy natural plants in their homes and offices, by turning them into a beautiful, living and self-sustainable piece of art.</p>

</div></div>","Live Frames - The Sustainable Way! 
Live Frames are self-sustainable by absorbing the water and nutrients in the gel and reusing the water inside over and over again while grow. At same time with Live Frames you could save hundreds of litters of water per year, while still having real plants as a piece of art and an example of sustainability.  

 
Live Frames give more than beauty!
Live Frames emit tranquillity and have a relaxing effect. They show the importance of real plants both for the environment and for us. All parts of Live Frames are reusable or biodegradable and the plants could be transplanted to normal pot and They are not only beautiful products, but also have an educational function: they remind us how plants work. In this campaign we express the importance of real plants and saving water. 

 
A piece of art!
To put these pieces of art in the market we create this campaign aims to reduce the cost price of production, so the Live Frames can be sustainable on the market. The objective is to produce and sell the Live Frames at a reasonable price, so more people can enjoy a piece of nature prepared for nowadays: a natural plant that doesn’t need watering or care, but only needs light.

 

Why crowdfunding!
To be able to create a sustainable production system to offer the products on the market, we need 5000 €. It will help us to have an efficient assembly line with production costs and to be able to produce the highest quality Live Frames. With this campaign, we hope not only to raise funds, but also to receive your comments and feedback on how Live Frames can be enhanced because they are made for you. 



 
You will always be rewarded!
As a reward for your contribution, you will receive a Live Frame especially produced for you. The contribution required to receive this reward will be lower then the price for the product after it has been put on the market. In addition, the product will be customized to your wishes : . You can choose any color you want the gel in - even colors that won’t be used in the production line afterwards.

<h3><strong>How this all began</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Gina Seneca, proud founder of <strong>Kiki Torches</strong>! The inspiration came to me after each time my husband and I threw away a set of tiki torches and shuffled off to the local home improvement store, where we were presented with the same old selection. There were certain features and functions I wanted in a tiki torch, but couldn't find anywhere. So, I decided to invent them myself, and thus <strong>Kiki Torches</strong> were born!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588974263/mpdzr0qopggrtqnrz1tx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Kiki Torches</strong> provides such a beautiful ambiance to any outdoor time!  There is something so calming about the flickering flame of a torch. <strong>Kiki Torches</strong> illuminates outdoor spaces and sets the mood.!The ability to personalize your <strong>Kiki Torches</strong> takes the outdoor events, experience &amp; entertaining to an all-new level!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>After a long career inside Corporate America, I wanted something more and was ready to take control of my life, my future and my finances.  After watching hours of the television show ""Shark Tank"", where entrepreneurs present their inventions to a panel of ""sharks/investors"" who can help make their invention a reality, I knew I could do it! If they could do it, why can't I? </p>
<p>This campaign allows me to create the ""All-American Dream"" of owning my own business. Being no stranger to financial challenges, I'm longing for that slice of the American pie! A big portion of my motivation roots from seeking stability for not only myself and my family, but for my mother, who I currently care for full time.</p>

<h3>What Inspired this Project</h3>
<p>My name is Alma Ohene-Opare. I am a software engineer with more than a decade of experience in solving complex technology-related problems. I am also the inventor and principal engineer of the SafeLyfe Alpha and I am excited to embark on this journey with you. A few years ago, I learned of a grim statistic about the impact of prescription drug abuse in the United States. I was profoundly affected and determined to find a way to help protect families from the epidemic.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553274247/zwc7jkmakvy9uvckayej.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After some research, I discovered that most victims of prescription drug addiction became addicts by accident.  In most cases, they were prescribed powerful opioids to treat legitimate pain. The problem occurs when they are left to themselves to manage how often and how many pills they take. So, I as pondered a possible solution to accidental addiction, I knew it had to be focused on creating oversight and accountability in the daily dispensing of the prescribed doses.</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>The SafeLyfe Alpha is the world's first smart safe designed primarily to bring accountability and oversight to the dispensing of medication.</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YeDHkgjRrM0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>

<p>The SafeLyfe Alpha is not like any other safe. The following are a few features that make the safe unique:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>No Buttons, Keypads or Keys: </strong>The SafeLyfe Alpha can only be controlled from a smartphone configured to communicate securely with the safe. This design methodology is crucial to accomplishing the stated goal of the safe, which includes limiting avenues for unauthorized access to the safe's contents. Without buttons or keys, the only people who can open the safe are those with physical access to the authorized smartphone and the SafeLyfe app and are within proximity of the safe.</li>
<li>
<strong>Multi-Factor Authentication: </strong>Another unique feature of the SafeLyfe Alpha is that it is the only safe that uses multi-factor authentication. In order to provide accountability and oversight, the safe can be configured to require more than one person to approve access to its contents. When a user attempts to unlock the safe by pushing a button on their smartphone, one or more users will be notified of the request. They have to approve access before the safe unlocks ensuring complete accountability.</li>
<li>
<strong>Built-In HD Camera: </strong>To provide more oversight and accountability, the SafeLyfe Alpha has a built-in camera that automatically records as soon as the safe is open. The recorded video is live and can be viewed by the person or persons authorizing access to the safe in real-time. The wide-angle camera lens allows viewers to see both the contents of the safe as well as the person accessing the safe.</li>
<li>
<strong>Portable:</strong> The SafeLyfe Alpha is portable and lightweight and can fit in a regular backpack. The safe can be used at home, college dorm room or on the go.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Be Part of the Solution to a Nationwide Epidemic</h3>
<p>You can make a huge difference with your contribution. Supporting our campaign will put you on the frontlines in the fight against the nationwide epidemic of opioid drug abuse and overdoses. You will be helping build a life-saving product that could impact hundreds of thousands of lives in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>It is estimated that most people know someone who is affected in some way by the opioid epidemic. Whether you know someone personally or not, you cannot escape its impact. Even if it has not affected you at this time, it is crucial and imperative to take precautions to protect your family today and your support will go a long way to make this a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Currently, we need to raise <strong>$100,000</strong> to make this project a reality. The funds raised will be used to accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the injection molds required to manufacture the safe.</li>
<li>Engineer the circuit board, video recording system, and firmware for the safe.</li>
<li>Develop a mobile app that will enable access to the safe.</li>
<li>Create an e-commerce website for the sale and marketing of the safe.</li>
<li>Seek partnerships with advocacy groups and organizations to help drive sales.</li>
<li>Purchase the first order of safes for sale.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are unable to raise the total funding requested, we may seek angel investment to fill the shortfall. If we are unable to secure angel investment, we will consider applying for grants. We will do whatever is necessary to make this product a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Any contribution is welcome regardless of amount, however, to show our appreciation to our most generous supporters, we will offer the SafeLyfe Alpha at a significant discount to all our backers who pre-order the safe through this campaign.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Beyond making a monetary contribution, you can help us by sharing a link to our campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people know what we are doing, the smoother our product launch will go. We appreciate all your support, both monetary and non-monetary, and we thank you for taking the time to read about what we are doing. Please use the social sharing tools on Indiegogo to share our campaign with your network.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have selected our manufacturing partners carefully for this project, but whenever you are outsourcing work like this, the risk of delay is always real. If any unforeseen logistical challenges arise, we will be sure to keep all our contributors in the loop. We are confident there are no major risks inherent to the next few steps we are taking in this product launch.</p>

By understanding the body’s natural heat map, breathe openings were mapped for optimal airflow, thus keeping the body comfortable and preserving the full benefits of the weighted blanket. 46 to 53 Ventoflo™ Cooling Breathe OpeningsOur twin and queen sizes are each designed with the perfect amount of Ventoflo™ Cooling openings punched through 7 layers of high-quality lining and glass bead filler to keep you properly ventilated and cool all night for your best sleep.     Premium Filler: High-Quality Micro Glass BeadsOur non-toxic, hypoallergenic bead fill provides a consistent weight and smooth texture without the feeling of pebbles in your blanket. No bumps, no lumps, just perfect light and deep pressure.     Reinforced Non-Leak Zigzag Stitching Each Ventoflo™ Cooling opening is reinforced for durability, ensuring accurate bead weight in each section and no leakage.       

 
  For Self-Care | To Help You Reduce Stress And AnxietyThe deep pressure from a Nukkua weighted blanket activates the body’s sensory systems. This creates a calming effect as the brain lowers cortisol (a stress hormone) and increases serotonin and melatonin levels to decrease heart rate and blood pressure.  For Sleep | To Obtain The Ideal Temperature For Optimal SleepThe importance of sleep.


 

 
Deep, restful sleep requires the right ambiance. Optimal temperature plays a big part in your sleep experience—ideally a cool 60-70 ℉. Ventoflo™ Cooling is designed to keep your body ventilated so you can stay at the right temperature longer.    For Well-being | To Protect Your Quality Of Life Getting sufficient quality sleep protects your mental health, physical health, quality of life, and physical safety. Your well-being depends on falling asleep and staying asleep effortlessly each night. With our size and weight options, there is a Nukkua blanket to help you get the quality sleep and relaxation you deserve! Choosing The Right Size BlanketSince everyone's needs are different, we offer the Nukkua weighted blanket in size and weight options. It is recommended that you choose a weighted blanket that is approximately 10% of your body weight for the best results. Coupling The Weighted Blanket With The Duvet Nukkua would like to give our customers choices and options in the way they use our blankets. It is intentional that our duvets are designed without breathing openings so that it provides an alternative use of the weighted blankets. In the warmer months of summer, the single use of the Nukkua weighted blankets with Ventoflo™ Cooling will enable you to keep cool for longer periods whilst enjoying the relaxing benefits of the weighted blanket.In the colder months of winter, you may not want this cooling effect and would prefer to be kept warm and snug. Coupling the weighted blanket and duvet provides this option.   Specifications  • To our Kickstarter backers, thank you for supporting us.

We conduct research, develop concepts, build solutions, and embed technologies to offer a higher level of user experience. We are immensely proud that all of our products are original and designed in-house. As an extended team, we have experience collaborating with makers and innovators from around the world for many years. We have jointly designed and manufactured products for retail as well as crowdfunding in our previous capacities. This includes products in the fields of robotics, sleep monitoring, STEM toys, IoT, smartwatches, e-mobility, weather stations, smart clocks, and industrial products used in smart buildings. We have come together now, under the Kraine umbrella, as a vibrant team brimming with new ideas and passion.  Our Philosophy Sets Us ApartSince our founding in 2018, we have been focusing particularly on sleep solutions, an area in which we feel we build better solutions and truly make a difference. Our sleep solutions brand is Nukkua (pronounced as Nook-Kwah) which means “to sleep” in the Finnish language. Why Focus On Sleep Solutions?Sleep is an important part of health. Over the past years, we have closely supported brands with high growth in weighted blankets. But sleep science is ever evolving, bringing us new solutions for better sleep such as thermoregulation. Nukkua aims to create research-backed products that can reduce stress, alleviate anxiety, and promote better sleep for everyone.The Team As founder and CEO of Nukkua, PP Foo is dedicated to sleep solutions. During his tenure as chairman of Brookstone, PP Foo saw the rise in popularity of the weighted blanket. However, there were many challenges in making weighted blankets comfortable for everyone. The weight causes heat, which can cause sweating; a hot body underneath a thick blanket certainly defeats the purpose of the weighted blankets as encouraging relaxation. Many users had to remove it halfway through their sleep when it got too hot, resulting in sleep disturbance. Foo’s experience leading the acquisition of retail chains and managing labs to generate new product ideas and solutions gave him the idea to solve that problem. He works with an experienced and passionate core team: Joanne Tan as the Chief Marketing Officer and Saner Q as the Chief Designer.  Please email hello@nukkuasleepsuite.com with any questions.",26.0,4,"1 Campaign

​  Business and professional users often demand faster Internet that approaches gigabits, and at the same time run complex devices far beyond that of a simple thermostat.   Our challenge is how to make Firewalla Simple, affordable and Powerful for the future.  Powerful enough to examine packets and detect intrusions at near gigabit speeds. Difference Between Blue and RedSpeed and PowerWhile the Firewalla Red was optimized for affordability, the Blue will be optimized for power and speed. Faster processor and more memory to handle network traffic and attacks at near gigabit speed.  Firewalla Blue will be based on the same software as Firewalla Red. The same software that’s been protecting families across 57 countries around the world.   Both boxes will be using the same App, there is no change.   There will be changes in the cloud to provide more complex security intel for these newer devices. New Software Features on Blue:

VPN Client: Connecting two Firewalla's or connect to your favorite VPN provider.  

Deep scanning: More modules in memory to scan the network. 
Ability to scale to more devices.

Stores more historical data. 

Active Protect Advanced Block List:  More protection by default.
 The Power of GigabitThe Heart of BlueThe Blue will allow all of these wonderful security features to run at near gigabit speeds.  Why near gigabit?  Our current code is able to do 400 to 500 Mbits, and by the time we deliver, we should be closer to gigabit speed.  How Does Firewalla Work?Firewalla’s main packet processing engine has four different stages:

Deep Insight:  Make sense of all network traffic.  Dig deep and understand what they are.

Active Protect:  Intrusion detection services to detect bad things and Intrusion prevention service to block before bad things happen. 

Behavior analytics: See things from a different angle.

Control: This is where you tell us what to do.  Block ads? Block porn? Stop kids from social networks?
 Deep Insight
Where are the flows from?  What country?
What website, or IP address?  
Which device is sending?  
How much traffic?
When was the transfer?
Are they gaming? Watching porn? Or using social networks?
Firewalla provides full visibility to your devices and networks.  Our packet processor will try to make sense out of the flows on the network without invading your privacy.   It can detect activities such as video, gaming, porn, malware and the ability to ""zoom"" all the way to IP addresses.  Some of these features you can only find in professional tools, and they will cost hundreds of dollars. Active ProtectUtilizing deep insight and our unique cloud-based behavior analytics engines, Firewalla can actively detect problems (intrusion detection) and automatically block (intrusion prevention) them if needed once detected.Our unique behavior analytics engine will capture the ""strange"" behaviors to prevent future attacks.  “Who is doing the large upload to this IP address?”  Always in ControlNo longer will you need to pull the power cord from the router, Firewalla gives you full control of your network.  You tell it what to do, and it will do it.  Multiple Firewalla’s on the Same AppWant to be the Chief Information Officer of the family?  Owns a small business? The Firewalla App allows you to manage multiple Firewalla boxes at the same time!  Right at your fingertips. Open & Extensible

<p><i>Dear supporters and followers, today (may 22, 2016) we got this report from Pact, our
partner in Myanmar:</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span><b><span>The distribution of the Solar Home Systems (SHSs) to the community was
accomplished during March 2016.</span></b><br/>A total of 384 people from 50 households in three villages from Budalin
township received the photovoltaic electricity systems through the
hire-purchase system, managed by the Village Development committee, to own
Solar Home Systems (SHSs). Also three community places received the SHSs. By
the end of the project, a total of 596 households (over 3,720 people) gained
access to electricity either through purchasing SHS or benefit from the light
in the community place that the ""Let there be Light"" project had
provided.<span>  Loans valuing $2,230 USD were
provided as community loan to purchase SHSs and about 250 USD were generated
from interest earned which could be used in village development activities. The
“Let There Be Light“ project therefore not only provided electricity in the
villages through photovoltaic solutions, but also provided additional financial
resource for the village development through the interest earned by the Village
Development Funds (VDFs). <br/></span></span></p>

<h3>Short summary</h3>
<br/>Myanmar (Burma)
sits at the intersection of China, India, and the ten ASEAN nations, an area
home to almost half the world’s population and some of its fastest-growing
economies. But despite its neighbors’ successes, Myanmar lags badly behind. Just 26% of Myanmar's population has 
access to the electrical grid, at least half of whom live in cities. In 
rural areas, infrastructure is extremely primitive: <b>of the estimated 
68,000 villages in Myanmar, just 3,000 or so have any sort of access to 
power. </b><br/><br/>We are Rubén<b> </b>Salgado Escudero (Spain, based in Myanmar/freelance photographer <a href=""www.rubensalgado.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.rubensalgado.com</a>) and Karin<b> </b>Hohensinner (Austria/Backoffice).<br/>Rubén knows Myanmar very well and has done a lot of research and photography in rural areas of the country.

Please mention ""Let there be light Myanmar"" when you transfer money so that it goes directly to our project!



Dear supporters and followers, today (may 22, 2016) we got this report from Pact, our
partner in Myanmar:


The distribution of the Solar Home Systems (SHSs) to the community was
accomplished during March 2016.A total of 384 people from 50 households in three villages from Budalin
township received the photovoltaic electricity systems through the
hire-purchase system, managed by the Village Development committee, to own
Solar Home Systems (SHSs). Also three community places received the SHSs. By
the end of the project, a total of 596 households (over 3,720 people) gained
access to electricity either through purchasing SHS or benefit from the light
in the community place that the ""Let there be Light"" project had
provided.  Loans valuing $2,230 USD were
provided as community loan to purchase SHSs and about 250 USD were generated
from interest earned which could be used in village development activities. The
“Let There Be Light“ project therefore not only provided electricity in the
villages through photovoltaic solutions, but also provided additional financial
resource for the village development through the interest earned by the Village
Development Funds (VDFs). 

Short summary
Myanmar (Burma)
sits at the intersection of China, India, and the ten ASEAN nations, an area
home to almost half the world’s population and some of its fastest-growing
economies. But despite its neighbors’ successes, Myanmar lags badly behind. Just 26% of Myanmar's population has 
access to the electrical grid, at least half of whom live in cities. In 
rural areas, infrastructure is extremely primitive: of the estimated 
68,000 villages in Myanmar, just 3,000 or so have any sort of access to 
power. We are Rubén Salgado Escudero (Spain, based in Myanmar/freelance photographer www.rubensalgado.com) and Karin Hohensinner (Austria/Backoffice).Rubén knows Myanmar very well and has done a lot of research and photography in rural areas of the country. After having published 'Solar Portraits Myanmar' Karin read the story behind and was so touched and inspired that she immediately wanted to take action.We are raising funds to purchase and distribute solar light systems for village households across Myanmar's Dry Zone, which is located in the middle part of Myanmar and has some of the 
highest levels of poverty in the country. It is home to 34% of the 
country’s total population. Renewable energy sources mean improving the lives of the rural population effectively - studying, sewing, fishing, cooking, harvesting, or operating a patient after the sun goes down.



With PACT, the longest running NGO in Myanmar (https://www.pactworld.org/country/myanmar), we found a trustworthy partner to help us with distribution, education and sustainability of the project.    Pact's goal is to bring renewable energy access to one million people in Myanmar by 2020 with the project ""Ahlin Yaung ""(""Light""). 
  What we need 

We NEED: Your donation and your support by spreading the word!
Our initial goal is to raise 25,000 USD in
 order to supply high quality solar home lighting systems to 250 family 
households. Any funds going over the initial goal will be used to 
provide solar light to more families in more villages.


The ImpactIn a country where almost all rural labor is still unmechanized, candles
 - which are both expensive and dangerous - are the only source of light
 available once the sun sets. As building the requisite infrastructure 
to connect remote, rural villages to the grid will take a long time, 
solar energy is a viable and much-needed solution that has the potential
 to improve the lives of millions immediately. For only USD 100 you
 can supply one house and family with a solar powered home lighting 
system capable of providing twelve of hours of bright and efficient LED 
lighting per day at no additional cost for the families.

Risks and challenges



We will deliver the products from Taiwan. Campaigns regularly fulfill orders worldwide without any issue, and we
expect this to be the case with our campaign.
The import duty for importing wooden jigsaw puzzles
into United States is 0%. Duty rates, tax rates and tax exemption amounts vary
in different regions.
We don't pretend to have intimate or extensive
Customs knowledge of the entire world. We'll work hard to avoid your package
experiencing problems, but in the end we can't guarantee you won't experience
delays or be charged. As a result, we
will deliver the products as soon as possible.

Splitting Wood directly on the ground entails lots of bending over. This is exactly where we started crafting the GripRock Splitting Block.

We developed the GripRock Splitting Block out of a dire need to make splitting wood with an axe more efficient, safer, and ergonomic.

The GripRock integrated Flex Tire is not any old tire from your local junkyard. We have carefully hand picked, washed, and most importantly, cut off both the metal beads from the inside of the GripRock's Flex Tire.

<p>Hello and thank you for viewing my project. My name is Richard Pierre
 and I am raising funds to mass produce and sell my invention called 
“The Hurricane”. The Hurricane is a new, fast and effective way to clean
 your vehicle’s exterior of snow and ice in immoderate zones. In warmer 
climates, it can be used to clear dust or debris much like a 
leaf-blower. People living in immoderate zones have been affected by 
severely cold winters. Cars were covered with thick layers of snow and 
ice that were not easily removed with ordinary ice scrapers. Large 
amounts of de-icing sprays were required and even then they turned out 
to be unreliable most of the time. The process of getting a vehicle to a
 state that would be considered safe for the roads took close to an 
hour. Many gave up in the process and took their cars to the streets, 
still largely covered with snow; a safety hazard to themselves and 
others. As the saying goes “necessity is the mother of all inventions”, I
 was compelled to come up with a solution to this enormous problem that 
all of us living in immoderate zones must face every winter for months at
 a time.</p>
<br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>How do you battle harsh winters, snow, ice, leaves and debris covering your vehicle?</b></p>
<p><b>With
 The Hurricane of course!</b> The Hurricane is essentially a personal snow 
removal/leaf blower device that can be easily disassembled and stored in
 the trunk of your car. The unit is battery powered and rechargeable 
using the outlet in your vehicle as well as a regular 110 volts wall 
outlet in your home. For snow removal, the Hurricane utilizes a heating 
element in conjunction with a blowing fan, all engineered to fit snugly 
into the handle of the device. This produces a consistent warm flow of 
air at approximately 120 degrees Fahrenheit which effectively melts away
 snow and ice upon contact. The Hurricane’s brush and squeegee sides 
help to further force the snow and ice away from your vehicle’s body and
 windshield without leaving any marks or damage. For leaves/debris 
removal, the Hurricane utilizes a strong blowing motor that can produce 
thrusts of wind with similar force to those produced by conventional 
electric powered leaf blowers. The device’s small size allows for more 
detailed cleaning and keeps your vehicle free of any potential clogging 
that could otherwise have an unwanted effect on the performance of the 
vehicle.</p>
<p>Here are some of the features of The Hurricane:</p>
<p>- Can be operated “hot” or “cold”, i.e. with or without the heating element turned on.</p>
<p>-
 The long lasting and removable Lithium-ion batteries can be recharged 
using the cigarette lighter outlet in your vehicle or by plugging the 
unit into a regular 110-volts wall outlet in your home.</p>
<p>- Quickly heats up to 120 degrees Fahrenheit to melt away snow.</p>
<p> - Air blowing mechanism can produce wind thrusts of up to 230 CFM, equivalent to the conventional electric leaf-blower.</p>
<p>- Easy to re-purpose and use for other appropriate cleaning applications.*</p>
<p>-
 Lightweight and durable, it weighs only three pounds. The unit is 
strong and durable enough to operate as a conventional snow remover even
 without power.</p>
<p>- Comes with a retractable 12 foot long car charging cord that is practical and easy to use.</p>
<p>- Most important of all it works and it won’t leave any scratches on your car.</p>
<p>I
 have already built a working prototype and was very pleased with the 
results. I am convinced that this invention can become the next 
house-hold item that people cannot do without much like the vacuum 
cleaner or the microwave. My plan is to be able to raise enough capital 
to begin manufacturing the final production version of ""The Hurricane"", 
getting the product tested and certified by UL Laboratories, and then 
move the product into the mass market where I am confident the public 
will find its broad and specific uses applicable in their lives. We will
 of course also run a limited production to ship to all our wonderful 
supporters.</p>

<p><strong>Grün leben und denken</strong><br/>Haustainer baut ökologisch, auf grün. Nachhaltigkeit ist uns sehr wichtig. Vom Container zur Dämmung bis zur verwendeten Innenausstattung kann fast alles wiederverwertet werden. Der Einsatz von altbekannten, traditionellen Baumaterialien wie z. B. Holzwolle oder Lehm lassen das Haus natürlich atmen (bestes Raumklima) und helfen die Innenraumtemperatur natürlich zu regeln. Der Einsatz von intelligenten Systemen sorgt für eine optimale Energyeffizienz.</p>
<p><strong>Überall einsetzbar</strong><br/>Haustainer kann fast in jeder Ecke der Welt angeschlossen werden und lässt sich trotzdem noch bewegen. Wenn nötig sogar per Schiff, da unser Container seine Zulassung behält. Auf der Straße, mit der Bahn oder dem Schiff zum nächsten Wohnort - kein Problem. Nur Kleinigkeiten sind zu erledigen bevor man erneut auf die Reise gehen kann - alle Anschlüsse sind nach dem ""plug &amp; play"" ideal gewählt.</p>
<p><strong>Mit Absicht auf kleinerem Fuß leben</strong><br/>Haustainer wirbt mit dem Konzept ""weniger ist mehr"". Haustainer ist ein kleines aber sehr kluges Haus, welches sich zur Aufgabe gemacht hat - Stress für den Eigentümer zu minimieren, weniger Unordnung, einen freien Kopf für die wirklich wichtigen Dinge im Leben! Fast keine Instandsetzungs- oder Reinigungsarbeiten. Haustainer erlaubt dir dein Leben zu führen, wie Du es möchtest.</p>
<p><strong>Innovatives Ingenieurswesen und Architektur</strong><br/>Haustainer ist ein Produkt von intelligentestem Ingenieurwesen. Kein Zentimeter wurde verschenkt. Die Raumaufteilung ist ein Meisterstück der Ingenieur- und Architekturkunst. Von der Eingangstür, zu den multifunktionalen Möbeln, hin zur Vollautomatisierung machen dieses Haus zu einem echten Platz des Wohlfühlen - IHREM ZUHAUSE.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>EIGENSCHAFTEN</strong></h3>

----> DEUTSCH weiter unten!!!----> 1 Dollar = 1,07 EUR----> 1 Dollar = 72 INR
We are in the process of developing a smart HOME, which has the power to change the future living!
Imagine your current rented home/ living space(s):

Is it restricting?
Hate giving away your earnings in rent/ mortgage?
Is making room for kids / old parents a problem?
Have a vacant space that can give you rent?
Still looking for the perfect holiday cabin for the greens?
Have had enough of big, unmanageable spaces?
We have a solution to these problems.

Welcome to the world of HAUSTAINER, where we have designed a home that is ...

easily movable, like a ""tiny-house on wheels""
a smart home at the cost of a car
can still be your home, wherever you go
serves as your cozy nest off the grid
gives you more time to live life by de-cluttering your life


 
Green Living and ThinkingWe at Haustainer believe in living and thinking green. All the materials used in these homes are used sustainably. From container to insulation to components used in interiors close to all can be reused. Use of traditional clay wall plates lets the house breath naturally and maintains the right level of humidity and temperature inside the house. Use of smart features ensures that energy is utilised in an efficient way.
No Barrier of LocationHaustainer can be put in any location of your choice and can be easily moved across continents as it is a home in a shipping container where the basic features of a container are kept intact. It can be moved by road, rail or ship to the place of choice. Almost no disassembling is required as these are independent plug and play units.
Minimal LivingHaustainer promotes the concept of minimal living. Haustainer is a small and simple house which means less stress, clutter free environment, minimal maintanence and more time for things that matter more. Haustainer allows you to live life as you want on your own terms.
Smart Engineering and ArchitectureHaustainer is a product of smart engineering as every cubic inch is designed in such a way that no space is wasted. The room management is the key feature of design and architecture. From front door to multi-functional furniture to use of smart systems everything makes this house a comfortable place to live. 
FEATURES

Affordable, priced under 20.000 Euro
Movable across globe with shipping certification
Environmental friendly (“one-way” containers can be used)
Kitchen with max. 4 standard cabinets
Natural disasters proof (earthquake & hurricane)
Double murphy bed
2 main spaces (private / public, sound & view proof)
Enlargeable bathroom (standard shower & flushing toilet)
Extreme conditions proof (comfort range -15°C up to 50°C)
Fully automated (smart home ready)
everything IN & OUT through the main entry

WHAT WE HAVE
We have a space to put our prototype. It is our base near Hanover in Wennigsen. We have completed the conception, design, layout and engineering phase. Now we are ready to procure the container and start building. We have a small team of young talent and we are in the process of expanding our team. We are currently working with a lot of consultants, engineers and freelancers who are experts in different genres of construction and building.

Haustainer is a venture of ""Mahi homes"", founded by the name of our daughter, which is also the combination of first two letters of our names.
 
WHAT WE NEED
Sufficient support for finishing the prototype. We need funds to turn our ideas into reality and construct the first Haustainer and test its viability.
Haustainer is more than just putting a house inside a container. It is about smart engineering and design, optimum use of space without compromising on basic features needed for comfortable living and building a product that can be afforded by all.
Our dream is to make Haustainer available to everyone, everywhere. We need Funds to start our prototype in May. We are already through with the design and engineering phase. Apart from funds we need:


Your Support by sharing our campaign with your friends, colleagues & spreading our idea if you find our idea interesting and worth sharing.

SPONSORS or Partners who think their product is best suited to be a part of Haustainer.

Mentors who are advising and giving us constructive feedback.
Construction Partners who are helping us turn a dream into reality.

Investors who believe that our idea has the potential to change the current way of living.

HAUSTAINER
Wir entwickeln ein ZUHAUSE, welches unser zukünftiges Wohnen verändern kann!
Klein, intelligent, nachhaltig und mehr als nur einfach zu bewegen.

Schränkt dich dein Haus manchmal ein?
Hasst du es Miete oder ein Darlehen abzuzahlen?
Ist zusätzlicher Raum für die Kinder oder Großeltern ein Problem?
Wie sieht es aus mit zusätzlichen Mieteinnahmen?
Du träumst von einem Ferienhaus?
Spürst du manchmal, dass dich die Größe nicht mehr glücklich macht?

Wir haben eine Lösung zu all diesen Problemen.HAUSTAINER ist ...

einfacher zu transportieren als eine Gartenlaube!
ein intelligentes Haus zum Preis von einem Auto!
immer an deiner Seite, wenn du es brauchst!
dient dir auch in der Wildnes!
bringt dich zurück zum ""dein Leben leben""!


 
Grün leben und denkenHaustainer baut ökologisch, auf grün. Nachhaltigkeit ist uns sehr wichtig. Vom Container zur Dämmung bis zur verwendeten Innenausstattung kann fast alles wiederverwertet werden. Der Einsatz von altbekannten, traditionellen Baumaterialien wie z. B. Holzwolle oder Lehm lassen das Haus natürlich atmen (bestes Raumklima) und helfen die Innenraumtemperatur natürlich zu regeln. Der Einsatz von intelligenten Systemen sorgt für eine optimale Energyeffizienz.
Überall einsetzbarHaustainer kann fast in jeder Ecke der Welt angeschlossen werden und lässt sich trotzdem noch bewegen. Wenn nötig sogar per Schiff, da unser Container seine Zulassung behält. Auf der Straße, mit der Bahn oder dem Schiff zum nächsten Wohnort - kein Problem. Nur Kleinigkeiten sind zu erledigen bevor man erneut auf die Reise gehen kann - alle Anschlüsse sind nach dem ""plug & play"" ideal gewählt.
Mit Absicht auf kleinerem Fuß lebenHaustainer wirbt mit dem Konzept ""weniger ist mehr"". Haustainer ist ein kleines aber sehr kluges Haus, welches sich zur Aufgabe gemacht hat - Stress für den Eigentümer zu minimieren, weniger Unordnung, einen freien Kopf für die wirklich wichtigen Dinge im Leben! Fast keine Instandsetzungs- oder Reinigungsarbeiten. Haustainer erlaubt dir dein Leben zu führen, wie Du es möchtest.
Innovatives Ingenieurswesen und ArchitekturHaustainer ist ein Produkt von intelligentestem Ingenieurwesen. Kein Zentimeter wurde verschenkt. Die Raumaufteilung ist ein Meisterstück der Ingenieur- und Architekturkunst. Von der Eingangstür, zu den multifunktionalen Möbeln, hin zur Vollautomatisierung machen dieses Haus zu einem echten Platz des Wohlfühlen - IHREM ZUHAUSE.
 
EIGENSCHAFTEN

bezahlbar mit dem Ziel, ein Haus unter 20.000 Euro zu bekommen
LKW transportierbar, aber eben auch per Schiff (Standard Container)
umweltfreundlich (1x benutzte Container sind in großer Stückzahl vorhanden)
Küche mit 4 üblichen Einheiten
katastrophensicher gegen Erdbeben oder Sturmschäden
Doppelbett (welches sich in die Wand klappen lässt)
2 Zimmer (privat & öffentlich)
Zauberbadezimmer mit Standarddusche & Toilette
Komfortbereich reicht von -15° im Winter bis hoch zu 50° im Sommer
voll automatisiert (Smartphone steuerbar)
alle Anschlüsse gehen vorne rein & raus

 
entwickelt für Temperaturen bis 50° im Sommer 
....... oder -15° im Winter mit viel Schnee! 
Haustainer ist die pure FLEXIBILITÄT, wenn man es denn möchte. 
Innenstädte, die nächste Phase von Haustainer

<h3>What <i>At Home with Andrea </i>is All About</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Andrea. I am a teacher, artist, and friend.</p>
<p><strong>When I was a kid,</strong> I made a killing in allowance because I was the helper of our house. I learned from a young age just how wonderful it felt to spend an entire Saturday cleaning and organizing my room and laying back to take in the atmosphere. Was I a nerd? Absolutely. But that desire for a harmonious living space stuck with me, and now I am ready to put it to work.</p>
<p><strong>My first business</strong> was a lemonade stand. I was 8 and in Southern Florida. Even then, I was able to analyze my market and provide a tasty solution--people were thirsty in the 90 degree heat. I marketed by riding my bike around the neighborhood yelling ""Ice cold lemonade on 45th Street!"" . I had product quality measures--every drop had the perfect ratio of  Country Time powder and filtered water. I even hired an employee! She quit when I wouldn't give her 50% or gross earnings, but I knew even then that that wasn't an appropriate rate for a cashier. I made about $15 dollars, largely in change from my peers and a couple of sweaty dads who  just finished yard work. I was rich! I put $10 in my piggy bank, and kept $5 in my wallet for miscellaneous candy items.</p>
<p><strong>In my adult life,</strong> I have kept a ""real"" job and put myself through school. I received my Teaching Certificate in English and Spanish in 2011 and have spent the last 6 years in education. I absolutely love helping children and adults to reach their goals. However, that entrepreneurial itch never left. I am ready now to see where it can take me.</p>
<p><strong>At Home with Andrea is my solution to:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Owning my own small business</li>
<li>Using my creative talents to beautify and increase aesthetic</li>
<li>Providing healthy meal solutions for busy families (I love to cook!)</li>
<li>Building my relationships within my community</li>
<li> Maintaining my freedom to teach, in a 1-on-1 setting</li>
<li>Increasing giving by offering a 10% discount on ""Pay it Forward"" services-- pre-paid services gifted to someone familiar, or a neighbor in need</li>
</ol> <p><strong>Every contribution to this campaign will go directly to supporting the start up of At Home with Andrea. </strong>From cleaning supplies, interior design reference books, on-the-go kitchen tools, uniforms, etc., your contribution - of any size - will make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Give &amp; Receive</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $5,000 for the startup costs. Each gift of $30 or more receives a service. See the perks section for more information. These perks make your gift less like a handout and more like a pre-paid service!</p>
<p><strong>Startup costs include:</strong></p>

<li>Cleaning supplies and tools</li>
<li>Website, Marketing, and Accounting tools</li>

<p>I plan on beginning my startup marketing campaign with discounts on services rendered within the first 3 months.

<p>1. <strong>eKEY</strong> - Delivery person automatically receives an eKEY with every order to open locked eBOX’s. Sensors let eKEY know if there’s anything inside and eBOX’s automatically expand, close, and lock packages securely.</p> <p>2. <strong>Alarm System</strong> – eBOX’s are alarmed and will send immediate notifications to the user if they’re tampered with. For eTETHR®, flashing lights and adjustable audible alarm alerts neighbors and scares off intimidated thieves, while capturing their cell phone I.D. and activating the 2-way communication system. Alerts are automatically sent to the authorized user.</p> <p>3. <strong>High Def Night Vision Camera</strong> - An oldie but a goodie. We use high quality camera technology with our 2-way audio Communication System and instant recordings to the cloud of your choice to catch thieves in the act. Also great for knowing the instant your package arrives and monitoring your front door (or wherever our devices are installed).</p> <p>4. <strong>Interior Biometric Control Locking System</strong> - Have multiple people receiving packages in your home, apartment, or business? Make sure only the intended person has access to prescription medications, alcohol, and sensitive materials by controlling “who” receives an intended delivery. Available on any eBOX®.</p> <p>5. <strong>Wireless Lithium-Ion Battery Power System</strong> - Nothing to plug in. Nothing to charge. Don’t even worry about power outages. Our specially designed inductive Lithium-Ion battery system will work 24/7 365 days a year. For all our eDOR® &amp; eBOX® devices.</p> <p>6. <strong>Temperature Controlled Hot &amp; Cold eBOX® Upgrade</strong> - Receiving medications or groceries in extreme weather conditions or just want them fresh and at their optimum temperature until you can be there to receive them? Don’t sweat not being at your home or office to receive temperature sensitive items! Coming soon!</p> <p>7. <strong>Mobile App Connection</strong> - Wi-Fi connectivity’s automatic with Bluetooth as a backup in case it’s not available, so you’ll always be connected. If your alarm’s triggered, we can set you up to be connected to emergency services. Our standard App comes with a free download with the option to add-on additional security functions and operate and communicate with your eDOR® System from anywhere in the world.</p> <p>8. <strong>Exact GPS Coordinates</strong> - Do you live in a remote location, or in a 20-story high-rise? We’ve got you covered with built in GPS technology to locate your designated delivery spot. Automatically gives the exact location of any of our devices (even if it’s on the side or back of your property), so there’s no chance of a missed or delayed delivery.</p>

Are you tired of missed package sticky notes, package thieves, and groceries left out in the hot sun or rain?
According to one industry estimate, 31% of consumers have been victims.
We have the solution.

""It eliminates the entire possibility of package theft or missed deliveries, by putting the package in a secure environment where it is easy and convenient for the consumer to retrieve"".

Strategic Innovations, LLC is a Consumer Products Development Company with quantum leap inventions that solve global issues and problems. The eDOR®, eBOX® and eTETHR® devices are U.S. and International patent pending products.

No package delivery solution has been as complete as the eDOR® system. We offer viable solutions at the highest level. They’re not just functional; we integrate that wow factor into our simple package delivery solutions. You can expect revolutionary technology delivered to your doorstep.


1. eKEY - Delivery person automatically receives an eKEY with every order to open locked eBOX’s. Sensors let eKEY know if there’s anything inside and eBOX’s automatically expand, close, and lock packages securely. 2. Alarm System – eBOX’s are alarmed and will send immediate notifications to the user if they’re tampered with. For eTETHR®, flashing lights and adjustable audible alarm alerts neighbors and scares off intimidated thieves, while capturing their cell phone I.D. and activating the 2-way communication system. Alerts are automatically sent to the authorized user. 3. High Def Night Vision Camera - An oldie but a goodie. We use high quality camera technology with our 2-way audio Communication System and instant recordings to the cloud of your choice to catch thieves in the act. Also great for knowing the instant your package arrives and monitoring your front door (or wherever our devices are installed). 4. Interior Biometric Control Locking System - Have multiple people receiving packages in your home, apartment, or business? Make sure only the intended person has access to prescription medications, alcohol, and sensitive materials by controlling “who” receives an intended delivery. Available on any eBOX®. 5. Wireless Lithium-Ion Battery Power System - Nothing to plug in. Nothing to charge. Don’t even worry about power outages. Our specially designed inductive Lithium-Ion battery system will work 24/7 365 days a year. For all our eDOR® & eBOX® devices. 6. Temperature Controlled Hot & Cold eBOX® Upgrade - Receiving medications or groceries in extreme weather conditions or just want them fresh and at their optimum temperature until you can be there to receive them? Don’t sweat not being at your home or office to receive temperature sensitive items! Coming soon! 7. Mobile App Connection - Wi-Fi connectivity’s automatic with Bluetooth as a backup in case it’s not available, so you’ll always be connected. If your alarm’s triggered, we can set you up to be connected to emergency services. Our standard App comes with a free download with the option to add-on additional security functions and operate and communicate with your eDOR® System from anywhere in the world. 8. Exact GPS Coordinates - Do you live in a remote location, or in a 20-story high-rise? We’ve got you covered with built in GPS technology to locate your designated delivery spot. Automatically gives the exact location of any of our devices (even if it’s on the side or back of your property), so there’s no chance of a missed or delayed delivery.

Whether you rent or own, you can easily replace your existing door on your own or with the help of a handyman or authorized installer. Most doors fit into a standard door frame and can easily be changed out.  If you rent or lease your home or office, make sure to keep the old door and replace it when you move.

In addition to safe and secure packages being delivered conveniently to your home and office, a bonus benefit is the worry-free peace of mind you’ll experience. We understand that some packages are irreplaceable or need special care. We also understand the enormous hassle and anxiety of having to change your schedule in order to accommodate deliveries, and wanting more things to be delivered if there was an easy and hassle-free way to do that.

 

Our Systems are designed for all types of residential, multi-family, and commercial applications. We are partnering with Industry leading door manufacturers and have many materials to match your building requirements and styles.

We realize that we’re technology innovation leaders and not door manufacturing experts. That’s why through our stratgetic manufacturing partnerships we’re bringing you the latest trends and styles with our intergrated technology and cutting edge systems designed into them to deliver the best of all worlds, that solve problems and create a seamless experience as never before.


The problem of missing, unsecured, and stolen packages has created a huge market for solutions. Some are very simple but not convenient or practical. None of these solutions are as complete, customizable, and advanced as our suite of solutions that the eDOR® System offers.

The eDOR® System offers a suite of secure solutions to both owners and renters of residential and commercial properties in a variety of stylish colors, materials, systems and designs that are Industry 1st products that nobody else has ever thought of or invented.


Most packages received will fit inside our eBOX®’s. For the few times you do receive bulky or large items, we created the eTETHR® which can be used on its own or with the eDOR® or eBOX® system.

Yes, we want to be very transparent and customization does cost extra. We have many options to fit every budget in the areas of style, materials, colors, security, technology, and more. Our standard options fit the majority of our consumers. We also offer the option of customization whereas many of our competitors only offer one mass market model. We are a truly modular solution. Whether you are renting or own your space, we have secure options for your needs.


eDOR®, eBOX® and eTETHR® are US & International patent pending inventions by Strategic Innovations, LLC, a Consumer Products Development Company. The eDOR® suite of products solves a multitude of problems that are inherent in the everyday process of package and product delivery and pick-up from homes and businesses throughout the world today. eDOR® combines cutting-edge technology with applied science and revolutionary design to deliver a bonafide and well thought out system that enables it's users, as well as the delivery and eCommerce industry, to enjoy immense freedom and control of receiving and delivering packages, products, and items as never before.
eDOR® allows for 24/7 pick-up and deliveries to be made at your home or office, all without ever having to interact with the delivery person in any way, without you being there, and with complete security, track-ability, notifications and control given to you anywhere in the world. There's so much more!


Our Systems Are Modular and May Have Multiple eBOX's, or Just a Single eBOX® if that’s what's preferred. Our eBOX's are designed for both OEM (original equipment manufacturer), to be utilized by our door manufacturer, as well as off-the-shelf to be purchased online and at key brick and mortar outlets in various shapes and sizes that can be retrofitted into a wide variety of property scenarios.

Our built-in and Stand-alone eTETHR® Device provides security and connectivity as nothing else ever invented or on the market.
Our eTETHR® device is designed for any eDOR® or eBOX® and can also be a Stand-alone product with a 2-way Communication upgrade that can be installed anywhere; literally any type of residential or commercial setting or application. This is also a great option for anyone who rents or leases a property and doesn't want to install an eDOR® or eBOX®.


Each eDOR® has an upgradable 2-way Communication and smart Door Locking System and can be outfitted with multiple eBOX®’s. Each one can serve a different purpose. You can store dry cleaning, packages, and virtually any item. The eBOX® opens with an eKEY, they are automatically sent as a one-time unlocking method on electronic devices like cell phones to whoever’s making a delivery to any of our devices. Anytime an order is sent out and they have an eDOR® or eBOX® then it automatically has an eKEY along with exact GPS location.
 When the eKEY is within range of the designated eDOR® or eBOX® it automatically senses it though NFC technology and unlocks the exterior compartment, which when once opened, then expands to accept and protect the delivery. After it's closed it can only be opened from inside. The authorized user can manually re-open any eBOX® remotely from our App in case a mistake was made by the delivery person. Every eBOX® has interior sensors for safety and security that check to make sure there’s nothing inside once a delivery’s removed and then it automatically closes back to its nesting position. We also have high-security eBOX®’s for sensitive and controlled items like prescriptions drugs and medications, liquor, high value items, etc. These include Biometric fingerprint scanners that control “who” receives a delivery. Our Biometric scanners can be put on any type or style of eBOX® (at the factory).
If an item is too big to fit in an eDOR® or eBOX® it can be attached to an eTETHR®.


 




 
Our entire eDOR®, eBOX® and eTETHR® product line has full U.S. and International Patents (pending). We’re very pleased to announce that Arrow Electronics, the Industry Leading $26+ billion a year Company, has certified our eDOR® Invention! Arrow only Certifies smart IoT products that go through their rigorous electronics design and schematic review process and that they believe have a high probability of being manufactured and working as designed.
Our products have been lauded by the media as “The Solution” to eCommerce! Check out our Home and News Pages on our website for many examples www.eDORdelivery.com

Creating the potential for subsidized purchasing whereby major industry partners can come alongside and offer our products as part of their loyalty programs is another mission; such as Amazon Prime Members being able to get an eTETHR® device for $5 per month, or an eBOX® installed for $10 per month, as examples.
This lowers the barrier to entry while serving all parties in ways that few could imagine.
Our eDOR®, eBOX® & eTETHR® products deliver a secure and well thought out system that enables it's users, as well as the delivery and eCommerce industry's, to enjoy immense freedom and control of receiving and delivering packages, products, and items as never before.

We're ready to blast-off and deliver and your contribution and support will allow us to do just that!
Our prototypes are fully engineered and operational and we need to raise $50,000 to manufacture our eDOR®, eBOX®, and eTETHR® products and bring them to market. We're also seeking industry support and manufacturing partners and are currently in talks with several industry leaders.
This project and campaign can make a serious contribution to the world by solving issues and problems on a global scale that's never been accomplished, and in a multi-trillion dollar industry that reaches every part of the world. Furthermore, our goal and mission is to not only help industry and consumers alike, it's to create long-term solutions for the United States Postal Service through the ""subscriber option"" in our systems to produce revenue and traction that give us all the ability to be part of something really amazing and something that's truly a higher good where everyone wins by adopting and utilizing our systems.
 Our fully engineered and functioning prototypes give demonstrative evidence that our systems work and deliver as promised. As we go through the Value Engineering process of manufacturing we'll no doubt create much sleeker and sexier versions to appeal to the masses while continuing to profile the many applications that our designs are created to serve.
We've minimized the risks of this project by utilizing top-of-the-line engineering and following industry standards and adopting known technologies, all the while creating highly valued intellectual property rights via our U.S. and International patent filings, registered trademarks, and industry relationships that we're confident will all become part of our secret sauce.

<h3>As a career Police Officer, I have responded to most major recent hurricanes to strike the United States, from Hurricanes Katrina in 2005 to Hurricane Florence, last month. I served and led teams in emergency search and rescue, damage assessment and humanitarian relief capacities, where I witnessed first-hand the loss of life and extreme hardship that occurs in the aftermath of a hurricane.</h3>

<p>In each of these hurricanes, similar patterns became evident to me. First, hurricane devastation results in days to weeks of 19th Century-like conditions, with loss of electrical power, water, sewer service, cellular service, groceries or fuel. These impacts impact people across all socio-economic boundaries. Secondly, very few people are prepared. Whether they are life-long residents or new to hurricane zones and regardless of income, most people who shelter in place during hurricanes fail to take the necessary steps to prepare. Finally, the ability of the government, utility companies and businesses to restore essential services.</p>
<p>My mission is to solve this problem with Ready2Stay™️.  For families who are members of our service and cannot evacuate ahead of a forecasted hurricane, Ready2Stay will provide members with continuous information concerning the hurricane forecast for their area, as well as specific evacuation notices and instructions. In addition, if members elect to shelter in place, Ready2Stay will ship them the necessary food, supplies and equipment to sustain a family of four, for five days. There are no worries of impossible lines or a run on food and supplies when it's needed most.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I am a first-time entrepreneur. I see a tremendous need for a truly effective hurricane preparedness service and have developed a unique solution through Ready2Stay. I recognize that most businesses fail and that I don't have all the answers. However, I have surrounded myself with highly successful entrepreneurs that continue to guide and mentor me.</p>
<p>My years as a Police Lieutenant, attorney, former Chief of Staff of Chicago Cook County’s Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, as well as my service as a Marine and Army Paratrooper have prepared me for this next step.</p>
<p>A great deal of work has gone into laying the groundwork for the launch of Ready2Stay. From an analysis of the marketplace, forecasting models, logistics capabilities and digital marketing, we are well positioned to launch Ready2Stay and begin making a difference in the millions of lives affected by hurricanes each year.</p>

From an analysis of the marketplace, forecasting models, logistics capabilities and digital marketing, we are well positioned to launch Ready2Stay and begin making a difference in the millions of lives affected by hurricanes each year.
Please support me in this effort.
Thank you.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Hello, my name is Bin Xu</strong></h3>
<p>I am Product Designer and Interior Architect. I have been educated at the Rietveld Academy in the Netherlands and live and work in Amsterdam. I love to travel and nature fascinates me a lot. I get piece of mind being surrounded by nature. The natural space is often inspirational to me. Time becomes irrelevant. A continuous flow in nature. The elements of wood, light, fire, stone, water and air. They live together and respond to each other.  They addept and change each other to maintain a certain balance.  A balance we people also need but is increasingly avoided by hectic livestyles. See the Rising Balance candleholder perhaps also as a symbol for improved personal balance and relaxation. Just take 30-60 minutes to relax and watch the movement.</p>
<h3>Your support for production</h3>
<p>With your help and support we can further develop the Rising Balance candleholder and prepare for production on a larger scale.</p>
<h3>Your support for distribution</h3>
<p>The funds from this campaign will be used to develop a new production method and create a distribution network.</p>
<p>So if you buy one or more candle holders we say thank you very much for your support to produce the Rising Balance candleholder and we will work very hard to deliver on time and keep you informed on new developments and give you the first options to buy new products at best price.</p>
<p>If we reach the $30.000 goal, we will use the funds as follows:</p>
<p>- product development and new production method for large scale production</p>
<p>- travel to production facilities and making sure we deliver best quality and products shipped in time to you.</p>
<p>- setting up a website, marketing and distribution network</p>
<p>If we don't reach the full amount it will depend on the number of Rising Balance candleholders sold wether we can deliver the product for the price mentioned in this campaign. The minimum number of Rising Balance candleholders to be sold in this campaign in order do so is 600 pieces. </p>
<h3>Your support to spread the word</h3>
<p>We need your contribution and support to reach this goal. If you like the product, please inform your friends and family via the Indiegogo links about the Rising Balance candleholder and help us to make it happen.</p>
<p>We already have the production facilities selected and tested and we are confident we will deliver your Rising Balance candleholder before april 2018.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;text-align:left !important;""><strong>How did you manage to pack all these features into a single system?</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;text-align:left !important;"">We’ve spent the last 5 years developing and successfully delivering market disrupting products. We’ve been integrating smarthome hubs with our WiFi router since 2013 and we’ve spent the last 2 years fine tuning our system specifically for home security features. Almond Guard is the culmination of all these years of R&amp;D.</p>
<p>We're proud of what we’ve come up with, and we think you will love it.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>How do I arm/disarm the system?</strong></p>
<p>You can set the system to arm/disarm automatically based on your smartphone's WiFi or GPS. You can also arm/disarm the system from the mobile app or using the touchscreen LCD.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>What are these arm/disarm locations?</strong></p>
<p>Almond Guard is bringing you the ability to Arm/Disarm by zones, which is typically only available in very expensive high-end systems. This lets you arm only parts of your home depending on your needs. For example during nights, you can just arm the outside doors and leave the sensors inside the home disarmed. Another example is when your family is hanging out in the backyard during the weekend you can just arm everything except the backyard.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>When will the siren sound?</strong></p>
<p>Siren(s) will sound whenever sensors in the armed locations are triggered or tampered with. You can also choose to disable the siren for certain sensors if you want them to silently report to you (and the Central Monitoring Station, if you choose). Example: let’s say you want to silently monitor a specific drawer with valuables, but don’t want opening it to trigger the siren.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>What is pro-monitoring? What is included in the $10/month fees?</strong></p>
<p>We work with leading UL listed emergency response service providers to make sure you get professional help in case of an emergency at home.</p>
<p>24x7 Emergency response and cellular backup are both included in the $10/mo subscription.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>What is a Central Monitoring Station (CMS)</strong></p>
<p>A Central Monitoring Station is an Underwriters Laboratory (UL) certified facility, made up of a team of experienced professionals trained to handle home security. They monitor alerts and dispatch emergency response as needed.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>How does pro-monitoring work?</strong></p>
<p>Professional monitoring has many checks and balances to make sure that action is taken in case of an emergency and no action is taken in case of a false alarm.<br/><br/>In Brief -</p>
<ul style=""text-align: left;padding:0 0 0 18px;"">

<li style=""margin-bottom:15px;"">If you don’t respond, they will report the event to the local emergency service(s) to dispatch emergency response to your home.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>Can I add more sensors &amp; smart home devices? How do I buy more?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can add upto 100 smart home devices and sensors to a single system. Securifi will sell some of the key sensors like door sensors, motion detectors etc. on our website. You can find the list of all the compatible sensors here.<br/><a href=""https://www.securifi.com/sensors"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.securifi.com/sensors</a></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>How many WiFi &amp; Network devices can the Almond Guard’s Mesh WiFi system handle?</strong></p>
<p>On top of the smart home devices and sensors, you can also have up to 100 network (WiFi and wired) devices as part of Almond Guard system.<br/>Note that with some devices like Nest, you have to count them both as smart home device and a WiFi device.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>What smart sensors and devices are compatible with  Almond Guard?</strong></p>
<p>Besides Securifi’s own sensors, it's compatible with 100s of 3rd party products. You can access a list of compatible products here.<br/><a href=""https://www.securifi.com/sensors"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.securifi.com/sensors</a></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>What cameras are compatible with Almond Guard?</strong></p>
<p>At the time of delivery, the Almond motion camera will be supported. Integration with Nest Cam will be added soon after that. We also have plans to support more cameras in our roadmap.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>Do I need to install a Camera?</strong></p>
<p>Our system works with just the sensors (door, motion, etc..) even if you don’t install cameras. But we recommend cameras as they enhance the overall security of your system.<br/><br/>Please note that in certain counties and cities, local laws require that all alarm signals are verified by video evidence before a Central Monitoring Station (CMS) calls emergency response. Such laws exist to prevent false alarms. Please check your local rules.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>When does a Central Monitoring Station (CMS) have access to my video feed?</strong></p>
<p>First, only the cameras you designate will be able to be accessed by the CMS. Secondly, a CMS can only access the video feed when an alarm is triggered. At that point they verify the video evidence to make sure that a real emergency has taken place before dispatching emergency response.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>How does the Almond motion camera work?</strong></p>
<p>Almond motion cameras are battery powered and start recording as soon as motion is detected. They’re designed with privacy in mind with only a low resolution of 640x480 pixels. That resolution is just enough to figure out whether a real intrusion has taken place.<br/><br/>The video clip can also be used by the Central Monitoring Station (CMS) to to ascertain that an alarm is real and not a false alarm caused by pets or balloons or other such events.<br/><br/>Since they’re battery powered, you have more flexibility in terms of their placement.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>Is Pro-Monitoring available outside the US?</strong></p>
<p>We currently offer pro-monitoring only in the US. But you can self monitor your home for free wherever you are. Since Almond Guard has a built-in cellular capability, you can also add a local sim card to enable cellular backup.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>Can I access video feeds through cellular backup?</strong></p>
<p>With the $10 /mo service provided by Securifi, only alarm monitoring events are sent through the cellular backup service. Your Almond 3S hub needs a wired or WiFi internet connection to send the video data to our cloud. As a future update, we will provide users with the ability to purchase additional cellular data to transmit video and other Internet traffic also through your cellular connection.<br/><br/>If users install their own SIM card in the Almond 3S, they’ll have the ability to select whether to send only the Alarm data or all Internet data through that cellular connection.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>What is the difference between the $6/mo service and the free service?</strong></p>
<p>For our customers in the US who only wish to self monitor their home, the $6/month service provides cellular backup in case of loss of broadband internet. As explained in the previous question, this cellular connection only covers your alarm signal information and not the entire internet traffic of your system. We handle the provisioning of the SIMs and management of this service so that you don’t have to deal with the telecom</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>Do you have warranty?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we provide a 2 year hardware warranty.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>Do you alert fire services?</strong></p>
<p>Not at this time. Carbon monoxide and smoke detectors have to be monitored by the users themselves. The platform still supports them which means you can setup notifications and alerts but due to different regulations for different devices, we don’t send these monitoring signals to the Central Monitoring Stations.</p>
<p>However, this could change in the future as we're looking into ways to bring such a service also in an affordable manner.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>Can I connect my existing Almond to Almond Guard?</strong></p>
<p>You can connect your existing Almond and use it as a Range Extender or an Access Point. If you have an Almond 3, it can be used to enhance the Mesh Wi-Fi with the Almond 3S hub shipped as part of the Almond Guard system.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>How long do the sensor batteries last?</strong></p>
<p>Below are the battery life figures based on typical usage:<br/>Door Sensor: 2-3 years<br/>Motion Detector: 2-3 years<br/>Almond Click: 2 years<br/>Flood Sensor: 2 years</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>Is the kit available in other colors?</strong></p>
<p>No, Almond 3S and the sensors are only available in white.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>What kind of Security do you use in your devices and apps?</strong></p>
<p>We use bank grade encryption to transmit information between the Almond hub, our cloud and the Almond mobile apps. We also perform security audits of our architecture periodically. Lastly, when security issues were brought to our attention in the past, we have a history of providing timely firmware upgrades addressing such security issues.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom:0px;""><strong>Who should I reach out to in case I have any issues?</strong></p>

<p>In recent years, affordable and resistant housing has become a growing problem in Puerto Rico. Economic and environmental factors have generated a housing crisis where resistant and accessible housing is scarce. With almost half of the population registered below the poverty level, formal construction of a concrete and wood house is out of budget for the most. Leaving most in unstable and insecure living conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>55% of housing in PR was found to be informally constructed </li>
<li>Of that 45% that was formally constructed, 98% suffered little to no damage after Hurricane María </li>
<li>Hurricane María caused the destruction of more than over 70,000 houses in Puerto Rico </li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left:0.5in;text-align: right;""><i>ACPR: Foro Estudio de Vivienda: Proyecciones y Realidades, 2018.</i></p>

<h3><strong>About HiveCube: </strong></h3>
<p>Hurricane Maria has been the largest catastrophic event affecting Puerto Rico in recent history. The resiliency of the people and the desire to revisit and transform their outlook on life was the spark for our new concept. An idea that takes into account safety, pricing and comfort for middle-class families that, more than a house, need a home to re-start their lives after all the destruction hurricane María brought.</p>
<p>Our project envisions a modular concept that is utilitarian, expandable and adjusts to each client’s needs. Traditional housing in the Island is expensive, limited by geography and designed with the ideas of a previous century that are not necessarily considering the lifestyle and taste of a younger generation.</p>
<p>Built with all code specifications and guaranteed approval we propose an economic solution that can be built fast and, most importantly, right for the community and the environment. This revolutionary concept will help revitalize the local economy and provide more than an option; a solution in the local market.</p>
<p>Sustainable development, economic vitality, security &amp; environmental integrity is the basis of HiveCube. We are a team of forward thinkers that will change the landscape of our country with our commitment to quality, excellence and value deliverables that will improve and enhance the lives of many.</p>
<p>HiveCube believes that security should not be a matter of income. That is why we have created our Basic Model Unit to help those in need of affordable and secure housing in Puerto Rico. The idea is to create a prefabrication system where we will be able to construct houses in less than three months and give our community the option of a house that is available to anyone. </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Problem:
www.hivecubepr.com
In recent years, affordable and resistant housing has become a growing problem in Puerto Rico. Economic and environmental factors have generated a housing crisis where resistant and accessible housing is scarce. With almost half of the population registered below the poverty level, formal construction of a concrete and wood house is out of budget for the most. Leaving most in unstable and insecure living conditions:

55% of housing in PR was found to be informally constructed 
Of that 45% that was formally constructed, 98% suffered little to no damage after Hurricane María 
Hurricane María caused the destruction of more than over 70,000 houses in Puerto Rico 

ACPR: Foro Estudio de Vivienda: Proyecciones y Realidades, 2018.
 
Additionally, secure and affordable housing is readily available for most living in the island:
 

About HiveCube: 
Hurricane Maria has been the largest catastrophic event affecting Puerto Rico in recent history. The resiliency of the people and the desire to revisit and transform their outlook on life was the spark for our new concept. An idea that takes into account safety, pricing and comfort for middle-class families that, more than a house, need a home to re-start their lives after all the destruction hurricane María brought.
Our project envisions a modular concept that is utilitarian, expandable and adjusts to each client’s needs. Traditional housing in the Island is expensive, limited by geography and designed with the ideas of a previous century that are not necessarily considering the lifestyle and taste of a younger generation.
Built with all code specifications and guaranteed approval we propose an economic solution that can be built fast and, most importantly, right for the community and the environment. This revolutionary concept will help revitalize the local economy and provide more than an option; a solution in the local market.
Sustainable development, economic vitality, security & environmental integrity is the basis of HiveCube. We are a team of forward thinkers that will change the landscape of our country with our commitment to quality, excellence and value deliverables that will improve and enhance the lives of many.
HiveCube believes that security should not be a matter of income. That is why we have created our Basic Model Unit to help those in need of affordable and secure housing in Puerto Rico. The idea is to create a prefabrication system where we will be able to construct houses in less than three months and give our community the option of a house that is available to anyone. 
 

 
 

What we need: 
As of right now, HiveCube is working building its prototype and achieve funding to establish its prefabrication factory in PR.  We are focusing our initial sales efforts on projects that have a direct link to the benefit of our Puerto Rican community through organizations. 
Working alongside with Parallel 18, in their Pre-18 Startup Program, our goal is to be able to complete a fully sustainable, off-the-grid prototype by mid-June. This will allow us to further continue to raise funding for the construction of our HiveCube factory that will allow us to design and create our model unit and help families that have lost their homes;  while also creating jobs. 
Funding through this campaign will go directly to the construction of the prototype and establishment of the HiveCube Factory. 
Your contributions will go towards to: 

5k Completion of Off-Grid Prototype Home
74k Manufacturing of first two homes for families in Loiza, Puerto Rico displaced after Hurricane María: in partnership with Taller Salud (www.tallersalud.com) 
21k Job Creation through the Establishment of Manufacturing Facility

<p>We at QwikFix appreciate your taking the time to review our campaign. I had been in the financial services industry for over 25 years but have given it up to pursue building QwikFix. I have put everything into this, from money to time to sweat and tears because I know it will succeed enormously.</p>
<p>Having been a ""do it yourself"" guy for my entire life, I know the frustration and difficulty in getting the smaller jobs and tasks done around the home. Even if you have the skills, you don't have the time or right tool or desire sometimes, you just want to get it done efficiently and economically. That's why I developed QwiKFix. By having a subscription with QwikFix, customers just click and get it done. The subscription simplifies the scheduling, and takes away price issues. By paying monthly or annually, you don't have to worry about the cost for labor, it's included. Customers buy time, which can be used for a multitude of projects over the subscription term. Simple, efficient, Qwik !</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need your help to succeed ! </h3>
<p>We are currently looking for Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) to get us to the next level.</p>
<p>Our full function web site along with our web app is live!. We are currently building our contractor and provider list in our local area and we even have a few local customers who signed up because of personal knowledge of the business. We need funds now for customer acquisition and knowledge seminars for our contractors. </p>
<ul>
<li>QwikFix will be a huge success with help from you! We know their is a need. We know there are homeowners and small business owners staring at small repairs every day that just don't get done because they don't have a simple solution.</li>
<li>We know there are contractors and service providers looking to pick up extra work and income but don't want the hassle of advertising, taking calls, going on estimates for smaller jobs. When told they can grab a job on their smartphone based on their current location and skill set, they love it !</li>
<li>We would love to secure our full campaign amount or more, but will be able to put any amount to good use in our advertising for contractors and customers. The subscription based model will provide additional funding as we grow but a push forward now will get us there sooner. </li>

<p>We truly appreciate your interest ad help in making QwikFix successful! We will be helping to employ many throughout the country over as we expand. We want to have a focus on helping our veterans get work as well as those who need the flexibility to work that our platform offers like single parents. As we grow, we are looking to give back by offering service through charitable contributions of service time to those who live difficult conditions and cannot afford the repairs they need. We want to make an impact on the quality of life for those less fortunate, but we need your help to get us on our feet first so that we may carry some of the burden for others.</p>
<p>I know the model will be a success, I have started to utilize it in another business I am building. QwikPlow (which will become a division of QwikFix as we mature) - is an on demand snow removal service that I started this past winter. I had bought a truck and plow 2 years ago to help my son and nephew get started. I soon realized that just before or during a snowstorm, the phone would ring constantly for service, but aside from the local calls, others would be coming from miles away in different towns. There was no way we could travel to all of these in different directions. QwikPlow was born. I began reaching out to independent snow removal people form the surrounding areas. We had them sign up with us and used a third party GPS tracking app to keep tabs on their location during a storm. When calls came in for areas we could not cover, we simply found the closest driver and referred the job to him for a small fee. We even signed up customers for contracts for the entire season. By using this method, we were able to service many customers under our brand - QwikPlow. </p>
<p>I know the model works, we WILL be extremely successful and  grow across the country and more. Please help us get a jump start ! Thank you</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>QwikFix will have it's challenges, but we know we can overcome them ! Advertising is extremely important as we need to not just get our name recognized, but customers and contractors  need to understand the platform, they need to be comfortable utilizing it.</p>
<p>Our biggest concern right now is contractor availability and reliability. We learned with QwikPlow that we need to have redundancy of in our contractor base. Trucks broke down, accidents happened, drivers got tired and burned out after hours of plowing. We had to have a number of different providers in the area in order to assure proper service. This is also a challenge for QwikFix, one of our biggest. We are actively signing up contractors in various areas as well as with many different trade skills in order to provide seamless service.</p>
<p>We also need to have a redundant system in place for technical issues and failures. We cannot lose contact with customers and service providers. This presents a challenge, especially as we grow.</p>
<p>Again, we thank you !</p>
<p>We know that not everyone has the ability to help with funding this project, but we do appreciate your reading through this and hope that you will spread the word about QwikFix. Sometimes the best advertising is word of mouth or personal statements on social media. Let the world know we are coming and look forward to not only help get things done around the home and office, but also help those who need a hand up !</p>

In our case, this means turning pixels into pen and ink in new and unexpected ways. So we want the Joto App and Platform to make it easier for you to enjoy playing with your Joto.</p>
<p>You can control multiple Joto units, create quick Jots, import your own artwork and share content with the rest of the Joto community. And if you're not feeling particularly creative, theres plenty of pre-drawn content to allow you to send amazing Jots from day one.</p></figure></div>

</div></div>","Joto is the first robotic whiteboard that draws with a pen and erases. It is designed to be hung on your wall like a picture frame. Joto is not another screen, quite the opposite, it turns pictures and words from your screen into pen and ink drawings.As soon as you send something to it, Joto's pen starts to move. It has an eraser and a dock too, so the pen doesn’t dry out and when you are ready for something new, it refreshes the surface and prepares itself for your next Jot. People say there’s something about the way Joto jots live. There's something that mesmerises, excites and inspires. It seems some things in life are just better off screen! 
 


 

 
Joto takes requests, sketching everything from works of art to love notes, to-do lists to puzzles. We believe Joto is as versatile as its users are creative. Using the Joto app, on a computer or mobile device, you can discover, create and share jots. These are some ways you can turn images and text into beautiful ink drawings and make the most of Joto.
 A sketch of Hockney for when you’re hosting a summer BBQ. Klimt's The Kiss for romancing. And Dogs Playing Poker for a boys’ night in. Obviously. Waking up to a new piece of art every day now is possible. To celebrate the launch of Joto we're releasing something special: 365 days of Art. Like the sound of it? Find out more below!   

 Hang Joto in the kitchen and it’s a family to-do-list. Pop it up in a cafe and it's an updatable menu. Or use it in the workplace and it’s a nifty noticeboard. Joto is also easy to update, so you can schedule different content throughout the day to suits your needs. 
 
 Quotations, tweets, headlines, happy birthdays and “Hello, how are you?”s. Joto can handle them all. Jot-to-Jot Messaging is even enabled, allowing you to scribble on your friend’s wall from anywhere in the world.  
 


 
The Joto platform is based on the simple insight that creativity and experimentation bring joy to people’s lives. In our case, this means turning pixels into pen and ink in new and unexpected ways. So we want the Joto App and Platform to make it easier for you to enjoy playing with your Joto.
You can control multiple Joto units, create quick Jots, import your own artwork and share content with the rest of the Joto community. And if you're not feeling particularly creative, theres plenty of pre-drawn content to allow you to send amazing Jots from day one.

   

To celebrate the launch of Joto, we’re excited to announce something we call 365 days of Art. You can get your Joto with 365 unique pieces art, each created by a top illustrator. That’s a brand new, inspirational image on your wall, every day, for a year.  
This series awesome illustrations created by is just an example of the artwork that you can get delivered straight to your wall. Don't miss out, get your Joto with 365 Days of Art!

We're honoured to have artists from around the world excited about being part of 365 Days of Art. Just some of the illustrators that will be producing artwork for Joto include Anthony Burrill, Supermundane, Ben the Illustrator, Will Scobie, Mr. Bingo, Jon Burgerman, Quibe, Kaloian Toshev, Jordan Metcalf, Salventius, Sneaky Raccoon, Ben Johnston,  JARD Design, Burnt Toast Creative and Thomas Hedger.
 


Our Discovery section will connect you to some of the world’s most exciting artists and illustrators and provide you with the latest news from the creative industry. We’re currently working hard to get all the content ready that will be available at launch and to finalise some interesting partnerships that will bring in more exciting content in the future.
A few of our previous collaborators such as Anthony Burrill, Will Scobie, Ben the Illustrator, Burnt Toast Creative and Thomas Hedger among others, will be releasing their content on the app, ready to exhibit on your Joto. An ever-growing community of design enthusiasts, artists, illustrators, makers and hackers are excited to see how Joto will change the way we communicate and display the things we love.  We've made sure that Joto's software has been built so it can integrate with your favourite apps.For all you makers and tinkerers, the accompanying Joto app has also been designed to allow further integrations and connections. We're now working with developers in our community and we'll be releasing a public API soon. We're making key parts of the software available and open so that you can experiment outside our cloud platform. We want you to be free to come up with as many amazing and crazy ways to use Joto as possible.  It turns out people love Joto. We were over the moon when Joto was announced as Winner of the Beazley Design of the Year Public Vote at the Design Museum in February. Joto was the public's favourite over social and visitors to the museum, now we can’t wait for you all to be part of the Joto movement and see what would you jot!   
 


We spent a year at the Central Research Laboratory in London developing the initial ideas for Joto. One of the UK's first hardware incubators. They have helped us develop both the hardware and our business with a programme of mentorship and learning.
We went through many design iterations and prototypes to get to our final prototype prior to launching on Kickstarter and Indiegogo. 

 
We've worked tirelessly with our manufacturers in Shenzhen to make Joto a reality.  Here's a few photos of the journey that we've been on.

<p>Bacteria seems to be great stuff of nightmares. Most common bacteria found in bedding is gram-negative rods ~42 percent,  gram-positive rods ~27%, both bacilli ~ 25 % and gram-positive cocci ~12 percent. The power of silver technology will help fight these pathogens so that your bedding remains fresh. </p>

<p>Silver does it's deadly work when it comes in contact with bacteria, fungus or virus. Alpha Sheets 2.0 feel better, smells better and only needs to be washed 7X less frequently than standard cotton sheets.  Alpha's silver is fully coated on to the fibers for a more permanent effect. Now everyone can have cleaner bedding that we all deserve. </p>

</div></div>","Alpha™ Silver Sheets 2.0 are scientifically engineered sheets, made with pure silver fibers and ultra soft premium cotton to help your bed remain cleaner by fighting germs, bacteria, fungus, viruses and other pathogens.
Utilizing game changing pure silver Micron™ Tech, Stain Repel and Wrinkle Resist, Alpha has become the ultimate natural bedding to help promote a healthier lifestyle.
 

 

 
 
Premium breathable materials in combination with pure silver fibers to helps the bedding to stay cleaner and help better regulate temperature. Alpha will help provide you with the most comfortable bedding so that you're prepared for a restful night sleep.
 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 



 
 

 
 
Bacteria seems to be great stuff of nightmares. Most common bacteria found in bedding is gram-negative rods ~42 percent,  gram-positive rods ~27%, both bacilli ~ 25 % and gram-positive cocci ~12 percent. The power of silver technology will help fight these pathogens so that your bedding remains fresh.

Silver does it's deadly work when it comes in contact with bacteria, fungus or virus. Alpha Sheets 2.0 feel better, smells better and only needs to be washed 7X less frequently than standard cotton sheets.  Alpha's silver is fully coated on to the fibers for a more permanent effect. Now everyone can have cleaner bedding that we all deserve. 
  
 
 
 

 
 
Milk experiment between Alpha Sheets 2.0 and Regular Cotton Sheets. Both sheets were washed in 99% alcohol and air dried before placing in the test tube. We added a pasteurized organic milk, cover the test tubes and let the bacteria do its job.  
Real experimental data shown.
 
The milk with Alpha Sheets remained fresh, where as the Cotton Sheets grew Billions of Bacteria. That's the power of Alpha's Self-Cleaning fabric with 100% pure silver fibers. 
 
 

 
 
 Alpha's waterproof sheets will keep the liquid spills away from your mattress. It can also be a valuable asset during potty training, providing an extra layer of protection for your mattress.
 
 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 
 
You will be able to choose Alpha's size preferences in the survey after the campaign ends.

Why not putting signal lights on your bicycle to let other people know your direction and speed? 


Why not making it smarter than other products on the market by using a gyroscope so you won't be distracted ? 

Inspired by cars, motorcycles and even by my iPhone, I designed the first smart bike light with passion in a bicycle friendly city, Madison, WI.  


The Alltoo Smart Bike Light Signals a Revolution in Bike Safety.




The cutting edge technology in the Alltoo smart bike light is revolutionizing bike safety. 

It has a number of cutting edge features that will keep you, your partner and your kids safe on the road. With automatic signaling and laser lane indicators, this bike light will make sure others see you at all times!

<br/>Not only will you have access to tools and machinery, but you will also be part of an exclusive Motocraze community that is friendly and encourages helping each other out.  OtoMoto takes your typical motorcycle workshop, and puts a DIY spin to it. Our staff are not there to do the repairs or upgrades for you. But don't worry - they will definitely be there to share their knowledge with you, while at the same time providing you with access to the tools and equipment necessary to create or maintain your dream bike. The DIY and community culture aspect of Otomoto - named after our founder, Sergio Otoya -  puts us one step above our competition. By creating a unique learning experience, along with a strong sense of community, we develop a specific niche in the moto market. Even though there are a fair number of bike workshops, and the barrier to entry is present, our workshop can be started for around $30,000. </div>

<p>   Have you ever come across a situation, where you want to surprise a loved one, to express your love, to give away gift, so powerful, so memorable, so pure that leave a trace forever? <br/>   Well, I myself was caught in the same situation a year ago. I was about to lose one person, whom I loved very much, so I wanted to leave one last memory with which to express my boundless love.</p>
<p>I remember then I read a statement: ""<i>I can not promise you that I will give you everything, but I can give you my heart. It's not much, but it's all I have.</i>""</p>
<p>   This expression describing exactly how I felt then. So I got the idea for a gift, a small and yet so big. I decided to give my heart. Of course not literally, but I decided it to be an official document-certificate. Its goal is to dedicate a place in my heart for a loved one, and to leave a pleasant memory forever.<br/><br/>So that's how <b>""Reserve-Place-In-My-Heart""</b> was born.<br/></p>
<p>   I thought, I'm not the only one. There are so many people around the world who want to show their love, to give physical form to their words, to leave a memory of themselves long after they leave this world. <br/>   What better than a beautiful gift that will adorn the showcase, the wall, the desk, bedside table, the shelves , the room, the house etc.?<br/>   Let's be honest, everyone needs to love and be loved. Every man, woman, child, animal, even a plant. I think this is a new, unique and innovative way to show that love.</p>
<p>   As I shared my idea with my friend from childhood, with whom we have many ""projects"", as transforming bicycles, tuning motors and cars, airbrush painting and so on, he was immediately captivated, and did not need more than a few seconds to say ""YES! I'm in.""<br/>   So before I continue, let me introduce you <b>The Team</b>.                              <br/></p>

<p>Hi everyone! My name is Andreea Egli and I'm the founder and creative director of House of Egli and I manufacture luxury scented soy candle. I' m actually a jack of all trades since the company is comprised of me, myself and I. </p>
<p>In real life, I have nothing to do with candle making. I work for a company in an unrelated business field. You could say that I'm a double agent, a 9 to 5 office worker by day and an entrepreneur by night. I call myself a sidepreneur. </p>
<p>Leaving all the that aside, I can tell you that I've always loved scented candles. Loved loved them. The idea came up to me on a rainy day, last December. Quite poetic but true. Don't remember exactly but I was going through some YT videos and I stumbled upon one that was explaining how commercial candles are made and how toxic they can be. I was a bit shocked and since I was regularly burning them I went on and did some research. It was all true. Commercial candles are all made of paraffin wax, a petroleum based mineral wax that consists of a mixture of hydrocarbon molecules. Even the very big luxury candle brands use toxic waxes in their products. The wax I will be using is made of soy beans. Soy wax is a vegetable wax made of the oils of soybeans and is <b>100% natural</b>. </p>
<p>Long story short, I decided to buy some supplies and try make my own. I realised that I not only found a hobby but stumbled upon an idea. I said to myself, why not, I love the business side of it and I love candles. And if they are ""healthy"" for you, why not share them with the world to enjoy. I'm not a doctor or a shrink but this is my way of helping people. This might sound corny but imagine you are on a romantic date and somewhere in the background, a beautiful candle is burning quietly, filling the room with amazing scents or, you come home from a terrible day at work, prepare yourself a luxurious bath and light up a candle and you just drift away. Well, I call that escaping presence because my candles do just that.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the prototype from start to finish:</p>

<p>This campaign is important to me because it will help me build something incredible that I strongly believe in. From a business point of view, I want the company to be socially responsible. I plan to run a green work studio and use natural supplies (where possible, i.e. the fragrances used are not essential oils) when creating my candle collections. A certain percentage of the annual profits will go towards the animal shelters here in Cyprus. My little cat, Maya has inspired me and helped me decide. In the future, I hope to help other not for profit organisations.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now coming down to the business part of the campaign, I need your contribution. I need you to back me up on this venture.</p>
<p>I have been working from my bedroom testing, testing and... yes more testing since January. It has been extremely difficult and frustrating to create amazing candles since there is no space in my apartment and there is no other place to work from at the moment. Also, since there are no candle making suppliers in Cyprus, I had to look overseas for these. The shipping its quite expensive but there is no other way to procure my supplies. I've been funding my venture from my own personal money with no help from others. Its been a rollercoaster, from excitement to frustration.</p>
<p>I've vetted many suppliers and I now found the ones am ready to work with.</p>
<p>So, the funding that I will receive from YOU, my backers and contributors will partly go towards leasing a work space, studio for at least 6 months if not 1 year and partly towards buying all the supplies I need in bigger quantities. This will help save a lot of time.</p>
<p>If I don't reach my entire funding goal, depending on the amount, the funds will go towards buying the supplies I need.</p>
<p>I will launch the brand in September so I need to make sure that I have everything that I need beforehand.  </p>

</div><div>Thank you in advance for your contribution and interest in this campaign and venture.</div></div>","Short Summary 
Hi everyone! My name is Andreea Egli and I'm the founder and creative director of House of Egli and I manufacture luxury scented soy candle. I' m actually a jack of all trades since the company is comprised of me, myself and I. 
In real life, I have nothing to do with candle making. I work for a company in an unrelated business field. You could say that I'm a double agent, a 9 to 5 office worker by day and an entrepreneur by night. I call myself a sidepreneur. 
Leaving all the that aside, I can tell you that I've always loved scented candles. Loved loved them. The idea came up to me on a rainy day, last December. Quite poetic but true. Don't remember exactly but I was going through some YT videos and I stumbled upon one that was explaining how commercial candles are made and how toxic they can be. I was a bit shocked and since I was regularly burning them I went on and did some research. It was all true. Commercial candles are all made of paraffin wax, a petroleum based mineral wax that consists of a mixture of hydrocarbon molecules. Even the very big luxury candle brands use toxic waxes in their products. The wax I will be using is made of soy beans. Soy wax is a vegetable wax made of the oils of soybeans and is 100% natural. 
Long story short, I decided to buy some supplies and try make my own. I realised that I not only found a hobby but stumbled upon an idea. I said to myself, why not, I love the business side of it and I love candles. And if they are ""healthy"" for you, why not share them with the world to enjoy. I'm not a doctor or a shrink but this is my way of helping people. This might sound corny but imagine you are on a romantic date and somewhere in the background, a beautiful candle is burning quietly, filling the room with amazing scents or, you come home from a terrible day at work, prepare yourself a luxurious bath and light up a candle and you just drift away. Well, I call that escaping presence because my candles do just that.
Here is a breakdown of the prototype from start to finish:

This is the signature glass I will use for all four candles, with a capacity of 30 cl.
This is the signature box I will use to pack the candle in.Here are the label samples and a short description of the fragrances:
  Alpine Forest luxury scented candle
The clean fresh invigorating smell of a snowy winter's day. This fragrance begins with top notes of fresh lime and menthol, middle notes of Douglas fir and lavender, and full-bodied base notes of eucalyptus and pine.

  Arabian Nights luxury scented candle
Top notes of green leaf, citrus and mint, heart notes of ginger, patchouli and jasmine, followed by base notes of vanilla, musk and sandalwood.

 Paradise Beach luxury scented candle
Escape to paradise. This stunning fragrance combines fresh bergamot, bright orange and rich amber with warming notes of exotic coconut, vanilla and almond.


 Delicious Pomegranate luxury scented candle
Top notes of plum, pomegranate and Rose with heart notes of patchouli, cedarwood, violet leaf and Spice, and base notes of musk, amber, vanilla and leather.And last but not least, the label that will go on the container:
 
The finished product will look as per below:




Please bear in mind that this is just a test candle. 
One of the two tissue papers will be used to pack the candle. This will be wrapped around the candle to keep it safe and amazing looking.


or
The ribbon will be wrapped around the box. I cannot decide at this point whether I will go with four different colours or use just simple black or maybe gold.

I hope that this breakdown helps you to get a feel of the product and get excited about it as I am!
This campaign is important to me because it will help me build something incredible that I strongly believe in. From a business point of view, I want the company to be socially responsible. I plan to run a green work studio and use natural supplies (where possible, i.e. the fragrances used are not essential oils) when creating my candle collections. A certain percentage of the annual profits will go towards the animal shelters here in Cyprus. My little cat, Maya has inspired me and helped me decide. In the future, I hope to help other not for profit organisations.
   What We Need & What You Get
Now coming down to the business part of the campaign, I need your contribution. I need you to back me up on this venture.
I have been working from my bedroom testing, testing and... yes more testing since January. It has been extremely difficult and frustrating to create amazing candles since there is no space in my apartment and there is no other place to work from at the moment. Also, since there are no candle making suppliers in Cyprus, I had to look overseas for these. The shipping its quite expensive but there is no other way to procure my supplies. I've been funding my venture from my own personal money with no help from others. Its been a rollercoaster, from excitement to frustration.
I've vetted many suppliers and I now found the ones am ready to work with.
So, the funding that I will receive from YOU, my backers and contributors will partly go towards leasing a work space, studio for at least 6 months if not 1 year and partly towards buying all the supplies I need in bigger quantities. This will help save a lot of time.
If I don't reach my entire funding goal, depending on the amount, the funds will go towards buying the supplies I need.
I will launch the brand in September so I need to make sure that I have everything that I need beforehand.  
Now, what's in it for you! Well, some amazing perks!

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution no matter how small will make it so the Macro project can continue and soon see the light of day in the form of a manufactured part versus a hand made modification. Every year about 50 million tons of electronic waste ends up in our landfills. Electronic devices contain harmful materials and chemicals that pollute the environment and our water supplies. By supporting this project, you will contribute to a small part of that waste being repurposed. Broken nintendo DS consoles could be converted into beautiful GBA gaming devices.</p>

Crave Technologies was created for the sole purpose of bringing city-grade High-Speed Internet to the rural consumer. We have succeeded, but we're not done.</p>
<p>With the new fiber optic based Internet systems, once again the rural consumer is lagging behind. It doesn't have to be that way. We now have products available to us that can reach similar speeds to fiber, at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>Our network covers about half of Grand Manan with good quality Internet, however Grand Manan has a shortage of bandwidth. This campaign will fund not only a new wireless link to the mainland, but it will add more coverage to the network. Also it will allow upgrades to the existing system to allow for the new 100+mbps customer connections.</p>
<p>We can solve the Rural Internet issues, together.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>We need about $100,000 USD to complete the project. Where does all that money go do you ask? </p>
<p>1.) A radio system consisting of a tower on Grand Manan, and a transmitter site either in Black's Harbour or St. George.</p>
<p>2.) Two 1gbps wireless links. These will both be operational, but if one fails, the other will carry the load. Full redundancy.</p>
<p>3.)1 Mile of fiber, to bring the internet we need to the Blacks Harbour site..</p>
<p>4.)Shelters at each tower to house electrical and networking components.</p>

Crave Technologies was created for the sole purpose of bringing city-grade High-Speed Internet to the rural consumer. We have succeeded, but we're not done.
With the new fiber optic based Internet systems, once again the rural consumer is lagging behind. It doesn't have to be that way. We now have products available to us that can reach similar speeds to fiber, at a fraction of the cost.
Our network covers about half of Grand Manan with good quality Internet, however Grand Manan has a shortage of bandwidth. This campaign will fund not only a new wireless link to the mainland, but it will add more coverage to the network. Also it will allow upgrades to the existing system to allow for the new 100+mbps customer connections.
We can solve the Rural Internet issues, together.
What We Need & What You Get

We need about $100,000 USD to complete the project. Where does all that money go do you ask? 
1.) A radio system consisting of a tower on Grand Manan, and a transmitter site either in Black's Harbour or St. George.
2.) Two 1gbps wireless links. These will both be operational, but if one fails, the other will carry the load. Full redundancy.
3.)1 Mile of fiber, to bring the internet we need to the Blacks Harbour site..
4.)Shelters at each tower to house electrical and networking components.
5.)Wireless links to feed the new bandwidth into the heart of our existing network, turbocharging the entire system.
6.)New Routers and switches to bring the network up to 1gbps for backbone links every point on the network.
7.) New wireless equipment to bring the capability for customers to get over 100mbps to their homes and businesses. Our mid-range package is forecast to be 25mbps, over 3 times faster than Aliant.
8.) Two new towers for increased coverage of the island. (Pending funding)
The entire amount will be put into new equipment, and the new link to the mainland.
Major perks:
1.) You will be helping rural users around the globe to bridge the digital divide
2.)The people of Grand Manan Island will finally have true, ultra hi-speed internet.
3.) You will allow us to build and test the system and iron the bugs out.
4.) We will create a network system that anyone with some knowledge and skill can implement, anywhere.
What if you don't reach your goal?
If we do not meet our goal, what we will do depends largely on what we do raise. One of the goals is to build the link to the mainland. We will use the funds we raise to build this link first. We will upgrade what we can with whats left.
If we aren't successful in raising enough to build the link, we will perform upgrades to the network with what we do raise. 
The Perks!
The people of Grand Manan Island will no longer lag behind when it comes to speed and technology, they will lead.
The Impact

The impact for the island will be immediate, and powerful. We are losing out on business by not having a first class network to use. We can attract new business and keep what we have.
As for the impact of a pre-packaged network solution, think of this. Say a disaster happens and communications are knocked out. (Sound Familiar?) This system will be able to be containerized and deployed rapidly and cheaply for disaster relief, or providing affordable connections in the developing world.
I have spent 9 years building this network from nothing, to what it is today. We have customers such as Canadian Coast Guard, University of Maine, Bowdoin College, Coastal Transport Ltd, just to name a few.
This is very doable, for this cost. I can do it, all I need is your help. Risks & Challenges
As with anything, there is risk. Here are the ones I am concerned most with.
1.) The regional Telecom, BellAliant could swoop in and run fiber all over the island, squeezing me out. However, their investment would be about $15 million. Our system is much better suited for our low population (2500+-).
2.) Competition from other players. This is possible, but it's a small market and there are really only 2 major players, Crave Technologies and BellAliant. I do not see anyone else trying to tap this market.
3.) Engineering challenges. Is it good digging, or have we got ledge to worry about? Something broke, where can I get it welded? I have 30 years in the computer field, 18 years in welding, 23 years in mechanics, holder of a Power Engineering license, Millwright/ Industrial mechanic, Licensed Auto Mechanic. 10 years in networking, 10 years self-employed.

<h3>Huge time savings - New lifestyle - Free at last!</h3>
<p><strong>It was meant to happen!</strong> There is too much time lost in cooking at home and the burden most often falls on the lady of the house. If at the same time she has to work the burden can become a nightmare. <strong>No more!</strong> On the other hand, as builders of <strong>technologically advanced homes</strong>, specialising the last decade on zero energy housing, we have watched many of our clients spending large amounts of money in <strong>kitchen furniture</strong> and <strong>equipmen</strong>t, only to confess most of them that they would scarcely use what they invested on and, having to work on full time jobs, they would have to live mainly on deliveries and takeaways. It seemed as a natural conclusion to us that an <strong>automated robotic kitchen</strong>, that would not cost more than what our clients spent anyway on a <strong>classic kitchen</strong>, would get them out of thus vicious circle. <strong>Prometheus Robotic Kitchen</strong> would be the answer.</p>
<h3><strong>Our robots in your service</strong></h3>
<p>We set up a team and research centre almost two years ago and, started with the concept and ended with a fully featured working prototype of a <strong>fully automated kitchen</strong> which not only meets our original expectations but through the experience acquired on the way went far beyond them. Costs were thankfully kept within our original forecasts without compromising quality. The <strong>robotic kitchen </strong>working prototype presented in the accompanying video and photos has gone through exhaustive tests proving the durability and integrity of the system beyond doubt even though some prototype parts had to be printed on 3Ds instead of the<strong> titanium</strong> on the production model.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536948599/xfkuilwtiuoqe5babhur.png"" src=""""/> We are also very proud for the software system we proprietary developed by which recipes are coded. It is extremely user friendly, works as a simple puzzle game and using it we are able to code <strong>thousands of recipes </strong>in only a few steps.</p>
<h3>A life changer, not just a high tech kitchen</h3>
<p>Our <strong>automated kitchen</strong> intents to liberate households from the burden of cooking, elevate the quality of living and allow families and individuals, in case they need to, to use their newly acquired<strong> free time </strong>to increase their <strong>household income</strong> as well. They will just have to supply the fresh ingredients for <strong>any recipe</strong> in the integrated refrigerator of the kitchen and off to their jobs, The <strong>robots</strong> need only to know <strong>when the meal should be ready</strong>, for how many <strong>servings</strong> and specific <strong>taste preferences</strong>. These instructions are sent to the system via WiFi from anyplace. Home or office, via smartphone, tablet or laptop or desk top computer.</p>

And just in case you get an urge to <strong>cook on manual</strong> like in old times please go ahead and rest assured that the robots will take no offence. You are their master and they know it!</p>
<h3>Robots never forget - And they always do it right</h3>
<p>On another tone, what is really nice about robots is that whatever they are taught they never forget. And as such, <strong>a recipe they cook for a thousand times</strong> will always be as delicious as they cooked it the first time, provided of course the ingredients a user supplies will not be inferior, The <strong>delta robots</strong> can move with an accuracy of as little is one tenth of a millimetre! This will be evident in the video especially when replacing pot lids to <strong>pots</strong> and <strong>pressure cookers</strong>.This <strong>precision in robotic behaviour</strong> guarantees excellent and consistent results, no more burnt food, too salty, too spicy, All of these will be apparent in the full story video we provided that records from start to finish the complete process of preparing one of the most demanding recipes which includes 15 ingredients</p>
<h3>The best tastes on your plate</h3>
<p>I am an engineer, not a chef. But even with the fully functional working prototype of our <strong>robotic kitchen</strong> I can assure you I can pick up the <strong>best recip</strong>e from a <strong>grandmaster's chef</strong> cookbook and cook it the <strong>exact same way</strong> the grandmaster did in the first place.</p>
<h3>Why we need you to support the the Robotic Kitchen</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our company has a long successful record in home building with a large score of happy customers who keep us going by word of mouth and we have been a few of the companies that stood steady even during the financial crisis a few years back. For this reason we have been able to be debt free all along and our relations with our bank is only depositing and withdrawing.This is why we could curry the financial burden of researching and prototyping from our own pocket up to this moment and still have the means to go a few steps forward, but not for long. This is a venture with <strong>worldwide impact</strong> and need people who look to the future <strong>come and walk with us</strong>.</p>
<p>With a <strong>fully working prototype</strong> and the firmware/software we developed we are in fact ready to start setting up production ourselves on a small scale within the financial framework of our own company. But that is not our intention. Small scale production will not guarantee the low cost that would make our product accessible to the <strong>average household</strong> and we do not want to sell it just to the very rich. We intend to go into mass production and come out strong with at least one plant in Europe and others in the United States and Asia so as to  keep the shipping costs as low as possible. We also intend to co-operatre with established <strong>home appliance manufacturers</strong>  who can provide us with the <strong>appliances our robotic kitchen uses</strong>, such as refrigerators, hobs, ovens, electric pressure cookers, etc. This way we can use the distribution network and their representatives <strong>worldwide</strong> to install and service the <strong>robotic kitchen</strong> to as many regions and countries as possible.</p>
<h3>Be part of our success</h3>
<p>This is why we need your help and our gratitude to you will be in the form of promissory share notes for the brand new company that will be established by the day this company ends with 20 million total shares of one USD each at a discounted price, of which <strong>a great part will be offered to contributors</strong> in perks of various values. In addition, each contribution over $1000  will carry a 10% discount on the ex-factory price of each<strong> robotic kitchen</strong> the contributor may want to purchase when the product is out on the market. Just bring to your mind those lucky fellow that believed in other unique ideas of success giants like Apple, Google and Microsoft and the smile on their faces when one day they found they were suddenly rich!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The challenges ahead</h3>
<p>We are targeting high for the reasons already explained, and it is very reasonable for one to ask: what if you fell short in funding. What happens with the funds you already got? We hope we will not have to, but if we do we go to plan-B: set up production to the scale our own funds and contributor funds allow and seek for industrial investors or a sort of franchising. We did file for patents which are now pending and we are protected even if they are not issued yet. However the best way to make sure you stay way ahead and that any possible future competition will have hard time to reach you<strong> is to come out strong and fas</strong>t. If you fail to do that and there is hot demand for your product then you are infected with overtrading and you become an easy prey for future competition which steps in to fill the gap.</p>
<p>Look what happened with electric pressure cookers. Not to mention names or brands, but famous electric  pressure cooker fell short in supplying their product to several continents for months while hot in demand and dozens of new brands  found the chance to emerge, some even probably better and cheaper!</p>
<p>Is walking with us a gamble? We are absolutely confident it is not! Especially if you consider what a life changer <strong>Prometheus Kitchen</strong> is destined to become for scores of households all over the world!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Spread the word</h3>
<p>Your help to our goal is valuable in any form. Even spreading the word around to friends and people you know, or passing on links to this campaign page, the <strong>robotic kitchen's</strong> website, to our facebook page and you tube channel would be an enormous help and would make us feel forever grateful.</p>

<h3><strong>Short Summary:</strong></h3>
<p>We are a design company from Romania called Renderistic. The team is made of a product designer, interior designer, architect and a 3D artist. You can find out more about us on our website  <a href=""http://www.renderistic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.renderistic.com</a></p>
<p>A small plastic factory, Highplast came and asked us how to improve the shoes organizer from the market to save even more space in homes. Their website: <a href=""http://www.highplast.ro/en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.highplast.ro/en</a></p>
<p>The brief was clear and simple, to help people declutter, organize their shoes and keep them clean. After a quick research we found out that the existing products on the market right now are very basic, without too many features to accommodate higher footwear, stacking or hanging.</p>
<p>Our product advantages:</p>
<p>After months of research, brainstorming and improvements we came with a concept that is saving more than 80% of space. The concept was 3D printed and tested in real life.</p>
<p>Our product has 3 unique advantages:</p>
<p><strong>1 - Can be stacked on top of each other for as tall as you want </strong></p>
<p>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559585515/brdtvw39rcwaleli43kc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>2 - Can be hooked on a nail in the wall, so just a single nail can hold more pairs of shoes!</strong></p>
<div> </div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559585615/lu44gdfvjdsvmtzueovy.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
<p><strong>3 - Fits even the highest shoes, like mountain boots and heels!</strong></p>
<div> </div>
<div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559585642/x7oapfe9wd2fmwcpmmk5.jpg"" src=""""/></div>
<p>The best part? <strong>You don't need to buy a shoe cabinet for them!</strong></p>
<p>No extra money spent, no extra space needed.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559585659/lyd9b1zrtxtjajokjd9i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Save money and space!</strong></p>
<p>No other product has these advantages right now!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The space or design of your lobby are not relevant since ShoeSpace is available in many colors!</p>
<p>For <strong>kids</strong>, for<strong> ladies</strong>, for <strong>men</strong>. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559585690/ssoe6fy1ggnzekjfj8eo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's perfect for:</p>
<p><strong>HOUSES<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559585721/rcllggvkcjir5cxiyrtf.png"" src=""""/></strong>                          <strong>APARTMENTS<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559585734/qec7ziof6h0xukt2zqoy.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>sport areas</strong>, <strong>schools</strong> or <strong>any places</strong> where people need to take off their shoes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559585767/gh6i61wv7asuqr8tgvmi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Why a fundraiser?</strong></h3>
<p>At this moment the concept is finished. We printed more than 40 3D pieces to test them in different environments and with many types of shoes. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary:
We are a design company from Romania called Renderistic. The team is made of a product designer, interior designer, architect and a 3D artist. You can find out more about us on our website  www.renderistic.com
A small plastic factory, Highplast came and asked us how to improve the shoes organizer from the market to save even more space in homes. Their website: www.highplast.ro/en
The brief was clear and simple, to help people declutter, organize their shoes and keep them clean. After a quick research we found out that the existing products on the market right now are very basic, without too many features to accommodate higher footwear, stacking or hanging.
Our product advantages:
After months of research, brainstorming and improvements we came with a concept that is saving more than 80% of space. The concept was 3D printed and tested in real life.
Our product has 3 unique advantages:
1 - Can be stacked on top of each other for as tall as you want 
         
 
2 - Can be hooked on a nail in the wall, so just a single nail can hold more pairs of shoes!
 

3 - Fits even the highest shoes, like mountain boots and heels!
 

The best part? You don't need to buy a shoe cabinet for them!
No extra money spent, no extra space needed.
Save money and space!
No other product has these advantages right now!
 
The space or design of your lobby are not relevant since ShoeSpace is available in many colors!
For kids, for ladies, for men. 

 
It's perfect for:
HOUSES                          APARTMENTS
sport areas, schools or any places where people need to take off their shoes.

Why a fundraiser?
At this moment the concept is finished. We printed more than 40 3D pieces to test them in different environments and with many types of shoes. 
The next step is to order the injection mold for mass production, which is quite costly. It is made of steel that has the mold of the product inside, in which the melted plastic is injected with high pressure.
Why are we confident in this idea?

In the last few years, the market for home accessories promising space saving started to grow. Nowadays, you can find shoes supports everywhere, both online and offline, even in local supermarkets. People need this kind of products because the spaces are getting crowded and houses all around the world.
We like the idea of helping people to have their homes more organized, but we want to do this in the best possible way.
Risks & Challenges
There is no big challenge to this moment. The injection mold takes two months to be made and right away we can deliver your orders.
The second challenge after the money can be the shipping. We are discussing with several good companies to accommodate this. We will be in touch with you for every step of the process.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> <strong> <u>Why the idea to build the most advanced Alarm Clock ?</u></strong>
</h2>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499341826/rsreyczrzvuthueqzd6t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The idea came to us two years ago when with friends having a general conversation and alarm clocks became the main subject.We discussed how we liked to wake up , and go to sleep , down falls and health risks of other devices  and agreed that there is no perfect alarm clock to suit everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Alarm clocks may seem like a thing of the past , people who use cell phones to wake up are missing out on a great luxury plus could be a health risk.</strong></p>
<p><u>Downfalls of other alarm clocks and devices</u></p>
<p>Starting with the fear that if the battery from the smartphone has no charge then no alarm is triggered.</p>
<p>With the traditional alarm clock, the power can fail, the wake-up sound is terrible, the LCD display is too bright, there is only one wake-up time setting  and functions are often complicated,</p>
<p>The rays of smartphones can be unhealthy and if a smartphone is defective it will not function correctly.</p>
<p>There was so many reasons to decide to start this project and to add what was needed to fit specific needs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>WHY PHARAO ?</u></strong></p>
<p>Why did we spell Pharao the way we did , to go back to the original spelling. English at first spelt it ""Pharao"", but the King James Bible revived ""Pharaoh"" with ""h"" from the Hebrew.The word Pharaoh has many meanings all being of the highest,greatest, up to King and the Pharao is all of these. The king of all Alarm Clocks in Hi - Tec and Design.</p>

<p><strong><u>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS</u></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Can I use the Pharao in any Country?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes. Just let us know in which country you reside while ordering, and the Pharao will be delivered with the appropriate adapter.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Where is the Pharao produced?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Software, development and design comes from Germany. The technical components are produced in the US and UK (Adafruit, Rasperry Foundation) and final assembly is done in Spain.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Should I be concerned about radiation similar to my cell phone, where Doctors advise not to have them on your night stand?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">No. There is absolutely no health concern. Studies from the Technion University in Haifa even suggest that keeping your cell-phone at arms-length can drastically reduce the quality of sperm.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Is the display not too bright when I am trying to sleep?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">With a single touch to the display you can set the display to Sleep, which will dim the display until the next alarm.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Is the Pharao available in different colours ?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The 5 unique designs are hand-crafted through an intricate process called water transfer printing. This is the only way for Pharao to maintain its’ one-of-a-kind Design.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>What is the purpose of the hologram on the top-side? </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Every Pharao has a unique 3D holographic serial number, which is integrated in every original pharaotec product. Additionally, every owner can register his serial number on our website.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Will there be a 12-hour (am/pm) time display?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">You can select between the 12-hour and 24-hour clock.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>What happens during a blackout?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Pharao will continue functioning for several hours using the extra strong built-in 3000mAh Battery.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>My home power experiences voltage peaks above 230V?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">No Problem. Thanks to our intelligent uninterruptable power supply, the Pharao alarm clock compensates these peaks and continues normal operation</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Why Wifi?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">You can accurately synchronize the time over an active internet connection. You can set the time manually, should no internet connection be available.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Which languages are currently available?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In the current version (v2.4.0) 15 langauges are available (English, German, Spanish, Italian, French, Dutch, Polish, Swedish, Turkish, Portuguese, Russian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese and Arabic).</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><strong>Can I wake up to my own music?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">You can connect your smartphone via bluetooth and stream your favourite music directly to the Pharao. Can I set two alarms? You can even set 14 different alarms.</p>

With the traditional alarm clock, the power can fail, the wake-up sound is terrible, the LCD display is too bright, there is only one wake-up time setting  and functions are often complicated,
The rays of smartphones can be unhealthy and if a smartphone is defective it will not function correctly.
There was so many reasons to decide to start this project and to add what was needed to fit specific needs.
 
WHY PHARAO ?
Why did we spell Pharao the way we did , to go back to the original spelling. English at first spelt it ""Pharao"", but the King James Bible revived ""Pharaoh"" with ""h"" from the Hebrew.The word Pharaoh has many meanings all being of the highest,greatest, up to King and the Pharao is all of these. The king of all Alarm Clocks in Hi - Tec and Design.

Feedback of  people who tested PHARAO in 10 Days
 
I've never been so gently awakened, just what I need to start a new day.
(Mark S.) Australia
 
As a  Pilot, I have to rely 100% on my alarm, with the intelligent charging system, I will also wake up if there is a long power failure, awesome.
John P. Michigan
 
It is really fun to browse through the menu and choose an exciting wake-up tone, the quality of the loudspeaker is really great.
M.Brown u.k.
 
An alarm clock with as many extras as Relaxing videos to fall asleep and a display with a dimmer function, you have thought of everything.
Katja s. Cologne Germany
 
There are really many details that make the Pharao unique, you can see everything in your language and the weekday is written out in full ,  the way the 3D laser crystal lights up when the alarm starts, very impressive.
Marisol F. Barcelona -España

 
Unfortunately we only got 1 day with the Pharao, for the remaining 9 days my children throughly tested it,  they were so enthusiastic about all functions and loved playing the games.
Peter & Jane Liverpool- England
 
All my life I had a boring alarm clock, black and red big digits. With the Water tranfer print design and the full color display, the Pharao looks extremely luxurious and fits into my bedroom.
Denise M. Paris
 
We have to have two Alarm clocks as we worked different shifts , the Pharao is amazing , you can set up to 14 alarms on it.

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
 
Can I use the Pharao in any Country?
Yes. Just let us know in which country you reside while ordering, and the Pharao will be delivered with the appropriate adapter.
 
Where is the Pharao produced?
Software, development and design comes from Germany. The technical components are produced in the US and UK (Adafruit, Rasperry Foundation) and final assembly is done in Spain.
 
Should I be concerned about radiation similar to my cell phone, where Doctors advise not to have them on your night stand?
No. There is absolutely no health concern. Studies from the Technion University in Haifa even suggest that keeping your cell-phone at arms-length can drastically reduce the quality of sperm.
Is the display not too bright when I am trying to sleep?
With a single touch to the display you can set the display to Sleep, which will dim the display until the next alarm.
Is the Pharao available in different colours ?
The 5 unique designs are hand-crafted through an intricate process called water transfer printing. This is the only way for Pharao to maintain its’ one-of-a-kind Design.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">We all know that owning a car (unless it is electric) means we are personally damaging the environment. Fuel emissions are a major contributor to climate change but electric vehicles are not an option for the majority of society at this point (cost, limited driving range etc). Reducing emissions isn’t the only way you can reduce your carbon footprint as a car owner. At Auto-Max we have developed an innovative eco-friendly solution for car care...</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Meet the all new water soluble refill Eco-Capsules.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Concept</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The core concept behind our cleaning solutions is that we have <img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488481906/nrcq660bzbch4kxfe27a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>created concentrates that do not contain water. Your conventional cleaning solution consists of up to 95% water, making it bulky and requiring storage in plastic containers. Taking the water out of the equation provides a much more convenient and eco-friendly solution in the form of super concentrates contained in water soluble capsules. Not only does this mean you are reducing the amount of plastic you use and have to dispose of, our products will also reduce the volume of delivery trucks required to get our product to market.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How does it work?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Once our capsules come into contact with water they will start dissolving. This means if you are using the car screen wash capsules all you need to do is pop one into your car screen wash reservoir and add some water. The concentrate is held in a soluble film which will also dissolve completely.</p>

</div></div>","We all know that owning a car (unless it is electric) means we are personally damaging the environment. Fuel emissions are a major contributor to climate change but electric vehicles are not an option for the majority of society at this point (cost, limited driving range etc). Reducing emissions isn’t the only way you can reduce your carbon footprint as a car owner. At Auto-Max we have developed an innovative eco-friendly solution for car care...
Meet the all new water soluble refill Eco-Capsules.
Concept
The core concept behind our cleaning solutions is that we have created concentrates that do not contain water. Your conventional cleaning solution consists of up to 95% water, making it bulky and requiring storage in plastic containers. Taking the water out of the equation provides a much more convenient and eco-friendly solution in the form of super concentrates contained in water soluble capsules. Not only does this mean you are reducing the amount of plastic you use and have to dispose of, our products will also reduce the volume of delivery trucks required to get our product to market.
How does it work?
Once our capsules come into contact with water they will start dissolving. This means if you are using the car screen wash capsules all you need to do is pop one into your car screen wash reservoir and add some water. The concentrate is held in a soluble film which will also dissolve completely.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>We are asking for $60,000, which is the cost of this initial launch of Cool Runnings. We believe in the idea, which is why we have already started on this journey. The $60,000 will allow us to recover what we have spent so far, and be able to go beyond the current launch of Cool Runnings to something more. The initial launch as described before will only be fully usable from an HVAC Technicians perspective. We hope to go beyond this capability to Electricians, Plumbers, Appliance Repair, Refrigeration, Insulation, Cabinetry, General Contractors, and so very much more. Again we are now entering Alpha Stages of the App which will begin to develop the functionality of the app. We believe in full visibility, so we will periodically update and reward based on the following:</p>

<p>We can't go in to production without you. </p>
<p>We have invested huge sums so far in developing the technology and getting the first prototypes through production and user tested. The success of this stage of the process has led us to this point and we are ready to go in to production. To make the jump to manufacturing our TechTrack device in large numbers, we really need you. The money raised via our Indiegogo campaign will bring the first 1000 units into production, seeing the official launch of TechTrack into the security market. </p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that your investment will see delivery of the TechTrack units by the end of January 2018. </p>
<p>All the financial, support and contribution you show us, will go into delivering you a TechTrack device that will protect the expensive property you want to keep safe. You will be the first people to have The TechTrack device in your hands. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQs</h2>
<p><strong>How does TechTrack work?</strong></p>
<p>In simple terms, as soon as the TechTrack device is moved, even slightly, it will activate and establish an Internet connection with Iota-Tech’s Cloud servers, which will then send a text to your chosen mobile number to tell you that a disturbance has been detected. You can also choose to have alerts sent to our Android and iPhone apps, and even your social media platforms.  </p>
<p><strong>Does TechTrack actually secure the item?</strong></p>
<p>No. You still need to use your normal method of locking your tack room or, for example, your bicycle. TechTrack gives you warning that someone is tampering with your item or premises but does not lock them.</p>
<p><strong>How is it different from other similar sounding devices?</strong></p>
<p>Most other movement detectors need Wi-Fi to work so are not suitable for rural locations or for use on items that may be used in different places. Many also need to be wired into an electric supply.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use it anywhere?</strong></p>
<p>As long as you can secure the TechTrack to your chosen item you can use it anywhere where there is any mobile signal. Iota-Tech uses a special multi-carrier SIM which means you are extremely likely to have a good signal, even in remote areas, as the SIM will connect to any available carrier.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use it to protect anything?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Although the GPS version does need to be securely fixed to your item or it could be removed, and therefore can’t track it for you.</p>
<p><strong>How do I fix it to a door?</strong></p>
<p>You can hang TechTrack on a simple hook, or fix it with Velcro to the back of a door. As soon as anyone even tries the door the movement will cause the TechTrack to text you.</p>
<p><strong>How do I fix it to a saddle?</strong></p>
<p>The best method we have found so far is to fix it via a combination lock to one of the D-rings. This means any thief cannot simply take it off and disable the GPS. We are currently in talks with several saddle makers regarding inserting the GPS part into saddles at the point of manufacture.</p>
<p><strong>Can I use one TechTrack for different items?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can.</p>
<p><strong>On what items can I use TechTrack?</strong></p>
<p>You can use it on tack room doors, locker doors on your lorry, sheds, garages, store rooms or your room door if you are a student in halls for example. Moveable items such as saddles, quads, bicycles, motorbikes, classic cars, tractors, ride on mowers, trailers etc can all be protected by TechTrack as long as the device is securely attached to the item by, for example, your normal padlock.</p>
<p><strong>If I have more than one TechTrack, how will I know which one is alerting me?</strong></p>
<p>When you register your device online you will have the opportunity to ‘name’ it eg “Polly’s saddle”, so when the text alert arrives it will say it’s from Polly’s saddle.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need a specific mobile service provider?</strong></p>
<p>No. TechTrack comes with a non-removable multi SIM which will automatically use the strongest mobile signal provider available. </p>
<p><strong>What if the mobile signal is variable or weak?</strong></p>
<p>The SIM card can switch from one provider to another if the signals are problematic.</p>
<p><strong>How does the alert message get to me?</strong></p>
<p>The TechTrack device connects to Iota-Tech’s Cloud servers via in Internet connection. Our servers can then text your mobile phone, message you using our Android and iPhone apps, or even connect to you via Social Media channels.</p>
<p><strong>How do I set up TechTrack to text my number?</strong></p>
<p>You can do this on your personal page on our website when you register your TechTrack. You can have up to three numbers notified.</p>
<p><strong>What if I change my mobile phone number?</strong></p>
<p>Just log in and change the number.</p>
<p><strong>What if the best mobile signal in my locality is out of action?</strong></p>
<p>The multi SIM will find the next best signal available.</p>
<p><strong>What if there is no mobile signal at the site I want to protect?</strong></p>
<p>If you wish to check the coverage for the location where you will be using TechTrack, here are the links to do this. Remember the multi SIM in the TechTrack will use the strongest signal available from ANY provider.  This has nothing to do with the provider for your mobile phone. Our multi-carrier SIM is extremely likely to be able to find a signal, better than normal mobile phones which are attached to one service provider only. We can provide you with information on Quality and Strength Of Signal at your location. TechTrack requires only a 2G connection, not 3G or 4G, so it is highly likely to be able to establish this.</p>

<p><strong>Over what distance will this work?</strong></p>
<p>TechTrack can contact you wherever you are in the world where there is a mobile phone signal. We recently moved an item in the UK and the message was received in California!</p>
<p><strong>Does it need wiring in?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>What if there is a power cut?</strong></p>
<p>The TechTrack does not need mains electricity to work so a power cut is not a problem. It is battery operated with a large rechargeable battery which lasts a long time. It also uses advanced low power management techniques in software and hardware to extend the battery life.</p>
<p><strong>What if I accidently set it off?</strong></p>
<p>Unlike house alarms the TechTrack will not cause a loud noise disturbance or text anyone else other than you, unless you wish up to two other people to be notified too.</p>
<p><strong>How long does the battery last?</strong></p>
<p>Typically several weeks, depending on how often the device is set off.</p>
<p><strong>How will I know if the battery needs charging?</strong></p>
<p>The servers at Iota-Tech monitor the TechTrack device and check on things like battery levels. They will text you to let you know if the battery is running low.</p>
<p><strong>How do I charge the battery?</strong></p>
<p>You just need to plug it in just as you would your mobile phone, using the suppled USB cable which is compatible with many mobile phones on the market. It will charge in the cigarette lighter of a car too, with a standard USB charging adapter.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know if it’s working?</strong></p>
<p>When you come to move something that you have protected with your TechTrack device it will naturally be set off, and will text you. This is deliberate so that you know it is working. Of course if someone is trying to steal your property you will also be alerted. You will be periodically texted to say that no activity has been detected, and that all is well with the device, or that it needs charging. There is also a blinking LED to let you know it is alive and armed.</p>
<p><strong>How do I set it to work?</strong></p>
<p>There is a small button you press to turn it on. You (or a thief!) cannot turn it off until it has been activated and alerted you. You can leave it turned on all the time if you wish. If you do want to turn it off, just hold the button down for five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Can I be alerted I another way other than text?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can download our iPhone and Android apps, and on your user area of our website you can also select various Social Media platforms on which to be notified should you wish.</p>
<p><strong>Can the signal be jammed?</strong></p>
<p>The TechTrack device has sophisticated anti-jamming detection technology and will do all it can to circumvent any jamming.</p>
<p><strong>Will it communicate with the Police?</strong></p>
<p>Iota-Tech is working with the Police to see if this would be a viable option.</p>
<p><strong>Do all the TechTracks in an area communicate with each other?</strong></p>
<p>They don’t talk to each other but our server software can detect if a number of TechTracks have been disturbed in a particular area and then all devices in that locality can be texted to say it has seen unusual activity and to take care.</p>
<p><strong>What do I get for the £5.99/$7.99 monthly charge?</strong></p>
<p>Just like your mobile phone you have to pay for data which covers all the texting (alerts and telling you it’s working), the battery monitoring and reminders.</p>

<p>My husband and I went looking for a project we could do together. Never in our wildest dreams did we envision that we would own not just one heritage church but two of them on the same property. Having said that, it is something of a passion project to renovate and convert two fallen-down buildings into a home we can be proud to call our own. </p>
<p>We are newly married, and starting from scratch all over again. Being that we are in our 40's, it does seem a bit daunting to take on two buildings that originate from 1883 and 1914. But one thing we do well as a team, is to have big dreams and work really hard to make them come true. </p>
<p>Adam is an Architect with a heart-of-gold, and has a passion for heritage buildings. Lin is a Historical Romance Author, and loves the idea she is helping to save a piece of local history as well as doing something very unique. </p>
<p>This campaign is about helping the Aussie couple to restore these vacant buildings, to keep them from deteriorating, and give them a chance to be alive with life again as a new loving home.</p>
<p>Without donations, we will lose an important part of Australian history of these two churches that sit in a little old mining town in Queensland.  As nobody was willing to take on such a mammoth and costly job as restoring the churches, without Lin and Adam's dedication, these buildings will fall into ruins. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are after $10,000 to help us put on a new roof, restumping the churches, install a kitchen and bathroom, fix the deteriorating stain-glass windows, new septic system and plumbing, painting (everything needs repainting), new stairs for the back and repairs on the front porch as it is dangerous to use the steps right now.  Plus a multitude of other necessary restorations. We are putting in a lot of our own money but need help to get us started. It will take a lot more than $10k but we are in this for the long haul with a 6 year plan. We are putting in a lot of sweat equity as we are doing as much by ourselves as we can. Your money will only be going towards specialist contractors and restoration materials.</p>
<p><strong>If we don't reach our fund goal</strong></p>
<p>The funds we do get will go into painting the church as it costs a lot to paint 22 ft ceilings. Lin loves to paint and will be doing most of it herself along with the help of Adam, her husband. </p>
<p><strong>What's the exciting perk?</strong></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m L, the founder of Ardor Bin Candle Co. My journey to clean living has been an amazing experience!

I’m L, the founder of Ardor Bin Candle Co. My journey to clean living has been an amazing experience! After a major life shift to becoming a vegan and a stout advocate for healthy living, I began to observe other elements in my environment that were harmful to both myself and my family.

<h3>Heat levels of the +me panels</h3>
<p><strong>+me</strong> - the double duvet version -<strong> is composed of 6 modules that satisfy 3 levels of </strong><b>warmth</b>, to easily reach your desired comfort in any part of the body (chest, legs, feet). </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601729008/xjwut3acowpeeiuhbj1b.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Our body is warmer than the bedroom. At night, we delegate the duvet to protect us and retain heat. There are complex systems to measure this property and since these are completely personal sensations and needs, we preferred to describe our products by creating a scale from 1 to 5, aware that it remains a suggestion, an indication, the result of our research and experience.</p>
<p><strong>+me has 3 heat levels available:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Level 1 (80 gr/m2)</strong> = light, to cover the hottest area of the body</li>
<li>
<strong>Level 3 (130 gr/m2) </strong>= medium, to cover the body area with medium temperature</li>
<li>
<strong>Level 5 (180 gr/m2) </strong>= heavy, to cover the cold parts of the body</li>

<p> </p>
<h2>BENEFITS</h2>
<p>Prior to <strong>+me</strong> the choice of the best duvet was extremely difficult because:</p>
<p>1. long discussion between you and your partner about the level of heat</p>
<p>2. assess the exact warmth needed in every part of your body</p>
<p>3. avoid heavy duvet to get enough warmth</p>
<p>4. one duvet could not match all seasons needs (autumn/winter/spring)</p>
<p>5. washability and storage space required</p>
<h3><strong>Today, with +me years of compromise come to the end.</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602506350/f7kvoxffciymw8mqgax7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. you customize your <strong>+me</strong> duvet according to your and your partner needs</p>
<p>2. you exactly match the warmth you dream on chest, legs and feet</p>
<p>3. <strong>+me</strong> weighs less than 2 kg, due to the high quality of goose down </p>
<p>4. you can change the panels' combination whenever you want, whenever the season changes</p>
<p>5. you wash <strong>+me</strong> into the washing machine by splitting the panels.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>FEATURES</h2>
<p>Fabric: 100% cotton</p>
<p>Padding: 100% white goose down</p>
<p>Regulations: Class 1 European Standards EN 12934- 100% Natural Product. Dedust, washed and sterilized in compliance with Italian Presidential Decree 845 23/1/75 and D.M. 315 10/11/76. Contains non-textile parts of animal origin.<br/>Warranty: 2 years</p>
<p>Composition: 3+3 panels with a dimension of 250x220 cm and 40 buttons</p>
<p>Features: every panel of <strong>+me</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>heats in a differentiated way, thanks to the different weight of goose down </li>
<li>retains heat evenly, thus carrying out its thermoregulatory action with great effectiveness, thanks to the particular composition of fixed squares with through stitching (large square of fine cotton padded, each other isolated by stitching).</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The down is the most precious part of the goose plumage, a soft and light cluster, which ensures a perfect thermal insulation, keeps moisture under control and offers maximum comfort.</strong>  The down used for <strong>+me</strong> comes from geese raised for food purposes, in cold  countries such as Siberia, Canada, Greenland and North Eastern Europe (Hungary and Poland). These geese have a tick, soft and precious down that once arrived in Italy is subjected to washing, sterilization and finally deducted to be <strong>absolutely hypoallergenic</strong>, <strong>according to the highest standards and in compliance with national and European regulations and laws.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602506802/leqsdgprtwjkp4damtob.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The plumage of the geese is not always white, sometimes darker but guarantees the same thermal properties. Our products are not subjected to chemical bleaching so we tolerate the presence of few darker flakes to preserve the quality of the raw materials and your health. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>+me is made up fo large square of fine cotton</strong>. The square are isolated from each other through a seam to allow the padding to be distributed evenly, thus carrying out its thermoregulatory action with great effectiveness. The sheets are easily joined on the edges  and coupled by buttons.</p>
<p>Fabric of <strong>+me</strong> is made of cotton <strong>for three good reasons</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>soft, light, enveloping, relaxing, pleasant touch</li>
<li>high density mesh - 360 TC (Thread Count)</li>
<li>intense breathability and down retention</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602506894/vetunxbscwvif410elu2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>+me filling power is at least 750 Cuin</strong>. Higher Cuin, only possible with high quality goose down, means lower weight. <strong>What is the</strong> <strong>filling power</strong>? It is the ratio between weight and volume of the geese plumage and it is measured in cubic inches (CUIN).<strong> It</strong> <strong>is the product quality index</strong>. If the down is bulky and the weight is light, the filling power is higher. This is because the larger the down, the less they are needed to obtain the same volume needed to reach the desired heat levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can build and tear down your <strong>+me</strong> whenever you want according to your needs and climate changes. This is possible due to <strong>buttonholes and twin buttons. </strong>The gap between the assembled modules makes <strong>+me</strong> fully breathable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once the cold season is over storing the duvet is as important as using it. For this reason <strong>+me</strong> comes with an <strong>original breathable bag</strong>, which can be easily stored in the wardrobe or to bring it with you while traveling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601736111/utf5xbdbeg2hytpkldd9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How to compose +me</h3>
<p><strong>+me</strong> is modular to be customized by you, made up of panels with different insulation, which can be assembled using the friendly buttons provided.</p>

<p><strong>+me consists in 6 panels and 40 buttons</strong>. To compose <strong>+me</strong>, lay the panels on the mattress and unlock the buttons, separating the male from the female.</p>
<p>Insert the button with the tip (male) into the buttonholes from below, so that the button comes out of the buttonhole with the tip facing up.</p>

<h2>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h2>
<p><strong>+me is in the transition phase from prototype to production</strong>. We have completed the product development, prototyping and testing phase. We have selected the best suppliers to obtain a high quality and reliable duvet. </p>
<p>We made the modules structured in squares that will house the down goose of the duvet and we have found the ideal buttons to assemble the panels once completed.</p>
<p>We are read to carry out the second production phase, consisting in filling the modules with the precious geese down. This is the most capital intensive part of the project, requiring an investment of € 115.000.</p>
<p>We need to finance this phase and we have already found the raw material supplier and booked the quantity required so that we can promptly get it. In return, we offer <strong>+me</strong> at <strong>special price</strong> made available to Indiegogo members throughout this campaign.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Foundations for Divergent Minds is a Texas registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation based in Plano, TX. We are a small organization with a big mission to change the way all Autistic and other Neurodivergent children are supported in their homes, schools, communities and eventually their workplaces. Our model provides a framework to do that by focusing on five distinct but interconnected areas to enhance their quality of life.</p>
<p>While training is our primary means of achieving this goal, this campaign focuses on providing families with materials and tools in all five foundational areas. The Reimagined Home Kit does just that with sensory tools, routine cards, basic communication cards, social interaction bracelet and emotions cards.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Each kit comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>3-5 Fidgets</li>
<li>Sound dampening earmuffs</li>
<li>Routine cards, including morning, afternoon and evening routines </li>
<li>Waterproof card holders</li>
<li>Card notebook</li>
<li>Binder rings</li>
<li>Communication cards</li>
<li>Low Tech AAC bracelet</li>
<li>Silicone Interaction bracelet</li>
<li>Emotion and Feelings cards</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Are Helping</h3>
<p>By pledging to this campaign, you are not just getting a kit that will improve the life of a neurodivergent person. You are also helping us expand our educational content and services. As a small volunteer nonprofit, every dollar has a much greater impact as it is invested back into providing more to the public.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot pledge monetary support for this campaign, you can still help by sharing it with your family, friends, followers and other networks. </p>

<p>After hard work, we're happy to present you a powerful transport logistics system, which is capable to lift and to dump payloads with a max. weight of tremendous 80 tons and with lengths up to 18 m with <b>one</b> unit. To ensure a long durability and to withstand extreme tensions, the sturdy Rotating Lift Arm &amp; the Sliding Cart are made of wear resistant, high-tensile Steel DOMEX. The EOS-ContiLift CHU-40 is available as a prefabricated Mounting Kit for an easy self-assembling onto a locally provided semi-trailer chassis on site or fully fabricated with semi-trailer as one unit = Fit for Purpose !<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1456473367/zs4bh8pqsbcplqyu3kxn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>For the first time, it's possible to handle all transportation steps with one and the same device. Full or empty containers can be loaded by the EOS-ContiLift CHU-40 by itself without the necessity to wait for reach stackers, forklifts etc. Do it easily &amp; quickly by yourself without wasting time. And, if the container should be dumped by the solid tipping cylinder, you must not reload them to container tilters or to forklifts with rotator. Now, you can do all <b>with one unit in a shorter time !</b> <br/></p>

Yes, we've also listened to our potential users and the result is a convenient and safe transport system, which significantly eases the daily work of the driver/operator. With the EOS-ContiLift CHU-40 all necessary operations are executed by the strong hydraulics and are Radio Remote Controlled by the driver in the cab or in a safe distance near by. Due to the absence of chains, no manual actions of the operator are required and containers can be also safely handled during windy conditions. <br/><br/>Our modified ""Double T"" ISO Spreader connects automatically into the upper corner castings, whilst both 
corner castings at the bottom are embraced and closely locked by the hydraulically operated crossbar. To ensure absolute stability during dumping operations and to reduce stress on the chassis by loading, we've integrated 2 hydraulically driven Rear Roll Stabilizers to the undercarriage - giving you always the safety you need !<br/>

<p><b><i>The first Hook Lift for Waste Bins with 75 cbm Volume &amp; a Length of 12 m !</i></b></p>
<p>During the recent process of product development and due to demands, we've decided to lay out the EOS-ContiLift CHU-40 Range to a modular system - enabling us to fulfill easily our customer's requirements on a basic standard design. As a result, we engineered the strongest &amp; longest Hook Lift ever and can also answer customer's requests with the EOS-ContiLift CHU-40 COMBI or TBS 40 Version - equipped additionally with a hook device -, which can be also supplied as a straight Hook Lift TBS 40 only for Waste Bins with max. 75 cbm volume &amp; with 12 m !  <br/></p>
<p>Therefore, the Combined Heavy Duty Hook Lift Version TBS 40 is the first choice of enterprises requiring a versatile device for the trouble-free handling of 40'/45' Hook Lift Bins, Flat Racks, Rigs, Tank Containers, ISO Containers and for whatever you need it !</p>

</div></div>","> The newly developed, Self-Loading & Dumping

 EOS-ENVIRO ISO Container Handling Units ContiLift CHU-40 

truly represent a revolutionary design, 
which has great capabilities to change the market of transport logistics:

Capable to lift and to dump payloads - 
such as ISO-Containers & Hook Lift Bins - with a max. weight of tremendous 80 tons (!) 
and with telescopically extended lengths up to 18 mtrs. -, the Range CHU-40 is the first and only Hook 
Lift Device worldwide playing in this league and opening unexpected 
opportunities for your operations now, because for the first time, a 
Hook Lift Range is available on the markets for those payload weights 
and dimensions......


Be one of the first discovering the enormous advantages of the self-loading/unloading & dumping ISO Container Handling Unit ContiLift CHU-40 - designed for the trouble-free handling of 40' & 45' Containers, Flat Racks etc. Fast Loading & Unloading cycles of full/empty containers are possible now within only 45 seconds and you're ready to go on. This will boost your business - ultimately profit your operation !



After hard work, we're happy to present you a powerful transport logistics system, which is capable to lift and to dump payloads with a max. weight of tremendous 80 tons and with lengths up to 18 m with one unit. To ensure a long durability and to withstand extreme tensions, the sturdy Rotating Lift Arm & the Sliding Cart are made of wear resistant, high-tensile Steel DOMEX. The EOS-ContiLift CHU-40 is available as a prefabricated Mounting Kit for an easy self-assembling onto a locally provided semi-trailer chassis on site or fully fabricated with semi-trailer as one unit = Fit for Purpose !


For the first time, it's possible to handle all transportation steps with one and the same device. Full or empty containers can be loaded by the EOS-ContiLift CHU-40 by itself without the necessity to wait for reach stackers, forklifts etc. Do it easily & quickly by yourself without wasting time. And, if the container should be dumped by the solid tipping cylinder, you must not reload them to container tilters or to forklifts with rotator. Now, you can do all with one unit in a shorter time ! 




Yes, we've also listened to our potential users and the result is a convenient and safe transport system, which significantly eases the daily work of the driver/operator. With the EOS-ContiLift CHU-40 all necessary operations are executed by the strong hydraulics and are Radio Remote Controlled by the driver in the cab or in a safe distance near by. Due to the absence of chains, no manual actions of the operator are required and containers can be also safely handled during windy conditions. Our modified ""Double T"" ISO Spreader connects automatically into the upper corner castings, whilst both 
corner castings at the bottom are embraced and closely locked by the hydraulically operated crossbar. To ensure absolute stability during dumping operations and to reduce stress on the chassis by loading, we've integrated 2 hydraulically driven Rear Roll Stabilizers to the undercarriage - giving you always the safety you need !








The first Hook Lift for Waste Bins with 75 cbm Volume & a Length of 12 m !
During the recent process of product development and due to demands, we've decided to lay out the EOS-ContiLift CHU-40 Range to a modular system - enabling us to fulfill easily our customer's requirements on a basic standard design. As a result, we engineered the strongest & longest Hook Lift ever and can also answer customer's requests with the EOS-ContiLift CHU-40 COMBI or TBS 40 Version - equipped additionally with a hook device -, which can be also supplied as a straight Hook Lift TBS 40 only for Waste Bins with max. 75 cbm volume & with 12 m !  
Therefore, the Combined Heavy Duty Hook Lift Version TBS 40 is the first choice of enterprises requiring a versatile device for the trouble-free handling of 40'/45' Hook Lift Bins, Flat Racks, Rigs, Tank Containers, ISO Containers and for whatever you need it !

EOS-ENVIRO ISO Container Handling Units - Series ContiLift CHU-40 - are supplied serially
 with lifting function enabling the equipment to load and to unload full
 and/or empty 40' or - optionally - 45' ISO Containers within approx. 45
 seconds each. On request, the units are provided with an additional 
tipping cylinder, which allows also a fast emptying of bulk containers 
with a tipping angle of 45°.

The hinged ISO Container Spreader at the boom top 
section is forced to connect automatically with the upper sea 
container's corner castings by integrated locking pins whilst both 
corner castings at the bottom are embraced at first by the extended, 
hydraulically operated crossbar with locking pins and then safely 
connected to the Spreader - after retracting of the crossbar – by the 
automatically inserted locking pins.Extra long loads with a length of 13,716 mm/45' (by
 standard semi-trailer) or up to 18,000 mm (by hydraulically 
extendible/telescopic semi-trailer !) are also lifted and placed onto 
the ground safely and trouble-free, because no lateral lifting cranes 
(as seen at Sideloaders/Sidelifters) reduce the available payload width,
 which you require. 


By
 activating the rotating Extension Hook Arm with the hinged Crossbeam 
Spreader upwardly, the container is pulled by the Front Carriage onto the 
semi-trailer chassis and also simultaneously moved in the horizontal 
direction forwards - respectively for unloading in the opposite way.
 
By being fixedly mounted onto the Sliding Cart, the hydraulically operated, Rotating Lift Arm is moved forwards & backwards by the integrated belt drive - installed inside the semi-trailer skeleton. Either the prime mover's P.T.O. or an auxiliary Diesel engine supplies the necessary drive to operate the strong power unit beneath the chassis frame. 

During the dumping mode, the Front Carriage with Spreader, to which the payload is 
fixedly connected, is tilted max. 45° by a frontally installed hydraulic
 cylinder upwards in order to achieve a total emptying. Whilst tipping 
the ISO Containers are secured on the Foldable Rear Roller Bearings with twist locks and also by the front
 carriage to avoid an accidental release of the payloads.


During transport the ISO Containers are immovably 
connected to the Spreader and Twist Locks. Due to that stable fixation, 
payloads can be safely transported on rough terrain. 






The hydraulically operated Rear Roll Stabilizer makes
 the loading/unloading procedure safe by giving also stability on - a 
little bit - uneven ground during lifting and dumping of payloads, which
 is secured during transport with 4, integrated Twist Locks. Foldable Rear Roller Bearings on the left & right side of the rear ensure a smooth loading/unloading without jams. Equipped with twist locks & pins, the Rear Roller Bearings enable also a safe tilting by being folded upwards and whilst transportation in the horizontal position.

<p>My name is Khanh Bui, and by day I’m an Assay Development Scientist working at a biotech company in the San Francisco Bay Area. In my free time I’m an inventor, creating solutions to everyday problems, and I have several patents pending for my inventions. </p>
<p>I am humbled by your interest and say THANK YOU for your help!</p>
<p><b>The Inspiration</b></p>
<p>I developed the LidSitter in response to a dilemma that my wife and I faced working in a kitchen with limited countertop space. Following a recent back surgery, my wife’s mobility was limited. She wasn’t able to stand for long periods, turn from side to side, or move quickly in the kitchen. Cooking has always been a passion for my wife, even while living with chronic back pain. Because our house has a small kitchen with limited surface space, my wife has struggled to find places to put pot lids and tools while cooking. If she placed items on the stovetop, she risked burning herself when reaching for a lid or utensil. If she put a lid on the limited counter space, she inevitably covered up spices or knives that were then out of sight or steamed by a hot pot lid. If you’ve prepared a meal in a small kitchen, you’re familiar with this scene.</p>
<p><b>The Creative Process</b></p>
<p>Knowing my passion for inventive problem solving, my wife asked me to create a device to keep pot lids and ladles in easy reach, ideally on a pot’s rim. As I worked night after night on the design, I lost sleep and began engineering lid holders in my dreams. As it happened, early on an April morning in 2015, the current LidSitter design came to me in a dream that woke me from sleep. I got up at three in the morning, gathered my prototyping tools, and got to work. By morning I had a functional LidSitter!</p>
<p><b>Developing the LidSitter</b></p>
<p>Since that morning in April, I’ve invested thousands of dollars to secure IP and the support of an experienced engineer to work out 3D plans. After six months of investing my personal time and finances, we’ve created a solid design that is functional and affordable. I’ve researched the options, and I realize that I’ll have to bring the LidSitter to life on my own. After producing prototype batches, I’m now prepared to ask for your help to bring the LidSitter to market. Your financial support will fund the next stages of product and packaging design, website development, advertising, and securing distribution venues.</p>

Imagine your kitchen in the middle of meal preparation, with food ready to prep, kitchen tools, spices, and pot lids covering every inch. Where is that bit of extra space to put the cutting board to slice the veggies or for the bowl to mix the condiments? The LidSitter is here to help organize your kitchen space. LidSitter's unique design allows you to place lids, ladles, spoons, and other kitchen utensils securely on pot rims when not in use and quickly and easily place them back on the pots when the lids are needed.The LidSitter consists of a stainless steel wire-form and a nylon handle. One end of the wire-form design engages with the pot lid handle while the other snuggly attaches to the cooking pot’s rim. The LidSitter’s unique shape is fabricated from spring-steel that provides a secure attachment combined with flexible mobility. The spring-steel and nylon materials allow heat to dissipate from the device at a much faster rate than other metal surfaces, including the cooking pot and lid, ensuring that the LidSitter can be safely used on a gas stovetop.LidSitter Details

Scott was the president of several successful custom yacht design and manufacturing companies. Scott has used revolutionary construction technology to make some of the strongest, lightest, and most efficient modern nautical crafts on the market. He has also built military-grade boats used for special projects by the Navy Seals. </p><p> </p><h2><strong>GEO SHELTER’S STORY </strong></h2><p>In 2010, while he was developing ballistic panels that used different combinations and densities of materials, such as kevlar and carbon fiber, to build the reinforced Navy Seal boats, he saw the effects of the earthquake that devastated Haiti. As time went on and many disaster relief efforts by various institutions failed to efficiently aid the people affected by the earthquake, Scott came up with his latest and greatest venture, Geo Shelter, a concept for a quick-response shelter primarily intended for use in emergencies and for disaster relief. He saw the potential in  the material he using and took his experience in the construction of reinforced structures to design a shelter that could be a long-lasting response to the inevitable disasters that affect millions of people each year.  </p><p> </p><h2><strong>GEO SHELTER VS OUR COMPETITORS </strong></h2><p>Various concepts for disaster relief exist already, but what separates our design is that our structure is made up of  tessellating, triangular, extruded panels that interlock with simple joinery which requires no construction experience or tools to assemble. The panels are made from a rigid material that insulates the structure to protect its inhabitants from inclement weather. When fully assembled, the panels create a geodesic dome, which is scientifically proven to be the most structurally sound form in architectural design. It evenly distributes pressure and it has an absolute certainty of superior strength independent of extraneous structural supports. The form also has superior aerodynamic properties making it resistant to high-speed winds. Geodesic structures are actually encouraged for dwellings that are in areas prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, mudslides, and other such natural disasters. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477074563/eib1khffojdijkbjsz7a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477075423/ogx40waurxif1z7cudgu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h2><strong>ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS </strong></h2><p>Not only is our design beneficial for structural purposes, but it also has major environment benefits. The general shape allows for more efficient air circulation, in turn using only one-third of the energy needed to cool and heat similar sized dwellings. In the event that there is any damage caused to part of the dome, our patented design of interlocking panels makes it so that individual panels are easily and quickly replaced. In less than an hour, we can have a fully functional shelter again which is much more efficient than replacing an entire structure. Our design’s ability to disassemble and reassemble these domes to be reused many times over. The individual panels also allow us to create specialized domes. For example, solar panels installed on a Geo Shelter could collect renewable energy, while glass panels could make greenhouses designated for growing food, and solid panels made exclusively from our insulated material can make perfect climate controlled storage units for perishable items. The combinations of specialized panels are endless which not only makes our design effective, but extremely versatile. With a team of two people to assemble these domes, we can build a town that is essentially self-sustaining making our design by far the most eco-friendly solution to disaster relief to date.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477074603/wsb9vfvmdgexrfnkkxp2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h2><strong>SHIPPING </strong></h2><p>The entrance way doubles as a shipping container for the Geo Shelter. Since each panel is completely flat, they nest on top of each other creating no wasted space and allowing the Geo Shelter to be shipped with minimum space requirements. Shipping is one of the most vital aspects of the response time of disaster relief efforts. The kits take up a very small space and several of them could be shipped out from strategic locations around the globe in times of crisis. In comparison to the FEMA trailers commonly used by the United States government in times of crisis, 40 of our kits could take the place of one of their trailers. Our kits take up 16 sq ft of floor space; comparable to the amount of space that the average lawnmower takes up in a garage. When fully assembled our domes take up approximately 300 sq. ft of floor space, which is about 10 sq ft larger than the average FEMA trailer. There is little time to waste in times of crisis when response time can be a matter of life and death. </p><p> </p><h2><strong>STATISTICS </strong></h2><p> </p><ul>
<li>Worldwide, there are currently an estimated <strong><i>32.5 million</i></strong> people who need shelter or have been displaced due to the effects of war, poverty and/or natural disasters.</li>
<li>More than <strong><i>1.4 million</i></strong> Haitians are in need of temporary housing due to the effects of hurricane Matthew alone.</li>
<li>While the US government has taken a proactive role in finding a solution for these people, unfortunately, our average reaction time is <strong><i>45 days</i>.</strong>

Scott was the president of several successful custom yacht design and manufacturing companies. Scott has used revolutionary construction technology to make some of the strongest, lightest, and most efficient modern nautical crafts on the market. He has also built military-grade boats used for special projects by the Navy Seals.  GEO SHELTER’S STORY In 2010, while he was developing ballistic panels that used different combinations and densities of materials, such as kevlar and carbon fiber, to build the reinforced Navy Seal boats, he saw the effects of the earthquake that devastated Haiti. As time went on and many disaster relief efforts by various institutions failed to efficiently aid the people affected by the earthquake, Scott came up with his latest and greatest venture, Geo Shelter, a concept for a quick-response shelter primarily intended for use in emergencies and for disaster relief. He saw the potential in  the material he using and took his experience in the construction of reinforced structures to design a shelter that could be a long-lasting response to the inevitable disasters that affect millions of people each year.   GEO SHELTER VS OUR COMPETITORS Various concepts for disaster relief exist already, but what separates our design is that our structure is made up of  tessellating, triangular, extruded panels that interlock with simple joinery which requires no construction experience or tools to assemble. The panels are made from a rigid material that insulates the structure to protect its inhabitants from inclement weather. When fully assembled, the panels create a geodesic dome, which is scientifically proven to be the most structurally sound form in architectural design. It evenly distributes pressure and it has an absolute certainty of superior strength independent of extraneous structural supports. The form also has superior aerodynamic properties making it resistant to high-speed winds. Geodesic structures are actually encouraged for dwellings that are in areas prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, mudslides, and other such natural disasters.  ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS Not only is our design beneficial for structural purposes, but it also has major environment benefits. The general shape allows for more efficient air circulation, in turn using only one-third of the energy needed to cool and heat similar sized dwellings. In the event that there is any damage caused to part of the dome, our patented design of interlocking panels makes it so that individual panels are easily and quickly replaced. In less than an hour, we can have a fully functional shelter again which is much more efficient than replacing an entire structure. Our design’s ability to disassemble and reassemble these domes to be reused many times over. The individual panels also allow us to create specialized domes. For example, solar panels installed on a Geo Shelter could collect renewable energy, while glass panels could make greenhouses designated for growing food, and solid panels made exclusively from our insulated material can make perfect climate controlled storage units for perishable items. The combinations of specialized panels are endless which not only makes our design effective, but extremely versatile. With a team of two people to assemble these domes, we can build a town that is essentially self-sustaining making our design by far the most eco-friendly solution to disaster relief to date.   SHIPPING The entrance way doubles as a shipping container for the Geo Shelter. Since each panel is completely flat, they nest on top of each other creating no wasted space and allowing the Geo Shelter to be shipped with minimum space requirements. Shipping is one of the most vital aspects of the response time of disaster relief efforts. The kits take up a very small space and several of them could be shipped out from strategic locations around the globe in times of crisis. In comparison to the FEMA trailers commonly used by the United States government in times of crisis, 40 of our kits could take the place of one of their trailers. Our kits take up 16 sq ft of floor space; comparable to the amount of space that the average lawnmower takes up in a garage. When fully assembled our domes take up approximately 300 sq. ft of floor space, which is about 10 sq ft larger than the average FEMA trailer. There is little time to waste in times of crisis when response time can be a matter of life and death.  STATISTICS  
Worldwide, there are currently an estimated 32.5 million people who need shelter or have been displaced due to the effects of war, poverty and/or natural disasters.
More than 1.4 million Haitians are in need of temporary housing due to the effects of hurricane Matthew alone.
While the US government has taken a proactive role in finding a solution for these people, unfortunately, our average reaction time is 45 days.

A human can survive for 3 days without water, 21 days without food, but without proper shelter, it is possible that they could not survive for one 12-hour period.
 There is no time to waste in times of crisis when response time can be a matter of life and death! People need quick and effective solutions in their times of crisis. Entire families are left in desperate need of shelter and medical attention while they wait for government aid. OUR OBJECTIVE & WHAT WE NEED At Geo Shelter, our objective is to respond to people in need swiftly with our comprehensive design. We need your support to reach our goal of $30,000 to complete a working prototype of our structure.  Here is a breakdown of how we would use your $30,000 of contribution in order to bring this product to life: 
$2500 would go to the materials needed for a working prototype 
$3500 would go to the labor of creating this prototype

$2500 would go to the development of our website
$4500 would go to marketing costs (per month for 2 months) 
$10,000 would be used to grow our team to make this concept into a fully functioning company
With your help, we can make a working prototype of our patented interlocking panel design we can boost interest and investment in our project, which will help millions upon millions of people in need of housing each year.

Our revolutionary 4-in-1 technology provides vacuum, sweep, mop, and self rinse functions in one innovative robot. At the touch of a button, TECBOT M1 does it all. Simple, automatic, and convenient.  A sensor monitors the condition of the mop. It triggers an automated self rinse whenever necessary, ensuring that the mop pad is always clean and preventing contamination of the previously cleaned floor areas. Less effort, less worry!  Unlike the previous generation of robots with mop functions that required manual cleaning of the dirty mop pad, TECBOT M1 has a self rinse function that uses high-pressure water to maintain a clean mop head as it moves across the floor without returning to its base. More intelligent, more versatile, more effective!  TECBOT M1 has a unique feature that automatically lifts the mop roller when it moves from the floor to a carpeted area, preventing wetting your carpet. The mop will also lift when finished mopping and while returning to its base. It will not repeat the previously cleaned areas.  There are several modes to choose from via the app: Sweep, Mop, Heavy Mop or combine them all! The app makes it easy to select that mode that fits your unique cleaning needs.  TECBOT M1 has twice as much suction power as any typical robot vacuum on the market. Powered by a 30,000 RPM brushless motor, TECBOT M1 pulls out deeply embedded dust and dirt from your floors and carpets in one pass.  Efficiently sweep dirt and pet hair without entangling itself. Brushes adjust and flex to stay in constant contact with carpets and hardwood floors, capturing 99% of cat and dog hair—an ideal function for pet owners.  TECBOT M1 comes with an industry-leading LDS (laser navigation system) with a built-in SLAM algorithm; the floor scanning and mapping are accurate, detailed, and completed in seconds. TECBOT M1 will analyze the floor conditions in real-time and adapt to optimize routes for an efficient coverage area with a row by row cleaning path.  TECBOT M1 has built-in advanced smart sensors to map your rooms and clean them better.

Therefore, the first objective was to make the clothing hanger more sustainable. Through extensive research, bamboo and wheat straw were determined to be extremely promising materials. Bamboo is one of the most sustainable materials on the planet, and wheat straw is a strong and economical bioplastic that is made of 40% renewable content, making both materials ideal for an eco-friendly hanger.</p><p>The second objective was to identify a problem with conventional clothing hangers and solve it. The problem we chose was the stretching of tight-necked shirts and collars. By incorporating a notch into the body of the hanger, shirts could be slid past the center-point and removed with ease. This simple but highly effective solution eliminates the stretching of collars and allows for the hanging and removal of most buttoned shirts, even with top buttons buttoned. The design of the notch is so effective that it works on baby clothes as well.</p><p>Through refinement, prototypes, and evaluations, our design became what is now known as the Mozu Hanger, a beautifully designed, slim, eco-friendly hanger that revolutionizes the way you hang your clothes. “Mozu” (pronounced moh-zoo) is a modification of the word “Moso,” which is the species of bamboo most commonly used for manufacturing. We are excited to introduce the patented Mozu Hanger, and we hope that everyone will appreciate its beauty, functionality, and sustainability as much as we do! </p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p><p>We have an overseas manufacturer lined up for production, and the injection molding tooling has already been made. Production samples in both wheat straw and bamboo have already been received and approved. As always, the project timeline is estimated. Any delays in production, shipping, customs, or fulfillment will shift the timeline to the right, which of course can result in delays. COVID-19 has had a significant global impact on both manufacturing and logistics, which we have done our best to account for in our estimates.

The hanger is made from 40% renewable wheat straw material, an agricultural bi-product, making it a great alternative to conventional plastics.*Please note that the premium bamboo Mozu Hangers are no longer availableConventional plastic hangers are cheap and very flimsy, whereas the Mozu Hangers are strong and durable enough to last a lifetime. The design of the Mozu Hanger offers a variety of features to make your life easier, and it is so unique that we were awarded a US Patent.The Mozu Hanger is approximately 16.2” long and 8.1"" tall, and is about 0.23″ thick at the top and 0.17″ thick at the bottom. The notch-to-shoulder length is about 6.875” long.*Please note that the premium bamboo Mozu Hangers are no longer availableChildhood friends Tim Lee and Michael Graham teamed up to pursue their lifelong dream of starting a design company together, which they named Ensu Design. They leveraged their backgrounds in design and engineering and set off to redesign everyday products by incorporating beautiful design, innovative functionality, and environmental consciousness. The Mozu Hanger is the first embodiment of their design philosophy.Timothy Lee – Engineer + Co-Creator   After earning degrees in mechanical engineering from Columbia and the University of Washington, Tim spent several years in the aerospace and automotive industries as an engineer and fabricator. Now, he is a proud military spouse and stay-at-home dad by day and a technology consultant and product development engineer by night. He’s passionate about innovation and holds five patents (additional pending), and he recently earned his EMBA from Quantic.Michael Graham – Designer + Co-Creator   Since studying industrial and graphic design at the Art Institute, Michael has been a graphic designer and art director for several top media and marketing companies as well as for an international fine minerals dealer. He was also a topographic analyst in the United States Army, with two combat tours to Iraq. He is a proud father, and he is passionate about design.Although the Mozu Hanger was originally intended to be an internal test project and nothing more, its functionality and simplicity proved to be so inspiring that we decided to bring it to market.The problem statement was simple: plastic hangers are primarily made from petroleum, and they typically end up in landfills. Therefore, the first objective was to make the clothing hanger more sustainable. Through extensive research, bamboo and wheat straw were determined to be extremely promising materials. Bamboo is one of the most sustainable materials on the planet, and wheat straw is a strong and economical bioplastic that is made of 40% renewable content, making both materials ideal for an eco-friendly hanger.The second objective was to identify a problem with conventional clothing hangers and solve it. The problem we chose was the stretching of tight-necked shirts and collars. By incorporating a notch into the body of the hanger, shirts could be slid past the center-point and removed with ease. This simple but highly effective solution eliminates the stretching of collars and allows for the hanging and removal of most buttoned shirts, even with top buttons buttoned. The design of the notch is so effective that it works on baby clothes as well.Through refinement, prototypes, and evaluations, our design became what is now known as the Mozu Hanger, a beautifully designed, slim, eco-friendly hanger that revolutionizes the way you hang your clothes. “Mozu” (pronounced moh-zoo) is a modification of the word “Moso,” which is the species of bamboo most commonly used for manufacturing. We are excited to introduce the patented Mozu Hanger, and we hope that everyone will appreciate its beauty, functionality, and sustainability as much as we do!  Risks and challengesWe have an overseas manufacturer lined up for production, and the injection molding tooling has already been made. Production samples in both wheat straw and bamboo have already been received and approved. As always, the project timeline is estimated. Any delays in production, shipping, customs, or fulfillment will shift the timeline to the right, which of course can result in delays. COVID-19 has had a significant global impact on both manufacturing and logistics, which we have done our best to account for in our estimates. Of course, we will continue to keep you posted as everything happens. Environmental commitmentsLONG-LASTING DESIGNUsing high-quality, durable materials and designs.REUSABILITY AND RECYCLABILITYUsing highly renewable materials and agricultural bi-products, and using minimal, recyclable packaging materials.SUSTAINABLE MATERIALSWheat straw (40% renewable material, agricultural bi-product)",26.0,2,"1 Campaign

And on top of that, we were not able to find the perfect sized tray for us. That is why we developed EL DINE - trays that can be used for any food portion, whether baby food, sauces, soups, meals, ice cubes or even cakes, with us everyone finds his lid.
 

 
Mission in a Tray

In average, a single household uses 50 freezing bags per a year. Calculated to Switzerland with a total of 3.6 Mio. households, thats 180 million bags per year.
That has to sink in a little!
Close to our heart is the trillion trees joint venture which protects, restores and end deforestation. And we want to pay forward to protect this beautiful world.

<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>The Landholder Solar House is 100% solar powered and is, what we like to call it an active house. It is a new type of smart home where everything has multiple functions. This kind of houses would help people towards more sustainable way of living and reduce the cost of energy.<br/>The concept house is created with years of close observation considering and understanding that the way we have built houses over the last decades is no more fully satisfying.  <br/>The prototype was finished in 2011 and following years were used for testing. This  house has gone through testing and taught us a lot about building and setting up the house.<br/><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h2><b><b>The Form</b></b></h2>
<b>
<h3></h3></b><p></p>
<p>The form of the house has been developed based on the idea of building from inside to the outside. Outside is a guarding space and holding the house together but inside is the space for living. The sphere has the smallest surface area of all surfaces that enclose a given volume, and it encloses the largest volume among all closed surfaces with a given surface area. </p></span></h3><h2><b>The Idea</b></h2><h3></h3><p>The prototype house for testing is engineered by Tõnis Kasemägi, and we love it! The idea was born in early 2005. Development took few years before the building began. In 2011 the prototype was ready and since then there has been a frequent interest in this project. The prototype has been featured in Estonian TV and Estonian design papers.</p><p>Until today Tõnis Kasemägi has used his personal funds to bring the Landholder Solar House into existence. In order to start manufacturing further steps need to be taken.</p><p>Our dream is to produce different models and scales of solar houses, which can take off the pressures of having have to worry about the energy need. This house can function in synthesis with nature and help this world to ease the need of fossil fuels.</p><p>With current technology, we can make different modifications of solar houses. The houses can be used as singular off grid or on grid houses, but also can be set up as groups of solar houses. For example, to the prototype sphere section another spere can be added. This doubles the amount of solar panels and the living space.</p><h2><b>What does this house do?</b></h2><h3></h3><p>Current prototype has 24 solar panels on its outer wall. The solar panels are hooked to 24 batteries which are located in the prism section (garage). This can provide 48h worth of energy when it is pitch black outside.

Landholder Solar House Facebook


Intro
The Landholder Solar House is 100% solar powered and is, what we like to call it an active house. It is a new type of smart home where everything has multiple functions. This kind of houses would help people towards more sustainable way of living and reduce the cost of energy.The concept house is created with years of close observation considering and understanding that the way we have built houses over the last decades is no more fully satisfying.  The prototype was finished in 2011 and following years were used for testing. This  house has gone through testing and taught us a lot about building and setting up the house.

The Form


The form of the house has been developed based on the idea of building from inside to the outside. Outside is a guarding space and holding the house together but inside is the space for living. The sphere has the smallest surface area of all surfaces that enclose a given volume, and it encloses the largest volume among all closed surfaces with a given surface area. The IdeaThe prototype house for testing is engineered by Tõnis Kasemägi, and we love it! The idea was born in early 2005. Development took few years before the building began. In 2011 the prototype was ready and since then there has been a frequent interest in this project. The prototype has been featured in Estonian TV and Estonian design papers.Until today Tõnis Kasemägi has used his personal funds to bring the Landholder Solar House into existence. In order to start manufacturing further steps need to be taken.Our dream is to produce different models and scales of solar houses, which can take off the pressures of having have to worry about the energy need. This house can function in synthesis with nature and help this world to ease the need of fossil fuels.With current technology, we can make different modifications of solar houses. The houses can be used as singular off grid or on grid houses, but also can be set up as groups of solar houses. For example, to the prototype sphere section another spere can be added. This doubles the amount of solar panels and the living space.What does this house do?Current prototype has 24 solar panels on its outer wall. The solar panels are hooked to 24 batteries which are located in the prism section (garage). This can provide 48h worth of energy when it is pitch black outside. The solar panels obtain energy from the early morning sun until the very last rays of light.We live in a four season country Estonia, which means during the three winter months the solar energy levels are lower. During that period of time the energy can be bought from local electrical company or produced by a generator. During the summer the excessive energy can be sold.Building one house takes 5 men, 2 trucks, 1 month and est. 150 000-200 000 eur (prices can range depending on extras)This current prototype has one bedroom, 2 bathrooms (one with shower room), sauna, living room/kitchen area, garage, storage room. (Possibility to add extra bedroom and office)Why do we need you?So far this house has been one man's solo project but in order to start manufacturing this type of houses we need to hire staff to get the house production read and to coach the team of builders. Since the particular house was finished in 2011  we have had a lot of new inspiration and ideas in order to bring this house up to date.Bringing this project to life would mean that this kind of houses would be available for people to purchase and therefore help the world towards more sustainable path and way of living, and also enjoy the luxury of not worrying about the cost of energy.Funds go towards getting this house production ready. We need to map out the line of how we work, updating the house with most recent technology and materials.We need to figure out most economical way to produce the houses in order to manufacture and to bring the cost of the houses down.For under 100 000 we will seek professional help, to gather a team and find passionate people to take the next steps to move forwards. Also find investors and make promo models.Over 100 000 we will finalize one Solar House and get it production ready.500 000 we will make the variations of Solar Houses production ready and will start pre selling limited amount of houses.1 000 000 We will make custom version of our Solar House so every person can custom Solar House for their personal needs. This also allows us to produce houses with lower cost.2 000 000 We will get the price even lower and start manufacturing as soon as the house gets  production ready. We will make 7 versions of the house and lower the costs of building abroad. Also we will make a custom version of the house which you can add to your current house. Also our final  goal includes special edition house, which is transportable via helicopter to places cars cannot reach, in order to make off grid living possibility where it has not been before.Who are we?We are Tõnis Kasemägi and Taavi Kasemägi, father and son. Our aim is to bring the manufacturing of solar houses to reality. Tõnis Kasemägi has funded the building of a prototype and personally observed the last 4 years, therefore we would like to point out that this a project very close to our hearts.

<p>Cooking meat with complex structures as fat marbling and fibres is really challenging using regular thermometers, especially as the meat changes shape during the cooking time.

<p>The CookPerfect Intelligent Meat Thermometer makes it simple to cook these types of meat to perfection. Simply place the thermometer in the meat, close the grill and wait for the App's message that the meat is ready to be served. </p>

<p>The CookPerfect meat thermometer work with Grills, Ovens and Smokers. It can also be used to cook small cuts of meat on you Pan to perfection. Furthermore the CookPerfect works with 2 thermometers, thus you perfectly can cook to type of meats.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How does the CookPerfect Intelligent Meat Thermometer work?</h2>
<p><strong>The secret is a specially developed algorithm (mathematically calculation)</strong></p>
<p>In order to get good cooking results you need to control the meats core temperature. </p>
<p>The meats cooking temperature equals the core temperature (the coldest spot in the meat) – so to achieve a good cooking result it is essential to measure the core temperature of the meat correctly.</p>
<p>Usually, when you place a regular thermometer in the meat, the temperature is only measured at the tip of the thermometer. Therefore you need to be sure to place it precisely in the core of the meat. This is something you cannot determine before the cooking process begins due to the meat's complexity. If you cannot guarantee measuring the core (the coldest spot) you cannot guarantee to be in control of the core temperature.</p>
<p>Measuring the core temperature is thereby a complicated process. In fact, <strong>missing the core by one centimeter can result in a difference of 10 degrees </strong>Celcius, and there is a world of difference between 54 and 64 degrees Celcius – the difference between medium rare and medium done.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508696951/k3w3ywsz2hpahriryxm6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>What makes the CookPerfect Intelligent Meat Thermometer so unique is how the thermometer measures the temperature in up to five places in the meat and then mathematically calculates the core temperature, You are thereby not dependent on a precise placement of the thermometer in the meat's core as the core temperature will be calculated regardless of the placement. Thereby you will always be guaranteed measurement of the core temperature.</p>
<p>When knowing the meats core temperature our special developed algorithm also inform you when the meat will be finished and ready to be served based on the settings you chose in the accompanying app. <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>What differentiates the CookPerfect Intelligent Meat Thermometer from other regular meat thermometers?</strong></p>
<p>- The CookPerfect Intelligent Meat Thermometer measures the temperature of meat in five different places, providing the data for our algorithm which uses mathematical calculations to determine the meat’s core temperature. Other regular meat thermometers only measure temperature at the tip of the thermometer. Therefore, you are completely reliant on getting other regular thermometers positioned at the exact centre of the meat, whereas this does not really matter with the CookPerfect Intelligent Meat Thermometer.</p>
<p><strong>How can you be so sure to get the core temperature right?</strong></p>
<p>- We have developed an algorithm which uses five measuring points to calculate the coldest point in the meat (the core temperature). Just make sure to insert the thermometer through the centre of the meat.</p>
<p><strong>Can the CookPerfect tell me when the meat will be done?</strong></p>
<p>- Yes. Using the accompanying app, set your targeted cooking temperature (e.g. 54 degrees Celcius), press ""start"" on the app and after 5 minutes our algorithm will tell you when the meat reaches 54 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if the grill’s temperature changes?</strong></p>
<p>- Our algorithm continuously calculates the time needed to cook the meat. This means that if the grill’s temperature changes, cooking time will adjust accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>How many pieces of meat can I measure simultaneously with the CookPerfect?</strong></p>
<p>- You can measure two pieces of meat simultaneously – using two different thermometers – and follow them simultaneously in the app.</p>
<p><strong>Can the CookPerfect be used in all kinds of meat?</strong></p>
<p>- Yes</p>
<p><strong>Can the CookPerfect work on smaller cuts of meat if the probe isn't fully inserted?</strong></p>
<p>- The meat would have to be quite thin if it is not possible to place the CookPerfect Intelligent Meat Thermometer properly into the meat to calculate the meats core temperature.</p>
<p>If that is the case, like a chicken fillet or thin steak, then you can place it horizontally like you would do with other regular thermometers and it will work as you would expect.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For all the ways that technology has improved our lives over the last couple of decades, it has created in our lives a giant vacuum, a dependency that we too often find ourselves unable to escape. The thing is, we can only really escape this dependency by giving it up completely. What does that mean? To start with, it means we need to abandon the Internet when it comes to our most crucial systems, chief among them our security systems. Yes, if we want our security systems to be as efficient as possible, we need to do something counterintuitive: we need to take them offline.</p>
<p>By taking a security system offline, you save money and avoid a reliance upon an Internet connection. Balert is a security system that does just that, running off a 12-volt power supply, requiring no Internet connection, and consuming less than 10 milliamperes of power to keep your home, your office, your shop, or any other property totally secure.</p>
<p>Balert is incredibly simple to install, taking around three minutes and costing just $ 59, which includes worldwide shipping charges.</p>
<p>Unlike other CCTV security systems that take a full day to install, huge money to maintain, and upwards of $200 to start, Balert is compact and affordable. Save money <i>without</i> sacrificing any functionality.  </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
For all the ways that technology has improved our lives over the last couple of decades, it has created in our lives a giant vacuum, a dependency that we too often find ourselves unable to escape. The thing is, we can only really escape this dependency by giving it up completely. What does that mean? To start with, it means we need to abandon the Internet when it comes to our most crucial systems, chief among them our security systems. Yes, if we want our security systems to be as efficient as possible, we need to do something counterintuitive: we need to take them offline.
By taking a security system offline, you save money and avoid a reliance upon an Internet connection. Balert is a security system that does just that, running off a 12-volt power supply, requiring no Internet connection, and consuming less than 10 milliamperes of power to keep your home, your office, your shop, or any other property totally secure.
Balert is incredibly simple to install, taking around three minutes and costing just $ 59, which includes worldwide shipping charges.
Unlike other CCTV security systems that take a full day to install, huge money to maintain, and upwards of $200 to start, Balert is compact and affordable. Save money without sacrificing any functionality.

<p><u><strong>Short Summary</strong></u></p>
<p>Rentie started after Chris Schlierman, Co-Founder and CEO, moved to Utah from Los Angeles in December 2016 and couldn’t find a place to live. In Los Angeles there was a website that had built the brand of trust with tenants and landlords called Westside Rentals. Chris always used that site and when he moved to Utah he couldn’t find a single site that had even half the same brand trust or listings. From there the idea was planted and after months of market research to learn and understand the housing industry Chris linked up with his roommate Christian Lambert, his friend from LA, Shane Duggan, and his cousin Danny deLeon to build Rentie: the product that landlords and tenants can actually trust. Our site allows you to connect with landlords and sellers of contracts seamlessly to go from searching to sold within minutes.</p>

<p>The primary risks for Rentie right now are refining our product and scaling our technologies to meet rising demand. Our development team has researched what we need to do to make sure we can scale. We've got the strategies necessary for this, but we need funds to be able to have the time and talent to move forward with scaling our product. While we haven't done this kind of scaling before, we are confident that we can learn what we need to, and we are confident we can expand our engineering team to fill in any remaining skill gaps.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Rentie started after Chris Schlierman, Co-Founder and CEO, moved to Utah from Los Angeles in December 2016 and couldn’t find a place to live. In Los Angeles there was a website that had built the brand of trust with tenants and landlords called Westside Rentals. Chris always used that site and when he moved to Utah he couldn’t find a single site that had even half the same brand trust or listings. From there the idea was planted and after months of market research to learn and understand the housing industry Chris linked up with his roommate Christian Lambert, his friend from LA, Shane Duggan, and his cousin Danny deLeon to build Rentie: the product that landlords and tenants can actually trust. Our site allows you to connect with landlords and sellers of contracts seamlessly to go from searching to sold within minutes.

</div></div>","Undoubtedly the story of Detroit parallels the story of Philetus W. Norris.The hustle and the entrepreneurial spirit. Creating something basically from nothing but hard work and true grit. Celebrating the Wins and rolling with Busts. Seeker of knowledge, a poet, and Storyteller.But there is little left to us tell of his story 150 years later. And one of those things is the house he built.Constructed in 1873 by Norris, who went on to become the second superintendent of Yellowstone National Park. Norris founded the town of ""Norris"" (later ""North Detroit"" aka Nortown) and built his house there. The town was later annexed into the city of Detroit; Norris's house is one of the few original structures left in the area.However this house is on the brink destruction and without preserving what is left, Mr. Norris comes closer to being lost to obscurity.Supporters and defenders of Norris’ legacy have organized together to help save this house. We are asking for assistance to make the first steps to raise funds to repair the roof, shore structural damage from a partial structure fire, and do basic landscaping to alleviate blight.Doing this will stave off losing of the registered historical status and in turn prevent the building from being demolished.$51.230.00  is needed in order to do the following:

Roof: $43,200 ( Constractor 2008 Estimate, adjusted for inflation via http://data.bls.gov.)


Structure Fire Abatement: $7,500.00 (Nortown CDC 2015 Estimate.)

Landscaping “Decorative Border”: $530.00 (Nortown CDC 2015 Estimate.)
Please help us raise the funds to save this historical residence.Perhaps, with your support, The Philetus W. Norris House Historical District will continue to embody that Detroit Spirit, such as embodied in the City of Detroit’s Great Seal has Latin the motto meaning ""We hope for better things"" and ""It will rise from the ashes"".Supporters can also donate directly by mailing to:ATTN: Norris House RestorationNortown CDCP.O.

<p><strong>Isn't it ironic that most recycling bins are made of oil based plastic and brushed aluminium?  Why do something that's good for our planet like recycling using something that isn’t?  Your dwiss is made of wood grown in responsibly managed forests, its durable design means it will last and last, and at the end of a long and happy life it can be recycled - all good!</strong></p>
<p><strong>It has 4 large compartments, including 1 that can be discreetly fitted with a bag for trash so you don't need a separate unit.  The other 3 compartments give flexible recycling options, with 1 having a removable tub suitable for composting.  Just decide what goes where and #reclaimyourworktops</strong></p>
<p><strong>People that trialled the dwiss refused to return them because they were so happy to have clear worktops again!</strong></p>

Features & Benefits

The story so far...
Isn't it ironic that most recycling bins are made of oil based plastic and brushed aluminium?  Why do something that's good for our planet like recycling using something that isn’t?  Your dwiss is made of wood grown in responsibly managed forests, its durable design means it will last and last, and at the end of a long and happy life it can be recycled - all good!
It has 4 large compartments, including 1 that can be discreetly fitted with a bag for trash so you don't need a separate unit.  The other 3 compartments give flexible recycling options, with 1 having a removable tub suitable for composting.  Just decide what goes where and #reclaimyourworktops
People that trialled the dwiss refused to return them because they were so happy to have clear worktops again!
 

 
The dwiss' innovative 'frame and compartment' design provides more capacity than is currently available on the market and it’s super easy to keep clean - the bottom of all 4 compartments can be easily reached and the tub is safe to go in the dishwasher.  It's also easy to empty each compartment, the bottom two can be removed and carried in one hand, leaving the other hand free to open the door when taking the recycling out for collection.  And for peace of mind your dwiss is laser engraved on the rear with a serial number so we can provide first class customer service over the years to come.
We are asking for your help to fund our first large scale production run.  Your donations will also enable us to develop a low cost version of the dwiss made of recycled material, and which can be used on a scale where we'll significantly reduce the amount of waste ending up in landfill and in our seas.
If you're quick you can snap up a dwiss at up to 40% off the regular price!

This didactic toy is more than just a toy. In production, natural materials were used, with no harmful chemicals, and every part of this toy was hand-made and polished with natural bee wax.
Hand-made cube made of real wood with two pieces of plexiglass that transmit LED lights embedded in the cube. The cube is illuminated when the square-man is inserted.
You can select two types of the cube: Ash and Cherry, Ash and Walnut.
