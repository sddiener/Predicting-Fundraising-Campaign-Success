<h3>Breve Sommario</h3>
<p>Cagliostro E-Press è un'associazione culturale che ah come scopo principale quello di scoprire e avviare alla professione del fumettista nuovi talenti, una ""bottega editoriale"", dove un gruppo di appassionati di fumetto con alle spalle tanti anni di esperienza, sforna progetti collettivi per far debuttare le nuove leve del fumetto italiano e internazionale. Paolo Zeccardo è uno di questi: ha debuttato con noi nel 2007 con la miniserie Gravetowne  oggi è un autore professionista con varie pubblicazioni all'attivo e un'insegnante delle Scuola Internazionale di Comics sede di Roma.</p>
<ul>
<li>La campagna che stiamo lanciando ci permetterà di ridare alle stampe la sua opera di debutto, esaurita da anni  e tutt'ora ricercata. Allo stesso tempo permetterà a Cagliostro di finanziare nuovi progetti e nuove attività volti a scoprire e valorizzare altri giovani talenti come Paolo.</li>
<li>Questo sostanzialmente è quello che ci aiuterete a realizzare: una nuova stupenda edizione, apmpliata e corretta, di Gravetown, in <strong>un unico volume omnibus di 360 pagine (formato 17x24 cm)</strong>, riconoscere ulteriori benefici economici a Paolo e raccogliere altre risorse per finanziare nuovi progetti.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Cosa ci serve e cosa avrete in cambio</h3>
<p>qualche dettaglio:</p>
<ul>
<li>L'obiettivo è raccogliere 2000 euro che saranno così ripartiti: 500 euro circa per la stampa  del volume in questione; 500 euro di riconoscimento economico per l'autore; 1000 euro per le spese di spedizione, redazione, attività promozionali, ecc...</li>
<li>Quello che vi offriamo sono: la nostra gratitudine per condividere e sostenere l'iniziativa; il volume contenente l'intera miniserie, il capitolo aggiuntivo e extra vari; la possibilità di avere la copia del volume con un disegno originale di Paolo; la copia del volume con un'illustrazione a colori e per finire, una copia del volume con una tavola originale a scelta tra le 5 (si, solo 5 potranno averla) messe a disposizione da Paolo</li>
<li>La campagna sarà di tipo flessibile, perciò produrremo quanto necessario per soddisfare le richieste dei sostenitori.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>A questo punto non ci resta che invitarvi a sostenere la nostra iniziativa, condividendola sui social media che frequentate, sui form, blog, al bar e con gli amici: solo così potremo raggiungere il nostro obiettivo, modesto in termini assoluti ma, grande per noi e per tutte quelle persone che potremo seguire e avviare alla professione di fumettista!</p>

It is a kick ass pirate story that has something profound, rich and worthy of your attention.

<p class=""standard0"">Waiting for death to watch the movie of his life, Golden Beard, a famous pirate, bypasses the queue leading to the final judgment. He requests to be immediately redirected to earth; his sailors are caught in a brawl and he must save them, as well as his honor. Death, who is a joyful little girl spending the most of her time playing and trying to escape the exercise of her functions, notices the pirate and takes him into her spooky gardens to drink tea with other famous historical characters such as Hitler, Ghandi and Napoleon. She will play with him like a toy, which will bring the pirate to criticize her existence. This highlights the truths of the meaningless life she leads and destabilizes her profoundly. Death then accepts to make the captain discover the intricacies of her mysterious and dark world, while continuing to play with him like a toy.</p>
<p class=""standard0"">She will then offer the captain a deal: restoring his life and giving him a well-stocked ship in exchange of stories of his adventures written in a book as well as the promise to retrace her origins. Death then warns him; stories must be exquisite because what pushes punishment only waits for deeper punishment!</p>

<p class=""standard0""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Main Themes</span></strong></p>
<p class=""standard0"">Golden Beard is a suspense, action and gore comic-book filled with dark humor that explores different themes as : animality vs humanity, anarchism vs capitalism, time and money slipping, revolution, fair sharing, environnement,</p>
<p class=""standard0"">Its the story of Death not knowing where she comes from, even though she watches everybody's movie of life with them after death. It is the story of Death and life being twin sisters that hate each other.</p>
<p class=""standard0"">It is the story of gods being bankers of time in a recession. A story that brings us all to question ourselves on our origins through death trying to humanize itself. Ironicaly, it is the story of a pirate Captain being prisoner in his will for complete freedom.</p>

<p>C’est pour ça qu’on a besoin de vous! La campagne IndieGogo nous sert à amasser des fonds afin de couvrir les coûts d’illustration, de couleur et d’impression. Ces fonds vont aussi nous permettre de signer un contrat de distribution avec un distributeur majeur. Le projet sera basé à Montréal avec des collaborateurs venant des 4 coins du globe.</p>
<p>Golden Beard (Barbe Or) est une histoire sur laquelle nous travaillons depuis plusieurs années qui mérite d’être racontée avec des dessins et de la musique. C’est une histoire « à vous botter le cul » qui a quelque chose de profond, de riche et qui mérite votre précieuse attention.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">L’Histoire</span></strong></p>
<p class=""standard0"">En attendant que la mort regarde le film de sa vie, Barbe Or, un pirate de renom, court-circuite la file menant au jugement dernier. Il demande d’être réexpédié sur terre car ses marins sont pris dans une escarmouche et il doit les sauver ainsi que son honneur. La mort, une jolie petite fille passant la majorité de son temps à échapper à l’exercice de ses fonctions, prends d’affection le pirate et l’invite à entrer dans son univers fantasmagorique. Elle jouera avec l’ours en peluche dans son salon de thé avec des personnages historiques connus : Hitler, Gandhi, Napoléon etc. Au fil du temps, le Pirate réussiras à toucher les cordes sensibles de la mort; mettant le doigt sur l’incapacité de celle-ci à connaitre ses origines. Profondément troublée, la mort décidera d’offrir au capitaine un pacte : elle lui redonneras la vie, ainsi qu’un bateau bien garni, en échange de sa promesse de lui livrer ses aventures en écrits ainsi que la mission de retracer ses origines. Elle le mettra toutefois en garde, ses histoires devront être bonnes car « à châtiment repoussé n’attends que châtiment plus grand»! </p>

NEW MERCH AVAILABLE
For the last days of the campaign we have added fresh new and original merchandise!

 
The Golden Beard Project : 
We're a multicultural team of creators (illustrators, writers, and musicians) who have been working on the Golden Beard project for years. Over thirty individuals have contributed their talents to Golden Beard!
Our next adventure is the creation of three 24-page comic books. We are asking for your help in covering the costs of illustration and printing the books in time for Halloween this year. The book is a home-grown labour of love, created in Montreal with collaboration between creators from around the world.
Golden Beard is a story we have been working on for years and that we feel has to be told with drawings and music. It is a kick ass pirate story that has something profound, rich and worthy of your attention. We also want to build soundtracks for every comic book that gets out there, to enhance the reading experience.
Our first instrumental album is available for FREE. HERE
Check out some completed art HERE
From the bottom of our scurvy hearts, we thank you for your support! Will Golden Beard be able to escape his fate and trick Death into letting him live again? He just might... but he will need your help!""

The Story
Waiting for death to watch the movie of his life, Golden Beard, a famous pirate, bypasses the queue leading to the final judgment. He requests to be immediately redirected to earth; his sailors are caught in a brawl and he must save them, as well as his honor. Death, who is a joyful little girl spending the most of her time playing and trying to escape the exercise of her functions, notices the pirate and takes him into her spooky gardens to drink tea with other famous historical characters such as Hitler, Ghandi and Napoleon. She will play with him like a toy, which will bring the pirate to criticize her existence. This highlights the truths of the meaningless life she leads and destabilizes her profoundly. Death then accepts to make the captain discover the intricacies of her mysterious and dark world, while continuing to play with him like a toy.
She will then offer the captain a deal: restoring his life and giving him a well-stocked ship in exchange of stories of his adventures written in a book as well as the promise to retrace her origins. Death then warns him; stories must be exquisite because what pushes punishment only waits for deeper punishment!

Main Themes
Golden Beard is a suspense, action and gore comic-book filled with dark humor that explores different themes as : animality vs humanity, anarchism vs capitalism, time and money slipping, revolution, fair sharing, environnement,
Its the story of Death not knowing where she comes from, even though she watches everybody's movie of life with them after death. It is the story of Death and life being twin sisters that hate each other.
It is the story of gods being bankers of time in a recession. A story that brings us all to question ourselves on our origins through death trying to humanize itself. Ironicaly, it is the story of a pirate Captain being prisoner in his will for complete freedom.

Over-Shoot Objectives
If we get pas our goal of 6666$, we want to show you our commitment by focusing on further objectives to push the project further. We will also reward our contributors with free extra stuff.

So use it. Pirate it. Remix It. Colour it. Photoshop it. If you want High Quality Artwork or Music tracks, write us at contribute@goldenbeardproject.com. Actually, our work is under a creative commons liscence.
Our overshoot objectives are to create more comic book episodes, more artwork, a full length soundtrack and to create a platform of collaboration.

Notre prochain projet est de faire 3 BD de 24p colorées et nous visons les sortir avant Halloween 2013! Nous souhaitons aussi faire des trames sonores uniques pour chaque BD qui va sortir afin d’enrichir l’expérience de lecture.
C’est pour ça qu’on a besoin de vous! La campagne IndieGogo nous sert à amasser des fonds afin de couvrir les coûts d’illustration, de couleur et d’impression. Ces fonds vont aussi nous permettre de signer un contrat de distribution avec un distributeur majeur. Le projet sera basé à Montréal avec des collaborateurs venant des 4 coins du globe.
Golden Beard (Barbe Or) est une histoire sur laquelle nous travaillons depuis plusieurs années qui mérite d’être racontée avec des dessins et de la musique. C’est une histoire « à vous botter le cul » qui a quelque chose de profond, de riche et qui mérite votre précieuse attention.

L’Histoire
En attendant que la mort regarde le film de sa vie, Barbe Or, un pirate de renom, court-circuite la file menant au jugement dernier. Il demande d’être réexpédié sur terre car ses marins sont pris dans une escarmouche et il doit les sauver ainsi que son honneur. La mort, une jolie petite fille passant la majorité de son temps à échapper à l’exercice de ses fonctions, prends d’affection le pirate et l’invite à entrer dans son univers fantasmagorique. Elle jouera avec l’ours en peluche dans son salon de thé avec des personnages historiques connus : Hitler, Gandhi, Napoléon etc. Au fil du temps, le Pirate réussiras à toucher les cordes sensibles de la mort; mettant le doigt sur l’incapacité de celle-ci à connaitre ses origines. Profondément troublée, la mort décidera d’offrir au capitaine un pacte : elle lui redonneras la vie, ainsi qu’un bateau bien garni, en échange de sa promesse de lui livrer ses aventures en écrits ainsi que la mission de retracer ses origines. Elle le mettra toutefois en garde, ses histoires devront être bonnes car « à châtiment repoussé n’attends que châtiment plus grand»!

It started out as a single graphic novel written in Urdu, aiming to create a superhero that the Pakistani audience could relate to. But with the help of this campaign, we are turning Shamsheer into just the first of several titles in English, Urdu and several regional languages. Launching under the banner of 'Udham Publications', Shamsheer will be the masthead of the company and the first of several characters that we hope will become representative of the South Asian and particularly Pakistani culture.Currently, this region of the world is almost entirely lacking in heroes, and a comic book culture is next to non-existent. Udham Publications is trying overcome these gaps with rich, resonating stories that can serve as a platform to bring together people of the region. To see why we think this is important, please watch the video above.Who We AreUdham Publications is currently a team of 3 comic book and anime lovers. 

The original concept of Shamsheer was developed by Salman Nasir, who is also the lead artist on the project and an illustrator and storyboard artist by profession

The bulk of story and concept is done by Zakaullah Khan, who has spent 9 years writing stories for brands in various advertising agencies
Danish Ejaz, with his 9 years as Account Management marshals our efforts and looks after all the business concerns that the rest of us creative types don't understand
What We Need & What You GetEven if our comic book is as successful as we hope it will be, it'll be about a year before it is able to pay for itself. Till then, we need about $50,000 to pay for some more hands on the project (including an artist, a colorist and an additional writer), their systems and stationery, and a place to work in, all for one year without us going broke in the process. In return we can give you some rewards, depending on how much support you give us. Here's a little visual chart of what each level will get you:(All the 'issues' mentioned in the rewards here and in the next section refer to the digital, English language version of the comic.)Beyond The GoalIf you really show your love for Shamsheer and we go beyond our basic goal, we would be happy to do more for all of you that make it possible. Other Ways You Can HelpWe don't need just money! If you can't contribute, or if you already contributed and still want to do more, please spread the word! You can do it any way you like, and to help you, there are several easy ways given above (just under the video). What if we Don't reach the Goal?!We are now dedicated to launching Shamsheer, no matter what. So even if we don't reach our basic goal, we will still use whatever earnings we get to start the process, get one or two issues out. In this situation, we may have to go to investors and sell a share of the character... losing some amount of control over it in the process... but that's better than letting it die completely.

<p>Have you stopped? If so, good for
you, you just made the best decision of your life. If not, you’re making a
mistake. This whole page is one giant post-modern circle jerk. It’s a waste of
perfectly GOOD TIME, TIME you could spend outside, being productive, helping
people in NEED. Instead, you’re hunched in front of a screen, RUINING YOUR
POSTURE, reading words that have no real reason for being written. The contents
of this page include various reasons why you SHOULD NOT DONATE to it. Yes,
THAT’S REALLY IT. It’s as stupid as that. Why would you ever want to donate to
this page? Exactly! Glad we agree. Do not donate to this page. Do not share
this page. Do you really want to infect society with this kind of drivel? How
will your friends PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR SCREENS if you BOTHER them with the
BULLSHIT of Do Not Donate. Don’t they have enough on THEIR PLATES? BIRDS that
are ANGRY, CANDY that needs to be CRUSHED, and those TEMPLES won’t RUN
THEMSELVES! FARMS need FARMING, SIMS need SIMMING and nobody wants to read the
BRUTAL HONESTY of some NOBODY. What’s worse is, the person who created this
page is a lonely, confused Caucasian male domesticated primate that lives on
the planet Earth in a country some other primates named Canada. He is a spoiled
little asshole who is too cynical and bitter for the world he lives in. This
often gets him in trouble. He rarely gets outside and eats poorly. He does not
have his shit together and you should not take his advice. Except to NOT donate
to this page. He’s right about that. He is 26 years old and lives on his own

<p>Should you still be reading, you
are not WELCOME, but nonetheless, this is DO NOT DONATE. The rules are simple.</p>
<p>1. Do not

you know someone to donate, REPORT THEM IMMEDIATELY FOR EXECUTION.</p>

<p><b><u>Aren’t you
more concerned with other <a href=""http://store.tcgplayer.com/magic/product/show?productname=worthy%20cause&amp;partner=AUTOANY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Worthy Cause</a>s?</u></b></p>
<p>Every year we hear about some trendy new
virus or disease that will wipe out life as we know it. Have you donated to the
Cause of the Year? If the answer is no, you should not donate to this page.
There are many <a href=""http://store.tcgplayer.com/magic/product/show?productname=worthy%20cause&amp;partner=AUTOANY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Worthy Cause</a>s that need funding out there, and plenty of
organizations where your money DEFINITELY isn’t used MOSTLY for clerical upkeep
and salary. You should donate to one of these organizations, so that their
organizers can continue to organize. Parties! Galas! This is how we eradicate
disease, people. Big Pharma and The Governments have been researching for YEARS
trying to find cures for what ails the human race. Look at all the Cures that
have been discovered in the past 20 years! Look at how far modern medicine has
come! This would not be possible without your generous donations. Don’t you want
to feel SPECIAL when you spend your money? CHARITABLE even? You’re definitely
donating to these organizations because you care about THE CAUSE right? Not
because you feel guilty about something else and are displacing your feelings?
Of course not! I don’t want any of your feelings. Keep your money. Do not
donate to this page. </p>
<p>Speaking of The Governments, they need
your money more than ever and the ridiculous taxes just won’t cut it anymore!
The Governments need P.R. campaigns and they need them NOW! Bush, Harper, these
are our modern day CRUSADERS, waging wars tht they have absolutely no
profitable interest in. WARS ARE EXPENSIVE, PEOPLE! Look at all the pensions
and services Governments are constantly blowing to bits! Do you think these
activities and committees are free? Heck no, dummy! The Governments need to
finance these firings and WHERE DO YOU THINK THE MONEY COMES FROM? Freedom
isn’t free people, and you’ve got two arms and two legs anyway. You can afford
to spend one of each. Stop being so selfish! This isn’t about you, this is
about the arbitrary location on the planet Earth where you were expelled from a
vagina. And that’s not all The Governments need money for! Why do you think
they’re always hiding so much from the public? Because transparency costs
money! Donate to your local chapter of The Governments RIGHT NOW so that they
can finally reveal all the shady dealings and conspiracies none of us will ever
hear about! Need to know? More like SPEND to know! Aren’t you curious about
Roswell and 9/11? Send them your money and I’m SURE they’ll use it in ways that
only benefit YOU DIRECTLY. Remember, each Government is special and different,
and the Best Government Ever. They’re the only ones who know What’s Best For
Us…until the next group comes along. Save your money for the next puppet show;
this will improve your quality of life by leaps and bounds! You want your life
to be properly run for you, don’t you? Show them in the only way they

<p><b><u>I
will probably spend all donations irresponsibly.</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>I do not have a TV, so I
don’t see most of the ads you do. For this reason, I will likely spend ANY
MONEY DONATED irresponsibly on STUPID necessities like rent, food, and books. I
might do something REALLY CRAZY like finance the pretentious unpublished book
of short stories and poetry I have written that NOBODY WILL EVER READ
OTHERWISE. Did you just read what I wrote? I’m telling you I will use this
money to pursue studies and art. I will be reading books while PERFECTLY GOOD
NIGHTCLUBS will see none of this money. Aren’t you worried about your favourite
HOT SPOT shutting down? Where else will you get to see all the SEXY SINGLES
now, other than the Internet? Give THEM the money, or you might NEVER DANCE
AGAIN! I am NOT COOL like YOU. You’re probably way, way COOLER than I am,
anyway. Do you want to risk your HARD-FOUGHT SOCIAL STATUS by associating your
wallet with a NERD like me? Nobody with a life would choose to waste their
Monday writing garbage like this. Isn’t your entire identity based on what
others think of you (or what you think others think of you)? Better to just
give your paycheck to people that are Known As COOL. They’ll genuinely LOVE
YOU. Like so many absent fathers, you could start showing your affection (or
guilt) monetarily. Buy that pretty miss some flowers! Buy that handsome fella
some flowers! Flowers are a really useful way of temporarily telling someone
you love them. Give flowers to random strangers on the street. Put them in the barrels
of guns. Remember, society says you are NOT ALLOWED to feel good about yourself
unless it comes from an external source, and even then, only until the feeling
wilts away. Redouble your desperate attempts to be One of THE FLOCK, and this
time come armed with a $$MONEY GUN$$. Don’t donate it here, because I will not
spend it on flowers that are found in nature ANYWAY. I am not cool. I will not
add to society in any practical way. I will spend the money foolishly donated
here frivolously. I might buy a crown and a goblet. I might develop a drug
problem and you’ll be FORCED to LAUGH at me as my darkest moments are BROADCAST
RIGHT INTO YOUR LIVING ROOM. Isn’t it fun when RICH PEOPLE get HURT and
EMBARRASSED and YOU GET TO WATCH? Do you really want to HURT me? Do you really
want to MAKE ME CRY? I am not a USELESS CELEBRITY, not yet anyway. I am just some
little turd who likes satire. Celebrities champion <a href=""http://store.tcgplayer.com/magic/product/show?productname=worthy%20cause&amp;partner=AUTOANY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Worthy Cause</a>S all the time,
which every single one of them CLEARLY CARES ABOUT SO MUCH. Sure, some celebrities
have used their status to do real good in the world BUT THEY’RE NOT THE ONES
YOU READ ABOUT IN THE PAPERS. Why do you think you see the smiling faces of
beautiful, ideal, REAL, men and women while waiting in line at the SUPERMARKET?
Next to the CHOCOLATES and CANDY and CONDOMS? Beautiful faces and slim,
muscular bodies that are ENTIRELY REALISTIC. Don’t believe that ZEN BALONEY
about there being no ideal man or woman, YOU KNOW THERE ARE and they smile at
you EVERYWHERE so you can feel GOOD about yourself! SMILE BACK AT THEIR
PERFECTLY ALTERED FACES. Pull down your blindfold, put in your headphones and
follow them OFF A CLIFF. If all your friends jump off a bridge DO YOU WANT TO
BE LAST ONE IN THE WATER? Furthermore, don’t bother with the introductory section
of the page. We might never know who the author REALLY IS. How do YOU know he
isn’t a DEMON, ALIEN, or WORSE, an AVERAGE WHITE GUY WITH RED HAIR. DO NOT
TRUST HIM HE IS INSANE. There certainly can’t be MORE to life than The Church
of the Dollar. Make an offering to the Church today! Take your hard earned
money and SET IT ON FIRE. As the smoke rises to the sky and YOUR ONE TRUE GOD
smiles down on you, hoard your money into a bonfire! You’ll need every dollar
to TRULY FEEL SPECIAL so make sure you do NOT donate even a single PENNY to
this page!</p>
<p><b><u>Don’t you
have expenses?</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>Speaking of reasons you should NOT
donate to this page, don’t you have EXPENSES to take care of? GAS ain’t going
to be around forever, and it ain’t free! Look at how the prices spike up and
down like the heart monitor of a TERMINAL PATIENT. Anybody with their eyes and
ears open knows that it’s clearly due to a lack of funding. These people are
literally TRANSFORMING THE PLANET and they make measly BILLIONS. We all know
gas and car companies need MORE OF A MARKET SHARE. We all agreed to block the
electric car and alternative energies THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE WORLD WAR 2
so they could KEEP PROFITING OFF US and that was COOL, but it WASN’T ENOUGH.
These people are the REASON you can get to work so expensively! Without THEM
you’d be NOTHING, and they tell you so every day by playing darts with your
life savings. Alcohol and cigarette prices have also increased EXPONENTIALLY IN
PRICE while retaining or losing ALL VALUE. Only one explanation makes sense and
that these companies simply do not have the RESOURCES they need to SATISFY YOU,
THE CUSTOMER. They raise prices to HELP YOU! Sure you might not be able to
afford as much, but the SCARCITY they CREATE will make the infrequent
CONSUMPTIONS feel SPECIAL. You’ll value them SO MUCH MORE. CHERISH THEM, even.
They’re only BREAKING THE BANK to BUILD YOU BACK UP. You have a fiver in your
pocket? YOU KNOW WHERE IT SHOULD GO. Get that new cell phone! Your current one
will be useless within a few months ANYWAY, when the new operating software
they release causes it to be OBSOLETE. Remember when appliances were BUILT TO
LAST and not to LAST UNTIL THEY BREAK? Neither do I! That’s why you should give
your FAVOURITE COMPANY a direct entry into your BANK ACCOUNT. You’re going to
spend the money anyways, aren’t you? It doesn’t matter, close this page right
now, DO NOT SLOW DOWN LONG ENOUGH TO DONATE, grab your Venti Latte and get out
INTO THE REAL WORLD. Remember your SUBCONSCIOUS BRAINWASHING, that YOUR LIFE is
MEANINGLESS UNLESS YOU ACHIEVE!</p>
<p><b><u>You are
not ALLOWED to donate to this page</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>In addition to financial and logistical
problems you’ll face if you donate to this page, this page is my personal
property and I am NOT giving you PERMISSION to donate to it. If you know of any
one donating to this page, please let me know RIGHT AWAY so I can write them a
VERY ANGRY sounding thank you letter, or email, should they provide their
various addresses. Furthermore, FREEDOM is an illusion. If you were really FREE
you would be able to donate to this page, BUT YOU’RE NOT. YOU DON’T HAVE
PERMISSION. On what grounds? Because I SAID so, SHITLORD. Think about that for
a second, but not too long. That might hurt. Either way, if the best way to get
a human to DO SOMETHING is to tell them NOT TO DO THAT THING, then THIS PAGE IS
A LIE!!! including the previous sentence, the words before the comma five words
ago, and how this sentence ends. Confused? Don’t be! Close this page right away
and REPORT IT TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES. Tell them this page is a dirty,
no-good, commie, scum sucking LIE, or at least, it might be. Tell them I
reserve the right to change and evolve my personal philosophy as my life
progresses. I might not even be the SAME PERSON tomorrow, but that won’t hold
up in THEIR COURTS. So remember: DON’T LET MY LIES INFECT YOU, you’re probably
a well-adjusted, competent tax-payer and you don’t want to FALL IN with the
WRONG CROWD. Save yourself and the authorities all the trouble and simply do
NOT donate to this page.</p>

<p><b><u>CONCLUSION.</u></b></p>
<p>In
conclusion, I hope you learned nothing from reading these useless words. My
goal in writing this page was just to waste your time and mine and it looks
like I SUCCEEDED, so suck it. There are MANY reasons you SHOULD NOT DONATE to
this page. Should YOU DARE TO DONATE, I might have to CONTINUE wasting
EVERYBODY’s time with more ESSAYS ON NOTHING. STICK UP FOR A BETTER SOCIETY.
Put your money SOMEWHERE THAT MATTERS, like UNDER THE MATTRESS or your BOSS’
POCKET. I don’t want your money. I don’t need your money. I am VERY HAPPY being
POOR. Isn’t that STRANGE?! LEAVE ME ALONE NOW, you’re making me ANXIOUS by
STARING. </p>

BE LAST ONE IN THE WATER? Furthermore, don’t bother with the introductory section
of the page. We might never know who the author REALLY IS. How do YOU know he
isn’t a DEMON, ALIEN, or WORSE, an AVERAGE WHITE GUY WITH RED HAIR. DO NOT
TRUST HIM HE IS INSANE. There certainly can’t be MORE to life than The Church
of the Dollar. Make an offering to the Church today! Take your hard earned
money and SET IT ON FIRE. As the smoke rises to the sky and YOUR ONE TRUE GOD
smiles down on you, hoard your money into a bonfire! You’ll need every dollar
to TRULY FEEL SPECIAL so make sure you do NOT donate even a single PENNY to
this page!
Don’t you
have expenses?

Speaking of reasons you should NOT
donate to this page, don’t you have EXPENSES to take care of? GAS ain’t going
to be around forever, and it ain’t free! Look at how the prices spike up and
down like the heart monitor of a TERMINAL PATIENT. Anybody with their eyes and
ears open knows that it’s clearly due to a lack of funding. These people are
literally TRANSFORMING THE PLANET and they make measly BILLIONS. We all know
gas and car companies need MORE OF A MARKET SHARE. We all agreed to block the
electric car and alternative energies THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE WORLD WAR 2
so they could KEEP PROFITING OFF US and that was COOL, but it WASN’T ENOUGH.
These people are the REASON you can get to work so expensively! Without THEM
you’d be NOTHING, and they tell you so every day by playing darts with your
life savings. Alcohol and cigarette prices have also increased EXPONENTIALLY IN
PRICE while retaining or losing ALL VALUE. Only one explanation makes sense and
that these companies simply do not have the RESOURCES they need to SATISFY YOU,
THE CUSTOMER. They raise prices to HELP YOU! Sure you might not be able to
afford as much, but the SCARCITY they CREATE will make the infrequent
CONSUMPTIONS feel SPECIAL. You’ll value them SO MUCH MORE. CHERISH THEM, even.
They’re only BREAKING THE BANK to BUILD YOU BACK UP. You have a fiver in your
pocket? YOU KNOW WHERE IT SHOULD GO. Get that new cell phone! Your current one
will be useless within a few months ANYWAY, when the new operating software
they release causes it to be OBSOLETE. Remember when appliances were BUILT TO
LAST and not to LAST UNTIL THEY BREAK? Neither do I! That’s why you should give
your FAVOURITE COMPANY a direct entry into your BANK ACCOUNT. You’re going to
spend the money anyways, aren’t you? It doesn’t matter, close this page right
now, DO NOT SLOW DOWN LONG ENOUGH TO DONATE, grab your Venti Latte and get out
INTO THE REAL WORLD. Remember your SUBCONSCIOUS BRAINWASHING, that YOUR LIFE is
MEANINGLESS UNLESS YOU ACHIEVE!
You are
not ALLOWED to donate to this page

In addition to financial and logistical
problems you’ll face if you donate to this page, this page is my personal
property and I am NOT giving you PERMISSION to donate to it. If you know of any
one donating to this page, please let me know RIGHT AWAY so I can write them a
VERY ANGRY sounding thank you letter, or email, should they provide their
various addresses. Furthermore, FREEDOM is an illusion. If you were really FREE
you would be able to donate to this page, BUT YOU’RE NOT. YOU DON’T HAVE
PERMISSION. On what grounds? Because I SAID so, SHITLORD. Think about that for
a second, but not too long. That might hurt. Either way, if the best way to get
a human to DO SOMETHING is to tell them NOT TO DO THAT THING, then THIS PAGE IS
A LIE!!! including the previous sentence, the words before the comma five words
ago, and how this sentence ends. Confused? Don’t be! Close this page right away
and REPORT IT TO THE PROPER AUTHORITIES. Tell them this page is a dirty,
no-good, commie, scum sucking LIE, or at least, it might be. Tell them I
reserve the right to change and evolve my personal philosophy as my life
progresses. I might not even be the SAME PERSON tomorrow, but that won’t hold
up in THEIR COURTS. So remember: DON’T LET MY LIES INFECT YOU, you’re probably
a well-adjusted, competent tax-payer and you don’t want to FALL IN with the
WRONG CROWD. Save yourself and the authorities all the trouble and simply do
NOT donate to this page.

CONCLUSION.
In
conclusion, I hope you learned nothing from reading these useless words. My
goal in writing this page was just to waste your time and mine and it looks
like I SUCCEEDED, so suck it. There are MANY reasons you SHOULD NOT DONATE to
this page. Should YOU DARE TO DONATE, I might have to CONTINUE wasting
EVERYBODY’s time with more ESSAYS ON NOTHING. STICK UP FOR A BETTER SOCIETY.
Put your money SOMEWHERE THAT MATTERS, like UNDER THE MATTRESS or your BOSS’
POCKET. I don’t want your money. I don’t need your money. I am VERY HAPPY being
POOR. Isn’t that STRANGE?! LEAVE ME ALONE NOW, you’re making me ANXIOUS by
STARING. 
For any
questions, too bad. Do not email seriouslydonotdonate@gmail.com. Do not follow
@plsdontdonate on Twitter. These accounts are useless and will NEVER EVER EVER
be responded to. I REFUSE to PERSONALLY ANSWER any QUESTIONS, INQUIRES, PROPOSITIONS,
CONTRACTS, PROPHECIES, DISCIPLINARY SUMMONS, SWEEPSTAKES, F4F REQUESTS, TBTS,
ANYTHING WITH THE WORD EPIC, ANYTHING CONTAINING A HASTAG (ESP. #BLESSED),
PRAISE, BLAME, SHAME, FAME, or even to my NAME.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been drawing comics for a year or so and have made a couple zines of comics.  I started an hourly comic project to force myself to work on my discipline, or in simple terms, to make myself do a lot of drawing.  And, i am!  I'm spending about three or four hours a day drawing comics right now, and it's great. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need funding for this project for a few reasons:</p>
<p>* printing a zine or mini-book sized collection of all of these comics at the end of january is going to cost some money, particularly if i print books. </p>
<p>* i'm self-employed and taking time away from my work to do this project. </p>
<p>* i'm actually going through a lot of drawing pens! </p>
<p>Whether i reach my funding goal or not, any money i make here is going into printing  costs, drawing supplies, or giving me the funds to be able to spend time drawing comics. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you get for helping to fund this project? </p>
<p>Some, any or all of the following:  </p>
<p>* The finished zine! (or book?)  (60-90 pages, ish, of not fit for society hourly comics) </p>
<p>* stickers from the zine</p>
<p>* patches from the zine</p>
<p>* magnets from the zine</p>
<p>* prints of fancy versions of some of my favourite comics from the zine</p>
<p>* other zines i've written</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Part of the appeal of this project to me is that i've read other people's monthly comics projects and i know for a fact that they're fascinating and really addicting to read.  </p>
<p>This has also already been a really healthy experience for me.  Documenting what i do with every hour of every day makes me work harder to do things that are worthwhile.  It's also creating an interesting heightened awareness of what's going on </p>
<p>Hopefully, writing/drawing about whatever life experiences i'm going through will be helpful to anyone else struggling with related experiences.  It helps to know that we all fuck up, get confused, get overwhelmed, etc, as well as get excited, play, and live life the best we can.</p>
<p>In terms of my ability to complete this project, i feel really good about it.  I already have ten half-size pages of comics drawn.  I expect the finished, month-long zine or book to be somewhere between 60 and 90 half-sized pages.   I've made a couple of zines before, and this feels like a reasonable goal.  </p>

<h2>Vigilance: The vigilant defender<img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/598958_10151526587450152_1406471975_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 366px; height: 520px;""/>
</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Created by Devon Camel who both writes and illusttrates the series.</p>
<p>Vigilance is a story over seven years in the making. It's a story about a young man that learns that he's a greater purpose in his life than other guy's his age. He learns that he is an alter-sapien, a person born with enhanced abilities like increased speed, strength and agility.</p>
<p>aside from learning his new abilities, he discovers that he comes from a legacy of a masked crimefighter named Vigilance which was a mantle that was once taken by his father and his grandfather before him and now after experiencing tragedies in his own life, young Ezekiel washington dons the mask of his forefathers to take on a mysterious terrorist that has plagued the streets of Baren Acres known only by the identity of T.H.U.G(Terrorism, hatred, under greed). Unknown to Ezekiel, the evil terrorist and him have more in common than he thinks.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise $2500 to cover the cost of printing the graphic novel and paying for tables at comic conventions and creating promotional items such as t-shirts, stickers etc. to create the fan base for the character and the graphic novel.</p>
<p>I know that this can't happen without support and that's where you, the people come in. By making generous donations towards this project shows that there is room for a different type of hero (nothing against Marvel or DC) and that independent stories can be told and enjoyed as well.</p>
<p>here are a few things to offered for those that support the dream:</p>
<p>The anti-bullying issue where Ezekiel deals with a young man being bullied in his school.</p>
<p>the chacter biography book which contains character art and production material for the series(sort of like the bonus features on a dvd lol)</p>
<p>and more</p>

</div></div>","Vigilance: The vigilant defender

 
Created by Devon Camel who both writes and illusttrates the series.
Vigilance is a story over seven years in the making. It's a story about a young man that learns that he's a greater purpose in his life than other guy's his age. He learns that he is an alter-sapien, a person born with enhanced abilities like increased speed, strength and agility.
aside from learning his new abilities, he discovers that he comes from a legacy of a masked crimefighter named Vigilance which was a mantle that was once taken by his father and his grandfather before him and now after experiencing tragedies in his own life, young Ezekiel washington dons the mask of his forefathers to take on a mysterious terrorist that has plagued the streets of Baren Acres known only by the identity of T.H.U.G(Terrorism, hatred, under greed). Unknown to Ezekiel, the evil terrorist and him have more in common than he thinks.
 


What We Need & What You Get
My goal is to raise $2500 to cover the cost of printing the graphic novel and paying for tables at comic conventions and creating promotional items such as t-shirts, stickers etc. to create the fan base for the character and the graphic novel.
I know that this can't happen without support and that's where you, the people come in. By making generous donations towards this project shows that there is room for a different type of hero (nothing against Marvel or DC) and that independent stories can be told and enjoyed as well.
here are a few things to offered for those that support the dream:
The anti-bullying issue where Ezekiel deals with a young man being bullied in his school.
the chacter biography book which contains character art and production material for the series(sort of like the bonus features on a dvd lol)
and more

<p>Ribbit and Snibbit is a tale that began as an oral

has become a gorgeous book with detailed illustrations that will charge
children’s imaginations with fascinating scientific facts and theories and is
quite child friendly and lighthearted (apart from a small nuclear threat, a few
nefariously cunning and rabid weasels and some corrupted political leaders here
and there – I assure you I’m not talking about congress, this is a children’s

<p>To me the most important thing is how the story develops
over the chapters.  These books celebrate
uniqueness, individuality, self reliance and thinking for one’s self.  While I’m not going to give away plot points I
do think it is important to mention that the special needs community as well as
their treatment by others is responsibly addressed and effective at portraying
their differences as strengths that must be utilized in order for the

<p>I asked some close friends that are involved in helping me
with this project what they thought my generous and heroic readers would appreciate
for a hypothetical Ribbit and Snibbit book.  The overwhelming majority wished to see two
variations of it beginning with the whole story as an individual library of
large 9x12 colorful books and later a high quality series of gallery quality
collectible books, each containing 3-4 books that would total about 120 pages. </p>

they won't stay in abundance and they won’t be signed or come with the other

<p><b>Q: Why did these frogs

<p>So if the goal is met this is basically a grand preorder
event for the first of a series of books but it is so much more.  The whole reason “The Adventures of Ribbit
and Snibbit” made it beyond the oral version told to my daughter at bedtime was
to fund and start a foundation that will help special children from 0-5 with
physical and mental challenges like my son Joe through the design of an
incredible positive patient outcome website.

smaller amount of books, the difference being that the production costs will be
more expensive and the amount going to fund the foundation will not be as

she is the mother of invention!</b></p>
<p>Simply put, my wife (Joe’s mom) started all this by telling
me about her desire for us to advocate for other local parents of other special
needs children.  I saw a need; I looked
for an existing solution and found none. 
So I started the process of figuring out how to fill in the gaps for
other families who were in a similar situation to us and make it free for
parents while being self funded into the future.  That last part relies on the success of this
crowd funding event for this book.  If crowd
funding fails then everything will be much harder to achieve – I will not give
up, but it will be much harder.  </p>
<p><b>STRETCH GOALS</b></p><p>It should also be noted that while I’m increasing the
quality of the product with some of the stretch goals listed below, the site’s
total funding cost of $100,000 can get started with sufficient momentum with
the original goal of $25,000 being met. 
That is a bargain especially when you consider that the new government
healthcare site cost over $600 Million to develop and didn't even work at launch
– You might call that a crowd funding project since it was paid for with tax
dollars.  Meanwhile, my programmers have
guaranteed their work to “function properly” and not exceed the budgeted amount
including beta testing.  This site will also be completely free for parents to use. 
<a href=""http://ribbitandsnibbit.com/?p=193"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">You can learn all about it on the website.</a></p>
<p>Since the initial goal of $25,000 will cover expenses and
shipping costs for the first book as well as being able to get started on the positive patient outcome site here are some goals that I've set for the
fantastic reality of achieving and surpassing the initial goal.  My hope is that by having a crowd funding
event for the first book followed by books 2 and 3 and finally offering the
special edition graphic novel we can continue to publish the book without
needing a publisher and also to put in even more money into the foundation.  Remember, the entire cost of the site is
$100,000 so if we could reach anywhere near that, it would be an unbelievable

<h3>About Me<br/>
</h3>My name is Ken Turner and I'm an animator/illustrator currently residing in Toronto who has worked 
in the animation, illustration and film industry. <br/><br/>I graduated from the BAA Animation program in 2007 at Sheridan College.
  During which I collaborated on a short film called “Umbrella Boy”, 
which won 2nd place at the Ottawa Animation Film Festival in 2006.  
Later that year I directed my first 2D animated group short film, 
“<a href=""http://vimeo.com/14971625"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Attack of the Giant Vegetable Monsters</a>”.  It would go on to win the 
2008 Jackson Hole/MovieHatch.com Cowboy Award for Best Animation.  In 
2007 I directed my final film and first stop motion animated short 
film, “<a href=""http://vimeo.com/14811088"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">TiM</a>”, which was a homage to my favorite film director Tim 
Burton. In 2011 it played at the New York LES (lower east side) Film Festival as an official opening night and animation night selection.  I've worked as a character designer and animator for various
 studios such as C.O.R.E Toons (Iggy Arbuckle), Cookie Jar 
Entertainment, 9 Story Entertainment/Nelvana (My Friend Rabbit, Spliced)
 and Cuppa Coffee Studios (Ugly Americans).<br/><br/>From 2008 to 2010, I have self published four books.  My first illustrated book was called “<a href=""http://kenturner.blogspot.com/2009/08/night-at-movies-books-are-now-in.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">A Night at the Movies</a>”, which was a surreal take on the communal experience of going to a 
theatre to see films.  My next two books were illustrated humor books called “<a href=""http://kenturner.blogspot.com/2010/02/eye-candy-volume-1-village-idioms-books.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Eye Candy Volume #1:

<p>The core team here founded Golden Bell with a basic principle, ""Comics for Change"". We set our sights on the world to bring diversity to a medium that has less then often ever seen any real change. While Rachel Korsen is an Artist &amp; Animator, Marc Goldner &amp; Rob Gross are writers. We've always decided to put creative above all else because without a good idea to develop, there will be nothing for anyone to execute. While Marc operates daily business activity including expanding the Golden Bell family, Rachel &amp; Rob are creating brand new and original content every day. As publishers, we've launched our imprint with The Sunday Comics and have already printed our ""ZERO"" issue that we know you're all going to adore &amp; love!</p>
<p><b><i>300 creators are part of The Sunday Comics? Who are they?!</i></b></p>
<p>Our creators are what have made this whole adventure possible. Without them we don't know where we would be. While we may not have enough room to spotlight everyone, we wanted to give you just a taste of the sheer level of talent that are creating brand new original content for The Sunday Comics. If you'd like to see a full list of the creators and check out their other works please visit our website at <a href=""http://www.thesundaycomics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.TheSundayComics.com</a> </p>

While Rachel Korsen is an Artist & Animator, Marc Goldner & Rob Gross are writers. We've always decided to put creative above all else because without a good idea to develop, there will be nothing for anyone to execute.

I've been creating manga/comics for about 6-7 years now and I now I need your help! My biggest issue over the years has been lack of funds towards getting books printed and advertising however I feel now is the time to really get things moving forward with my latest comic/manga project Double Blackness.</p>

Everyone comes from far and wide to play at this arcade to prove they are the best. 2 different sets of teens rule the arcade Double Blackness made up of Nick Fever and Joe Powerfist and the Lightspeed Rockers made up from Jarrel Lee and Andrew Fullz and they are always challenging each other for top spot at the arcade.

<p><strong>About</strong></p>
<p>""My name is Santana, friends call me Santana. This is our Indiegogo campaign to print the first issue of our adventure. Adventure? Better call it a tragedy, since everyone here has lost something precious... Who cares! If you really want to know about it, you should support us in this campaign, I'm tired of doing the talking. Move on.""</p>
<p><strong>The story</strong></p>
<p>Wallace House is a fantasy comic book that roots in the superhero and nerd culture of our times.</p>
<p>In a sick society ruled by criminals and delinquency, Pacific City youth has just two choices: being victims of the system or joining it. No option grants them a rosy future, so, many guys are looking for a shelter in a world of fantasy, where they can live like heroes and heroines, and where it’s still possible to believe in hope and justice.</p>
<p>Teenagers indulge in their imagination until they can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality. A facility  will help the most needy teenagers: Wallace House. Or at least that's how it looks like.</p>
<p>What happens in Wallace House? Why some of its guests are starting to show unique abilities that transcend human limits?</p>
<p>Meanwhile the city is under Smile gang control, led by the eccentric Lullaby. Arika is an orphan with a dire background. She’s tired of the cynicism and the apathy that pervades the city. So, she decides to step in and declares war on crime in Pacific City. Arika will be the enemy of the Smile gang: a conflict with unpredictable and unexpected results.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527330149/btdvcdgfaav9uq2as44e.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Chiara Colasanti 's drawing of Arika for GreenMoonArtist</i></p>
<p>Wallace House shows how heroes are not just made by superpowers or huge wealth: this story tells about the potential that each of us has got within themselves. The comic book tells about out-of-the-ordinary teenagers. Their passions and dreams are a source of courage, perseverance, and desire to prove themselves. And there is even an animal you will be surprised of: wait for a fantasy twist!</p>
<p>Wallace House is a story in three volumes of over 85 pages per volume. This comic book is suitable for all ages, a mix of many elements that comes from the nerd culture.</p>
<p>There’re many different traits and artists that alternate themselves in a perfect mix of humor and action, combined with a healthy dose of realism and introspection.</p>

<p>The mysterious leader of the Smile band. In a few years he succeeded in imposing himself as the kingpin of Pacific City. Haunted by a troubled past, he floods the streets of the city with his anger and his drug, bringing hundreds of youngsters to destruction and killing anyone on his way.

<p>A melancholic middle-aged man who seems to have lost interest in life and other people.

About
""My name is Santana, friends call me Santana. This is our Indiegogo campaign to print the first issue of our adventure. Adventure? Better call it a tragedy, since everyone here has lost something precious... Who cares! If you really want to know about it, you should support us in this campaign, I'm tired of doing the talking. Move on.""
The story
Wallace House is a fantasy comic book that roots in the superhero and nerd culture of our times.
In a sick society ruled by criminals and delinquency, Pacific City youth has just two choices: being victims of the system or joining it. No option grants them a rosy future, so, many guys are looking for a shelter in a world of fantasy, where they can live like heroes and heroines, and where it’s still possible to believe in hope and justice.
Teenagers indulge in their imagination until they can no longer distinguish fantasy from reality. A facility  will help the most needy teenagers: Wallace House. Or at least that's how it looks like.
What happens in Wallace House? Why some of its guests are starting to show unique abilities that transcend human limits?
Meanwhile the city is under Smile gang control, led by the eccentric Lullaby. Arika is an orphan with a dire background. She’s tired of the cynicism and the apathy that pervades the city. So, she decides to step in and declares war on crime in Pacific City. Arika will be the enemy of the Smile gang: a conflict with unpredictable and unexpected results.

Chiara Colasanti 's drawing of Arika for GreenMoonArtist
Wallace House shows how heroes are not just made by superpowers or huge wealth: this story tells about the potential that each of us has got within themselves. The comic book tells about out-of-the-ordinary teenagers. Their passions and dreams are a source of courage, perseverance, and desire to prove themselves. And there is even an animal you will be surprised of: wait for a fantasy twist!
Wallace House is a story in three volumes of over 85 pages per volume. This comic book is suitable for all ages, a mix of many elements that comes from the nerd culture.
There’re many different traits and artists that alternate themselves in a perfect mix of humor and action, combined with a healthy dose of realism and introspection.

Introduction to some characters
LULLABY

The mysterious leader of the Smile band. In a few years he succeeded in imposing himself as the kingpin of Pacific City. Haunted by a troubled past, he floods the streets of the city with his anger and his drug, bringing hundreds of youngsters to destruction and killing anyone on his way. What hides the heavy makeup that covers the face of this sadistic and eccentric character? What links him to Wallace House?
JOE SANTANA

A melancholic middle-aged man who seems to have lost interest in life and other people. This troublesome guest of Wallace House with a grumpy and brusque nature is the nightmare of the recovery institution's staff. Much older than others living in the nursing home and apparently without psychic problems. What does he share with the others at Wallace House? What holds him in the building?
ARIKA

Don't call her snotty. The girl could cut you in so many pieces she could challenge the most Michelin starred chef in the world's tartare. So graceful as lethal, the girl can't stand anymore the dreariness in which Pacific City collapsed and decides to clean it up with martial arts and the steel of her katanas. What is the real reason behind her fight against the crime? Why does she fight against it with a cat on her side?

</p><h2>SYNOPSIS:
</h2>
<p>After the highly publicized death of his estranged uncle, Brian Baccino, a young and very
promising scientist, discovers that the man who raised him was not who he appeared to
be. Killed on the doorstep of the RDI Corporation, representatives from the
conglomerate deem the man a killer and a thief, calling the incident the consequences
of corporate espionage.
</p>
<p>Brian struggles to accept that the man he knew to be moral and just could not be
responsible for the things for which he is accused. After finding a letter from his uncle
contradicting those accusers, Brian becomes determined to find answers and sets out to
uncover the truth, braving death, tempting fate and retracing his uncle’s steps. Soon,
Brian finds himself scaling the walls of the technologies superpower and waist deep in a
conspiracy that may alter the lives of millions.
</p>
<p>Just when it appears he may be destined to share his uncle’s fate, Brian stumbles across
something extraordinary. He finds a suit, which once on, seems to allow its user to defy
the laws of physics. What he does not know, is that his discovery will soon make him the
tip of the spear in an all out battle for the not only his own survival, but for the fate and
future of entire human race.</p><p> </p>

These will be sold primarily in the 4 comic cons across India- Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi. Illustration(with coloring): $1200Though we have a great team of illustrators, none of them work for free :). Even then it comes to $15 per page which is only because of our relationship with them. Marketing & Incidentals: $300There is a lot of great stuff we want to give you guys for supporting this campaign. This, along with any Indiegogo admin cost and Shipping cost we need to pay, will also be covered in our budget.What happens if we fail to hit our funding goal?If we fall short then we most likely will be forced to reduce our initial printing run and possibly delay the launch of Parshu second arc in September at the Bangalore India Comic Con. Further due to funds crunch we will fall short of our aim to launch the Third Parshu arc in December at the Mumbai India Comic Con. However the more money we raise, the more money we can put into the second arc and plan our future arcs.   What is in it for me? We are deeply passionate about comics and storytelling, and believe that a lot needs to be done in the indian fantasy entertainment space. We have the talent, the capability, the right infrastructure and as the recent spate of superhero movies prove, the right demand as well. All we need now are people ready to make a dent in this industry, and we believe that as we are rightly placed. If you are someone who believes that the next marvel or DC is going to sprout from India, then we would like you to place faith in us and help us shape the future of content in fantasy entertainment space in india.   Risks & Challenges We are banking a lot on this Issue and believe it to be a major milestone for us. But there is clear chance that we might not be able to achieve what we have set out for, this year. But rest assured that we, Raveesh Mohan, Director and Priyank Loonker, Senior Partner will put in all their energies into making it a powerhouse of character based entertainment.   Other Ways You Can Help If for some reason you are not able to donate, do share this campaign with your friends and colleagues.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Temporal Comics was created to bring fun back to comics.</p>
<p>Our first venture is a multi-issue comic book featuring original profiles on public domain superheroes mostly from the golden age, but some will be silver age. We are going to include the most known, with full profiles, to unknowns that have very little information as they made only a few appearance and in some cases just one.</p>
<p>The most exciting part is the all-new artwork by Chris Malgrain. Many of the adventurers of the golden age were often drawn by sub-par artists - not everyone could hire Reed Crandall or Lou Fine. I have seen most of the art for our first issue and I promise you won't be disappointed. Just check a few sample pages below. I think you'll agree Chris does wonderful work.</p>
<p>The first issue will feature:</p>

<p>How many issues will we be doing?<br/>The project is open-ended as there are hundreds of public domain characters. The deciding factor will always be if we can raise funds to produce the comics. With your help, I think we are good hands. :)</p>

<p>We saw the sun rise, and called it God. We saw it move, and called us Center. Then stories, and myths, and happy little comforts- but they held us. Bound and in stupor we crept. Until, we learned the beauty of being wrong. It swept away the spell of firmament, until we finally gazed down upon our suspended world. We moved far, building, and changing other worlds. Slowly, did we do this, for the oceans and valleys of our world ill prepared us for the utter cold and licking heat of Space. And the dull, chill, quiet .  </p>
<p>     But still longing for a voice, the old melodies rang like brass bells in the minds of the lonely few. Contact made, a deal struck, and the lonely would return to their myths. Calamity and Choir. And so ended science, and the love of being wrong..  </p>
<p>     But such a legacy was not without its artifacts. A child was born on a satellite - our furthest reach from home. Ignorant to the dire transaction the world had made, she returns sleeping in her capsule.<b> Science, meet the Choir.</b></p>

<p><i><b>Too cryptic?</b></i> OK, I'll give away a bit more. <i>After the Gold Rush </i>tells the story of the Titan-born Scout, as she returns to her ancestral home of Earth. The first issue is a little more Twilight Zone than the rest of the series. But, like science, <i>After the Gold Rush </i>starts with a mystery. So that's all for now! </p>
<p>   As we have it planned, the story unfolds over twenty five issues. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">ATGR #1 is 22 pages, for the main story, with several pages of special features. We plan on doing a series of paper issues, digital issues, and trade paper backs later on. But this campaign is to get that all rolling! </span></p>

<p>   <i>After the Gold Rush</i> has three major goals. The first is to tell a good story that will matter. None of our other aspirations will manifest without a rich narrative. The motivations for ATGR are much more - but they are nothing without a rich narrative. </p>
<p>    At a con last year, I saw some wonderful and a few worrying trends in comics. The wonderful was the focus on perspectives from many different sub-cultures. I am a huge fan of Silver Age books; the early Marvel books created the artistic dialect for most of the medium. The good of this precedent is the optimistic Sci-Fi expansionism, heroic deeds, and fantastic ideas. The bad was that these wonderful stages lack diversity in their actors. This is now changing in Comics. But while I saw this inclusion for so many groups, I did not see a single book that was openly created by or for atheists, skeptics, and the hard science crowd.</p>
<p></p>
<div>    The worrying trend is fear. <b>Science has been playing the role of the atom bomb again, instead of the moon-lander</b>. Tomorrow will be dark, there will be zombies, the buildings around you will be empty, you will be scavenging, the robots are coming, there is no help, the future will crush us, technology will twist and defame us – The end is now.<b> No!</b> This is not how it’s going to be. I grew up watching Cosmos and Star Trek, and that’s the future I see. That is what I want to bring back.</div>

<b>After the Gold Rush #1 is complete, and printed</b>. Thanks to our other funding efforts we also have the bare-bones funding we need to keep the story going through Issue #4.

The funds from this <b>Indemand</b> campaign will go to further the book's ambitions. <p>If we meet out goal in this campaign we will have enough to take <i>After the Gold Rush</i> to more conventions - a critical part of an indie comic's progression.

</div></div>","We saw the sun rise, and called it God. We saw it move, and called us Center. Then stories, and myths, and happy little comforts- but they held us. Bound and in stupor we crept. Until, we learned the beauty of being wrong. It swept away the spell of firmament, until we finally gazed down upon our suspended world. We moved far, building, and changing other worlds. Slowly, did we do this, for the oceans and valleys of our world ill prepared us for the utter cold and licking heat of Space. And the dull, chill, quiet .  
     But still longing for a voice, the old melodies rang like brass bells in the minds of the lonely few. Contact made, a deal struck, and the lonely would return to their myths. Calamity and Choir. And so ended science, and the love of being wrong..  
     But such a legacy was not without its artifacts. A child was born on a satellite - our furthest reach from home. Ignorant to the dire transaction the world had made, she returns sleeping in her capsule. Science, meet the Choir.




Too cryptic? OK, I'll give away a bit more. After the Gold Rush tells the story of the Titan-born Scout, as she returns to her ancestral home of Earth. The first issue is a little more Twilight Zone than the rest of the series. But, like science, After the Gold Rush starts with a mystery. So that's all for now! 
   As we have it planned, the story unfolds over twenty five issues. ATGR #1 is 22 pages, for the main story, with several pages of special features. We plan on doing a series of paper issues, digital issues, and trade paper backs later on. But this campaign is to get that all rolling! 




   After the Gold Rush has three major goals. The first is to tell a good story that will matter. None of our other aspirations will manifest without a rich narrative. The motivations for ATGR are much more - but they are nothing without a rich narrative. 
    At a con last year, I saw some wonderful and a few worrying trends in comics. The wonderful was the focus on perspectives from many different sub-cultures. I am a huge fan of Silver Age books; the early Marvel books created the artistic dialect for most of the medium. The good of this precedent is the optimistic Sci-Fi expansionism, heroic deeds, and fantastic ideas. The bad was that these wonderful stages lack diversity in their actors. This is now changing in Comics. But while I saw this inclusion for so many groups, I did not see a single book that was openly created by or for atheists, skeptics, and the hard science crowd.

    The worrying trend is fear. Science has been playing the role of the atom bomb again, instead of the moon-lander. Tomorrow will be dark, there will be zombies, the buildings around you will be empty, you will be scavenging, the robots are coming, there is no help, the future will crush us, technology will twist and defame us – The end is now. No! This is not how it’s going to be. I grew up watching Cosmos and Star Trek, and that’s the future I see. That is what I want to bring back.





Miles Greb - Creator & Writer - Former Bob Dylan impersonator who's obsession with Star Trek is annoying to everyone. 
Isaac La Russa - Lead Artist & Concept Artist -Based in Illinois, he wears motley flannels and owns two ungrateful cats.
Michael Shepard - Colorist -  Very much like Mario Paint for SNES, but far more useful.
Andrew Pierce - Editor - Lovable goof and word-launderer. Escaped Kipling protagonist. 
Jamie Me - Lettering - Letterer who spends his time wearing pajamas called a 'gi' while learning the art of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
Michelle Man - Guest Artist - Former New Yorker, current San Fransisco-ER? Kinder towards plants and other people's animals than probably anyone she's met.
Barry Blankenship -Cover Artist & Logo Design - Amateur cursing cat ventriloquist.
Ben Rodgers - Assistant Editor - Historian of historical biographies, at least he was historically.
Poster Team - David Hovey and Chris Lewis Lee.

<p>Ski Ninjas is a comic strip that started in 2007, since 2012 has updated five days a week, free-now-and-forever, Monday to Friday. It's a no-plots, few-recurring-jokes, I-just-want-to-make-you-laugh strip. I want to make you laugh and not starve to death doing it!</p>
<p>I'm a cartoonist living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, who has been making comics for fun and profit since 2005. In 2012, Ski Ninjas was listed among the top five Canadian university comics by Maclean's On Campus. I have several comic series under my belt, and am currently working with Blood 2 Blood and AIDS Thunder Bay in producing a series of Hepatitis C awareness comics.</p>

<p>Look, the internet is great, I know it, you know it. But you don't want to print out the almost three hundred comics that I made in 2012 and staple them together. You can, but it's a dumb idea.</p>
<p>Forget I mentioned that.</p>
<p>I've added up the cost of printing and binding these guys, and it's downright reasonable for someone who has a regular day job and no super-cool ten year old daughters to feed. Guess which one of those things I have!</p>
<p>The content is there, the InDesign template for putting the content in book form is there, the bonus content is clogging up my computer. The only thing missing is YOU!</p>
<p>I've been making comics since 2005, and right now, Ski Ninjas is my baby. My baby with a terrible name that doesn't make sense (like Pilot Inspektor). I'm coming up on my five hundredth strip, but other than some tiny little minicomics, there has never been a collection of any of these, or any of my work.

<p>Hey all doxy here! Living in japan, and making doujins.</p>
<p>Been in the adult art industry for 10+ years. Creating and print Doujin's in japan is a new thing for me and I felt my western fan base may be interested in the process. THE GOAL here is to print the doujin, send it to those who ordered a copy and put the book in doujin stores and sell them in comic conventions. </p>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Pooters is a series of comics by well known erotic artist Butcha-u/eroquis. Many in the west are familiar with it and I suggest you check out his works. My fan comic is a futa version of his works and is 10 pages long. Additional pages will be added with increasing support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How do I get a copy?!</h3>
<p>I need about 800usd to make a proper run of 200 copies or more. If you support for a physical copy you will get a physical copy. Simple as that!</p>
<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>

<strong>Will it be censored?</strong><ul><li>Yes the print edition will. All adult works in Japan and must be censored. Digital editions will be uncensored.</li></ul>

<strong>Will it be Japanese?</strong><ul><li>Print edition will be Japanese.

<strong>Why is it so expensive to ship?</strong><ul><li>Shipping is just expensive and it also include shipping material and time spent shipping.  Reduction in price may be possible for North America but the rest of the world will be tough to reduce.</li></ul>

Risks & ChallengesI forgot few issues for this project as I've printed multiple books before and managed several funders successfully.

</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The general idea for this project is to create a collection of the first five episodes of UIR (with extra content) for readers to enjoy. The series was created with the intent of always coming to print, so its content was made as traditional pages first before becoming reformatted for being a vertical webcomic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The upside is, because the already print based pages exist, the process itself should be easy. All this is is getting the already future proofed pages to print, as well as getting them touched up..</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">But to summarize, these are basic points I’m wanting to achieve.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>GOALS:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Create a 200 paged paper trade containing the first five episodes, plus bonus content</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Update the art and improve the quality (Regardless of the campaign’s success, these art updates and fixes will be uploaded to the official webcomic either way)</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Fund for a bare minimum of 200 books for readers</li>
<li style=""text-align: center;"">Ship books to US and Canada (Minimum goal)</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Despite a dedicated fan base, UIR’s reader base is small compared to others, so I’m keeping the goals small and focused for now. If the demand is higher I’ll be sure to ship more books out, this is all just a baseline goal for the project. I find trying to add too much often causes a downfall and delays for a project. That’s why I’ve waited to make sure I had the content ready for the most part instead of just only now redoing the comic to be for print and potentially causing more issues and delays.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I don’t intend for this to be a simple collection either, I wanna make sure that this volume is the best way to enjoy the series. Which is why I’ll be making sure to clean up the art, add some behind the scenes stuff, new story bits, and so on.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">UIR as a whole has been an artistic evolution, the first three episodes especially having different styles from one another.

THE TALE OF THE MAN WITH AN UNBREAKABLE WILL
“It's a mad, mad world; one that needs a man with an unbreakable will, an undying body, and an unstoppable resolve. This is the tale of the Unbreakable, Iron Ranger!”
Unbreakable Iron Ranger follows the story of Ben Young, a youth of 21 who seeks to protect the underworld of monsters and crypts at the behest of his late grandfather, Dr. Fleetwood. An intended product of destruction for his undying body, Ben heads off into the world to make sure that no one follows in the path of Dr. Styx who tried to use crypts like him for world domination. 
However, as he begins his journey he discovers what dangers await in the world, and that the mad doctor that Fleetwood took care of may not be dead after all...

The general idea for this project is to create a collection of the first five episodes of UIR (with extra content) for readers to enjoy. The series was created with the intent of always coming to print, so its content was made as traditional pages first before becoming reformatted for being a vertical webcomic.
The upside is, because the already print based pages exist, the process itself should be easy. All this is is getting the already future proofed pages to print, as well as getting them touched up..
But to summarize, these are basic points I’m wanting to achieve.
GOALS:

Create a 200 paged paper trade containing the first five episodes, plus bonus content
Update the art and improve the quality (Regardless of the campaign’s success, these art updates and fixes will be uploaded to the official webcomic either way)
Fund for a bare minimum of 200 books for readers

Despite a dedicated fan base, UIR’s reader base is small compared to others, so I’m keeping the goals small and focused for now. If the demand is higher I’ll be sure to ship more books out, this is all just a baseline goal for the project. I find trying to add too much often causes a downfall and delays for a project. That’s why I’ve waited to make sure I had the content ready for the most part instead of just only now redoing the comic to be for print and potentially causing more issues and delays.
I don’t intend for this to be a simple collection either, I wanna make sure that this volume is the best way to enjoy the series. Which is why I’ll be making sure to clean up the art, add some behind the scenes stuff, new story bits, and so on.
Here’s what y’all will be getting if you back this...
 
THE DEFINITIVE UNBREAKABLE IRON RANGER EXPERIENCE
 
UPDATED ART:

UIR as a whole has been an artistic evolution, the first three episodes especially having different styles from one another. I want to preserve the art as much as possible, but some changes have to be made to make it more professional. Most of this is just cleaned up art and some fixes to match the current style more without changing too much.

However, some pages WILL be needing a much needed overhaul, such as the splash pages. Just as an example, here’s Barry’s entrance (one of the villain’s in the comic) as it was done in 2018.
 
Now, here’s the overhauled page as of 2020 to better illustrate his daunting size and appearance dwarfing over our titular and comparatively diminutive hero.

 
In essence, that’s what these fixes are being used for. To enhance the original without messing too much with the overall art where I would have to back and change everything. The whole idea is to preserve as much as possible while making it look more professional and higher quality.




Even if the campaign doesn’t work out, these changes will be applied to the comic when the campaign ends. That’s a promise. 
 
VARIANT COVERS
Included in this volume there will be awesome and dynamic variant covers to go along with each episode made by guest artists. There will be the proper covers and the alternate covers which also be used on the main webcomic.

This daunting and foreboding piece for Episode 1 I had commissioned  from my good bud WhatAHero, the creator of the hit Tapas series The Witch’s Throne (https://tapas.io/series/thewitchsthrone)
The Episode 3 one was done by Shaoz, and the Episode 5 one was done by Captain Ahab, both talented freelance artists, and both of them you can find on twitter! (@AhabsArtwork and @ShaozChampion)
. Besides these covers there are two other amazing covers I can’t wait to show you when the time is right, they are still being worked on as we speak!
 
 
BEHIND THE SCENES CONTENT:
 
Get some behind the scenes content with this volume, including author’s notes as well as thoughts from our editor Delta (he’s been a huge factor in making sure UIR is in top quality and dealing with my bull), and some concept art involving the episodes, key art, eyecatches and more.



 
FANART:
Fanart from the fans of the series will be included as well! This isn’t a tier reward either, we’re featuring art from the fans, mainly of course featuring art from the first five episodes to fit with the volume. If you made fanart, this will be your time show it off!
 
I’ll be working on a proper means to collect the fanart, updates on that soon.
 
STRETCH GOALS:
 
Some campaigns get more than enough funding needed. If we hit these marks before the end, here’s what will happen. More will happen if succeed the goal and the current stretch goal, but for now here it is.
15,000 - PAPER TRADES UPGRADED TO HARD COPIES
These are at the end of the day stretch goals, they are the icing on the cake. The main focus is the main volume with five episodes and bonus content, but if we can surpass these marks that would be amazing. If more stretch goals are made more may be considered depending on the demand.
 
RISKS
Look these projects will always come with risk and reward. With COVID-19 having impacted things so much and for so long it may end up causing delays. Gonna be keeping y’all up to date weekly on what the situation is, as well as providing progress on the project too. To make sure backers stay safe this is a fixed campaign, meaning if we don’t make our goal your money goes back to you. Refunds will also be offered during the campaign, as well as the first two weeks. After that the sales are final, set in stone.  
As said though there won’t be any art delays on the main pages, and variants are already underway with three more to go. Most of the potential delays will come with the printing and shipping for the books and rewards, the art itself is fine as that will be done during the campaign, not after.
To also note, the planned campaign will go as such

SEPTEMBER 4th - OCTOBER 19th: The initial campaign
OCTOBER 19 - NOVEMBER 2: Collecting funds and dishing out final refunds if needed, the PDFs being emailed to backers.
NOVEMBER - DECEMBER PERIOD: All rewards and products ship to the backers.

<h3>THE DEFINITIVE WALL-MIGHT TRILOGY</h3>
<p>In the spring of 2018, following the success of their book <i><strong><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Thump-First-Bundred-Timothy-Lim/dp/1682615227/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3VHMEYLEBIIJY&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=thump+the+first+bundred+days&amp;qid=1590466136&amp;sprefix=thump+the+first%2Caps%2C174&amp;sr=8-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Thump: The First Bundred Days</a></strong></i>, first time creators <strong>Timothy Lim</strong> and <strong>Mark Pellegrini</strong> were encouraged by friends at <strong>Antarctic Press</strong> to take their unique brand of illustrated political humor to produce their first comic. That book was the best-selling, 8-time printed comic<i> <strong><a href=""https://antarctic-press.myshopify.com/search?type=product&amp;q=my+hero+magademia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My Hero MAGAdemia: Wall-Might</a></strong>.</i></p>

<p>Created, drawn, and colored by <strong>Timothy Lim</strong> and written and co-created by <strong>Mark Pellegrini </strong>with additional colors by <strong>Brett R. Smith</strong>, <i><strong>My Hero MAGAdemia</strong></i> became one of the most wildly successful political comics in recent years, filling in a much-needed market gap at the cross-section of politics and pop culture.</p>
<p>Since then, the duo of Lim and Pellegrini have gone on to collaborate on <strong>10 books</strong> in the last <strong>2 years</strong>. Two <i>hobbyists</i> -- non professionals -- have produced or have been involved in the following works in their spare time, all stemming from <i>one</i> political parody:</p>
<ul>
<li>My Hero MAGAdemia</li>
<li>Black Hops: Buns of the Patriots #1</li>
<li>Black Hops: Buns of the Patriots #2</li>
<li>Trump's Space Force</li>
<li>Wall-Might: First Term, Part 2</li>
<li>Soulfinder: Demon's Match</li>
<li>Black Hops, Volume 2: Hare Trigger</li>
<li>Kamen America, Volume 1: Stars and Strife</li>
<li>Wall-Might 3: The MAGAlorian</li>
<li>Black Hops, Volume 3: Hopocalypse Now</li>
</ul>
<p>Their most recent work in publication, <strong>Kamen America</strong>, was a direct spin-off of the Wall-Might series. It has gone on to sell more than 2,000 copies -- digital and physical -- solely on the direct, independent market between Kickstarter and IndieGoGo pre-orders. A sequel is planned for the fall, as well as a retail printing.</p>

<p><i><strong>My Hero MAGAdemia</strong></i>, <i><strong>Wall-Might</strong></i>, and <i><strong>Wall-Might 3: The MAGAlorian</strong></i> chronicle the rise of <i>Donaldus Magnus</i> after receiving the legacy ability known as the <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>. Granted the power of the people, he turns into the American champion <strong>Wall-Might</strong> as he works tirelessly for its citizens. Together with his wife -- FLOTUS -- and young protege, Maiku-Kun, he faces a rogues gallery of Deep State operatives, greasy politicians, and malicious Marxists through 100+ pages of greatness.</p>
<p>The best, really, everyone agrees.</p>

<p>The <strong>Wall-Might</strong> trilogy means a lot to us. It marks the conclusion of our political parodies while at the same time celebrating the root of our success: it is a physical example, we feel, of how anything can done well if treated seriously (even a farce, comedy, or parody). We have this series to thank for our 2 years of content and for being the springboard for countless ideas: for you, we hope that the the humor in our storytelling serves as a reminder of the roller coaster ride in the world of politics from 2016 to 2020.</p>
</div></div>","THE DEFINITIVE WALL-MIGHT TRILOGY
In the spring of 2018, following the success of their book Thump: The First Bundred Days, first time creators Timothy Lim and Mark Pellegrini were encouraged by friends at Antarctic Press to take their unique brand of illustrated political humor to produce their first comic. That book was the best-selling, 8-time printed comic My Hero MAGAdemia: Wall-Might.

Created, drawn, and colored by Timothy Lim and written and co-created by Mark Pellegrini with additional colors by Brett R. Smith, My Hero MAGAdemia became one of the most wildly successful political comics in recent years, filling in a much-needed market gap at the cross-section of politics and pop culture.
Since then, the duo of Lim and Pellegrini have gone on to collaborate on 10 books in the last 2 years. Two hobbyists -- non professionals -- have produced or have been involved in the following works in their spare time, all stemming from one political parody:

My Hero MAGAdemia
Black Hops: Buns of the Patriots #1
Black Hops: Buns of the Patriots #2
Trump's Space Force
Wall-Might: First Term, Part 2
Soulfinder: Demon's Match
Black Hops, Volume 2: Hare Trigger
Kamen America, Volume 1: Stars and Strife
Wall-Might 3: The MAGAlorian
Black Hops, Volume 3: Hopocalypse Now

Their most recent work in publication, Kamen America, was a direct spin-off of the Wall-Might series. It has gone on to sell more than 2,000 copies -- digital and physical -- solely on the direct, independent market between Kickstarter and IndieGoGo pre-orders. A sequel is planned for the fall, as well as a retail printing.

Now, for the first time, the Wall-Might Trilogy is collected in one definitive volume.


My Hero MAGAdemia, Wall-Might, and Wall-Might 3: The MAGAlorian chronicle the rise of Donaldus Magnus after receiving the legacy ability known as the E Pluribus Unum. Granted the power of the people, he turns into the American champion Wall-Might as he works tirelessly for its citizens. Together with his wife -- FLOTUS -- and young protege, Maiku-Kun, he faces a rogues gallery of Deep State operatives, greasy politicians, and malicious Marxists through 100+ pages of greatness.
The best, really, everyone agrees.






Here's the deal with what you'll be getting:

The collected, original printings of My Hero MAGAdemia: Wall-Might, Wall-Might: First Term, Part II (the complete crowdfunded version), Wall-Might 3: The MAGAlorian (includes Wall-Might Side Story: GOPlin Slayer written by R.D. and Raymond Porse)
That's 110+ pages. HUGE!
All original covers and supplemental material, including the virgin version of Dave Dorman's MAGAlorian cover
Square-bound, with a fancy surprise on the cover. Probably gold.
A sticker with every physical purchase. Believe me, so good.
First 50 backers will receive a Trump's Space Force patch, from the first campaign we were affiliated with!
Delivered on time. Everything's already done and going to print!

<p>Being an English teacher and former professor of Religion, I've put a lot of myself into The RE-Creation Project, my thoughts and ideas, matters that I have considered, but not as a method to evangelize because there's <i>no religion </i>dominant in the story. Rather, The RE-Creation Project is a religious and philosophical manifesto in comic book form that seeks to explore the human condition and all its potential, from the baseness of our instinct for survival to the high reaching possibility of our own divinity. This story is meant to challenge its readers as the characters course through some of humanity's worst fears come true.</p>
<p>The RE-Creation Project Issue 1 is a 32 page full-color comic. For right now, the story will be a five issue series created and written by me with art from Morgan Sawyer and Scappatticci.  The book is finished and we are seeking funding for production and distribution. This is truly an indie comic looking to find its niche and audience. </p>

<h3>Building the Junkyard</h3>
<p> </p>
<p class=""p1""> Art is my life. It provides me with comfort through difficult times and satisfies my creative impulses. It enables my imagination to soar and serves as a platform of inspiration to others. My art has allowed me to explore a great part of the United States and with access to the internet, art helped me to connect with so many people around the world! It has taken me to festivals in New York City and generated conversations between strangers and attracted the attention of curious children. Art has given me experiences to share.</p>
<p class=""p1"">   I began to win art contests in elementary school and my work began to sell in high school. Although my parents couldn’t afford to enroll me into an art school, I continued to create! I supported my work while performing janitorial tasks and as a laborer. The only happiness I discovered in any of those jobs, were through the friends I made with my art and the money they provided to purchase my supplies.</p>
<p class=""p1""><em>   Junkyard</em> began in 1998 while working as a screen printer. I left work and went directly to New York Music to make my last payment on a Fender Stratocaster, a guitar I have wanted to own since I was a teenager. I stopped at Sully’s for dinner and didn’t want to leave the guitar in my vehicle, so I brought into the restaurant with me. A woman sitting a couple of tables over referred to me as a street rat and his guitar. My vision had arrived! Eugene “Blind Mellow” Jefferson was born!</p>
<p class=""p1"">   As <em>Junkyard </em>developed, so did my artistic skills! I began to work in the third dimension by sculpting the characters with polymer clay. I was so excited when I completed a whole set of 12! I showed them to my friends and family asked what I was planning to do with them. I created packaging for them and began took them to a few local craft shows. Children gravitated to them and parents asked how much are they. I knew that if I could get them massed produced, I could sell them all day long! Many others asked for the story surrounding them. I could only share a small amount of it in words because I didn’t have a book created to share with them. </p>
<p class=""p1"">   In 2009, my job was lost due to a continuing lack of business. I went to school to learn how to put <em>Junkyard</em> together for a book or a cartoon. While attending ITT Technical Institute, I even assembled <em>Junkyard</em> into a board game! Before graduation, we had the chance to present our work at an open house. The whole <em>Junkyard</em> theme gained a lot of attention and the same feedback. It has huge potential, but money and location are two revolving stumbling blocks. </p>
<p class=""p1"">   The amount of money I need to generate complete this mission is way out of my reach. I am hoping to bring my Junkyard dream into reality with your generous support. Together, we will inspire others with an uplifting story of courage and hope!</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Fleeing the oppression of WWII Germany, Avery and her parents move to a remote town on the border of France. It is here she finds her new best friend, a cat named Nook. But, there is more to this cat than it seems.</p>
<p>Avery is swept up into a deadly cycle of violence, and she will come to both fear and love her fuzzy new friend as the dark and twisted history of her new home is revealed.</p>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>This story is a culmination of demented dreams, family history, and my love for Guillermo del Toro's style of storytelling. From The Devil's Backbone to Pan's Labyrinth and Crimson Peak, I love the way he uses ghosts and mystical creatures to create an atmosphere of terror to reflect deeper meanings and develop tragic stories. I'm always intrigued by stories that appear to be scary on the surface but have many more layers and meanings. </p>
<p>Nook is inspired by these stories, and I hope when you experience it you will discover that there is much more to this little tale than meets the eye.</p>
<h3>The Cycle Repeats</h3>
<p>This book has become very timely and universaly relateable. It explores the cyclical nature of human tragedy and how we are doomed to repeat the past if we cannot learn from it.</p>
<p>Marcelo and I started work on this book through Patreon about a year and a half ago. We had no idea how timely the story would become. This is the tale of refugees and survivors; families torn apart by violence, greed, and hate. </p>
<p>Sadly... the cycle is constantly repeating in our world.</p>

Fleeing the oppression of WWII Germany, Avery and her parents move to a remote town on the border of France. It is here she finds her new best friend, a cat named Nook. But, there is more to this cat than it seems.
Avery is swept up into a deadly cycle of violence, and she will come to both fear and love her fuzzy new friend as the dark and twisted history of her new home is revealed.
Origins
This story is a culmination of demented dreams, family history, and my love for Guillermo del Toro's style of storytelling. From The Devil's Backbone to Pan's Labyrinth and Crimson Peak, I love the way he uses ghosts and mystical creatures to create an atmosphere of terror to reflect deeper meanings and develop tragic stories. I'm always intrigued by stories that appear to be scary on the surface but have many more layers and meanings. 
Nook is inspired by these stories, and I hope when you experience it you will discover that there is much more to this little tale than meets the eye.
The Cycle Repeats
This book has become very timely and universaly relateable. It explores the cyclical nature of human tragedy and how we are doomed to repeat the past if we cannot learn from it.
Marcelo and I started work on this book through Patreon about a year and a half ago. We had no idea how timely the story would become. This is the tale of refugees and survivors; families torn apart by violence, greed, and hate. 
Sadly... the cycle is constantly repeating in our world.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Fear is what keeps good men from being <i>great</i> men. We’ve all faced a situation where we saw someone who needed our help, and yet we did nothing because of our biological imperative for self-preservation. Our heart knows what’s right - our brain knows what’s smart, and ultimately the brain wins out every time death is a possibility. But what if death was no longer a factor? Would we then always do what was right, now that we’re free from mortal consequence?</p>
<p>Everlasting Survivors explores these questions, among other topics not yet fully examined by the comic book medium. The book follows three heroes, all of whom possess an eclectic assortment of powers, with one unifying characteristic; if they die, they will resurrect with even more abilities than before. Death, then, has become something not to fear, but rather something to look forward to.</p>
<p>When we’re first introduced to the characters, they have yet to understand how they got their powers and what these new powers mean for mankind’s future. As the story unfolds, our heroes search for these answers while coming face-to-face with even bigger questions, like: What does sacrifice mean when you have nothing to lose?</p>

<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our heroes are Dominic Kanuho, Reece Shaw and Faviana “Ana” Maldonado. Dominic and Reece both fully embrace the limelight that their newfound powers have provided them, and with the help of an image consulting firm (ran by Reece and Ana’s sister Marie), use their powers for both the good of the people and for the adoration of their fans. Ana is different. She wears a mask and uses a code name - Sublime Eye - so that she can still be a nurse in her everyday life without being inundated by the fame that comes with her alter ego.</p>
<p>Their world is much like ours; pessimistic, cynical, seemingly hopeless, cruel and confusing and filled with lies, deceit, malice and greed. The inhabitants of this world need a savior, whether they realize it or not. Are these heroes ready to answer that unspoken call?</p>

Would we then always do what was right, now that we’re free from mortal consequence?
Everlasting Survivors explores these questions, among other topics not yet fully examined by the comic book medium. The book follows three heroes, all of whom possess an eclectic assortment of powers, with one unifying characteristic; if they die, they will resurrect with even more abilities than before. Death, then, has become something not to fear, but rather something to look forward to.
When we’re first introduced to the characters, they have yet to understand how they got their powers and what these new powers mean for mankind’s future. As the story unfolds, our heroes search for these answers while coming face-to-face with even bigger questions, like: What does sacrifice mean when you have nothing to lose?





Overview
 
Our heroes are Dominic Kanuho, Reece Shaw and Faviana “Ana” Maldonado. Dominic and Reece both fully embrace the limelight that their newfound powers have provided them, and with the help of an image consulting firm (ran by Reece and Ana’s sister Marie), use their powers for both the good of the people and for the adoration of their fans. Ana is different. She wears a mask and uses a code name - Sublime Eye - so that she can still be a nurse in her everyday life without being inundated by the fame that comes with her alter ego.
Their world is much like ours; pessimistic, cynical, seemingly hopeless, cruel and confusing and filled with lies, deceit, malice and greed. The inhabitants of this world need a savior, whether they realize it or not. Are these heroes ready to answer that unspoken call?

Risks & Challenges
 
       I got the largest obstacles out of the way all art has been COMPLETED.
       The biggest risk we face is NOT getting the printing cost covered.
       The team is working hard to face the challenge of getting the word out about this.
       Addition risk comes from shipping anything can happen especially in a COVID world.

<div><br/></div>
<div>See the comics Im making with the money raised in this campaign over at<a href=""http://tapastic.com/ashleyknapp9465"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Tapastic</a>, including Agents, Emi and Emma's spooky stories, Little Lee Hourly, and many more to come! </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Final Campaign Update</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>   The funds have been put to good use buying the printer/scanner combo, as seen in the brand new video. I am still working on comics and as soon as I finish the first issue I will send it out to all supporters in digital format, as well as asking again for an redeemable personalized perks. Thanks again for visiting!  Get ahold of me on twitter via @CtrlAltLee, on deviantart as AshleyAKnapp, or thru a comment on my website AshleyAKnapp.com . Thanks again! </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">POST-CAMPAIGN UPDATE</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Thanks! </b></div>
<div>The campaign is over! Thanks to Alex, Scott, and the Anon who donated! It kept me energized and excited to work on this throughout the month. You have given me confidence that my work is worthwhile and I have room to improve. Also thanks to the promoters who spread the word of the campaign. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Results</b></div>
<div> Despite the support, I didn't reach my goal of $320, so I debated a bit about which of the things I listed I'm going to purchase to improve my art work.  </div>
<div>After some thinking about it, I'm going to purchase the scanner/printer combo.  This seems like the most practical purchase, since not only will it allow me to print out things like tickets, coupons, recipes, minicomics, and cards, but it will allow me to scan in traditional artwork that is jumbo sized. </div>
<div>This will allow me to have original artwork for some of my series ( though some of them will still be all digital ) that I can preserve as art artifacts, or auction/sell/gift if my comics become popular in the future.  This will provide the potential for a future revenue stream to help my comics work become self-sustaining. </div>
<div>Plus. my last scanner/printer lasted for around 7 years, so this will be a long term investment not likely to be out moded by technologies ever more rapid pace, like software or a webcam might be. </div>
<div><b>What I Learned</b></div>
<div>Although I raised 50% of my goal, I had a few large donors rather then lots of small donors. After analyzing InSights, the promoter perks I was doing actually didn't bring in much traffic at all. This isn't a huge loss, since I enjoyed doing the perks, but it makes me realize that this isn't an effective way of promoting my campaign. I only had around 600 views total, which is less than the amount I got on a daily update for my old fancomic.</div>
<div>Another troubling aspect is that after running through initial responses on Gaia and DeviantArt forums and clubs, people stopped asking for free art. Both of the threads were dead by the end.  I know this isn't because my art is completely undesirable, as I've gotten paid gigs in the past. </div>
<div>Perhaps making it free was too devaluing to the art, perhaps the fact that the promoter perks were unfinished pieces was another turn-off, or maybe it was the sites user base. I had absolutely no response on tumblr, twitter, or google plus. I need more engagement on all of these platforms.</div>
<div>My family was really supportive with this project, and I really appreciate the monetary and emotional encouragement to proceed with this project.</div>
<div><b>How Will I Apply This Knowledge?</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Engagement and Entertainment are the two words on my mind. I need to give more to my followers/friends on the various social networks. Not only by supporting and following their work, but by providing entertainment as well. </div>
<div>I think I need a series that updates weekly that can grow momentum like my old fan comic. However, I also need a way for people that are unfamiliar with me to find me accessible. </div>
<div>The clear answer to this, looking at others around me, is fan art. In this vein, I've gotten back into doing a quick fanart sketch at the end of the night on a near-daily basis, and tagging them. None of them have had a huge response yet, but as my work and consistency improves I think I will find new people.  </div>
<div>However, most of my time is devoted to original content still, and I am creating a huge buffer of comic content so that I can start sharing my ideas again.  I am penciling every day. I am also continuing to outline and thumbnail future issues. I am continuing to warm up with reference or learning drawing for thirty minutes a day.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>to Wrap It All up</b></div>
<div>Thanks to everyone who supported me, both financial and exposure wise! If and when I run a campaign again, I will ensure that I have more work to share, and have readers who are attached to said work. Getting this scanner/printer will be a huge step forward, not only providing a basic technology that is essential in many homes, but allowing me to fulfill a want I've had for years to be able to scan large sized bristol pages. Thanks so much for reading and the suppport! I will send out another round of notices for perk purchasers who have earned custom comics. These are redeemable until 2015. They will also receive digital copies of any comics I finish between now and 2015. </div>

My scanner, which I've been using since 2008, also broke beyond repair two weeks ago. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> I tried the trial of manga studio ex 5 and love it so far! It's amazingly intuitive and I feel like I could make much better comics much faster if I had a copy.  Since I only used Photoshop for illustration, this software seems like a good choice, and it comes highly recommended. </span>
</li> <li>Now the only obstacle keeping me from making comics like a madwomen is the fact that it is the trial version and I cannot, in fact, save anything I make yet. </li> </ul>
<p>Thank you for reading all that! But this isn't all about me, I'm offering some great perks to those that help me out! First I'll break down what I'll be investing in with your help, and then I'll detail what you receive in return. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need</h3> <p>Here's where the $500 I'm raising will go:</p> <ul>

See the comics Im making with the money raised in this campaign over at Tapastic, including Agents, Emi and Emma's spooky stories, Little Lee Hourly, and many more to come! 

Final Campaign Update


   The funds have been put to good use buying the printer/scanner combo, as seen in the brand new video. I am still working on comics and as soon as I finish the first issue I will send it out to all supporters in digital format, as well as asking again for an redeemable personalized perks. Thanks again for visiting!  Get ahold of me on twitter via @CtrlAltLee, on deviantart as AshleyAKnapp, or thru a comment on my website AshleyAKnapp.com . Thanks again! 
POST-CAMPAIGN UPDATE

Thanks! 
The campaign is over! Thanks to Alex, Scott, and the Anon who donated! It kept me energized and excited to work on this throughout the month. You have given me confidence that my work is worthwhile and I have room to improve. Also thanks to the promoters who spread the word of the campaign. 

Results
 Despite the support, I didn't reach my goal of $320, so I debated a bit about which of the things I listed I'm going to purchase to improve my art work.  
After some thinking about it, I'm going to purchase the scanner/printer combo.  This seems like the most practical purchase, since not only will it allow me to print out things like tickets, coupons, recipes, minicomics, and cards, but it will allow me to scan in traditional artwork that is jumbo sized. 
This will allow me to have original artwork for some of my series ( though some of them will still be all digital ) that I can preserve as art artifacts, or auction/sell/gift if my comics become popular in the future.  This will provide the potential for a future revenue stream to help my comics work become self-sustaining. 
Plus. my last scanner/printer lasted for around 7 years, so this will be a long term investment not likely to be out moded by technologies ever more rapid pace, like software or a webcam might be. 
What I Learned
Although I raised 50% of my goal, I had a few large donors rather then lots of small donors. After analyzing InSights, the promoter perks I was doing actually didn't bring in much traffic at all. This isn't a huge loss, since I enjoyed doing the perks, but it makes me realize that this isn't an effective way of promoting my campaign. I only had around 600 views total, which is less than the amount I got on a daily update for my old fancomic.
Another troubling aspect is that after running through initial responses on Gaia and DeviantArt forums and clubs, people stopped asking for free art. Both of the threads were dead by the end.  I know this isn't because my art is completely undesirable, as I've gotten paid gigs in the past. 
Perhaps making it free was too devaluing to the art, perhaps the fact that the promoter perks were unfinished pieces was another turn-off, or maybe it was the sites user base. I had absolutely no response on tumblr, twitter, or google plus. I need more engagement on all of these platforms.
My family was really supportive with this project, and I really appreciate the monetary and emotional encouragement to proceed with this project.
How Will I Apply This Knowledge?

Engagement and Entertainment are the two words on my mind. I need to give more to my followers/friends on the various social networks. Not only by supporting and following their work, but by providing entertainment as well. 
I think I need a series that updates weekly that can grow momentum like my old fan comic. However, I also need a way for people that are unfamiliar with me to find me accessible. 
The clear answer to this, looking at others around me, is fan art. In this vein, I've gotten back into doing a quick fanart sketch at the end of the night on a near-daily basis, and tagging them. None of them have had a huge response yet, but as my work and consistency improves I think I will find new people.  
However, most of my time is devoted to original content still, and I am creating a huge buffer of comic content so that I can start sharing my ideas again.  I am penciling every day. I am also continuing to outline and thumbnail future issues. I am continuing to warm up with reference or learning drawing for thirty minutes a day.


to Wrap It All up
Thanks to everyone who supported me, both financial and exposure wise! If and when I run a campaign again, I will ensure that I have more work to share, and have readers who are attached to said work. Getting this scanner/printer will be a huge step forward, not only providing a basic technology that is essential in many homes, but allowing me to fulfill a want I've had for years to be able to scan large sized bristol pages. Thanks so much for reading and the suppport! I will send out another round of notices for perk purchasers who have earned custom comics. These are redeemable until 2015. They will also receive digital copies of any comics I finish between now and 2015. 



I crave manga. Manga Studio EX 5 to be exact. And a scanner. Thanks so much for visiting my page! Read on to find all about this fundraiser/commission sale! 
Hi! I'm Ashley A Knapp. I'm a home-maker/artist. You might recognize me from around the web by my other pseudonyms, like CtrlAltLee. You can find me on various sites like youtube, deviantart, tumblr, and twitter. I'm passionate about comics and storytelling. I'm a frequent commenter on lifedrawing youtube series croquis cafe and even a one time  guest on comics podcast lean into art.  I'm ready to start my next comic series!  I graduated college last winter and my student copy of Adobe Photoshop CS 5 ( the software I used to use to draw comics ) has expired. My scanner, which I've been using since 2008, also broke beyond repair two weeks ago.  I tried the trial of manga studio ex 5 and love it so far! It's amazingly intuitive and I feel like I could make much better comics much faster if I had a copy.  Since I only used Photoshop for illustration, this software seems like a good choice, and it comes highly recommended. 
 Now the only obstacle keeping me from making comics like a madwomen is the fact that it is the trial version and I cannot, in fact, save anything I make yet.  
Thank you for reading all that! But this isn't all about me, I'm offering some great perks to those that help me out! First I'll break down what I'll be investing in with your help, and then I'll detail what you receive in return.    What I Need Here's where the $500 I'm raising will go: 
Manga Studio EX 5 costs $299.99 on Smith macro's website, but I shopped around and found a physical copy on Amazon for about $90. I need $90 to get it. 




I would like to get a large format scanner so that I can draw and scan in on larger pieces of bristol board for pencils and traditional art pieces.  Many comic artists draw on bristol much larger then your letter sized scanner can handle.  I would like to buy this scanner/printer combo which has a larger 11x17 inch scan bed.  It is $300.00 normally, but only $230.00 on sale and has free shipping.






For those of you good at math, you'll notice that's only $320.00, leaving $180 left over. What would that be used for? 
BONUS

The remainder would go towards a high quality, hi-def web cam with mic so that I could broadcast my work flow during the day. I've already done some screen casting, but with a high end web cam with a good mic I could show both screen work and traditional art, enabling the ability for  all day shows on twitch, ustream, livestream, or google hangouts. The webcam I am considering is this one. If we reach this bonus I promise at least one 4-6 hour slot every week while I'll do requests for free live. 





 What if we do not reach $320?
( Strike through goals have already been achieved! Everyone is AWESOME! Thanks so much for how far we've gotten so far! ) 


If I don't reach my goal, I will purchase the tools I need to make comics in this order...  
$0-$20: Buy more india ink to traditionally do my comics that will only be seen via photos because I have no way to scan or letter them
$20-70: Buy Manga Studio 5 ( not EX 5 )  
$80-$200: Buy Manga Studio EX5
$200-$300: Buy Manga Studio EX 5 and a webcam that fits into budget of what is leftover
$320: Silly, that's the original goal! 

 All those pennies add up to comics pages
 As you can see no dollar is wasted, as I plan to put every penny towards creating art. Getting Manga Studio and the Scanner will enable me to share  the work easier with the world.  
Comics for everyone to read!  When I start a project, I see it through to the end. Jackie Spicer might have been a silly fancomic, but it was a silly fancomic that updated almost daily for three years and saw it's conclusion posted, not fading into the ether unresolved like so many web comics do. If you get me this software and hardware I will make  sharing the comics I make with you my number one priority once again. this time with original characters and their stories straight from my heart. 
( Page 4 and page 500 of Jackie Spicer, roughly.  This is an example of my commitment, as it's from 2012 and no longer reflects my art ability.  For an example of the projects put on hiatus by my photoshop failure that would be resurrected if this campaign succeeds, see Dowry Quest and Sya Comic)

<h3>UPDATE #1:</h3>
<p>First off, a HUGE thank you to those who have donated thus far. You are all the best!</p>
<p>Secondly, I've got a printer now so I'm one step closer to making this thing a reality! I'll be getting the toner/paper/staples and such soon and will get down to making some test books later in the month.</p>
<p>-Matt</p>
<h3>Who's this guy? What's his story?</h3>
<p>My name is Matt Cummings and I'm a freelance illustrator from Nova Scotia, Canada.</p>
<p>In 2010 I started a webcomic called Bluenose. It's a fun adventure story featuring vegetable witches, robotic dogs and a dude made of corn!</p>
<p>To date, Bluenose has 3 chapters and 250+ pages. I had to take a haitus from the comic due to time contraints but now I'd like to relaunch it in a big bad way!</p>
<p>In September there's a gathering of indie comics creators in Bethesda, Maryland called SPX (Small Press Expo). It's my goal to travel there and premier an all-new printed Bluenose book! Whoa!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Needs, wants, plans, REWARDS!</h3>
<p>The costs I need to cover are those of printing, travel and production of my book.</p>
<p>Right now, some of my best flight options are in the $500-600 range. I'll be working myself silly to cover extra travel costs but the biggest barrier currently are the tickets and additional travel on the ground.</p>
<p>Next, and most importantly, would be printing and production costs for the books. I'm looking to print between 150-200 for the initial run in black and white. I'll be printing/assembling them myself to save on shipping costs so I'll need funds for the raw materials only: Printer, paper, ink, stapler, staples, love. The more money I'm able to raise, the better the book will look!</p>
<p>I'll also need to cover the time spent making the book. Although most of it will be done in my off-hours, I'll still need to take a little time away from my usual commission work to design, assemble and ship my minis out.</p>
<p><strong><em>MORE IMPORTANTLY??? Incentives!</em></strong></p>
<p>For donating $5 and up, you'll get a handsome digital copy (PDF) of the book!</p>
<p>Pay a little bit more and I'll throw in 2 digital, ready-for-print sized Bluenose illustrations, <em>one of which has never been seen by internet eyes before!</em></p>
<p>Perks for higher donor levels include an actual real-life copy of the book for your hands/eyes and sketches of your wonderful faces done in the Bluenose style!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is my first forray into the world of printed comics and I couldn't be more excited! I'm in love with the work I've created for the book and I can't wait to share it with everyone.</p>
<p>Combined with the opportunity to meet-and-greet those of you who'll be able to attend SPX this year and give you a copy in person, this entire campaign will be a dream come true for me.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>No money? You can still help!</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute any money, DON'T WORRY! I'm in the same boat a lot of the time. In fact, I've been made the honourary captain of that boat.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate any forwarding/sharing you could do across social media - Twitters, Facebooks, tumblrs! MSN your grandma and see what she has to say about it. I humbly thank you so so much for any sharing you do!</p>

To date, Bluenose has 3 chapters and 250+ pages. I had to take a haitus from the comic due to time contraints but now I'd like to relaunch it in a big bad way!
In September there's a gathering of indie comics creators in Bethesda, Maryland called SPX (Small Press Expo). It's my goal to travel there and premier an all-new printed Bluenose book! Whoa!


Needs, wants, plans, REWARDS!
The costs I need to cover are those of printing, travel and production of my book.
Right now, some of my best flight options are in the $500-600 range. I'll be working myself silly to cover extra travel costs but the biggest barrier currently are the tickets and additional travel on the ground.
Next, and most importantly, would be printing and production costs for the books. I'm looking to print between 150-200 for the initial run in black and white. I'll be printing/assembling them myself to save on shipping costs so I'll need funds for the raw materials only: Printer, paper, ink, stapler, staples, love. The more money I'm able to raise, the better the book will look!
I'll also need to cover the time spent making the book. Although most of it will be done in my off-hours, I'll still need to take a little time away from my usual commission work to design, assemble and ship my minis out.
MORE IMPORTANTLY??? Incentives!
For donating $5 and up, you'll get a handsome digital copy (PDF) of the book!
Pay a little bit more and I'll throw in 2 digital, ready-for-print sized Bluenose illustrations, one of which has never been seen by internet eyes before!
Perks for higher donor levels include an actual real-life copy of the book for your hands/eyes and sketches of your wonderful faces done in the Bluenose style!


The Impact
This is my first forray into the world of printed comics and I couldn't be more excited! I'm in love with the work I've created for the book and I can't wait to share it with everyone.
Combined with the opportunity to meet-and-greet those of you who'll be able to attend SPX this year and give you a copy in person, this entire campaign will be a dream come true for me.


No money? You can still help!
If you can't contribute any money, DON'T WORRY! I'm in the same boat a lot of the time. In fact, I've been made the honourary captain of that boat.
I'd appreciate any forwarding/sharing you could do across social media - Twitters, Facebooks, tumblrs! MSN your grandma and see what she has to say about it. I humbly thank you so so much for any sharing you do!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>I went to a roller derby game with a friend in 2006 or 2007 and after the game one of the skaters came up to me to try to recruit me for the team as a skater; <i>it's awesome</i>, she said, <i>and fun</i>. ""No thanks,""  I told her. ""I like my teeth in my head.""</p>
<p><i>Well,</i> she said. <i>You could ref</i>.</p>
<p>Officiating* roller derby is awesome and weird. I've been at this since 2008 or so, and I've amassed a lot of hilarity in the meantime. I've officiated in three countries (getting stinky gear and skates through customs was less tricky than anticipated), run through airports trying to get connecting flights, reffed in a hurricane (twice) and in a horse barn (once, maybe twice?), and navigated crabby teams, ornery officials, structural mayhem (sometimes it's so humid it actually rains INSIDE of the rinks...), and other wacky nonsense.</p>
<p>I drove halfway across the country once to officiate (it's a hilarious story now), was forced to call off a game once at the exact half (that's a hell of a story), coordinated a couple of tournaments, learned how to jam ref (despite still being kind of terrible at it), got streaked once while I was working a game (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE), survived minor penalties (oh Godzilla nooooo), a pizzaquest in STL, and survived (okay, perpetuated) a whoooooole  lot of pranks, ridiculous road trips, and tequila shots. Our outfits might not be as rad as skater outfits, but it's still a pretty sweet hobby.**</p>
<p>Some of you know these stories. But by the end of this book, you'll know all of my favorites. When I started officiating, the average shelf life of a roller derby official was about 2 years. I've been at it for quite a bit longer. There's gotta be some good stories in there...</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Otherwise known as the money stuff...</p>
<p>I'm printing with Lulu.com (again) because of their flexible publication options and because they did a great job with both of my previous books. My goal is to do a signed and numbered first printing of between 150 and 200 copies of <strong>So You're A Ref...?</strong>, to have stock to bring to various shows and distribution networks and also to get the books to my backers. Each book costs about $6 to produce -- about $900 to about $1200 depending on final page counts (around 100 or so digest-size pages is my projection; initial story planning suggests that it'll land somewhere in the 100-120 page range) and total final copies.</p>
<p>$350 of this campaign covers the cost of the lengthy and tedious process of converting the 100+ drawn pages into a digital format. In the interest of finishing in a timely fashion, I'm getting some help from a fellow artist on this one, because I want to support another working artist as part of this project.</p>
<p>The last $400 of this proposal covers the assorted shipping costs of getting books to me and then getting the books to you (postage costs about $3 per copy in the US, and international is $12! Ooof!) and various other expenses (mailers, promotional material, sample copies, fundraising fees, etc.) associated with printing a long form book and crowdsourcing the funding.</p>
<p>My goal is to finish this book no matter what happens with the fundraising. So if I don't hit my minimum goal, there will still be something in your mailbox. I'm using this crowdfunding plan as a way to get the collection done; that accountability is a major part of why I chose the flexible funding option rather than the fixed all-or-nothing funding option.</p>
<p><strong>Perks!</strong></p>
<p>Everyone loves perks? I wanted to do a combination of cool things and essential things -- so the perks are both practical and quirky, and also reflect my artistic interests these days. They're mostly roller derby themed, in keeping with the theme of the book, but your support helps me keep publishing my work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've successfully completed two previous book projects via Indiegogo, so the risk of non-completion is pretty low, in my opinion. The primary challenge for me is making sure to hit my deadlines, but I have a hard deadline -- I'd like to debut this book at the Small Press Expo in Bethesda in September, so my production timeline reflects that. </p>
<p>I'm planning to create the bulk of this work during the time that this campaign runs. By the end of the 30 days I intend to have the majority of the work (if not all of it) fully completed. My goal is to hand the pages off to the rad human who's going to convert them to digital files by mid-to-late June, so that July can be spent scanning, proofing, etc. and the books can go to press by early August, which should ideally leave enough time for books to arrive by SPX in mid-September and ship to backers shortly afterwards.  I'll also post some of the material here as I finish it, so you can stay current on my progress toward those goals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't donate, you can still help. Sharing the link among your social networks to get the word out is incredibly helpful.  I'll update this site with sketches and news as the project moves forward so you can stay in touch and watch how it goes!</p>
</div><p>Thanks, folks.</p><p>Anne</p><p>(aka Anne Persand)</p><p>* I'm going to use the word <i>officiating </i>a lot, because it's more inclusive: as an official I sometimes work as a referee and sometimes I work as a non-skating official, and I see these things as pretty linked.

Well, she said. You could ref.
Officiating* roller derby is awesome and weird. I've been at this since 2008 or so, and I've amassed a lot of hilarity in the meantime.

<p>Ciao, sono Davide La Rosa. Ancora io, sì. Sono tornato.</p>
<p>Per chi si fosse perso la campagna dell'anno scorso. Io sono nato a Como nel 1980, e faccio i fumetti (sono autore, tra le altre cose di ""Suore ninja""; ""Paco Lanciano e il fagiano crononauta""; ""Ugo Foscolo indagatore dell'incubo""; ""La Bibbia 2""; ""Il libretto rosso del trio occhialuto antifascista""; e altri fumetti). Tecnicamente sarei uno sceneggiatore ma, spesso, mi ritrovo a fare storie scritte e disegnate da me. Quindi sono un autore completo… come completo è il disastro dei miei disegni. Già, non so disegnare. Però pare che questi disegni funzionino con le cose che racconto. PARE eh, mica lo so se è vero… ai posteri l’ardua sentenza (dannati posteri, sempre lì pronti a giudicare).<br/>Comunque.<br/>Un giorno mi sono detto: “Davide, perché non illustri, male, tutta la Divina Commedia di Dante Alighieri?”. Ho lanciato una campagna per l'Inferno e andò particolarmente bene. Quindi ora sono qui a proporvi la seconda cantica: il Purgatorio!</p>

<p>I motivi per comprare questo libro (che uno potrebbe pensare essere inutile perché tanto Dorè lo ha fatto benissimo prima di me) sono 3:</p>
<p>1) Dorè era bravo a disegnare, facile illustrare quando si è bravi a disegnare. Provate voi ad essere incapace e illustrare 33 canti (che ora sono 67, visto che ho già fatto i 34 dell'Inferno).</p>
<p>2) Dorè è morto.<br/><br/>3) Il 2021 è l'anno in cui si celebrano i 700 anni dalla morte di Dante.</p>
<p>Il libro, brossurato, sarà di circa 240 pagine in bianco e nero. Dentro ci sarà il testo originale di Dante (che tanto, come detto sopra, è morto da 700 anni e non mi può denunciare) e tutto sarà illustrato da me (che per ora sono vivo quindi magari mi denuncio da solo… decido in settimana). Ci saranno circa 3 o 4 illustrazione a canto, per immortalare i momenti più salienti di un’opera immortale.</p>

<p>The Golden Thread Project is a celebration of folk song and the graphic arts. Collaborating with the English Folk Dance &amp; Song Society we have created an exhibition which celebrates a seminal moment in folk history. 29 artists have created comic strips and illustrations based on this moment and on March 13th 2018 we are exhibiting this work at Cecil Sharp House in London.</p>

Collaborating with the English Folk Dance & Song Society we have created an exhibition which celebrates a seminal moment in folk history. 29 artists have created comic strips and illustrations based on this moment and on March 13th 2018 we are exhibiting this work at Cecil Sharp House in London.

<p>Also you can't read the comic to find out yet, because I need the money to pay for the rest of the pages.  <strong>That's where we need your help!</strong></p>
<p>We are Ran'Deesha Diaz (the writer) and Jacqueline Deglass (artist) and we've loved comics for many years, and we've finally decided to try making our own.</p>
<p>We want to make this comic because we think it would be a fun comic to read, for us and for anyone else.  Comics have a special advantage that no other medium has, because they can take the reader places that would take hundreds of millions of dollars for a movie or TV show to pull off, they can involve a reader visually in a way text can't, and they can go beyond the limits of imagination to do things no one thought of before, especially with characters no one's ever tried to make before.  We want to make comics like that!</p>
<h3>Literally #1, what's it about?</h3>
<p>It's a sort of bizarre satirical comedic action story that focuses on Helen Arambula, an overweight 12 year old Mexican girl who goes to an ordinary junior high school.  She seems like an average nerdy girl in school, but when she gets home, she puts on her cosplay outfit and teleports to another planet where endless swarms of monsters have to be fought back, and she joins a rag tag team of colorful diverse characters in fighting the monsters, while also balancing their normal daytime lives.  Helen's troubles are unique due to her situation, and how she interacts with her fellow mech jockeys leads to a lot of fun and exciting situations in combat.  And there's plenty of combat, with mechs stomping around and big crazy monsters attacking, and Helen is in the middle of all of it.</p>
<p>The pages, as funded so far, will be in black and white, as I'm unable to afford color, HOWEVER if we exceed our funding goal, I will use the extra money to get the comic colored, no problem!  Any money beyond that will be used to fund Literally #2.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we're gonna do with that sweet sweet MONEY</h3>
<p>The entire comic series has been fully scripted, the concept art is wrapped up, and the first couple of pages are already finished.</p>
<p>However, I've had to pay Jacqueline with my own money for the first few pages, and it sucks to admit, but I ran out of money and went into debt trying to make this comic, because I'm so determined to make a real comic book after just thinking about it for years.</p>
<p>The funding goes directly to paying for the remaining pages.  The $500 goal will pay for about 5 pages, which isn't all of them, but as long as I can get some help paying for them, anything is good.</p>
<h3>Stretch goals!</h3>
<p>The first stretch goal is paying for the rest of the comic pages.  I'm so flat broke I can't afford the rest of them myself.</p>
<p>Second stretch goal:  Color!  Again, flat broke, so I can't afford to get the pages colored, but if we get enough money, I can afford to have the comic colored, and I do know people who would be capable of doing this, I just need to be able to pay them.</p>
<p>Third stretch goal:  Print?  A print version of this comic would be pretty fun, but by far the biggest expense, so we'd have to become way more successful than I've ever imagined.</p>

<p><b>Short
Summary </b></p>
<p><span>Ladies of Market Street is an original comic book.  What is it about?  </span></p>
<p><span>Veronica Baldwin, disguised as a man infiltrates a human trafficking ring
headquartered in the dank basement of a normal suburban </span><span><span>house
in New Jersey. She is on a mission to save her stolen sister. She’s on her own
and she knows it: Veronica is a New York City Madam, well acquainted with the
seedy underground of organized crime. The arm of the law is not long enough to
touch the powerful puppeteer pulling the strings behind the slave ring. When
she learns that her sister has been executed by this malefactor she is ready to
fight fire with fire. </span></span></p>
<p>Who are the creators of <i>Ladies of Market Street</i>?</p>
<p><span>Trey, the artist, and Emily, the author, are local artists in Des Moines
Iowa.  After meeting Trey at a local art
show, Emily realized he was the only one who could bring her Ladies alive on
the page.  Working together they want to
bring you the 15 book series of Ladies of Market street.  They just need a little help getting
started.  Emily asked Trey to just use
some coal from her fire pit, but Trey insists on having actual art supplies. So
off they go with their crowd funding campaign.

<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This Indiegogo campaign is for the first issue of Ladies of Market Street.  We need to raise money for art supplies and printing costs!</span></p>
<p>With your help we will be able to produce the first issue in this series, with a projected 14 or more issues to follow.</p>
<p>In order to bring this first book to life, Trey will use traditional comic book making tools of the trade, such as ink and brush work. When the art is completed, he will then scan it, add the dialogue, and touch up any flaws or mistakes in the art. From there, the files containing the comic pages and covers will be sent to the printer. Finally, the completed comic book will be ready to be shipped out to you, our awesome supporters!</p>
<p>We plan on printing 100 copies of the
first book to bring to Comic book conventions and art shows. This will be on top of the issues printed especially for backers who want a physical copy or earn one in our perks! We will also be offering the first issue as a digital download.</p>
<p>Once that first book is made available to our public, we will immediately
begin work on the second book and continue the trend!</p>
<p>To show our appreciation to those who fund us and help us
reach our goal, we have created some amazing perks.  We will be offering 3 unique, high quality art prints, all made from art work drawn and painted by Trey. </p>

Short
Summary 
Ladies of Market Street is an original comic book.  What is it about?  
Veronica Baldwin, disguised as a man infiltrates a human trafficking ring
headquartered in the dank basement of a normal suburban house
in New Jersey. She is on a mission to save her stolen sister. She’s on her own
and she knows it: Veronica is a New York City Madam, well acquainted with the
seedy underground of organized crime. The arm of the law is not long enough to
touch the powerful puppeteer pulling the strings behind the slave ring. When
she learns that her sister has been executed by this malefactor she is ready to
fight fire with fire. 
Who are the creators of Ladies of Market Street?
Trey, the artist, and Emily, the author, are local artists in Des Moines
Iowa.  After meeting Trey at a local art
show, Emily realized he was the only one who could bring her Ladies alive on
the page.  Working together they want to
bring you the 15 book series of Ladies of Market street.  They just need a little help getting
started.  Emily asked Trey to just use
some coal from her fire pit, but Trey insists on having actual art supplies. So
off they go with their crowd funding campaign. 





What We Need & What You Get

This Indiegogo campaign is for the first issue of Ladies of Market Street.  We need to raise money for art supplies and printing costs!
With your help we will be able to produce the first issue in this series, with a projected 14 or more issues to follow.
In order to bring this first book to life, Trey will use traditional comic book making tools of the trade, such as ink and brush work. When the art is completed, he will then scan it, add the dialogue, and touch up any flaws or mistakes in the art. From there, the files containing the comic pages and covers will be sent to the printer. Finally, the completed comic book will be ready to be shipped out to you, our awesome supporters!
We plan on printing 100 copies of the
first book to bring to Comic book conventions and art shows. This will be on top of the issues printed especially for backers who want a physical copy or earn one in our perks! We will also be offering the first issue as a digital download.
Once that first book is made available to our public, we will immediately
begin work on the second book and continue the trend!
To show our appreciation to those who fund us and help us
reach our goal, we have created some amazing perks.  We will be offering 3 unique, high quality art prints, all made from art work drawn and painted by Trey. 



Depending on your pledge level, you can chose from one, two,  or even all three prints. If you pledge high enough, you can even chose to receive one of the original pieces of art the prints are based on. 



For the highest levels, we will also offer a page of the original comic art itself!  Emily will be giving copies of her
novel, Benvolio.  Check out all of
our perks and choose your level of donation and see just how generous the
Ladies are!
The Impact
We are excited to bring an original, unique , and above all entertaining story into the world. We have a passion for story telling, especially sequential art, and we are looking forward to adding our voices to the ever expanding chorus of independent, creator owned comic books. So, get ready for some great story

<p>Some supplemental items such as the enamel pin have already been manufactured, and are just waiting to ship.  The artbook is 100% complete, with a printer lined up- all that is left to do is to fund it! Here are how the funds we raise will be distributed:<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564043682/dqnxephaox7ah37bfcnb.png"" src=""""/><br/>I chose flexible funding to ensure that whether or not we reach our goal, you will receive the items you ordered. If our initial goal is not met, I will simply adjust the print run according to the resources available.<br/> </p>
<h3><u>Challenges                                               </u></h3>
<p>I have been making products such as prints, pins, and comics for conventions for over 10 years, and am well-versed in working with printers and factories. Therefore, I do not foresee any major problems with the manufacturing process. The only hurdle we may have is with the shipping, since as of right now I am taking care of the shipping myself. In the event that it becomes unrealistic for me to pack and ship all the orders alone, however, I will reallocate some of the packaging funds to hire some friends to help me, in order to ensure your perks are delivered within a reasonable time frame.<br/> </p>

Some supplemental items such as the enamel pin have already been manufactured, and are just waiting to ship.  The artbook is 100% complete, with a printer lined up- all that is left to do is to fund it! Here are how the funds we raise will be distributed:I chose flexible funding to ensure that whether or not we reach our goal, you will receive the items you ordered. If our initial goal is not met, I will simply adjust the print run according to the resources available. 
Challenges                                               
I have been making products such as prints, pins, and comics for conventions for over 10 years, and am well-versed in working with printers and factories. Therefore, I do not foresee any major problems with the manufacturing process. The only hurdle we may have is with the shipping, since as of right now I am taking care of the shipping myself. In the event that it becomes unrealistic for me to pack and ship all the orders alone, however, I will reallocate some of the packaging funds to hire some friends to help me, in order to ensure your perks are delivered within a reasonable time frame.

<p></p></div>","Hello and welcome to our campaign!
Nous
vous saluons à notre promotion!Our-Lady-
of-the-Swallows is a full color, 120 page Greek graphic novel by George Tsiamantas,
based on Marguerite Yourcenar's short-story of the same name.It's a fascinating
story about the sanctity of nature, which is life itself with all its contradictions.
A story about love and fear. About transformation and regeneration. Conflict
and reconciliation. The new religion of Christianity and the ancient myths of
Greek mythology.
In the short story by Margueritte
Yourcenar, one of the most prominent figures of French literature, we find
ourselves at the dawn of the Middle Ages. A monk reaches Attica after leaving
Egypt and strives to eliminate the river Nymphs. He persuades the frightened
peasants to aid him. But the lustful deities of nature will find an unexpected
ally...""Simple, elegant and magical. Reminiscent of the best of Joann Sfar.""Mike CareyIt's an ambitious project to
which we've been devoted with passion for almost two years. After
meticulous research, the illustrator and comics creator George Tsiamantas,
in collaboration with the philologist Vangelis Psarianos, depicts the time
and place of the story as accurate as possible. In doing so, the graphic
novel does not only satisfy comic book enthusiasts but its inspiring and
gripping images can be used for educational purposes as well.Thanks to George's beautiful illustrations and the persisting efforts of the
non-profit Greek comics publisher, Comicdom Press, we managed to obtain the
publishing rights in Greek, but mainly the rights for the adaptation of the
story into a comic. Something that is attempted for the first time anywhere in
the world with one of Yourcenar's works.
We
hope that with your valuable support this project will be realized,paving the
way for possible publications in French and English.«Notre-Dame
des Hirondelles» est un roman graphique en grec, en couleur, composé de 120 pages,
illustré par Georges Tsiamantas, illustrateur des bandes dessinées. Ce roman
graphique est la représentation en image du récit,au même titre, de Marguerite
Yourcenar.Il s'agit d'une histoire fascinante qui parle du caractère sacré
de la nature. Ce caractère sacré n'est pas autre chose que la vie elle-même
pleine de toutes ses contradictions. C'est alors une histoire qui présente
l'amour (éros) et la peur, la métamorphose et la renaissance, le conflit et la
réconciliation, la nouvelle religion (apparue à ce temps-là) de christianisme
et les Nymphes archaïques de la légende grecque.Ce récit de Marguerite Yourcenar, ( une des auteures les plus
importantes de la littérature et des lettres françaises) nous dépayse
complètement en nous voyageant au commencement du moyen Âge, au moment où un
moine d' Egypte arrive à Athènes (Attique) et il se combat afin d'éliminer les
fées de la rivière, en persuadant les paysans terrifiés de l'aider. Mais les
divinités sensuelles de la nature trouvent un allié inattendu...
Un projet ambitieux sur lequel on travaille passionnément et
avec une devotion totale depuis 2 ans. L' illustrateur et créateur des BD,
Georges Tsiamantas, en collaboration avec le professeur de lettres Vagelis
Psarianos, ont élaboré la recherche nécessaire pour qu'ils puissent enfin
reconstituer vraisemblablement le paysage et l'époque présenté dans
cette histoire. Tout cela a un but double ; tout d'abord fasciner les
amateurs de BD, mais en plus de pouvoir utiliser ce roman graphique pour des
raisons éducatives via les images charmantes et inspirées de l'artiste.""Simple, élégant et magique. Plein de meilleurs souvenirs de Joann Sfar.""Mike CareyGrâce aux belles images de Georges Tsiamantas, et les efforts
persistants de la maison des éditions (à but non lucratif) Comicdom Presse,
nous avons réussi à aquérir les droits d'édition en langue grecque,
mais plus spécifiquement le virement du récit de Marguerite Yourcenar en BD, un
projet ambitieux qui est tenté pour la première fois en ce qui concerne
l'oeuvre de Yourcenar.
Nous espérons que grâce à votre aide précieuse, cette édition
puisse se réaliser et ouvrir le chemin à d'autres éditions pareilles en langue
française et anglaise.“Απλό, καλαίσθητο και μαγικό. Φέρνει στον νου τα καλύτερα του Joann Sfar.” Mike Carey

<p></p>My name is Rachel Dukes. I’m an illustrator/cartoonist and have been and self-publishing comics for a decade. Recently, I've worked with BOOM! Studios and graduated with my MFA from The Center for Cartoon Studies. Primarily, I post comics on my own website and on Tumblr, but I also try and exhibit at as many comic conventions throughout the year as possible. (As they're the thing that really pays my bills and help me make new fans and friends.)<br/><br/>Last week I was contacted by Josh O'Neill from Locust Moon in Philadelphia inviting me to attend the Locust Moon Comics Festival on October 5th. I have zero dollars in my bank account but this years Locust Moon Fest is host to brilliant creators like Jim Steranko, Dean Haspiel, Kim Deitch, and the Meathaus gang; so it's a hard offer to turn down. It's also a great opportunity for me to go over to the east coast and broaden my audience as a mini-comics creator.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need<br/>
</h3>
<p>$900 will cover the entire trip: printing and packing books to bring to the show, mailing backers their books and perks, Indiegogo and Paypal fees, show costs, food, the works. Let's break down those expenses:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing the table at the show, travel to get there, and a few cheesesteaks once I'm there (so that I don't starve) is going to run me $450.<br/>
</li>
<li>Printing 100 copies of each of my latest minis (<i>Adventure Story</i>, <i>Stay With Me</i>, <i>Frankie Comics</i>, and <i>Coldwater</i>) is going to cost $350.</li>
<li>Indiegogo and Paypal fees are going cost another $100.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>Mini-comics and artwork by yours truly, delivered right to your door! (All backer prices include shipping costs.)<br/><br/>I have four mini-comics and two big anthologies I can offer you as perks. Three of the four minis are completed and just need to be printed. I'm finishing the last one up this week. (The two anthologies are printed and sitting on my stock shelf, just waiting for new homes.) <br/><br/><ul>

My name is Rachel Dukes. I’m an illustrator/cartoonist and have been and self-publishing comics for a decade. Recently, I've worked with BOOM! Studios and graduated with my MFA from The Center for Cartoon Studies. Primarily, I post comics on my own website and on Tumblr, but I also try and exhibit at as many comic conventions throughout the year as possible. (As they're the thing that really pays my bills and help me make new fans and friends.)Last week I was contacted by Josh O'Neill from Locust Moon in Philadelphia inviting me to attend the Locust Moon Comics Festival on October 5th. I have zero dollars in my bank account but this years Locust Moon Fest is host to brilliant creators like Jim Steranko, Dean Haspiel, Kim Deitch, and the Meathaus gang; so it's a hard offer to turn down. It's also a great opportunity for me to go over to the east coast and broaden my audience as a mini-comics creator.


What I Need

$900 will cover the entire trip: printing and packing books to bring to the show, mailing backers their books and perks, Indiegogo and Paypal fees, show costs, food, the works. Let's break down those expenses:

Purchasing the table at the show, travel to get there, and a few cheesesteaks once I'm there (so that I don't starve) is going to run me $450.

Printing 100 copies of each of my latest minis (Adventure Story, Stay With Me, Frankie Comics, and Coldwater) is going to cost $350.
Indiegogo and Paypal fees are going cost another $100.

What You GetMini-comics and artwork by yours truly, delivered right to your door! (All backer prices include shipping costs.)I have four mini-comics and two big anthologies I can offer you as perks. Three of the four minis are completed and just need to be printed. I'm finishing the last one up this week. (The two anthologies are printed and sitting on my stock shelf, just waiting for new homes.) 

Adventure Story: Short, silent comic about a cat and it's teapot. In the style of Ed Emberly. (2.75"" x 4.25"" // 6 pages.)


Stay With Me: Short, silent comic about a cat and a wolf. (3.875"" x 5.5"" // 6 pages.)


Frankie Comics: Collection of gag strips chronically the adventures of Frankie the cat. (5.25"" x 7.75"" // 14 pages.)


Coldwater: A short story about two young punks musing about the future. (5.25"" x 7.75"" // 14 pages.)


Side A: Over 30 short stories in this music-inspired anthology. About the influence that music has on the creative process and the life of the artist, the book includes stories illustrated by comic veterans Liz Greenfield, Corey Marie Parkhill, and Ben Snakepit. (6.625"" × 10.25"" // 136 pages.)


Side B: Created by veteran and ingenue artists alike, Side B contains over 200 pages of lost lovers, rocking out, spirit guides, ghosts, and dinosaurs – it’s like an action adventure comic for the music lover in all of us.Including the creative talents of such comic icons as Jeffrey Brown (Clumsy), Brandon Graham (Multiple Warheads), Ryan Kelly (Local), Jim Mahfood (Clerks), Box Brown, Colleen Frakes, Cristy C. Road, Grant Reynolds, Joe Decie, John Isaacson, Jonathan Baylis, Liz Baillie, Noah Van Sciver, and many more!Whether you’re an audiophile or a comic nerd, this unique and electrifying read will show you how music touches our lives every day as an influential and defining part of every generation, every culture. (6.625"" × 10.25"" // 232 pages.)


Commissioned Artwork: I'm also offering five black and white, 11""x17"" custom commissions at half off for $100/pop. You and your sweetheart, your pets, their sweethearts, gift for a buddy... whatever.



If We Don't Reach $900
Then my heart will be broken.Just kidding! But really: if we don't hit $900 it's not the end of the world. I'll still print and mail people copies of their comics, even if I can't make it to the show myself. Alternate options include:

Getting to the show in person but printing less than 100 copies of each of the mini-comics.

 Renting the tablespace at the show, sending my books along without me, and having friends sell on my behalf. (But: boring for my poor friends, amirite?)
...some third thing.

<p>I’ve decided I’m going to do a strip-format with a color cover. I’m going to do the fattest mini I’ve done yet, at 24 pages. I’ve got most of the strips thumbed out and semi-planned. I’m gonna be marathonning their completion after some work I’m doing right now wraps.</p>
<p>I look forward to giving all of you at <span class=""caps"">TCAF</span> a mini and some <span class=""caps"">HUGE</span> <span class=""caps"">HUGS</span>!!</p>
<p>To everyone who has helped me… <span class=""caps"">THANK</span> <span class=""caps"">YOU</span>. I can’t express my complete gratitude that you could make this possible for me.

<p>I LOVE MINICOMICS! I love going to conventions and giving them away, like a fiscally unsound Johnny Appleseed of comics. This year I moved to San Francisco from Ohio, so now I'm super far away from all my wonderful Midwest and East Coast friends. If you help me get to TCAF, I will come with an armload of minicomics to give away for free!</p>
<p>If you donate enough, I will do something fun and adorable for you!!!</p>

Please.)The answer for Life in the UK Question of the day  2 -  You must treat everyone equally, regardless of sex, race, age, religion, disability, class or sexual orientation - TRUE OR FALSE?Honestly, it is a real question from the test. the answer is ""true"", doh!?

<p>Hello, and thanks for checking out my fundraiser for Issue #2 of <strong>TIME AND AGAIN</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>BACKSTORY:</strong> A little while ago I wrote a comic which featured the adventures of a college girl called Cindi who finds a genie in a gem. It was published on another website for a while, and then I continued the story on my own by funding Issue #1 of TIME AND AGAIN. Now it's time for the next issue!</p>
<p>To recap, after finding the genie Cindi tried to wish herself a chest more impressive than what two girls who were harassing her had, but the genie - as genies are apt to - screwed around with Cindi’s wishes. When all was said and done Cindi’s rivals - Tina and Andrea - ended up in love with her and got wishes of their own. Thanks to some poorly worded sentences Cindi, the girls, and a third woman ended up as genies themselves. Now Tina and Andrea have made their way to a frat party, while Cindi and Genie have arrived at Cindi's apartment. Cindi is no longer a genie, but she's not exactly back to normal yet...</p>
<p>The new issue picks the up the next morning, with each character dealing with the consequences of their respective journeys.</p>
<p>This issue deals mainly with plot developments over wishes, but don't worry - there are still transformations to be found! All the same zany and mature sexiness that made the original comic so great is here.</p>
<p>Because this comic and its bonuses include nudity and adult situations, no donors under 18!</p>
<p>I'll be working with the same artists who did last year's TIME AND AGAIN #1, Andrea + Ale! They drew for me the image above and did a great job stepping in and taking over illustration duties.</p>
<p>I'm planning on at least 20 pages, and am looking to raise $2,100 (fees take a lot out). Something that can only be done thanks to fundraising is that for every extra $110 dollars we make over $2,100 I will work in an extra page. So, we make $2,210 the comic is at least 21 pages. $2,320 and it’s 22, and so on.</p>
<p>This is a flexible funding campaign. If we do not reach $2,100 production of the comic will move forward, but at a slower rate than expected.</p>
<p>Please check out the rest of the material on this page to see what other kind of fun bonuses there are, and please donate! I’d love to keep writing this series for all you fans and I hope we can make this happen!</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Xenos are coming, and humanity's only hope is the world's most accomplished super soldier: Alpha X! This ass-kicking gal doesn't need any help protecting the solar system from the alien scourge--but we DO need YOU to make the battle possible! Your donation not only gets you some great original and independent artwork, but it also provides an opportunity for a group of 12 dedicated artists to bring their creation to Minnesota's largest comic convention audience at Wizard World Minneapolis!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an homage to the golden age of pulp science fiction, the story and style of Alpha X harkens back to outer space adventure comics from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. This was an era when the most talented comic creators worked together in legendary studios to churn out stories and images that would change our cultural landscape while projecting readers into the furthest reaches of the universe and into the deepest limits of human potential. Similarly, the members of the <a href=""facebook.com/twincitiescomiccollective"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Twin Cities Comic Collective</a> (TC3) have set out to work together to bring you an adventure that we hope will captivate your imagination in the same way that the comics of your youth did on lazy Saturday mornings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In creating Alpha X, nothing was done on an individual basis. The story creation and script writing were jointly completed by Lucas Munson and David Jensen, two talented comic authors with a passion for science fiction and stories of outer space. Page layout and design was discussed as a collective and then executed by Jeff Kulisek, an accomplished comic author and illustrator in his own right. Once layouts were completed, professional illustrators Doug Kallberg, Jack Kotz, Scott Rolfs, Jack Montgomery, Brad Perri, Brock Beauchamp, Phil Juliano, and Joe Rheault helped Jeff pencil and ink the pages. When one artist had completed penciling a page, he would pass it off to another artist to complete the inking. This method produced 34 distinctive illustrated styles—one for each page of story content seen throughout this ambitious comic book. After inking was completed, multi-talented artist Cory Fox added a classic color palette to bring the illustrations to life. Finally, Doug finished with color shading and detail throughout the book. As a result of this collaborative effort, every single page marries the talents of a minimum of six artists, creating a unique yet unified artistic style. It is a project unlike anything you've seen before, and it truly highlights the incredible skill that the members of the TC3 bring the the flourishing Twin Cities comic scene. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1323479/files/20150324183928-Alpha_X_Stages.jpg?1427247568"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>This first 40-page full-color issue (part one of three) is bursting with original story ideas and artwork, concept illustrations, and companion materials. Printed in partnership with a family-owned Twin Cities press, every single step of the creative process celebrates local artistry and an independent aesthetic. With this in mind, we hope that our hard work and dedication to ""thinking local"" will make you proud to support our growing group of home-town hopefuls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When thinking of how to reward those who choose to donate to our campaign, we wanted to provide exciting and original perks that are both one-of-a-kind and out-of-the-ordinary. These will all be handled with the care and professionalism that people expect from the TC3. Every piece is unique to this campaign, and we believe all of the items truly celebrate the independent nature of our artistry. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for timing, we know we are right on track with our goal. Currently, we are putting the finishing touches on coloring and detail work for the last half of the story pages. The entirety of the book will be ready in early April, and printing will be completed before the first day of <a href=""http://www.wizardworld.com/home-minneapolis.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wizard World Minneapolis</a>, May 1st. This is definitely not our first rodeo; as a group, we have self-released over 20 different comic projects--a few of which were also supported through crowd-funding endeavors. We are very confident in our ability to meet our deadlines, and we will not disappoint our backers. As soon as we receive our funding after the close of our campaign, we will begin creating and ordering all perk items. It is our goal to have all perks in the mail by May 31st. </p>
<p>
</p><p>One additional note: we recognize that those donating to our fund are paying more than they usually would for some products that are for sale in comic shops or at conventions. Certainly, your donation goes toward covering the costs of producing our perks, but the vast majority of the earnings on this campaign will be used to create a presence at the Wizard World Comic Convention in Minneapolis, May 1st thought the 3rd. We will be paying for a bank of five artist tables ($350 each), banners, advertising, and promotional materials. The cost of these items, the fees spent on hosting this campaign, and the taxes for the “income” we earn from it will be covered if we are able to meet our goal of $2,000. Any additional funding raised above and beyond our goal will be put toward the printing of books and posters to be sold at future conventions and in local comic book shops. With your help, we will be able to avoid using our own funds for these endeavors and potentially create an opportunity to earn a modest profit on the books that we sell. Usually, our hundreds of hours of hard work are primarily rewarded by our love of our craft, the pride of a professionally completed project, and the sense of joy that we see in finding people that are interested in what we have made. Your donation gives us one more facet of success: a few dollars to help pay for our expenses. So, please, consider your donation more than just the purchase price of a physical item. Your donation goes toward so much more. We truly can not thank you enough for helping support our passion for making comic books. (However, we will try. Here goes…)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so very much from the bottom of our little ink-stained hearts. We love and appreciate each and every one of you.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Perk Details</b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Any Amount</b></p><p>We certainly appreciate all donations of any amount and never take generosity for granted.

The Xenos are coming, and humanity's only hope is the world's most accomplished super soldier: Alpha X!

Your donation not only gets you some great original and independent artwork, but it also provides an opportunity for a group of 12 dedicated artists to bring their creation to Minnesota's largest comic convention audience at Wizard World Minneapolis!

As an homage to the golden age of pulp science fiction, the story and style of Alpha X harkens back to outer space adventure comics from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. This was an era when the most talented comic creators worked together in legendary studios to churn out stories and images that would change our cultural landscape while projecting readers into the furthest reaches of the universe and into the deepest limits of human potential. Similarly, the members of the Twin Cities Comic Collective (TC3) have set out to work together to bring you an adventure that we hope will captivate your imagination in the same way that the comics of your youth did on lazy Saturday mornings.

When thinking of how to reward those who choose to donate to our campaign, we wanted to provide exciting and original perks that are both one-of-a-kind and out-of-the-ordinary. These will all be handled with the care and professionalism that people expect from the TC3. Every piece is unique to this campaign, and we believe all of the items truly celebrate the independent nature of our artistry. 

As for timing, we know we are right on track with our goal. Currently, we are putting the finishing touches on coloring and detail work for the last half of the story pages. The entirety of the book will be ready in early April, and printing will be completed before the first day of Wizard World Minneapolis, May 1st. This is definitely not our first rodeo; as a group, we have self-released over 20 different comic projects--a few of which were also supported through crowd-funding endeavors. We are very confident in our ability to meet our deadlines, and we will not disappoint our backers. As soon as we receive our funding after the close of our campaign, we will begin creating and ordering all perk items. It is our goal to have all perks in the mail by May 31st. 

One additional note: we recognize that those donating to our fund are paying more than they usually would for some products that are for sale in comic shops or at conventions. Certainly, your donation goes toward covering the costs of producing our perks, but the vast majority of the earnings on this campaign will be used to create a presence at the Wizard World Comic Convention in Minneapolis, May 1st thought the 3rd. We will be paying for a bank of five artist tables ($350 each), banners, advertising, and promotional materials. The cost of these items, the fees spent on hosting this campaign, and the taxes for the “income” we earn from it will be covered if we are able to meet our goal of $2,000. Any additional funding raised above and beyond our goal will be put toward the printing of books and posters to be sold at future conventions and in local comic book shops. With your help, we will be able to avoid using our own funds for these endeavors and potentially create an opportunity to earn a modest profit on the books that we sell. Usually, our hundreds of hours of hard work are primarily rewarded by our love of our craft, the pride of a professionally completed project, and the sense of joy that we see in finding people that are interested in what we have made. Your donation gives us one more facet of success: a few dollars to help pay for our expenses. So, please, consider your donation more than just the purchase price of a physical item. Your donation goes toward so much more. We truly can not thank you enough for helping support our passion for making comic books. (However, we will try. Here goes…)

Thank you so very much from the bottom of our little ink-stained hearts. We love and appreciate each and every one of you.

Perk DetailsAny AmountWe certainly appreciate all donations of any amount and never take generosity for granted. So, regardless of whether you donate to receive a perk or simply pass along the word to your friends through social media, every little bit helps. $5 DonationAt the $5 level (and any level above and beyond), you'll be one of the very first people to read issue #1 of Alpha X! We'll send you a 44+ page full-color PDF full of story, work-in-progress sketches and illustrations, supplementals, and anything else we find that we think you might enjoy. Based on our timeline, you should receive your PDF before the end of April. $10 DonationAt the $10 level, you'll receive the PDF and a hand-drawn sketch card from one member of the TC3. You'll choose the member, we'll choose an Alpha-X related image to create for you on an Alpha-X branded ""trading card."" Here are a selection of cards from our members that have been commissioned in the past:



$15 DonationAt $15, we will send you the PDF and an official Alpha X poster with artwork by Doug Kallberg. Signed by every member of the TC3, the poster features the cover art of issue #1. 




$20 Donation
$20 brings you the main event: issue #1 of Alpha X! This bad mama features 40 full-color pages, the complete first story arc, sketches, concept art, behind-the-scenes content, and more. Your issue will be signed by every member of the TC3 and will include a hand-drawn sketch on the inside cover. These will truly be one-of-a-kind! (And you'll get a PDF for early viewing while we wait for printing.)




$30 Donation
For the first 10 donors at the $30 level, we have a comic and poster bundle package. Everything that's included in the $15 and $20 level will be yours at a nice little discount. Thanks for being an early supporter! 




$40 Donation
So you want to show off our awesome Alpha X artwork everywhere you go? At $40, your donation gets you the deluxe PDF and an Alpha X t-shirt featuring the full-color cover image by Doug Kallberg. A 100% black cotton tee will be ordered in your requested size.




$50 Donation
Interested in putting some original artwork up on your wall? A $50 donation will get you the deluxe PDF and an 11""x17"" original sketch from any requested member of the TC3. You'll name the subject, they'll do the artwork. This could be a detailed black-and-white inked image or a full-color pen-and-marker sketch. Everything is open to discussion. In fact, the concept for Alpha X came out of an original piece of commissioned art by Doug Kallberg (pictured below). 




$125 - $200 Donation
If you're as taken with the art in this book as we are, you might like to grab yourself an original page or two from issue #1 of Alpha X. Each page features the original inks, so you'll get to see everything before the digital removal of pencils and/or blue lines. If you love to see an artist's process, these are the items for you. Each page is signed by the artists responsible for pencils and inks and is embossed with the official TC3 seal of authenticity. They are all absolutely beautiful and obviously one-of-a-kind. Plus, you'll get the deluxe PDF and a physical copy of issue #1 as previously listed.

Page #12 features pencil work by Scott Rolfs and inks by Doug Kallberg.

Following the show, your original page(s) will be mailed to you in highly protective packaging with insurance and delivery confirmation. As a donor to this level of the campaign, you will be listed as a guest of honor at the show's opening reception. 


$250 Donation
Looking to be a big part of the future of Alpha X? Three lucky donors of $250 will be given the chance to be immortalized by the TC3 as a character in issue #2 of Alpha X! You'll receive an original inked page featuring your character signed by all artists responsible for the page's content. It will also be embossed with the official TC3 seal of authenticity. Plus, you'll get the deluxe PDF and a physical copy of issue #1 as previously listed.



$500 Donation


Finally, we've made it to the big one: the $500 ""Honorary TC3 Member"" Wizard World 2015 Alpha X release-party-guest-of-honor! Join us for all three days of the convention: we'll pay for your admission and your lunch each day, we'll have you hang with us behind the TC3 bank of tables (if you want--honorary members are allowed to celebrate with other people at the con, too--we get it--it's cool), we'll give you everything in the $5 through $50 dollar reward tiers, you'll get to be a character in issue #2 and keep your character's inked page, you'll get as many high-fives as we can muster, and if you're a betting person, I'd suggest putting money on getting a whole lot of other great stuff too! This weekend is going to be an absolute blast, and we hope you'll join us in the celebration! (Sorry--we cannot pay for your transportation to the show or weekend lodging.)








ONE LAST THING!


In the spirit of “stretch goals,” if we are able to raise $3,000 or more during this campaign, we will upgrade all of the printed books being delivered to our backers at no additional charge! Only available from this IndieGoGo campaign, your issue of Alpha X will feature a high-quality card stock cover (perfect for a more detailed original sketch) and will be numbered to commemorate the truly limited nature of this run of comics. 

Let's Wrap This Up


You did it! You read the whole thing! Since you're this invested, you might as well throw a couple bucks our way... I mean, it IS a cool project, right? 
Right. 
Again, thank you so much for your support and donations. This is truly going to be something special. And please be sure to spread the word about Alpha X--we know everyone who gets their hands on these exclusives will absolutely love them!",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Three Great Loves is more than a webcomic. In addition to the digital collage illustrations that tell the story online, I am also creating mixed-media collages that further explore the inner lives of the characters and reflect on the very special time and place that was New York City at the turn of the century. These mixed-media collages and print reproductions will be sold in the Three Great Loves Gift Shop as a way of monetizing the site. Your donations will help me pay for art supplies, printing and framing. Your donations will also help me market and promote the site (with flyers, posters, stickers, etc), pay the technical costs associated with maintaining a website, and pay my wonderful, beautiful, awesome models.</p>

</div></div>","My name is Susan Caldwell and I'm working on a graphic novel project titled ""The Three Great Loves of Sean Bravo."" It's a story about three very different women in love with the same man. I'll be releasing it in serialized chapters starting January 1 at www.threegreatloves.com.The story is set in New York City in the year 2000, before the Twin Towers fell; before the market crashed; before gentrification came to Crown Heights, Bed-Stuy and Bushwick... 


(background photo: Creative Commons image courtesy of Alan)
SEAN BRAVO is a deejay at a small but popular club in Manhattan nicknamed 730. He's essentially a cross between a ladies man and a serial monogamist, which gets him in trouble...





(background photo: Creative Commons image courtesy of Danny Howard)
There's MARLENA, the fashion school dropout turned club promoter, who hired him to work at 730 when he was a nobody. She loves him to death, but her jealous streak gets the best of her.

ALICIA is the object of Marlena's jealousy. She and Sean grew up together on the same block in Bushwick. She's always carried a torch for him but she knows she's not his type. A straight-A student, she's committed to her dream of becoming a doctor even though she has a young son to raise.

KYLA appears out of nowhere and instantly steals Sean's heart. Fresh out of college, optimistic, ambitious, and eager for love, she moves from Alabama to New York to be with Sean and reinvent herself in the big city.

<h3>About Iron Skies</h3>
<p>Hi! I am Kristopher Rue, and I am a storyteller. I've spent my life crafting stories, and I have been published in the literary journal Pilcrow and Dagger. In 2009, I started writing the Iron Skies Chronicles for friends and family. I started to put pieces together and build a world, and quickly fell in love with the setting and characters. The chronicles were changed and adapted over the years as I distilled them for more impact.</p>
<p>One thing has never changed - I have always imagined Iron Skies as a visual medium. Thanks to my amazing team, I am able to realize that vision and bring you the epic I've been wanting to tell for a decade.</p>
<p>Author - Kristopher Rue</p>
<p>Artist - Renan Shody and Victor Cappola</p>
<p>Color Artist - Dijjo Lima</p>
<p>Letterer - Eric Weathers</p>
<p>Cover Artist - Caanan White</p>
<p>Airship Design - Mariana Sampaio</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have an awesome team that is putting out top quality work, but to keep that up I need your help! I have been able to personally fund a portion of the project, but Iron Skies is a huge endeavor, and the only way I can get the first issue made and in your hands is if we can hit our goal. Without you, the story ends here.</p>
<p>Supporting the project will net you one of the perks, and make you an historic part of this saga!</p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p><strong>15K - Poster 2 unlocked</strong></p>
<p><strong>25K - Issue 2 unlocked</strong></p>
<p><b>35K - Patch of the Iron Skies logo included with any of the signed copy tiers or higher</b></p>
<p><b>40K - Poster 3 unlocked</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlocking issue 2 will net an approximately 80 page comic and can be told in 6 parts. If the page count sticks to right at 80, I can keep the floppy format. If it goes higher, it may need to come in graphic novel format (squarebound). The additional posters are only available with tiers containing the ""Premium Poster Pack.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This will be my first self published work, so it is possible that there will be obstacles along the way. The artwork does take some time - so there will be a delay if the stretch goals are met - however, I am confident that it will also give you the most ""bang for your buck,"" and I will be keeping all backers updated as pages are done.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the means to contribute, but still want to snag a signed copy there is another option! If you can influence 3 friends to help fund the project (will need to be verified by email addresses) I will ship you a free signed copy!</p>
<p>(The Fine Print: Each free issue applies to unique funders only.)</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>As an director and animation consultant, I was asked by this person to do a great many things for the benefit of his business, which, in his claim, he flips and says he was helping me. My counterclaim states those differences in argument and fact.</p>
<p>As a professor, I stayed involved in this project for the benefit of placing my students in industry jobs.

<p>As an animation studio, I brought more than US$10,000 of equipment and books and furniture into his office, all of which this person still has possession of. Fair? Equitable? Not my right to use my own equipment?</p>
<p>As a creator this person was trying to get a hold of my comic strip “The Norm” and other film script treatments and intellectual property, to possibly try to “help me sell them”. When I declined, the trouble began.</p>

<p>Of course that’s my opinion and one can agree or disagree at will, I don’t seek to convince people of my side of all this but only raise money so that I can prove this in a court of law, which, as we all know, is prohibitively expensive but, ultimately, the proper way to handle this.</p>

<h2>A message from Peter Simeti on Alterna's facebook page....</h2>
<p>July 24, 2012... 11:50am</p>
<p>""in case people think that Alterna is some massive company trying to beg for money here... it's not. it's one person. this guy right here - Peter Simeti - me.  putting everything on the line all the time for everyone's books.  i search through submissions and evaluate them, by myself. i set up the website and facebook pages and maintain them, by myself.  anything that's done with Alterna, is done by me.  I'm not trying to cast a pity party here, but i think there might be some confusion with our fundraiser.<br/><br/>i'm personally in about $30K in debt from Alterna's early start-up years (mostly years one and two) because honestly, we had a few books and creators that completely flaked out on us, leaving me with thousands of books and thousands of debt.  the past few years have been much better than those early ones, but not good enough to erase the years past.<br/><br/>sites like kickstarter and indiegogo didn't really exist back then (and if they did, i didn't know anyone that was using them and i wasn't aware of them) so all my financing involved my own savings, credit cards, and the like.  we couldn't get a bank loan because the company wasn't making enough money - apparently you have to be rich to get a loan and paying your bills on time just isn't enough.  <br/><br/>so now here we are years later. i know we had a fundraiser last year to save Alterna from bankruptcy and while we managed to raise around $1,500 - it only helped us to kick around for another year.  We needed at least $5,000 last year to really do some big time permanent damage.   It's such a small amount in terms of it (if all our friends donated $1 we'd have hit the goal already) but it's tremendous on its impact to Alterna, the creators of books that are published here, and honestly - to myself.  <br/><br/>I know this is long-winded and might come across as desperate - but that's what i am right now ... desperate.  i haven't even taken a check or payment from Alterna in 3 years because the money just isn't there.  And that includes surrendering the royalties to my own books too.<br/><br/>so if you have a few dollars to spare and you care about the books we have here - or even if you just want to support a completely creator-owned company and get something awesome in return - please donate.  thanks.""</p>

<h2>Some background on Alterna Comics...</h2>
Peter Simeti created Alterna Comics in 2006 to provide an alternative for comic creators that had been rejected by other companies.  In a way, it was a last resort kind of publishing company.  Today, their mindset is still the same but they've managed to become a first choice for many creators, instead of the ""only"" choice.<br/> <br/>As the sole operator and financer of Alterna, Peter's put everything he has into the company.  When the credit card bubble burst a few years back, Alterna's growth and means of funding completely stopped.  They weren't able to acquire new capital or get a loan from the bank and essentially should be dead in the water right now.</div>

Since they are not looking to raise funds to print these books, this fundraiser kind of acts like a time machine.  The money raised will go towards paying down the debt that was originally built when paying for the creation of these books.  So it's still a funding campaign of sorts, they're just a few years late.<br/><br/>When these books originally went to print, fundraising sites like kickstarter and indie gogo weren't super popular so Peter ended up putting print runs on credit cards.  He's still in a bit of debt because of this, but it's getting better every year.  Interest fees though, are what's really killing the growth of Alterna, as they lose about $6,000 a year towards paying interest associated with that initial debt.<br/><br/>But because of the terrific community aspect of Alterna - their creators banded together and have managed to soldier on.   They're not doing fantastic - but they're also not out of business.  <br/><br/>They're calling upon the generosity of this community once again by holding a ""reverse fundraiser"" to try and bite down on the credit card debt that those past print runs accumulated. <br/><br/>Hopefully with your help, they will still be around for years to come.<br/><p> </p>

</div></div>","A message from Peter Simeti on Alterna's facebook page....
July 24, 2012... 11:50am
""in case people think that Alterna is some massive company trying to beg for money here... it's not. it's one person. this guy right here - Peter Simeti - me.  putting everything on the line all the time for everyone's books.  i search through submissions and evaluate them, by myself. i set up the website and facebook pages and maintain them, by myself.  anything that's done with Alterna, is done by me.  I'm not trying to cast a pity party here, but i think there might be some confusion with our fundraiser.i'm personally in about $30K in debt from Alterna's early start-up years (mostly years one and two) because honestly, we had a few books and creators that completely flaked out on us, leaving me with thousands of books and thousands of debt.  the past few years have been much better than those early ones, but not good enough to erase the years past.sites like kickstarter and indiegogo didn't really exist back then (and if they did, i didn't know anyone that was using them and i wasn't aware of them) so all my financing involved my own savings, credit cards, and the like.  we couldn't get a bank loan because the company wasn't making enough money - apparently you have to be rich to get a loan and paying your bills on time just isn't enough.  so now here we are years later. i know we had a fundraiser last year to save Alterna from bankruptcy and while we managed to raise around $1,500 - it only helped us to kick around for another year.  We needed at least $5,000 last year to really do some big time permanent damage.   It's such a small amount in terms of it (if all our friends donated $1 we'd have hit the goal already) but it's tremendous on its impact to Alterna, the creators of books that are published here, and honestly - to myself.  I know this is long-winded and might come across as desperate - but that's what i am right now ... desperate.  i haven't even taken a check or payment from Alterna in 3 years because the money just isn't there.  And that includes surrendering the royalties to my own books too.so if you have a few dollars to spare and you care about the books we have here - or even if you just want to support a completely creator-owned company and get something awesome in return - please donate.  thanks.""
-Peter
 

  

Some background on Alterna Comics...
Peter Simeti created Alterna Comics in 2006 to provide an alternative for comic creators that had been rejected by other companies.  In a way, it was a last resort kind of publishing company.  Today, their mindset is still the same but they've managed to become a first choice for many creators, instead of the ""only"" choice. As the sole operator and financer of Alterna, Peter's put everything he has into the company.  When the credit card bubble burst a few years back, Alterna's growth and means of funding completely stopped.  They weren't able to acquire new capital or get a loan from the bank and essentially should be dead in the water right now.

 
 
  
What's a ""Reverse Fundraiser"" you ask?
Since they are not looking to raise funds to print these books, this fundraiser kind of acts like a time machine.  The money raised will go towards paying down the debt that was originally built when paying for the creation of these books.  So it's still a funding campaign of sorts, they're just a few years late.When these books originally went to print, fundraising sites like kickstarter and indie gogo weren't super popular so Peter ended up putting print runs on credit cards.  He's still in a bit of debt because of this, but it's getting better every year.  Interest fees though, are what's really killing the growth of Alterna, as they lose about $6,000 a year towards paying interest associated with that initial debt.But because of the terrific community aspect of Alterna - their creators banded together and have managed to soldier on.   They're not doing fantastic - but they're also not out of business.  They're calling upon the generosity of this community once again by holding a ""reverse fundraiser"" to try and bite down on the credit card debt that those past print runs accumulated. Hopefully with your help, they will still be around for years to come.

We are made up or two writers, two artists, and one editor and come from all walks of life, but we each share a passion for manga and graphic novels. One thing leads to another and we all inevitably got to thinking, “How cool would it be to write a manga?” We want to unveil for you all our project, “My Kingdom,” a fantasy-action one-shot to be released at Anime Boston this coming May, 2013.</p>
<p>The 46-page manga will follow the story of Kyo Mora, an American-Japanese NEET, who wants real life to be more like the exciting world in his favorite MMORPG and whose wish is abruptly granted, trusting him into a world of wizards, warriors, and wide-open plains full of dangerous beasts. The tale will follow his discovery of the strange new world, Asukni, as well as his meeting with a duo of hunters that he befriends and travels with as he tries to find a place he can call home in this strange world.</p>

<h3>THE DUNGEON PARTY – A FIVE-MAN</h3>
<p>Our group is made up of two artists, two writers, and one editor. Our artist duo consists of [Sam and Roy info]. Writing “My Kingdom” is a job that belongs to Patrick Grogan and me, Furanku Moore. I am a CGD (Concept Game Designer) who has designed many game worlds for Fuism Studios. Patrick, on the other hand, is our young, hopeful writer, looking to get into the industry of writing graphic novels. Much like the dreamer Kyo, Patrick dreams of getting more involved in the graphic novel industry as a writer. Last, but certainly not least, is Brandi Mullen, our editor who keeps us in line and who motivates (and intimidates) us to do better and better! By helping us publish and print “My Kingdom,” you are helping hopefuls enter the industry with a bang, bring an amazing story to the public, and help our Sam have a honey moon his wife can be proud of.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>OUR GOAL, A FINAL BOSS</h3>
<p>To be fully funded, we will need $5,000. This includes the costs for printing 100 finished copies of the manga to be sold at Anime Boston, and to help pay the crew of five people working on the project. Any money we receive that goes surpasses our initial goal will be used to fund future projects by [Project Manga] or to cover expenses that might pop up. While we are very sure the later will not occur, more money means that we will be able to pursue more projects in the future and assure that this will not be the last you see or hear from [Project Manga]. In the end if we get a good following we would love to create a series of our manga for everyone.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>DPS CHECK – CAN WE MAKE IT?</h3>
<p>We are very confident in our ability to build a powerful and enthusiastic community around “My Kingdom”, but what if we can’t reach our goal? Because we are over shooting printing costs with this goal in order to pay [Project Manga] in advance, we might be able to tackle this if we can get enough funding. But we would be cutting it very, very close, something we do not want to do because of how important this project is too us, and because of how dedicated we are to making sure both our supporters at IndieGOGO and potential fans at Anime Boston can enjoy “My Kingdom.” We do not want to deprive anyone of a good book, and I think everyone can appreciate a group of creators who want to share a story they loved working on.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>CALLED TO BATTLE – WHAT YOU CAN DO</h3>
<p>We understand if you love our product, but are tight on cash. If you feel that you want to do more to help out, we welcome all the help you can give us! Spread the word! While Kyo thinks the real world and its people are disappointing, we beg to differ because we know how powerful social networking is. Get the word out and tell people you think might be interested! Tweet our project or share our artist’s web-pages to help give them a well-deserved following for all their hard work. Every dollar, every share, every tweet, text, click, and name drop of “My Kingdom” will bring us one step closer to helping us share our project with you.</p>
<p>We hope to see you all real soon. And, if any backers plan to come to Anime Boston, we’ll tell you where you can find us so we can hang for a bit and talk about the book. We’d love to meet you! Any friend of Kyo’s is a friend of ours, after all! If you are at Anime Boston this year we would love meet you as well! We all are eager and hopeful this project will end up begin funded.</p>

<p>Who am I and What's the project?</p>
<p>About me: My name is Joe Kisch and I'm the creator of an exciting project I really want you all to get on board with me on. The project is Drago Bentley: Space Detective and is a sci-fi tech noir story set in the 22nd century.  It is envisaged as a graphic novel of 8 chapters.</p>
<p>As an amateur screenwriter, I have won awards for short screenplays (in partnership with Bruce Davie and Chris Reavell) and have placed highly in international screenplay competitions for several of my feature films over the last six years (including Barrio Chino, Swimming Against the Currents, and Devil's Machine). Do a search and you'll see this is true.  I hope this proves to you that I have a successful track record of writing stories and characters that are solid, resonating and appealing.<br/><br/>Apart from writing screenplays, I've also produced and/or directed short films and was Assistant Director on six more.  I mention this in the hope this goes some way to show that I am really passionate about film, story and screenwriting.</p>
<p>The campaign</p>
<p>Up until now, I have financed the completion of five issues of the eight issue graphic novel Drago Bentley: Space Detective - a story based on a script written in 2006. But the funds have run out and I really need your financial  support to complete this great story. </p>
<p>What I need</p>
<p>I need $9,000 to complete the series.  Thus far, each chapter has cost around $3,000 to produce.  That covers drawing, inking, colouring, texting, printing, and promotional products for comic expos (like T shirts, postcards and posters).</p>
<p>I've structured this campaign so that everyone gets something of value for their contribution/donation to completing stage 1 of the strategy - to get the graphic novel completed.</p>
<p>Why it's important to me</p>
<p>I'm soooo close to the finish line that it would be a sin not to finish this story, especially when there are fans out there that hang on every issue.  I can't, won't, let them down.  You have to help me finish it.  But it does cost money to produce.  Give me the money to finish it and I promise you a producer will be so impressed with the graphic novel that he/she will option it and make it into a live action film.  I just know it in my DNA.</p>
<p>What you'll help me achieve</p>
<p>There are three stages I want to complete for this project: completion of the graphic novel (about 250 pages); completion of motion comics of all 8 chapters (2 are done already); and to sell the concept to a producer to turn the story into a live action feature film.</p>
<p>The story is written and my passionate artistic crew (of Dave Acosta, Teddy Pavon, Mark Martin) are ready to help me complete this story.</p>
<p>Your contributions will make this project succeed and, not only that, if you contribute, I make this pledge: I will make each and every contributor part of the Drago Bentley: Space Detective experience - eg by giving you a credit on the graphic novel.</p>
What You Get</div>
<div>
<p>I've designed the perks so that you get good value for your donation.  Donate $25 and get a motion comic; $50 gets you an autographed graphic novel; $100 gets you the above plus you get to be an extra in the comic; $250 gets you all the above plus a credit in the comic; $500 gets you the above pluse you'll be a real voice over character in the story; and $1000 gets you the works. </p>
<p>A note: although the Perks section below says I will deliver the perks by 31 December 2012, that doesn't mean you won't get perks like downloads, T-shirts, posters and signed issues ahead of that date.  So don't be put off by the delivery date specified below.</p>
Other Ways You Can Help</div>
<div>
<p>I know there are some people who just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help.  Here's what you can do:</p>
<p>Join my website - <a href=""http://dragobentleycomic.canberrafilms.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://dragobentleycomic.canberrafilms.com</a> - it's FREE;</p>
<p>Buy online when you can afford it; and</p>
<p>Get the word out by adding a blurb that talks up the project - make some noise about the campaign.</p>
<p>Look, I make this pledge to you that you won't be sorry you participated in this campaign.  Make a contribution and set the Drago Bentley train a-rolling on to its destination of becoming a live action film.  You'll be able to brag to your friends that you were there at the inception of the project and you will have your names immortalised in the comic.</p>
<p>Thanks a million.</p>

If you did not know, this is causing some turmoil in the comic book industry, as many retailers are shutting down during this pandemic, so many of the orders of the books we print are being canceled or order-adjusted at much lower levels of sales. This campaign is one of those financial instruments that will help us directly in these current times. Now if you are undergoing economic hardship, we completely understand, but maybe give us a shout-out on social media to help promote this campaign. We appreciate any support that you can give. </strong></p><p>If you're not familiar with us, my name is Joeming Dunn, and I run Antarctic Press, a small, independent comic company started in 1984. I have personally collected comics of almost every type and genre since 1974, and I can say that during the past 30 years, we have published some of the greatest and best independent comics out there. Our publishing history includes titles like Gold Digger and Ninja High School. The comic industry has changed over the years, so we have started this Kickstarter program to help introduce new projects from our talented group of creators. You may have seen some of our other successful and fulfilled campaigns.</p><p>Over the years, we have published a number of series. Prominent among these is Fred Perry's ingenious title, Gold Digger, which Fred describes as a mixture of Indiana Jones and Final Fantasy. The idea for Gold Digger was first conceived during Fred's tour of duty in the first Gulf War, and it debuted in Antarctic Press's anthology comic, Mangazine, in 1991. A four-issue miniseries followed in 1992, and a regular monthly black-and-white series followed starting in 1993. The current color series began in 1999 and has continued since then. It is the second-longest-running solo-created title in the industry, and the only second-longest-running female-lead comic series after Wonder Woman. In 2013, Fred was honored at Comic Con International in San Diego, where he received an Inkpot Award for his work on Gold Digger.</p><p>One of our most frequently received fan requests over the years is, ""When can I see the original black-and-white series of Gold Digger in color?""</p><p>Getting a book colored is not an easy proposition due to the cost and time involved, and both of those commodities are scarce in the independent publishing world. But with Kickstarter, it is now possible to achieve that goal. We experimented with a previous Kickstarter (Gold Brick 7), and due to its success, we were able to color the first two issues of the black-and-white series. So back in June of 2016, we ran the first part of this campaign, and we were able to COLORIZE 5 ISSUES. With such encouraging response, we made successive colorizing campaigns.  Out of the 50 black-and-white issues, a total of 18 have been colorized thus far. Here is a small sample of what's been done.

If you did not know, this is causing some turmoil in the comic book industry, as many retailers are shutting down during this pandemic, so many of the orders of the books we print are being canceled or order-adjusted at much lower levels of sales. This campaign is one of those financial instruments that will help us directly in these current times. Now if you are undergoing economic hardship, we completely understand, but maybe give us a shout-out on social media to help promote this campaign. We appreciate any support that you can give. If you're not familiar with us, my name is Joeming Dunn, and I run Antarctic Press, a small, independent comic company started in 1984. I have personally collected comics of almost every type and genre since 1974, and I can say that during the past 30 years, we have published some of the greatest and best independent comics out there. Our publishing history includes titles like Gold Digger and Ninja High School. The comic industry has changed over the years, so we have started this Kickstarter program to help introduce new projects from our talented group of creators. You may have seen some of our other successful and fulfilled campaigns.Over the years, we have published a number of series. Prominent among these is Fred Perry's ingenious title, Gold Digger, which Fred describes as a mixture of Indiana Jones and Final Fantasy. The idea for Gold Digger was first conceived during Fred's tour of duty in the first Gulf War, and it debuted in Antarctic Press's anthology comic, Mangazine, in 1991. A four-issue miniseries followed in 1992, and a regular monthly black-and-white series followed starting in 1993. The current color series began in 1999 and has continued since then. It is the second-longest-running solo-created title in the industry, and the only second-longest-running female-lead comic series after Wonder Woman. In 2013, Fred was honored at Comic Con International in San Diego, where he received an Inkpot Award for his work on Gold Digger.One of our most frequently received fan requests over the years is, ""When can I see the original black-and-white series of Gold Digger in color?""Getting a book colored is not an easy proposition due to the cost and time involved, and both of those commodities are scarce in the independent publishing world. But with Kickstarter, it is now possible to achieve that goal. We experimented with a previous Kickstarter (Gold Brick 7), and due to its success, we were able to color the first two issues of the black-and-white series. So back in June of 2016, we ran the first part of this campaign, and we were able to COLORIZE 5 ISSUES. With such encouraging response, we made successive colorizing campaigns.  Out of the 50 black-and-white issues, a total of 18 have been colorized thus far. Here is a small sample of what's been done. Below are original and colored pages from Gold Digger #6, colorized thanks to one of our previous Kickstarters.       What we would like to do is to continue this process with issue #19 of the series, since the first 18 issues are already funded and complete.Here is a PDF link for Gold Digger #19...http://antarcticpresslibrary.com/gdbw/gdbw19.pdfThe money collected will go to paying the colorist to perform the task of coloring. And for each $1200 we collect beyond the first, we will color the next issue.

Commemorating the beginning of Hoxwinder Hall, I'd like to create a high-quality, limited edition, printed collection for fans of my comic strip.

In addition to the first 30-days of Hoxwinder Hall strips, this volume will also include a plethora of development sketches, discussion of my creative process, an interview, reflections on the Washington Post contest that started it all and the Rick Kirkman mentorship that was awarded to me in the Cartoonist Studio contest.


The book will be over 100 pages, printed on high quality paper stock in a hard cover binding. When finished, a small number of people will be the proud owners of the very first Hoxwinder Hall treasury. Each book will be signed and shipped to your door.

Funds will go toward the hefty costs associated with the design, creation, and production of this high quality collectible book.
Thank you for your help and support!               My Very Best Regards,Daniel Boris

Negra. One Boatman, Two Ships”</b>, is a graphic novel with a touch of
burlesque, slightly different from what you may expect. It is a
pirate story where you won't see any pirates and a samurai story
where you hardly see a samurai or two for most of it, but where you
may meet merchants and smugglers with their worries and fears,
priests with their secrets, soldiers, slaves, sailors and the works
of the Devil, a Portuguese captain and his pilot set on defying the
shadow of a corsair ship against the will of the passengers, or you
may cross briefly the path of an English samurai or an Italian spy.
You will surely meet the Boatman, the Japanese narrator, and his
hallucinated memories of his samurai years, mainly of a three-day
assault on a similar Black Ship (Nau Negra) he had completely forgotten, and
Reimau, a former African slave and hit-man at the service of the
pilot, both with dark stories to tell.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/814214/files/20140826143415-Ua12.jpg?1409088855"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>My
name is Fernando Relvas, I am a Portuguese author of graphic
novels and I am the author of the story about Nau Negra, which means Black Ship, in this case the last of its kind, that made the trip Macau - Nagasaki, in the beginning of the 17th century. </b></p><p>I carry this project on my luggage for some 25 years, when I
got a book about the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kan%C5%8D_Naizen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Japanese Namban screens</a> in the Museu Nacional de
Arte Antiga in Lisboa and I told myself I should make a story
inspired on them someday. But I needed funding to settle and do it, so I kept
doing other things, doing sketches and polishing the idea. Finally, by the end of last year, I could start financing the project with the sale of some of my original artwork, upgrade to a more recent computer, get used to a new software, and depart for the definitive version of the story.</p>
<p>But
that was last year, the trip is half its way, and now we are running
out of wind in our sails, and there's nothing captains dread more
than looking at a immense flat sea all around, the sails hanging limp
as the sailors go drained of all energy.

members usually did, you may dislike the company of the passengers, their haughty manners and their habit of addressing
each other by Your Grace, Your Lordship or Your Excellency, mainly
when they are not entitled to it. You may call them that, if you
wish, just pay attention not to call Excellency someone that you are
not sure it is a Duke in the presence of a close relative of a real
Duke. This one may threaten to cut one of your ears.</p>
<p>Don't
worry, even sailors could be almost as powerful as the lords on
board, at times, because in the hands of the sailors lay the fate of
the ship. And sailors would use that power whenever they could. But
beware of the soldiery, gentry seeking fortune, and the private
swordsmen, they cause trouble for nothing.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813873/files/20140826115827-Ua1.jpg?1409079507"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>You may choose your place on board.</b> On a big Nau (also written Nao) there is a good amount of soldiers and

a surgeon, the purser, the contramestre (sort of boatswain), the
mestre (the shipmaster), the sota-piloto (2<sup>nd</sup> pilot,
possibly even a 3<sup>rd</sup> pilot), the main pilot and the captain, amid other
staff like servants, clerks and officers of justice. In many cases
the main pilot acted as the actual commander of the ship, captaincy
being frequently attributed by favor or, as is the case of the Black
Ships of the trade Macau-Nagasaki, leased.

Adams, known as the English pilot who became a samurai. This and much

</p><p>By the end of the year
1608 the crew of two Japanese Shuinsen or Vermillion Seal Ships, at
dock in the port of Macau, got involved in a fight with the
Portuguese. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most probably, not
even then, one could know for sure who started the fight, but the
Captain-general of Macau and owner of the annual trip to Japan –
made by the large Nau known as Kurofune or Black Ship – surrounded
and punished severely the Japanese crews.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following year,
the Daimyo owner of the Vermillion Seal Ships complained to the
Shogun and demanded that the Black Ship be seized on arrival at
Nagasaki. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Captain-general
refused to be judged by the Shogun and fortified himself on his ship.
On the first days of 1610 a samurai force of the Daimyo gave the
assault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without wind and
having touched ground, the ship became a fortress under siege. After
three days and three nights of fierce fight, the explosion of the
gunpowder magazine finally sank her with all her valuable cargo,
killing most of the crew and some of the attacking party.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">In less than ten years
after those events the last of the black ships would make the trip
between Nagasaki and Macau. This was not a dramatic trip like the one
that rocked the port of Nagasaki almost ten years before, but an
agonizing one. During the entire month of January and part of
February of 1618, the big Nau, full of rich goods, sailed on view of
the land of the Daimyo of Omura, under the threat of an invisible
Dutch corsair.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
destiny of these two large and obsolete ships is not
only linked by the commerce of silk and silver between Macau and
Nagasaki, by the similarities and differences among several cultures
present on board and by the shadow of corsairs and typhoons, but also
by the scars in the body and in the memory of the Boatman.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>The
First Chapter</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The
following pages are in Portuguese. Here is a description of the
action in English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1
– The Boatman</p>
<p>
</p><p>“I
saw them coming from a leisure trip to the islands.” The narrator
describes what he saw. His conclusion: “Worms!” But he has seen
them in a different mood. Gunshots in a dark alley, 
</p>
<p>“They”
have them surrounded. Exchange of insults, “sons of an ox” for
“smelly worms.” Narrator's conclusion: “We understood each
other.” The narrator translates to Japanese that “they” promise
to let them go free if they sign a document taking the blame for
starting the fight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An
ample harbor seen from a nearby hill. “It was the last thing I
translated, before I became a boatman.” The boatman is speaking
with a samurai. After the events in the previous scene, says the
samurai, there was a fierce three day fight in Nagasaki, with the
Black Ship, “like the one in the harbor.” The boatman says he
doesn't remember the fight. The samurai is sure he was there. He asks
the boatman to go to the ship in the harbor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On
the way to the ship, he takes two passengers. Upon arrival, he
discovers one of them is a priest. They have a secret. Then, he
starts hallucinating, the ship is on fire, there is a big silent explosion. “It
all happened in my spirit,” he concludes, because he is now inside
the ship, waiting for His Excellency.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813913/files/20140826121149-1B_1.jpg?1409080309"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813914/files/20140826121203-1B_2.jpg?1409080323"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813916/files/20140826121215-1B_3.jpg?1409080335"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813917/files/20140826121230-1B_4.jpg?1409080350"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813920/files/20140826121250-1B_5.jpg?1409080370"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813921/files/20140826121311-1B_6.jpg?1409080391"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813924/files/20140826121330-1B_7.jpg?1409080410"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813927/files/20140826121355-1B_8.jpg?1409080435"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813928/files/20140826121418-1B_9.jpg?1409080458"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813930/files/20140826121447-1B_10.jpg?1409080487"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813933/files/20140826121511-1B_11.jpg?1409080511"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/813936/files/20140826121526-1B_12.jpg?1409080526"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><p><b>The

Negra. One Boatman, Two Ships”, is a graphic novel with a touch of
burlesque, slightly different from what you may expect. It is a
pirate story where you won't see any pirates and a samurai story
where you hardly see a samurai or two for most of it, but where you
may meet merchants and smugglers with their worries and fears,
priests with their secrets, soldiers, slaves, sailors and the works
of the Devil, a Portuguese captain and his pilot set on defying the
shadow of a corsair ship against the will of the passengers, or you
may cross briefly the path of an English samurai or an Italian spy.
You will surely meet the Boatman, the Japanese narrator, and his
hallucinated memories of his samurai years, mainly of a three-day
assault on a similar Black Ship (Nau Negra) he had completely forgotten, and
Reimau, a former African slave and hit-man at the service of the
pilot, both with dark stories to tell.My
name is Fernando Relvas, I am a Portuguese author of graphic
novels and I am the author of the story about Nau Negra, which means Black Ship, in this case the last of its kind, that made the trip Macau - Nagasaki, in the beginning of the 17th century. I carry this project on my luggage for some 25 years, when I
got a book about the Japanese Namban screens in the Museu Nacional de
Arte Antiga in Lisboa and I told myself I should make a story
inspired on them someday. But I needed funding to settle and do it, so I kept
doing other things, doing sketches and polishing the idea. Finally, by the end of last year, I could start financing the project with the sale of some of my original artwork, upgrade to a more recent computer, get used to a new software, and depart for the definitive version of the story.
But
that was last year, the trip is half its way, and now we are running
out of wind in our sails, and there's nothing captains dread more
than looking at a immense flat sea all around, the sails hanging limp
as the sailors go drained of all energy. 


We thank you in advance for your participation in this project. This
ship is now ready to take the Honorable new crew members on
board and, with your special contribution, make this trip a
collective success.As crew
members usually did, you may dislike the company of the passengers, their haughty manners and their habit of addressing
each other by Your Grace, Your Lordship or Your Excellency, mainly
when they are not entitled to it. You may call them that, if you
wish, just pay attention not to call Excellency someone that you are
not sure it is a Duke in the presence of a close relative of a real
Duke. This one may threaten to cut one of your ears.
Don't
worry, even sailors could be almost as powerful as the lords on
board, at times, because in the hands of the sailors lay the fate of
the ship. And sailors would use that power whenever they could. But
beware of the soldiery, gentry seeking fortune, and the private
swordsmen, they cause trouble for nothing.You may choose your place on board. On a big Nau (also written Nao) there is a good amount of soldiers and
sailors and, going up, carpenters, coopers and ropemakers (no ship's cook, you must do it yourself, and take care of your chicken, if you own one), with luck
a surgeon, the purser, the contramestre (sort of boatswain), the
mestre (the shipmaster), the sota-piloto (2nd pilot,
possibly even a 3rd pilot), the main pilot and the captain, amid other
staff like servants, clerks and officers of justice. In many cases
the main pilot acted as the actual commander of the ship, captaincy
being frequently attributed by favor or, as is the case of the Black
Ships of the trade Macau-Nagasaki, leased. 

“Nau
Negra” is based on documented events from the 17th
century port of Nagasaki. The fate of the ship I'm inviting you to
join is registered on the diaries of Richard Cocks, the English
factor of Hirado, based partially on information supplied by Will
Adams, known as the English pilot who became a samurai. This and much
more came from several sources collected and interpreted by the
historian Charles Ralph Boxer. The other great source of information
and inspiration are the already mentioned Japanese Namban screens
depicting the arrival of the Kurofune, or Black Ship. As for the
rest, we have to take the risk of trusting the scarred memories of
the Boatman.The
Story

From
the Introduction.

By the end of the year
1608 the crew of two Japanese Shuinsen or Vermillion Seal Ships, at
dock in the port of Macau, got involved in a fight with the
Portuguese. 


Most probably, not
even then, one could know for sure who started the fight, but the
Captain-general of Macau and owner of the annual trip to Japan –
made by the large Nau known as Kurofune or Black Ship – surrounded
and punished severely the Japanese crews.

The following year,
the Daimyo owner of the Vermillion Seal Ships complained to the
Shogun and demanded that the Black Ship be seized on arrival at
Nagasaki. 


The Captain-general
refused to be judged by the Shogun and fortified himself on his ship.
On the first days of 1610 a samurai force of the Daimyo gave the
assault.

Without wind and
having touched ground, the ship became a fortress under siege. After
three days and three nights of fierce fight, the explosion of the
gunpowder magazine finally sank her with all her valuable cargo,
killing most of the crew and some of the attacking party.

In less than ten years
after those events the last of the black ships would make the trip
between Nagasaki and Macau. This was not a dramatic trip like the one
that rocked the port of Nagasaki almost ten years before, but an
agonizing one. During the entire month of January and part of
February of 1618, the big Nau, full of rich goods, sailed on view of
the land of the Daimyo of Omura, under the threat of an invisible
Dutch corsair.

The
destiny of these two large and obsolete ships is not
only linked by the commerce of silk and silver between Macau and
Nagasaki, by the similarities and differences among several cultures
present on board and by the shadow of corsairs and typhoons, but also
by the scars in the body and in the memory of the Boatman.

THE SPREAD
In short, ""The Spread"" is a comic book about a sexually transmitted disease that turns the majority of the world into brain-hungry zombies.  If that doesn't do it for you, let us assure you that this book will not be like any horror or undead story you will ever read. It's a magnificent project, a story that takes us from today until the end of civilization, a story of human beings from every walk of life, and a story about the most fundamental human needs for freedom, lust, and survival.  And of course, there's tons of zombies eating peoples brains.  The comic blends some of the darkest, black-humor you will ever read, horror, science fiction, and maybe just a little bit of social commentary, all under the guise of a graphic and violent story about a zombie apocalypse.

SYNOPSIS
In the year 2011, an outbreak of a highly contagious and deadly disease envelops the globe. It is more horrific than anything the world has ever seen and quickly consumes nearly 3/4 of the earths population. The cause of the disease is unknown, there is no cure, and only a few pieces of information exist as to how and why this catastrophe has occurred. 

WE ONLY KNOW TWO THINGS.  First: the disease is sexually transmitted, and spreads more rapidly and impossible to prevent than any other sexually transmitted disease in history. Second: the disease turns those infected into sex-crazed, brain-eating zombies.

""The Spread"" is a zombie story like none ever told before. Follow an epic cast of characters throughout a ten year period as they try to survive, by any means necessary, and cope with not only the fact that the world is crumbling around them, but that the only way to survive is to suppress their most basic human instincts.  We follow a vast cast of characters from across the globe as the disease takes hold of the planet, and witness the reaction in all spectrums of humanity as the earth's citizens are forced between a choice of infinite celibacy, or certain death.

What We Need & What You Get
Our plan for this comic is straight forward.  We want to self-publish the first issue, as a sort of ""pilot"" for the series, and distribute them ourselves.  ""The Spread"" will be an ongoing, serialized comic book, as opposed to a graphic novel.  Our goal is to raise $2500 to print 1,000 high-quality, uniquely printed copies of the first issue.  We have so much faith in this project, and sincerely hope you do to, and we know that if and when the first issue comes to fruition, it will have legs of its own.  In the long run we plan to raise the funding or sell enough issues to keep the series in print ourselves for a long, long time.  

What we need from all of our friends and future collaborators out there is either of two simple things:
YOUR TIME:
-Spread the word about ""The Spread.""  Show everyone you know the trailer.  Direct all of your friends to this Indie Go Go page, to finktoons.com, and to our Facebook.  
-Blog about how excited you are for this comic, and pass the word along as well.  When we do inevitably print this book, we need people to be ready for it.
YOUR MONEY:
-We need to raise $2500 to print the first issue and work on some minor publicity for the release, and anything you can help us with is truly appreciated.  Donate 50 cents if it's all you have, and if you don't have that ask a friend to help.  Also check out the list of rewards we have for those who donate, there's some really cool stuff you can walk away with, aside from the general satisfaction of knowing that you helped make a story about sex crazed zombies come to life.
