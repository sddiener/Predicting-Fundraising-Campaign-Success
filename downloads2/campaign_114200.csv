<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>CLICK THE BOXES ON THE RIGHT WITH THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS ON THEM, AND THEY WILL OPEN AND SHOW YOU THE PERKS YOU GET FOR THAT PRICE. (Quite a few people have asked me about this.)</strong></p>
<p>Back in 2011, during a time that, to outsiders, might've looked like one of my highest points, but was actually one of the lowest lows of my depression and anxiety, I started writing this book. I had recently gotten out of the U.S. Army diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, had gone back to college, and got an internship at Comedy Central in New York City, 2000 miles away from the small city in south Texas where I grew up. While things were coming together, my mental illness tricked me into believing that I was incomplete and inadequate. I'd say that I didn't choose the best methods of handling that, but as you'll read in the book, I wasn't handling it at all.</p>
<p>I tucked the book away for a while because I was too scared to revisit the dark headspace I was in when I started it. Then, I eventually finished it, in like 2014-15, with some tweaks here and there between then and now, even tweaking into 2020.</p>
<p>Then, I was too scared to release it for a while because of how vulnerable it is, and how detailed it is about the mess that lived inside my head for a looooong time, and, at first, how embarrassing it could be for me, but then because of how embarrassed of me those I love could be. </p>
<p>But the more I read it, the more I felt like it could help other people like me feel less ashamed for the person that their mental health made them, and maybe give some hope that they, too, didn't have to remain that person. They didn't have to let those damn diseases win. </p>
<p>Now, when I read this book (which I've done AT LEAST 40 times through editing and audio book recording), as someone who has taken better care of himself for years, with therapy and PROPER medication, I only believe more and more that it will help not only people who struggle with things like depression and anxiety, but I also believe that it will help others have a better understanding of mental health issues like those. </p>

<p>I've definitely already spent a few grand on this book, and that's not counting the hours of rewrites and edits. I'm just talking about websites, professional editing, professional formatting, professional cover design, test pressings that I've used for promotion, courses and subscriptions about self-publishing and digital marketing, and some other expenses. And that's fine. If I had money, I'd pay for this all myself. But, as you'll read in the book, I never have.</p>
<p>So...here's what this money will go to:</p>
<p>1. I have some cool ""influential"" people who want to work with me on promoting this book because they see what I see in it. But...their time is valuable, and while they haven't put a price on their help, I have, because I've worked in the music and marketing business long enough to WANT to compensate these people accordingly. </p>
<p>2. Publicity and Marketing: I don't care much about the money I make from this book. Would I love to quit my job, sure. Who wouldn't? BUT...the most important thing to me, and one thing that's been keeping me from releasing this, is that I want to release this RIGHT. Nothing matters more to me than this book getting in front of the people who need it like I needed the bands I mention in it. And that's going to take a publicist and some marketing, which takes money. </p>
<p>3. Audiobook Recording and Licensing: Now, I probably still won't be able to afford all of this with this goal, BUT, if we reach this goal, it will set the book launch on the right track, which should hopefully get book sales to handle the rest. I've been recording the audiobook myself for promotional purposes only, and that's what some of you will receiving depending on your perk. But I'd like to hire a notable person to record the official audio book that will be for sale (and I already have someone in mind). Plus, I use a lot of songs in the book, and I'd like to include clips of some of those songs as a sort of soundtrack. And that's going to cost quite a bit.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
CLICK THE BOXES ON THE RIGHT WITH THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS ON THEM, AND THEY WILL OPEN AND SHOW YOU THE PERKS YOU GET FOR THAT PRICE. (Quite a few people have asked me about this.)
Back in 2011, during a time that, to outsiders, might've looked like one of my highest points, but was actually one of the lowest lows of my depression and anxiety, I started writing this book. I had recently gotten out of the U.S. Army diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, had gone back to college, and got an internship at Comedy Central in New York City, 2000 miles away from the small city in south Texas where I grew up. While things were coming together, my mental illness tricked me into believing that I was incomplete and inadequate. I'd say that I didn't choose the best methods of handling that, but as you'll read in the book, I wasn't handling it at all.
I tucked the book away for a while because I was too scared to revisit the dark headspace I was in when I started it. Then, I eventually finished it, in like 2014-15, with some tweaks here and there between then and now, even tweaking into 2020.
Then, I was too scared to release it for a while because of how vulnerable it is, and how detailed it is about the mess that lived inside my head for a looooong time, and, at first, how embarrassing it could be for me, but then because of how embarrassed of me those I love could be. 
But the more I read it, the more I felt like it could help other people like me feel less ashamed for the person that their mental health made them, and maybe give some hope that they, too, didn't have to remain that person. They didn't have to let those damn diseases win. 
Now, when I read this book (which I've done AT LEAST 40 times through editing and audio book recording), as someone who has taken better care of himself for years, with therapy and PROPER medication, I only believe more and more that it will help not only people who struggle with things like depression and anxiety, but I also believe that it will help others have a better understanding of mental health issues like those. 
Also, thanks to that therapy and those proper meds, I find myself so far removed from the ""me"" in the book, that I'm finally strong enough to set aside the shame and the fear, and to release this.
It's the most important thing I've ever done. And I've always felt that way, I've only now gotten the courage to actually do it.
Rock Bottom at the Renaissance - An Emo Kid's Journey Through Falling In and Out of Love In and With New York City
It's a book about, well, just that: Romanticizing things (love, New York City) to such a point that they almost kill you. It's about the mental illnesses that almost kill you. But it's also about music, and how the right bands and the right songs can keep you alive.

And that's fine. If I had money, I'd pay for this all myself. But, as you'll read in the book, I never have.
So...here's what this money will go to:
1. I have some cool ""influential"" people who want to work with me on promoting this book because they see what I see in it. But...their time is valuable, and while they haven't put a price on their help, I have, because I've worked in the music and marketing business long enough to WANT to compensate these people accordingly. 
2. Publicity and Marketing: I don't care much about the money I make from this book. Would I love to quit my job, sure. Who wouldn't? BUT...the most important thing to me, and one thing that's been keeping me from releasing this, is that I want to release this RIGHT.

HERE ARE SOME OF THE COOL PERKS...I'LL BE ADDING MORE AS WE GO ALONG.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi, my name’s <a href=""http://www.fayroberts.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fay Roberts</a>.

Alternatively you may be a friend, relative, or colleague. Hello!</p>
<p>I write, produce, and publish poetry and prose, and provide platforms for performers, focusing on providing spaces where people can be bold, and especially where they can tell their stories that may otherwise go unheard.</p>
<p>Short version: I wrote a show called “<a href=""http://www.fayroberts.co.uk/gigs/selkiepress.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Selkie: A Song of Many Waters</a>”, it was well-received, I performed it at Edinburgh Fringe 2016, and subsequently got so sick that I could barely sleep, eat, or speak. I’m better recovered now and would like to bring The Selkie back to life – give her a voice again. I’ll be performing the show at <a href=""https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/selkie-a-song-of-many-waters"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Edinburgh Fringe 4th-15th August at 52 Canoes</a>, Grassmarket, 12:30pm every day except Wednesday 8th, and – for once – I’ve decided to ask for people’s help to make this happen.</p>
<p>It’s expensive to take shows to Edinburgh – even with <a href=""http://www.thefreefringe.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Free Fringe</a>, an organisation I’ve been an active part of for several years now. Publicity, accommodation, transport, props, hiring a technician to provide music cues, insurance, costume – they <i>all</i> cost money. And creating merchandise to sell to try to recoup some of that cash means spending money up-front. In all it costs between one and two thousand pounds to take a show run of eleven days up to The Fringe. And no – as far as I can tell, there are no official grants available!</p>
<p>My health is fragile enough that working extra hours for extra income while I’m up in Edinburgh may very easily damage my health again, and I <i>cannot</i> stress enough how keen I am to avoid that! Similarly, in order to take everything I need with me, I need to hire a car, which gets really expensive really quickly.</p>
<p>You can help me by pledging money in exchange for a reward (anything from a hearty thanks through badges and copies of the book or album, up to a writing or performance coaching session with me, and plenty of other goods and services), or just sharing this with other people!</p>

</tbody></table>
<p> </p>
<p>(Total accommodation for my full time there will be £915, and transport £845.44, but I am taking another show (Other Voices Spoken Word Cabaret) up for the full run, so am assuming a 25% share of resources, for want of a better phrase, for The Selkie, even though I’m not running any crowdfunding campaign for that show.)</p>
<p>The perks offered are a mixture of physical (badges, postcards, books, CDs, etc.) and virtual goods (pdf of the show, digital download of the album), plus services (bespoke poems, coaching sessions, performances). The goods will all carry <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sadisoularts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sa’adiah Khan</a>’s <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1532534303539251.1073741830.841958429263512&amp;type=1&amp;l=d0bb9a0ab6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gorgeous artwork</a> inspired by the show, and will be signed by me – either directly or on the packaging. These will be unique mementos of the show or even more unique treats for you or gifts for loved-ones (bespoke poems are an amazing way to show someone how you feel about them, or to commemorate an event!)</p>
<p>If I don’t reach my entire goal. the priority for using the funding will be for <strong>publicity</strong> (without which I don’t get an audience), and <strong>support</strong> (technician – without which it will be next to impossible to run the show, and flyerer – without which I’m less likely to get a decent audience, and also run the risk of making myself more ill flyering by myself). The next priority will be to produce the book and CD for minimal <strong>merchandise</strong> (without which I stand less of a chance making my money back), followed by <strong>transport</strong> (without which I don’t get get to bring as many items that will help me run the shows and maintain my health while at The Fringe).</p>
<p>If I make more than my goal (!), the extra money will go towards my total costs of accommodation and transport.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I acknowledge that this is a niche project to say the least – not only is it an arts project, but it’s a poetry project to boot.

</div></div>","Introduction
Hi, my name’s Fay Roberts. You may know me from Hammer & Tongue, Allographic, Wild Strawberries, Other Voices Spoken Word Cabaret, Spoken Word @ PBH’s Free Fringe, the BBC Slam, or even Poetry Kapow! from back in the day. Alternatively you may be a friend, relative, or colleague. Hello!
I write, produce, and publish poetry and prose, and provide platforms for performers, focusing on providing spaces where people can be bold, and especially where they can tell their stories that may otherwise go unheard.
Short version: I wrote a show called “The Selkie: A Song of Many Waters”, it was well-received, I performed it at Edinburgh Fringe 2016, and subsequently got so sick that I could barely sleep, eat, or speak. I’m better recovered now and would like to bring The Selkie back to life – give her a voice again. I’ll be performing the show at Edinburgh Fringe 4th-15th August at 52 Canoes, Grassmarket, 12:30pm every day except Wednesday 8th, and – for once – I’ve decided to ask for people’s help to make this happen.
It’s expensive to take shows to Edinburgh – even with The Free Fringe, an organisation I’ve been an active part of for several years now. Publicity, accommodation, transport, props, hiring a technician to provide music cues, insurance, costume – they all cost money. And creating merchandise to sell to try to recoup some of that cash means spending money up-front. In all it costs between one and two thousand pounds to take a show run of eleven days up to The Fringe. And no – as far as I can tell, there are no official grants available!
My health is fragile enough that working extra hours for extra income while I’m up in Edinburgh may very easily damage my health again, and I cannot stress enough how keen I am to avoid that! Similarly, in order to take everything I need with me, I need to hire a car, which gets really expensive really quickly.
You can help me by pledging money in exchange for a reward (anything from a hearty thanks through badges and copies of the book or album, up to a writing or performance coaching session with me, and plenty of other goods and services), or just sharing this with other people!
 

What I Need & What You Get



Publicity
£347.20


Equipment
£22.17


Merchandise
£645.52


Support
£220.00


Accommodation
£228.75


Transport
£211.36


Total
£1,675


 
(Total accommodation for my full time there will be £915, and transport £845.44, but I am taking another show (Other Voices Spoken Word Cabaret) up for the full run, so am assuming a 25% share of resources, for want of a better phrase, for The Selkie, even though I’m not running any crowdfunding campaign for that show.)
The perks offered are a mixture of physical (badges, postcards, books, CDs, etc.) and virtual goods (pdf of the show, digital download of the album), plus services (bespoke poems, coaching sessions, performances). The goods will all carry Sa’adiah Khan’s gorgeous artwork inspired by the show, and will be signed by me – either directly or on the packaging. These will be unique mementos of the show or even more unique treats for you or gifts for loved-ones (bespoke poems are an amazing way to show someone how you feel about them, or to commemorate an event!)
If I don’t reach my entire goal. the priority for using the funding will be for publicity (without which I don’t get an audience), and support (technician – without which it will be next to impossible to run the show, and flyerer – without which I’m less likely to get a decent audience, and also run the risk of making myself more ill flyering by myself). The next priority will be to produce the book and CD for minimal merchandise (without which I stand less of a chance making my money back), followed by transport (without which I don’t get get to bring as many items that will help me run the shows and maintain my health while at The Fringe).
If I make more than my goal (!), the extra money will go towards my total costs of accommodation and transport.
 

Risks & Challenges
I acknowledge that this is a niche project to say the least – not only is it an arts project, but it’s a poetry project to boot. Added to which: it’s for a show that’s difficult to explain or describe, and doesn’t even have the courtesy to stick to one genre! And then we have the fact that I’m notoriously poor at asking for help (ask pretty much any of my friends or family about this stubbornness).
I’m banking on the audiences that I’ve entertained over the years, plus the artists I’ve hosted on innumerable stages over the last ten years, responding favourably to helping me out with a few quid each, and that some of them will be keen to get hold of the more elaborate perks such as bespoke poems, coaching sessions, and the like.
I will be using social media (Facebook, Twitter, Blogger, even Instagram, if I can work out how to do it!), my specialist mailing lists, and live performances over the next few weeks, to push the crowdfunding campaign, plus putting out a press release.

<div>
<p>Consisting of short stories, poems, essays and cartoons and

funny, angry young man’s creative endeavours and social
and political frustrations. Traditionally Cawl is a mix of
everything thrown into one stew pot and left  to simmer,
boil over and be savoured. Here Siôn Tomos Owen invites
the reader to choose what to taste next. The meat of the
essays, the parsnip of poetry, the spud of satire or the OXO
cube of comedy.
</p>
<p>Ranging in genre from gritty realism, macabre, sci-fi  and
comic writing, his is a collection that can be interpreted
as an anthology of more than one writer but written by
one author. The poems range from short rhyming poems
to long free form but consist mainly of valleys-based <i>Cwm
on ‘en butt</i> poetry including a centre-piece reinterpretation
of Rhydwen Williams’ epic ‘In Praise of a Valley’ from his
<i>Rhondda Poems</i>.
</p>
<p>The cartoons are a mix of comic-strip-style social humour
and satirical cartoons, heavily influenced by Martin
Rowson, Art Spiegelman and Gren.
</p>
<p>The essays blend humour and frustrated social commentary

We need £1000 to contribute towards the development, production, printing and distribution costs of this debut book from an outstanding young writer. This is not the full cost of the project and Parthian will also contribute money, staff time, marketing and expertise.
This is our first crowdfunding venture. We hope the perks will excite and invite you to support us along the way. Siôn Tomos Owen is a multi-talented creative individual who writes essays, stories, poems, songs and political rants as well as being a doodler and cartoonist. 
He recently presented the six-part S4C documentary series Pobol y Rhondda, a documentary series
where he met and drew a contemporary map of the people of
the Rhondda. 







We are offering a signed copy of Cawl, a doodle from Siôn, a recipe for Cawl, an invite to the book launch and a free glass of Welsh wine on the night to all who pledge £10.
If we don't manage to reach our goal through this campaign we will still aim to produce a debut collection for Siôn, looking into other possible fundraising routes and events, other traditional financing avenues, or altering either publication date or the size or format of the anthology to something more cost effective such as an ebook. We'd rather have a print edition though, as would Siôn.   About Parthian Books:
Parthian Books is a 22-year-old independent publishing house and a known entity in nurturing and promoting new creative talent in Wales and beyond (e.g. Rachel Trezise, Cynan Jones, James Smythe, Tyler Keevil, Rebecca F. John, Deborah Kay Davies and more). This is an experiment into alternative routes that may mean we can continue to do these worthwhile, but not always commercially-viable, ventures and services in an era of funding cuts to the arts.

Explication du projet

Mon nom est Kathleen
Desrosiers, je suis technicienne en santé animale, spécialisée en comportement
canin. Je travaille depuis plus de 20 ans dans
différents établissements avec les animaux et j'ai également plus de 6 ans d'expériences en conception, vente et distribution de produits innovants pour animaux. J’aimerais

As a two-volume project, the <i><b>I've Got Life!</b></i> anthology series will profile Black women, Latinas, Asian women, and White women from various paths. All of them passionately believe in making the world a better place to live and who have persevered with this mission for at least a decade, despite the challenges and sacrifices that only women have had to endure. <b>April R. Silver</b> (founder of AKILA WORKSONGS) will edit the anthologies.<br/><br/><div>
<p> The series intends to be bold and groundbreaking and it will explore the joys and pains (and sometimes the hard-to-digest truth) of what life looks like when you're a woman dedicated to social justice. Approximately 25 women per volume will be featured in the series:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style="""">Volume 1: </span><i style="""">I've Got Life! Persevering Women Talk about<b> Arts and Activism</b></i><span style=""""> (profiles of women artists and activists, mostly from the U.S.). Target release: Summer 2015</span>

</h1>
To independently publish the volumes, we need to raise funds!<br/><br/>Basic production and publishing costs include:<br/><ol>
<li>hiring a proofreader</li>
<li>hiring a graphic artist to do design and layout for the book</li>
<li>getting the book printed</li>
<li>getting the interviews transcribed<br/>
</li>
<li>compensating the women in the series</li>
</ol>We are turning to the community-at-large for support. Help us get these books to the shelves (summer 2015 and January 2016).<br/><br/><b>This campaign is specifically for VOLUME 1 </b>and we aim to raise at least $5,001 to offset the aforementioned costs. Your dollars will enable us to deliver a quality product to the marketplace...on time!<br/><br/><b>If you are able, please give generously</b> <i>and often</i> until the end of the campaign on Tuesday, February 10, 2015 at 11:59pm <b>PST</b> (same as Wednesday, February 11th at 2:59am EST). Your generous support could mean that we get to publish BOTH anthologies in 2015.

<h2>What Can You Expect in<i> </i>LIFE!
</h2>On a basic level, this is an anthology of interviews and essays.<br/><br/>Silver explains that on a deeper level, ""women will talk or write candidly about their social justice work, their victories, their failures, what they know, and what they are still trying to figure out.""<br/><br/>""Also, they will express what they treasure and perhaps fear about being <b>a woman; a worker; an intellectual; a daughter, sister, partner, wife, mother, caretaker; a bitch; an artist; a corporate executive; a pacifist; an atheist</b>...or about <i>being misunderstood</i> (nod to Nina). They are a small sample of women who have made life choices that no one should have to make and that half the world can't relate to. And 9 times out of 10, these women have made choices while wallowing in pain. But they persevered anyway, for the good of their families and the communities for which they stand. We should seize every opportunity to get these kinds of victories and cautionary tales out in the world.""<br/><ul>

<h3><b>What Happens WHEN We Raise More Than $5,001?</b></h3>
<p>We're campaigning to raise funds for volume 1 but over the course of 60 days but we actually hope to raise the necessary funds for <b>BOTH</b>
 volumes (fingers crossed). Whatever we raise beyond $5,001 will go 
directly to the production and marketing of volume 1 and then production and marketing 
for volume 2. Every dollar raised for the project as a whole will go 
toward making the series come to life, <i>pun intended</i> :-)</p>

</div></div>","To Our Community of Family, Friends, Colleagues, and Supporters.Team AKILA is happy to announce a powerful project that we hope will excite and inspire you.AKILA WORKSONGS INK (a new division at AKILA WORKSONGS, Inc., a communications agency founded in 1993) will publish an anthology series focused on women (ages 30 to 80+) from unique yet related backgrounds and experiences. As a two-volume project, the I've Got Life! anthology series will profile Black women, Latinas, Asian women, and White women from various paths. All of them passionately believe in making the world a better place to live and who have persevered with this mission for at least a decade, despite the challenges and sacrifices that only women have had to endure. April R. Silver (founder of AKILA WORKSONGS) will edit the anthologies.
 The series intends to be bold and groundbreaking and it will explore the joys and pains (and sometimes the hard-to-digest truth) of what life looks like when you're a woman dedicated to social justice. Approximately 25 women per volume will be featured in the series:



Volume 1: I've Got Life! Persevering Women Talk about Arts and Activism (profiles of women artists and activists, mostly from the U.S.). Target release: Summer 2015


Volume 2: I've Got Life! Persevering Women Media Makers (profiles of women activists in mass media, i.e., filmmakers, journalists, producers, etc.).  Target release: January 2016




Perhaps the best way for one to understand the essence of this project is to WATCH THE VIDEO of Nina Simone singing ""I Ain't Got No...I've Got Life."" The lyrics are perfect! In our view, Nina is #ArtsAndActivism personified and we're honoring her bold spirit by naming the series after one of her songs.Our Request to the Community

To independently publish the volumes, we need to raise funds!Basic production and publishing costs include:
hiring a proofreader
hiring a graphic artist to do design and layout for the book
getting the book printed
getting the interviews transcribed

compensating the women in the series
We are turning to the community-at-large for support. Help us get these books to the shelves (summer 2015 and January 2016).This campaign is specifically for VOLUME 1 and we aim to raise at least $5,001 to offset the aforementioned costs. Your dollars will enable us to deliver a quality product to the marketplace...on time!If you are able, please give generously and often until the end of the campaign on Tuesday, February 10, 2015 at 11:59pm PST (same as Wednesday, February 11th at 2:59am EST). Your generous support could mean that we get to publish BOTH anthologies in 2015. And it will most certainly mean that you'll help bring a lifetime of inspiration to people who count on the wisdom of women.

The Women of LIFE! (Vol 1 + 2)
Below is a partial list* of women who have agreed to participate in either volume 1 or volume 2. It's an amazing list of women who are 30 to 80+ years of age and who have been doing social justice work for at least a decade. Some women have achieved national and global acclaim. Others may only be known in their local communities. All of them have stories to tell that will inspire anyone who has boldly persevered for something they believe in, anyone who believes that making the world a better place is actually achievable!

What Can You Expect in LIFE!
On a basic level, this is an anthology of interviews and essays.Silver explains that on a deeper level, ""women will talk or write candidly about their social justice work, their victories, their failures, what they know, and what they are still trying to figure out.""""Also, they will express what they treasure and perhaps fear about being a woman; a worker; an intellectual; a daughter, sister, partner, wife, mother, caretaker; a bitch; an artist; a corporate executive; a pacifist; an atheist...or about being misunderstood (nod to Nina). They are a small sample of women who have made life choices that no one should have to make and that half the world can't relate to. And 9 times out of 10, these women have made choices while wallowing in pain. But they persevered anyway, for the good of their families and the communities for which they stand. We should seize every opportunity to get these kinds of victories and cautionary tales out in the world.""

<p>I'm I. A. Ashcroft, teller of stories. Some of my favorite writers include Neil Gaiman, Terry Pratchett, Margaret Weis, and, well, I could go on for about ten years. I live in a house filled with what some might call an unreasonable number of books, but I'd call whoever said that a silly person. </p>
<p>For over a decade, I’ve been chasing that wonderful writing dragon, and I would like to introduce to you my first full-length book for publication, a 95,000 word dark fantasy/sci-fi novel called <i>Raven Song</i>.

<p>It is the first of a four book series, and as part of the launch, I want to create  a professionally recorded audiobook to bring the world to life. </p>

<p>A century ago, the world burned. Even now, though rebuilt and defiant, civilization is still choking on the ashes.</p>
<p>Jackson, a smuggler, lives in the shadows, once a boy with no memory, no name, and no future. Ravens followed him, long-extinct creatures only he could see, and nightmares flew in their wake. Once, Jackson thought himself to be one of the lucky few touched by magic, a candidate for the Order of Mages. He is a man now, and that dream has died. But, the ravens still follow. The nightmares still whisper in his ear.</p>
<p>Anna's life was under the sun, her future bright, her scientific work promising. She knew nothing of The Bombings, the poisoned world, or the occult. One day, she went to work, and the next, she awoke in a box over a hundred years in the future, screaming, fighting to breathe, and looking up into the eyes of a smuggler. Anna fears she's gone crazy, unable to fill the massive hole in her memories, and terrified of the strange abilities she now possesses.</p>
<p>The Coalition government has turned its watchful eyes towards them. The secret factions of the city move to collect them first. And, old gods stir in the darkness, shifting their pawns on the playing field. If Anna and Jackson wish to stay free, they must learn what they are and why they exist. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, even if they do, it may be too late.</p>

<h3>Free Excerpt (Prologue):</h3>
<p>A boy lay on the broken sidewalk, eyes closed. He was pale and thin, looking not a day over ten years old. His half-clothed body shuddered against the chilly night air. His bony frame scraped against the grime of the street as he curled into himself, trying to keep back the cold. Overhead, the stars hung bright and lonely.</p>
<p>In the alley, almost invisible against the midnight darkness, a man stood tall over the boy. His well-pressed suit was as black as the shadows, as his skin, and as the raven on his shoulder. The way he hovered over the child, he seemed a strange guardian. But his eyes were turned upwards to the sky, away from the boy’s plight, as if it was no real matter. In those black eyes the stars were mirrored, impossible and brilliant. Those eyes stared back into the past, when the celestial lights were loved and revered, when each constellation had a story. </p>
<p>Once upon a time… this was when the world had sung to him, the dream-walker, the song-weaver, the star-stringer. </p>
<p>Once, before humans had forgotten his name.</p>
<p>Now, the starry sky was almost hidden by the glowing blue haze of the Barrier, a shield cast over what was left of the city: proud New York, ruined, rebuilt, defiant.</p>
<p>The stranger kept staring upwards into oblivion, even as the boy let out an unhappy whimper, chills wracking his weak frame. The raven flew from the stranger’s shoulder then, alighting onto the sidewalk, picking past the weeds and rubble. It rejoined its fellows who had settled amicably around the child, oblivious to the fact that ravens were all supposed to be dead. One hundred years ago, poison had leeched into the earth, into the grass, into the grazers, and into the corpses left behind. The blight spared little, its kind no exception. Regardless, this impossible creature affectionately brushed at the boy’s dark hair with its beak.</p>
<p>At the touch, the boy awoke with a start. His wide, uncomprehending eyes took in the world as he struggled to sit up, his head swinging around wildly, past awnings and high rises he had never seen, past scrawled words and graffiti he could not understand. He teetered to his feet, then fell back down again as his knees gave out, sending the birds around him into flight.</p>
<p>He saw no starry eyes in the darkness, no stranger standing nearby. He was half-naked, shivering, hungry, and alone, his head aching down to his teeth. The nameless boy shook off the dreams he couldn’t remember and wondered where he was.</p>
<p>If there had been any passersby on that cold autumn night, they would have sworn that this boy hadn’t been there a minute ago, and no stranger or ravens had been there at all.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>The <i>Raven Song</i> audiobook is an extremely low-risk campaign. The novel is finished, the ISBNs are purchased, the cover art is done, and the pages are typeset. This is ready to release now in digital or paperback book format (there is a hardcover as well, EXCLUSIVE to backers of this campaign). </p>
<p>The only question remaining is the audiobook. It will be contracted through Amazon’s ACX platform, which has been around for some time and will allow me to select from several professional narrators to bring you the very best experience. Though this is the first audiobook I have contracted, I have done extensive research and am confident that ACX’s narrators will bring you an excellent reading. This company and these people devote their professional lives to this, so this will not be an amateur work. </p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">La epilepsia musicogénita, según Oliver Sacks, es un mal ocasionado por la estimulación musical. La sensibilidad deja de ser un don para convertirse en una maldición; se pierde el control y el bienestar. Y lo más curioso del caso es que puede ser atribuido a estímulos sumamente específicos. A un tipo específico de canción.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>El asesino de canciones</strong> narra la historia de León, un hombre que se ve superado por el mundo y que sin embargo intenta encaminar su vida, al tiempo que se enfrenta a una experiencia musical perturbadora. Ciertas canciones excitan su autocompasión, lo inducen al desgarro emocional y se vuelven para él un incordio permanente. Obsesionado con esta idea, León decide eliminar las canciones sensibleras de la faz de la tierra.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el <i>crowdfunding</i>.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>Pablo Manzano</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Pablo Manzano</strong> (Argentina, 1972). Estudió Comunicación Social en la Universidad de Buenos Aires. En 1999 se mudó a Barcelona, donde empezó a trabajar como traductor de narrativa y realizador de proyectos editoriales juveniles.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">En 2006 se publicó su primera obra de ficción, <i>El rencor de los bufones</i> (relatos), y en 2008 salió su segundo libro, <i>El puente de la jirafa</i> (novela), ambos bajo el sello de Barataria Ediciones, editorial para la que además tradujo cuentos de O’Henry, publicados con el título de <i>Esto no es un cuento y otros cuentos</i> (2008). En 2009 participó en la antología argentina <i>La erótica del relato</i> (Adriana Hidalgo Editora), junto a autores como Patricio Pron, Oliverio Coelho, Matías Néspolo y Jimena Néspolo. Ha colaborado en diversas publicaciones literarias, como <i>Quimera </i>y <i>Boca de Sapo</i>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Actualmente vive en Viena.</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 800€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cuarenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>
</ul>
<p>Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán para sacar adelante esta primera edición de <strong>El asesino de canciones</strong> que saldría después a la venta.</p>
<h3>Además...</h3>
<p>Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y <strong>Pablo Manzano</strong> vea publicada esta obra.<br/><br/>Gracias por vuestro tiempo.</p>

De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy te presentamos a Pablo Manzano.
Pablo Manzano (Argentina, 1972). Estudió Comunicación Social en la Universidad de Buenos Aires. En 1999 se mudó a Barcelona, donde empezó a trabajar como traductor de narrativa y realizador de proyectos editoriales juveniles.
En 2006 se publicó su primera obra de ficción, El rencor de los bufones (relatos), y en 2008 salió su segundo libro, El puente de la jirafa (novela), ambos bajo el sello de Barataria Ediciones, editorial para la que además tradujo cuentos de O’Henry, publicados con el título de Esto no es un cuento y otros cuentos (2008). En 2009 participó en la antología argentina La erótica del relato (Adriana Hidalgo Editora), junto a autores como Patricio Pron, Oliverio Coelho, Matías Néspolo y Jimena Néspolo. Ha colaborado en diversas publicaciones literarias, como Quimera y Boca de Sapo.
Actualmente vive en Viena.
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 800€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cuarenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán para sacar adelante esta primera edición de El asesino de canciones que saldría después a la venta.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Pablo Manzano vea publicada esta obra.Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",0.0,0,"228 Campaigns

<h3>In Short...</h3>
<p>I've been a part of the online <em>CSI</em> media coverage for a decade, starting out on a very small ""Freewebs"" platform, moving on to Modern Day Sherlock based on Tripod, before finally settling in at CSI Files--a site highly respected by those officially involved with the <em>CSI</em> franchise. CSI Files has been a great foundation for me to evolve as a writer, and make a little money on the side. Unfortunately, the decrease in site traffic over the past few years has forced some cutbacks and due to those cuts, it is incredibly hard to cover the gas mileage, phone, train tickets, and other expenses that allow me to get to places and do things to continue pushing out content.</p>
<p>If you know who I am, you know that I adore what I do and love being able to update the fans with all of the latest exclusives and interviews. As with all things in life, money helps keep things going. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>I live just a little over an hour from Los Angeles, where <em>CSI</em> and <em>CSI: NY </em>are filmed. Over the course of the season, I make occasional visits to the set for CSI Files content and meet-up with the cast, writers, and crew for interviews. To break things down...</p>
<ul>
<li>A round-trip train ticket is $57.00</li>
<li>Gas is over $4 a gallon, and driving 65 miles is not pretty in the least.</li>
<li>My cell phone is on a 300 minute a month plan and it is the only phone I have. It costs $30 just for those minutes, and a typical interview for me lasts anywhere between 30 minutes to two hours. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This section is a beast to tackle, because I do not enjoy reaching out for money. What I do enjoy is being a fan that can connect with other fans via the work that I do. It is my sincere hope that the fans continue to choose CSI Files for their daily news and I would absolutely love to continue providing all of the neat stuff that CSI Files is able to tackle. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Having a diabetic child requires 8-10 finger pricks per day and 1-3 throughout the night to monitor blood sugars. Gracie is on an insulin pump, so her canula gets changed every other day as well. Unfortunately in children, it is often difficult for them to recognize when their sugar is dropping or spiking. This can be very dangerous, because they can go into a diabetic coma or worse, especially while sleeping. A diabetic alert dog is trained to smell the change in blood sugar and alert the child and/or an adult when a ""high"" or ""low"" occurs. They sleep with their child and wake up and alert at the onset of a problem. Our dog will also be trained to get help if Gracie were to collapse or just can't get to an adult in an emergency. These dogs are true service dogs and certified as such so that they can go everywhere with the child. Because these dogs are so highly skilled, they are also extremely expensive. The average alert dog is $15,000-$20,000. However, the Foothills Kiwanis Club of Boulder has a service dog project that trains diabetic alert dogs as well as other forms of service dogs. They are a very special group of people volunteering their time to change the lives of children with special needs.     </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The Foothills Kiwanis Club has two programs. The original program is for families of children 8 and older and they receive a fully grown and fully trained service dog for free. Since our family does not qualify for that program, they have started a new one. They felt like Gracie would bond better with a puppy. So In this new program, we will get our puppy, 2 years of specialized training for us and the puppy, the service dog certification, 2 years free vet care AND food all for $3,000!!! Here is the breakdown of the costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1800 Cost of puppy</li>
<li>$1000 Cost of 2 yr Kiwanis memberships for Joe and I which includes all of the training + 2 yrs of vet care and food</li>
<li>$200 Kennels, leashes, and other gear needed for puppy raising and training</li>
<li>Anything extra will go to a fund for future families to get service dogs through the Kiwanis program. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please keep in mind that these dogs cost between $15,000 and $20,000 normally if you go through the very few specialized breeder/trainers there are in the US. So the fact that we can get our dog plus vet care and food for 2 years for $3,000 is AMAZING! Our puppy is a Golden Retriever from a highly regarded breeder and will be chosen from their latest litter after the puppies have been tested and one is determined worthy to be a service dog.  </p>
<p>Because we are so honored to be a part of the Foothills Kiwanis Club of Boulder, and we believe what they are doing is making a MAJOR impact on those in our community dealing with special needs, we want to contribute anything we can raise above the $3,000 to a fund that they are setting up for future families who can't afford their service dog, but desperately need one. How exciting!!! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>   To explain why this is such a blessing for us, let me explain exactly what this dog will offer Gracie. First and foremost, this dog could save her life. The reality is, Gracie's blood sugar could drop low enough at night for her to go into a diabetic coma or even not wake up in the morning. We check her throughout the night to be sure her levels are in range, but mistakes can be made and children's bodies and blood sugars are just not always predictable.</p>
<p>   We will all be able to go to bed at night and not worry for once about whether she is going to be ok. At this point, I cannot even imagine that, but it may be a reality for us in the near future! I cannot tell you what that will mean for our family- to know that our baby is safe while she sleeps.</p>
<p>   Also, this dog will make every day life easier. It will be able to go to every soccer game, swim class, play date, and school day she has and will help her when she is distracted or playing hard, when its easy to lose track of her blood sugar level. This will also mean that she could actually get to go to a sleepover one day! Aside from the safety factor, Gracie will have a devoted companion that is right by her side wherever she goes. </p>

<p><span style=""font-family: verdana;"">It is humbling to have to ask you, friends and strangers, for money in this manner. I have been pursuing my writing/filmmaking goals for 24 years now.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>It's a relatively simple situation.  I'm trying to raise funds for the first print run of my children's book ""Wilson Puck"".  It's a story of determination, friendship, and having the courage to follow your dreams and keep trying no matter how many times you fail.  The reading level is at about a 6 or 7 year old level and is a great book to read to kids and eventually have them read it back to you!  It's perfect for any hockey loving family as there aren't that many hockey-related children's books out there.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The story goes something like this:</p>
<p>Wilson Puck is an ordinary nine year old boy that loves hockey, but isn't that great at it.  He's been trying out for his local hockey team for a while now but gets rejected every time.  One day, something happens to Wilson and some new friends rescue him from a tough situation.  These friends also provide him with new equipment that will help Wilson improve. Little does Wilson know though, that the only ""power"" this new equipment has is the power to give him the confidence to believe in himself.  Through hard work and the support of his new friends, Wilson can finally get a spot on the team.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>If I don't manage to raise enough money, then quite frankly I can't print the book.  <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>I have to AT LEAST hit $400 to print the book and cover costs ($400 
because indie go go takes a percentage and it will take some money to 
send all the rewards out).  If I manage to actually raise more than the 
$500 goal, then that would be phenomenal and could really help out in 
covering promotional costs.<br/><br/>
The first print run will have 100 copies, 24 pages for each full colored
 book.  The book has a $5.00 price tag and each contributor will receive
 a signed copy of the book.  The money I'm trying to raise will fund the
 print run, bookmarks, coloring pages, pins, and more.  There's some other great rewards too, like some of my graphic novels (signed of course), artwork, sketch cards, art prints, and more.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to donate anything, that's fine too.  If you do like the sound of this fundraiser though, it'd be really awesome if you could at least help spread the word, even if it's just on facebook by providing a link to the fundraiser. Thank you for taking the time to read this! I can't do this without you!<br/></p>

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Pendulum: Rebelling Heresy</strong> is a magnificent composition of stories about heritage and character.  Pendulum uniquely aligns tales of African descendants in both the Americas and Africa and further engages us into exploiting our own identity conscious norms that result in a silent conformity to these standardized systems designed to egotistically preserve whatever is conceived as the self or for the self. Expressively, Pendulum calls for the oneness of humanity into a non-resisting presence by living in momentum accord between what is known and unknown. Pendulum is for lovers of poetry, history, psychology, philosophy, entrepreneurship, and self-help books about how inter-personal learning can be transformed into equitable global investments.<br/><br/><strong>My name is Bruce Sakindi and I am the author of Pendulum: Rebelling Heresy</strong>. This book is focally directed toward the complex reconstruction of the African identity. I wrote this book because the entire world indwells in a destructive loot psychology that Africa is secondary and by default, as so are its descendants. This sentiment is exhaustive, oppressive, and deteriorates humane living when in-groups suppress out-groups. This book invites readers to reflect on their individual role in the cycles of hatred and destructive conformity. It further engages a willingness to evolve within us a consciously humane character that works against collusive obedience.<br/><br/><strong>My hope</strong> is that, in reading this book, you will discover that beyond the hold of any confining group identity or thought, individuals have within themselves, whatever is necessary to recreate and reconcile with their ever-shifting philosophies about living in a fixed world. By any means necessary.<br/><br/><strong>I want you </strong>to see this book as an opportunity to engage with your unconscious forms of egoic and eugenic superiority. I wish for you to escape from the mundane conscious negligence about the oneness in our being. And to learn alongside the heroic revolutionaries and freedom fighters of our times. Pendulum is about awakening and emboldening an inner space within us that is earthshaking, ego killing, and spiritually transforming our human bond into a deeply uniting, truthful, and fruitful being.</p>
<p><strong>In this book, you'll also join in me using language to render distinct aspects of the lessons beyond through poems like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>T.e.t.h.e.r.e.d. Canvas ""We sink our kin in pieces for peace."" </u><ul><li>Tethered canvas is about the space where our being is split between the known and the unknown; the pleasurable and the painful. It feels for the broken parts of ourselves that we hate the most. The parts which we cannot show to the world. Most times, it is our inherited trauma from living in our world.  Yet again, being a canvas, though broken, speaks into the content of our unbrokenness. How we can be both full and empty at the same time. This poem is about the way we love our kin. It is also about our desire to what is near and familial. It is about how desperately we hold onto that peace of certainty, so much so that if a piece of it splits, the fear within us, sinks us.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<u>Isano Ku Isonga "" Being African and human is finding a balance between fantasy and reality""</u><ul><li>Being is deeply about the worth of our existence. What is our value to ourselves and the world around us? The story of African descendants has had its fair share of compromise, surrender, and renaissance of its worth. And by the order of earthly standard, for worth to be credible, it must meet the prerequesite of validation. This poem is about the bridge between seeking validation of African worth and actually realizing its irrepressible existence. In Kinyarwanda, 'Isano Ku Isonga' translates to 'Oneness at Peak'.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<u>Poetry "" A foul tool and a fine remedy""</u><ul><li>How can one thing also be two different things? Much alike Tethered Canvas and Isano Ku Isonga, Poetry illustrates how the known can coexist with the unknown or how the dark can coexist the light. The opportunity that the Pendulum analogy gifts is the telling of an unshaken momentum between two dual and extreme opposites. As such is poetry. It is both a hidden element which requires reading in between the lines message yet it is also enough for the entire message to be drawn out. And even then, entirety or incompletion can also be debated.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>​<strong><u>FOR ALL:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>You will love</strong> this book if you are a student of the universe, passionate about understanding the legacy contribution of the African Continent and its descendants towards global revolutions. Pendulum is for every person shifting into a conscious sharing of pain with the aim to find oneness within vulnerable truths. More specifically, this is for anyone who feels a connection to the African continent, where human life begins. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that [Pendulum] inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who am I worthy to become?</li>
<li> Why is my world also your world? And how do we find a bipartisanship in our being and living?</li>
<li>Where are we now, how did we get here, and where are we going?</li>
</ul>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing [collusive normalcy, unconscious conformity, and identity reconstruction ] will change us all for the better.<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Book - [Pendulum: Rebelling Heresy]</strong></h3>
<p><br/>The book is written in 2 Parts....<br/><br/>Part [1] contains the introduction + additional chapters about the mediocre normalcy from which identities are constructed. Pendulum begins by leading an explosive discovery into the Eugenicist Psychology which emphasizes on biological superiority of certain human kinds. As a trajectory to purifying humanity, methods of religious doctrines, scientific human experiments, social, economic, and political motives subsequently result in a traumatic ""us against them"". This education legacy of passing on human trauma is copped with by a conscious conformity to structures of in-group identities. And by abiding to this collusive obedience, their is an outright righteously justified destruction of out-groups.<br/><br/>Part [2] contains Chapters where readers will learn to read in between the lines of the known and the unknown. This is the part about awakening to our worth and becoming. It leads the pendulum swing of thought into how to coexist together and find balance between the pain and pleasure  through stories about leaders and people we all call rebellious heroes. Conclusively, this part in rebelling heresy invites readers into a momentum of non-resistance within all that exists.</p>

<h2><strong>About the Author</strong></h2>Bruce Sakindi is the founder of Grow Up Smart Organization, a Non-Governmental Organization focused on building the potential of vulnerable youth in Rwanda, a Degree holder in Industrial and Organizational Psychology at Barry University in Miami, Florida, an avid world traveler and student of the universe.<br/><br/>He wrote this book because he is curious about listening to the unforgiving discomfort through which we separate our own being as superior to that of others.  He wanted to explore how we embrace extreme and opposite dualities as we indeed meet the choice between life and death at every turn. Choosing the title Pendulum is an imagery of the momentum swing of pendulum, going left to right, mirroring the oneness within opposites. <br/><br/>In his 22 years on this earth, Bruce has lived in Rwanda, Connecticut, Rome, and Miami. In between the third world, first world, modern worlds, and ancient worlds, he uncovered several thoughts about worth and way of being in our world. Bruce Sakindi is son to a liberation soldier and a genocide survivor of the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi. He is also the eldest brother to 2 sisters and 1 brother. He hopes writing Pendulum is an opportunity for others to share their journey of worth and living, as he quotes "" between the world and me.""<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Bruce at [syrbrucesakindi@gmail.com] and [Linkedin: Bruce Sakindi, Twitter: Bsakindi, Instagram:syrbrucesakindi].<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you.

Pendulum: Rebelling Heresy is a magnificent composition of stories about heritage and character.  Pendulum uniquely aligns tales of African descendants in both the Americas and Africa and further engages us into exploiting our own identity conscious norms that result in a silent conformity to these standardized systems designed to egotistically preserve whatever is conceived as the self or for the self. Expressively, Pendulum calls for the oneness of humanity into a non-resisting presence by living in momentum accord between what is known and unknown. Pendulum is for lovers of poetry, history, psychology, philosophy, entrepreneurship, and self-help books about how inter-personal learning can be transformed into equitable global investments.My name is Bruce Sakindi and I am the author of Pendulum: Rebelling Heresy. This book is focally directed toward the complex reconstruction of the African identity. I wrote this book because the entire world indwells in a destructive loot psychology that Africa is secondary and by default, as so are its descendants. This sentiment is exhaustive, oppressive, and deteriorates humane living when in-groups suppress out-groups. This book invites readers to reflect on their individual role in the cycles of hatred and destructive conformity. It further engages a willingness to evolve within us a consciously humane character that works against collusive obedience.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that beyond the hold of any confining group identity or thought, individuals have within themselves, whatever is necessary to recreate and reconcile with their ever-shifting philosophies about living in a fixed world. By any means necessary.I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with your unconscious forms of egoic and eugenic superiority. I wish for you to escape from the mundane conscious negligence about the oneness in our being. And to learn alongside the heroic revolutionaries and freedom fighters of our times. Pendulum is about awakening and emboldening an inner space within us that is earthshaking, ego killing, and spiritually transforming our human bond into a deeply uniting, truthful, and fruitful being.
In this book, you'll also join in me using language to render distinct aspects of the lessons beyond through poems like:


T.e.t.h.e.r.e.d. Canvas ""We sink our kin in pieces for peace."" Tethered canvas is about the space where our being is split between the known and the unknown; the pleasurable and the painful. It feels for the broken parts of ourselves that we hate the most. The parts which we cannot show to the world. Most times, it is our inherited trauma from living in our world.  Yet again, being a canvas, though broken, speaks into the content of our unbrokenness. How we can be both full and empty at the same time. This poem is about the way we love our kin. It is also about our desire to what is near and familial. It is about how desperately we hold onto that peace of certainty, so much so that if a piece of it splits, the fear within us, sinks us.


Isano Ku Isonga "" Being African and human is finding a balance between fantasy and reality""Being is deeply about the worth of our existence. What is our value to ourselves and the world around us? The story of African descendants has had its fair share of compromise, surrender, and renaissance of its worth. And by the order of earthly standard, for worth to be credible, it must meet the prerequesite of validation. This poem is about the bridge between seeking validation of African worth and actually realizing its irrepressible existence. In Kinyarwanda, 'Isano Ku Isonga' translates to 'Oneness at Peak'.


Poetry "" A foul tool and a fine remedy""How can one thing also be two different things? Much alike Tethered Canvas and Isano Ku Isonga, Poetry illustrates how the known can coexist with the unknown or how the dark can coexist the light. The opportunity that the Pendulum analogy gifts is the telling of an unshaken momentum between two dual and extreme opposites. As such is poetry. It is both a hidden element which requires reading in between the lines message yet it is also enough for the entire message to be drawn out. And even then, entirety or incompletion can also be debated.


​FOR ALL:
You will love this book if you are a student of the universe, passionate about understanding the legacy contribution of the African Continent and its descendants towards global revolutions. Pendulum is for every person shifting into a conscious sharing of pain with the aim to find oneness within vulnerable truths. More specifically, this is for anyone who feels a connection to the African continent, where human life begins. Ultimately, I hope that [Pendulum] inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:

Who am I worthy to become?
 Why is my world also your world? And how do we find a bipartisanship in our being and living?
Where are we now, how did we get here, and where are we going?
I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing [collusive normalcy, unconscious conformity, and identity reconstruction ] will change us all for the better. 
The Book - [Pendulum: Rebelling Heresy]
The book is written in 2 Parts....Part [1] contains the introduction + additional chapters about the mediocre normalcy from which identities are constructed. Pendulum begins by leading an explosive discovery into the Eugenicist Psychology which emphasizes on biological superiority of certain human kinds. As a trajectory to purifying humanity, methods of religious doctrines, scientific human experiments, social, economic, and political motives subsequently result in a traumatic ""us against them"". This education legacy of passing on human trauma is copped with by a conscious conformity to structures of in-group identities. And by abiding to this collusive obedience, their is an outright righteously justified destruction of out-groups.Part [2] contains Chapters where readers will learn to read in between the lines of the known and the unknown. This is the part about awakening to our worth and becoming. It leads the pendulum swing of thought into how to coexist together and find balance between the pain and pleasure  through stories about leaders and people we all call rebellious heroes. Conclusively, this part in rebelling heresy invites readers into a momentum of non-resistance within all that exists.

About the AuthorBruce Sakindi is the founder of Grow Up Smart Organization, a Non-Governmental Organization focused on building the potential of vulnerable youth in Rwanda, a Degree holder in Industrial and Organizational Psychology at Barry University in Miami, Florida, an avid world traveler and student of the universe.He wrote this book because he is curious about listening to the unforgiving discomfort through which we separate our own being as superior to that of others.  He wanted to explore how we embrace extreme and opposite dualities as we indeed meet the choice between life and death at every turn. Choosing the title Pendulum is an imagery of the momentum swing of pendulum, going left to right, mirroring the oneness within opposites. In his 22 years on this earth, Bruce has lived in Rwanda, Connecticut, Rome, and Miami. In between the third world, first world, modern worlds, and ancient worlds, he uncovered several thoughts about worth and way of being in our world. Bruce Sakindi is son to a liberation soldier and a genocide survivor of the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi. He is also the eldest brother to 2 sisters and 1 brother. He hopes writing Pendulum is an opportunity for others to share their journey of worth and living, as he quotes "" between the world and me.""For more information you can connect with Bruce at [syrbrucesakindi@gmail.com] and [Linkedin: Bruce Sakindi, Twitter: Bsakindi, Instagram:syrbrucesakindi].

They struggled, fell in love, worked, had fears, had goals, and simply did the best with the world in which they lived. I hope you will find pieces of yourself in them. Samuel Perry has spent his childhood on and around the Harlow estate with his sister Nellie close behind. The three Harlow boys, Daniel, James, and John, became his brothers while Lillian Harlow became his dearest friend. But when war threatens a changing world for them all, each one is faced with a difficult choice. To be the first to leave or the last?To follow family duty or their own?To confess the feelings that have grown since childhood or bury them completely with the men in the trenches?With letters tying them all together, the questions only grow, and the days and months drag on, and one year turns to the next. The Perry and the Harlow children soon find that none of them are safe from the grip of World War I, and each one is left wondering if they’ll make it out alive. If you like historical fiction or period pieces that envelope you in the past, then this book is for you.All My Love, From the Trenches is a book for lovers of the past, old souls, and those who read to escape to another time and place.What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><strong><i>Do It Anyway: Feeling Enough in a World that Tells You You’re Not</i></strong></p>
<p><i>Do It Anyway</i> takes us through a journey of self-exploration as we examine our feelings of inadequacy through the lens of our identities. Renzo Reyes navigates us through the unique lived experiences of tenacious individuals that endure encounters with racism, coming out, and immigrating to new countries, to emerge from the strife delivering successful pitches on SharkTank, filming on popular Netflix shows, and starting their own companies from the ground up.</p>
<p>—————<br/><br/>My name is Renzo Reyes and I am the author of <i>Do It Anyway</i>. The idea of this book stemmed out of my desire to understand my own feeling of inadequacy that would often be my biggest obstacle in the pursuit of my ambitions. As a gay Latino immigrant, I found much of what I was already telling myself was being echoed by my classmates, social media, the news, and everywhere else I turned. This same feeling I found reflected by many others whose stories I had the privilege to hear. We all need—and deserve—a solution, which is what inspired me to write <i>Do It Anyway</i>.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how your identities interact with your sense of “enoughness,” or lack thereof. With this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of pride and motivation I’ve recently found from fully embracing my own identities. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you challenge the negative thoughts you hear and the ones you tell yourself so you can freely and passionately pursue your wildest dreams.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about belonging and its counterpart, “othering,” before discovering just how to reprogram your inadequacy into your motivation. You'll read about the compelling stories of everyday individuals, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the multiracial descendant of a monumental Supreme Court Justice of color came to terms with the pressure to uphold her family legacy</li>
<li>How a young Black female entrepreneur captured the hearts of every single shark on Shark Tank before accepting the investment from the legendary Mark Cuban</li>
<li>How a Venezuelan-born gay man of African descent became a recording artist in South Africa after seven years in law under the guidance of his mentor and former boss, the illustrious, Supreme Court Justice Sotomayor</li>
</ul>
<p>You will enjoy this book if you’re the kind of person who is open to exploring your identity; or if you’ve ever told yourself, <i>there’s no point in trying</i>, <i>they’d never accept me</i>, <i>I couldn’t possibly do that</i>; most importantly, this book is for you, if you’ve ever been told you weren’t good enough, strong enough, smart enough, or just flat out, not enough.</p>
<p><br/><i>Do It Anyway</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to people of color, women, LGBTQ+ individuals, among many others, who simply want to pursue their passions free from the effects of the tiring, toxic narrative they hear every day.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book — <i>Do It Anyway</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in two parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the Introduction + Chapters One through Six. Here, we will dive into what it means to be “othered” and understand how it affects our self-perception, everyday behavior, and critical decisions. You’ll learn just why inadequacy—when left unchecked—can be so dangerous.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters Seven through Fourteen and the Conclusion. Here, we’ll cover the tried and true methods by which to reprogram your own feeling of inadequacy into one of self-worth and self-empowerment.</p>

He currently resides in Rockville, Maryland with his husband, Kevin, and their son (a precious two-year-old Siberian Husky), Kalel.<br/><br/>For most of his life, Renzo carried the burdening weight of inadequacy on his shoulders. Growing up as a gay, Latino immigrant, he never felt like he truly belonged anywhere. Into his adulthood, this feeling seemed to only intensify. After twenty-five years, he had enough. In seeking to make sense of this complex, his research led him to conclude that trying to beat it was the wrong play— he’d have to build upon it.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>New Light is a tale of young Mystics forced into perilous danger on their first day of public service.

<p>Diana Rose Dawson and Angela Malavolti are sisters with a common passion: using their God-given talent of writing to positively impact the world.  While Diana accomplishes this through songwriting, Angela authors unique and powerful children’s books.      </p>
<p>Diana has been singing and writing songs for over ten years, and some of her earlier work is showcased on her debut and sophomore albums, Diana Rose(2006) and You're Enough(2009).  While both albums reflect Diana's spunky personality and positive nature, neither is classified as “Christian.”   Diana writes from life experience; always from the heart.  The events of her life since 2009 have caused her to rely very heavily upon God, resulting in a powerful collection of Christian/worship songs.  “No Conditions” will prove to be her most authentic, inspirational album to date.  Diana is humbled and overjoyed to allow God to use her life-inspired music as a vehicle to bless the lives of others. </p>
<p>Angela has always been an author by nature, but her first official publication came to fruition in 2011 with her book, “You Are a Twisting Tornado.” “Universe of You” and “Santa’s Wardrobe” followed in 2012.  Her books are works of beautifully illustrated poetry.  Her message is always positive and educational; her inspiration, most often, her children.  She now edits and publishes children’s books for other talented authors with her own publishing company in Rockford, IL, Jungle Wagon Press.</p>
<p>These sisters share a similar passion for glorifying God through their writing.  When life delivers a blessing or an obstacle, you can rest assured these women are writing about it!  One such event occurred in September of 2010, which pierced the hearts and lives of their entire family.   Their sister-in-law, Jennifer Lynn Murphy, died at the young age of 31, after losing a life-long battle with Cystic Fibrosis. </p>
<p>JENNIFER LIVED A LIFE OF JOY.   She never took life for granted.  She never held a grudge.  Her glass was always half full, amidst the toughest of trials. She taught her family not only how to live joyfully, but how to die with grace and true acceptance of God's will.  She left behind a loving husband, Dan, and beautiful twin baby girls, Mady and Gaby. </p>
<p>Jennifer's influence inspired some incredibly poignant writing.  Diana's song ""When It's My Time"" and Angela's book “Heaven,” are direct results of Jennifer’s life and death. </p>

<p>If you find our story inspiring and are interested in getting more involved, please read on. Below is a breakdown of exactly how much funding we are going to need and why. We want to be as transparent about our needs as possible, in order to instill in you a great level of trust in us and in our work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>$21,000 will be broken down into the following:</p>
<p>$840 will be paid to Indiegogo for use of their site.</p>
<p>$2100 will automatically be given to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.</p>
<p>$7,500 will be used to fully illustrate, publish, and print a first run of Angela Malavolti's hardcover children’s book, “Heaven.”</p>
<p>$5,000 will be used to cover the cost of Diana's recording time in Nashville. This amount will secure flights to and from Nashville, as well as the recording time and production of 3/4 of the songs on the album.</p>
<p>$3,000 will be used to cover the recording and production of the remaining songs on Diana's album. This portion will take place in the Twin Cities area.</p>
<p>$2560 will cover artwork and distribution of Diana's album, as well as the upfront promotional expenses incurred for this project. </p>
<p>In the event that we don't reach our goal of $21,000, Indiegogo will take a larger cut of our earnings: they will take 9% of whatever monies we raise as opposed to the 4% that is charged if our goal is reached. If we exceed our goal with your help, you can rest assured that the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation will still get 10% of whatever amount we do raise! </p>
<p>What’s In It for YOU?</p>
<p>Remember, you're dealing with some extremely creative women, so the perks being offered are very reflective of their unique talents.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact </strong></p>
<p>The world needs Jesus.  We need survival tools to navigate through the waters of life. </p>
<p>“No Conditions” and “Heaven” will serve as powerful navigational tools in your life and the lives of your loved ones.  We all require soul-inspired music to move our spirits to a higher calling.  When our children experience inevitable loss, they will need a God-centered, uplifting explanation to help them cope, understand, and imagine Heaven. </p>
<p>WE WANT TO BLESS YOU with our gifts but we need your help to bring these projects to fruition!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">In high school I wrote a ""book"" for a writing challenge. Knowing full well that I couldn't write so many quality words so fast, I decided to delibrately write the worst novel of all time. But here's the problem- I fell in love with it. Seriously. It's one of the funniest books I've read, and it always gives me a laugh when I re-read it. And now I'd like to publish it to bring the laughs to everyone. Will you help me bring the joy of literature to the world? Also, will you help me publish this book?</span></h3>
<h3><em><strong>So.... What's it about?</strong></em></h3>
<h3> The Perplexing Journey of Frank is about an old man named Frank who loves hot dogs. Because of his undying love of this meat-based dish, he ends up traveling the world and traveling time to save himself, his love interest, and of course, his treasured hot dogs. It's a 4-in-1 type of book, so you essetially get 4 books for the price of one!</h3>
<h3>The books:</h3>

<h3>Book 3- The Hot Dog</h3>
<h3>Book 4- Frank</h3>

<h3>Break it down for folks in more detail:</h3>
<h3>So let's cut to the chase- money. How much do I need? Ideally, $3,000 because that would buy me a fantastic publishing package that would pretty much publish the book for me, because let's be honest, I'm just some middle-class white male that knows nothing about publishing.

<h3>Anyway, what do you get? Perks. That's right, perks. </h3>
<h3>Go ahead and view that perks list. Looks nice, right? Yes, yes they do. And the coolest thing is- YOU can earn them! Yes, you!!</h3>

<h3><em>How you make a difference</em></h3>
<p><strong>Well, you do. Trust me. To be honest, I've wanted to publish this thing for years. It's been on my new year's resolutions list since I wrote it. So will you help me out? </strong></p>

<h3>That's cool, I totally get it. I do. Because if I didn't, I could afford to publish this thing myself, eh? Anyway, you can still help out! Spread the word to your family, friends, dog, dog's friends, mailman, neighors, everyone! </h3>

And don’t worry: Every story printed in the magazine will also go up on our website, www.spokemag.bike, in the months following its release.Other Ways You Can HelpCan't donate? You can still help! Spread the word and tell your friends, neighbors, coworkers and fellow cyclists about SPOKE magazine. Get savvy online -- follow us, retweet us, and tag us on Twitter and Instagram under the handle @spoke_mag. Join the conversation and use #inmybikelane to show us what's in your bike lane.

<p><strong>December 21st 2012, marks the end of of the Mayan calendar's 5,125-year ‘Thirteen Baktun’ cycle. On this date, Peace 2012 and an alliance of many other organizations will gather globally in a unified ‘Moment of Peace’.</strong></p>
<p>These events will bring together spiritual leaders and indigenous elders from many traditions to be part of a <strong>'Universal Declaration of Peace'</strong>, a multicultural statement that incorporates affirmations of peace from all the world's great spiritual traditions and cultures. The Declaration will then lead into a simple moment of silence, a universal moment of reflection that anyone and everyone can participate in globally.</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to create a global ceremony to give birth to the Sixth Sun on December 21st 2012. This announces the beginning of new World Age and the renewal and transformation of humanity.</p>
<h3>A GLOBAL MOMENT OF PEACE</h3>
<p>Through a globally synchronized <strong>‘Moment of Peace’</strong> at <strong>the exact point of Solstice at 11:11 UT</strong>, we will make a worldwide call for the protection of all Sacred Sites and World Heritage Sites. This will be anchored with ceremonies and meditations at a number of these sites, inlcuding Stonehenge, Teotihuacan, Uxmal, The Pyramids of Giza, Chichen Itza, Lake Titicaca and many other locations.</p>
<p>Peace 2012 provides a simple, yet effective, template that invites people from all cultures to celebrate this singular moment in time, in any way that they choose. Events of any size and scale can be synchronized around the <strong>Peace 2012</strong> <strong>'Moment of Peace'</strong>.</p>
<h3>RECLAIMING CEREMONY AND SACRED SITES</h3>
<p>Since ancient times people from all over the globe have gathered at sacred sites to honor their ancestors and thank the Earth in sacred ceremony. In this way, many indigenous people believe, stability and harmony are maintained on Earth. Sacred sites are places of power and importance because of their geographic relevance, or because temples and sanctuaries have been built as places to hold ceremony and prayer. Many sacred sites are recognized today as cultural heritage sites by UNESCO for their historical and cultural importance.</p>
<p>December 21st is an opportunity for all these cultures to join together in one unique moment in time. An important goal of <strong>Peace2012</strong> is to support this and provide assistance in accessing these World Heritage sites for peaceful assembly and worship at this time.</p>
<h3>

At the same time, we recognize the underlying unity of humanity and all of the diverse lineages that make up the indigenous peoples of Earth.

Essentially, a man who we'll call <b>James Xavier Reed</b> hired me to write him a book and offered to pay me in advance. Unfortunately for me, the cheque he sent was fraudulent. It gets complicated from here, but my bank, Wells Fargo, took all my money and closed my account.</p><p>I spent the next week becoming my own PI, talking to bankers and the police and the company whose cheques were forged. The police told me there was nothing they could do. The bank told me they'll allow me to have a new account but that the money lost is my fault and they're not responsible, and they won't do anything to help. By endorsing a fraudulent cheque, I became responsible for the authenticity of that cheque. The company was happy that this got caught but there's not much more that they cared about.</p><p>Unfortunately, I'm out $2,000 with no legal recourse.</p><p>That's where <a href=""http://www.bartlebysnopes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bartleby Snopes</a> comes in.

And then I'll be providing you with a lot of different rewards for helping me out in this difficult time.</p><p>This campaign is to help me recover from my losses during the holiday seasons. Right now I have no money, no bank account, and no legal recourse. More than just helping me out, it's to provide you with some very cool things. And I've tried to collect some really awesome rewards for you.</p><p>I may have lost everything I have, but I'm very excited to generate content specifically for all of you.</p><h3>Anthology Contributors</h3><p>This list is subject to change but I'm both honored and proud to have such great writers lend their talent for this project.

<li>At least $500 will go straight into the making and printing of the anthology. Regardless of how much gets funded, this will be set aside so the anthology can happen.</li>
<li>I want money to go to those who are helping me out as well. The writers and artists who are helping me make this campaign happen deserve something more than just my gratitude, which they will have forever.</li>
<li>If we're fully funded, $2,000 will go to erase my debt with Wells Fargo. Once that's solved, I intend to never have contact with them again.</li>
<li>Any money made past the goal will go to the contributors and to further printings of the anthology.</li>
<li>If we don't make the goal, the money will be split between me, the anthology, and the contributors so that we can get you all of the perks.</li>

Essentially, a man who we'll call James Xavier Reed hired me to write him a book and offered to pay me in advance. Unfortunately for me, the cheque he sent was fraudulent. It gets complicated from here, but my bank, Wells Fargo, took all my money and closed my account.I spent the next week becoming my own PI, talking to bankers and the police and the company whose cheques were forged. The police told me there was nothing they could do. The bank told me they'll allow me to have a new account but that the money lost is my fault and they're not responsible, and they won't do anything to help. By endorsing a fraudulent cheque, I became responsible for the authenticity of that cheque. The company was happy that this got caught but there's not much more that they cared about.Unfortunately, I'm out $2,000 with no legal recourse.That's where Bartleby Snopes comes in. My good friend Nathaniel Tower, managing editor of Bartleby Snopes Literary Magazine and Press, is putting together The Revenge of the Scammed Anthology to help me raise money to recoup my losses. In addition, Ryan W Bradley, JA Tyler, Ben Tanzer, Broken River Books and many others are providing unique rewards for backers. And then I'll be providing you with a lot of different rewards for helping me out in this difficult time.This campaign is to help me recover from my losses during the holiday seasons. Right now I have no money, no bank account, and no legal recourse. More than just helping me out, it's to provide you with some very cool things. And I've tried to collect some really awesome rewards for you.I may have lost everything I have, but I'm very excited to generate content specifically for all of you.Anthology ContributorsThis list is subject to change but I'm both honored and proud to have such great writers lend their talent for this project. Without their help and generosity, this couldn't happen.

What We Need & What You GetI'm hoping to raise $3,000. This will be a great benefit to me, but it's also to make the anthology happen and give you as many perks as I can:
At least $500 will go straight into the making and printing of the anthology. Regardless of how much gets funded, this will be set aside so the anthology can happen.
I want money to go to those who are helping me out as well. The writers and artists who are helping me make this campaign happen deserve something more than just my gratitude, which they will have forever.
If we're fully funded, $2,000 will go to erase my debt with Wells Fargo. Once that's solved, I intend to never have contact with them again.
Any money made past the goal will go to the contributors and to further printings of the anthology.
If we don't make the goal, the money will be split between me, the anthology, and the contributors so that we can get you all of the perks.
So let's talk about your rewards for helping fund this campaign:

The Revenge of the Scammed Anthology in either an ebook, or Print edition.

Nathaniel Tower is donating a package of the Bartleby Snopes Flash Novels: The Rink by Matthew Ankeny, The Louisville Problem by CS DeWildt, and The Monster Opera by Nancy Stohlman. He is also donating issues 2-10 of Bartleby Snopes, along with the critically acclaimed Post-Experimental Issue.

Ryan W Bradley is creating original artwork for the cover of the anthology, which will be available to one backer. In addition, he's going to provide five cartoon face notebooks.


Phil Jourdan, great friend, genius, and benefactor is donating 8 books: 4 from Perfect Edge Books and 4 from Zero Books.

Broken River Books, the brain child of J David Osborne, is offering a bundle of their first five titles: The Least of My Scars by Stephen Graham Jones, Peckerwood by Jedidiah Ayres, Street Raised by Pearce Hansen, Gravesend by William Boyle, and XXX Shamus by Red Hammond. You want these books. Trust me.
Original artwork and writing by me, as well as offering my editorial skills to a few backers. In addition, all backers will receive an ebook copy of my first novel, Ash Cinema.

JA Tyler is donating signed copies of his novels Water and No One Told Me I Was Going To Disappear, which is an illustrated novel with John Dermot Woods. JA Tyler's one of my favorite writers and these are two of my favorite books by him.
The prolific Alex S Johnson is donating a signed copy of his novel Bad Sunset.
The always awesome Ben Tanzer is donating a signed copy of his just released novel, Orphans.

Susan Tepper is generously donating 5 signed copies of her novel The Merrill Diaries.
The beautiful Gregory Sherl is donating a signed copy of Monogamy Songs and The Oregon Trail is the Oregon Trail.

Alex Pruteanu is donating a signed copy of his giant and awesome collection Gears.
Every backer's name will be on the Thank You page of the anthology. In addition, if we reach our goal, I'll send a personal thank you to every backer and their name will appear on my website, unless they choose to remain anonymous.
The ImpactThe main impact here is that you'll allow my life to return to normal. More than that, you'll be supporting some very cool independent artists in creating awesome content for you. I will be eternally grateful to you for your generosity and I'll work hard to create amazing content for you. Other Ways You Can HelpJust spread the word. Or, the next time you see me, buy me a beer.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

I take the reader on a journey through my sheltered life in a polygamous family where I was home schooled, molested, beaten and trained to satisfy my father’s every sexual desire.

<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me make my dream a reality!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My dream is to become an author by the
age of 30 (on September 24, 2014) and help make a difference to
abandoned dogs, by writing a book that encourages fostering.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>About
me:</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Jadi Kindred and I started
fostering dogs who were on death row a couple of years ago.  When I
first moved to the beautiful province of Québec, I soon learned the
heart-breaking stories of overcrowded shelters, euthanization and
being the puppy-mill capital of North America.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.examiner.com/article/take-action-against-puppy-mills-quebec"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.examiner.com/article/take-action-against-puppy-mills-quebec</a></p>
<p>This inspired me to volunteer with an
amazing non-profit organization based in Montréal, called Paws for
Life. <a href=""http://pawsforlifemtl.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://pawsforlifemtl.com/</a></p>
<br/><p><b>About the book:</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the years I have been writing
inspiring stories about the abandoned dogs I have saved, or rather the
dogs that saved me. I would like to complete and publish my book about these
beautiful souls and how they have touched my life.

Help me make my dream a reality!

My dream is to become an author by the
age of 30 (on September 24, 2014) and help make a difference to
abandoned dogs, by writing a book that encourages fostering.

About
me:

My name is Jadi Kindred and I started
fostering dogs who were on death row a couple of years ago.  When I
first moved to the beautiful province of Québec, I soon learned the
heart-breaking stories of overcrowded shelters, euthanization and
being the puppy-mill capital of North America.
http://www.examiner.com/article/take-action-against-puppy-mills-quebec
This inspired me to volunteer with an
amazing non-profit organization based in Montréal, called Paws for
Life. http://pawsforlifemtl.com/
About the book:

Over the years I have been writing
inspiring stories about the abandoned dogs I have saved, or rather the
dogs that saved me. I would like to complete and publish my book about these
beautiful souls and how they have touched my life. 



Funding:
I will self-publish my first book through FriesenPress.com because it is an award-winning North American leader in the book industry.  It was also recognized as one of Canada’s Top 50 Best Managed Companies (2010).

<h3>My Story:</h3>
<p>I've been running an innovative clinic in Vermont since 1995, providing sliding-scale alternative and traditional medicine to a wide variety of patients, teaching peer counseling, and helping people to remember how to get close to other people and look out for each other without fear of becoming a bother to each other. When I became involved in the sustainability movement, I realized no one was talking about how to make our health care system more resilient, even though my own practice seemed like a good model of what small scale, local, low-carbon, non-polluting medicine might look like.  I set out to explore what post-oil medicine might look like on a larger scale.</p>
<p>This book, which will be published by Chelsea Green, specifically addresses the question of how to reclaim and revive our whole health-care system—from how we care for each other in a community, to how our hospitals will function in the age of dwindling resources—in a connected, loving, and powerful way. Using real life examples from places that are already starting to make changes, this book will teach you how to turn your own community into a place that is actively producing healthy people, and how to turn your local hospital or clinic into a place that functions as a community--growing its own food, powered by solar, wind, and geothermal, providing low-cost housing nearby for staff, and providing ways for patients to deepen their connection to each other and to the earth.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I need you? <br/></strong></p>
<p>I am the single mother of two fabulous boys. Most of my patients are rural low-income people and my annual net income is between $18,000 and $24,000--and has been for years. In order to finish writing this book, I need to take some time off before April and I need to hire someone to help with research. </p>
<p>The first campaign raised over $8,000 and allowed me to take several months off of work this past winter. Then I had to return to work. The manuscript is nearly finished. The deadline is September 1st. If I can take off another month this summer I will be in good shape to have it in by the deadline.</p>
<p>The book is going to be published, no matter what. Chelsea Green (they publish all your favorite books on permaculture, renewable energy, green architecture, sustainable communities, and local economies) has already signed a contract with me. They are a small publisher and they give small advances, and I have already been working on this book for four years! I have two more months to go, and although I am close to finished, there is plenty of writing and research still to do! </p>
<p><strong>What will the money be used for?</strong></p>
<p>If I raise the minimum of $2,000, that will allow me to take off most of the month of July, rather than squeezing my writing in after hours between work and my boys’ saxophone concerts and baseball games.</p>
<p>Additional funds will allow me to cover my writing expenses during the editorial period of 6-9 months, when I will be working with editors at Chelsea Green to rewrite sections and add in additional chapters as they see fit, and help to pay for me to go on a book tour when the book comes out (it's not like the old days when publishers paid for these things!).</p>
<p>Any funds raised above and beyond that will help this project to have a greater impact than the book alone. It will allow me to travel and speak at conferences, hospitals, and retreat centers after the book is published and to truly focus on implementing and sharing this model of health care on a larger scale by working with town and city planning commissions, hospital and medical school administrators, and Transition Town initiatives to develop health-care resiliency plans, as well as developing curriculum for a training program for community healers.</p>
<p>You can give any amount, it doesn't have to fit neatly into one of the perks, and you are free to choose any perk up to the amount you have contributed. </p>
<p>If you would like to give a larger amount, and would like it to be tax-deductible, please contact me at sustainablemedicine@gmail.com, as there are several non-profits who have offered to be an umbrella for this project.</p>

<h3>If you want to help but can't afford to contribute, that's fine! There are things you can do that may be even more important, for example, click on the heart button below the video, (so that I know you like it, and I can communicate with you) and use the other buttons to share it on Facebook or via email, word of mouth, or any other way you can get the word out to people you think might be interested.</h3>
<h3>Writing a short personal note  to a few key people is the absolute best approach (far better than sending it as a ""forward"" to thousands of people). It is also really helpful  when you do post it on Facebook, if you can say why you support this, and suggest  that people actually watch the video.. Passing it along via word of mouth and personal messages rather than just ""liking"" something helps us all maintain our human dignity. Keeping our communication human and personal is one of the most important things we can do in the world right now.  Thank you for keeping that tradition alive as you share this.</h3>

In 2003 China still had steam engines in commercial use. By 2007 it launched its first high-speed train. There is now 7500 miles of high-speed track alone. The innovation and development has been extraordinary. China has been condensed; provinces brought closer together, the experience of crossing the ancient Middle Kingdom changed forever. There are even plans afoot to build a high-speed line to Singapore, and elsewhere abroad. But many questions are also being raised. How much is big infrastructure being built at the expense of poverty alleviation? How much are overseas tracks, or tracks cutting through disputed territories like Tibet and Xinjiang, mechanisms of soft imperialism? How can the new railway be deemed green when the electricity plants still fire coal? And from an aesthetic perspective, is the new, sleek and sanitised experience of high-speed rail travel comparable with the gentle rolling of a slow locomotive that drove the stories through the golden days of rail travel (and travel literature)?</p><p>Travel by train is one of the great romances of the travel literature genre and in a vast, complex and diverse place like China, still the best way to get around and see the country. Indeed, it was the veteran travel writer Paul Theroux’s Riding the Iron Rooster (published in 1989) that inspired me to visit, live in and travel China. Though it is from this vantage point I propose to document China, the nation is no longer the one Theroux wrote about.

In 2003 China still had steam engines in commercial use. By 2007 it launched its first high-speed train. There is now 7500 miles of high-speed track alone. The innovation and development has been extraordinary. China has been condensed; provinces brought closer together, the experience of crossing the ancient Middle Kingdom changed forever. There are even plans afoot to build a high-speed line to Singapore, and elsewhere abroad. But many questions are also being raised. How much is big infrastructure being built at the expense of poverty alleviation? How much are overseas tracks, or tracks cutting through disputed territories like Tibet and Xinjiang, mechanisms of soft imperialism? How can the new railway be deemed green when the electricity plants still fire coal? And from an aesthetic perspective, is the new, sleek and sanitised experience of high-speed rail travel comparable with the gentle rolling of a slow locomotive that drove the stories through the golden days of rail travel (and travel literature)?Travel by train is one of the great romances of the travel literature genre and in a vast, complex and diverse place like China, still the best way to get around and see the country. Indeed, it was the veteran travel writer Paul Theroux’s Riding the Iron Rooster (published in 1989) that inspired me to visit, live in and travel China. Though it is from this vantage point I propose to document China, the nation is no longer the one Theroux wrote about. And while Theroux rode the functional, comfortless railway of Red China – one that still very much exists – I will be transferring between the old, new, fast and slow, as well as the light and underground rail, to try and tell the tail both of China, and its trains. For they both are moving, and at greater speed.Having lived and worked for the best part of ten years in China I think I can offer a unique telling of this narrative.

In short, I’ve been so busy dealing with fiscal matters that I have almost no time to create.
 
I’ve been lucky in that people have helped me with quick loans. I’m lucky - I have friends, family, and a job. My wife is starting a new job as well. But right now we’re running a Red Queen’s Race, not getting anywhere. Those loans are mounting and I’m tired of being a burden. I want to clear my personal ledger and be able to move forward. Microdonations would help me move on and get back to actual writing.
 
What We Need & What You Get
I’m trying to raise enough money to pay back those who have helped me over the years, plus the state taxes I owe.
 
I’ve several personal loans of about a thousand each, owe NY state about the same, and owe back tuition to my daughter’s old Hebrew school and new one. Additionally, I have borrowed against my retirement fund, life insurance, and my folks. I’m really quite pathetic, actually.
 
Perks will include: Random tech from about my house, prints and postcards based on the photos my wife and daughter take as well as content from Luchins.com, random comics, an exclusive look at scripts and stories, and being an official “reader” for my novel. I’ll be adding more as time goes on.
 
Should I not reach my total (rather large and scary) goal, I’ll still be keeping the money, and you’ll still get your reward. As they say, every bit helps. Should I reach it, I will pay off my debt and return to writing. Lucky you.
The Impact
Let’s be honest: donating to this project isn’t going to help the world. Even if my 12 year old reaches her stated goal of being a neonatologist (she’s wanted to be one since she was six. I didn’t know six year olds knew what a neonatologist *was*), my impact on the universe will likely be minimal. I just want my kids to grow up happy, and not have to worry that I’m worried.

<h3>Kort sagt</h3>
<p>Jag är född på Gotland där jag växte upp bland raukar och troll. Som barn lekte jag på magiska platser bland trojaborgar och rotvältor. Efter en längre tids sjukdom tillfrisknade jag med hjälp av healing och andligt uppvaknande. Jag har sedan dess vigt mitt liv åt att hjälpa andra genom medial vägledning och healing. </p>
<p>Min intention med boken är att väcka upp och starta helande processer. Tiden är nu inne för ett uppvaknande. Genom att ta till sig budskapen i min bok kommer man närmare sin själs sanning och energierna kommer att höja frekvensen för välmående. Har din andliga guide lett dig hit?</p>
<p>Nu när du donerar så öppnar du dörren till magin. Genom att boken blir manifesterad så sprids goda energier. När du väljer att donera och att läsa boken väljer du samtidigt ljuset inom dig. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Vad jag behöver </h3>
<p>Det finns e-böker men det kan aldrig slå känslan av att ha en riktig bok i handen. Vad är bättre än att ligga i hängmattan och läsa en bok, och att slå upp en sida i boken och läsa budskapet som visar sig? Den här boken kan du ta med ut i hängmattan år efter år ...</p>

<h3>Risker och Problem</h3>
<p>Jag vill ge ut min bok utan ett förlag då jag kan ha full kontroll över processen och boken. För att finansiera boken behöver jag din hjälp att täcka kostnaderna för lektör, illustratör och tryckning. Även om inte summan uppnås kommer boken att ges ut. Det kommer inte ske lika snabbt eftersom jag behöver just denna summan. </p>

</div></div>","Kort sagt
Jag är född på Gotland där jag växte upp bland raukar och troll. Som barn lekte jag på magiska platser bland trojaborgar och rotvältor. Efter en längre tids sjukdom tillfrisknade jag med hjälp av healing och andligt uppvaknande. Jag har sedan dess vigt mitt liv åt att hjälpa andra genom medial vägledning och healing. 
Min intention med boken är att väcka upp och starta helande processer. Tiden är nu inne för ett uppvaknande. Genom att ta till sig budskapen i min bok kommer man närmare sin själs sanning och energierna kommer att höja frekvensen för välmående. Har din andliga guide lett dig hit?
Nu när du donerar så öppnar du dörren till magin. Genom att boken blir manifesterad så sprids goda energier. När du väljer att donera och att läsa boken väljer du samtidigt ljuset inom dig. 

Vad jag behöver 
Det finns e-böker men det kan aldrig slå känslan av att ha en riktig bok i handen. Vad är bättre än att ligga i hängmattan och läsa en bok, och att slå upp en sida i boken och läsa budskapet som visar sig? Den här boken kan du ta med ut i hängmattan år efter år ...

<h2>Joyrider the Children's Book</h2>
<p>Beyond taking kids for the cycling ride of a lifetime, Joyrider is about taking on challenges, discovering unfathomable potential, learning more about the world, and having some fun along the way.</p>
<p>Joyrider shares the incredible journey of racing nonstop across the USA, covering its many landscapes. It's both a battle against the elements and the mind. More importantly, it is a story about the incredible human potential to overcome obstacles and shows the reader that they can do more than they ever imagined. In a fun and kid friendly way, the book introduces ""mindset"" - what it means and how it can impact one's journey. As the wise owl we meet high in the Appalachians, says, ""You do what you think and you think what you choose"".</p>
<p>For many kids it may also serve as a first introduction to a person that uses a wheelchair, or is a bit different than what they know.  Besides being a good opportunity to give a positive introduction, it shows that nothing needs to get in the way of a dream.</p>
<h2>What you are Funding: </h2>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The money raised through book sales and purchase of all other perks, will be used to pay the illustrator for painting the 32 scenes + book cover and<font> to order books, fulfilling preorders and creating inventory to get this book to more kids.</font></span></p>
<h3>About André Kajlich</h3>
<p>In 2017, I became the first handcyclist to solo Race Across America - a bike race from Oceanside to California. I completed the 3,100 mile race in 12 days and 16 hours. It was really hard. I had headaches for a month and numb hands for closer to 6 months.</p>
<p>On the drive back home, crossing the country, I decided I wanted to create a children's book. My goal was to show kids a little of what they are capable of, to encourage them to take on any challenge, and to try and show that the single most important thing, is to figure out how best to mentally approach it.</p>
<p>What's next?<br/>Maybe more races, maybe more books...</p>
<h3>About Jackson Mauzé</h3>
<p>Jackson was on the support crew of Race Across America and was eager to bring this story to life from the start. A teacher, writer and coach, Jackson specializes these talents with his focus in elementary education. He has written and pitched multiple spec scripts for children’s animation, has served as an AmeriCorps volunteer at an elementary school in Alaska, and beginning in the Fall of 2018 will travel to serve in the Peace Corps in Samoa as an English Literacy Teacher.</p>

<p>When illustrating a book, he says: ""My goal is to create an atmosphere that will help the viewer enter the story, without having to depend on the text. Sometimes this can be achieved with a few brush strokes, some other times it needs a little more effort, but in the end, if the fire that gave birth to the painting is still present, then I'm happy.

<h3>Update 05/07!!</h3>
<p>We have hit our £600 goal!! Hurray! But if we can stretch that goal and raise even more that would be a huge help; let's go for £700! Why?? See below:</p>
<h3><strong>Update 04/07!! </strong></h3>
<p>My application to Arts Council England for a grant to put on the show has been <strong>unsuccessfu</strong>l. The goal of this crowdfunder was originally to match the 10% of the overall budget required to make that application... now it's been unsuccessful, it means that <strong>this fund is all we've got. </strong></p>
<p>Therefore, it's more important than ever to reach the £600 (or more!!) now, and we've only got until tomorrow. I cannot ask or beg you enough - please donate anything you can afford, please share, please shout about this project from the rooftops if you care about <strong>supporting emerging (marginalised) artists, diversifying literary history, and inciting climate action. </strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Read the full update on the updates tab.</i></strong></p>
<h2>""Sweet Thames, run softly til I end my song""</h2>
<p>I am Izzy Inkpen, an emerging, inter-disciplinary artist, and last year I wrote, produced, and performed a <strong>promenade spoken word</strong> show called <i><a href=""http://www.izzyinkpen.co.uk/run-softly"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Run Softly</a>, </i>as part of <a href=""http://totallythames.org/event/run-softly"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Totally Thames 2018</a>. It received <strong>glowing reviews </strong>and had no rating below <strong>8/10</strong>. This year, I am seeking funds to make it even better by involving other <strong>early-career artists</strong> to reflect the breadth of experiences and identities in London.</p>
<p><i>Run Softly</i> responds to and re-imagines pieces of <strong>literature about the Thames</strong>, from Old English to contemporary writing, and focuses on celebrating <strong>marginalised voices </strong>and <strong>forgotten history.</strong> It also tracks how human habitation has changed the river's landscape over time and addresses the threats it faces due to <strong>climate change</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Your generous donations will go towards preserving the fascinating, diverse history of London’s ancient river, and inspiring the readers and audience to protect its future.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>Currently, when you search for “literature about the Thames”, you get Edmund Spenser, Charles Dickens, and T.S Eliot. They're great writers, but poetry has been reduced to an exam-tested canon of mostly white, straight, male writers; it's time to make poetry accessible, engaging, and showcase the beautifully diverse writers of London. Plus, given the current public attention to the climate crisis and the society we want to build, I believe now is the perfect time to cultivate a dialogue around the history <i>and</i> future of the Thames.</p>
<p>My key priorities are for Run Softly to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Supportive</strong>: a development opportunity for early-career writers, with personal mentoring and a printed anthology of their work.</li>
<li>
<strong>Diverse</strong>: honour the cultural heritage of the Thames and diversify the literary canon.</li>
<li>
<strong>Urgent</strong>: incite the audience and readers to environmental action with specific information about the affect of climate change on the Thames.</li>
<li>
<strong>Accessible</strong>: the performance area is wheelchair accessible, and tickets are just £4.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>The primary goal of this fundraiser is to match <strong>10% of the total project</strong> <strong>budget</strong>, which is necessary for an <strong>Arts Council England Grant</strong>. Since my proposed budget is £5600, the goal of £600 is therefore a safe 10%, and shows ACE that people are keen to see <i>Run Softly</i> happen. The main bulk of this funding will go towards <strong>paying the artists fairly</strong> for their writing and performances. The remaining goes towards <strong>publicity photos, props, </strong>and<strong> printing the zine of the work</strong> (hopefully on recycled paper!).</p>
<p>That said, it would be great to exceed the goal. In the event I do not achieve ACE funding, all the money from this crowdfunder will go directly towards the artists’ fees, so the more the better!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I feel Run Softly has real potential for being an <strong>eye-opening, educational, engaging</strong> work, and you don’t just have to take my word for it: in 2018 on the feedback cards given to the audience, there was no rating below an <strong>8/10</strong>! (eleven people gave it <strong>10/10</strong>!)  Here are some of the reviews:</p>
<ul>
<li>“it's <strong>one of a kind</strong> and a must see” - twitter</li>
<li>“You can really see the amount of <strong>creative spirit</strong> and thought that was put into this show!” - twitter</li>
<li> “Excellent; <strong>making the familiar new</strong>” – feedback card</li>
<li>“Really thoughtful, social, <strong>democratic</strong>, stimulating” – feedback card</li>
<li>“in einer anderen Zeit versetz <i>(puts you in <strong>another time</strong>)</i>” – feedback card</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Perks!</h3>
<p>Whether you're more about the poetry, or more about saving the environment, I've got the perks for you. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original <i>Run Softly</i> zine - limited edition!</li>
<li>Cleaning up the Thames after each show</li>
<li>Personal feedback on you poetry</li>
<li>A full summary report on how climate change is affecting the Thames</li>
</ul>
<p>And many more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Share with your book-nerd, theatre-nerd, and environmentalist friends!</li>
<li>
<u><a href=""http://www.izzyinkpen.co.uk/rs19-newsletter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sign up to the newsletter</a></u> tracking the process of Run Softly </li>
<li>Come along to the show in September, or buy the zine when it comes out!</li>
</ul>
<h3>What if the money isn't raised?</h3>
<p>Even if this funder does not reach its entire goal, it is still a big boost to my ACE grant. <i>Run Softly</i> will happen regardless if I get full funding – but this means I will struggle to pay the artists properly, so if I can raise more here, that is a greater safety net.</p>

Read the full update on the updates tab.
""Sweet Thames, run softly til I end my song""
I am Izzy Inkpen, an emerging, inter-disciplinary artist, and last year I wrote, produced, and performed a promenade spoken word show called Run Softly, as part of Totally Thames 2018. It received glowing reviews and had no rating below 8/10. This year, I am seeking funds to make it even better by involving other early-career artists to reflect the breadth of experiences and identities in London.
Run Softly responds to and re-imagines pieces of literature about the Thames, from Old English to contemporary writing, and focuses on celebrating marginalised voices and forgotten history. It also tracks how human habitation has changed the river's landscape over time and addresses the threats it faces due to climate change.
Your generous donations will go towards preserving the fascinating, diverse history of London’s ancient river, and inspiring the readers and audience to protect its future.

The Vision
Currently, when you search for “literature about the Thames”, you get Edmund Spenser, Charles Dickens, and T.S Eliot. They're great writers, but poetry has been reduced to an exam-tested canon of mostly white, straight, male writers; it's time to make poetry accessible, engaging, and showcase the beautifully diverse writers of London. Plus, given the current public attention to the climate crisis and the society we want to build, I believe now is the perfect time to cultivate a dialogue around the history and future of the Thames.
My key priorities are for Run Softly to be:


Supportive: a development opportunity for early-career writers, with personal mentoring and a printed anthology of their work.

Diverse: honour the cultural heritage of the Thames and diversify the literary canon.

Urgent: incite the audience and readers to environmental action with specific information about the affect of climate change on the Thames.

Accessible: the performance area is wheelchair accessible, and tickets are just £4.

What I Need
The primary goal of this fundraiser is to match 10% of the total project budget, which is necessary for an Arts Council England Grant. Since my proposed budget is £5600, the goal of £600 is therefore a safe 10%, and shows ACE that people are keen to see Run Softly happen. The main bulk of this funding will go towards paying the artists fairly for their writing and performances. The remaining goes towards publicity photos, props, and printing the zine of the work (hopefully on recycled paper!).
That said, it would be great to exceed the goal. In the event I do not achieve ACE funding, all the money from this crowdfunder will go directly towards the artists’ fees, so the more the better!

The Impact
I feel Run Softly has real potential for being an eye-opening, educational, engaging work, and you don’t just have to take my word for it: in 2018 on the feedback cards given to the audience, there was no rating below an 8/10! (eleven people gave it 10/10!)  Here are some of the reviews:

“it's one of a kind and a must see” - twitter
“You can really see the amount of creative spirit and thought that was put into this show!” - twitter
 “Excellent; making the familiar new” – feedback card
“Really thoughtful, social, democratic, stimulating” – feedback card
“in einer anderen Zeit versetz (puts you in another time)” – feedback card

The Perks!
Whether you're more about the poetry, or more about saving the environment, I've got the perks for you. They include:

The original Run Softly zine - limited edition!
Cleaning up the Thames after each show
Personal feedback on you poetry
A full summary report on how climate change is affecting the Thames

And many more!

Other Ways You Can Help

Share with your book-nerd, theatre-nerd, and environmentalist friends!

Sign up to the newsletter tracking the process of Run Softly 
Come along to the show in September, or buy the zine when it comes out!

What if the money isn't raised?
Even if this funder does not reach its entire goal, it is still a big boost to my ACE grant. Run Softly will happen regardless if I get full funding – but this means I will struggle to pay the artists properly, so if I can raise more here, that is a greater safety net.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Todd Brown and I served in the US Army Infantry from 1993-1997.  I spent 1 year in Korea and 3 years @ Fort Bragg in the 82nd Airborne Infantry division.  While @ Fort Bragg my unit was sent to Porta Prince Haiti for 2 weeks to break up gang activity but was stranded for 4 weeks due to aircraft failure.  During that time I saw things that are too grafice to describe.  Due to this and things that happened in Korea I now suffer from PTSD.  I also have many medical issues that have caused the rehabilitation program of the VA to deem me unemployable.  I have been fighting the VA for over 3 years for full disability benefits.  This is causing severe depression because I feel like I cant even support my family.  My wife is currently working 2 jobs trying to support our family.  She is currently suffering from severe anxiety and stress because of all this.  A few months ago she found a program in Peachtree City called Healing4Heros.  They help veterans with service dogs to help with PTSD and tramatic brain injuries.  They rescue dogs from local shelters to train.  There is no cost to the veteran but they need donations to help with supplies and training for them.  It costs $6000.00 to train 25 dogs with their veteran &amp; supplies donate to healing4heroes.org.  They are also requiring me to have a fence around our back yard do to neighbors that dont obay leash laws and wild dogs ect.  This is why I need to raise funds.  It is going to cost about $8000.00 for 800 linear feet of fence (and this isnt fencing my entire back yard).  Any remaining funds I raise be donated back to Healing4Heros for dog food, leashes and other supplies needed for the dogs.  Please help my family bring our dog home.   Thanks in advance for ANY help you can give us and Healing4Heros.  If you need to reach me please call me @ 404-910-6388.</p>

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p>El Capitán Berenjena y los héroes de Alegoría os transportará a mundos mágicos muy parecidos a este.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El reino de Alegoría está a punto de desaparecer de la forma más horrible. La reina, desesperada, ha tratado por todos los medios de localizar a la única persona capaz de ayudarles, pero el Capitán Berenjena ha desaparecido sin dejar rastro y nadie sabe su paradero.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Ante esta terrible situación, y temiendo que algo malo haya podido sucederle, la reina envía a tres extraordinarios jóvenes a buscarle, con la intención de salvar su reino de los diabólicos planes del malvado duque de Morton, un despiadado brujo famoso por su crueldad.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A través de mares, océanos, planetas y galaxias, estos tres maravillosos héroes conocerán a increíbles personajes y vivirán su aventura más épica, unidos por su gran sentido del honor, su lealtad y su amor por Alegoría.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">¿Lograrán encontrar al Capitán Berenjena? ¿Conseguirán salvar al reino de Alegoría? En esta nueva aventura, el mayor secreto del famoso capitán pirata será desvelado para siempre. ¿Te atreves a embarcar con nuestros héroes en este fantástico viaje?</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia </strong>es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy os presentamos a <strong>José Miguel Moras</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nacido en 1974 en Barcelona, estudió Ingeniería Informática y ha dedicado su carrera profesional a las Tecnologías de la Información y Comunicaciones desde hace más de veinte años. Sin embargo, el título que con mayor ilusión ostenta, es el de ser padre de familia numerosa.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Con su esposa y sus tres pequeños, vive momentos mágicos en el salón de su casa, explicándoles cuentos que hacen volar su imaginación y que les transportan a mundos de fantasía e ilusión. En cierta ocasión, a la hora de la cena, una de aquellas historias les encantó. Se trataba de las hazañas de un extraordinario capitán pirata que tenía un barco mágico con forma de berenjena y que surcaba el espacio infinito. Al comprobar el enorme impacto que las historias del bravo capitán tenían en sus hijos, decidió publicar su primer libro, <i>El Capitán Berenjena</i>, cosechando un gran éxito y reconocimiento por parte del público, y donando todo lo recaudado a una entidad benéfica.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A raíz de aquella maravillosa experiencia, y animado por sus lectores, José Miguel Moras vuelve con esta mágica aventura, que hará las delicias de niños y mayores.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Una vez más, el objetivo del proyecto es totalmente solidario, y todo lo recaudado por el autor será donado íntegramente a una entidad benéfica, porque eso, querido lector, es exactamente lo que haría El Capitán Berenjena.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Esa noche, tras la enorme explosión, el Capitán Berenjena cayó al mar desde una gran altura. Inmovilizado por el dolor, mientras se hundía en aquellas frías aguas, sintió como si millones de agujas se le clavaran por todo el cuerpo y supo que aquel era el fin. No temía a la muerte, pues no era el final del camino, sino una puerta que se abría ahora ante él. Al otro lado le esperaba su padre y, con tan magnífica compañía, no tenía nada que temer. El silencio y la oscuridad del fondo del mar le transmitían mucha paz. Cerró los ojos y, poco a poco, su corazón dejó de latir»</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«Todo comenzó unos días antes, cuando, al alba, la reina Lydia subió las escaleras de la torre más alta del palacio real. Desde allí, entre las almenas, vio partir a tres jinetes que cabalgaban al galope. Al llegar al cruce de la vega, cada uno de ellos tomó una dirección diferente y se alejaron por el horizonte.<br/>            La reina Lydia, muy triste, pensó:<br/>            —Cabalgad, mis queridos heraldos. Encontradlos y transmitidles el mensaje. El reino de Alegoría está en peligro y el destino de todos nosotros está ahora en vuestras manos.<br/>            Después, agarró fuertemente el colgante de su pecho y, mirando al cielo, dijo:<br/>            —Capitán Berenjena, ¿por qué no vienes a ayudarnos? —y se puso a llorar amargamente, para dar salida al inmenso dolor que sentía en su corazón»</p>
<h3>¿Cómo?</h3>
<p>Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.</p>
<ul>
<li>Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.</li>
<li>Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.</li>

</div></div>","¿Qué?
El Capitán Berenjena y los héroes de Alegoría os transportará a mundos mágicos muy parecidos a este.
El reino de Alegoría está a punto de desaparecer de la forma más horrible. La reina, desesperada, ha tratado por todos los medios de localizar a la única persona capaz de ayudarles, pero el Capitán Berenjena ha desaparecido sin dejar rastro y nadie sabe su paradero.
Ante esta terrible situación, y temiendo que algo malo haya podido sucederle, la reina envía a tres extraordinarios jóvenes a buscarle, con la intención de salvar su reino de los diabólicos planes del malvado duque de Morton, un despiadado brujo famoso por su crueldad.
A través de mares, océanos, planetas y galaxias, estos tres maravillosos héroes conocerán a increíbles personajes y vivirán su aventura más épica, unidos por su gran sentido del honor, su lealtad y su amor por Alegoría.
¿Lograrán encontrar al Capitán Berenjena? ¿Conseguirán salvar al reino de Alegoría? En esta nueva aventura, el mayor secreto del famoso capitán pirata será desvelado para siempre. ¿Te atreves a embarcar con nuestros héroes en este fantástico viaje?
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy os presentamos a José Miguel Moras.
Nacido en 1974 en Barcelona, estudió Ingeniería Informática y ha dedicado su carrera profesional a las Tecnologías de la Información y Comunicaciones desde hace más de veinte años. Sin embargo, el título que con mayor ilusión ostenta, es el de ser padre de familia numerosa.
Con su esposa y sus tres pequeños, vive momentos mágicos en el salón de su casa, explicándoles cuentos que hacen volar su imaginación y que les transportan a mundos de fantasía e ilusión. En cierta ocasión, a la hora de la cena, una de aquellas historias les encantó. Se trataba de las hazañas de un extraordinario capitán pirata que tenía un barco mágico con forma de berenjena y que surcaba el espacio infinito. Al comprobar el enorme impacto que las historias del bravo capitán tenían en sus hijos, decidió publicar su primer libro, El Capitán Berenjena, cosechando un gran éxito y reconocimiento por parte del público, y donando todo lo recaudado a una entidad benéfica.
A raíz de aquella maravillosa experiencia, y animado por sus lectores, José Miguel Moras vuelve con esta mágica aventura, que hará las delicias de niños y mayores.
Una vez más, el objetivo del proyecto es totalmente solidario, y todo lo recaudado por el autor será donado íntegramente a una entidad benéfica, porque eso, querido lector, es exactamente lo que haría El Capitán Berenjena.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:
«Esa noche, tras la enorme explosión, el Capitán Berenjena cayó al mar desde una gran altura. Inmovilizado por el dolor, mientras se hundía en aquellas frías aguas, sintió como si millones de agujas se le clavaran por todo el cuerpo y supo que aquel era el fin. No temía a la muerte, pues no era el final del camino, sino una puerta que se abría ahora ante él. Al otro lado le esperaba su padre y, con tan magnífica compañía, no tenía nada que temer. El silencio y la oscuridad del fondo del mar le transmitían mucha paz. Cerró los ojos y, poco a poco, su corazón dejó de latir»
«Todo comenzó unos días antes, cuando, al alba, la reina Lydia subió las escaleras de la torre más alta del palacio real. Desde allí, entre las almenas, vio partir a tres jinetes que cabalgaban al galope. Al llegar al cruce de la vega, cada uno de ellos tomó una dirección diferente y se alejaron por el horizonte.            La reina Lydia, muy triste, pensó:            —Cabalgad, mis queridos heraldos. Encontradlos y transmitidles el mensaje. El reino de Alegoría está en peligro y el destino de todos nosotros está ahora en vuestras manos.            Después, agarró fuertemente el colgante de su pecho y, mirando al cielo, dijo:            —Capitán Berenjena, ¿por qué no vienes a ayudarnos? —y se puso a llorar amargamente, para dar salida al inmenso dolor que sentía en su corazón»
¿Cómo?
Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 840€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Teniendo acceso a las galeradas de edición.
Recibiendo un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Si bien, también podrías ver tu nombre en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán como ayuda para sacar adelante esta primera edición de El Capitán Berenjena y los héroes de Alegoría que saldría después a la venta.
Además...
Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogger, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y José Miguel Moras vea publicada su obra.

<h3>About the Book</h3>
In their first book, siblings Abby and Jamie uncovered a long-lost treasure and earned themselves the title of ""The Delaware Detectives.""  Now, the brother and sister are back, and they've been charged with the task of finding a missing person.  Utilizing every tool at their disposal, including their newfound teamwork, Abby and Jamie work hard to find and decipher the clues, but the trail doesn't lead where they expect, and before long, the siblings despair of ever solving the mystery.</div>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
My name is Dana Rongione, and I am the author of four Christian Living titles, three children's books and two self-help titles.  Additionally, I have written hundreds of articles and devotionals and am the creator and author of three blogs.  Before becoming a writer, I spent nine years as a teacher of kindergarten and lower elementary.  In addition to my writing, I currently teach a few Elementary Education classes at a local Bible college as well as the ladies' Sunday School class at my church, Bible Baptist Church in Pickens, SC.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On a more personal note, I am a chocoholic and a worry wart.  I love to read and to learn new things.  I enjoy hiking with my husband of 16 years and our two dogs.  I also have a great appreciation for music and try to express that appreciation by implementing my skills at the piano.</div>

<h3><strong>Why Am I Writing This Book?</strong></h3>
<div>As an avid reader, it didn't take me long to notice a gap in good literature for children between the ages of 8 and 14.  Many of the works that are available are either goofy and lack any real plot (i.e. they are ""dumbed down"") or are filled with negative aspects such as foul language, violence, disrespect and other poor behavior.  When I decided to write the first Delaware Detectives novel, I wanted to fill that literary void with a book that would engage middle-grade readers while instilling a peace of mind in their parents about their child's choice of reading material.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the end of the first novel, I left the story open to the possibility of a sequel, but to be honest, I had little intention of creating a mystery series.  However, the success of the first novel and the subsequent requests for a sequel caused me to re-evaluate my plans.  And that, my friends, is where you come in.  I'm ready to write the next book, but I need your help.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>How Far Along Are You?</h3>
I have recently finished my fifth Christian Living book and am now ready to turn my full attention to this second book in The Delaware Detectives series.  The book has been plotted and researched, but I have not yet written a word.  I hope to spend the next few months writing and re-writing this compelling story that is bound to have readers on the edge of their seats.  My goal is to have the book finished and available for purchase by the end of the year, but only the Lord knows what the future holds and whether or not I'll be able to meet that deadline.  Still, I plan to give it my all!</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why Do You Need Money?</h3>
To <em>write</em> a book, all I need is my computer, a word-processing program, time and a few energy drinks here and there. . . oh, and chocolate.  To <em>publish</em> a book, on the other hand, can get very expensive.  First, I need to hire an editor to make sure the book is error free and doesn't possess logic gaps and plot holes.  Second, I need to hire an illustrator for the interior drawings and the cover.  Third, I'll need to have the book formatted for paperback, ePub and Kindle.  Fourth, I need money to market the book once it's available, as well as to purchase copies of the book to take to book signings, workshops and the like.  As you can see, the cost adds up quickly, and that's why I'm asking for your help.  I promise you that every dime you donate will go toward the production and/or marketing of this book.  And if, by God's grace, I'm able to raise above and beyond my goal, the additional funds will allow me to take the research trip I long to take to Delaware to make sure all my facts are accurate and that I have a firsthand view of the layout of the land for a very special scene toward the end of the story.  You can help make this possible!</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>What If I Can't Afford to Donate?</strong></h3>
<p>I understand that some of you may not be able to help financially.  That's fine.  Times are hard, and I truly understand that.  We've searched through the couch cushions for spare change a few times ourselves.  But if you can't afford to give anything, would you please consider helping in one of these other ways:</p>
<p><strong>Pray for me</strong> - Your prayers mean the world to me, and they may mean the difference between failure and success in this campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Spread the word</strong> - You have friends, and they have friends.  Will you help spread the word about this campaign and the book I'm writing?  Tell the guys at work.  Mention it to the kids at school.  Paste a link or two on your favorite social media platform.  Please just help me get the word out.  Indiegogo has some awesome share tools you can use to making sharing that much easier.</p>

<h3>What Do I Get Out of All This?</h3>
<p><br/>First off, you get the knowledge that you are taking part in providing good literature for boys and girls who deserve to have something worth reading.  Second, I am offering a variety of gifts at different donation levels.  To see a detailed listing, view the ""Perks"" section to the right.  All donors will have their names listed in the acknowledgment section of the book.</p></div>","About the Book

<h1> </h1>
<h1>What is it?</h1>
<p>""Sayings of a Wise Man"" is a collection of life sayings and explanations that brings a new, honest, funny, and raw take on various subjects ranging from religion to success to relationships and just general life and wisdom.  Every saying, from proverbs to guidelines, are layered (meanning they have more than one meaning), and this has been designed and written with psychology in mind to inspire people to think and develop a different perspective...</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>What's Different About It?</h1>
<p><strong>First</strong>, it is honest.  From the funny sayings to the ones more controversial, this book is honest and hard to argue with.  </p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, we say what others are afraid to.  This book hasn't really been edited so much as it's been organized.  The sayings were written, whenever they hit, then reorganized by subject (that's it - raw).  We hit people with the cold, hard truth, because ""Ignorance is always bliss, until we wish we knew the truth.""</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, we like to laugh! :-)  Some sayings are blatantly funny; some are subtle (wait 10 seconds, then crack a smile kind of humor).  This is loaded and layered with all brands of humor (witticism, satire, innuendo, wordplay, etc.).  A few examples are:  ""People may say, 'You're a trip...  Personally, I prefer 'vacation""  and  ""I relate the truth to great sex...  sometimes it hurts.""</p>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, these sayings are hard to argue with.  Some may not win us any friends, but they're honest and accurate (to anyone who does their research or puts any serious thought in).</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>What Do You Get?</h1>
<p>First and foremost, you'll feel better!  Followed by the satisfaction that you helped bring knowledge and wisdom to the masses (we're being optimists here...  they have to pick up a book first).</p>
<p>Second, you will get an e-mail copy of the eBook, including illustrations.</p>
<p>You will also gain access to the sayings we knew would cause some havoc (we're edgy; however, we're not suicidal).  If you donate high enough, you will also be offered the opportunity of sending us a ""Your Review"" (up to 30 words) and finding your name under the list of contributors (we say ""offer"", because some people aren't bold enough to have their name in this book... but we can always see about adding it later, if you like :-).  </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Risks &amp; Challenges</h1>
<p>The greatest challenge for any author is people.  The goal for authors is to gain enough popularity for a publisher to want to pick up their book and put it on bookshelves, after which the author needs to maintain the momentum with interviews, radio shows, and online SEO and marketing, including social media.  We have a team with a strategy to overcome all of these obstacles, but we need capital to pull it off.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Even though the new Acclaimed Apocalypse edition of Love Beyond Life was ready on December 21st, 2012, I thought it would be a great idea to pair it with a brand new AVA-themed Valentine's Day card and Written in the Stars t-shirt, and release all of this 3 weeks before Valentine's Day, letting people get the perfect gift for their boyfriend, girlfriend, fiance, spouse, dog, what have you. Anyone who loves AVA and Love Beyond Life will surely treasure this unique Valentine's Day gift, and the greeting card with an AVA themed poem that ends with the line ""I love you beyond life"" will surely win you over in their hearts. Don't miss out!</p>
<p>Also, this campaign will feature the release of our new Call to Arms / Love Beyond Life themed zip hoodie. Perfect for this chilly winter weather and the on-coming spring season!</p>
<p>Most of you know me, the author Jeffrey A Brown through the facebook page, but if by the grace of God you just happen to have stumbled upon this campaign, allow me to introduce myself and my work. I wrote Love Beyond Life, a novel, as my honor's thesis to graduate from UMass Dartmouth. It was my attempt to blend the fields of Psychology and Quantum Physics in a universe of adventure, exploration and excitement that takes you along a reality-shifting journey, all the while plugging my research into the narrative to make the read both an enjoyable time and enriching, learning experience as well.</p>
<p>Since Love Beyond Life involves the 2012 Apocalypse, I decided to make a special Apocalypse edition. We call this the Acclaimed Apocalypse edition because it features commentary and reveiws from people all over the world. Also, now that Love Beyond Life is a 4 part novel series, this new edition of book one features an all new excerpt in the back of Love Beyond Life book two, which will not be available until 2014. That's more than 10 pages of all new content!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am using this campaign for several purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to get a bulk order of new edition books placed</li>
<li>feature special Valentine's Day packages</li>
<li>introduce the new Call to Arms themed zip-hoodie</li>
<li>give you the chance to get hard to find, out of production Merch as well!</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of perks listed below, as well as a graph to help you decide which package is best for you. The goal is to get $777, mostly because that is a cool number, but also because it will get a lot of books out there and produced as well. If, in the sad event, we do not reach $777, you will still get what you pledge for, as a lot of bulk orders are customizable. However, in all honestly I hope we go above and beyond $777. With your help, this can be possible!</p>
<p>See this chart to help you find which package is best for you:</p>

<h3> Shipping</h3>
<p>Please be aware that perk prices do not include shipping. To make sure that no one overpays for shipping, we will be doing shipping charges as a separate transaction when your package is bundled, weighed in exact amount and ready to go out to you. Everything will be shipping from Rhode Island, but international shipping is still possible. If you would like to know what you are looking at for shipping to your area before pledging, please just message me, either through here or on the facebook Love Beyond Life page, what package you would like and where you are located. I will get an estimate cost out to you so you can know what to expect before pledging. Thanks! </p>

<h3>
<br/>The Impact</h3>
<p>This book, and these items, will have a great impact on the world. As you will tell by reading the commentary from various readers throughout the world in the opening pages, this book has a tremendous impact and changes lives forever on after reading.</p>

Perk spotlight: What is the Love Beyond Life soundtrack? http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTbhoOlUmi0&noredirect=1     * the Love Beyond Life soundtrack goes for FREE to the first 10 pledgers, no matter what package they select
Perk spotlight: Valentine's Day card http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9dEagjsayU&feature=youtu.be
 
Short Summary
Even though the new Acclaimed Apocalypse edition of Love Beyond Life was ready on December 21st, 2012, I thought it would be a great idea to pair it with a brand new AVA-themed Valentine's Day card and Written in the Stars t-shirt, and release all of this 3 weeks before Valentine's Day, letting people get the perfect gift for their boyfriend, girlfriend, fiance, spouse, dog, what have you. Anyone who loves AVA and Love Beyond Life will surely treasure this unique Valentine's Day gift, and the greeting card with an AVA themed poem that ends with the line ""I love you beyond life"" will surely win you over in their hearts. Don't miss out!
Also, this campaign will feature the release of our new Call to Arms / Love Beyond Life themed zip hoodie. Perfect for this chilly winter weather and the on-coming spring season!
Most of you know me, the author Jeffrey A Brown through the facebook page, but if by the grace of God you just happen to have stumbled upon this campaign, allow me to introduce myself and my work. I wrote Love Beyond Life, a novel, as my honor's thesis to graduate from UMass Dartmouth. It was my attempt to blend the fields of Psychology and Quantum Physics in a universe of adventure, exploration and excitement that takes you along a reality-shifting journey, all the while plugging my research into the narrative to make the read both an enjoyable time and enriching, learning experience as well.
Since Love Beyond Life involves the 2012 Apocalypse, I decided to make a special Apocalypse edition. We call this the Acclaimed Apocalypse edition because it features commentary and reveiws from people all over the world. Also, now that Love Beyond Life is a 4 part novel series, this new edition of book one features an all new excerpt in the back of Love Beyond Life book two, which will not be available until 2014. That's more than 10 pages of all new content!
 


What We Need & What You Get
I am using this campaign for several purposes:

to get a bulk order of new edition books placed
feature special Valentine's Day packages
introduce the new Call to Arms themed zip-hoodie
give you the chance to get hard to find, out of production Merch as well!

There are a lot of perks listed below, as well as a graph to help you decide which package is best for you. The goal is to get $777, mostly because that is a cool number, but also because it will get a lot of books out there and produced as well. If, in the sad event, we do not reach $777, you will still get what you pledge for, as a lot of bulk orders are customizable. However, in all honestly I hope we go above and beyond $777. With your help, this can be possible!
See this chart to help you find which package is best for you:



 
 Shipping
Please be aware that perk prices do not include shipping. To make sure that no one overpays for shipping, we will be doing shipping charges as a separate transaction when your package is bundled, weighed in exact amount and ready to go out to you. Everything will be shipping from Rhode Island, but international shipping is still possible. If you would like to know what you are looking at for shipping to your area before pledging, please just message me, either through here or on the facebook Love Beyond Life page, what package you would like and where you are located. I will get an estimate cost out to you so you can know what to expect before pledging. Thanks! 
 

The Impact
This book, and these items, will have a great impact on the world. As you will tell by reading the commentary from various readers throughout the world in the opening pages, this book has a tremendous impact and changes lives forever on after reading.

<h3><b>My book was written primarily for three reasons:</b></h3>
<p>a. I have terminal cancer and need better insurance-I also need an income to carry me through the rough times</p>
<p>b. My share of the profits from the book upon my demise will be set up in a Trust for the College Education for my four grandsons (that has already been created by Steve Carvel, Esq.)</p>
<p>c. Percentages of my book will be allocated to the character Angela and some friends who have basically assisted me in business and provided supportive friendships during my lifetime</p>
<b><h3>Lady On Top</h3></b><p>My book, entitled “Lady on Top” is an unapologetic
perspective into the transitioning world from innocence, prostitution, high end
call girl and finally a highly reputed Madam in Las Vegas. The story is a
glimpse into the world of Angela and the motivation that propels her into the
world of prostitution, drugs, and murder. The character Angela is a composite
character based on a Madam who has been my client and friend for over twenty
years. You watch her travel from anonymity to being renowned in her society.
You feel her agony, ambition, and fiery passion reserved for her family.
Angela, like all prostitutes, did not wake up in the morning at 4 years old and
decide to become the most sought after Madame/Call Girl in Vegas for 20 plus
years. It was an evolution of self, in response to abuse, exploitation, and
rape. Yet she survived, proud and unashamed of the path she chose. It was a
response and a choice to end the ongoing misery of being powerless in her
world.</p>
<p>The real Angela catered to the Hollywood Elite,
Politicians, a President, and CEO’s, from all over the world. There is an EU
rating system and she was at the top. One might ponder the question, “what
sequence of events would project beautiful and talented women into this role?”
This book removes the veil. Due to my friendship with the character Angela, I
have had many clients who were prostitutes. Our relationship provided me with a
great deal of insight which I am sharing with you, the reader. I will say, I
cared about all of them. In their own ways they were quite fragile. If you
consider the trepidation and timidity that most women experience in their first
encounter with their lovers, you will appreciate that they have to numb
themselves or have become numb through life experiences to be capable of this
service in the nude.</p>
<h3>Self motivation propelled my proactive approach to my dilemma </h3>
<p>My reason for pursuing the avenue of crowdfunding is that
I believed I had a reliable publisher and her company bankrupted. I do not have
time to start over seeking a publisher, literary agent, and wait. My time is
limited as well as my choices. This is not a story about cancer, nor is it a
story about me. It is a vehicle which I knew would be marketable and sustain
me, as well as serve a greater purpose for my grandsons. </p>
<h3>Do I lay down and die or stand up and finish the race running?</h3>
<p>This book depicts the tenacity of a relentless spirit. The commonality, between the character Angela and I, is a dogged determination to survive. She rose above the shackles of victimization and I above the cancer. We both ran our race to the end…Like the character
Angela, I have made a choice to be proactive on my journey and do the best I
can to be self-sustaining.</p>
<p>Again, any income generated from this website will be
utilized to sustain me in my effort to self-market, self –publish, and document
my journey as I interface with my readers across the country. I will need to
update my Hyundai Sonata, a videographer, and funds for the process because I
am driving from Los Angeles all the way to New York, Florida and Washington. I
am on a mission to make this work. For any contributor of $5,000 or more, I
will personally drive to your city, at my expense. I will take you to dinner
and have a book signing for your friends. The book has been completed. The
objective on this site is to support publishing, marketing, and documentation.</p>
<h3>Life is about taking a bushel of lemons and making the best lemonade</h3>
<p>In conclusion, I am willing to prove to any interested
party, that there is indeed a book and I am terminal. I have managed to survive
without chemotherapy and radiation, by utilizing a holistic approach to my
illness, a regimen that I have designed. My oncologist recently told me that
she never believed I would survive after the surgery without chemo for more
than six months. It has been 2 ½ years. She calls me her miracle patient. Like
I said, I am on a mission! Thank you for your interest!</p>

<p>Help us make a full-color pre-school book that children gravitate to read about making new friends; in addition, each page teaches them a real-life lesson in playing safely. Our kids play at their own risk, but we can help alleviate unnecessary injuries by giving them examples through full-color illustrations they can see for themselves.  We are all protectors of children.  How far would you go to protect your toddler?  See how one Chinese father leaps out of a moving car to save his daughter: <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/kju6v42"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/kju6v42</a>  Could an illustrated child’s book teaching the child not to travel from the back seat to the front while the car is in motion have helped to prevent this accident?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Why:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This proposed project came about due to my observation and study of pre-schooler’s injuries while playing.  Initially I felt like writing a fun book with lots of smiles and good times and then it occurred to me how many children when playing get hurt so I began to see that I wanted to present a colorful fun book that taught young children about being safe while playing.  Why shouldn’t children have fun and at the same time learn how to prevent injuries?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In just four areas, drowning, falls, impact and bites there are thousands injured each year.  The CDC, Center for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a 2008 estimate of nonfatal injuries treated in emergency rooms, an estimated 878,000 children between ages 1 and 4 were admitted as a result of falling.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Impact injuries occur by a child being struck by something or having a disagreement with another child.  Over 371,000 children were admitted in 2008 due to impact injuries.  This book depicts children playing with one another, learning that friends have fun sharing toys not using them as a weapon to hit.  Another example is drowning.  Children can have fun with friends but in this colorful book they’ll actually see their friends wearing safety jackets around water and never going into the water without an adult around.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Is The Book About?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘Making Friends Is Fun – Play and Be Safe’ shows the children in the book addressing each other on how to be safe, rather than hearing it from their parents or another adult.  This way, the parent can read the book to the child and not be the bad guy, giving orders on staying away from bee hives and not playing too close to the fire pit.  Children love to learn from other children as well as discover things on their own.  They like to see and do what other children do.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Like all picture books ‘Making Friends Is Fun-Play and Be Safe’ is meant to be read to a child and give the adult reader the opportunity to fill in as much detail as you would like about staying safe while having fun.  So as a parent you and your child or grandchild can enjoy this book together and you know they are getting more than just fun from the read.  They’ll want to read it over and over again and each time building the safety concept in their little minds.  You will experience them sharing this book with other children and explaining to them what they learned about being safe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Me?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Can I produce this, am I capable?  Yes.  The text is almost complete.  I majored in Child Psychology and Child Development in college, but more than that I’m a certified life coach with many years of mentoring and coaching behind me.  So, I’m one who believes experience plus wisdom and common sense is the best teacher, not just book knowledge.  I’ve worked with young children, young adults as well as coached individuals and groups for over 25 years.  In a couple of bonuses check out the coaching reward I’ve included for your child or a child of your choice.  I’ve authored two eBooks, but this project must be more than an eBook, children need to place this in their hands and turn the pages and feel the words as well as see them.  Simply because the message contained within the pages is a universal one.  It’s an awareness journey driven by the passion that unites us all; love, commitment, and protection along with adventure.  It’s about safety and comfort and it’s about the greatest gift of all, our children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m a writer at heart and second I’m an advocate for what’s right; but this is more than just a book.  I could take the easy route and just leave it as an eBook, but how many children would see it, read it, experience it?  Let me level with you.  My children are grown.  My grandchildren are too.  This isn’t about me, this book is about your children and your grandchildren and all those children out there who are going to read the books.  Why not give them one that lights up their face as well as keep them safer?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m going down the harder and more rewarding route.  I’m taking a raw manuscript through the various stages of editing, design, illustration and development or publishing. But I don’t want to do it alone.  Insider access and input is important to me and this project.  Even though the format of the book has been decided, I am open to additional feedback so share your child activity/safety scenarios with me and let’s do this project for the little ones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing, I don’t believe we’re limited to reaching children with just one model of service. We believe adding a one-on-one personal coaching model means we can, together, reach more children, including troubled, abused and bullied little ones. We have then an opportunity to build their self-esteem while eliminating old patterns of verbal and/or physical destruction.  This is why I’ve added the personal coaching reward to a couple of tiers because I feel your child can add his or her strength to this book with their own words of encouragement.  Who knows which child will eventually read this book and gain strength and purpose because your child dropped a nugget of truth for another child in the pages reserved for these important thoughts?   </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>People are busy mainly in 3 areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Living their lives</li>
<li>Investing time in their families</li>
<li>Contributing to society</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The challenge is getting this book on paper and in the hands of as many children as possible.  Indiegogo is our way to organize the contributors who also feel this book will benefit the young children who play daily somewhere and need to incorporate safety with fun.  Indiegogo is a way for us to take hands together and contribute to society while benefiting your own family with rewards at the same time.  Indiegogo coordinates and it amplifies.  Partner with us to get this project out and when we do, our children prosper as well as our neighbors children.   I am so incredibly grateful for you.

<p><strong>What We Will Do With the Funds:</strong></p>
<p>If we meet our goal, we will cover all the basic expenses to get this book out: If we go over the goal we will begin Series 2 and do our best to continue each series up to 5 safety books.</p>
<p>·Book Layout and Cover Design – Mickey Root</p>
<p>·Illustrator- I’ve used 3 illustrators/  we’re  hoping for a 24 page illustrated book</p>
<p>·Editor-</p>

<p>·Publisher–Susan David through Amazon</p>
<p>·Printer– Create Space does soft-cover books, standard color</p>
<p>Business filings:</p>
<p>·Updating the website- to include the new children's book + videos</p>
<p>·eBooks– we will send gift copies</p>
<p>·CD’s (audio of the entire book, including the children’s voices of higher tiers) Susan will narrate the entire book- CD's and CD covers vary in cost. We will go with standard pricing.</p>
<p>·T-shirts– printed by <a href=""http://Vistaprint.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Vistaprint.com</a> and/or other online artist</p>
<p>·Shipping charges- vary depending on weight and size</p>
<p><strong>SPECIAL NOTE:</strong>  Quite frankly with everything we need to cover it may take more than the $6000 we’re asking in the Indiegogo goal.   We’re trying to be realistic and at the same time not exaggerate.  One thought that is exciting is, if we go over the goal, the more the better because the funds available can now be used to produce the second volume, Series 2 of the fun and safety read for young children.  Our long-term goal of course is to see a series of 3-5 books available since there is much to cover in illustrating this need.  Fund raising and outreach will help secure the long-term viability of the project and that aspect always consumes more money. Remember, the more safety children’s books we can get out with numerous illustrations the greater picture we create in the minds of our children toward a safer environment.  So, know that the desire of this project is to over-fund in order to accomplish just that.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we reach our goal we will certainly have a lot of packages to send to you.   The greatest challenge would be to get the illustrator to deliver the rest of the illustrations in a timely manner.  I do have a commitment and we are on schedule thus far with several illustrations delivered. J The text itself has been completed and ready for editing. So this is looking good!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With respect to rewards fulfillment, we will be working with professional fulfillment partners such as Create Space for the printed book copies; they are owned by Amazon and their children’s books are of high quality.  A T-shirt and CD company and for the digital downloads.  I will personally email to gather T-shirt sizes and schedule all coaching sessions to coordinate with your schedule so your time slot is convenient and timely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ll be sending regular updates about our progress to all backers, so you’ll be the first to know about what’s going on.  We will make sure all rewards are delivered safely and on schedule.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Important Information About Rewards:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Distribution schedule is not finalized; once we’re funded I will keep all backers in the loop about the book and the rewards, we promise to keep you posted by email and will work diligently to see that all rewards are delivered as soon as we can after the close of the project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The End Result:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The end result of this adventure will be creating and featuring a fun time for young children through a reading experience that will give us safer kids as they engage. We are not limited to reaching children with just one model of service, that’s why we’ve added a one-on-one personal coaching model to some of our rewards.  This means we can, together, reach more children, including troubled, abused and bullied little ones.  We have then an opportunity to build their self-esteem while eliminating old patterns of verbal and/or physical destruction.   How many children would you like to reach?  Anything you can kick-in helps make this happen. Yes, we need the money, but we also need your energy and enthusiasm, your thoughts and ideas.  Help us get this out and known by posting this campaign on Facebook and Twitter as well as to your email list.  We promise you this: every dollar you give us will be put to work crafting a unique children’s book you’ll be proud you were a part of.  Thank you for making it happen and for spreading the word.  Please check out the awesome rewards we have for you as our thank you.</p>

‘Making Friends Is Fun – Play and Be Safe’ shows the children in the book addressing each other on how to be safe, rather than hearing it from their parents or another adult.  This way, the parent can read the book to the child and not be the bad guy, giving orders on staying away from bee hives and not playing too close to the fire pit.  Children love to learn from other children as well as discover things on their own.  They like to see and do what other children do.
 
Like all picture books ‘Making Friends Is Fun-Play and Be Safe’ is meant to be read to a child and give the adult reader the opportunity to fill in as much detail as you would like about staying safe while having fun.  So as a parent you and your child or grandchild can enjoy this book together and you know they are getting more than just fun from the read.  They’ll want to read it over and over again and each time building the safety concept in their little minds.  You will experience them sharing this book with other children and explaining to them what they learned about being safe.
 
Why Me?
 
Can I produce this, am I capable?  Yes.  The text is almost complete.  I majored in Child Psychology and Child Development in college, but more than that I’m a certified life coach with many years of mentoring and coaching behind me.  So, I’m one who believes experience plus wisdom and common sense is the best teacher, not just book knowledge.  I’ve worked with young children, young adults as well as coached individuals and groups for over 25 years.  In a couple of bonuses check out the coaching reward I’ve included for your child or a child of your choice.  I’ve authored two eBooks, but this project must be more than an eBook, children need to place this in their hands and turn the pages and feel the words as well as see them.  Simply because the message contained within the pages is a universal one.  It’s an awareness journey driven by the passion that unites us all; love, commitment, and protection along with adventure.  It’s about safety and comfort and it’s about the greatest gift of all, our children.
 
I’m a writer at heart and second I’m an advocate for what’s right; but this is more than just a book.  I could take the easy route and just leave it as an eBook, but how many children would see it, read it, experience it?  Let me level with you.  My children are grown.  My grandchildren are too.  This isn’t about me, this book is about your children and your grandchildren and all those children out there who are going to read the books.  Why not give them one that lights up their face as well as keep them safer?
 
I’m going down the harder and more rewarding route.  I’m taking a raw manuscript through the various stages of editing, design, illustration and development or publishing. But I don’t want to do it alone.  Insider access and input is important to me and this project.  Even though the format of the book has been decided, I am open to additional feedback so share your child activity/safety scenarios with me and let’s do this project for the little ones.
 
Oh, and one more thing, I don’t believe we’re limited to reaching children with just one model of service. We believe adding a one-on-one personal coaching model means we can, together, reach more children, including troubled, abused and bullied little ones. We have then an opportunity to build their self-esteem while eliminating old patterns of verbal and/or physical destruction.  This is why I’ve added the personal coaching reward to a couple of tiers because I feel your child can add his or her strength to this book with their own words of encouragement.  Who knows which child will eventually read this book and gain strength and purpose because your child dropped a nugget of truth for another child in the pages reserved for these important thoughts?   
 
Why Indiegogo?
 
People are busy mainly in 3 areas:

Living their lives
Investing time in their families
Contributing to society

 
The challenge is getting this book on paper and in the hands of as many children as possible.  Indiegogo is our way to organize the contributors who also feel this book will benefit the young children who play daily somewhere and need to incorporate safety with fun.  Indiegogo is a way for us to take hands together and contribute to society while benefiting your own family with rewards at the same time.  Indiegogo coordinates and it amplifies.  Partner with us to get this project out and when we do, our children prosper as well as our neighbors children.   I am so incredibly grateful for you. Every dollar you give will make this happen.
 
 
A Peek at Rewards :
 
The fun part of giving for me is to see contributors receiving rewards for their heartfelt partnership.  So we’ve compiled some rewards we feel will please you as well as your children. If you live outside the US/Canada please add $25 for shipping cost to your pledge, that would help us alot to get things to you. Thank you.

Rewards will begin at the lower level and receive an eBook copy of ‘Making Friends Is Fun-Play and Be Safe.’
 
Full Color soft-bound book:
 
We will send soft-cover books

The T-shirts will be full-color printed shirts with the ‘Making Friends Is Fun’ book cover illustration on the front. Your pre-schooler will love wearing this shirt to play or even to sleep in.

What We Will Do With the Funds:
If we meet our goal, we will cover all the basic expenses to get this book out: If we go over the goal we will begin Series 2 and do our best to continue each series up to 5 safety books.
·Book Layout and Cover Design – Mickey Root
·Illustrator- I’ve used 3 illustrators/  we’re  hoping for a 24 page illustrated book
·Editor-
- ISBN #'s -
·Publisher–Susan David through Amazon
·Printer– Create Space does soft-cover books, standard color
Business filings:
·Updating the website- to include the new children's book + videos
·eBooks– we will send gift copies
·CD’s (audio of the entire book, including the children’s voices of higher tiers) Susan will narrate the entire book- CD's and CD covers vary in cost. We will go with standard pricing.
·T-shirts– printed by Vistaprint.com and/or other online artist
·Shipping charges- vary depending on weight and size
SPECIAL NOTE:  Quite frankly with everything we need to cover it may take more than the $6000 we’re asking in the Indiegogo goal.   We’re trying to be realistic and at the same time not exaggerate.  One thought that is exciting is, if we go over the goal, the more the better because the funds available can now be used to produce the second volume, Series 2 of the fun and safety read for young children.  Our long-term goal of course is to see a series of 3-5 books available since there is much to cover in illustrating this need.  Fund raising and outreach will help secure the long-term viability of the project and that aspect always consumes more money. Remember, the more safety children’s books we can get out with numerous illustrations the greater picture we create in the minds of our children toward a safer environment.  So, know that the desire of this project is to over-fund in order to accomplish just that.  
 
Risks and Challenges:
 
If we reach our goal we will certainly have a lot of packages to send to you.   The greatest challenge would be to get the illustrator to deliver the rest of the illustrations in a timely manner.  I do have a commitment and we are on schedule thus far with several illustrations delivered. J The text itself has been completed and ready for editing. So this is looking good!
 
With respect to rewards fulfillment, we will be working with professional fulfillment partners such as Create Space for the printed book copies; they are owned by Amazon and their children’s books are of high quality.  A T-shirt and CD company and for the digital downloads.  I will personally email to gather T-shirt sizes and schedule all coaching sessions to coordinate with your schedule so your time slot is convenient and timely.
 
I’ll be sending regular updates about our progress to all backers, so you’ll be the first to know about what’s going on.  We will make sure all rewards are delivered safely and on schedule.
 
Important Information About Rewards:
 
Distribution schedule is not finalized; once we’re funded I will keep all backers in the loop about the book and the rewards, we promise to keep you posted by email and will work diligently to see that all rewards are delivered as soon as we can after the close of the project.
 
The End Result:
 
The end result of this adventure will be creating and featuring a fun time for young children through a reading experience that will give us safer kids as they engage. We are not limited to reaching children with just one model of service, that’s why we’ve added a one-on-one personal coaching model to some of our rewards.  This means we can, together, reach more children, including troubled, abused and bullied little ones.  We have then an opportunity to build their self-esteem while eliminating old patterns of verbal and/or physical destruction.   How many children would you like to reach?  Anything you can kick-in helps make this happen. Yes, we need the money, but we also need your energy and enthusiasm, your thoughts and ideas.  Help us get this out and known by posting this campaign on Facebook and Twitter as well as to your email list.  We promise you this: every dollar you give us will be put to work crafting a unique children’s book you’ll be proud you were a part of.  Thank you for making it happen and for spreading the word.  Please check out the awesome rewards we have for you as our thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We're still publishing the high-quality fantastic fiction you've come to expect under the Big Pulp banner, but now it will be easier to find your favorites! In March, we'll debut the first issue of Child of Words, our science fiction and fantasy magazine, featuring work by Michael Andre-Druissi; Betsy Dornbusch; Adele Gardner; Fi Mitchell; DeAnna Knippling; Charles Leggett; WC Roberts; Selina Rosen; Stephen Ross; Ian Smith; Bonnie Jo Stufflebeam; John F.D. Taff; and Neil Weston.Then in May, we'll have the premiere of M - the magazine of murder and the macabre, with work by Steve Passey; Helen Wurthman; Robert Laughlin; Shannon Schuren; Don Norum; Simon Perchik; Jake Walters; Ron Larson; Ellen Larson; Katrina Ray-Saulis; Stephen Rogers; Philip Roberts; and Wolf Hartman. Finally, in July, we'll turn up the heat with Thirst, our magazine of dark romance and obsession, featuring the passions of Virgina Aronson; Bruce Golden; Gerri Leen; Charles Leggett; Lyn Lifshin; Chris Longhurst;Jennifer Povey; Terrie Leigh Relf; Wayne Scheer; Karissa Sluss; Gene Stewart; J.S. Watts; and Nu Yang.Our second issues of Child of Words and M will follow in September and November, respectively, SF&F by Alexander Burns; Willis Couvillier; Mira Desai; Conda Douglas; Daniel Galef; Shane Gavin; Tony Haynes; Shaun McCoy; Robert Quinlivan; L.B. Sedlacek; and Clay Waters; and horror and mystery from John Bruni; David Hagerty; Terrie Leigh Relf; F.J. Bergmann; Joanna Weston; Dean Blanchard; Holly Day; Meghan Carter; James Reed; Brian Leopold; and Joseph Tomaras.Child of Words, M, and Thirst are published in magazine format (approx 7x10), with 48 pages of great fiction and poetry in each issue! About Big PulpFor five years, Big Pulp has been carving out an independent niche in the publishing world, where story matters and writers get paid for their work. Since we launched in 2008, we've dreamed of having enough different publications to fill an entire newsstand, and representing the widest possible selection of fiction, from SF and fantasy, to horror and mystery, true crime, jungle tales, super-heroes, romance, weird western, and on and on. In 2014, we're taking the next steps to making that dream a reality. Do you like stories? Got 10 or 20 or 40 bucks? You're halfway there! What it means to usWithout you, we're nothing. Without subscribers, Big Pulp is just a pile of books in a box. Without readers, our writers are…well, they're still writers, but I'm sure they'd agree it's a lot more fun with readers than without. Sales are our lifeline. Period. Every perk gets a magazine or a collection of publications. Every dollar goes to paying our writers and artists and printing the magazine.What We Need & What You Get$2000 buys a lot for a small press, including dozens of writer payments and a healthy print run for our magazines. All our editorial work - site maintenance, editing and proofreading, sales & events - is done pro bono. Every dollar raised through the campaign will go back into running the website, publishing the magazine, and paying contributors. No exceptions. Every perk has a publication attached! None of that ""eternal gratitude"" stuff, although we'll give you that, too. But our goal is to put a magazine or three into your hands. Stretch goals
If we make $4,000, every backer will receive a back issue of Big Pulp! 
If we make $6,000, we'll announce a new anthology for 2014 and open up submissions! 
If we make $10,000, we'll flee to Mexico…I mean…announce another big project or two…probably. From Mexico.

Intrinsically, photography captures and externalizes real moments—real people. you look back at old pictures your grandparents stored years and years ago, and you see nothing but the truest form of your ancestors; you look at the time you were first able to breathe and see, or the time your family first carried you in their arms; you see nothing but the most intimate forms of their emotions, whether it is happiness or sadness. I find nothing more magical than taking these moments, and these people, and transforming them into something that I feel. Just this very possibility, combining elements of reality with imagination, makes photography so magnetic. It is the part that allows us to look past what we have been told is our reality, and understand the reality our soul is truly living in. and this, is where my photographs come from, and hopefully reflect one day.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><strong>Before you decide to donate to my project please let me explain my reason for reaching out on indiegogo. </strong>First, before you lay down any of your hard earned cash, I want you to know I have invested over $10,000 thousand dollars of my own money into my project. I have spent hundreds of hours writing draft after draft of my manuscript over the last six months. I hired a self-publishing firm at significant cost. I hired a graphic designer to make my Book cover. I have hired a professional editor to go over my work for two more re-writes. I have attended an expensive seminar to learn about book publicity and book promotion. These are just a few of the major expenses I have incurred in the creation this project. I have chosen to spend all the funds I have including going into dreaded credit card debt to make this project come to life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am dedicating my life to saving other lives from the kind of heart-break and sorrow I experienced becoming an alcoholic at age 19 and age 23 when I hit bottom and found myself in AA. If I can save one young person from going down the path I took it will all be worth it. I was quarterback of the football team, I was an A student, but the use and abuse - drinking alcohol and doing some drugs turned me into a full-time alcoholic by age 19. I would like to help other teens and colege age young people from making the same mistake. <strong>I hope to save a life. All funds will go to helping me finish the book and promoting the it through the proper publicity channels.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h2><strong>SIX reasons your donation is so important:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>You will be the reason why my story reaches that one young person living on the edge and saves a life. </strong></li>
<li><strong>You will be part of fostering greater awareness regarding the perils of teenage and college age drinking.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You will be the reason my story will make a social difference in the lives of young people starting to use alcohol. </strong></li>
<li><strong>You will be facilitating the promotion of my book through publicity channels so my story reaches those who need it most.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You will be securing me the time I need to focus on perfecting the final draft of my story. </strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I am writing my story because it is my most sincere hope that my story will save one life. That will make it all worth it. I am aware this maybe a grandiose desire for an indie writer. But I believe my story is powerful and dramatic. I have been working on this book at the expense of my family, my children, my wife, possibly my marriage and my personal finances. To make the attempt at writing a book that will make a social difference in the lives of other people has a financial cost much greater than I had estimated. As I near the finish-line, I do not want financial issues to compromise my book being publicized professionally. I believe deeply in the importance of my story as a warning and as an example. I believe my story will effect the lives of young people, high school and college age. And the book is for parents who may not be aware of the real-life dangers that alcohol that poses to the lives of their children. My story also offers hope to those suffering alcoholics who are trying hard to get sober and all the family members that live with an alcoholic in their life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Autors note : </strong><strong> </strong><em><strong>I am not being dramatic when I say that Alcoholism is a Life and Death issue. I have buried loved ones to the disease of Alcoholism and if you are still reading, chances are you have too. I will be forever grateful for your support.</strong></em></p>

I am dedicating my life to saving other lives from the kind of heart-break and sorrow I experienced becoming an alcoholic at age 19 and age 23 when I hit bottom and found myself in AA. If I can save one young person from going down the path I took it will all be worth it. I was quarterback of the football team, I was an A student, but the use and abuse - drinking alcohol and doing some drugs turned me into a full-time alcoholic by age 19. I would like to help other teens and colege age young people from making the same mistake. I hope to save a life. All funds will go to helping me finish the book and promoting the it through the proper publicity channels.


What We Need & What You Get
SIX reasons your donation is so important:

You will be the reason why my story reaches that one young person living on the edge and saves a life. 
You will be part of fostering greater awareness regarding the perils of teenage and college age drinking.
You will be the reason my story will make a social difference in the lives of young people starting to use alcohol. 
You will be facilitating the promotion of my book through publicity channels so my story reaches those who need it most.
You will be securing me the time I need to focus on perfecting the final draft of my story. 

 
I am writing my story because it is my most sincere hope that my story will save one life. That will make it all worth it. I am aware this maybe a grandiose desire for an indie writer. But I believe my story is powerful and dramatic. I have been working on this book at the expense of my family, my children, my wife, possibly my marriage and my personal finances. To make the attempt at writing a book that will make a social difference in the lives of other people has a financial cost much greater than I had estimated. As I near the finish-line, I do not want financial issues to compromise my book being publicized professionally. I believe deeply in the importance of my story as a warning and as an example. I believe my story will effect the lives of young people, high school and college age. And the book is for parents who may not be aware of the real-life dangers that alcohol that poses to the lives of their children. My story also offers hope to those suffering alcoholics who are trying hard to get sober and all the family members that live with an alcoholic in their life.
 
Autors note :  I am not being dramatic when I say that Alcoholism is a Life and Death issue. I have buried loved ones to the disease of Alcoholism and if you are still reading, chances are you have too. I will be forever grateful for your support.

<p>Alafia (Peace) I am Khafre K. Abif, AIDS Activist and I have been thriving with HIV for 23 years. I have compiled an anthology of inspirational prayers, poems and affirmations to support the souls and uplift the spirits of People Living with HIV/AIDS. For the last eighteen month the submissions have touched my soul, made me cry, filled me with hope, and connected me to an international community of compassionate contributors who have shared their work to empower my world. <strong><em>Your Sponsorship will bring a healing word to those who are infected and affected by HIV/AIDS.</em></strong></p>
<p>I believe that there is healing in prayer. I know that words have power. I needed to provide this collection of words that will combat the words that are so often hear spoken to someone with HIV. This is my effort to help combat HIV-related stigma. AIDS-related stigma and discrimination refers to prejudice, negative attitudes, abuse and maltreatment directed at people living with HIV and AIDS. The consequences of stigma and discrimination are wide-ranging: being shunned by family, peers and the wider community, poor treatment in healthcare and education settings, an erosion of rights, psychological damage, and a negative effect on the success of HIV testing and treatment. The idea for the anthology grew out of my work as an HIV Test Counselor. Each time I had to share with someone that they tested positive for HIV one of the first issues for them was disclosure.</p>
<p><strong><em>Cornbread, Fish and Collard Greens: Prayers, Poems &amp; Affirmation for People Living with HIV/AIDS</em></strong> has received submission from Africa, America, Europe, and South America. Contributors have provided their work in their indigenous language with an English translation. I want to shares this anthology with the international community who created it. As you are reading this it is quite possible that you know someone living with HIV/AIDS. If you do then they have shared their status with you. Let us consider all of those who still haven’t disclosed to their mother, father, sister/brother or even their faith community. What place to they go to as a source of support and inspiration?</p>
<p>Poets featured in the forthcoming anthology include: <strong>Nikki Grimes, Serena T. Wills, Reginald T. Jackson, Sharaledon D. Brave, r. witherspoon, Samiya Bashir, Storme Webber, Carl Hancock Rux, Tim’m T. West, Mose Xavier Hardin, Jr., Lady Vee DaPoet, Victor R. Pond, Catherine Zickgraf, Temujin Ekunfeo, Alfreda Lanoix. Maria Hiv Mejia, Tony Medina, Sandy Rodgers, W. Travis Wright, Vanessa German, Mary Bowman and avery r. young and more.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stigma</strong> is a three-dollar word that affects millions of Americans in different ways. Defining stigma as simply ""a mark of shame or discredit"" doesn't sound very impactful, and yet communities around the globe are paralyzed by it every day. I know this firsthand because I am HIV-positive. I have personally experienced the ignorance and discrimination faced by those of us who live with HIV.</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS stigma is rampant in American society. It started in the 1980s when the disease was termed GRID (Gay Related Immune Deficiency); President Reagan refused to even say the word AIDS for four years and the epidemic decimated entire communities in this country all the while. There is not one person living with HIV that I know of who has not suffered at some point due to stigma. In my case, due to my chosen profession, as a children’s librarian, stigma kept me silent for almost 15years.</p>
<p>The information about how to guard against HIV is out there, but people aren't educated, or don't think that they are at risk. People aren't getting tested (or even treated if they test positive) because they are afraid of the consequences of their loved ones finding out they are HIV-positive. Ignorance begets ignorance, and the silence of those of us who know better hinders the cause: we need to speak up.</p>
<p>We cannot end the AIDS epidemic without fighting the stigma, silence and fear associated with it. Your sponsorship for this campaign and its successful publishing will to the tool box of the infected community as each take a daily read to arm themselves before leaving their home and entering into a world that <strong>STILL hold stigma, shame and silence for the lives WE live each day.</strong></p>

<p>HULL DAMAGE is a spacepunk crime caper about a daredevil pirate captain and his crew of interstellar buccaneers who find themselves caught in the crossfire of a bidding war between three of the galaxy's most ruthless and powerful crime lords.</p>
<p>Earning a decent living as an interstellar pirate has never exactly been easy, especially not in rough-and-tumble Bad Space, the lawless region at the fringes of the civilized galaxy, where there's a fight in every bar, a gun on every belt and a chip on everyone's shoulder, but the crew of <em>The Unconstant Lover </em>has got it particularly raw. Contending daily with the mechanical failures of their haggard spaceship and the best efforts of bounty hunters to collect the growing price on their heads, this crew of cutthroats, buccaneers and scofflaws use wits, weapons and wisecracks to make off with as much booty as they can, with the forces of law and order never more than one step behind.</p>
<p>The only impediment between them and a quiet criminal career is their blowhard of a captain. Ace pilot, megalomaniac and hell-bent on becoming the most fearsome dread pirate this galaxy has ever seen, Captain Nemo leads his motley crew with bluster and bravado through planetary blockades, space station shootouts and a bidding war between three of the galaxy's preeminent gangsters and, when push comes to shove, they'll need every trick in the space pirate code to see it through to the other side.</p>
<p>Fans of Firefly, Star Wars and the works of Quentin Tarantino will find HULL DAMAGE to be a thrilling science fiction romp, blending the genres of space opera and crime comedy. If you like snappy dialogue, unscrupulous rogues, laser gun shoot-outs and perpetually malfunctioning spaceships, HULL DAMAGE should be just your brand of poison.</p>

<p>Greetings! </p>
<p>Im Jeff. Pretty much just a guy experiencing life in this world. Ive been through some great experiences, down to some pretty horrific stuff. Enough to learn that at the end of the day, the most important experiences are the ones Ive shared with living things.<br/></p>
<p>One day I looked around and realized I didnt have a sunset buddy for this really gorgeous sunset that was happening. Sometimes too, we get too busy to stop and make a sunset date. <br/></p>
<p>So I wrote the framework for Sunset Buddies right then and there, on every piece of paper I had with me, including dollar bills. </p>
<p>Sunset Buddies follows along as a young person looks for different ones to share a sunset, a sunset 'bucket list'. Family members, friends, neighbors, and definitely pets. (You'll notice on the cover is the dog, cat, bunny and Ralph from Good Midnight Stars), Mrs Butternut, Lisa Shufflekelp, Chen Tugabus, Taquina Bobina, Sandy Wigglesnort, Laura Thundermush, and Sam Tattoome, are just some of the people we meet.<br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Bottom Line? Your help to get these printed and into the hands of children. As a thank you for your contribution, we are going to put your name and your favorite Sunset Buddy on pages at the back of the book. So, when you contribute, please let me know who your SBF is (Sunset Buddy Forever) and we'll do the rest.<br/><br/>As a supplement to the Dreamland Explorers series, <i>Sunset Buddies</i> promotes the idea to make sunsets count, for the experiences with other beings. The main character is on a mission to have a sunset buddy as many days as possible. We are taken through a series of seasons, with each experience 4-6 pages long, which ends with turning the page to a two-page spread of a sunset, with our main character and that particular sunset buddy silhouetted against a sunset, as the front cover shows. <br/><br/>So each sunset illustration is one from an artist across the world, all contributed, sharing their concept of a sunset experience. I will then put the sunset in a best match with the sunset experience of the main character. <br/><br/>And like Dreamland Explorers series (Good Midnight Stars (here on indiegogo), Good Morning Sun, and Dreamland Explorers' Adventure Guide), I want to donate the books. Your funding provides the printing, delivery to children in hospitals, libraries with dedicated childrens' reading areas, and basically any child who would like a copy. The cost of printing one book is approximately 4.20/ea. Shipping takes the rest of the funds. For whatever we can raise- that is how many books will be available. Ive decided to use a printer in Germany so we do not have to worry about leadfree testing, which is fairly expensive. <br/><br/>I have secured volunteer translators in Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Ukrainian, and French. There are so many languages I want to offer: Chinese, Japanese, German, etc. <br/><br/>Then there is the website. I think we need to have a standalone website for Sunset Buddies, with a link to the dreamlandexplorers.com website. Im thinking there might be a need to expand Sunset Buddies to tackle other issues. Maybe just to send a 'share a sunset"" invitation. Or, breaking out one of the sunset experiences in the book where the reader (as the main character) finds a person in need, who is in emotional need of a friend to have a sunset with. (teaching to give as well as receive the time and love of others). Id also like to use the website to further develop the thought of the sunset buddy list (bucket list). An interactive platform for them to think about the people and animals in their life that may need their attention as well as the joy of being with that person. Maybe even a whole sunset buddies list or future book, starring mostly different dogs. Of course, a good website alone will take all of the funds requested. So, maybe just have to put that off for some time. <br/><br/>And if there are any funds to provide it, Im in desperate need of an updated wacom Cintiq large format, which is a pretty expensive unit, but has no equal and it will save on art production costs and time. <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Reinforcing the value of human relationships is something that I hope to reinforce with these stories of each sunset. By helping young ones to value that living contact, I hope that appreciation for life, and positive experiences, will stay with them for life. </p>
<p>One of the aspects of the book is the invitation that has gone out 
for artists from all over to contribute their sunset to the book. Some are known 
artists, others are not. Then the other illustrations needed I will fill
 in. The diversity of the various artists from all over the earth, I 
believe will help further the impact of the book.</p>
<p>By making it a downloadable pdf/ebook, I believe will also help to support a worldwide audience. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Certainly there are so many other ways to help. Make a sunset date today! Teach anyone around you to stop and share a sunset, especially younger ones. Please help us get the word out on this book campaign! There are sharing tools here, and just anything you can do to help.<br/></p>
<p>Above all, please make sure you have a sunset buddy as much as your life will allow. </p>
<p>If you are an artist and would like to submit your work, please do so at submissions@dreamtodesign.com. No photos, only original artwork by your own hand. <br/></p>
<p>We will contact you with the legal forms to release the work, but all artists will be thanked and credited in the book. If your work has a title, and I hope you care about it enough to do so, please make sure to include that, as it will be used in the workprint process. <br/></p>

<li>
<b>Short Story Writing</b> - author of the brilliant book, <i>Short Circuit: A guide to the art of the short story</i>, as well as several novels and short story collections, Vanessa Gebbie will be running the workshop at this retreat. The venue is a Grade II listed farmhouse in Surrey.</li>

I need to spread the word further! These funds will enable me to run adverts in the print editions and on the magazines' websites.</li>
<li>The other £1,890 goes towards the Indigogo fee and the running costs of the retreats - venues, catering and workshops. </li>
<li>The perks on offer include signed copies of the <i>Stories for Homes</i> anthology, which is raising money for housing and homeless charity, Shelter, and features one of my stories; a copy of the first anthology of winning stories from the Retreat West Short Story Competition (which is being published in March 2014); critiques of your own writing; 6 <span class=""GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"" id=""6c0d28d2-b974-4738-b17e-ac9830070bdd"">week</span> online creative writing courses for beginners; and places at the genre writing retreats.</li>

I ran my first residential retreats in 2013, one of which took place in a National Trust lighthouse cottage. Author, Alison Moore, whose debut novel <i>The Lighthouse</i> was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, ran a workshop at this retreat, which sold out several weeks before it took place. You can see what one of the writers who came on it thought about the retreat here: <a href=""http://jen-squire.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/we-all-need-lighthouse-of-our-own.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>We all need a lighthouse of our own</a></p><p>The feedback from other writers that came along was also excellent and Cath Barton said: ""The writing retreat was special in lots of ways, not least for having Alison Moore as workshop tutor.

I also work as a freelance features writer and in order to have more time to work on my novels, which I have an agent interested in, I am launching a series of writing retreats that will all take place in inspirational National Trust holiday cottages.  If I can raise the funds to help me promote and run these retreats, then I will be able to take on fewer freelance commissions and have the time to work on my fiction and hopefully get a book deal (my lifelong dream!). Other writers will also get the chance to work with leading authors in different genres to develop their writing and hopefully get book deals too. Meaning we all get more great books to read.The genre retreats that I'm running, which are the one's writers most wanted to go on in the survey they completed for me, are:

Crime/Thriller Writing - taking place in Agatha Christie's house in Devon with a workshop by Sophie Hannah, who will be taking her new Poirot novel on tour shortly after the retreat runs.

Short Story Writing - author of the brilliant book, Short Circuit: A guide to the art of the short story, as well as several novels and short story collections, Vanessa Gebbie will be running the workshop at this retreat. The venue is a Grade II listed farmhouse in Surrey.

Historical Fiction Writing - this retreat will take place in an amazing Victorian Carding Mill in the Lake District, with Emma Darwin, author of critically acclaimed bestselling historical novels, running the workshop.

Literary Fiction Writing - back by popular demand, Alison Moore will be hosting the workshop at this retreat in one of Devon's most impressive old manor houses.

Women's Fiction Writing - bestselling and award-winning author Rowan Coleman will teach writers how to write great Women's Fiction in a house in Cumbria that was built by a suffragette. 
What I Need & What You GetHere's what I'll do with the funds I raise and what you'll get if you can contribute:
I need £2,000 to run advertising campaigns in relevant media: The New Writer, Mslexia and Writing Magazine, as currently the only way I can promote it is on my social media spaces. I need to spread the word further! These funds will enable me to run adverts in the print editions and on the magazines' websites.
The other £1,890 goes towards the Indigogo fee and the running costs of the retreats - venues, catering and workshops. 
The perks on offer include signed copies of the Stories for Homes anthology, which is raising money for housing and homeless charity, Shelter, and features one of my stories; a copy of the first anthology of winning stories from the Retreat West Short Story Competition (which is being published in March 2014); critiques of your own writing; 6 week online creative writing courses for beginners; and places at the genre writing retreats.
Every little helps and if I don't reach my funding goal, whatever funds I do raise will be used to pay for as much advertising as I can get for that amount. 
The ImpactIf I can pay for advertising and spread the word further then I'm confident that I can sell all of the spaces on all of the retreats. I ran my first residential retreats in 2013, one of which took place in a National Trust lighthouse cottage. Author, Alison Moore, whose debut novel The Lighthouse was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, ran a workshop at this retreat, which sold out several weeks before it took place. You can see what one of the writers who came on it thought about the retreat here: We all need a lighthouse of our ownThe feedback from other writers that came along was also excellent and Cath Barton said: ""The writing retreat was special in lots of ways, not least for having Alison Moore as workshop tutor. From the moment we arrived Amanda looked after us so well. Highly recommended.""By raising the profile of Retreat West through advertising and selling all of the spaces on these genre retreats, my working life can be transformed. It would free my time to work on my fiction for at least 3 full days a week, meaning I could really develop my body of work.You can read some of my short stories that have been published in Number Eleven Magazine and in the anthology, Stories for Homes, which is raising money for the housing and homeless charity, Shelter. Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't contribute to my project, you can help by:

MY STORY
My name is Predrag Filipović. I have been labeled with many titles, but just recently I realized that I have always been Pedjalaya.

Not as a name, but as a word that means inspiration and motivation to a lot of people. 
I use my senses and my experience to write. Recently, I published my website (www.pedjalaya.com) containing my stories and some articles about self recognition, along with some other stuff. I'm always trying to give my best to the people, and keep inspiring them, but as you know, seeds of wisdom and light need spreading in order to grow, so I'm trying to do it now, and I need your help.

Publishing a book with all of my stories written so far will help those seeds grow. I will still keep the stories on my website free for everyone to read them, but I really want the true readers to be able to have them before bedtime, or in a train, or on a vacation.
My stories are about everything and anything. Usually placing the main character in a world that can be very much real, then giving the reader a series of strange situations twisting their mind in a certain direction, coquetting with paranormal, magic, bizarre, thrill, murder, etc. Feel free to visit my website and read whatever you like.

Como consecuencia de ella, se ve envuelto en las desavenencias de sus padres; siendo un adolescente tiene que abandonar el domicilio familiar y, tras deambular por el Camino de Santiago, es acogido por los monjes de un monasterio. Estos no solo le dan cobijo, sino que a la vez le sufragan los gastos de una carrera universitaria.Con el paso del tiempo, siendo un arquitecto afamado, Poli les recompensa con la restauración del monasterio gratuitamente, única forma que tiene de pagarle lo que un día por él hicieron los monjes.¿Quiénes?Tandaia es una editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.Hoy te presentamos a Domingo Andrés Miguel.En la actualidad tiene sesenta y nueve años y se encuentra jubilado, haciendo una vida tranquila en la localidad que se menciona. Desde su prejubilación ha escrito varios libros, ninguno de ellos publicado, (será porque son muy malos), aunque no los ha presentado a ningún concurso literario. Además del actual, destacan Desempeñar su cometido (biografía de su época laboral), Mi agüelo (obseguio para los nietos), El sonido del silencio (la emigración de un joven para abrirse camino en la vida), La viruela de la vejez (peripecias de unos ancianos en una residencia), y El legado que nos dejaron.¿Por qué?Y por aquí una muestra de lo que encontraréis en sus páginas:«En la paz del interior de la celda recostado sobre su camastro, a su mente fluyeron los recuerdos de cuando de niño llegaba a casa con los pantalones rotos por haber ido al monte con su amigo Tomás a buscar nidos, abriéndose camino por parajes, nunca hollados por ningún otro niño del pueblo, entre matorrales y zarzas.          Recuerdos de su madre, aquella mujer cariñosa, que solamente le regañaba que tuviera cuidado no le fuera a ocurrir algo. Aquella mujer de ojos negros, algo entrada en carnes, que siempre estaba dispuesta a estrecharlo entre sus brazos y apretándolo contra su corazón le perdonaba todo, hiciera la travesura que fuera. Su cara bondadosa y su alegre sonrisa la delataban. No tenía valor para castigarlo»¿Cómo?Para arrancar el proyecto nos hemos fijado como objetivo 880€; esta es la cantidad que recaudaríamos si alrededor de cincuenta mecenas se hiciesen, cada cual, con un ejemplar de esta primera edición.

Born in the ever-hustling city Mumbai and raised in Kuwait, Varun considers himself a global citizen and is passionate about learning new languages. He fell in love with computers at the tender age of four when his dad gave him a computer and gave him the opportunity to play a game that had Tony the Tiger. Thus, tinkering turned to passion, when he chose to spend the rest of his life playing and learning about computers.<br/><br/>A short yet brief trek later he came to the realization of the human element in the digital world and since then there's a different wave, a different future he is riding into. Passionate about Product Management, Varun wants to be “the human” at the junction of the human-product world, taking up challenging ideas and delivering a great customer experience.<br/><br/>Seeking the simple yet biggest question in life, Varun has found the answer to his happiness - people. Always happy to help others selflessly, he strongly believes that one day his vision to make an impact in people's lives in a revolutionary manner to change the world shall come forth and, he, is not afraid to admit that. They say the believers are often crazy ones.<br/><br/>Varun wrote this book because he wanted to motivate people regardless of their sex and sexual orientation. He wanted to make people think that they can dream big and they do not need to have a prestigious college degree to get the right knowledge.<br/><br/>Often to unwind at the end of a long day/week, Varun seeks his recreational recharge in his gaming console, reading books, researching, coding, learning about new technologies, and of course trying to pull off pranks that more often than not miscarry.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Varun at nairv1@udayton.edu and at<br/>Linkedin - <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunnair1997/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunnair1997/</a><br/>Facebook - <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/varuuuuuuunniah/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/varuuuuuuunniah/</a>.<br/>Instagram - <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/varunnair__/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/varunnair__/?hl=en</a></p><h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

With gentle rhyming and fanciful illustrations flowing across the pages, you'll be swept up in the magic of it all, just when we may need it the most.

Love Lottery was fully funding with our crowdfunding platform in less than 24 hours and we were able to unlock 6 stretch goals to make this book come to life in the best possible way!  And we are now moving our pre-orders to Indiegogo!
Don’t buy this book because you need another typical children’s book.  Buy it because you want to share the message of love and show your child that love can conquer all!


For me, my hard times turned to gratitude when I looked at these precious gifts of young innocence and celebrated them- my Love Lotteries.
​I'm confident you will feel my loving intention and connect to this story, as it is now a piece of all of us to share.
Love Lottery:

 
Love Lottery is my heart and soul poured into a book sharing what we can overcome with love, attitudes, wishes, and desires. It demonstrates love conquers all and that no matter what, our children are a blessing that is even greater than winning the lottery...they are our very own Love Lottery!


We have the book completed, and are currently fufilling all orders!  Order your copy today, as this first print run has limited avalability. 
When you read this book alongside your child, my hope is you’ll see how wishes, luck, positivity can offer a glimmer of hope.  You’ll see my vision of how love conquers all.  It is a message we want our children to hear, and for us to be reminded.  It is so important they grow up feeling treasured and there is no greater gift than them being exactly who they are.

This book is beyond beautiful with words, illustrations, and upgrades.
10""x10"" hardcover (with a gold foiled title) It's going to be both stunning inside and out!  
Love Lottery will bring a rainbow of warmth and inspiration to your hearts, creating treasured memories that will stand the test of time.

Yes, we love all the stories about Goldilocks and The Three Bears, adventures, unicorns, mysteries, silly, educational, along with the numerous YOU CAN BE ANYTHING books... the Love Lottery offers a tender and welcomed addition to your bookshelf.
This heartfelt book feels like the sunshine of truth flies off every page.  

With a welcoming and calming color palette, the illustrations impart the warmth and positivity of Love Lottery.  It has been wonderful working with her in the creation of this timeless children's book. Watch as Melanie creates some Love Lottery magic before your very eyes…

Upon reading <i>The Little Engine That Could</i> with Avery, I often found myself wondering what a modern version of the story would look (and sound) like. I wondered if a short, rhyming text paired with bold, modern illustrations would capture her attention even more. So, as hesitant as I was to replicate such a giant in the children’s publishing world, I wrote <i>The Train Rolls On</i> in an effort to update and recreate this classic story in a way that resonates with today’s youth.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Who Am I?</strong></p><p>I am a former Crime Scene Investigator (CSI) turned stay-at-home mom who has a passion for teaching and promoting children’s literacy.

Not knowing where to start, I Googled “How to publish a children’s book” and went from there.

I want to write and publish books that help children develop rich vocabulary and are fun for kids and their caregivers to read. </strong> </p><p>I have seen the spark and love of learning that reading to a child creates, and I want to use my love of writing to give that gift to other kids and their families. I have always wanted to make a difference in the world, and I believe that writing children’s books is one way that I can do that.</p><p> </p><p><strong>2. This book could be the start of a new career path.</strong></p><p>From 2011-2018, I was a CSI and CSI Field Supervisor. Then, my daughter was born…and everything changed. In 2018, I made the difficult decision to leave my CSI career and stay home with Avery full-time. In the end, it was the best decision for our family, and it has led me down this surprising new path of writing and publishing children’s books. I’m hoping to learn and grow through this process and to see where this new journey takes me. If this book is well-received, I'd love to write and publish many, many more. </p><p> </p><p><strong>3. I want to set a strong example for my daughter and teach other aspiring writers how to share their stories with the world.</strong></p><p>Even though my daughter is young, I want to set an example for her, showing her what it means to set a lofty goal and work really hard to achieve it. More than anything, I want her to grow up believing that she can do anything she sets her mind to, even if that means starting a new project (or career) from scratch.  </p><p>In addition, I plan to use my self-publishing experience to help other writers navigate the self-publishing process. Many people have dreamed about writing a book, but they aren’t sure how to make that dream a reality. They don’t know what steps to take or who to turn to for help. I have been there, so I want to do my part to help others fulfill their dream and share their stories with the world.

To this end, David will choose and arrange the book's fonts, design its front and back covers, and assemble the title page and copyright information.

Its messages of perseverance and teamwork encourage readers not to give up and to lean on each other to overcome whatever obstacles they face. Let's share this book and its timely message with as many kids as possible: For every $100 that is pledged beyond $10,000, I will donate 1 additional hardcover book, so please continue to pledge and spread the word about my campaign! Thank you for your support! The SummaryThe Train Rolls On is a rhyming children's book that follows a determined train on a wild zoo adventure and teaches kids perseverance and teamwork. The book is illustrated by Christina Wald, and it will be published in the Spring of 2021. The Train Approaches The Station To Pick Up Its Passengers The DetailsFormat: To be available in hardcover, paperback, and eBook versionsLength: 32 pagesWord Count: 469 WordsRecommended Ages: 3+ The Story In The Train Rolls On, a determined train embarks on a journey to deliver a lively bunch of animals to the zoo for its grand opening.  The Animals Prepare To Board The Train For The Zoo Excerpt:Each ticket is checkedand given a punch.The passengers board-they're one eager bunch! Each animal’s ready.The crew is set, too.The engineer waves.Next stop:  the ZOO!  The coal has been poured,so welcome aboard…and THE TRAIN ROLLS ON!Chugga chugga choo choo! The Animals Board The Train And Depart For The Zoo On its way to the zoo, the train encounters several obstacles: a steep hill, a narrow bridge, and restless, rowdy passengers. Despite feeling tired, scared, and (at times) out of control, the train digs deep and overcomes each obstacle. The Train Nervously Crosses A Tall, Narrow Bridge The Restless Passengers Cause Trouble For The Train Just when the train thinks that it’s home-free, an even bigger obstacle stops it in its tracks.

It also reminds children that it’s okay to ask for help and celebrates teamwork as a means of accomplishing lofty goals. With its rich vocabulary, catchy refrain, and beautiful illustrations, The Train Rolls On is sure to appeal to children and adults alike.If you are interested in reading a longer excerpt from the book, sign up to receive my monthly newsletter at www.JodiAdamsAuthor.com. A free excerpt will be emailed to you immediately following sign-up!   The InspirationOne of my all-time favorite children’s books is The Little Engine That Could. My parents read it to me countless times as a child, and I now enjoy reading it with my daughter, Avery. I love that it combines trains, zoo animals, and toys to teach children about kindness and perseverance. It is an undeniable classic and likely always will be. Avery and I Reading The Little Engine That Could The Train Rolls On is my modern take on this classic train adventure. Upon reading The Little Engine That Could with Avery, I often found myself wondering what a modern version of the story would look (and sound) like. I wondered if a short, rhyming text paired with bold, modern illustrations would capture her attention even more. So, as hesitant as I was to replicate such a giant in the children’s publishing world, I wrote The Train Rolls On in an effort to update and recreate this classic story in a way that resonates with today’s youth. Who Am I?I am a former Crime Scene Investigator (CSI) turned stay-at-home mom who has a passion for teaching and promoting children’s literacy. I live in Omaha, NE, with my husband, Eric, and my three-year-old daughter, Avery.  Eric, Avery, and I Hanging Out At Home Avery and I love reading books together. I have always loved reading and writing, but it wasn’t until Avery was born that I rediscovered my passion for children’s fiction. The Train Rolls On is my first children’s book, but I’m hoping that it will be the first of many.Avery and I Reading On The Porch How Did I Get Here?One day in early 2019, Avery and I were reading stories together when I said to myself: ""Why don’t I write a children’s book? Many others have done it. Why can’t I?"" Shortly afterward, I wrote my first story…and then I couldn’t stop writing.My Writing Space By the end of 2019, I had written several children’s book manuscripts, but I still didn’t know anything about the publishing process. I didn't even know where to start. I just knew that I wanted to share my stories with others. So, this past January, I finally took the leap and decided to figure out what I needed to do to publish at least one book. Not knowing where to start, I Googled “How to publish a children’s book” and went from there. Many, many hours of research later, I have started my own publishing company (Young At Heart Publishing, LLC), and I am well on my way to self-publishing The Train Rolls On.My Author Website The Why  1. I want to write and publish books that help children develop rich vocabulary and are fun for kids and their caregivers to read.  I have seen the spark and love of learning that reading to a child creates, and I want to use my love of writing to give that gift to other kids and their families. I have always wanted to make a difference in the world, and I believe that writing children’s books is one way that I can do that. 2. This book could be the start of a new career path.From 2011-2018, I was a CSI and CSI Field Supervisor. Then, my daughter was born…and everything changed. In 2018, I made the difficult decision to leave my CSI career and stay home with Avery full-time. In the end, it was the best decision for our family, and it has led me down this surprising new path of writing and publishing children’s books. I’m hoping to learn and grow through this process and to see where this new journey takes me. If this book is well-received, I'd love to write and publish many, many more.  3. I want to set a strong example for my daughter and teach other aspiring writers how to share their stories with the world.Even though my daughter is young, I want to set an example for her, showing her what it means to set a lofty goal and work really hard to achieve it. More than anything, I want her to grow up believing that she can do anything she sets her mind to, even if that means starting a new project (or career) from scratch.  In addition, I plan to use my self-publishing experience to help other writers navigate the self-publishing process. Many people have dreamed about writing a book, but they aren’t sure how to make that dream a reality. They don’t know what steps to take or who to turn to for help. I have been there, so I want to do my part to help others fulfill their dream and share their stories with the world. If I can do it, they can too! ""Let's Do This!"" The GoalThe goal of my Kickstarter campaign was to raise enough money to finish the book's illustrations and design and to print the completed books. The IllustrationsChristina Wald began work on the book's illustrations in May. She originally sketched thumbnail-sized spreads in order to determine the best sequence, layout, and viewpoint of each illustration. Then she created full-scale sketches from each thumbnail. The full-scale sketches were completed and approved in mid-August, at which point Christina shifted her focus to sketching and finalizing the book's cover art.  Original Thumbnail Sketches For Pages 2-15 As of the beginning of this campaign, all interior sketches and the final cover art are complete, and Christina is working on converting the interior sketches to final color illustrations. She is planning to complete all interior illustrations by early December. The DesignIn addition to an illustrator, I have hired a professional book designer. His name is David Miles, and his job is to optimize the book's readability and overall aesthetic, ensuring that it conforms to the standards of its genre but still stands out among the crowd. To this end, David will choose and arrange the book's fonts, design its front and back covers, and assemble the title page and copyright information. He will also collaborate all of the book's elements (its pages, text, illustrations, front cover, spine, back cover, etc.) into a cohesive, eye-catching package.David Miles & Family Once I began researching the various elements of book design, I quickly realized how many formatting and design decisions must be made and, thus, how beneficial it would be to have someone walk me through the design process with this first book. By hiring a professional designer, I am hoping to learn about publishing industry standards and the design decision-making process and to elevate the book beyond what I could currently create alone.For more details regarding the decisions that book designers make, check out my What In The World Is A Book Designer & Why Did I Hire One? blog article. The PrintingTo ensure that The Train Rolls On is printed and bound using high-quality materials, I have elected to print the books through IngramSpark. IngramSpark is the self-publishing division of Ingram Content Group, which is the largest printer and distributor of books to bookstores, libraries, and academic institutions across the globe. In other words, they're the real deal! Most major publishing houses turn to Ingram for their book printing and distribution, so I am turning to IngramSpark for mine. IngramSpark will be printing paperback and hardcover versions of the book, both measuring 8"" x 10"" in size.  The Creative Team  The TimelineThe Train Rolls On is completely written and has been professionally edited. The interior sketches and cover are also complete, and Christina Wald is currently working on turning the interior sketches into final color illustrations. I plan to print and ship the books to backers next spring:  December 2020: Complete illustrations January 2021: Complete book design February 2021: Order prototypes; Review and make any necessary adjustments March 2021: Print finished books; Review quality and prepare for shipping April-May 2021: Ship rewards to backers  Yes, the delivery date is several months away, but I can assure you that it will be worth the wait! Good things take time, and our entire team wants to make sure that we have enough time to get everything just right.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p>My name is Aviva Peltin, and I am the author of <i>Get Crunchy: How To Be a Sustainable, Healthy, and Smart Consumer.</i> I wrote this book because I wanted to showcase companies that inspire me and offer products I use regularly. The founders of these companies run sustainably-minded and health-oriented businesses, showing us what is possible. I write about safe and healthy alternatives when considering personal care products, food, clothing, electronics, and housewares. </p>
<p>My book examines the pre-conceived notions of consumers, many of whom assume that if a product is on a shelf in a store, it is safe. Sadly, that assumption is incorrect. We cannot blindly trust companies. </p>
<p>My hope is that you will discover, through reading this book, that transparency in the marketplace is possible. Greenwashing is a modern epidemic — a marketing technique in which brands pretend their products are sustainable and healthy when in actuality, they are not. Examples of greenwashing include products labeled with buzzwords such as, “natural,” “eco-friendly,” “green,” “non-toxic,” and, “earth-friendly,” when in reality, they contain carcinogens and other toxic materials. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that these founders feel about sustainability, business, health, natural living, and conscious consumerism. </p>
<p>You'll learn about the intersections between business, environmentalism, and health: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>I interview the founder of a successful sustainable clothing chain and discuss how to have the most sustainable, healthy, and cutest wardrobe.</p></li>
<li><p>I interview various founders of women’s health companies, such as the owner of a sustainable condom company, the co-creator of period-proof underwear, and the inventor of a fertility monitor that can tell a woman when she can conceive.</p></li>
<li><p>I interview the founder of a glass water bottle and baby bottle company and explain how to avoid consuming a credit card-sized amount of microplastics per week. </p></li>
<li><p>I interview the CEO of an organic heath food store chain and explain why triple-bottom business practices are essential. </p></li>
<li><p>I interview the founder of an integrative pharmacy chain and discuss how the combination of Western and alternative medical approaches can be transformative. </p></li>
</ul>
<h2>Who Will Love the Book</h2>
<p>You will love this book if you are an aspiring entrepreneur who wants to do good in the world. You will also love this book if you want to feel as good as you possibly can and reduce your waste and negative impact on the planet, You will learn how to navigate your conventional grocery store, pharmacy, or online marketplace with greater ease. <i>Get Crunchy</i> speaks to the everyday aspiring “ecopreneur,“ consumer, environmentalist, or health-seeker who is looking to do better. </p>
<h2>The Book</h2>

<p>Part 1 contains the Introduction + Chapters 1 and 2. This section introduces readers to the chemical-laden products universal on store shelves, the dangers of these chemicals, and how the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) isn’t protecting us as much as we like to think. I feature the non-profit, Environmental Working Group (EWG), and other non-profits, and discuss how these organizations are the true superheroes of conscious consumerism. </p>
<p>Part 2 contains Chapters 3 through 13. This section features exclusive interviews with founders and CEOs of sustainability-oriented and health-focused companies that I have admired for years. These companies adhere to the triple-bottom line, meaning that instead of just focusing on profits, they take into account the environmental and ethical implications of what they produce.  </p>
<p>Part 3 contains Chapters 14 through 16. This section showcases social media influencers from the health and zero-waste spaces who share their stories and tips to help you transition to conscious consumerism. </p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Aviva is a recent graduate of The University of Washington, where she majored in English with an emphasis in creative writing. In her free time, she writes screenplays, makes YouTube videos, and contemplates why dogs in sweaters are not more ubiquitous. </p>
<p>Aviva wrote this book because writing and publishing a book was always something she wanted to do. Aviva’s childhood wardrobe consisted of a lot of tie-dye, and she sweetened her tea with stevia before it was mainstream. You could say Aviva was always destined for hippie greatness. When she got ill in the summer of 2010 with chronic Lyme disease, Aviva had to revamp her life and realized she wasn’t living as sustainably and healthfully as she had always thought. While transitioning to a “low-tox life” (i.e., avoiding chemicals and using natural products instead), Aviva realized that the average consumer knows little. As she continued on her health and sustainability journey, Aviva discovered brands that she came to admire — these brands are profit-driven but also take health, the environment, and ethics into consideration. </p>

One of the foundation that I have established is Jewrnalism foundation because I believe that  media- doesn't matter which one: Radio, TV, Blog, web site are the most important tool for opinion making. Thats why we Jews should use it and as well create a change thru word, video, image.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My campaigne is dedicated for young Jewish journalists in Poland that want to make a change in their commuities by describing current reality, asking questions, bringing to light opinions of community members and create a space of discussion and opinion of young future leaders.</p>
<p>That why me, my foundation and organizations that I work in try to join forces and continue in 2016 mission that we have started in 2015. In 2015 we have made 36 meetings between young people and journalists that write for jewrnalism.com or weshalom.pl and we have created around 200 articles. In this year we want to continue with our dicussion meetings and as well with developing weshalom.pl web site.  </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need funds for conducting our meetings and for publishing articles on our web site.</p>
<p>Each month we do 2 meetings, sometimes more if we decide to be toghether during clebrating Jewish holidays. Each meeting is dedicated to different topic and a guest from outside is invited. Our guests are prominent people from world of education, culture or politics. It give us certain thoughts and perpectives that later we can agree wih or not.</p>
<p>Each meeting is in different venue. We rent for our meetings short term flats as well we do not try to create another organization. We want those meetings to be based on friendship between us and intelectual conversations not place, organization or leader.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Each meeting cost us 250 $ so 24 meetings will cost 6000$. We spend mostly on apartment, food and salary for a guest.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Klaudia Klimek and I am fouder of few foundations and projects dedicated to Jewish life in Krakow or Poland. One of the foundation that I have established is Jewrnalism foundation because I believe that  media- doesn't matter which one: Radio, TV, Blog, web site are the most important tool for opinion making. Thats why we Jews should use it and as well create a change thru word, video, image.

My campaigne is dedicated for young Jewish journalists in Poland that want to make a change in their commuities by describing current reality, asking questions, bringing to light opinions of community members and create a space of discussion and opinion of young future leaders.
That why me, my foundation and organizations that I work in try to join forces and continue in 2016 mission that we have started in 2015. In 2015 we have made 36 meetings between young people and journalists that write for jewrnalism.com or weshalom.pl and we have created around 200 articles. In this year we want to continue with our dicussion meetings and as well with developing weshalom.pl web site.  
   What We Need & What You Get We need funds for conducting our meetings and for publishing articles on our web site.
Each month we do 2 meetings, sometimes more if we decide to be toghether during clebrating Jewish holidays. Each meeting is dedicated to different topic and a guest from outside is invited. Our guests are prominent people from world of education, culture or politics. It give us certain thoughts and perpectives that later we can agree wih or not.
Each meeting is in different venue. We rent for our meetings short term flats as well we do not try to create another organization. We want those meetings to be based on friendship between us and intelectual conversations not place, organization or leader.

Each meeting cost us 250 $ so 24 meetings will cost 6000$. We spend mostly on apartment, food and salary for a guest.
Beside that we have costs of publishing articles 1000$

    The Impact We know that our project is valuable because we made it pilot in 2015 and we know that not only we as a members of are satisfied from meetings but as well we know what is the perception on artcles we writ
e. We alredy have made few changes in our community only by word we published and discussion that we have created.
So even if on our meetings come between 15-20 people our message goes much wider that this audience.

<h2>What the book is about.</h2>
<div>
<p>During the past 8 years, I have conducted intense research to acquire more insight into how people perceive glass and how it has been and is used within the arts. The result of my research is this book entitled, <i>GLASS Virtual, Real</i>, which is set to be released in autumn 2016. This book is not another traditional historical or technical publication on glass, but a quest into the relationship between the use of glass within the arts and the intrinsic qualities of the medium. Although I do refer to the history and science of glass, I only do so in function of its relevance to the use of glass in contemporary art. What makes this publication unique is that the whole thesis builds up towards an insightful vision on how glass can be relevant within a contemporary art context.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the entire book aims to explain the recent increase in use of glass within contemporary art and to investigate the effectiveness of glass as a relatively new medium. The last and largest chapter is completely devoted to this and gives a plethora of examples of work from leading contemporary artists such as Gerhard Richter, Josiah Mcelheny, Jaume Plensa, Fred Wilson, Jan Fabre, Wim Delvoye, Joseph Kosuth, Dani Karavan, Ann Veronica Janssens, Donald Lipski, Gabriel Barcia-Colombo, Javier Perez, Larry Bell, Koen Vanmechelen, Maya Lin, Mona Hatoum, Dan Graham, Mario Merz, Robert Smithson, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Luciano Fabro and many more.</p>

<h2>Why this campaign?</h2>
<div>London-based Black Dog Publishing is generously supporting my book. They are a renowned publishing company specialising in art-books. But high quality books like this one are very expensive to produce. Therefore, we are sharing the production costs which means that I have to raise £20,000 GBP. And this is where I need your help.</div>
<div>I have been an artist and educator for about 30 years, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">during which time I observed </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">that the community frequently asked itself how glass fits within </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">contemporary art. In response to this observation, I set out to explore this question 8 years ago. Since then, I have dedicated an enormous amount of time, energy and personal funds into researching this question.</span>
</div>
<div>It's been a long, intriguing but onerous journey and I have learned a great deal from it. But now that I'm so close to sharing my findings with the world, I realise that I can no longer finish this by myself. The research has drained my financial resources and I cannot afford to bear the full load of the publication costs. As well, I have unsuccessfully exhausted all government agency funding because their mandate does not support this kind of international publication.</div>
<h4>
<b>So please forward this campaign to everyone you know to help spread the word.</b> </h4>
<div>Reaching a large audience is a vital step to a successful campaign. It won't cost you anything and will only take a few minutes but it will help me a lot to raise funds.</div>
<h4>Your action will make all the difference.</h4>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Current policies, including the climate of hatred and intolerance they generate, are affecting some of our most vulnerable citizens—including LGBTQ youth—in significant ways. Hidden behind school walls, the harassment and abuse LGBTQ kids experience is often hidden from the rest of us until it's too late.</p>
<p>Policy changes only go so far. What happens in schools is a reflection of a community's values, and changing values requires changing hearts and minds. Therefore, this project also builds in resources such as school-wide and classroom-based presentations, along with topic-related and communication skills training to help educators engage school boards, parents, and community leaders in having the difficult conversations necessary to invoke lasting change.</p>
<p>I'm launching a new project that will augment and expand current safe schools efforts, and will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new book for educators on creating safe and inclusive environments for LGBTQ youth</li>
<li>An LGBTQ speakers’ bureau that will offer accessible and inclusive compassion-focused programming for educators, students, and communities</li>
<li>A pilot multi-disciplinary educational program designed to promote compassion, empathy, and resilience among all students</li>
<li>A program to help school libraries purchase LGBTQ-inclusive materials for students and educators</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Give</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a real difference in the lives of LGBTQ kids, and you'll help make schools safer, better, and more productive for all students. You'll be supporting training for brave, visionary educators who want to transform our schools and communities into more compassionate spaces for us all.</p>
<p>Your support will help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empower educators who are trying to help create safe spaces for LGBTQ students</li>
<li>Provide educators and students with access to LGBTQ-positive/inclusive resources</li>
<li>Support educators and parents who are trying to advocate for change in school policies to support LGBTQ students</li>
<li>Engage communities in non-violent communication around issues of LGBTQ inclusiveness and visibility</li>
<li>Provide programming focused on compassion, empathy, and resilience to under-resourced or otherwise challenged schools/districts</li>
<li>Show LGBTQ students across the country that they are seen, and they matter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>According to researchers from GLSEN (Gay, Lesbian, Straight Education Network), “Schools nationwide are hostile environments for a distressing number of LGBTQ students, the overwhelming majority of whom routinely hear anti-LGBT language and experience vicitimization and discrimination at school.”</p>
<p>Data from GLSEN’s latest “National School Climate Survey” (which contains data from a sample of 10,528 students across the country), shows just how significant and pervasive challenges are at school for LGBTQ youth. </p>
<p>•    85.2% of students experienced verbal harassment<br/>•    98.1% of students heard “gay” used in a negative way at school<br/>•    95.8% of students heard other homophobic remarks, such as “dyke” or “faggot”<br/>•    85.7% of students heard negative remarks specifically about transgender people<br/>•    57.6% of students felt unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation<br/>•    71.5% avoided school functions and 65.7% avoided extracurricular activities because they felt unsafe of uncomfortable<br/>•    31.8% of students missed at least one entire day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable<br/>•    48.6% of students experienced cyberbullying <br/>•    59.6% of students were sexually harassed<br/>•    27% of students were physically harassed<br/>•    13% of students were physically assaulted </p>
<p>And this behavior is in many cases supported, either overtly or implicitly, by school staff and policies: </p>
<p>•    56.2% of students reported hearing homophobic remarks from their teachers or other school staff; 63.5% reported hearing negative remarks about gender expression from teachers or other school staff<br/>•    81.6% of students reported that their school engaged in LGBT-related discriminatory policies or practices<br/>•    57.6% of students who were harassed or assaulted at school did not report the incident to school staff, most often because they doubted that effective intervention would occur, or that the situation would become worse<br/>•    63.5% of students who did report an incident said school staff did nothing in response, or told the student to ignore it.</p>

Data from GLSEN’s latest “National School Climate Survey” (which contains data from a sample of 10,528 students across the country), shows just how significant and pervasive challenges are at school for LGBTQ youth. 
•    85.2% of students experienced verbal harassment•    98.1% of students heard “gay” used in a negative way at school•    95.8% of students heard other homophobic remarks, such as “dyke” or “faggot”•    85.7% of students heard negative remarks specifically about transgender people•    57.6% of students felt unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation•    71.5% avoided school functions and 65.7% avoided extracurricular activities because they felt unsafe of uncomfortable•    31.8% of students missed at least one entire day of school in the past month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable•    48.6% of students experienced cyberbullying •    59.6% of students were sexually harassed•    27% of students were physically harassed•    13% of students were physically assaulted 
And this behavior is in many cases supported, either overtly or implicitly, by school staff and policies: 
•    56.2% of students reported hearing homophobic remarks from their teachers or other school staff; 63.5% reported hearing negative remarks about gender expression from teachers or other school staff•    81.6% of students reported that their school engaged in LGBT-related discriminatory policies or practices•    57.6% of students who were harassed or assaulted at school did not report the incident to school staff, most often because they doubted that effective intervention would occur, or that the situation would become worse•    63.5% of students who did report an incident said school staff did nothing in response, or told the student to ignore it.

<h3>Brief Summary </h3>
<p>I've been accepted as a Fellow at Lambda's
Writers' Retreat in L.A., this June. It's going to be a life-changing
experience; with the support of amazing teachers and a cohort of strong LGBTQ writers,
it will kick my own fiction-writing into a new gear. There isn't another writing program like this currently; however, I need to be able to raise funds for the remaining costs of the retreat,
and to pay for travel costs from London. Any contribution you make will get
me closer to that goal, and will be greatly appreciated!</p>

<h3>Hello out there!</h3>
<p>My name is Stephanie Eberl and I work and play as a make-up artist in Boulder, Colorado. Iv'e been writing since a child and only until recently have I taken it up seriously.</p>
<p>I have started this campaign to raise some of the money that is required to publish a book, and this is just a small portion that would take care of editing costs and online publishing. This book is my life's work. I started writing it four years ago and not until this year did I realize what it was all about!</p>
<p>Not only will your contribution help me achieve one of the most important of my life's accomplishments thus far, but you will also help support the message that my memoir and my soul wants to bring into the world!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT I NEED</strong></p>
<p>In order to publish online, I need a professional editor to go through my manuscript from start to finish, correcting any details or errors that will be required from a publishing house later. I am self-publishing for now, and if everything goes well, I will have gotten an agent or publisher interested in my work.</p>
<p>Once I have covered the costs with your help, you will have the opportunity to read my book on your computer screen through create space, and later when my book gets published, I will give you a signed copy to enjoy! </p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>I feel that my story is important to myself and the world because it is who I really am and have the opportunity to express freely with passion and without reservations. I believe that our stories can transform and bond not only our own lives but other's too, when sharing our tales and life lessons with one another.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>Even five dollars helps! I will not turn down anything, of course no contribution is too small!</p>

<p>Zdravo svima,</p><p>Moje ime je Snežana Radojičić, i ja sam <a href=""http://www.laguna.rs/n2634_knjiga_zakotrljaj_me_oko_sveta_laguna.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pisac </a>i <a href=""http://www.snezanaradojicic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">putnik oko sveta na biciklu</a>.</p>
<p>Od 2011. kotrljam se oko ove naše lepe planete bez ikakvog plana o povratku. Putujem sa vrlo skormnim sredstvima i zbog toga uglavnom kampujem.  Tako sam za četiri godine sabrala preko 1 000
noći pod otvorenim nebom. </p>
<p>Kampovala sam na mnogim nezaboravnim mestima. Ali i na nekim prilično neobičnim: na
'poljima smrti' u severnoj Kambodži, u dvorištima policijskih stanica u
Tajlandu, u džunglama Burme, u kozjem toru u Gobi pustinji... Gledala sam najlepše izlaske i zalaske Sunca, i preživela najrazličitije vremenske nepogode: grad
veličine oraha koji mi je polomio konstrukciju šatora, monsunske pljuskove nakon
kojih sam plutala na podlozi, pustinjske oluje kada sam bila zatrpana slojem peska, snegove i snežne oluje... </p>
<p>A kada sam krenula u ovu avanturu, nisam znala skoro ništa.
Moje iskustvo u kampovanju sastojalo se od dve-tri godine vikend-planinarenja,
u grupi i uglavnom po lepom vremenu. A moja najduža tura biciklom bila je šest
dana po Srbiji.</p>
<p>Srećom, moj prvi saputnik bio je prekaljeni
kamper i cikloputnik. Prvo sam učila od njega, a kasnije i od drugih kampera i
putnika koje sam sretala uživo ili na internet forumima, a najviše na
sopstvenim greškama.</p><p>Sada imam veliko iskustvo. I želim da svoje znanje podelim
sa svima vama. Zbog toga sam napisala dva priručnika:</p>

Neka od poglavlja Kamperskog priručnika sa mini-kuvarom su:



Kako da izaberete odgovarajući šator

Koja podloga vam treba
Perjana ili sintetička vreća?
U čemu se razlikuju pojedini gorionici, kako rade i za
      koje situacije su najfunkcionalniji
Šta obavezno treba da ponesete na svako kampovanje

Kako da zakrpite probušenu podlogu ili pocepan šator
Kako da se okupate kada je hladno ili sa nedovoljno
      vode
Šta da kuvate osim paste i pirinča

Glavna poglavlja u Vodiču za putovanje biciklom su:
Kako da odaberete bicikl shodno svom budžetu
Koje bisage da nabavite ili kako da ih sami napravite ili da improvizujete
Šta od opreme morate da imate, a šta je poželjno mada ne i neophodno
Kako da se što bolje spakujete
Kako da se snađete kad ne znate jezik ili se izgubite

Gde sve možete da spavate jeftino ili besplatno ako ne kampujete
Koliko (može da) košta putovanje biciklom
Šta treba da znate ako ste devojka/žena koja putuje sama

Oba priručnika spremna su za štampanje. Ali, da bi zaista
ugledali svetlost dana, potrebna su sredstva koja ja nemam. Jedini načini da ih
obezbedim su: pretprodaja i mikrofinansiranje. Vaše je da izaberete.

<p>My goal is to expose my wife’s Writing Super Powers by self-publishing her novel DEAD AWAKENINGS.</p>
<p>Remember to check our UPDATES for the latest news!</p>
<p>James Ganiere here. My wife, Rebekah is one of the most talented people that I know. Like all SUPER HEROES she has a WEAKNESS. She has NO idea how AMAZING she is.

She is her own Kryptonite and as such will always stay in the shadows unless revealed. Help me in my campaign to shine the light on her WRITING SUPER POWERS. Help me EXPOSE her true writing powers to the WORLD.</p>

<p>I really love this story Dead Awakenings.</p>

<p>You always hear, “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” But we do and I so often do my self. Many times it’s how I decide what book to pick up in the store to read more. And the same applies even more so online.</p>

Hi! Thanks for looking at our “Expose my wife’s Writing Super Powers” (the Dead Awakenings novel) funding campaign!
My goal is to expose my wife’s Writing Super Powers by self-publishing her novel DEAD AWAKENINGS.
Remember to check our UPDATES for the latest news!
James Ganiere here. My wife, Rebekah is one of the most talented people that I know. Like all SUPER HEROES she has a WEAKNESS. She has NO idea how AMAZING she is. She has forgotten her true identity (or has never discovered it) and believes her secret identity is real, house wife, mother, and home school teacher of 4 children, who are far more interesting than she is. She is her own Kryptonite and as such will always stay in the shadows unless revealed. Help me in my campaign to shine the light on her WRITING SUPER POWERS. Help me EXPOSE her true writing powers to the WORLD.
We have a great novel we’re dying to release. Check out the rewards that the Fantasy & Sci-Fi in all of us would love.
Fans who contribute to DEAD AWAKENINGS’s IndieGoGo campaign are eligible to receive exclusive rewards in exchange for individual pledges ranging from $5 to $5,000.

Summary
When Evaine Michaels wakes strapped to a rusty hospital bed, with no memory of who she is, she knows she's in trouble. But things are only going to get worse for Evaine.
Unable to control her new emotional or physical appetites Evaine is torn between unending hunger and unfathomable rages. But it's the undeniably attraction to the beautiful and elusive Luca that has her in even worse shape.
Luca is a Greek god of a man who wants nothing to do with newborn zombie Evaine, but hard as he tries, neither of them can deny the electric connection when they touch. Or why it is that they can feel each others emotions.
What will happen when Evaine finally remembers who she was, and finds out that her high school sweetheart hasn't give up on finding her. Tristan a millionaire playboy will stop at nothing to get Evaine back, but the journey may lead him to finding out things, that were better left unknown.
As Evaine, Luca and even Tristan try to discover who is experimenting on humans and why, Evaine is forced to choose between the man who makes her feel safe, and the man who's touch ignites her soul.

<h3><em>Vitreous Hide</em></h3>
Help us bring Michael Tod Edgerton's remarkable first book of poetry into the world with a bang. You would want to buy the book anyway, so why not contribute slightly more and help with the production?</div>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>Book Description:</strong></h3>
<p><span>Willing the word to become flesh, the poems in <em>Vitreous Hide </em>both reveal and enact yearning—for love, for the beloved, for the words to transform beloved image to beloved substance. Orpheus reaches for Narcissus through a new mirror of myth, now dim with distance, now bright with the possibility of connection. Through the shining skin or surface of prose lines and field composition, these poems reach for the embodiment of the other in order to be, themselves, embodied.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><strong>Advance praise for <em>Vitreous Hide</em>:</strong></h3>
<p>In a theater of the page permeated by sonic play, Edgerton shuffles together elements and impressions of the Orpheus myth, splicing them together with other aspects of the Greek pantheon, augmented with cameo appearances by Cocteau, Heidegger, Madame Bovary, and a few essential others. True to the Orphic agenda, sound, made overtly and gorgeously lyric, becomes the dominant character, increasingly swept up into a dynamically choreographed typography. It’s a book of big ideas and big feeling, yet carried so lightly on its lyric weave that it becomes almost weightless. A real delight for both ear and mind.</p>
<p>                                                                                                                        - Cole Swensen</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Edgerton is brilliant to announce that myth and the perils of myth are flesh of our flesh, the perdurable instance of our human birth. <em>Vitreous Hide</em> details the dream of that birth and all the loves that keep the dream alive. These poems are the very soul of tenderness.</p>
<p>                                                                                                                         - Donald Revell</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Others will speak of Edgerton’s brilliant use of forms and the dense musical structure that animates the poems of <em>Vitreous Hide</em>, and still others will be clucking their heads at the strange title, which reconstitutes in sound the brutal and the breathy, the upper and lower limits of his speech.  But I want to put in a word for the gay erotics of this work, which seem to me to have no equivalent in modern American poetry.  Really you’d have to go back in time and cross many seas, you’d have to flutter into Cavafy’s bedroom on a warm summer night, in that room above the cafe, the dark room with the many lighted candles, to hear so persuasive, alert, and stunning a love poem.</p>
<div><span class=""il"">                                                                                                                             - Kevin Killian</span></div>

Help us bring Michael Tod Edgerton's remarkable first book of poetry into the world with a bang. You would want to buy the book anyway, so why not contribute slightly more and help with the production?
 
Book Description:
Willing the word to become flesh, the poems in Vitreous Hide both reveal and enact yearning—for love, for the beloved, for the words to transform beloved image to beloved substance. Orpheus reaches for Narcissus through a new mirror of myth, now dim with distance, now bright with the possibility of connection. Through the shining skin or surface of prose lines and field composition, these poems reach for the embodiment of the other in order to be, themselves, embodied.
 
Advance praise for Vitreous Hide:
In a theater of the page permeated by sonic play, Edgerton shuffles together elements and impressions of the Orpheus myth, splicing them together with other aspects of the Greek pantheon, augmented with cameo appearances by Cocteau, Heidegger, Madame Bovary, and a few essential others. True to the Orphic agenda, sound, made overtly and gorgeously lyric, becomes the dominant character, increasingly swept up into a dynamically choreographed typography. It’s a book of big ideas and big feeling, yet carried so lightly on its lyric weave that it becomes almost weightless. A real delight for both ear and mind.
                                                                                                                        - Cole Swensen
 
Edgerton is brilliant to announce that myth and the perils of myth are flesh of our flesh, the perdurable instance of our human birth. Vitreous Hide details the dream of that birth and all the loves that keep the dream alive. These poems are the very soul of tenderness.
                                                                                                                         - Donald Revell
 
Others will speak of Edgerton’s brilliant use of forms and the dense musical structure that animates the poems of Vitreous Hide, and still others will be clucking their heads at the strange title, which reconstitutes in sound the brutal and the breathy, the upper and lower limits of his speech.  But I want to put in a word for the gay erotics of this work, which seem to me to have no equivalent in modern American poetry.  Really you’d have to go back in time and cross many seas, you’d have to flutter into Cavafy’s bedroom on a warm summer night, in that room above the cafe, the dark room with the many lighted candles, to hear so persuasive, alert, and stunning a love poem.
                                                                                                                             - Kevin Killian

From Vitreous Hide:
Dispossessed of the whole     the word     of the whorl 
of the light, the light          of the wet foliage
phosphorescing noon eyes          shower
 
the ground, saturated with falling, petals
your feet, irises          in wet dirt
 
r o o t          s t e m          s t y l e          s t i g m a
 
narcissi soiling the water with aspiration          reflection                   
you take for thirst
 
what slakes of you          the whorling unworlding, the lack of
sift through soft-spoken, even callused hands
 
of the hands and what they do
not say:          lines          veins          hairs          marks
 
of the hands and what they only say      
between the lines:          their caress
 
of the dirt: of the sky: of the feet: of the waves of
sun blears          chromatic
 
edges that compose the garden          burst
of rabbit overtaken into the thickness                   
 
(its empty errant secret)
 
          (thickening)
flies          thicken
 
an exposed turtle eye                   
wide as any moment          of  (shuttering)
 
Tongue I gave you          (saying)
I is the truth you ease          with release

<p><strong>""Recently I was asked to speak at a college in Israel.

If it had been another group, I think I would have helped them also. You can’t let people be treated in an inhuman way around you. Otherwise <em>you</em> start to become inhuman.""—Hetty Voute, pg. 59, took Jewish children to hiding places on her bicycle.</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>""Who cares about what is good for the people?  The soldiers go and fight, but it’s all about what’s in the land—oil or uranium.  There is so much fighting and it costs so much money, but all the while the children had nothing to eat.  Whenever there’s a war, it it’s always the children who have to suffer."" —Clara Dijkstra, page 97, cared for a Jewish baby as her own for four years.</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>""Our leaders, especially, need to be motivated by love, not hate.  And I don’t mean love of money.

<h3>Who's THIS guy?</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Coorlim, and I'm a writer of steampunk fiction. I don't make a lot of money at it, but I earn enough to pay the bills most of the time, which is a good thing because temp and freelancing gigs have been hard to find the last few years. You know how it is.</p>
<h3>What does HE want?</h3>
<p>My laptop has been on its last legs for awhile now: laggy as hell, requiring a startup repair every time, making unpleasant noises whenever it's turned on. My girlfriend tells me that it was getting harder and harder to tell us apart.</p>
<p>Suddenly it stopped working, and that's where we differ. I still need to work, and for me working is writing. Without a laptop, I can't write. As I've found in the past that homelessness isn't as glamouous as it seems, I decided that it would be best to get a replacement. </p>
<p>It turns out that the people who sell laptops want money, not debts, and I only have the latter. That's where you come in.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I <em>need</em>
</h3>
<p>I need a laptop capable of running a word processor (OpenOffice), Scrivener, an image manipulation program (Gimp), and connecting to the internet so I can upload my work. A 15"" screen is the minimum I need to make covers in, and it needs a gig or two of RAM to keep everything running smoothly with whatever bloaty Windows OS I end up with.</p>
<p>IndieGoGo sets a minimum funding goal of $500, so that's what I'm asking for. If I get more I'll spend more money comissioning art from local artists for covers and interior illustrations.</p>

<p>For the minimum $5 donation, you'll get an acknowledgement on my <a href=""http://www.mcoorlim.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Author Homepage"">blog</a> and <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/mcoorlim"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Michael Coorlim on Facebook"">facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>$25 gets you an acknowledgement and an e-copy of ""The Collected Bartleby and James Adventures,"" a collection of four steampunk mystery novelettes, in .pdf, .mobi, and .epub. You will also be mailed a fetching signed bartleby and james bookmark.</p>
<p>$50 gets you the above and an advance e-copy of ""Chronicles of a Gentlewoman,"" a collection of four steampunk thriller novelettes, written on the very laptop you've helped to fund.</p>
<p>$100 gets you the above, and you'll also be given a signed advance physical copy of the paperback collection of all eight novelettes. At this point and beyond, donators will be given acknowledgement in the paperback's front materials.</p>
<p>$500 and you've basically bought me my laptop. Thanks! In addition to all of the above, I'll name a character in some upcoming work after you. The character will play a significant role and then die heroically, saving the day. Maybe he or she will be eaten by a bear! Or blown up by the Kaiser, wouldn't that be something!</p>

<h3>My niece was viciously attacked by a large dog recently. Her face was ripped apart and she is suffering from nerve damage as well as many other problems. She has partial paralisys in her face.</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>As a family we have pooled all the money we can muster up including going in deep credit card debt to help get her the best care possible. </p>
<p>So far we have been able to pay for all the medical care but have reached the breaking point and cannot afford her next surgery which is to hopefully fix the nerve damage. The surgery is scheduled and now we just need the money. We have some but as you can see we are way short of the amount needed. As we raise more money ourselves we will lower the amount we are asking for. I am currently applying for a loan to cover this but just thought I would see if there was a way we coould get some help.</p>
<p>We are a close family and have never asked for anything but have given much. This is our first time on the 'asking' side and it's a hard position to be in. If you feel you can't do anything financially please pray for her. That's all we can ask.</p>
