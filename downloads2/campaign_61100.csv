A wearable that helps you breathe cleaner, healthier air 




TZOA takes data from your immediate environment in real-time and turns it into actionable recommendations to keep you healthy. If you suffer from asthma or allergies, you can use TZOA to help manage your condition and enjoy the air once again. 
TZOA uses internal sensors to track your environment throughout the day, providing you with real-time information, city-wide mapping, and a daily review. Recommendations will help to change behaviors and improve your quality of life.






What People Are Saying















Your Air Matters!
Why did we build TZOA? The World Health Organization has found that 7 million people die prematurely every year from air pollution. 

The air can be worse inside your home than outside (2-5X worse on average). You spend the majority of your life in your home, we all have the right to know if its a safe environment.
If you suffer from asthma or allergies you're already greatly affected by the air you breathe; with the information we provide, you can help manage your condition and enjoy the air once again. 

What's Inside?





TZOA contains a high-tech optical laser that measures the amount of physical particles in the air around you, both those you can see with the naked eye, and the ones that are so small you don't even know they exist. 
The ultra-fine particles that we detect contribute to serious respiratory and cardiac issues when breathed in, as well as aggravate asthma and allergies.



We have carefully selected 5 sensors that give a holistic picture of your environment. Context is very important for air quality detection.





TZOA App: 3 Simple Interactions




We use 
Bluetooth to send and share data to your smartphone. Once TZOA is 
connected to your smartphone, our iOS or Android app will visualize your 
environment and give you full access to the data you collect. 
The TZOA app provides a real-time air quality report, a daily digest of your environmental exposures, and crowdsourced air quality maps.

1. Real-Time Air Quality Report





TZOA takes data from your immediate environment in real-time and turns it into actionable recommendations to keep you healthy. 
For example: opening your windows for ventilation, choosing less polluted routes, and making sure you are getting enough sunshine during the winter (and not too much in during the summer).



2. Your Daily Digest




Open up the TZOA app at the end of the day to see your daily exposure levels. Your daily digest knows where you were located, the average air quality in each area, and how much time you spent there. It then provides recommendations.
This information allows you to investigate what happened throughout the day, good or bad, and helps form behavioral change for tomorrow.


3. Crowdsourced Maps





TZOA empowers you to become a citizen scientist. You will play an important role in building air quality 
maps of entire cities and countries, all the way down to your local 
neighborhood. With family, friends and fellow TZOA-users, we can all come 
together and build something that makes a difference.

You can use these maps to plan your route 
to work, avoid areas with reported allergens, decide where to have a picnic with your family, as well as 
using the data to promote social change. 









The Technology

Our optical air quality sensor detects PM (Particulate Matter) 2.5 and 10. These are tiny particles floating in the air that cause permanent damage to our lungs. Our sensor incorporates a 630nm (red) laser along with a photodiode to capture the light intensity and determine the amount of particles as well as their size. 
This is our custom-built test chamber which allows us to compare our sensor to reference devices that are worth $2,000-$20,000+. We use an industrial HEPA filter which prevents unwanted particulate matter from entering the chamber in order for us to conduct proper testing and refine our algorithms. 









This graph compares the TZOA sensor to a $3000 TSI DRX sensor. We've done 3rd party testing that shows a great .9253 R-squared (correlation) value.

Below is a close up of one of the peak events across multiple sensors.


Here is a scatter plot showing our R-squared value against the TSI DustTrak.

                              
Our circuit boards are 
black. Why? With a laser inside and a photo-diode to collect the light, we had to reduce reflectivity within the device 
itself. As an 
added bonus, we think it looks pretty cool!



What you see above is our current device for researchers. Our next stages are shrinking the technology into the smaller consumer TZOA design and further improving the algorithms and software. 









Research Device



We've partnered with researchers from Universities and organizations across North America to build a device just for them. Current devices for researchers are bulky, dumb, and expensive. Our goal was to create a smart device that is affordable and has a miniature form factor, and we're confident that we succeeded. You be the judge!


The research device features:-Bluetooth communication and data extraction-Double capacity battery-Data logging with removeable SD card slot-Micro-USB port for constant power and data extraction-Higher quality components for better accuracy/sensitivity -More ruggedized design-Configuration panel that enables access to device settings such as logging frequency, calibration values, sleep mode, and fan power.
In June, ten of our research devices are participating in a study in conjunction with the University of British Columbia. They will be taken to India where local volunteers will use them to track their personal exposure to particulate pollution. This is a brand new way of doing air quality research and our technology will allow for new studies to be done with larger deployments and personal exposure tracking.In addition, the researchers we are working with are helping us improve our technology to prepare for our consumer TZOA device for you. You will be using the same technology that researchers around the world use for scientific studies!



Our Team
We've built a strong team comprised of people who have been in the 
trenches before and know what they're doing. We have built large-scale 
products, grown companies from the ground up, and we're all very 
passionate about what we do. 



Being based out of Vancouver and San Francisco, we were inspired to make a difference in the world 
and TZOA is the way to do it. Join our team and let's do something 
unprecedented in order to make the world a better place.

For both our prototyping and manufacturing, we have partnered with MistyWest, an engineering design consultancy with a broad range of experience. 
MistyWest develops products that combine the best of function and aesthetics with a focus on new technologies. The multi-disciplinary team at MistyWest includes mechanical, electrical and software engineers along with industrial designers that are working closely with the Tzoa team to help make bring this innovative product to market.








Our Mission
Our mission is to create a social movement for environmental change. We believe awareness leads to advocacy, which leads to action - helping perpetuate innovation and green technology. 
With TZOA, we want to bring air quality data to every person on Earth - whether you're concerned about the air in your home, on your commute, or in your community.


How do I contact the team?
Please feel free to reach out to us at info[at]mytzoa.com  and someone from the team would be happy to get back to you.

 Timeline of Engineering:


We are planning on doing all of the R&D and the majority of manufacturing in North America. We think it's important to stick by our own environmentally friendly principles and do this the right way. We will also implement a recycling program for our devices before they are shipped.",38.0,1,"1 Campaign

We patented and manufactured the only bracket that lets you use your bike riding both forward and backwards. The front chainrings, that turn ever onward allow to you to use the gearshift and the derailleur, also pedaling backwards. The Bixe does not alter the structure or function of the bicycle itself. Conversely, it adds one more chance in its use because it allows to exploit different muscles , due to the effort reversal.<br/>

wheelchairs . In fact ,if you go backwards with a standard wheelchair to
overcome a little bump you risk to lose balance , unless there is someone to
help you. So we thought to design a bixe for them to make them free to go
safely and independently wherever they want.</p>

<p><span>L’innovazione del Bixegear sta nel concetto principale: pensare ad un modo alternativo per andare in bici. Abbiamo cambiato il modo di concepire il concetto di andare in bicicletta come lo conosciamo con la pedalata alternata. Il Bixegear permette di andare avanti anche pedalando all'indietro.</span></p>

<p><i>“il Bixe Gear è stato un contributo essenziale per il nostro successo nella gara della passata edizione. Dopo aver riprogettato il nostro rover per la gara del 2015 volevamo,che la persona rivolta all’indietro fosse in grado di pedalare in qualunque modo volesse. Con il vostro Bixe Gear siamo stati in grado di realizzare proprio questo. Il pilota rivolto all’indietro ha avuto la possibilità di pedalare nel modo in cui voleva .Il Bixe Gear è stato un contributo essenziale per il nostro successo nella gara 2015 e perciò prevediamo di utilizzarlo sicuramente,anche durante la prossima CCSU NASA Rover Challenge nel 2016. Nel complesso, siamo molto soddisfatti del prodotto e ne consiglieremo l'uso nei rover da competizione che hanno i sedili rivolti uno di fronte all’altro”.</i></p>

<p><span>La passione per la bicicletta, mezzo semplice e geniale, ci accompagna fin da bambini, e ci ha fatto notare che gli unici cambiamenti apportati, nel corso della sua storia, sono stati quelli sui materiali dei singoli componenti, mentre la struttura di base è rimasta la stessa. Dato che siamo costantemente alla ricerca di idee che abbiamo il potenziale per andare incontro ai desideri e alle esigenze delle persone , abbiamo pensato di guardare alla bicicletta in un’ottica diversa, cambiandone il concetto e andare oltre. Come ? Affrontando la vita da un’ottica alternata, con il Bixe: l’ingranaggio che ha rivoluzionato , per sempre il concetto di andare in bicicletta, ottenendo più energia e forza questo fantastico mezzo!</span></p>

                             Let's introduce Bixe 






The
Bixegear’s innovativeness lies in the main concept : think alternative to ride
your bike. We changed the way of conceive the concept of cycling as we know it
with the alternating pedaling. The Bixegear permits to go forwards even
pedaling backwards.


                                               what people are saying


""We wanted
the rear facing person to be able to pedal whichever way they want. With your
Bixe Gear, we were able to accomplish just that. The rear facing rider now has
the ability to pedal which ever way they please so they don't have to worry
about accidentally pedal backwards. The Bixe Gear was an essential contributor to our success in
this past years race. Additionally, we fully anticipate using the Bixe Gear
during the next race in 2016. We are very satisfied with your product
and recommend its use in other two way facing rovers at the competition"". 
     Tom
Frost, Project Leader of the 2015-2016 CCSU NASA Rover Challenge Team







""I
made an official visit to the pavilion dedicated to the Sport set up in Bastia
Umbra on the occasion of Expo Regalo and I discovered the BIXE Gear ! I was curious to try it and I have been impressed by the performance of the
mechanism"".
        Giovanni
Malago, President of the Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI)

""It's
amazing the sense of well-being that I felt on trying the alternating pedaling
backwards and forwards, while maintaining a constant stroke frequency . I
recommend it to all professional and amateur cyclists"".
                 Massimiliano Gentili, Professional Cyclist“The alternating
pedaling increases the strenght of the ciclyst with a lower wear of the
joints and a greater comfort for the joints districts involved, especially for
the knees and the ankles”.

                                      Bixe at work 



     


We patented and manufactured the only bracket that lets you use your bike riding both forward and backwards. The front chainrings, that turn ever onward allow to you to use the gearshift and the derailleur, also pedaling backwards. The Bixe does not alter the structure or function of the bicycle itself. Conversely, it adds one more chance in its use because it allows to exploit different muscles , due to the effort reversal.


Imagine to have the possibility to go forward even pedaling backwards.

                                      Bixe story 
                                                  Why  Bixe was created
We have loved bikes, since we were children, and we noticed that this simple and ingenious means, has maintained its basic structure  throughout its story. In fact the only changes have been made on the materials of the individual components. So, as we are constantly looking for ideas that have the potential to respond to the current people’s needs, we changed the concept of bicycle as we know it, and we moved beyond . How? Facing life from an 'alternate' perspective with the BIXE , the gear that has revolutionized the concept of cycling forever. It lets get gaining more energy and strenght out of this fantastic means !
                                                    How Bixe was born 
 First prototype :  the first objective of this prototype was to test “on  the road"", the effect of pedaling both forward and backwars to understand if the idea could be really good and interesting
                
The evolution :  the mechanism is inserted in the bottom bracket. This prototype did  many kilometers and collected many consents . So we improved the system and reduced its size.           


                 

Final prototype : the mechanism has been reduced and provided with a mechanical release on the handlebar that allows to engage and disengage  the backwards pedaling,at will. Birth of the first gene X. 
                   


The patent :  the fully-developed pedaling system APS ( Advanced System pedaling ) has been patented.

                    Why bixe needs your support 


We realized that despite the positive feedbacks about our product, to produce it in high enough volume and make it affordable to everyone, requires
capital. Moreover if we exceed the amount established as the goal, we might be able to finance the following pieces of our project:

Here we are our stretch goals:
                                     put in production the Bixe47 version 


The
mechanism is  provided with a mechanical release on the handlebar
which allows to switch off / switch on the backwards pedaling , meanwhile the traditional
pedaling forwards remains always active.




    
                                     developing bixe prototype for wheelchairs
The
idea was born listening to and living in contact with friends, who told us, that it's difficult to them overcoming even small levels in height and bumps by their
wheelchairs . In fact ,if you go backwards with a standard wheelchair to
overcome a little bump you risk to lose balance , unless there is someone to
help you. So we thought to design a bixe for them to make them free to go
safely and independently wherever they want.

Bixegear: Resta in forma e divertiti! Il modo innovativo per allenarsi dimezzando la fatica 

                                     
                                      Cos'è il Bixe


L’innovazione del Bixegear sta nel concetto principale: pensare ad un modo alternativo per andare in bici. Abbiamo cambiato il modo di concepire il concetto di andare in bicicletta come lo conosciamo con la pedalata alternata. Il Bixegear permette di andare avanti anche pedalando all'indietro.
                                                       Cosa dicono di noi
“il Bixe Gear è stato un contributo essenziale per il nostro successo nella gara della passata edizione. Dopo aver riprogettato il nostro rover per la gara del 2015 volevamo,che la persona rivolta all’indietro fosse in grado di pedalare in qualunque modo volesse. Con il vostro Bixe Gear siamo stati in grado di realizzare proprio questo. Il pilota rivolto all’indietro ha avuto la possibilità di pedalare nel modo in cui voleva .Il Bixe Gear è stato un contributo essenziale per il nostro successo nella gara 2015 e perciò prevediamo di utilizzarlo sicuramente,anche durante la prossima CCSU NASA Rover Challenge nel 2016. Nel complesso, siamo molto soddisfatti del prodotto e ne consiglieremo l'uso nei rover da competizione che hanno i sedili rivolti uno di fronte all’altro”.
Tom Frost attuale Project Leader del team 2015-2016 CCSU NASA Rover Challenge


“Mi sono recato in visita ufficiale al padiglione dedicato allo Sport allestito a Bastia Umbra nell’ambito di Expo Regalo, ed ho scoperto Bixe Gear! L’ho provato con molta curiosità e sono rimasto favorevolmente colpito dalle prestazioni del meccanismo”
Giovanni Malagò, Presidente del Coni


“È incredibile la sensazione di benessere che si prova alternando la pedalata in avanti e indietro pur mantenendo costante la frequenza di corsa. Lo consiglio a tutti i ciclisti professionisti e dilettanti”.
Massimiliano Gentili, Ciclista Professionista
“Alternando la pedalata aumenta la resistenza del ciclista con una minore usura delle articolazioni e maggior benessere per i distretti articolari coinvolti, ginocchia e caviglie principalmente”.


Giovanni Boni, Medico Chirurgo Specialista in medicina dello sport Medico della nazionale italiana ciclismo fuoristrada OLIMPIADI LONDRA 2012.

                                                               Bixe all’opera
      
Abbiamo brevettato e realizzato l’unico movimento centrale che permette di usare la bicicletta pedalando sia in avanti che indietro. Le corone anteriori ruotando sempre in avanti permettono di usare cambio e deragliatore anche pedalando indietro.
Il Bixe non altera né la struttura né le funzioni della bicicletta, ma aggiunge una possibilità in più nell’uso sfruttando muscoli diversi grazie all’inversione di sforzo.
Immagina di avere la possibilità di spingere all’indietro ed andare sempre avanti

                                     Storia del Bixe
                                                  perché bixe è stato creato
La passione per la bicicletta, mezzo semplice e geniale, ci accompagna fin da bambini, e ci ha fatto notare che gli unici cambiamenti apportati, nel corso della sua storia, sono stati quelli sui materiali dei singoli componenti, mentre la struttura di base è rimasta la stessa. Dato che siamo costantemente alla ricerca di idee che abbiamo il potenziale per andare incontro ai desideri e alle esigenze delle persone , abbiamo pensato di guardare alla bicicletta in un’ottica diversa, cambiandone il concetto e andare oltre. Come ? Affrontando la vita da un’ottica alternata, con il Bixe: l’ingranaggio che ha rivoluzionato , per sempre il concetto di andare in bicicletta, ottenendo più energia e forza questo fantastico mezzo!
                                                       come è nato Bixe
Primo Prototipo: il primo obiettivo di questo prototipo è stato quello di testare su “strada” l’effetto di pedalare sia avanti che indietro per capire se l’idea poteva essere veramente valida e interessante.
           
L’evoluzione: Il meccanismo viene inserito nel movimento centrale. Questo prototipo ha percorso molti km e raccolto tanti consensi, che ci hanno stimolato a migliorare il sistema e ridurne le dimensioni.

                   
Prototipo finale: Il meccanismo viene ridotto e dotato di un sistema meccanico di sblocco al manubrio che permette di inserire e disinserire a piacimento la pedalata indietro. Nasce il primo gene X.

                        
Il brevetto: Il sistema di pedalata evoluto APS (Advanced Pedaling System) viene brevettato. 

                                 

                                                            

                                Il Team di Bixe

Giovanni Pignatta (Direttore) diplomato in Congegneria Meccanica ha acquisito una grande esperienza nella costruzione di componenti per veicoli speciali. Ha fondato l’azienda Bixe per cercare nuove opportunità nel settore tecnologico e in quello meccanico. Francesca Coglitore (CEO), specializzata nel ramo della contabilità, amministrazione e nel custumer satisfaction diventa socia della società Bixe, decidendosi di mettersi in gioco seguendo la nascita e lo sviluppo dell’innovativo meccanismo di pedalata Bixegear. Alessio Mezzetti (Ingnere) Laureatosi in Ingegneria meccanica , ha lavorato come ingegnere meccanico, collaborando con diverse aziende di successo .Le sue grandi competenze lo fanno entrare nel team Bixe come ingegnere del progetto.) Luca Comodi (Communication Manager) Laureato nella specialistica in Comunicazione d’Impresa segue la comunicazione Bixe. Esperto di comunicazione e marketing, sviluppa strategie e contenuti per campagne di comunicazione da indirizzare negli innovativi mezzi on-line e nei tradizionali mezzi off-line. Barbara Passeri (Marketing Manager ) Laureata in Lingue e Letterature straniere ha lavorato in diversi ambiti curando i rapporti con le istituzioni, clienti e fornitori esteri.Collabora con il team Bixe per rafforzare il marketing internazionale.

       Perché Bixe ha bisogno del Vostro sostegno
Nonostante i riscontri positivi che abbiamo avuto sul prodotto, ci siamo accorti che per avere una produzione tale per abbattere i costi e renderlo accessibile a tutti, occorre capitale. Inoltre se riuscissimo ad andare oltre la somma posta come obiettivo potremmo realizzare altre due componenti del nostro progetto:
                               mettere in produzione la versione Bixe47
Il meccanismo in oggetto e’ dotato di un sistema meccanico di sblocco al manubrio che permette di disinserire/inserire la pedalata indietro, la pedalata in avanti tradizionale rimane sempre attiva.

           Continuare nella prototipazione della versione Bixe per sedie a rotelle
L’idea ci è venuta ascoltando e stando in contatto con amici che ci hanno spiegato le difficoltà che incontrano con le attuali sedie a rotelle nel superare piccolo dossi o scalini. Infatti nel mandare le ruote all’indietro per superare anche il minimo ostacolo, rischiano di perdere l’equilibrio , a meno che non ci sia qualcuno che li accompagni. E’ per questo che abbiamo pensato di progettare un Bixe apposito, per renderli autonomi e liberi di andare in sicurezza dove vogliono.

<p>Do
you feel powerless or helpless when it comes to modern healthcare?  Are you tired of conflicting information in
the media about what is good for you and what isn’t?  Here at the Integrative Health Consulting

we want to help our clients with whatever ails them, we want to take the time
to empower them through education as well.

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Revolutions are not
easy, as change can be a challenge. Healthcare as it stands can be as sick as
the patients that are seeking treatment. We can do better, and we want to help educate
everyone in being better with their health in very real ways. It starts with
prevention and education and ends with better health outcomes for those who are
willing to change.  By affecting the
surrounding community we hope to create a grass roots movement of cohesive
alternative medicine that changes the landscape of medicine as we know it.  If more and more people take responsibility
for their health the landscape of western medicine will have no choice but to
recognize and work with, instead of against, non-traditional modalities of
medicine that have been proven to work for thousands of years.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Change is hard and
the changes we are aiming for may be slow. The real risk is that what we are
attempting may not go far enough, and this is why we need all the extra funds
and word of mouth we can obtain to overcome this challenge. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If
you cannot contribute funds, you can still help our cause by getting the word
out.  Simply posting the fundraising information
on Twitter, liking and sharing IHCG on Facebook, or sharing us on any of the social networks you utilize. Word of mouth helps too!  Remember that you can still have a chance to win perk prizes by using your share tools on your Indiegogo account and social media sites by raising funds through referrals too!

Our goal, as Rutgers University students, is to supply the children  of Liberia and Sierra Leone with safe, drinkable water.
How can YOU help?
Your generous donation will help distribute portable water purifiers in the form of straws. These straws, produced by Water is Life, can be used in any water source to create drinkable water. They can make a huge difference in a child's life and can be the distinction between life and death.

<p>FACT: Over the past three decades, childhood obesity rates in America have tripled</p>
<p>FACT: Today, nearly one in three children in America are overweight or obese.</p>
<p>FACT: In the US, families spend over 200 billion dollars on grocery related food items.</p>
<p>FACT: Over 50% of that is spent on unhealthy &amp; processed foods that are driving the prevalence of obesity-related diseases and healthcare costs through the roof.</p>
<p>FACT: If we don't solve this problem, one third of all children born in 2000 or later will suffer from diabetes at some point in their lives. Many others will face chronic obesity-related health problems like heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, and asthma.</p>

<em>""<em>When I learned I had Arrhythmia and that exercising was its best cure, </em>I became devoted to combining heart wave technology with exercise training. This is how HeartWave came into being.""     </em>-Scott Cheng, Co-founder</div>
<p>When cycling or running, mounting slopes and surpassing others require sudden energy bursts. By being able to calculate lactic-acid accumulations through heart wave documentations, our HeartWave sensor accurately and interestingly captures and predicts moments of surging adrenaline, racing hearts, and burning muscles. Mastering lactic-acid accumulations also prolongs exercise trainings by avoiding energy exhaustion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is HeartWave?</h2>
<p><img alt=""HeartWave with soft belt"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kowcup.com/heartwave/hwbelttext.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""HeartWave""/></p>
<p>HeartWave is your personal &amp; portable body energy monitor!<br/><br/> When your heart beats, it sends out small electric signals. HeartWave captures these signals to document cardiovascular activities during exercise.<br/><br/> In the past, only heavy machines in labs or hospitals could do this. Now with HeartWave, which weighs only 20 grams and models after Iron Man, you can easily access your complete heart wave signals! These signals, collected on the NeedForWave App displays your WaveNitro alongside your racing information.</p>

<div>
<h2>WaveNitro is your Body Nitro!</h2>
<p>Our inspiration for WaveNitro derives from the famous video game <em>Need For Speed</em>.<br/> In the game, players utilizes their nitro to blow by opponents or to surge past the finish line and win. <br/> As the trademark of our NeedForWave App, WaveNitro similarly calculates body energies through lactic-acid accumulations to suggest recommended acceleration and deceleration timings. When your body’s lactic-acid accumulates, WaveNitro drops. When you slow down your pace, lactic-acid levels drop as your WaveNitro indicator recharges.</p>

<p>WaveNitro system serves as your personal interval training coach. By conducting interval training, you will be able to go faster, go longer, and burn fat more quickly.</p>

“With Iron Man’s blue light, Heartwave leads marathon runners and cyclists to success.”   -Lance, bnext.com.tw“A new perspective to tele-healthcare application.”  -Kate, POiNT Magazine“Users can adjust their body states at any time, and avoid risks of excessive exercising.”  -Atticus, cool3c.com

Why?

""When I learned I had Arrhythmia and that exercising was its best cure, I became devoted to combining heart wave technology with exercise training. This is how HeartWave came into being.""     -Scott Cheng, Co-founder
When cycling or running, mounting slopes and surpassing others require sudden energy bursts. By being able to calculate lactic-acid accumulations through heart wave documentations, our HeartWave sensor accurately and interestingly captures and predicts moments of surging adrenaline, racing hearts, and burning muscles. Mastering lactic-acid accumulations also prolongs exercise trainings by avoiding energy exhaustion.
 
What is HeartWave?

HeartWave is your personal & portable body energy monitor! When your heart beats, it sends out small electric signals. HeartWave captures these signals to document cardiovascular activities during exercise. In the past, only heavy machines in labs or hospitals could do this. Now with HeartWave, which weighs only 20 grams and models after Iron Man, you can easily access your complete heart wave signals! These signals, collected on the NeedForWave App displays your WaveNitro alongside your racing information.
 

WaveNitro is your Body Nitro!
Our inspiration for WaveNitro derives from the famous video game Need For Speed. In the game, players utilizes their nitro to blow by opponents or to surge past the finish line and win.  As the trademark of our NeedForWave App, WaveNitro similarly calculates body energies through lactic-acid accumulations to suggest recommended acceleration and deceleration timings. When your body’s lactic-acid accumulates, WaveNitro drops. When you slow down your pace, lactic-acid levels drop as your WaveNitro indicator recharges.


WaveNitro system serves as your personal interval training coach. By conducting interval training, you will be able to go faster, go longer, and burn fat more quickly.

Using WaveNitro makes exercise more effective and entertaining!

As a Marine & inventor, he's committed to ensuring that every bilateral amputee has access to Stump Armour: an affordable, durable device that can open up more mobility possibilities for amputees and hence improve the their quality of life.  Featured by re3D covering the manufacturing process:  https://re3d.org/made-in-america-3d-printing-pr...Stump Armour is a working foot 100% made in America.  Designed specifically for bilateral above knee amputees to maximize their mobility close to the ground, it was originally designed for performing mechanic work.  There has been some interest by single amputees, some for climbing.  The device minimizes effort to stand up from any position, to move short distances, reach items on the ground, lift heavy objects, or simply work out.  In some cases it significantly reduces strain on the lower back. SITE VISITORS: WE JUST NEED EVERYONE THAT VISITS THE SITE TO GIVE A BUCK.  Had over 4800 visits on the first campaign.  We'll be able to give away lots more feet if everyone just puts in a buck.  Why we need your help: to keep costs low we need $10,000 to pay off a loan for the first production run and have enough left to do a 2nd run, minimum of 25 pairs. Less than 25 in a run costs more.  All contributions will go towards purchasing Stump Armour for amputees that need it.  With your help we can empower amputees and improve their quality of life.A minimum of 10% of profits will be donated to non-profit organizations that have helped this project to include the Gary Sinise Foundation and 100 Entrepreneurs Project after we meet 10K between both campaigns. DevelopmentThis was created by a combat wounded Marine with bilateral trans-femoral (above knee, AK) amputations.  The development of this foot began while trying to find a better way to do mechanical work on the ground after injury.

<p></p>
<p>Your child wants to go play at the park, but you have a full day of grocery shopping, and housework ahead of you. So do you make your child sit and watch TV, while you take care of business? Or let them go outside and play at the park across the street?</p>
<p>With Ecoh, you can set up safe zones which effectively keeps your children within areas which you have designated safe. If they try to leave the area, you will be immediately notified via your Ecoh mobile app.</p>
<p>Setting up safe zones can be done from anywhere too. So even if you’re stuck at work, and little Billy wants to go play at his friend Robbie’s house around the corner, you can set up an E-Path that he will take to walk there, and then an E-Zone to make sure he stays there, all from your office desk.</p>
<p>Kids can get back to playing outside and running around at parks, just like they used to. The world outside is safer with Ecoh.</p>

<h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Security that's child proof</span></h2>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Ecoh comes with proximity sensors that can be worn on your kid's wrist, or attached to their shoe laces. If for any reason the Ecoh is out of range of the sensors, an alarm will sound and you will be notified on your smart phone.</p>
<p>From the outset, our goal was to produce a reliable, wearable device for children. Kids have a habit of breaking stuff, so we made sure Ecoh will handle anything a child can throw at it. Protected from dust and dirt penetration, Ecoh can even be submerged in up to 3 feet of water for a short time, and still remain operational.</p>

<p>We designed Ecoh to be as simple to use as possible. The app was no exception. Using the app dashboard, you will be able to easily configure your Ecoh device. You will also be able to select functions, and change the way the app works by customizing a number of options and features within the app dashboard itself.</p>

<b>How many Ecoh devices do I need?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
        We recommend having one per child. You will be able to configure and tether all of your Ecoh devices securely to the one smart phone app on your mobile device.</div>
<div style=""background-color: #def0f8; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 3px;"">
<b>Can I buy one for my elderly parent?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
        Sure! You can buy Ecoh for anyone. Ecoh is not limited to just keeping children safe. It is aimed at simplifying communication and making sure that the people you love most, are always safe, no matter how old they are.</div>
<div style=""background-color: #def0f8; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 3px;"">
<b>Can anyone setup Ecoh?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
        You betcha! You simply take your new Ecoh out of the box, insert your Nano SIM card, download the app to your mobile device and pair your Ecoh with the app, and you're ready to go!</div>
<div style=""background-color: #def0f8; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 3px;"">
<b>How do I pair the Ecoh with my phone or tablet?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
    Pairing the device is as simple as scanning a unique QR code that’s supplied with your new Ecoh. Just to make sure you don’t have any trouble, the mobile app will guide you through the simple procedure, step by step.</div>
<div style=""background-color: #def0f8; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 3px;"">
<b>What happens if my child tries to call me, but can’t get through?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
        (1) First Ecoh will try the other assigned speed dial phone number. <br/><br/>

(2) If that number cannot be reached either, Ecoh will automatically begin to redial the two programmed speed dial numbers up to 9 times (The number of re-dial attempts can be tailored in the app settings from 0-9 attempts). <br/><br/>

(3) If it's still unsuccessful in making a connection to the guardians phone numbers, Ecoh will go into what we call “dynamic black box” mode and begin recording and saving all available data, such as video, audio, and GPS location co-ordinates. Ecoh will also attempt to re-dial the guardians’ phones every few minutes, and once a connection has been established, all saved data can be transmitted to the guardians’ mobile device. <br/><br/>

(4) If no connection has been made after a user defined interval (between 0 – 15 minutes),Ecoh will begin to automatically dial secondary phone numbers in sequence until a connection is made. This feature is activated within the app and is customizable. Where no connection to any of the primary or secondary numbers can be made, Ecoh can be programmed to automatically dial emergency services numbers, like 911, 112, or 000. The user can set up Ecoh to automatically call emergency services if a number of triggers are met. For instance, if the child rapidly departs an E-Zone, a significant impact is detected by the shock sensors, or the Ecoh is separated from the child beyond a predetermined period of time. This feature is fully customizable, and can be switched off or enabled via the app.</div>
<div style=""background-color: #def0f8; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 3px;"">
<b>Can my child dial Emergency services direct?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
        Yes! Emergency numbers must be programmed into the Ecoh device during the initial set up procedure before first use. To dial Emergency services, the child must hold down the two speed-dial buttons for at least 5 seconds. This will activate an outgoing emergency services call. This feature can be switched off or enabled via the app.</div>
<div style=""background-color: #def0f8; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 3px;"">
<b>What happens if my phone dies?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
        If a paired phone dies, the user will be required to de-register the dead phone, and register an alternative or new device before it can be tethered to the Ecoh. 
If a tethered mobile device's battery dies, the user won't be able to monitor the Ecoh unless they have access to another tethered mobile device, or their PC or Mac is running the Ecoh application Software.</div>
<div style=""background-color: #def0f8; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 3px;"">
<b>I'd like to store many phone numbers into my Ecoh, is this possible, and if so, how do I go about dialing those numbers?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
        When activated, Ecoh will be able to initiate outgoing calls via voice actuation. This means you can store as many phone numbers as you’d like into your Ecoh, and call any one of them easily. To actuate voice dialing, the user taps both speed dial buttons twice in quick succession, at which point Ecoh will beep and all LED’s will light up green, prompting you to say “Call (Name)”. Ecoh will then dial the appropriate phone number. To end the call, double tap both speed dial buttons, and the call is ended.</div>

<b>Can the device be switched off by anyone?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
        No. To switch your Ecoh off, the device and the paired mobile app must be within 2 meters of each other. This is a security measure we’ve implemented to ensure nobody can bypass the system by simply switching Ecoh off.</div>
<div style=""background-color: #def0f8; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 3px;"">
<b>How secure is Ecoh?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
        Security was paramount when we were developing Ecoh, so we have used the latest secure data transferring methods/protocols to transmit and receive data from the device to the app and vice-versa. Any data stored within the device itself is encrypted as well.</div>
<div style=""background-color: #def0f8; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 3px;"">
<b>I’ve heard that using mobile phones can negatively affect health, is Ecoh safe for my child?</b> </div>
<div style=""padding: 0px 0px 20px 0px;"">
        Ecoh is absolutely safe for anybody! We’ve taken every step possible to ensure that there are no health concerns associated with using Ecoh. We have our own children, and if we wouldn’t let our children use Ecoh, we certainly wouldn’t let yours. Moreover, Ecoh will meet and surpass the strictest regulations in the world and be certified safe before your shipment arrives.</div>

Introducing Ecoh


Ecoh is a smart wearable communication and safety device designed specifically for use by children and the elderly. That means anyone can use it. Ecoh features a HD video camera, easy to use speed dial buttons, Bluetooth connection, WIFI, and a GPS locator, to ensure that your loved ones are always safe.







See what they see with HD live view


Talk to your child, anytime - anywhere!


Set safe zones and paths


Proximity sensors for added security


Light weight, shockproof and waterproof



Simple 2-way communication

First and foremost, Ecoh is a mobile phone. Just simplified. There are no complicated menus to navigate with Ecoh. Just press one of the speed dial buttons, and that’s it. Pure, and simple communication.








Know where they are

Want to make sure your children are where they’re supposed to be? 
Using the Ecoh mobile app, your child’s real-time GPS location is only a button press away. You can even set up the device to send “ecoh’s” of where your child is, at intervals that suit you.





See what they see


Via the Ecoh mobile app, you will be able to remotely activate and access the live camera stream from your child’s Ecoh. You will effectively see the world through the eyes of your child. 
Parents can always identify potential hazards that await unsuspecting children. By being able to see your child’s immediate surroundings, you will be able to identify anything around them that could be dangerous, before they get into trouble.




E-Zones and E-Paths


Your child wants to go play at the park, but you have a full day of grocery shopping, and housework ahead of you. So do you make your child sit and watch TV, while you take care of business? Or let them go outside and play at the park across the street?
With Ecoh, you can set up safe zones which effectively keeps your children within areas which you have designated safe. If they try to leave the area, you will be immediately notified via your Ecoh mobile app.
Setting up safe zones can be done from anywhere too. So even if you’re stuck at work, and little Billy wants to go play at his friend Robbie’s house around the corner, you can set up an E-Path that he will take to walk there, and then an E-Zone to make sure he stays there, all from your office desk.
Kids can get back to playing outside and running around at parks, just like they used to. The world outside is safer with Ecoh.





Security that's child proof


Ecoh comes with proximity sensors that can be worn on your kid's wrist, or attached to their shoe laces. If for any reason the Ecoh is out of range of the sensors, an alarm will sound and you will be notified on your smart phone.
From the outset, our goal was to produce a reliable, wearable device for children. Kids have a habit of breaking stuff, so we made sure Ecoh will handle anything a child can throw at it. Protected from dust and dirt penetration, Ecoh can even be submerged in up to 3 feet of water for a short time, and still remain operational.





HD camera and HQ microphone







We designed Ecoh to be as simple to use as possible. The app was no exception. Using the app dashboard, you will be able to easily configure your Ecoh device. You will also be able to select functions, and change the way the app works by customizing a number of options and features within the app dashboard itself.










With your support, our team will be able to fund our tooling and verification phase, which will see us go into production and ship your Ecoh by August 2015

1. General (Buying, Ecoh calling) 

How many Ecoh devices do I need? 

        We recommend having one per child. You will be able to configure and tether all of your Ecoh devices securely to the one smart phone app on your mobile device.

Can I buy one for my elderly parent? 

        Sure! You can buy Ecoh for anyone. Ecoh is not limited to just keeping children safe. It is aimed at simplifying communication and making sure that the people you love most, are always safe, no matter how old they are.

Can anyone setup Ecoh? 

        You betcha! You simply take your new Ecoh out of the box, insert your Nano SIM card, download the app to your mobile device and pair your Ecoh with the app, and you're ready to go!

How do I pair the Ecoh with my phone or tablet? 

    Pairing the device is as simple as scanning a unique QR code that’s supplied with your new Ecoh. Just to make sure you don’t have any trouble, the mobile app will guide you through the simple procedure, step by step.

What happens if my child tries to call me, but can’t get through? 

        (1) First Ecoh will try the other assigned speed dial phone number. 

(2) If that number cannot be reached either, Ecoh will automatically begin to redial the two programmed speed dial numbers up to 9 times (The number of re-dial attempts can be tailored in the app settings from 0-9 attempts). 

(3) If it's still unsuccessful in making a connection to the guardians phone numbers, Ecoh will go into what we call “dynamic black box” mode and begin recording and saving all available data, such as video, audio, and GPS location co-ordinates. Ecoh will also attempt to re-dial the guardians’ phones every few minutes, and once a connection has been established, all saved data can be transmitted to the guardians’ mobile device. 

(4) If no connection has been made after a user defined interval (between 0 – 15 minutes),Ecoh will begin to automatically dial secondary phone numbers in sequence until a connection is made. This feature is activated within the app and is customizable. Where no connection to any of the primary or secondary numbers can be made, Ecoh can be programmed to automatically dial emergency services numbers, like 911, 112, or 000. The user can set up Ecoh to automatically call emergency services if a number of triggers are met. For instance, if the child rapidly departs an E-Zone, a significant impact is detected by the shock sensors, or the Ecoh is separated from the child beyond a predetermined period of time. This feature is fully customizable, and can be switched off or enabled via the app.

Can my child dial Emergency services direct? 

        Yes! Emergency numbers must be programmed into the Ecoh device during the initial set up procedure before first use. To dial Emergency services, the child must hold down the two speed-dial buttons for at least 5 seconds. This will activate an outgoing emergency services call. This feature can be switched off or enabled via the app.

What happens if my phone dies? 

        If a paired phone dies, the user will be required to de-register the dead phone, and register an alternative or new device before it can be tethered to the Ecoh. 
If a tethered mobile device's battery dies, the user won't be able to monitor the Ecoh unless they have access to another tethered mobile device, or their PC or Mac is running the Ecoh application Software.

I'd like to store many phone numbers into my Ecoh, is this possible, and if so, how do I go about dialing those numbers? 

        When activated, Ecoh will be able to initiate outgoing calls via voice actuation. This means you can store as many phone numbers as you’d like into your Ecoh, and call any one of them easily. To actuate voice dialing, the user taps both speed dial buttons twice in quick succession, at which point Ecoh will beep and all LED’s will light up green, prompting you to say “Call (Name)”. Ecoh will then dial the appropriate phone number. To end the call, double tap both speed dial buttons, and the call is ended.

2. Buying & Shipping (Shipping costs, Estimated delivery) 

What are the shipping costs? 

        *Shipping is free worldwide for a limited time only. Shipping does not include any extra fees you may incur such as customs or taxes associated with your country or state.

How soon can I get Ecoh? 

        The estimated shipping date for Ecoh begins in August 2015.
￪ Back to FAQ



3. Privacy & Security (Switching off Ecoh, Health concerns) 

Can the device be switched off by anyone? 

        No. To switch your Ecoh off, the device and the paired mobile app must be within 2 meters of each other. This is a security measure we’ve implemented to ensure nobody can bypass the system by simply switching Ecoh off.

How secure is Ecoh? 

        Security was paramount when we were developing Ecoh, so we have used the latest secure data transferring methods/protocols to transmit and receive data from the device to the app and vice-versa. Any data stored within the device itself is encrypted as well.

I’ve heard that using mobile phones can negatively affect health, is Ecoh safe for my child? 

        Ecoh is absolutely safe for anybody! We’ve taken every step possible to ensure that there are no health concerns associated with using Ecoh. We have our own children, and if we wouldn’t let our children use Ecoh, we certainly wouldn’t let yours. Moreover, Ecoh will meet and surpass the strictest regulations in the world and be certified safe before your shipment arrives.

4. Technical (Connectivity, battery info, App with multiple Ecoh's) 

Can multiple mobile devices have the app running at the same time? 

       Yes, the free app will be available for iOS, Android, and Windows mobile phones, and can be used simultaneously by 2 mobile devices. We’ve restricted the number of mobile devices that can be tethered to any Ecoh as a security measure. If you upgrade your mobile device, or lose your current one, you can de-register the old or lost tethered device, and register and tether your new one.

Can I have multiple Ecoh’s on the one app? 

        Sure. You are able to tether as many Ecoh devices to the app as you like. For example, if you have 4 children, you can view all 4 Ecoh’s on the one app.

Does a SIM card come with the device? 

        No, Ecoh uses a Nano SIM card (prepaid or post-paid) preferably enabled with 3G or 4G(LTE), which you are able to purchase from any local retailer. Once you have purchased the SIM card, you simply insert it in the SIM card slot, and you’re ready to go!

Can I use Ecoh with a 2G only SIM? 

        Yes, but you won’t be able to use the advanced features, and will be limited to voice calls only.

How long will the battery last? 

       On a single charge, the battery will last over 50 hours. We are working hard to optimize power consumption and improve the battery life of the device even further.

Without a screen interface, how will I know the battery level of my Ecoh? 

       Your app will show the live status of the battery level of your Ecoh, and the device itself has LED indicators which show charge levels in increments of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. A charge level of under 10% will be indicated by a single red led on your Ecoh, and a low battery warning will be displayed on the app.

Is Ecoh water resistant? 

       Yes! Ecoh will meet the IP67 standard, which means it’s protected against the effects of immersion in water to a depth of up to 1 meter. Furthermore it’s completely dust proof too.

</p><p><b>Background Info:</b></p><p>Teraab has been tumbling and walking on
 his hands since he was 4 years old. I saw his talent but knew the 
expenses of gymnastics were completely outside of my budget.  While I 
knew I was limiting his options, I didn't see any other way.  This was 
when he was about 7.  Fast forward four and a half years.  </p><p>It's the summer 
of 2011. Teraab was tumbling and having fun with Streb Lab for Action Mechanics which is located in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, NY.  Teraab had been attending Streb's monthly First Friday Teen event for several months. During these events, Ashley, one of the coaches, saw 
the power, skill and grace that Teraab possessed and strongly urged me 
to find a gymnastics team and get him on it!  Stressed, I took him to 
Chelsea Piers the next day and over the course of the next week he 
auditioned in front of 3 coaches.  The end result? He was asked to join 
the Boys'Team at Chelsea Piers! They told me he was a natural (he has a 
six-pack you wouldn't believe).</p><p>Initially, Teraab was not given a scholarship at Chelsea Piers but after six months, that changed.  The Chelsea Piers Scholarship Committee 
granted Teraab partial scholarships for the 2012-2013 and the 2013-2014 
seasons.  For the upcoming 2014-2015 season, the Chelsea Piers 
scholarship amount has been reduced drastically making it difficult for 
me, a single mother with two other children, to make Teraab's gymnastic 
dreams a reality.</p><p>Chelsea Piers is a sports facility located in New York City.  It has a full range of sports activities housed within it.  It is located along the Hudson River Park on 23rd Street and 12th Avenue.  <a href=""http://www.chelseapiers.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.chelseapiers.com/</a></p><p><b>Current Highlights</b>:</p><p>In the past two

<p>LanDan Olivia lives in extreme pain.

<h3>Introducing: <strong>The CùShield, </strong>
</h3>
<h3>Let's Make Tomorrow Safer, Today</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>The Challenge</strong></h3>
<p>Our story starts when the world as we know it changed.  With the advent of the recent global pandemic the demand for PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) skyrocketed.  We saw the struggle to find, use, and dispose of traditional pieces of PPE.</p>
<p>Masks help to address airborne transmission, but are only half of the solution.  Transmission by touch/surface contamination remains a significant concern.  However, apart from harsh chemicals or intense UV light, the only protection from this threat came in the form of single-use, disposable, or consumable products....until now.</p>
<p>We at CùShield saw the need for something better.  Something easier to use.  Something more environmentally sustainable.  Something safer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>The Solution</strong></h3>
<p>Harnessing the amazing properties of Copper, we set out to develop a line of products that could be used in our daily lives.  We knew that these products would have to be intuitive to use, easy to carry, reusable, and above all safe.</p>
<p>After extensive development we are proud to present our Every Day Safety (EDS) line of personal protective products.</p>
<p>These are the patent pending CùShield <strong>Stylus</strong>, CùShield <strong>Handkerchief</strong>, and CùShield <strong>Pouch</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>And Jay King | <a href=""https://www.Jays.me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Jays.me</a> - the other half and partner with CuShieldUSA. With a background as a successful entrepreneur, inventor, innovator and business specialist for over a decade, Jay and Doug immediately became compatible, hence... the CuShield, and are making their way to other products, inventions and innovations for the world to embrace, in addition to everything they have done thus far. </p>
<p><i>We've all been through a lot, but our world and our lives must move forward.  With your support, CùShield is here to help make that path safer for all.</i></p>

<h3><strong>The Technology</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590461322/wpplmzrmu4tqeuuh4t8w.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The secret to our technology is right in our name, Cu.  Copper is legendary for its anti-microbial properties.  </p>
<p>Modern science has repeatedly demonstrated copper's unique ability to destroy biological contaminants, yet remain safe for everyday use.  </p>
<h3><strong>The Science</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590694929/pzgdrymlnjohsckiqgvd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While copper can destroy many biological contaminants upon contact, some contagions persist for a short time before being rendered inactive.  <strong>This is where other products on the market fall short, as their contact surfaces are left exposed</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>unique</strong>, and <strong>proprietary designs</strong> of the CùShield EDS products protect the user from the copper contact surfaces, eliminating possible contamination and allowing the copper to do its job.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Support comes in many forms, and we appreciate them all.  </p>
<p>So please, if you like what we're doing here...spread the word, visit us on our social media pages, like us, and share. If you are unable to pledge, please help us by simply sharing this on your social media! That is a great pledge to us as well! Thank You!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From all of us at CùShield,</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I order CùShield​ products in larger quantities?</strong></p>
<p>You bet!  Please contact us directly for more information.</p>
<p><strong>Are CùShield products available for licensing or custom promotional applications?</strong></p>
<p>We'd love to work with you in any way we can to get CùShield EDS products in the hands of your customers.  Please contact us directly to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>There are rubber gloves, wipes, sanitizer, and other “no-touch” devices on the market…why CùShield</strong>?</p>
<p>Unique:  Our designs and products are superior to other options on he market because they not only help to combat the spread of contagions (unlike rubber gloves), its active component never runs out (like wipes and sanitizer), and they protect you from the contact surfaces when not in use (unlike other “key” products).</p>
<p>Proprietary:  Our designs are Patent Pending, and are on file in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.</p>
<p>Made in the USA:  Local manufacturing allows us to bring you a superior product at a great price.</p>
<p><strong>How does it all work?</strong></p>
<p>In short, Copper.  Copper is known to possess potent anti-microbial properties often killing biological contaminants on contact, and in some cases within hours.  We use 99.9+% copper for the contact surfaces of our products to ensure maximum activity.<br/>But don't take our word for it, check out the articles below:<br/><a href=""http://www.insider.com/does-copper-kill-germs-and-viruses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.insider.com/does-copper-kill-germs-and-viruses</a><br/><a href=""http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/copper-virus-kill-180974655/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/copper-vi...</a><br/><a href=""https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jam.13681"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/do...</a></p>
<p>Despite the overwhelming research regarding copper's abilities and properties, strict regulations exist defining what product attributes may be claimed.  Accordingly, please note that we are not making any <i>specific</i> claims that the CùShield EDS product line will cure, treat, or prevent anyone from being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or any other pathogen.</p>
<p><strong>What's with the thing over the “u”?</strong></p>
<p>CùShield is ultimately about one thing, protection. This is something we wanted to emphasize with our name and logo. The shield is self-explanatory, as is the Cu (the atomic symbol for copper), but we wanted something extra to drive home the idea. Cù comes from the Scottish Gaelic for dog or hound, mankind's everpresent companion and protector....just like CùShield.</p>
<p><strong>Can I and how do I clean my CùShield​ products?</strong></p>
<p>While the copper used in our Every Day Safety personal protective takes care of itself, your CùShield products can be cleaned much like any other personal accessory.  We recommend hand-washing only, though sanitizer may be used as well.</p>
<p>Like any copper item, the contact surfaces may develop a patina over time and with use. This does not impact or degrade its protective abilities.  Mild abrasives or copper polishes may be used on the Stylus if you would like to restore its factory appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Will COVID affect production?</strong></p>
<p>Thus far COVID-19 has had not affected our production. All of our US production facilities are working in full force. We don't foresee any delays due to the corona virus.</p>
<p><strong>Will the delivered products be exactly like the ones pictured?</strong></p>
<p>Not necessarily; they will be even better. We are always looking to optimize our products and reserve the right to make modifications in the interest of making your CùShield EDS products even better. Our initial production runs were awesome, but we always are striving for better.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to offer upgrades?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have some awesome ideas for stretch goals. When the campaign reaches a certain funding amount we’ll unlock these upgrades! Tell your friends about CùShield and we'll all get there faster!</p>
<p><strong>Is there a warranty?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! We use on the highest quality material and construction, and we stand behind our products. All CùShield products are warranted for 30 days from receipt to be free from manufacturing defects. If you need any support after that you can reach our US Based support team by phone or email.</p>
<p><strong>Do you offer worldwide shipping?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we offer shipping for all countries.</p>
<p><strong>How much is Shipping?</strong></p>
<p>Please refer to the individual perks for shipping information.</p>
<p><strong>Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT?</strong></p>
<p>The backer is responsible for all duties and taxes, please check your country's import duties before purchasing. CùShield products ship from the United States.</p>

After extensive development we are proud to present our Every Day Safety (EDS) line of personal protective products.
These are the patent pending CùShield Stylus, CùShield Handkerchief, and CùShield Pouch.

 

The Team 
Founder of CùShield, and inventor of its flagship products, Douglas McGregor is a career engineer, product developer, and life-long creator.  With a background in Chemical Engineering and 20 years in manufacturing with multiple Fortune 500 companies, Douglas has a passion for innovation and bringing new ideas to market.
 

 
And Jay King | www.Jays.me - the other half and partner with CuShieldUSA. With a background as a successful entrepreneur, inventor, innovator and business specialist for over a decade, Jay and Doug immediately became compatible, hence... the CuShield, and are making their way to other products, inventions and innovations for the world to embrace, in addition to everything they have done thus far. 
We've all been through a lot, but our world and our lives must move forward.  With your support, CùShield is here to help make that path safer for all.
 

The Technology

The secret to our technology is right in our name, Cu.  Copper is legendary for its anti-microbial properties.  
Modern science has repeatedly demonstrated copper's unique ability to destroy biological contaminants, yet remain safe for everyday use.  
The Science

 
While copper can destroy many biological contaminants upon contact, some contagions persist for a short time before being rendered inactive.  This is where other products on the market fall short, as their contact surfaces are left exposed.
The unique, and proprietary designs of the CùShield EDS products protect the user from the copper contact surfaces, eliminating possible contamination and allowing the copper to do its job.


 
Now it's time...
 


 
Now, Let's Compare Visually
 

 


 


 
Your Contribution
We are asking for your support to raise $5,000.  Our supply chain is set, our materials are sourced and our factories are waiting to begin, but we need your help to set it all in motion.
Your contributions will allow us to purchase our raw materials in cost effective quantities, and in turn help bring our Every Day Safety products to more people.
Why Flexible Funding?
We've worked hard to source our materials, select our manufacturing partners, and design our products to allow for the most cost effective production possible. 
This isn't just good business, it ensures that regardless of our campaign's outcome we will get our products to where they'll do the most good...in the hands of our backers. 


While we hope to share our Every Day Safety products with the world, we also want to support businesses here at home.  When you support CùShield know that your support doesn't end with us, as we proudly manufacture our products here in the USA. 
As an added bonus, sourcing materials and production locally means that we can be present for every step of the manufacturing process in order to ensure unparalleled quality. 
 
Production Phase
We have begun!
Production has been a wild ride, and we need your help to continue.  Your contribution will help us expand our capabilities so that we can bring CùShield products to the world...giving everyone the tools to conquer what comes next.

From all of us at CùShield,
Thank you.
 
 
Can I order CùShield​ products in larger quantities?
You bet!  Please contact us directly for more information.
Are CùShield products available for licensing or custom promotional applications?
We'd love to work with you in any way we can to get CùShield EDS products in the hands of your customers.  Please contact us directly to discuss.
There are rubber gloves, wipes, sanitizer, and other “no-touch” devices on the market…why CùShield?
Unique:  Our designs and products are superior to other options on he market because they not only help to combat the spread of contagions (unlike rubber gloves), its active component never runs out (like wipes and sanitizer), and they protect you from the contact surfaces when not in use (unlike other “key” products).
Proprietary:  Our designs are Patent Pending, and are on file in the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Made in the USA:  Local manufacturing allows us to bring you a superior product at a great price.
How does it all work?
In short, Copper.  Copper is known to possess potent anti-microbial properties often killing biological contaminants on contact, and in some cases within hours.  We use 99.9+% copper for the contact surfaces of our products to ensure maximum activity.But don't take our word for it, check out the articles below:www.insider.com/does-copper-kill-germs-and-viruseswww.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/copper-vi...https://sfamjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/do...
Despite the overwhelming research regarding copper's abilities and properties, strict regulations exist defining what product attributes may be claimed.  Accordingly, please note that we are not making any specific claims that the CùShield EDS product line will cure, treat, or prevent anyone from being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus or any other pathogen.
What's with the thing over the “u”?
CùShield is ultimately about one thing, protection. This is something we wanted to emphasize with our name and logo. The shield is self-explanatory, as is the Cu (the atomic symbol for copper), but we wanted something extra to drive home the idea. Cù comes from the Scottish Gaelic for dog or hound, mankind's everpresent companion and protector....just like CùShield.
Can I and how do I clean my CùShield​ products?
While the copper used in our Every Day Safety personal protective takes care of itself, your CùShield products can be cleaned much like any other personal accessory.  We recommend hand-washing only, though sanitizer may be used as well.
Like any copper item, the contact surfaces may develop a patina over time and with use. This does not impact or degrade its protective abilities.  Mild abrasives or copper polishes may be used on the Stylus if you would like to restore its factory appearance.
Will COVID affect production?
Thus far COVID-19 has had not affected our production. All of our US production facilities are working in full force. We don't foresee any delays due to the corona virus.
Will the delivered products be exactly like the ones pictured?
Not necessarily; they will be even better. We are always looking to optimize our products and reserve the right to make modifications in the interest of making your CùShield EDS products even better. Our initial production runs were awesome, but we always are striving for better.
Are you planning to offer upgrades?
Yes, we have some awesome ideas for stretch goals. When the campaign reaches a certain funding amount we’ll unlock these upgrades! Tell your friends about CùShield and we'll all get there faster!
Is there a warranty?
Yes! We use on the highest quality material and construction, and we stand behind our products. All CùShield products are warranted for 30 days from receipt to be free from manufacturing defects. If you need any support after that you can reach our US Based support team by phone or email.
Do you offer worldwide shipping?
Yes, we offer shipping for all countries.
How much is Shipping?
Please refer to the individual perks for shipping information.
Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT?
The backer is responsible for all duties and taxes, please check your country's import duties before purchasing. CùShield products ship from the United States.",12.0,6,"1 Campaign

WebMD reports that 23% of people aged 18 to 65 are affected.  Treatment for this hidden epidemic are tentative at best and costly. Surgery comes in at upwards of $8,000. There is no guarantee of pain relief. Immobilisation is required for weeks and pain is very high.  Hallux Valgus and bunions return in 15% of cases.Custom orthotics distribute the foot load at a cost of $600 every three years. I personally benefitted from them, however the hallux valgus itself progressed and so did pain. Splints also exist, and none of them could give me relief. I made my own since 1996. I still woke at night from pressure points, rashes etc…Still they helped me to go to sleep at first, but woke me later. Join me to change Hallux Valgus outcome for countless people working on their feet.It will mean:
Amitoe will be proposed as a viable treatment option to sufferers, by General Practitioners and Podiatrists alike.
Trials sufficiently large will prove the preventative benefits. 
We will gain TGA approval
Young sufferers will realise it is actually genetic and complications can be averted
Together we can enhance the quality of life of many people and prevent early onset of a sedentary life style for countless others

Hygiene. Style.NitraPro is a protein shaker, unlike any other protein shaker. With design on our mind, we introduce to you the most durable, hygienic and stylish shaker ever.Back this project and smell the success, not the build-up of bacteria.   
 

  
 
 
 
 

 
Keep it clean and avoid bad smells. Have you ever forgotten to clean your shaker after a workout and opened it hours later just to be horrified by that pungent smell? Not only is this an unpleasant feeling but you’re also experiencing the build-up of bacteria taking over your bottle. We designed the NitraPro bottle to put an end to this. Our 100% hygienic kitchen-grade stainless steel bottle prevents bacteria build-up, is easy to clean and doesn’t absorb those nasty odors.   
High quality, 100% BPA free. All the materials we use are of the highest quality to ensure your shaker remains odor-free and the taste is not affected. We only use 100% BPA free, food-grade certified materials making NitraPro the most hygienic shaker ever. 
 
 Wanna stay cool…or hot? Keep your drink at its original temperature for up to 12 hours with the double-walled insulation. That sweat caused by condensation won’t be an issue. You’ll be the only one sweating after a successful workout and ready to enjoy a drink at its perfect temperature in or out of the gym.  
 
 
 No moving parts for maximum efficiency.Tired of attracting attention when you shake your bottle? Get a smooth, clump-free protein shake every time. The parts in our bottle fit perfectly together, making the smoothest shake, silently and effortlessly. No one will hear, try it yourself! 
 
 
 
 Twist cap to prevent leakage.   Have you ever opened your bag only to find everything inside drenched by your drink? Many bottles leak and sweat, ours has been engineered to fit your active lifestyle. No matter how you place your bottle, the BPA free twist cap is extra tight, so your drink stays in the bottle, where it belongs. 
 
 
 
A bottle made to last you a lifetime. We need to take care of our planet and sustainability is our main concern. Instead of wasting your money on low-quality shakers, save your money and the planet. NitraPro is made of only the highest quality materials used in professional kitchens worldwide made to last and withstand the test of time.Unlike plastic bottles, no chemicals will get into your drink. Choose the best for yourself and our planet. 
 
 
 
 Not into protein shakes? No problem! Our shaker is capable of much more than just blending protein. It adapts to your lifestyle. You can store your hot and cold drinks, and the agitator doubles as a fruit infuser or ice holder. Enjoy coffee, tea, water, smoothies or even a cheeky cocktail in your stylish bottle created not only for the gym.Take your NitraPro bottle anywhere you go. Its sleek design fits in all standard size cup holders. The silicone strap was created for a comfortable grip with the possibility to attach your bottle to anything.",36.0,0,"1 Campaign

mother who does not need or deserve to have her own personal assistant? How
about an <b>I</b>ntelligent <b>P</b>ersonal <b>A</b>ssistant? DoulaRoom assist mothers from conception to age 3, and soon to be age 6. We all know how serious a job it is to be a mother, but
how about adding some fun. </p>
<h4><b>So what is a Doula?</b></h4>
<p>A Doula is someone who provides
support to a mother and her family during pregnancy and into
parenting. (Can I please have two!)</p>
<p>So what have we built for mothers?
Our global team of medical and technical experts have spent the last two years
building and piloting a mobile app. The app is integrated with a
wireless activity band, wireless mother baby weight scale, and a wireless blood
pressure monitor to help the mother easily track activities that are critical
to her health and that of her baby. </p>
<p>DoulaRoom is far more than a mobile
app, it is an <b>I</b>ntelligent <b>P</b>ersonal <b>A</b>ssistant, <b>IPA</b>. It supports the mother, her family and medical
providers from conception to age three. We are already extending the <b>IPA</b> to support the family to age six
and will continue extending it through tween and teen.  </p>
<h4><b>Hey Siri …</b></h4>
<p>We think if Siri got pregnant or
had a family; this is what she would use (Apple, if Siri reproduces we will
give you a DoulaRoom <b>IPA</b> and a Mother
Bundle).</p>
<p>DoulaRoom is designed to <b>Inform, Support and Empower</b> the mother
with trusted <b>Information</b>, the <span>ability to communicate how and when
she needs <b>Support </b>and to <b>Empower </b>her with the knowledge to participate
in decisions that are in the best interest of her and her family.  </span></p>

<p>We have added a journal and photo
gallery to record the pregnancy and parenting journey (whoever said, it is the
journey and not the destination that is the real adventure did not have swollen
feet or walk around with baby food on their shoulder without knowing). We are
adding the ability to create a baby book starting from the
earliest days of pregnancy using the journal and photo gallery. </p>
<p>And as added fun: During pregnancy there are only a few times, in the
doctor’s office, that baby’s heartbeat can be heard.<span> Now with our DoulaRoom Fetal Doppler, a mother can
record the sound of her baby’s heartbeat in the IPA and share it with anyone,
anywhere. The doppler also records the heart rate, which can be shared with her
medical team.</span></p>

for Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment in Africa</b> . The ASCP-led coalition
provides rapid cancer diagnostics, care, and treatment to underserved areas in
Sub-Saharan Africa. They believe timely diagnostic services can reduce up to 80% of the
cancer disease burden.</p>
<p>In meeting with
their CEO and senior team we discussed how extending our <b>I</b>ntelligent <b>P</b>ersonal
<b>A</b>ssistant could provide mothers with cancer education, prevention, early
detection and treatment monitoring for herself and her family. Since DoulaRoom
was created to help mothers and their families on a global basis, we jumped at
the opportunity to support this ASCP initiative and in our small way join the
fight against cancer. We were humbled by their compliments about our IPA and
excited to start building a collaborative vision to benefit mothers and their
families globally. </p>
<p><b>Our Commitment to mothers everywhere!</b></p><p>To demonstrate
our commitment, we will be using our Indiegogo DoulaRoom Angelfund to support the building and delivery of cancer

<p>What
are some of the activities that are important to Mother &amp; Baby?</p>
<p>1. Monitoring <b>Weight
Gain</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455934105/q8bvhptlir2cszuwwcgu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Eating for
Two?</b> Current
studies show that too much weight gain during pregnancy could be dangerous to
the mother and baby. Too little weight gain can also be harmful. WOW! Do you
know what your optimal weight gain is week by week? How do you track it? The
DoulaRoom IPA and wireless scale will chart your progress daily.</p>
<p>2. Taking <b>Blood
Pressure</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455934143/crvjzwzoueohu2wb4xvb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>Under
Pressure?</b>  So, you
have never had a problem with blood pressure why worry now? Many women start
out with normal blood pressure but then have it rise during pregnancy.
Increased blood pressure could lead to decreased oxygen to the placenta and to
the baby, which could lead to decreased growth and brain development in the
baby. The DoulaRoom IPA and wireless blood pressure monitor helps you track and
record your blood pressure daily or as recommended by your medical provider. We
are making it easy for you.</p>
<p>3. Tracking<b> Water
Intake</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455934168/tzpwomorko8ltnrvzzm2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>Cheers!</b> Most studies and experts agree
that expectant mothers should drink 6-8 glasses of water a day. Why? Too little
water could lead to blood clots or urinary tractinfections.
Later in pregnancy it could lead to cramping and false labor. It is also very
important for women experiencing nausea to have adequate water intake.

<p><b>What is a
Doula? </b></p>
<p>A Doula is a non-medical
person who provides emotional and physical support to a woman and her family
before, during and after a child is born. The assistance of a Doula is often
associated with improved maternal and fetal health. A Doula performs no medical
duties or decision-making, deferring instead to nurses, midwives, and doctors.</p>
<p><b>What is
DoulaRoom? </b></p>
<p>DoulaRoom is
a mobile <b>I</b>ntelligent <b>P</b>ersonal <b>A</b>ssistant for mothers and their families. It provides current
online resources, which empowers the mother to be an active and informed
collaborator in her healthcare during her pregnancy and into parenting. As
well, it enables her to share her physical and emotional journey with her
support circle, regardless of their geographic location. DoulaRoom, like
a Doula, performs no medical duties or decision-making, deferring instead
to nurses, midwives, and doctors. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can
DoulaRoom work with the integrated devices on iOS and Android?</b></p>
<p>DoulaRoom is
designed to work on both the Android and iOS operating systems. Both phone and
tablets are supported. The seamless integration of the wireless blood pressure
monitor, wireless weight scale and wireless activity band require the phone or
tablet to be compatible with Bluetooth 4.0 standards. Most current phones and
tablets support this. To make it easier for you we have added the link below
where you can check for compatibility. Even if your phone or tablet are of an
older version we have made it so you can manually input all the device
information and still benefit from the features to Inform, Support and Empower you. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>What do I
do with the DoulaRoom devices after I have my baby?</b></p>
<p>Your personal
health is just as important to you, your family and your newborn after you
deliver as it was during your pregnancy. Our medical team’s advice is to
continue to using the wireless weight scale, wireless blood pressure monitor
and wireless activity band to help manage your health. If you are not planning
to have any more pregnancies you could gift or sell the fetal doppler.</p>
<p><b>Is
DoulaRoom a medical app or a technology app?</b></p>
<p>Neither.
DoulaRoom is designed to provide a better way for mothers to be informed and empowered
during their pregnancies and into parenting. Not all pregnancies are at risk
but; wouldn’t it be nice to know what the important things like blood pressure
and fetal heart rate are on a daily basis? This is not about technology.
Technology is being leveraged to keep the mother informed with trusted sources
of information and to help her circle of care be there to support her
regardless of geographic boundaries.</p>
<p><b>Does my
midwife, doctor, or care teams have to sign up? What if I do not want to share

<p>The DoulaRoom
<b>I</b>ntelligent <b>P</b>ersonal <b>A</b>ssistant
provides benefits to the mother independent of her medical care team. It is her
choice who she wants to bring into her circle of care. If a midwife, doctor,
clinic, or hospital sign up and download the DoulaRoom provider app, the mother
can invite them to join her circle. Our goal is to bring together a mother and
her circle of care to provide a better supportive experience.  </p>

<p><b>How can
this help women in developing countries?</b></p>
<p>While most
developing countries have a shortage of medical support, they commonly
have extensive mobile network coverage. Our goal is to work with local
governments and agencies to help identify which mothers are at risk so they can
be prioritized and the scarce medical resources can be utilized where they are needed
most. </p>
<h3><b>Risks and Challenges</b></h3>
<p>As you know
we are on a mission to Inform, Support and Empower women worldwide throughout
their parenting journey. You have now heard that our company philosophy is
based on three pillars: </p>
<p>1) Provide
trusted and current medical information</p>
<p>2) Leverage
and integrate the best technology </p>
<p>3) Listen to
you, so we can work together to continuously improve the IPA to support mothers
globally.</p>
<p>Let’s start
with how we are dealing with thechallenges,
which could impact delivering the IPA on time and staying true to our
philosophy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>1) PROVIDE THE BEST AND MOST CURRENT MEDICAL
INFORMATION </b></p>
<p>We have a
team of medical professionals who have and will continue to search for current
and reliable sources of information and research. When we provide information
in DoulaRoom we supply credits and references for further reading from the
source.</p>
<p><b>2) LEVERAGE AND INTEGRATE THE BEST
TECHNOLOGY </b></p>
<p>One of our
early and most strategic decisions was to partner with <span>IBM
for the development, integration and operation. This was a critical
decision for DoulaRoom and we are delighted with the support and commitment we
have received in this partnership. We are running our business in their secure cloud
environment. This gives us the confidence for scalability, availability and
privacy to take this IPA to the world. Working with IBM we will be able to Inform,
Support, and Empower mothers around the world. </span></p>
<p>The DoulaRoom
IPA runs on Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems. We have worked
directly with our device manufacturers to build devices, which meet our
specifications of integration, quality and ease of use. The manufacturers we
have partnered with are focused on the medical industry, which means they know
the importance of quality. </p>
<p><b>3) LISTEN TO YOU</b>, so we can work together to continue to improve
the IPA and support mothers globally. </p>
<p>We already
have the DoulaRoom <b>I</b>ntelligent <b>P</b>ersonal <b>A</b>ssistant in use by mothers, but we need your help to use the <b>IPA</b> and tell us how to make it better.
We are very confident from feedback that it will make a difference in your
life. Our entire team is committed to deliver the best mobile experience to
support mothers everywhere.</p>

</div></div>","Is there a
mother who does not need or deserve to have her own personal assistant? How
about an Intelligent Personal Assistant? DoulaRoom assist mothers from conception to age 3, and soon to be age 6. We all know how serious a job it is to be a mother, but
how about adding some fun. 
So what is a Doula?
A Doula is someone who provides
support to a mother and her family during pregnancy and into
parenting. (Can I please have two!)
So what have we built for mothers?
Our global team of medical and technical experts have spent the last two years
building and piloting a mobile app. The app is integrated with a
wireless activity band, wireless mother baby weight scale, and a wireless blood
pressure monitor to help the mother easily track activities that are critical
to her health and that of her baby. 
DoulaRoom is far more than a mobile
app, it is an Intelligent Personal Assistant, IPA. It supports the mother, her family and medical
providers from conception to age three. We are already extending the IPA to support the family to age six
and will continue extending it through tween and teen.  
Hey Siri …
We think if Siri got pregnant or
had a family; this is what she would use (Apple, if Siri reproduces we will
give you a DoulaRoom IPA and a Mother
Bundle).
DoulaRoom is designed to Inform, Support and Empower the mother
with trusted Information, the ability to communicate how and when
she needs Support and to Empower her with the knowledge to participate
in decisions that are in the best interest of her and her family.  
DoulaRoom was designed to Inform, Support and Empower a Mother. We believe that the responsibility a mother carries deservers our supportSo where is the fun?
We have added a journal and photo
gallery to record the pregnancy and parenting journey (whoever said, it is the
journey and not the destination that is the real adventure did not have swollen
feet or walk around with baby food on their shoulder without knowing). We are
adding the ability to create a baby book starting from the
earliest days of pregnancy using the journal and photo gallery. 
And as added fun: During pregnancy there are only a few times, in the
doctor’s office, that baby’s heartbeat can be heard. Now with our DoulaRoom Fetal Doppler, a mother can
record the sound of her baby’s heartbeat in the IPA and share it with anyone,
anywhere. The doppler also records the heart rate, which can be shared with her
medical team.
An extra BONUS for our Indiegogo friends.


As an extra special to our Indiegogo
friends who are helping with
our pre launch …. You will receive the next version of our IPA at no
charge… a Cognitive Intelligent Personal Assistant.  We are using the IBM Watson super computer to
add cognitive capabilities to the IPA. When you join us on Indiegogo you will
be the first in the world to have Watson read your daily journal entries and
provide you with insight into how you are feeling with our DoulaRoom Mood Meter. 

Feel the LOVE, we guarantee it 

We have had such great feedback on the Intelligent Personal Assistant
and are so confident that you will love it; we are going to offer the first 25
people a guarantee of LOVE. If in 30 days you do not LOVE this IPA, send back
the mother bundle and we will refund your Perk $. No risk, only the offer of
loving it.
We think this is really important and exciting!We met with the American Society of Clinical Pathology who created Partners
for Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment in Africa . The ASCP-led coalition
provides rapid cancer diagnostics, care, and treatment to underserved areas in
Sub-Saharan Africa. They believe timely diagnostic services can reduce up to 80% of the
cancer disease burden.
In meeting with
their CEO and senior team we discussed how extending our Intelligent Personal
Assistant could provide mothers with cancer education, prevention, early
detection and treatment monitoring for herself and her family. Since DoulaRoom
was created to help mothers and their families on a global basis, we jumped at
the opportunity to support this ASCP initiative and in our small way join the
fight against cancer. We were humbled by their compliments about our IPA and
excited to start building a collaborative vision to benefit mothers and their
families globally. 
Our Commitment to mothers everywhere!To demonstrate
our commitment, we will be using our Indiegogo DoulaRoom Angelfund to support the building and delivery of cancer
education, prevention and treatment features to support the ASCP initiative.
Our vision is to include these features into our Intelligent Personal
Assistant so that mothers and their families will benefit on a global
scale.

What
are some of the activities that are important to Mother & Baby?
1. Monitoring Weight
Gain





Eating for
Two? Current
studies show that too much weight gain during pregnancy could be dangerous to
the mother and baby. Too little weight gain can also be harmful. WOW! Do you
know what your optimal weight gain is week by week? How do you track it? The
DoulaRoom IPA and wireless scale will chart your progress daily.
2. Taking Blood
Pressure




Under
Pressure?  So, you
have never had a problem with blood pressure why worry now? Many women start
out with normal blood pressure but then have it rise during pregnancy.
Increased blood pressure could lead to decreased oxygen to the placenta and to
the baby, which could lead to decreased growth and brain development in the
baby. The DoulaRoom IPA and wireless blood pressure monitor helps you track and
record your blood pressure daily or as recommended by your medical provider. We
are making it easy for you.
3. Tracking Water
Intake




Cheers! Most studies and experts agree
that expectant mothers should drink 6-8 glasses of water a day. Why? Too little
water could lead to blood clots or urinary tractinfections.
Later in pregnancy it could lead to cramping and false labor. It is also very
important for women experiencing nausea to have adequate water intake.
DoulaRoom makes it easy for you to track your daily water intake.
4.

which could impact delivering the IPA on time and staying true to our
philosophy.

1) PROVIDE THE BEST AND MOST CURRENT MEDICAL
INFORMATION 
We have a
team of medical professionals who have and will continue to search for current
and reliable sources of information and research. When we provide information
in DoulaRoom we supply credits and references for further reading from the
source.
2) LEVERAGE AND INTEGRATE THE BEST
TECHNOLOGY 
One of our
early and most strategic decisions was to partner with IBM
for the development, integration and operation. This was a critical
decision for DoulaRoom and we are delighted with the support and commitment we
have received in this partnership. We are running our business in their secure cloud
environment. This gives us the confidence for scalability, availability and
privacy to take this IPA to the world. Working with IBM we will be able to Inform,
Support, and Empower mothers around the world. 
The DoulaRoom
IPA runs on Apple iOS and Google Android operating systems. We have worked
directly with our device manufacturers to build devices, which meet our
specifications of integration, quality and ease of use. The manufacturers we
have partnered with are focused on the medical industry, which means they know
the importance of quality. 
3) LISTEN TO YOU, so we can work together to continue to improve
the IPA and support mothers globally. 
We already
have the DoulaRoom Intelligent Personal Assistant in use by mothers, but we need your help to use the IPA and tell us how to make it better.
We are very confident from feedback that it will make a difference in your
life. Our entire team is committed to deliver the best mobile experience to
support mothers everywhere.
    Other Ways You Can Help 

If you can
participate in our Perks, that is great and thank you, but even if you can not
we would ask for your help spreading the word. If everyone who reads this could repost this on your Facebook or other social media, or simply tell 5 friends you will be helping
us to build the best mobile experience to Inform, Support, and Empower mothers,
their families, friends and medical providers around the world. 
THANK
YOU, We appreciate your help!",27.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<div>It is estimated that <strong>800,000 Service members from the post-9/11 wars will experience post-deployment illness linked to war exposures</strong>; these illnesses are little acknowledged and poorly understood <a href=""http://www.sgtsullivancenter.org/veterans-heath-crisis-facts.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>physical health problems</strong></a> associated with <a href=""http://www.sgtsullivancenter.org/spotlight.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">theater exposures</a> that can lead to disability and death. However, many healthcare and supportive service organizations do not know that this substantial group of wounded warriors and their families exist, which leads to significant gaps in service and a sense of isolation for those suffering. <strong>You can help us change that. </strong>
</div>
<p>The Center works to fill these gaps by expanding public awareness of post-deployment illness and disseminating information about work being done to identify causes and remedies; and by promoting and providing support for scientific reseach and educational opportunities for healthcare providers, patients, and advocates.  </p>

The first symptom that appeared was bilateral hearing loss.  As is often the case, AJ's hearing aids were not covered by insurance and cost nearly $5,000 out of pocket. Throughout the past year she has developed other symptoms and complications including arthritis, neuropathy, loss of appetite, and several others. Her mobility is very limited, and she uses a wheelchair to get around. It has been a very difficult year thus far because of the cost of the diagnostics, doctor visits, and medication and there is still the cost of further testing, medication, and physical therapy.

<p>  My name is Jeff Rocheleau and I am an independent missionary who travels to Manado, Indonesia . I have been working with humanitarian missions for about a year on a volunteer basis, gathering supplies, and equipment for the various needs of the less fortunate in 3rd world countries. I recently went to Mando, Indonesia to see for myself what the need was there and got to meet a couple of very dedicated resident doctors. They took me on a tour of the only government hospital. They took me to the Emergency Department and I broke down. The reason I broke down is because they have very limited resources to treat the 100's of patients they see on a daily basis. They have an old suction machine from the 1970's that only works part of the time and they only have 1 patient monitor that works most of the time. As the tour moved forward into the treatment rooms, I saw how the patients were in all on old rusty beds. They were being treated with just basic first aid supplies. Because  of the lack of life saving equipment most people die there depending on their sickness. Here in America we are so lucky to have what we have here as far as medical. The conditions there would make you cry, because compared to the treatment we get here in the United States, they get next to nothing. There is so much need, its  hard to know where to start. I was told by one of the resident doctors that they use rice cookers to sterilize instruments. I want to change that and bring technology and the best supplies and equipment to this part of the world, but I can't do it alone. I need your help to help the doctors in Manado save more lives with the life saving equipment the campaign money will provide.The funding I am trying to raise is for better working life saving equipment and medical supplies. The funding will also help with gaining 501c3 Status(its pretty expensive), shipping the equipment and supplies over to Manado.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">OMNAs STORY</h3>The story of OMNA began in 2012 our founder was on a surf trip with friends. They took a boat across a river to get to an epic surf break and they ended up surfing until dark, which meant they had to paddle the river mouth back at night. The river was known for crocodiles and sharks, and it was prime feeding time. So they got into a tight group and paddled as fast as possible to the other side. Luckily, that night nothing happened, but it got him thinking. If something had happened there was no way to stop any bleeding, and get an injured person to the hospital alive.<p> </p>

<p>That is where the idea of <b>Water Sports Tourniquets</b> <i>(Tourniquet Leashes &amp; Amphibious Tourniquets)</i> was born!

<h3>Summary</h3>
<div>We are in the process of building the Danish National Lacrosse Team.<br/>We have been training, working hard and getting in shape to compete at the 2016 European Lacrosse Federation Championships in Hungary.<br/>Raising this money will go great distances in helping us with travel, uniform, and equipment costs.<br/>The tournament is hosted over a week in Hungary and will see 18 nations go head to head in the battle to be crowned Europe's best.<p></p>
<p>Since most of the guys on our team are students, they don't have much money for a trip like this. Lacrosse is a small sport in Denmark and we don't receive any form of public funding so the trip would be fully financed by the players themselves.</p>

Summary
We are in the process of building the Danish National Lacrosse Team.We have been training, working hard and getting in shape to compete at the 2016 European Lacrosse Federation Championships in Hungary.Raising this money will go great distances in helping us with travel, uniform, and equipment costs.The tournament is hosted over a week in Hungary and will see 18 nations go head to head in the battle to be crowned Europe's best.
Since most of the guys on our team are students, they don't have much money for a trip like this. Lacrosse is a small sport in Denmark and we don't receive any form of public funding so the trip would be fully financed by the players themselves.



What We Need & What You Get

We are looking to raise $5000 to help aid with the cost of equipment and national team uniforms.

If we reach our funding goals, the money will be used for equipment (helmets and gloves) and uniforms. 
If we exceed our goals, the excess money will be used towards team traveling costs.
The items you receive by funding our team include official Danish National Lacrosse Team merchandise - see below
Every one that has donated goes into the draw to win a Ripwood Lacrosse shaft with the Danish Lacrosse Federation logo burnt into the wood or one of two 6 packs of 'Midtbane' beer from MunkeboMikrobryg.









The Impact

 The Danish National Lacrosse Team program is run by volunteers and paid for by the team members themselves. A donation will help these volunteers and team members to become the first Danish National Lacrosse Team to compete internationally since 2010.



    Other Ways You Can Help We understand that some people can't contribute financially, but they can help us reach our goal by:

<p>It was a good day for the Calzada family. Unable to afford a computer for the kids, and with only one vehicle in the family, Jose Calzada found himself taking 2 kids to the library after work to use a computer for their homework. That was two hours a day, 4 days a week. 50 weeks a year. 50 weeks a year that a loving, caring father gave his kids. <br/>
</p>
<p>Those kids received a computer from Reglue just in time for Christmas last year. We give financially disadvantaged kids the computers they need. We put the technology into the hands that need it most. A computer that gave an over-worked dad a break. A computer that allows them to compete with their peers and ultimately; scholarships. That computer, along with hundreds of others have been delivered by our Ford Explorer delivery vehicle. <a href=""www.reglue.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><br/></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the repair cost for our vehicle is more than we can justify spending. This old work horse has travelled over three hundred thousand miles. In addition, this Explorer is old enough, so as to be a concern for metal fatigue. Even if we did spend the $3,000.00+ needed to repair it, I cannot in good conscious allow passengers in our vehicle any longer. We cannot risk putting this kind of repair money into the transmission, just to have catastrophic engine failure the following week. More importantly, the headliner of this vehicle is quickly rotting. Every bump causes fine dust from that deteriorating fabric to rain down upon passengers. What that inhaled dust may contain is a serious concern.<br/>
</p>
<p>At the minimum, we need you to help us raise. $5,000.00. That will allow us to at least put up a substantial down payment on a stable vehicle for our organization. Exhaustive attempts locally to have a vehicle donated have failed so we are turning to you to make this happen. That is, if we are without the means to deliver our technology to these future scientists, engineers, teachers and doctors. One of the kids from this generation will place the first human footprint on Mars.<br/></p>
<p>Of course, it is our hope that this fund raiser takes off and we far surpass our goal.  We could then pay for a delivery van in full and not incur debt. But should we not meet our goal, we will put that money aside until we can figure out another way to raise the additional money we need. We have accomplished some fantastic things since 2005. It's my hope that you believe in our project enough to help us through this.<br/></p>

<h1>Fecal Transplants. Amazing and disgusting!</h1>
<p>Simply put, a FMT (Fecal Microbiota Transplant) is the process of putting fecal matter from a healthy person into the bowel system of an ill person. This process recolonizes the bowel with healthy bacteria. It's gross. We know. However, this is the best way to flood the body with billions of healthy bacteria. We are talking about probiotics to the tenth power! Unlike popular probiotics, which have a difficult time surviving the digestive environment, FMT's have proven successful in the treatment of numerous digestive ailments. FMT's are essentially an immune system transplant.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/924360/files/20141012110138-shutterstock_127653155.jpg?1413136898"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Mybiotica seeks to champion the development of a home FMT in pill form.  A simple, sanitary, economical delivery method for direct to consumer sales. This FMT pill will allow individuals to access an unprescidented, thousand year old treatment that can revolutionize the world of self-health.  </p>

<p>Like the rainforest, the healthy human microbiome is a balanced ecosystem. The correct balance of microbes keeps potential pathogens in check and regulates our immune system. Microbes also perform essential functions such as digesting food, synthesizing vitamins, and regulating the immune system. Studies have also linked the microbiome to human mood and behavior, as well as many gut disorders, eczema, and chronic sinusitis.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/924375/files/20141012110819-shutterstock_199443881.jpg?1413137299"" src="""" style=""width: 505.513px; height: 338px;""/></p>
<p>The number of scientific studies increases daily as FMT's become better known. These studies have linked the microbiome to allergies, fatigue, belly fat, skin problems, as well as serious disorders like eczema, chronic sinuses, bowel disease, chronic constipation, diarrhea, Crohn's disease, colitis, and C. Difficile. Odds are you know someone who has been diagnosed with one of these health maladies and the constant suffering associated with them. Until FMT's, there has been no successful long lasting treatment for many digestive diseases. FMT's are also being looked at for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. People with digestive diseases can suffer from depression, anxiety, memory issues, and cognitive impairment. These issues often disappear with fecal transplants.</p>

<br/><p>So who discovered FMT's anyway? No one knows for sure. All we know is that it was some thousand years before pharmaceuticals started selling their expensive, low percent success, high side effect drugs. History suggests it came from ancient Chinese healers—it doesn't really matter. What we can agree on is that they were certainly a bold and intrepid bunch. </p>
<p>What does matter is that this homegrown procedure is becoming the darling of modern medicine because of its undisputed effectiveness. FMT's have been recently recognized by organizations like MIT, the Mayo Clinic, National Institute of Health, John Hopkins, and others. Before long, the best business minds will wrap it, brand it, and sell it as a new and improved, ""supervision required"", expensive treatment.<br/></p>
<p><span>Home
 Fecal Microbiota Transplants have been inexpensive and completely 
natural. Our concern is that they are becoming better known in the 
medical industry, but not on main street. Why can't FMT's stay in the 
home where they have been for centuries? We are talking about a medical 
revolution in self-health here. As Dr. Robert Orenstein of the Mayo 
Clinic recently stated, ""The microbiota of the gut is not inactive; it's
 diverse and plays many roles in health and well being that are just now
 being explored. This can only get bigger. It's like the beginning of 
the space program.""</span></p>

<p>Obviously the big, we mean really big, drawback to home FMT's has been the ""OK, that's really disgusting"" factor. Mybiotica wants to make the process more sanitary and simple. No more ""how to videos"", no more approaching stool donors, no plastic containers, no blenders, no strainers, no spoons, no spills, no smell, no mess....no ick. Just a simple pill sold direct to the consumer at a fraction of the cost of a hospital administered FMT—if you are lucky enough to find a hospital that even knows about the treatment.</p>

<div>One of our close loved ones was affected by an extreme bowel disorder for eight long years—it was Hell! She went to doctors and was told she had allergies to food, so she changed her diet, and added probiotics. When that didn't work, she was told it was a parasite. She was given harsh prescriptions and also took every vitamin under the sun. After years of trying everything, she finally found relief because of this amazing treatment. Because of the ick factor, people, even those the treatment brings relief to, are reluctant to suggest FMT's to others. We feel an urgency to bring this product to the world in a more approachable manner. We know that we can with your support! We can make FMT's available to millions who are suffering!</div>

</div></div>","Fecal Transplants. Amazing and disgusting!
Simply put, a FMT (Fecal Microbiota Transplant) is the process of putting fecal matter from a healthy person into the bowel system of an ill person. This process recolonizes the bowel with healthy bacteria. It's gross. We know. However, this is the best way to flood the body with billions of healthy bacteria. We are talking about probiotics to the tenth power! Unlike popular probiotics, which have a difficult time surviving the digestive environment, FMT's have proven successful in the treatment of numerous digestive ailments. FMT's are essentially an immune system transplant.



Mybiotica seeks to champion the development of a home FMT in pill form.  A simple, sanitary, economical delivery method for direct to consumer sales. This FMT pill will allow individuals to access an unprescidented, thousand year old treatment that can revolutionize the world of self-health.  


Like the rainforest, the healthy human microbiome is a balanced ecosystem. The correct balance of microbes keeps potential pathogens in check and regulates our immune system. Microbes also perform essential functions such as digesting food, synthesizing vitamins, and regulating the immune system. Studies have also linked the microbiome to human mood and behavior, as well as many gut disorders, eczema, and chronic sinusitis.

The number of scientific studies increases daily as FMT's become better known. These studies have linked the microbiome to allergies, fatigue, belly fat, skin problems, as well as serious disorders like eczema, chronic sinuses, bowel disease, chronic constipation, diarrhea, Crohn's disease, colitis, and C. Difficile. Odds are you know someone who has been diagnosed with one of these health maladies and the constant suffering associated with them. Until FMT's, there has been no successful long lasting treatment for many digestive diseases. FMT's are also being looked at for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Rheumatoid Arthritis. People with digestive diseases can suffer from depression, anxiety, memory issues, and cognitive impairment. These issues often disappear with fecal transplants.


So who discovered FMT's anyway? No one knows for sure. All we know is that it was some thousand years before pharmaceuticals started selling their expensive, low percent success, high side effect drugs. History suggests it came from ancient Chinese healers—it doesn't really matter. What we can agree on is that they were certainly a bold and intrepid bunch. 
What does matter is that this homegrown procedure is becoming the darling of modern medicine because of its undisputed effectiveness. FMT's have been recently recognized by organizations like MIT, the Mayo Clinic, National Institute of Health, John Hopkins, and others.

<p>I mused and discussed it for about as long as we've been here, and finally last Fall the horse I was looking for turned up almost on our doorstep.

The temperament, size, power, and ability to thrive on supermodel portions of forage had marked Haflingers out to my eye as the perfect draft animal for small farms. We have the horse. But as a group we need to get her:</p> <ul> <li>A single draft harness, which for a Haflinger sized horse runs well over <a href=""http://www.brubachersharness.ca/contents/en-us/d1757.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">$1,000.00 cdn.</a>, even if parts can be acquired second hand. </li>
<li>Scuffler (cultivator) and plow for vineyard work - used or the new <a href=""http://www.farmingwithhorses.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amish designed models</a>.</li>
<li> Fencing and small buildings for shelter, tack and forage.</li>
</ul>
<div>That's what you're funding here, should you team up with Lily and this novice teamster. For our family's part, aside from our abiding thanks and appreciation, we have a number of different options for support and reward - from paper to tin, from glass to plate. We hope there's something that catches your eye or imagination. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Domaine La Reine - our vineyard - continues along on its own small, determined budget. Lily and this opportunity arrived in an unanticipated manner. We've set the goal for this project to a low practical level. Apart from the key requirements, every extra bit helps, and keen deals or generous support will mean Lily gets a companion animal or two that a herd creature needs for health; better fencing and buildings; and other such details.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Why Does it Matter?</h3> <p>I've spent the last two decades growing wine grapes organically. I've made well received <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2EGevWM2VE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">wines</a>. I've <a href=""http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/a-fool-and-forty-acres/9780771040566-item.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">written</a> about the viticultural life. It was always the goal to introduce a draft animal into the process. Truthfully, until our farm has livestock, I feel we've not lived up to our part of being true farmers:</p> <ul> <li>Hooves &amp; human feet are much gentler on the land, cutting soil compaction. We still have our tractors, but a horse can help greatly lessen their inevitable punishment.</li> <li>The last generation that farmed Prince Edward with horses is still around and can still hand on those skills.</li> <li>Putting livestock back into the farm increases soil health through natural fertilizer.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>If It's so Easy, Why Isn't Everyone Doing it?</h3> <p>It's not particularly easy. It's also not rocket science. However, kitting out a draft animal and learning how to gain and keep its trust in a work environment requires the expert help of those who know how these things are best fitted and fashioned.</p>
<p>We have the knowledgeable neighbours who can do this.</p>
<p>We have the vines, and now the horse, in place.</p>
<p>How swiftly we can put this team together to pull for place and purpose is our most formidable obstacle.</p>
<p>That, and how quick or slow a study I might be aft of the handles.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Let's All Get Lily Back to Work</h3> <p>Not everyone is in a position to contribute to this project directly, Even if your finances have thinned out (as a lot of us have seen lately), if you find this an interesting and worthy little quest, you can give invaluable assistance by:</p>
<ul> <li>Pointing us out to people you know who might think the same way as you.</li>

The temperament, size, power, and ability to thrive on supermodel portions of forage had marked Haflingers out to my eye as the perfect draft animal for small farms. We have the horse. But as a group we need to get her:  A single draft harness, which for a Haflinger sized horse runs well over $1,000.00 cdn., even if parts can be acquired second hand. 
Scuffler (cultivator) and plow for vineyard work - used or the new Amish designed models.
 Fencing and small buildings for shelter, tack and forage.

That's what you're funding here, should you team up with Lily and this novice teamster. For our family's part, aside from our abiding thanks and appreciation, we have a number of different options for support and reward - from paper to tin, from glass to plate. We hope there's something that catches your eye or imagination. 

Domaine La Reine - our vineyard - continues along on its own small, determined budget. Lily and this opportunity arrived in an unanticipated manner. We've set the goal for this project to a low practical level. Apart from the key requirements, every extra bit helps, and keen deals or generous support will mean Lily gets a companion animal or two that a herd creature needs for health; better fencing and buildings; and other such details.
   Why Does it Matter? I've spent the last two decades growing wine grapes organically. I've made well received wines. I've written about the viticultural life. It was always the goal to introduce a draft animal into the process. Truthfully, until our farm has livestock, I feel we've not lived up to our part of being true farmers:  Hooves & human feet are much gentler on the land, cutting soil compaction. We still have our tractors, but a horse can help greatly lessen their inevitable punishment. The last generation that farmed Prince Edward with horses is still around and can still hand on those skills. Putting livestock back into the farm increases soil health through natural fertilizer.    
If It's so Easy, Why Isn't Everyone Doing it? It's not particularly easy. It's also not rocket science. However, kitting out a draft animal and learning how to gain and keep its trust in a work environment requires the expert help of those who know how these things are best fitted and fashioned.
We have the knowledgeable neighbours who can do this.
We have the vines, and now the horse, in place.
How swiftly we can put this team together to pull for place and purpose is our most formidable obstacle.
That, and how quick or slow a study I might be aft of the handles.   Let's All Get Lily Back to Work Not everyone is in a position to contribute to this project directly, Even if your finances have thinned out (as a lot of us have seen lately), if you find this an interesting and worthy little quest, you can give invaluable assistance by:

<p></p>
<p>Our proposal consists in offering
an olfactory compensation for an absence. In other words, we will allow people
to smell the odor of a loved one (humans, or animals for example: dogs, cats or
horses) when the person or animal is either temporarily or definitively gone (for
example, deceased). In this case, we can produce a faithful reconstitution
of a human or animal scent. We shall present it like a fragrance, in a
customized box. We are about to create the first world’s community of olfactory
comfort through a new tool, thanks to your support. </p>
<p><b>Several of you have to expressed
your needs concerning a loved one’s smell (whether boyfriend, girlfriend,
husband, wife, children or even loved pets such as cats, dogs and horses). You
say:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>“</b><b>My boyfriend’s scent, or more specifically his
physical odor - what a beautiful smell… He intoxicates me with his smell, when I
smell him, I’m alive, because I feel him here, close to me”…</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What a pity we can’t put all that
in a perfume bottle</b><b>!</b></p>
<p><b>But in fact, now it is possible - thanks to our technology, and thanks to your

some point in our lives, we must
all face a trying family event; the death of a close realtion. In
our case , it was my grandfather death on Father’s
day, six years ago. Over the past six years, especially during the last five, my
mother has been working on this project. In times of mourning, we
all feel a need for comfort, which is expressed differently according to each individual. My mother and I needed
to keep my grandfather’s smell alive. Others cling
to photos, specific objects or voice messages. </p>
<p><br/>He was diabetic and since then, I have learned that certain
 illnesses, including diabetes, leave a specific odor. He was also 
struggling with
cancer, and was bedridden, accompanied by
his ​​little dog (who had a pungent
smell!). My grandfather also wore a strong perfume - the
FARHEINEIT fragrance. A mixture of all these smells was what my
mother wanted to to keep with her
forever. </p>
<p>My mother
didn’t dare talk about
it at first, she thought she was crazy… but finally she
admitted it to my grandmother… who felt the same! She’d never dared 
mention it
to to my mother in fear of being thought crazy herself. But she had
also kept unwashed pillowcases, just to
keep the smell of this love alive!
In studying the psychology of grief, I realized that we all experience 
similar emotions. Such feelings are natural, normal, and utterly 
legitimate. </p>So, here were 2 ""crazy"" women,
I thought perhaps there were others… My mother became
interestedindiscoveringmany otheraccounts.<span>There was a definite need here, but no response.  Work was
required to meet this need, find a solution
and launch a company. For my
mother, this was also a way of grieving, a way of prolonging my
grandfather’s story through a special enterprise.</span>

When my mother explained her need to
recreate that specific scent, and then, her amazing project to reconstite the
smell of loved ones, I completely supported her! Since then,I have contributed to
her research. At first I<span>  helped in my own
way, given I was still a student. But I’ve been working full time on this project

<p>I have worked in Asia through different internships, and studied for a
semester at Thammasat University in Bangkok. My mother completed her last year at
ESSCA at the Facultad Autonoma in Madrid. In 1997, she founded her own insurance

</p>
<p>We have always been highly sensitive to all kinds of smells. Today, we’re
working together to launch our start up. </p>
<p>We assure you that our research is even more advanced than PATRICK
SUSKIND’s for his book, Perfume, whose protagonist had to kill people to possess
their smell!</p>
<p><br/>

manufacture olfactory links, and we operate in the emotional zone. To this end,

usual visual and auditory supports: we are innovating this domain with
olfactory supplements. This is a completely new response to a vast, global
demand. </span></span></p>
<p><br/>
At this step, we need your help to create the world’s first Olfactory Comfort community.
To achieve this, we need funds to purchase manufacturing material, and to
create a full time job for a chemist. Moreover, we need some stock to present

<p><span>Ø<span>

<p>If we don't collect the entire amount targeted, funds raised will allow

<p>At Marilyn and Michelle, we are girlfriends who found one another through our shared journey of having double mastectomies.  Our goal is simply to help women who are recovering from breast issues related to cancer, enhancements, reductions or simply large breasted or pregnant gals who are side or stomach sleepers. After all, if you’re recovering from surgery, what you need most is a good night’s sleep. Sweet, solid, sleep.  </p>Sleep is such a big part of recovery and it was something we both struggled to do much of after our mastectomies. Marilyn had breast cancer and Michelle had a long family history of the disease and made a preventative choice. So we asked ourselves – how can we fix this? And with that our TaTa Topper idea was crafted with the help of our families, friends and countless others that we are thankful to now call friends.<p></p> </div><div>After our surgeries we both felt as though the process of recovery should be easier for women.  Beyond dealing with the emotional and physical pain, sleep was much too difficult.  Lack of sleep created more problems for us.  Depression set in and the healing process became more difficult.  We both believe that we can help other women avoid some of the stress caused by lack of sleep.  Like so many women in our community, we just wanted to help in some way.  Creating the TaTa Topper and other comfort products is our way of paying it forward.  <br/>
</div><div>With your donations, we will be able to get our business up and running.  That means we can start helping more women get more sleep and hopefully heal much faster with less discomfort.  We all know what it’s like not to sleep well.  Giving a donation is giving the gift of sleep and healing.  </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $20,000.00 to cover our start up expenses and initial production. </p>
<p>We began working on TaTa Toppers this past spring, and so far have poured our hearts and bank accounts into funding all activities and expenses for this passion project of ours. However, we have come to realize that in order to produce an economically sensible amount of TaTaToppers that can reach at least 200 women, we need your support! </p>
<p>We'd like to bring our company to the public, but we can't do it alone! Your funding will help us to make this idea become a reality.</p>
<p>We have been reminded by many people that in order for us to do good in this world and improve the lives of women that share our experiences, we must be a financially viable company. </p>
<p>We are striving to make the TaTa Topper available to women by the start of 2015. </p>
<p>As a thank you for your contributions, below is a list of what you will get in return: </p>
<p>$ 25 - TaTa Topper sticker and personal note </p>
<p>$ 50 - ""Support the TaTa Topper so it can Support you"" T-Shirt </p>
<p>$100 - 10 of our favorite recipes to make for a recovering friend (Soups, Casseroles, Gift Baskets, and great food ideas for kids) </p>
<p>$ 200 - Comfort pack for a friend made by <a href=""http://www.getwellpack.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wellpack</a></p>
<p>$ 500 -TaTa Topper for you or a donation of one to <a href=""http://www.massey.vcu.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VCU's Massey Cancer Center</a></p>
<p>$ 1,000 - Dinner with the founders</p>
<h3>The Impact<span><br/></span>
</h3>
</div><div> <p></p>This project is important to us because we have been there.  We have suffered through the long sleepless nights and if we can help women feel a tiny bit more normal during a rough time, we want to make that difference for them.  We feel that our product is simple yet effective.  It brings comfort when comfort is hard to find.  We have been lucky enough to use our product and share it with close friends who are also healing from mastectomies.  Their testimonials have been positive and they are telling their doctors how well they are sleeping thanks to the TaTaTopper.</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk in starting this business is if we are not able to afford our first round of production then we will lose the money that we have invested so far.  We have been able to brand our company and produce our first prototypes, however, without being able to sell them we risk losing not only that money but most importantly, the brand.  </p>
<p>We need to make both women and doctors aware of our product and to educate them about the benefits TaTa Toppers offer. We plan to address these challenges through our RIchmond business colleagues and network of friends, as well as publicly on our blog and website.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>Donations are just one way we can use your support! You can also help us by spreading the word about TaTaToppers!  The more people that know about this product, the more women we will be able to reach. <p></p><blockquote style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; line-height: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"" type=""cite""></blockquote><div><div dir=""ltr""><p><i><br/></i></p></div></div></div>","Short Summary

With your donations, we will be able to get our business up and running.  That means we can start helping more women get more sleep and hopefully heal much faster with less discomfort.  We all know what it’s like not to sleep well.  Giving a donation is giving the gift of sleep and healing.    What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $20,000.00 to cover our start up expenses and initial production. 
We began working on TaTa Toppers this past spring, and so far have poured our hearts and bank accounts into funding all activities and expenses for this passion project of ours. However, we have come to realize that in order to produce an economically sensible amount of TaTaToppers that can reach at least 200 women, we need your support! 
We'd like to bring our company to the public, but we can't do it alone! Your funding will help us to make this idea become a reality.
We have been reminded by many people that in order for us to do good in this world and improve the lives of women that share our experiences, we must be a financially viable company. 
We are striving to make the TaTa Topper available to women by the start of 2015. 
As a thank you for your contributions, below is a list of what you will get in return: 
$ 25 - TaTa Topper sticker and personal note 
$ 50 - ""Support the TaTa Topper so it can Support you"" T-Shirt 
$100 - 10 of our favorite recipes to make for a recovering friend (Soups, Casseroles, Gift Baskets, and great food ideas for kids) 
$ 200 - Comfort pack for a friend made by Wellpack
$ 500 -TaTa Topper for you or a donation of one to VCU's Massey Cancer Center
$ 1,000 - Dinner with the founders
The Impact

 This project is important to us because we have been there.  We have suffered through the long sleepless nights and if we can help women feel a tiny bit more normal during a rough time, we want to make that difference for them.  We feel that our product is simple yet effective.  It brings comfort when comfort is hard to find.  We have been lucky enough to use our product and share it with close friends who are also healing from mastectomies.  Their testimonials have been positive and they are telling their doctors how well they are sleeping thanks to the TaTaTopper.
Risks & Challenges
The risk in starting this business is if we are not able to afford our first round of production then we will lose the money that we have invested so far.  We have been able to brand our company and produce our first prototypes, however, without being able to sell them we risk losing not only that money but most importantly, the brand.  
We need to make both women and doctors aware of our product and to educate them about the benefits TaTa Toppers offer. We plan to address these challenges through our RIchmond business colleagues and network of friends, as well as publicly on our blog and website.

Other Ways You Can Help 
Donations are just one way we can use your support! You can also help us by spreading the word about TaTaToppers!  The more people that know about this product, the more women we will be able to reach.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our friend Kurt Becker took a big fall from a ladder and is now in the ICU at Blake Medical Center in Bradenton, FL. He broke 2 vertebrae and had to have an emergency surgery to install titanium plates to secure them. He currently is paralyzed from the waist down and is going to have a LONG road to recovery. Please donate anything you can to help Kurt through this tough time and help him with his medical bills.
We will post updates on his condition as they become available.
Currently, there are also plans being put together for some fundraising events. Please check back, as we will post info on them here as well.
Let's show Kurt how much he is loved and please keep him in you thoughts and prayers. Thank you!

WE BACK WITH A NEW CAMPAIGN ?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">After using the decompresing chamber for 2 years,Rise`s health has improved to the almost unrecgnizable  and is ready to be able to live a much more normal life...</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;""> She  still experinces few symptoms in certain activities, social  and work
related  situations - if ignored they get very serious.  To find a
balance where all symptoms are covered anyone agree; a stronger chamber that
can provide a higher pressure so she can adjust after need  will solve the
last  problems.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The
reasons we unconditionally provide full support for a new fundraising campaign
is that Rise has done a tremendous effort to try to help others the last two years.<br/><span>She has
not spared herself but has done an extreme effort.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; background-color: initial;"">She realized she COULD  help  and started to see how to organize it. It ended up in plans for a center !! </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; background-color: initial;"">We want to help her -also cause noone ever expected her to survice -  and be able to do anything like this !!</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; background-color: initial;"">BUT - to be able to go awy where from here,  she needs a chamber that can provide a stroger pressure ! </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">MORE
ABOUT THE CENTER;</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">Rise suffers from a very rare kind of spinal damage causing  extreme symptoms. And at least 12  other disorders - one is a rare genetic, multisystemic connective tissue disease (Ehlers Danloss Syndrome) <br/>To survive and retain as much ""quality of life ""as possible, she developed various unique pain handling techniques.<br/>You can see more abut what kind of pain she had to deal with here;<a href=""http://www.artderise.com/blog/2012/07/11/Pain-scale.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.artderise.com/blog/2012/07/11/Pain-scale.aspx<br/></a>Her pain and stress management medical specialists  have encouraged her to  publish   ! </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-style: normal;"">She will be working wih doctors and physiotherapists at the center !<br/><br/></span></p>

</p>
<p>THE PROGRAM.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>  Different from, for
example, traditional N.L.P. - this is an authentic, complex program, developed under long-term, extreme pressure both
physically and mentally. As a way of survival.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Program consists of;</p>
<p>- The ""talking with yourself""  (N.L.P.)technique is introduced to you with
instructions for individual use as long as you need.</p>
<p>Combind with; </p>
<p>-  Special kind of
relaxation, </p>
<p> - Breathing
techniques, </p>
<p> - Posture control and
</p>
<p> - Attitude training
and </p>
<p> - Massage </p>
<p> - All as a complext
program. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">In addition  combined with creativity;</span></p>
<p>- Intuitive paint enhances your inner dialogues - colors,
shapes, words, symbols. </p>
<p>When, for example, translate words into forms of movement it
will activate more brain centers and to enhance understanding and effectiveness !</p>
<p>- <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">Of course you can not change the reality and the things that have happened,  but you can help yourself by changing your experience and easen the symptoms  by ""talking to yourself"" in a new way about the incident,combind it with the special relaxsation  in this program,  and using intuitive painting, change attitude and future behavior.- By using all parts of the program you will  not only change the way you think but also the way you feel. </span></p>

HAPPENS IF WE GO OVER THE GOAL ?<br/></span></span><span><span>
Then there will be money for accessories for the chamber.<br/></span></span><span><span>
All what is used inside must be 100 percent cotton; pillows, blankets,
clothes.  LEDlamps would be great ! Or a
cooler - it can be very hot inside a chamber !<br/></span></span><span><span>
Always needed are also special disinfetions and cleaner for this kind of
eqipment.<br/></span></span><span><span>
A rail would also be good as it will make it easier for Rise to get in and out
of the chamber as disabled. Like all special eipment it is very expensive.</span></span></span></p>

<p>IMPORTANT THOUGHTS ABOUT PERKS BASIC AND CONTRIBUTING GENERALLY !     </p>
<p>During the last campaign some people wrote and excused they
were not able to help with more than one dollar and they felt bad as they felt
that would be way to little but they wanted to send their best wishes ! We were
deeply moved over this and of course answered right back than NO donation is
too small to count! After the fundraising we could see actually a huge amount
was these one dollar-donations! This only proves that if we are many that help
we can do a lot!!</p>
<p>And please be assured that any one want to help is very,
very appreciated by all of us here! Being in a difficult situation and
experiencing financial problems on top makes it hard to feel you can make a
difference. Well you most certainly can.</p>

This is
a new campaign as Rise is now ready for stage 2 in her treatment - and in her
life as she is ready to help others;

- Brand
new unique pain and stresss handling techniques - highly evaluated by
specialists.open workshop.
-
Production of new, much more comfortable  oxygen eqipment ! 
We
think it is pretty cool; 
 Figthing for her life, raising herself -  right away starts planning
how to help others - planning entrepreneurship capital investors valued highly
          - AT THE AGE OF 50!



Since this is a situation
with a of lot background knowledge  in many areas,  it is impossible to gather all this in a clear
way,  therefore you have the opportunity
to read more by clicking on the links (you will also find it in danish on those websites) and if you have questions or comments
please feel free to write and you will hear from us very quickly - thanks for
understanding!
Our first campaign;
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/chamber-for-rise/x/579039
Rises situation  - HBO home treatment, documentation etc,     www.artderise.com both in danish and english.(Treatment in progress)
The last two years - the background for  this campaign;
http://www.artderise-uniq.com/prework-for-the-center


WHY ARE
WE BACK WITH A NEW CAMPAIGN ?
After using the decompresing chamber for 2 years,Rise`s health has improved to the almost unrecgnizable  and is ready to be able to live a much more normal life...
 She  still experinces few symptoms in certain activities, social  and work
related  situations - if ignored they get very serious.  To find a
balance where all symptoms are covered anyone agree; a stronger chamber that
can provide a higher pressure so she can adjust after need  will solve the
last  problems.
The
reasons we unconditionally provide full support for a new fundraising campaign
is that Rise has done a tremendous effort to try to help others the last two years.She has
not spared herself but has done an extreme effort.
She realized she COULD  help  and started to see how to organize it. It ended up in plans for a center !! 
We want to help her -also cause noone ever expected her to survice -  and be able to do anything like this !!
BUT - to be able to go awy where from here,  she needs a chamber that can provide a stroger pressure ! 
  
MORE
ABOUT THE CENTER;
Rise suffers from a very rare kind of spinal damage causing  extreme symptoms. And at least 12  other disorders - one is a rare genetic, multisystemic connective tissue disease (Ehlers Danloss Syndrome) To survive and retain as much ""quality of life ""as possible, she developed various unique pain handling techniques.You can see more abut what kind of pain she had to deal with here;http://www.artderise.com/blog/2012/07/11/Pain-scale.aspxHer pain and stress management medical specialists  have encouraged her to  publish   ! 
She will be working wih doctors and physiotherapists at the center !


THE PROGRAM..


  Different from, for
example, traditional N.L.P. - this is an authentic, complex program, developed under long-term, extreme pressure both
physically and mentally. As a way of survival.

Program consists of;
- The ""talking with yourself""  (N.L.P.)technique is introduced to you with
instructions for individual use as long as you need.
Combind with; 
-  Special kind of
relaxation, 
 - Breathing
techniques, 
 - Posture control and

 - Attitude training
and 
 - Massage 
 - All as a complext
program. 
In addition  combined with creativity;
- Intuitive paint enhances your inner dialogues - colors,
shapes, words, symbols. 
When, for example, translate words into forms of movement it
will activate more brain centers and to enhance understanding and effectiveness !
- Of course you can not change the reality and the things that have happened,  but you can help yourself by changing your experience and easen the symptoms  by ""talking to yourself"" in a new way about the incident,combind it with the special relaxsation  in this program,  and using intuitive painting, change attitude and future behavior.- By using all parts of the program you will  not only change the way you think but also the way you feel. 
You can read more here;
http://www.artderise-uniq.com/stress-pain-handling-program-2
and about the different parts of the program here;
http://www.artderise-uniq.com/the-different-parts
And in danish;

WHO CAN USE IT ?
We humans are incredibly diverse.
For some it will be too strange !!
For others something they can learn after a little while,
for others pure fun from day one!
You will need to be able to use your imagination, your
fantasy.
This is a  concept of great social and human value. With very few simple
measures it can reach many people and become a center with activities to
improve quality of life. 






There are more plans for other activities and services - again very uniqu services ! There is still too much needed prework to start talking about these now, but  other exciting things wil come ! 


WEBSHOP

There will also be a webshop with written, easy to follow e-learning
magazines to buy and download. 
http://www.artderise-uniq.com/members-area

 WHEN?
It all depends on this highly needed  chamber  – since this is a
situation that depends on Rises situation –  she needs  help, this
campaign is listed under health and not entrepreneurship. 
If she can have a stronger chamber soon a realistic
plan for starting the center and the first activities in this year - 2014!
There are of course still many details but starting several of the planned
activities can easily be in this year!

WHAT DO YOU GET IF YOU ARE NOT CLOSE TO THE CENTER ? 
This is a program you can  have acess to if you have an online connection ! (offcourse not the massage etc but most other parts will be available)
 - You can have the full written program.  (Files, videos etc)
- Online, confidente  sessions with Rise. 

 So please JOIN US so we can make something spectacular !!



WHAT
HAPPENS IF WE DONT REACH THE GOAL ? 

We will again be extremely gratefull for ALL help ! 
- WHAT
HAPPENS IF WE GO OVER THE GOAL ?
Then there will be money for accessories for the chamber.
All what is used inside must be 100 percent cotton; pillows, blankets,
clothes.  LEDlamps would be great ! Or a
cooler - it can be very hot inside a chamber !
Always needed are also special disinfetions and cleaner for this kind of
eqipment.
A rail would also be good as it will make it easier for Rise to get in and out
of the chamber as disabled. Like all special eipment it is very expensive.

Rise in the needed chamber - when she inspected it

WHAT DO WE NEED?

1 flexilite chamber;      13000 usd

the incoming funds! Just please add to shipping where this is mentioned. All
contributors will be on a list and you will all be kept updated during the

IMPORTANT THOUGHTS ABOUT PERKS BASIC AND CONTRIBUTING GENERALLY !     
During the last campaign some people wrote and excused they
were not able to help with more than one dollar and they felt bad as they felt
that would be way to little but they wanted to send their best wishes ! We were
deeply moved over this and of course answered right back than NO donation is
too small to count! After the fundraising we could see actually a huge amount
was these one dollar-donations! This only proves that if we are many that help
we can do a lot!!
And please be assured that any one want to help is very,
very appreciated by all of us here! Being in a difficult situation and
experiencing financial problems on top makes it hard to feel you can make a
difference. Well you most certainly can.

<h3><i>The Problem</i></h3>
<p>Partisan politics and the rising cost of healthcare are destroying the ability for this generation to have immediate access to quality healthcare. It's time to break the healthcare paradigm. With the changes that are upon us, access to healthcare is at its most critical moment in history.</p>
<p>Our concept is to bring immediate and affordable healthcare to everyone. With your contribution, you will enable us to meet with the top telemedicine minds in North America at the American Telemedicine Association Conference. You will help us get one step closer to bringing you access to board certified doctors via telephone, secure email or videoconferencing from your home, school, vacation or anywhere.</p>
<p>With this campaign, not only will you help increase access to healthcare, you can score some great perks, including the opportunity to help us name our service! See the side bar for details.<br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
I realize that not everyone can contribute and I thank you for reading this far. If you feel that affordable and immediate healthcare is important, please share this campaign with others.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","The Problem
Partisan politics and the rising cost of healthcare are destroying the ability for this generation to have immediate access to quality healthcare. It's time to break the healthcare paradigm. With the changes that are upon us, access to healthcare is at its most critical moment in history.
Our concept is to bring immediate and affordable healthcare to everyone. With your contribution, you will enable us to meet with the top telemedicine minds in North America at the American Telemedicine Association Conference. You will help us get one step closer to bringing you access to board certified doctors via telephone, secure email or videoconferencing from your home, school, vacation or anywhere.
With this campaign, not only will you help increase access to healthcare, you can score some great perks, including the opportunity to help us name our service! See the side bar for details.
We are Jim Devitt and Todd Martin. We have worked in healthcare for the past 20 years and quite frankly, we're sick of what we've seen. The system is broken. Costs are rising and care is getting harder to find. Here's what the American Medical Association and the media are saying about it:


The shortage of primary care physicians will make it more difficult to see the doctor, wait times will increase beyond comprehension: http://www.amednews.com/article/20130701/business/130709995/9/.
High Deductible Insurance Plans will increase the burden on the middle class, taking more dollars out of your pockets before your plan pays a dime: http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/05/business/la-fi-healthcare-watch-20130505.



Enough—individuals deserve better. Patients shouldn't have to sit in waiting rooms in the ER or doctor's office for hours to seek treatment for simple issues. This generation knows the value of time and trusts mobile technology. It's time to change the broken healthcare system and start treating patients in the privacy and comfort of their home.

It's time for real change.

Life is to be lived on the soccer fields not sitting in the bleachers watching life go by as life is short.<br/></p><p>Seven years ago l fell bad on ice at my apartment l was renting at the time.  I was very sore but at the time had depression and was nervous to go to the hospital from past stima's over my depression issues.  My doctor would never tell me for sure what l did to my back only saying you have degenerative disc diease starting.  Then three years ago a psyio therepasit said to me do you know that did huge spinal damage in you L5 disc and that you have a really bad back.  These past seven years my back has really caused me to miss out on lots of quality living having to live life on the bleachers.  Daily l live with huge amounts of pain taking pain medication to combat this as my lower back pain and pain down my  right leg goes to my foot.  There is countless nights l lay awake as the pain for my back is so bad like a knife stabbing and this horrible pain goes down my legs.  I have cried countless times over my back pain when the pills don't take this pain away and it hurts so bad just to breathe.  Each day more and more the pain seems to be getting worse and you really wonder what the sense of living as some times depression wants to set in again.

Life is to be lived on the soccer fields not sitting in the bleachers watching life go by as life is short.Seven years ago l fell bad on ice at my apartment l was renting at the time.  I was very sore but at the time had depression and was nervous to go to the hospital from past stima's over my depression issues.  My doctor would never tell me for sure what l did to my back only saying you have degenerative disc diease starting.  Then three years ago a psyio therepasit said to me do you know that did huge spinal damage in you L5 disc and that you have a really bad back.  These past seven years my back has really caused me to miss out on lots of quality living having to live life on the bleachers.  Daily l live with huge amounts of pain taking pain medication to combat this as my lower back pain and pain down my  right leg goes to my foot.  There is countless nights l lay awake as the pain for my back is so bad like a knife stabbing and this horrible pain goes down my legs.  I have cried countless times over my back pain when the pills don't take this pain away and it hurts so bad just to breathe.  Each day more and more the pain seems to be getting worse and you really wonder what the sense of living as some times depression wants to set in again. In the morning the pain is really bad and medication has to be taken two hours in advance so l can wake up at a normal time and be able to function with some pain control over the pain.  More and more l am getting more physically disabled and if l do activities I pay the price later for doing the activity with lots of pain in return.  Lots of times the only way l can try to handle the pain is to move around all time standing siting or laying in my bed staring at four walls.

ABOUT ME:


I was born on October 21st in 2002.  
I am in third grade.  I'm a very good student.
I live with my mom Cristina, my dad Francisco and my brothers Pedro and Juan.
I love reading.  I would love to be part of my school's soccer team and belong to the cheerleader team.
CAMPAÑA:
La historia:
Nuestra familia vive en Quito capital del Ecuador
en Sudamérica.
Hace algo más de dos años notamos que Camila tenía
dificultades para mantener el equilibrio, 
además de problemas para caminar. 
Luego de un tiempo fue diagnosticada con lipomeningocele, que es una
malformación del tubo neural. 
Además se complica porque su médula espinal está anclada a nivel de las
últimas vértebras lumbares.
Su problema presenta una acumulación de tejido
graso que sujeta la médula espinal y por lo tanto en su proceso normal de
crecimiento, se comprimen nervios que han ocasionado que sus pies a la altura
de los tobillos se deformen.  
Este problema degenerativo a descalcificado sus talones; finalmente sus
pies se han flexionado hacia el interior lo que hace que cuando camina se
tropiece.   En los últimos
meses el dolor es muy fuerte,  ella
luego de regresar de la escuela debe permanecer acostada porque está
completamente cansada y adolorida.
Camila es una niña muy vital, siempre le gustaron
mucho las actividades lúdicas y deportivas.  A pesar de su dificultad trata de cumplir con todas las
actividades de una niña de su edad. 
Siempre se esfuerza y nunca se da por vencida.
La solución para este problema es una operación que
corregirá la malformación del tubo neural con prótesis y  se desanclará la médula espinal.  Posteriormente deberá recibir
tratamiento especializado de fisioterapia que incluirá una segunda intervención
quirúrgica para corregir sus pies.
Luego de una larga espera no encontramos la manera
de operarla en el Hospital Baca Ortiz, centro de asistencia pública de nuestro
país (www.hospitalbacaortiz.gov.ec).  Entonces decidimos ir a un Hospital
privado (www.hospitalmetropolitano.org).  En este lugar gracias a la Fundación
Metrofraternidad (www.metrofraternidad.org)  por fin encontramos la manera de
financiar de manera inmediata la cirugía de Camila.    Nuestro seguro privado nos contestó que apenas
cubriría US$ 500 dólares de total del costo de la cirugía.   Fue por la intervención de
Metrofraternidad que logramos una mayor cobertura, sin embargo aún debemos
sumar una cantidad que para nuestra condición económica es elevada.  El total de la cirugía está fijado en
US$ 11800,00 dólares, de los cuales la mayor parte asume Metrofraternidad.  Con nuestros ahorros aún no falta
completar algo más de US$ 3000 dólares.
Por eso hemos decidido confiar en la generosidad de
amigos y personas que se interesen en ayudar en esta Campaña, para recolectar
el dinero faltante.



CAMPAIGN
The Story:
Our family lives in Quito, the capital of Ecuador in South America.
Over two years ago, we noticed that Camila had difficulties keeping her balance, and in addition she had problems walking.  After a while, she was diagnosed with lypomeningocele, a neural tube defect.  Her condition is further complicated by the fact that her spine is anchored at her lumbar vertebrae's level.
Her condition entails an accumulation of the fatty tissue that supports the spine.  During the normal growth process, her nerves get compressed, causing her feet to deform from her ankles downwards.  This degenerative condition has decalcified her heels bending her feet inwards, causing her to trip when she walks.  In the past few months, the pain has been particularly strong.  After school, Camila needs to stay in bed because she is completely exhausted and in pain.
Camila is a very vital girl, she always liked to participated in play and sports.  In spite of her difficulties, she tries to keep up with the activities of other kids her age.  She always makes her best effort and never gives up.
The solution to this problem is a surgery that will correct the neural tube defect with a prothesis and the spine chord will be detached.  Afterwards, she should receive specialized physiotherapy that will include a second surgery to correct her feet.  
After a long wait, we were not able to find a way to do the surgery at Hospital Baca Ortiz, the children's public hospital in Ecuador (www.hospitalbacaortiz.gov.ec).  Therefore, we decided to go to a private hospital 
(www.hospitalmetropolitano.org).  At this hospital, thanks to Foundation Metrofraternidad  (www.metrofraternidad.org), we were finally able to find an immediate way to finance Camila's surgery.  Our private insurance company only accepted to cover 500 US Dollars of the total cost of the surgery.   Metrofraternidad intervened to cover the major part of the surgery, but the remaining costs are still beyond reach for someone in our economic situation. The surgery costs in total US$ 11800,00, the majority covered by aid from Metrofraternidad. After having used all our savings to cover our share, we still need to add around US$ 3000 more to make the surgery a reality.It is for this reason that we have decided to rely on the generosity of our friends and strangers to help our daughter and collect the funds needed to cover the remaining costs.


EL IMPACTO
La contribución que logremos con esta Campaña
tendrá un significativo impacto en mejorar la calidad de vida de Camila.  Aún luego de la operación debemos
continuar con su rehabilitación hasta lograr que en el transcurso del tiempo
pueda volver a jugar, correr y ser una niña con actividades normales.

THE IMPACT

Your contribution will have a direct impact on improving Camila's quality of life.  After the surgery, we must continue with her rehabilitation so, with time, she is able to play, run and participate in the normal activities for a kid of her age.

LO QUE CAMILA NECESITA
Lo que logremos recaudar en esta Campaña se
destinará íntegramente a completar la diferencia que debemos pagar por la
cirugía de Camila.  En el caso de
que se recaude un valor superior, lo destinaremos para cubrir con el
tratamiento de fisioterapia y si es necesario una nueva cirugía reconstructiva
de los pies de Camila.
Todas las personas que de una u otra forma apoyen
la Campaña, recibirán información permanente de la recuperación de Camila.

WHAT CAMILA NEEDS

All the money obtained in this campaign will be will be used in full to pay for balance for the total cost of the surgery.  In the event that we raise more than $3,000, any exceeding amount will be used to finance the  physiotherapy treatment and, if needed, the second surgery to reconstruct Camila's feet.
Everyone who contributes will get permanent updates on Camila's recovery.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Meierholtz. 5 years ago, my wife Melissa was diagnosed with acute kidney failure less than a year after giving birth to our beautiful son. Life changed. She began dialysis treatment at a local clinic but was determined to not let it interfere with her life. Not able to work, she decided it was time to go back to college to pursue a degree in Healthcare Management. In October of 2010, we made the decision to do dialysis in the comfort of our home in order to keep her as healthy as possible. We have rearranged our schedules and developed a new sense of normal. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, we traveled to MUSC for a kidney transplant. She underwent the operation on a Wednesday morning but the kidney failed and had to be removed the next day. Although dissapointing, we continue to be optimistic.</p>
<p>We are leaning on the promise of the Lord that he will lead us through this and bring us out the other side stronger. My wife is taking college courses while actively volunteering at our sons elementary school. She devotes most of her time to being an awesome mother and a loving wife. The expenses have only just begun as we await a successful transplant.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are only asking for 100 pennies from each person that looks at this. The cost of healthcare continues to rise. We are looking to raise $10,000 to go toward current medical bills and the transplant procedure we are sure is coming soon. The money will also be used for other expenses incurred such as medicines, insurance and traveling to MUSC for clinic visits.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone has a story. This one is ours that we hope to continue for many years. They say one person can change the world. Maybe Melissa will when she enters the heatlthcare management world to change it for future generations.</p>

<p>It has been a year from his last surgery and lost his short term memory from the second round of surgeries . Mike has made so much progress but the surgeon said it will be years before he gets his memory back and maybe not all of it but he is doing great! He is still going to the courage center in golden valley everyday. we met with the endocrinologist this week and he said his salt levels are under control with his medication he is on but his glucose levels were way to high. He has a big blood test that goes back 3 months and if it says all the three months are high he has diabetes along with already having diabetes insipidus.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Things are going pretty good he has his diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus pretty well under control. Mike just got his drivers license back but he has to have someone in the car with him and short distances. He was diagnosed just this past month with sleep apnea so now he has a machine that helps him breathe at night. He finished one of his memory loss programs called CRP at the courage center but he is still in the Raise program at the courage center MWF. He is starting vocational training and testing. With in the next month we have a few more doctors appointments plus a brain MRI so updates will be posted then. If you have any questions feel free to ask. We also wanted to thank you again  for all your love and support!</p>

We had last care meeting today at mikes memory lost facility today after tomorrow he will be coming home for good. He will go to a adult day care program Monday through Friday 830-4. The adult day care program is called Rise its in the golden valley courage center but not apart of the courage center. He will be taking metro mobility to the Rise program. The doctors wants us to do a test run by doing every other day on the sodium spray to see how much the gland in his brain is working. He will be following up at least once of week with our family doctor on excelsior to keep on his sodium levels.

<p><span>My name is Armando Alcaraz and I have been married to my AMAZING wife Maria for nearly 21 years.</span></p>
<p><span>We met at work.  She was one of our radio dispatchers and I was an officer.  She saved my life one night by getting me backup assistance.   That day I vowed that someday I would marry her. Three months later I asked her to marry me. This October we will celebrate 21 years! We have two wonderful children, Carlo and Amanda, and the four of us have been truly Blessed.</span></p>
<p><span>Two years ago, April 2010 Maria awoke with what appeared to be a skin rash.  At first we thought it was the new puppy we had rescued or the new laundry detergent that we had started to use.  It would not turn out to be.  Within 11 weeks, Maria was being hospitalized because her epiglottis could no longer function and she was near death due to an Auto Immune Disease ravaging her body known as Dermato Myositis. She was put on life support by means of a feeding tube and was given a new medication known as Intervenes Immune Globulin Infusion (IVIG) which would save her life. Along with Chemotherapy, High dose Steroids and other lifesaving medications she survived.  </span></p>
<p><span>At her worst, she lost the ability to walk, talk, eat and drink.  She had to have a hospital bed at home so that she would not drown in her own stomach contents while sleeping, a wheel chair for mobility and visiting nurses to care for her.  She lost her short term memory, cognitive thought process and partial vision due to steroid induced Glaucoma. The illness nearly took her life.  She went from rock climbing, walking and being fully independent to having to be cared for 24/7 for over seven months.</span></p>
<p><span>Specialists in Rheumatology, Neurology, Gastro Intestinal, Neuro- Ophthalmology, and Allergist have seen her.  Due to the rareness of her illness, to date, she has been seen by nearly 175 doctors and specialists, in order for them to have a firsthand look at her signs and symptoms.  Some may never see another case like hers in their careers.</span></p>
<p><span>We have had to put our lives on hold and have had to relocate from Houston, Texas to Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, to seek less evasive treatments in medication and a quality of life Maria deserves. She has endured countless hours of physical, occupational and speech therapies.  Her vision has improved and her confidence grows daily.</span></p>
<p><span>Although we have insurance our out of pocket cost runs nearly 18% for catastrophic illness.  To date we have incurred nearly 1.5 million in insurance claims.  I am a career employee of 25 years and have had to cash in my retirement, life policies, and both children's college funds.</span></p>
<p><span>We have sold our home, our cars, and our household goods and live day by day.  We will continue to fight to give Maria the quality of life she deserves and help find a cure for Myositis and its associated illnesses.</span></p>
<p><span>She has shown steady improvements but continues to have regular scheduled appointment, data is collected for case studies and monthly infusions via her Port-A-Cath placed under the skin with a visiting nurse, pump and medication, five days a month 2-5 hours a day. </span></p>

<p>Agua4All
addresses two significant public health concerns: free access to safe drinking
water and increased water consumption; both of which will increase up to 14,000
local residents’ overall health.</p>
<p>Residents currently do not have easy
access to safe drinking water at home or at the learning center. Their tap
water contains<b> high levels of arsenic</b>, a highly toxic element. A well at
the center holds treated water, but there isn’t any infrastructure to transport
the water to the taps. Because of your donation the community will finally have
access to potable water.</p>
<h3><b>Arsenic
and your health</b></h3>
<p>According to the World Health
Organization, long-term arsenic consumption <b>can cause cancer and skin
lesions</b>. Arsenic consumption also has been associated with developmental
defects, cardiovascular disease, neurotoxicity and diabetes.</p>
<h3><b>Obesity
and diabetes</b></h3><p>In addition,<b> limited water access
increases the risk for obesity and diabetes</b>,
because the nearest and most affordable drink is usually a sugary beverage. In
a recent California Health Interview Survey, <b>58 percent of Eastern Coachella
Valley children drank sugar-sweetened beverages</b> the day before the survey
was administered, as compared to just 40 percent of children surveyed
statewide. Further, in Coachella Valley more than <b>16 percent of children are
already overweight</b> and <b>37 percent are obese</b>, according to the Health
Assessment Resource Center. </p>
<h3><b>Your
contributions' ultimate benefits</b></h3>
<p>Access to safe drinking water, plus
education about the health benefits of drinking water, will help residents
improve their health, which ultimately leads to a better quality of life. </p>

<p><b>If we don't raise enough money</b></p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our
campaign goal, we will continue to seek funds to make this project happen.
However, it will delay these residents' access to safe drinking water. We also
may not be able to provide reusable water bottles to the community or provide
the necessary education needed to change the community's perception on drinking
water. Or, we may only be able to install one tap, which limits the community’s
access to clean drinking water. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/803521/files/20140821141808-Poster.jpg?1408655888"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3></h3>

<p>There’s normally more than one contributing factor to a good night’s sleep. If you have ever had a bad night’s sleep from being too hot or cold or suffered from back pain from an unsupportive mattress, or even been woken up by a partner snoring, Balluga is for you.</p>
<p>Balluga creates your ideal sleeping conditions to provide you with your best night’s sleep, every night. Balluga is the first truly smart bed that manages your total sleep experience in real-time, by monitoring your body’s vital statistics and adjusting its firmness, support and temperature to match your chosen settings throughout the night.</p>
<p>Balluga’s patented layers of air spring cells will ensure your bed remains as new and will not compress or sag over time. No more rolling into the middle dip of the bed, or hanging onto the sides of your mattress.</p>
<p>Balluga's design ethos will help to maintain your bedroom's ambiance by integrating all its technology within the bed to ensure it is invisible and silent during use.</p>

<p>The effects of lack of sleep to our mind and body on a day-to-day basis are cumulative. In one study, people who slept for six hours a night for two weeks performed as poorly on cognitive tests as those who stayed up for 24 hours. That holds true even if you don't feel particularly sleepy.</p>

<p>Balluga mattresses and bases are manufactured from a combination of natural and man made materials. They are all selected to be non allergenic and anti bacterial to deter any bacterial or bed bug infestation. All of our mattresses will comply with regional sleeping certifications and standards to ensure the highest level of hygienic sleeping conditions.</p>
<p>Balluga’s built in technology is inaccessible by design and is fused and insulated for ultimate safety. All the mattress, bed base controls and monitoring sensors run on 12V DC. The heating elements which are safely sealed within the bed base run on mains power. They are triple fused and triple insulated for optimum safety.</p>
<p>The Balluga sleep monitoring and operating systems have very low energy consumption as each feature of the mattress or base is normally operated for a limited amount of time throughout the night.</p>
<p>The maximum power loading if all the sleep features are operated simultaneously will not exceed 100W, while the heating elements can consume up to 1400W when the heating function is engaged. During normal use, only a fraction of the maximum energy output is utilised for a few seconds or minutes depending on the functions used.</p>

</div></div>","The Balluga Bed has already been featured in the following publications:





• Digital Trends - ""Easily the smartest bed we’ve seen yet... stupid beds have plenty to worry about.""

• The Verge - ""Feeling parts of the bed stiffen and relax underneath my limbs convinced me that this would be a very useful feature if you’re at all mattress-sensitive.""

• International Business Times - ""Trouble sleeping? Balluga smart bed 'with a brain' could banish those sleepless nights.""






There’s normally more than one contributing factor to a good night’s sleep. If you have ever had a bad night’s sleep from being too hot or cold or suffered from back pain from an unsupportive mattress, or even been woken up by a partner snoring, Balluga is for you.
Balluga creates your ideal sleeping conditions to provide you with your best night’s sleep, every night. Balluga is the first truly smart bed that manages your total sleep experience in real-time, by monitoring your body’s vital statistics and adjusting its firmness, support and temperature to match your chosen settings throughout the night.
Balluga’s patented layers of air spring cells will ensure your bed remains as new and will not compress or sag over time. No more rolling into the middle dip of the bed, or hanging onto the sides of your mattress.
Balluga's design ethos will help to maintain your bedroom's ambiance by integrating all its technology within the bed to ensure it is invisible and silent during use.



A smart bed with an array of smart features


Balluga's active suspension system monitors the pressure that your body places in different zones of the mattress. The air pressure is automatically increased or decreased in each zone, to ensure that your body and spine are always correctly supported.



Our unique suspension allows you to sleep on your back, side or front with equal comfort by reducing pressure under the heaviest parts of your body while providing additional support to its lightest parts.
Balluga's individual air cells are soft enough not to restrict healthy blood circulation while providing firm support for your entire body. Our hybrid mattress design of air cells and supporting foam layers ensures that our mattresses look and feel like any high quality mattress while providing an advanced computer monitored and controlled suspension system.


Balluga's suspension allows you to alter the firmness of your mattress every time you use it. This feature is available to use independently for each side of our double mattresses.



Control the firmness of your mattress with an App




A steady stream of air will keep your body at its optimum temperature throughout the night. Individual temperature levels can be set for each side of the mattress so no more arguing with your partner about who might be hogging the sheets, or waking up to kick them off.
The cool side of the pillow has never felt so good! 



Independent temperature control for each side of the bed.




Our pressure point vibro massage system will relax your muscles and allow you to drift to sleep or gently vibrate to wake you up in the morning. The massage system can also be preset to automatically shut down at a number of preset times.



 Balluga's Vibro Massage System



Our App is compatible for use on iOS and Android smartphones or tablets. Alternatively you can control the bed using our wireless touch screen control unit. Through our app, your preferred comfort and therapeutic settings can be saved and used on any other Balluga Bed worldwide. 









App pages for Firmness, Massage & Temperature control 



Our integrated sleep monitoring sensors are able to obtain a number of your vital statistics like your body temperature, heart rate and  even your room temperature. All this data can be analyzed and passed on to our active air suspension, temperature control and vibro massage systems, to automatically adjust them in real time to create your ideal sleep experience.

Balluga's real time sleep monitoring can help you relax and fall asleep faster and wake you up at a pre set time. By learning your sleep habits, it can help maximize the quality and depth of your sleep, as well as prevent any sleep interruptions over time.
All the vital statistics attained by Balluga bed can be integrated with other sleep apps on your smartphones, tablets and wearable devices. We're planning to work with a number of third party hardware developers to allow Balluga beds to interact in real time with other smart IOT home products like thermostats, lights, smoke alarms and locks.



Monitor your sleep cycles via the Balluga app



Balluga's anti-snoring technology will save you from being kept awake, or being kicked awake! Balluga's built in sound sensor will automatically detect the sound wave patterns of snoring. The air suspension sections below your head will then raise or lower your pillow until the snoring has stopped. This established method of varying the head position without interrupting sleep could be a marriage saving feature - you can thank us later!
 


Triggered Automatically by the Sound of Snoring



Our external movement sensor and built in LED lighting system can provide you with night-time illumination for when you need to get up in the dark of night. They will help you eliminate those painful toe-stubbing moments, or tripping over a sleeping pet. The LED lights can also be set to illuminate in a number of colors.

Air Circulation Demonstration

Thermal View of Heating & Cooling



We believe everyone is entitled to the best night's sleep that modern technology and design can offer and we have been developing Balluga for over seven years to make that possible.
We have reached the fully working, market ready product stage and had a successful Kickstarter campaign to allow us to bring Balluga beds into full production and into people's bedrooms worldwide.
We are are now very excited to bring Balluga to Indiegogo InDemand to allow others to support us at some new pledge levels. We would love to hear your feedback, so please get in touch and tell us what you think! 





The effects of lack of sleep to our mind and body on a day-to-day basis are cumulative. In one study, people who slept for six hours a night for two weeks performed as poorly on cognitive tests as those who stayed up for 24 hours. That holds true even if you don't feel particularly sleepy.










Balluga mattresses and bases are manufactured from a combination of natural and man made materials. They are all selected to be non allergenic and anti bacterial to deter any bacterial or bed bug infestation. All of our mattresses will comply with regional sleeping certifications and standards to ensure the highest level of hygienic sleeping conditions.
Balluga’s built in technology is inaccessible by design and is fused and insulated for ultimate safety. All the mattress, bed base controls and monitoring sensors run on 12V DC. The heating elements which are safely sealed within the bed base run on mains power. They are triple fused and triple insulated for optimum safety.
The Balluga sleep monitoring and operating systems have very low energy consumption as each feature of the mattress or base is normally operated for a limited amount of time throughout the night.
The maximum power loading if all the sleep features are operated simultaneously will not exceed 100W, while the heating elements can consume up to 1400W when the heating function is engaged. During normal use, only a fraction of the maximum energy output is utilised for a few seconds or minutes depending on the functions used.





Balluga beds have a 10 year limited warranty for all mattresses and bases which covers all materials, components and workmanship subject to normal wear and tear. This limited Warranty extends to the original purchaser and not to any third party.

Balluga mattresses must be used normally for their intended purposes and on a bed base that is level flat and structurally capable of supporting the weight of the Mattress and its user(s).


Balluga’s limited warranty does not cover any physical abuse or damage to the structure and/or cover material, including but not limited to, misuse, burns, cuts, tears, liquid damage, or stains; provided, that the defect is caused by such abuse or damage.

Meddy's Mission is to help kids around the world lead healthier, more loving lives through yoga, meditation, and mindfulness practices.
The secret is out: scientific studies abound that support yoga and mindfulness have very real and measurable positive effects on young minds and bodies. To name a few:

Improves academic performance, learning & memory
Improves self-control
Reduces anger, anxiety and depression
Increases self-esteem

Improves social skills, respect for others                           



                 

⬆ #YogaWithMeddy Instagram Challenge ⬆


 
 
 

 
How do we create a better place for our children and our children’s children? The answer may not be simple, but one thing is clear. We have to start now. We have to start with the children of today and teach healthy habits that will benefit the children of tomorrow. 




 
 
 


Meddy Teddy helps parents and teachers broach big topics like mindfulness, self-trust, and peacefulness—just to name a few—in a way that kids find accessible and fun. And Yoga is a perfect low-impact, gateway to fitness that can teach kids the importance of flexibility, muscle development and positive body image.

 
          
Meddy Teddy is proud to announce a partnership with Yoga Foster! http://www.yogafoster.org/                                  
                                   
 
Yoga Foster is a non-profit organization working to help teachers start yoga programs in their classrooms during the school day.Through training, curriculum and yoga mats, teachers teach movement and mindfulness.
 
And it's 100% free for teachers at Title 1 schools! If you support through our $50 level, you'll get a Meddy Teddy AND give one child the gift of yoga for an entire YEAR! 
 
                    
                  
                       

On May 1st, 2016 our 15,000$ goal was hit!!!!!!!! Thank you all so beary beary much!! 
 The love from around the world is so inspiring and encouraging. 
We have 15 days left!!!
Meddy wants to double the raised to 30K, so he can get to everyone faster!
Our most important goal is to use the money we raise to fund our first big round of production for Meddy Teddy. 
Afterwards, create ""Meddy Teddy's Mindful Yoga Flow"" book and ""A Mindful Journey Begins"" story book. Once the characters are more developed, we plan to produce a short animated series.
 
 

""If every 8 year old in the world is taught meditation, we will eliminate violence from the world within one generation.""
Help us make a major impact in the lives of the children of today and tomorrow.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a personal pledge taken by me. The neighbor who was targeted and had his beloved classic collectible Tampa Bay Buccaneers FootBall Helmet sign stolen is a member of the ""lower class"", as am I. By chance, his name is Amos Wallace. The video tape shows that on the night in question, which was back in October of 2012, Raymond Martineau stole his sign. Amos wants his original sign back and had Ray arrested. Bond was set at 30,000.00, along with misdemeanor domestic abuse and theft and running from a police officer. It's an old story and Ray has jousted with justice for years and been in and out of prison. </p>
<p>It's one of the reasons he has this sense of entitlement. After Wade died though (the scenario where it was just Wade and Ray and I still wonder), he's just gotten meaner and more in people's faces and that is bad. Ray needs to go away and he's playing the system. Amos has to take days off of work, without pay.</p>
<p>I propose that WE pay Amos Wallace for any work  days missed in June (about 4-5), so we can put this little psychopath, back behind bars, where he belongs. If possible, I propose to also appear as a character witness.</p>
<p>I'm pretty good with things like this, although I have never done and Indiegogo. The neighbors thought it was a good idea. As we have the crime on tape, I'm not perjuring myself and will testify only to what I've observed.</p>
<p>I was in the homeless shelter when Ray lived there and I can attest to his cold attitude and ways. He never hesitated to run down his girlfriend of the moment when she was not in earshot. He constantly begged for money and if  it wasn't forthcoming, he would berate us as if we should be falling all over ourselves to give him 20 cents. He's broken into people's houses and he stole people's wallets in the shelter. He would steal and sell other people's bus passes and bicycles.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> </p>
<h2><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why is it Important?</span></h2>
<p>MIM for MOM encourages breastfeeding, which provides babies with irreproducible proteins, nutrients, antibodies and growth factors as well as enhancing brain, immune and gut development. Research shows that for infants not being breastfed results in elevated risks of childhood obesity, diabetes, leukemia and sudden infant death syndrome. For mothers, the lack of breastfeeding is associated with an increased incidence of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, weight gain and diabetes.</p>

<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How Does MIM for MOM Work?</span></strong></h2>
<p>MIM for MOM is made up of (i) a necklace-based device and (ii) disposable components, which are the nipple dressings. These dressings are ultra-flat and narrow pads whose unique design enables lactation to be done in a natural manner since there is direct contact between a mom's breasts and her baby's lips and mouth. The mom takes a nipple addressing from a sterile pocket, wears it on her breast/s and breastfeeds the baby. As soon as the lactation ends, she throws the dressing to the trash.</p>

<p>Here’s more detail from one of our team members, Ms. <strong>Tali Gassner</strong>, who is a Certified Breastfeeding Counselor and a mother of two, on how MIM for MOM works:  </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>“It is basically an ultra thin strip of silicone-like material that is pressed on the breast covering part of the areola, but with a hole for the nipple. The display is attached to this strip by the necklace (that's the part that does the magic and manages to calculate the amount of milk the baby has gotten out of the breast). The great part is that we can actually show in real-time the amount of milk being nursed out of the breast, but the baby won't feel anything different than if the MIM for MOM weren't there! Only part of the areola is covered (and even that part is covered by an ultra thin layer) so the baby still feels and smells his mom. The nipple is not covered so the milk can flow freely. Each measuring strip comes in a sterile package and is for single use, to ensure the best level of accuracy and cleanliness for mom and baby. With the device we have currently built we reached a level of 97% in the measurement of milk. Once we have this funding, I believe the accuracy will be even higher since we can have the devices built more precisely.”</em></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sue and I am a Registerd Nurse in Wilmington, Delaware. I have been invited to participate in a charitable medical mission to Oyo State in Nigeria where we will provide free medical care for the people there and training to local medical personnel.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why I Need Money and What It's For</h3>
<p>Although all my expenses are paid by Premier Charities Inc (the 501c(3) organization sponsoring the trip) once I am in Nigeria, I am responsible for all expenses associated with getting there and back:</p>
<ul>
<li>Round-trip airfare</li>
<li>Nigerian visa application</li>
<li>Mandatory vaccinations</li>
<li>Nigerian medical license</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>This 2-week medical mission will provide free medical care in one of the poorest and most populous countries in the world. It will also help in training local doctors and nurses in modern western medical practices.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>It Only Takes A Little</h3>
<p>Donations of any amount will help. If I can get just 230 people to donate an average of just $10 each, I will have the money I need to take this trip and help  hundreds of people live healthier lives.</p>
<h3>If I Don't Reach My Goal</h3>
<p>If I am unable to collect the full amount required to go, and can't supplement the difference myself, I will donate any amount collected to Premier Charities for use in buying medical supplies to be donated to the Nigerian hospitals and clinics that will be hosting our group.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Danielle DeRuiter-Williams. I work for a state-wide non-profit advocacy organization focused on improving health policy at the local level. Outside of my ""day job"" I am pursuing a business degree at Mills College in Oakland where I will focus on microenterprise, entrepreneurship and improving health and wellness outcomes for underserved communities. </p>
<p>The connection between physical, mental and spiritual health is undeniable and to me, yoga practice can be the key for many communities to unlock their potential. I want to help them do that. But first I have to have the proper qualifications to do so.</p>
<p>I first became passionate about the importance of health and wellness including fitness and yoga practice after a severe back injury with which I have been coping for the last 2+ years. I recognized how much chronic pain can impact a formerly highly productive individual's ability to complete even the most basic of tasks. At 25 years old I often found walking too painful to bear.

BACKGROUND
Dear Friend,
Do you know what it means to be in excruciating PAIN!

I do, I have seen it too many times. My name is Ajarat and I have been a nurse for over six years now. My first nursing job was at one of the nations leading Cancer Centers in Pennsylvania. It was a life changing experience for me where I learnt of the different kinds of cancers that exist and the very difficult Chemotherapy and Radiation treatment regimens that cancer patients have to go through. But one thing that stood out for a young nurse in training at that time was seeing what it meant to be in pain. Cancer can be very very PAINFUL!


Khadijah-Mobolaji is  a 35 year old mother of one who is currently at a hospital in India undergoing treatment for Tissue Sarcoma. The next line of treatment in her battle with this disease includes a surgical procedure to place an implant in her lumbar area to alleviate the excruciating pains she is feeling in her limbs. This is needed before another chemotherapy treatment regimen can take place. The costs for this is $16000 but I am hoping together, we can help raise at least $5000 towards it in the next 21 days.


Your Prayers and good wishes will also go a long way. Everyone can give something! If enough of us get behind it, we can help Khadijat get the much needed surgery to alleviate her pain and get on with beating this  Cancer!

If you need more pertinent information about Khadijat and her plan of care at the hospital, alternative ways to send in your donations or want to share your two cents on how we can reach this goal faster, please contact me by email at ajaratbada@gmail.com

<p>We just completed our amazing project in Bihar, India.  YOU CAN STILL DONATE to this highly
effective project via our Indiegogo fundraising campaign, which will end on
September 21, 2014.  If you’d like
to donate beyond this date, please contact me directly.  Here is an overview of our last few
days in Bihar:</p>
<p>After working 6 days straight and saying goodbye to Sahar, on
Sunday I took a bit more time to rest and recover from a cold. The day was
spent doing laundry, resting and observing and participating in other daily
chores and activities with the survivors and staff. In the evening we all sat
on the grass talking and playing the harmonium. Monday, I arose early to attend
the 6:00am morning yoga class and was quite unexpectedly asked to teach it! It
was a great opportunity to integrate some of the body focus stabilization
skills we had worked with earlier in the group’s sessions. Then, I worked a
long day giving individual sessions to many of the survivors helping them with
the symptoms they struggle with most. Many of them experienced nightmares,
extreme fears, and feeling sad often. One survivor reported feeling “stuck”
when faced with stressful situations. It was good to have one-on-one time with
them to explain about the effects of trauma and to teach them how to support
regulating their bodies. I focused on helping them to stabilize and to feel a
sense of internal power and containment, while also taking some time just to listen
to them and to be with them, as some disclosed things they had never spoken to
anyone about before. The day ended with a final meeting with the Amita, the
coordinator and Deepshikka, the case-worker, as well as Mr. Dubey. This
valuable time was spent on program development, which included reviewing and
organizing all they had learned, and incorporating it into the overall
treatment program. I also helped them to understand the importance of the
phases of treatment and to develop realistic goals. We set goals for individuals
and the group as a whole, particularly related to behavioral problems/anger, building
ego strength/resources, and stabilization. Late that evening, I prepared for my
departure from the Punarnawa Ashram Shelter and early the next day was escorted
to the Bagdogra airport (3 hour drive) by Mr. Dubey, another field officer, and
the driver.</p>
<p>Today, Sat. Sept. 20, 2014 -  I am writing from Lhamo’s Croissants in Dharamsala (thank
you to Glyndie Nickerson, SEP, for this recommendation!). I would like to thank
all of the donors who made this trip possible. Sahar and I, as well as the
Punarnawa Ashram and Free the Slaves, are very grateful for your help. The
ashram staff has been in dire need for more training and more help with the
survivors. They told us they found our training to be very helpful. They greatly
appreciated our warm and friendly style of relating and teaching and reported
to us that they learned a lot about trauma and how to better support the
survivors. </p>
<p>Your donations have made a tremendous difference in these
people’s lives.  Thanks for your
financial support that makes this all possible!</p>

Throughout this past week we have continued to hold trainings and small groups to discuss the traumatic effects and healing of sex trafficking. The staff had many questions related to specific survivors, as well as general questions around managing behavior and building relationships in the face of the extreme disregulation that comes with trauma. Some of the areas we helped them with included understanding the relationship between trauma and its influence on behavior and learning, how to help the children bring their bodies/nervous system’s back into balance, how to recognize and address their own secondary trauma, how to “shape” children’s behaviors, the importance of team work and clarification of their roles, the importance of empathic/reflective listening, when to refer for medication, how to respond when the child has nightmares or other more severe manifestations of trauma, and learning the stages of child development, as well the principles of play and art therapy.

They all seem to appreciate our help with their post traumatic stress and need it very much. Their bright smiles belie the deep suffering they harbor.

Punarnawa Ashram Shelter  in
Purnea, Bihar. The Ashram is set in a remote area to keep the girls as safe as
possible, and the barbed wire on the walls as well as the guards at the gates
also ensure this safety. On our drive to the Ashram, we drove through flood
damaged roads surrounded by beautiful lush green fields and rice patties of the
village outside the compound. We were graciously welcomed by the staff and
spent the first day getting to know them, having them get used to us, and
setting the agenda for the week’s training. They then gave us a tour of their
facility which included the classrooms for vocational training and education,
and the organic farming and animal husbandry areas, equipped with solar panels
and a bio diesel system. We then spent a few hours discussing the residents and
the challenges they face. We were informed that at least 4-6 of the current
residents were rescued from the local red light district in Purnea that was
pointed out to us. Others come from neighboring districts and other parts of
India and Nepal, such as Bangladesh and Uttar Pradesh. We ended the day with an
uplifting and hopeful story about 3 sisters that had been trafficked
separately, who through the anti-trafficking system had been rescued and
reunited at the Ashram. They are now awaiting the arrival of their 4<sup>th</sup>
sister who was trafficked to Nepal where she has been rescued. Upon her arrival
they will be all be reintegrated together and able to start a new life. In the
days that followed, we led an all staff training and two group trainings. There
we introduced important concepts and exercises in working with the mind body
connection in survivors of trauma. We are looking forward to continuing to
support staff in integrating theses learning’s as well as providing group and
individual sessions with the residents as they warm to our presence. Thank you
for your support and the generous contributions that made this all possible. We
will continue to update as much as possible given the remote setting and the

<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Free The Slaves (FTS) (<a href=""http://www.freetheslaves.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.freetheslaves.net</a>) has invited myself,
Beth Nielsen (California, USA),
Lotus Circle International founder and trauma therapist, and Dr. Sahar Bhaloo (Mumbai,
India), psychologist and global mental
health consultant, to offer staff and residents of the shelter cutting edge
clinical training, consultation and treatment in
somatically-based psychotherapeutic work that will facilitate trauma healing
and empowerment.</p>
<p>Residents are experiencing severe
symptoms of post-traumatic stress and are in need of skilled psychotherapy
support for trauma recovery. The highly dedicated staff of this clinic includes
one mental health caseworker with limited clinical training and others who
provide practical and logistical support to the caseworker.  FTS and the staff themselves have
recognized the critical need to recruit a qualified mental
health counselor for the recovery home, but no one has been willing to come to
live in this remote area.</p>
<p>This project is aimed at providing
in-depth training to the case worker as well as other shelter staff, in
trauma-healing skills which will help the girls suffering with symptoms of post
traumatic stress (PTSD), as well as the staff experiencing vicarious traumatization. </p>
<p>DETAILS
ABOUT THIS PROJECT</p>
<p>We
will be sharing our expertise by offering two weeks of training, consultation,
program development, and treatment to staff and the women and girls. Trainings
will focus on trauma healing and empowerment with a psycho-biologically based therapy
known as Somatic Experiencing, as well as other trauma focused methods. </p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>Sex
traffickers target young people who are desperate for a better life, as well as
families that find it hard to feed their children. In 2004, Free the Slaves
began a major program to eradicate trafficking from Bihar, India, where the population
of over 83 million, are among the poorest in the world. </p>

We just completed our amazing project in Bihar, India.  YOU CAN STILL DONATE to this highly
effective project via our Indiegogo fundraising campaign, which will end on
September 21, 2014.  If you’d like
to donate beyond this date, please contact me directly.  Here is an overview of our last few
days in Bihar:
After working 6 days straight and saying goodbye to Sahar, on
Sunday I took a bit more time to rest and recover from a cold. The day was
spent doing laundry, resting and observing and participating in other daily
chores and activities with the survivors and staff. In the evening we all sat
on the grass talking and playing the harmonium. Monday, I arose early to attend
the 6:00am morning yoga class and was quite unexpectedly asked to teach it! It
was a great opportunity to integrate some of the body focus stabilization
skills we had worked with earlier in the group’s sessions. Then, I worked a
long day giving individual sessions to many of the survivors helping them with
the symptoms they struggle with most. Many of them experienced nightmares,
extreme fears, and feeling sad often. One survivor reported feeling “stuck”
when faced with stressful situations. It was good to have one-on-one time with
them to explain about the effects of trauma and to teach them how to support
regulating their bodies. I focused on helping them to stabilize and to feel a
sense of internal power and containment, while also taking some time just to listen
to them and to be with them, as some disclosed things they had never spoken to
anyone about before. The day ended with a final meeting with the Amita, the
coordinator and Deepshikka, the case-worker, as well as Mr. Dubey. This
valuable time was spent on program development, which included reviewing and
organizing all they had learned, and incorporating it into the overall
treatment program. I also helped them to understand the importance of the
phases of treatment and to develop realistic goals. We set goals for individuals
and the group as a whole, particularly related to behavioral problems/anger, building
ego strength/resources, and stabilization. Late that evening, I prepared for my
departure from the Punarnawa Ashram Shelter and early the next day was escorted
to the Bagdogra airport (3 hour drive) by Mr. Dubey, another field officer, and
the driver.
Today, Sat. Sept. 20, 2014 -  I am writing from Lhamo’s Croissants in Dharamsala (thank
you to Glyndie Nickerson, SEP, for this recommendation!). I would like to thank
all of the donors who made this trip possible. Sahar and I, as well as the

Our Approach
The development of a trauma
sensitive recovery program at the shelter will start with two weeks of training
in a cutting edge psycho-physiological (mind-body)
method of healing post traumatic stress, and training for all staff in basic
counseling skills, case management skills, documentation training, as well as
training for incorporating trauma healing principles in all daily activities.
We also plan to provide ongoing consultation for continued program development
and clinical support. Both staff and residents will be
taught to utilize these skills to stabilize themselves when they feel emotional
and physical distress. This is a holistic approach that empowers people from
the inside out. 
HOW
FUNDS WILL BE USED
Monies raised will be used to cover
basic expenses for arranging trauma specific training by expert consultants (including
airfare, basic lodging upon arrival, ground transportation, and food).
Additional monies raised will go to support general operating expenses for Lotus
Circle International, as well as future trainings and consultations for the
Punarnawa Shelter or other LCI projects for underserved populations worldwide. 
You can also help us by spreading the word about this project and using the Indiegogo sharing tools! Please help us bring these girls and staff the vital resources and support they need so they can return to their homes and lead productive and healthy lives!
In peace,
Beth Nielsen, MFT

so very much for taking the time to look at this Campaign. This Campaign
 is to help raise money to help with all the expenses that unfortunately
 go along with the horrible horrible disease Cancer! My Mom was 
diagnosed in December 2012, we did have a Campaign shortly after we 
found out she was diagnosed and we do want to thank everyone who 
donated! It has now been a Year and a Half and bills, gas money to 
downtown Detroit, Medication, and needed expenses all add up very very 
fast, not to mention we ended up having to get a new vehicle (a ""new"" 
used vehicle lol) so we could get my Mom to and from Khemo reliably, so 
we really need to reach out to everyone and try and raise Donations to 
help her to continue her treatments, etc. It is really hard for us 
financially because not only does my my Mom has Stage 3 Cancer, My Dad 
and I are also both disabled. When my Mom was first diagnosed she was 
told she had Stomach Cancer, after Months (and a new Doctor) we have now
 found out she has Stage 3 Ovarian Cancer. She has been going through 
lots of Khemo and Treatments, and has had surgery to try and get rid of 
this horrible thing, but unfortunately her numbers are going back up and
 she is now receiving Aggressive Khemo to try and nip this thing in the 
butt! I have left My Mom and our Families Story below so anyone who has 
not read it can still have the chance to read it and see how much of a 
wonderful Woman my Mom is and how Dear she is to my Father and I's Heart
 and also everyone around her! Thank you again for looking and reading, 
and if you can afford to make a small donation it would mean A LOT, and 
if you can't afford a donation, please donate 30 seconds of your time 
and share this link anywhere you can! It can be accessed from <a href=""http://www.4Lynnette.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.4Lynnette.com</a><br/><br/><br/><h2><strong><em>Original Story-</em></strong></h2>
<p>The next few minutes are for anyone 
who cares enough to take the next few minutes of their life to read 
about a women who deserves every minute you give her! My name is 
Richard, son of Lynnette and Johnny. I really have no idea where to 
begin, my parents are quite literally my best friends and I would not 
change it for a thing. In this Campaign I went further then just ""asking
 for donations"", I want this Campaign to tell my Moms story!</p>
<p>Let start in 1983 when my Mom Lynnette 
just found out she was pregnant. This is a time when most women are so 
very much happy and excited, and I am sure my Mom had felt the same way,
 but behind all that excitement still laid a feeling that NO women wants
 to feel. To explain what I mean, I need to take you back even further, 
when my Mom was 9 years old she was diagnosed with Kidney Disease. She 
spent her whole childhood in &amp; out of hospitals, surgery's and 
transplants. By the age of 13 she has went through more then most people
 need to go through in a life time 10 times over, and over the years she
 has had TWO transplants, the years following I am sure she was excited 
that the 2nd transplant was doing well, but the disease also left her 
with a lifetime of other problems like very low immune system, life long
 medications, other complications including NOT having children. So when
 my Mom found out she was pregnant with me....a time when a woman is 
suppose to be on top of the world, the doctors are telling her she 
CANNOT have me, but against ALL the doctors NO's my Mom stood tall and 
told them all that she did not care the risks to herself, if the baby 
would be healthy is all she cared about, so putting ALL her problems and
 health aside for me, she went on with the pregnancy. Sure there were 
some complications, and some problems here and there but she said strong
 through the whole process and never once put herself before me, she 
quite literally was 100% willing to give her own life, to give life to 
her baby son....ME, and I will never ever forget that.</p>
<p>Through the years our Family has had many
 many downs, but I would trade nothing for all the great UP's that we 
had as well! Though my Mom had a hard childhood that led to a rough 
adulthood, she always gave her heart to the people around her. When I 
was 5 years old my Father was in a very bad accident that left him with a
 broken back and broken neck that led to MANY MANY surgeries, and even 
though my Mom had so many things to worry about with herself she still 
stood by his side through every single one of those surgeries giving her
 support, help and love to him and I, taking care of ANYTHING that 
needed to be done, paying bills, working 2 jobs to pay bills, driving to
 hospitals, running the house! She did ANYTHING the family needed, 
because she cared! My Father and I can not thank her enough, nor would a
 thanks be close to enough. My Father still of course has many problems 
and is still to this day having surgeries to help with the problems, and
 even now 20 years later my Mom STILL does everything she can for him 
and I.</p>
<p>In 2005 another tragedy struck when I was
 in a very severe high speed motorcycle accident that left me 
hospitalized for a month, and after discharged I needed home care for 
the next year. The hospital recommended a temp home, or a full time 
nurse to help, but my Mom INSISTED that she help her baby boy, she spent
 the next year of her life changing bandages and taking care of me in 
ANYWAY that she could, because that is just the type of wonderful person
 she is. How do you thank someone for something like that? And again 
same as my Father, to this day...even 8 years later I still have chronic
 pain and problems, and again still to this day my Mom gives her heart 
to make sure she does everything she can to make my life just that much 
better. And I truly cannot ever thank her enough for everything she has 
done and continues TO do for me. A few years after my accident, my Mom 
was in a accident as well that ended up totaling her pick-up truck and 
left her with chronic back pain and has also had a knee replacement, but
 even with those problems piled on to everything else....she STILL 
stands strong and gives 100% to the Family.</p>
<p>Then in 2006 my Grandma became ill, and 
my Mom being the wonderful person she was, stopped working and basically
 moved in with my Grandma (Her Mother). She lived with my Grandmother 
for about 80% of the time for the next 2 years, and helped my 
Grandmother is any and every way she could, driving her, cleaning her, 
cleaning her house, laundry, pay bills and everything else needed to 
make my Grandmas life just that much easier for her, ALL on top of still
 taking care of my Father and I all at the same time, I truly do not 
know how she did it, I think she is secretly superwoman, and if shes 
not....then she is 100% still Superwoman in my eyes that is for sure. 
Unfortunately my Grandmother passed away, and that was very hard on my 
Mom, and still is, but again my Mom stands strong giving 100% to us, and
 again....how on earth does someone show how much that means to them? It
 means the world to me, and I hope she realizes that.</p>
<p>You normally would think that....come on,
 this Family has been through enough, they lived happily ever 
after.....right? Unfortunately, this is not the way the cards fell. 
December 19th, 2012, my Mom was diagnosed with Stomach Cancer <b><i>(Updat</i><i>e: her new amazing Doctor, Dr. Seward, found that it was actually Ovarian Cancer and performed her surgery too)</i></b>, its is 
very hard to come to terms with this because although NO person deserves
 that horrible disease, but I think she truly deserves to NOT have been 
burdened with this, she has been through to much to deal her such cards.
 She will be spending time going through surgeries and tests, chemo, 
etc. &amp; she is tough enough that I know she will beat it, but I also 
wanted to come here to let the world know the wonderful person she is, 
and hope she will be in everyone's prayers and thoughts. Unfortunately 
my Mom has NO insurance <b>(Update: my Mom has recently been put on Medicaid)</b>, and I need to reach out more then ever for a 
helping hand from ANYONE who has a hand to give. Family, Friends, and 
Strangers alike, I think my Mom Lynnette DESERVES more then anyone to 
NOT have to have this burden on her shoulders and I would like for this 
Campaign to get as Viral as possible to not only tell her story and show
 my everlasting love. But I also truly believe that my Mom 100% DESERVES
 a break, I would not only like this campaign to generate enough money 
to help pay doctors, hospitals, prescriptions and treatments, BUT I also
 would love for it to generate enough money for her to just get away for
 awhile.......relax.....really truly take a break, she has been working 
NON STOP since 9 years old....Don t you think she FINALLY deserves a 
vacation?</p>
<p>Please help in anyway you can! If all you
 can do is pass this campaign on to someone else, then PLEASE do. If you
 can afford to donate then by all means, PLEASE do. Lynnette really 
deserves SO much more, but if telling her story and reaching a helping 
hand makes a big enough difference to lift just SOME of that burden, 
then at least I feel like I have just STARTED the process of repaying my
 Mom for all the Love, Blood, Sweat, Tears and more Love that my Mom has
 given me my entire life! I want her Positive, Standing Strong and 
Determined, the last thing I want on her mind is how bills are going to 
be paid, she has other things to focus on right now! Thank you for 
taking the time to read this, and again please help in anyway possible, 
if you know her at all you KNOW she more then deserves the help and if 
you do not know her, I hope you feel like you do know her enough now to 
know that she deserves all the help that is given.</p>
<p><strong>I have Faith my Mom will handle 
this like she has handled all the other hurdles in her life, and beat 
it! But every prayer helps!</strong></p>
<p>Again Thank you.</p>

<p>The dogs were killed instantly and Harrison's leg was severed while trying to protect Gemily who was still severely injured. Gemily has recently been released from the hospital but will face months of physical therapy. Harison is still in critical but stable condition and will likely face several more surgeries.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Shola McCarthy. You know as I was growing up I was hoping one day I would have a son of my own. My father had 6 boys and we all had girls. We was starting to believe we was cursed. Then my 1st born son Chinedu was born which means God leads. Then 2 years later I was blessed again with another son his name is Tobechi. Which means praising God. This son was different. He spend his 1st week of life in ICU and he was a full term baby. The doctor gave us the news. Our son was born with a genetic disorder called Trisomy 21. I was completely destroyed by this news and confused. Why is God punishing me through my son? I had to takw time to think and realized what a blessing he is.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The 1st question I had to ask is What is Trisomy 21? Trisomy Is a genetic disorder in your chromosomes. Every man and woman is born with 46 chromosomes. 23 chromsomes from each parent. So from 1 to 23 you should have 2 one from mom and one from dad. Now on the 21st chromsome my son Tobechi have 3 giving him 47 instead of 46. This disorder is commonly known as downs syndrome. Over 400,000 people are effected by it. It's hard for scientist to tell which parent spawn off the extra chromsome. All they could tell us was that he's was random that his mother was highly unlikely to have another child with trisomy 21 if she decided to have another. So many doctors appointments, lost of income, and the uncertainty off his future and children like him affects me deeply.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What </h3>
<p>We are trying to raise $15,000,000 to build and finance a facility.$250,000 from this site. This facility would provide OT, PT, Speech Therapy, and educational developmental skills training. So many people are in that grey area with INS. You make too much for medicaid, ins don't cover much or to expensive, or worse U just got a job, but they won't pick your child up because of the preexisting condition. This Facility would allow all to have proper care.This facility would also have an outreach program and financial planning. Whatever is given will be used for a greater purpose. Our 1st goal is to reach 40,000. Those who gave $10 or more will be given and opportunity to win a $gift cards, an ipad2, a 60inch LG flat screen T.V, and a 2009 Nissan Murano Still looking like new. Our gift to you for your love and support.<br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Darius Lewis and I'm 12 years old and I would like to become a professional soccer player one day in the not too distant future. I started competitive soccer at the age of 7 and have been the leading goal scorer on my team over the past 5 years. I have recently been selected to represent Florida Region III through the ODP program this summer in Alabama and have been invited to participate at the West Ham International Academy in Georgia also this summer. One of my major highlights of my short soccer career is when I got an invitation from the US Soccer Federation to participate at their US Training Centers which is geared to replicate National Team Training. I am currently in 6th Grade at West Gate K8 and have managed to maintain a 4.0 GPA during the past school year. I have recently been identified and invited to join the European Soccer Club in Miami which is coached by Master Carlos Cantarero who is a former coach at Atleco Madrid in Spain.</p>
<p>I truly will appreciate all the help I can get from all my family, friends and those now getting to know me in trying to reach my financial goal so that I can make my soccer dream a reality and it all begins this summer. I sincerely thank you all in advance and I'll continue my hard work and dedication both on and off the field of play and promise to make each and everyone of you proud of me both as a player and a person.</p>

<h3>Who is EEM Collection and what the heck is its purpose?</h3>
<span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: andale mono,times;"">A former MAC addict turned natural beauty expert, eco-preneur, and green girl newbie, Mindy Perez is a refreshingly down-to-earth mom of 3 who oozes with creativity and radiates enthusiasm when she speaks of her ""organically couture cosmetics"" boutique and <a href=""http://www.evokeelegance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color: #d52989;"">EEM Collection </span></a> products. </span></span>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: andale mono,times;"">Having lost both her parents to cancer, she has devoted her life to doing everything in her power to educate her family of 5 and all others about toxins and carcinogens we all involuntarily (and voluntarily) expose ourselves to on a daily basis and how to best avoid them - beginning with what's lurking in your bathroom cabinets and on your vanity. </span></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div><span style=""font-size: small;""><span style=""font-family: andale mono,times;"">For years, Mindy has sought organic shampoos, conditioners, lotions, etc. that ACTUALLY work in order to slowly make the necessary changes to avoid absorbing the chemicals hiding in heavily marketed, popular cosmetics. She found many but, still, the organic and natural cosmetics available in the marketplace lacked a certain pizzazz that a now reformed MAC addict (who is far from a hippie) longed for. That is the very reason <a href=""http://www.evokeelegance.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color: #d52989;"">EEM Collection</span></a> was born -to be both green and glam! Being able to create looks from au natural to couture with a complete variety of safe, high quality products is needed to help turn the girliest of girls and makeup divas to organic &amp; natural cosmetics as well!</span></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>

<p>So you just can’t contribute - believe me, I get it, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help out:</p>

</div>
<p> </p></div>","Who is EEM Collection and what the heck is its purpose?
A former MAC addict turned natural beauty expert, eco-preneur, and green girl newbie, Mindy Perez is a refreshingly down-to-earth mom of 3 who oozes with creativity and radiates enthusiasm when she speaks of her ""organically couture cosmetics"" boutique and EEM Collection  products. 

 
Having lost both her parents to cancer, she has devoted her life to doing everything in her power to educate her family of 5 and all others about toxins and carcinogens we all involuntarily (and voluntarily) expose ourselves to on a daily basis and how to best avoid them - beginning with what's lurking in your bathroom cabinets and on your vanity. 
 
For years, Mindy has sought organic shampoos, conditioners, lotions, etc. that ACTUALLY work in order to slowly make the necessary changes to avoid absorbing the chemicals hiding in heavily marketed, popular cosmetics. She found many but, still, the organic and natural cosmetics available in the marketplace lacked a certain pizzazz that a now reformed MAC addict (who is far from a hippie) longed for. That is the very reason EEM Collection was born -to be both green and glam! Being able to create looks from au natural to couture with a complete variety of safe, high quality products is needed to help turn the girliest of girls and makeup divas to organic & natural cosmetics as well!
 

That being said, Mindy sincerely believes that cosmetics should provide care for your outside not fill a void on the inside. Makeup should be used to enhance your natural beauty, used as an art form, and used just for FUN! Go bare with potent skincare or go glam with pigments and bronzers for heavy contouring. It is for these reasons EEM Collection's Mineral Cosmetics were created!  LOVE yourself and take care of what you have been blessed with - YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL!
Where your generous funds will go:


All contributions will be used to further develop the EEM cosmetic line, professionally bulk screen print on containers (rather than labels), implement the EEM skin care line, heavy marketing to get the brand name recognized, hire a professional photographer and models, and generate/revamp the EEM website.
Everyone knows the organic/natural makeup and skincare market is highly competitive but who wants boring and dull or overpriced items?!  I want to go head to head with MAC's line and be bold and daring but NON-TOXIC. 
EEM's Impact
EEM will very soon be working closely with a non-profit organization that will visit cancer patients in need.  We are passionate about our purpose to spread the word on how chemicals in cosmetics can negatively impact our systems.  We strive to begin:

Educating patients (and young people in general) on the importance of reading personal care product labels and haing the knowledge to decifer the good from the horribly ugly ingredients
Helping people make the right natural/organic choices to limit their exposure to unnecessary toxins
Assist cancer patients with choosing the right wigs for them after they lose their hair from chemo/radiation
Teaching cancer patients how to apply non-toxic makeup to their brow area to  build confidence
Helping them choose the right skincare for them and will be putting together complimentary care baskets to soothe their aching feet, dry skin patches and overall changes they may be experiencing due to cancer treatment
 
My admiration of nature's treasures:
Quite intrigued by the remarkable healing and all around beneficial properties of nature's blessings and elegant splendor of beautifying plants, fruits, and vegetables, I took my creativity to the next level when I honed my skills of mixing body creams and mineral makeup with my understanding of superior skin nourishing ingredients to create beauty potion ""works of art"" with my EEM Collection line.
As my knowledge of ingredients grew, so did my demand for higher quality products. My passion will always be far from just creating ""safer and purer natural products"" but instead to formulate truly beneficial, powerful skincare and cosmetics that will heal, nuture, and beautify the skin.
EEM Collection formulas are natural and as organic as possible and always free of petrochemicals, all known carcinogens, parabens, sulfates, phlataltes, mineral oil, and genetically modified ingredients. Our ingredients and formulas are never tested on animals. We make our products with the highest quality ingredients using only natural plant oils, bases, and essences that are certified organic, wildcrafted, and/or all natural.

<p>This year, Villanova Quidditch has taken our competitive aspect to the next level. We won every tournament we entered this fall, including outlasting the entire Mid-Atlantic Region in November to be crowned the first United States Regional Champions in the history of Quidditch!</p>

<p>  Hi, We are having  a fundraiser for Tray Garabedian he has genetic Polycystic kidney disease and has stage 5 kidney failure. He has been on the Kidney transplant waiting list for a year at ECMC and is on dialysis 3 days a week. He has less than 5% of his kidneys functioning. 
</p>
<p>  We are trying to raise money to help with medical and monthly bills and the expensive anti-rejection medicine he will have to take for the rest of his life if he gets the transplant. and to possibly assist a potential donor if they need help while out of work while recovering from the surgery.Tray is disabled from this disease and is unable to work, the bills are mounting and unfortunatly until a donor is found he will remain ill and unable to provide for his family. 
</p>
<p>  Tray has had problems with his kidneys since 2002 when he had surgery to remove a kidney stone but he wasnt diagnosed with polycystic kidneys until 3 years ago. In the last 3 years his health declined from stage 4 kidney failure to stage 5. In november 2012 he was listed as disabled and tried to work for a couple more months until he was too sick to continue. 
</p>
<p>  In june of 2013 Tray suffered from another kidney stone and it could not be operated on due to the condition of his kidneys this caused his kidneys to drop to 5% function. He almost died but had emergency surgerys for AV Fistula and Catheter in his chest for dialysis. He has had 7 surgerys since june related to dialysis and goes 3 days a week for treatment. 
</p>
<p>  Tray is suffering from symptoms like pain,extreme fatigue,nausa,insomnia, and the dialysis treatments are also really rough on him.His sickness makes it hard to even grocery shop and he can barely leave the house anymore. 
</p>
<p>  Tray is A+ and has had several people get tested to see if they could donate but unfortunatly they were denied. He has a couple people currently being tested but still -no match yet. He also wants to raise awarness to kidney disease and how important it is for people to donate organs.  please sign your donor card and consider being a living donor for a kidney there are many people waiting for kidneys - YOU CAN SAVE A LIFE. 
</p>
<p>  If you are interested in being a donor or you have questions call Shelley Moran - Transplant coordinator at ECMC Hospital   716-898-6283 
</p>
<p>  Tray is a great guy who wants to be healthy so he can enjoy life with his daughter and family and friends. Please help us give this young man a second chance at life . THANK YOU 
</p>
<p>   You can donate $1 or $1,000,00.  any amount is greatly appreaciated you can also help by sharing this post 
</p>
<p>  Please check out the donation perks !!!!!! 
</p>
<p> :::::: We are also trying to locate a kidney donor for a young local man who is O type blood, it doesnt matter if the O kidney he gets is positive or negative. actually any blood type is ok because it can be swapped for a closer match.
</p>
<p>  There is no cost to the donor to get tested or for the operation. it is covered under insurance. the donor is also covered for life against kidney problems- if there was a kidney issue (which is rare due to extensive screening) </p>
