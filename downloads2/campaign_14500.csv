It's all very low budget and basically home made. I work at an elementary school with grades 1 through 6 and in class I have been teaching the kids how to make comics and films and other creative things like that for several years, I also teach private art classes and run my own art camps every summer. Three years ago I made 'The Nandi Bear Tenants' It was a graphic novel about superheroes and talking cats and all sorts of exciting things. Since then it has become a favourite book of many young people (And old people), Especially at the school where I work. I have had constant requests for a sequel. So here it is. :)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499469229/jf0v3ff0xzmpwcmdamjm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Before I made The Nandi Bear Tenants, I got excited about all the old comics I made when I was a kid and decided to make a series of cartoons about one of the old superheroes I made up when I was a kid who was based on a real cat I had (We're talking 1985...) Anyway, I had such an amazing time bringing Dorriss Doom and her friends to life, that that was another reason I wanted to focus on making comics again for a while.

</h2>
<p>Thanks for being invested in this project! My name is<strong> Christopher Scott</strong>, also referred to as <strong>ScottyArtz</strong> or<strong> BoScotty</strong>. I am an amateur comic book illustrator, freelance artist, and designer. I graduated from the Illinois Institute of Art-Chicago in 2015 with a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in Illustration and Design.  Ray Fox is my first completely project. <strong>The first 2 Chapters are completed</strong> and free to read at RayFoxthecomic.com. I intend to get them ready for Ray Fox's <strong>first printed book!</strong><br/><br/>I actually came up with Ray Fox when I was 10 years old.  I was fascinated with action cartoons about anthropomorphic animals like the <strong>Mighty Ducks</strong>, <strong>Swat Kats</strong>, and the 2k3 <strong>Ninja Turtles</strong>. When I got older I got inspired by more serious/darker storytelling from the likes of Western comics like <strong>Spider-man</strong> and <strong>X men</strong> to Eastern comics like the long running <strong>One Piece</strong>, and the classic, original <strong>Dragon ball</strong>. To this day, I still believe that there's so much potential for a series like Swat Kats to have more thematic story telling like Spider-man. That’s what inspired me to make this story. <br/><br/>Ray Fox is a Action/Adventure story of comedic antics and drama. It is intended for young adults and up.  </p>

</div></div>","Enter: Raymond Fox, a clumsy and sarcastic, teenage fox in a world of anthropomorphic animals, who most seem to have special abilities and powers. Raymond, himself, is a stubborn vigilante of the capital municipality, Meva City.
Ray posses the ability to manipulate heat and plasma energy. Combined with his powers, he’s a skilled mixed martial artist, has unmatched agility, and he’s deceptively cunning. Unfortunately, his clumsiness and carefree attitude,  makes matters worse for him and others. He’s been a vigilante for only 3 months, and the entirety of Meva City hate his guts for his mishaps, labeling him a mischievous ARSONIST rather them calling him a hero.
His #1 motive is to prove himself worthy of his gifts and reconcile his mistakes. In the first 2 chapters,  Ray’s on a journey discovering himself and learning what it really means to be a sacrificial hero!

Hey Everybody!

Thanks for being invested in this project! My name is Christopher Scott, also referred to as ScottyArtz or BoScotty. I am an amateur comic book illustrator, freelance artist, and designer. I graduated from the Illinois Institute of Art-Chicago in 2015 with a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in Illustration and Design.  Ray Fox is my first completely project. The first 2 Chapters are completed and free to read at RayFoxthecomic.com. I intend to get them ready for Ray Fox's first printed book!I actually came up with Ray Fox when I was 10 years old.  I was fascinated with action cartoons about anthropomorphic animals like the Mighty Ducks, Swat Kats, and the 2k3 Ninja Turtles. When I got older I got inspired by more serious/darker storytelling from the likes of Western comics like Spider-man and X men to Eastern comics like the long running One Piece, and the classic, original Dragon ball. To this day, I still believe that there's so much potential for a series like Swat Kats to have more thematic story telling like Spider-man. That’s what inspired me to make this story. Ray Fox is a Action/Adventure story of comedic antics and drama. It is intended for young adults and up.  
 
$3500 is needed to produce the first 2 chapters of Ray Fox in Print and to ship them to Backers. The book will be a 140+ page black & white soft gloss cover graphic novel.

<p>Thank you for visiting and considering helping me relaunch my comedy career...I am Denny Anderson, and I have developed a Stand Up Comedy routine titled Denny Anderson's ""Reality Check World Tour"" Comedy Show, and am ready to take this act on the road for it's world tour. This act has been developed for the last 6 months, and I have performed this show at 5 different towns and cities here in Colorado. Now...time...yes...;) The world is about to experience THE very first actual Jedi Master working the Light Force with the use of laughter. As a Jedi...I cannot and will not lie, and this makes for some great laughs, and some eye openers too. A cross between George Carlin and Don Rickles, I place everyday lies on the table...Exposed for all to see...In the end my audience will see some light in this darkness that engulfs this planet these days. I have no borders as a Jedi...Tis why it is a world tour. So...Please help me shoot for the stars once again, and ride along with me! I never forget a friend...<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am out to set the world straight on issues like lieing to kids about Santa Clause the Sith. And The dreaded tooth faeiry get it as well. I am very colorful in my Jedi Performance Garb, and use big clown shoes in my performances. People leave my show feeling happy and reflective about what was told to them that night.

</div>
<p>It's your old pal Nick Bertozzi here. I've written and drawn a new 32-page issue of my Harvey Award-winning  comic series Rubber Necker. If you'd like to read a copy of the full-color Rubber Necker #6, help me print it up. </p>
<p>Did you miss Rubber Necker #5 last year? Don't worry, I have copies left. There's a reward level that includes #5 and #6.</p>

<p>I need $1,000.00 to print the full-color book and another $500 to ship it out to you.</p>

</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>

<h2><strong>About Top Secret Press</strong></h2>

We're hoping You guys can help us make this happen!<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612191442/cfuvgptkudufozkkjalq.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p>

<h2>Top Secret Press 10th Anniversary!</h2>
<p>Here we are ten years later! Most likely the majority of you have no idea about Top Secret Press as to who or what, we are, then again ~ you just might!  Anyway, I thought we'd give you a <strong>FREE PREVIEW</strong> of some of our comic titles in the form of a <strong>100 Page Giant Digital Edition</strong> with a great retro cover by TSP Artist <strong>Rafael Lanhellas</strong>!<br/><br/><strong>Download Link:  ???? ?? ?? ?????? ?????</strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612620873/mqzqixqukteexsrhkcme.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>Perks ~ we have PERKS!</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have picked a goal; Funding is Flexible!</li>
<li>Even if we don't reach the goal, we deliver the Perks!</li>
<li>All the Perks are In Stock ~ there will be very little waiting for delivery!</li>
<li>PDF's will be shipped when Indiegogo Funds Clear (as soon as 2 weeks after Funding ends)</li>
<li>Physical copies will be mailed 2-3 weeks after the end of Indiegogo Campaign.</li>

</ul>
</div><div>
<h2>How You can Help!</h2>
<p>We are expanding! Which means we need more space and resources to continue creating exciting new comics! The goal of this Indiegogo is to eliminate overstock &amp; to make room for new projects.  Overstock hurts because it is money sitting; always a problem with publishing comics!  Here's a chance for YOU to get a Great Perk from <strong>20% - 60% OFF</strong> our normal price!</p>

<h2>About Add Ons...</h2>
<p>There's quite a few. While this campaign is a little different from our last, there are almost as many Add Ons as Perks! <strong>Alternate Covers ~</strong> <strong>Signed Covers</strong> <strong>Special Limited Covers ~ These are all fairly limited at this point! <br/><br/>What is the different about the Add On's this time?</strong> I have split most of the Add On's between the Perk and Add On section's. So, if it appears Sold Out as a Perk, we may still have it as an Add On.  I thought it would be the best way to allow everyone a chance to get something great!<br/><br/> <u>If there is something we missed, or something you think we should add ~ email us and let us know</u>!</p>

</div></div>","About Top Secret Press
My name is John Daniel Taylor IV, owner of Top Secret Press. For over ten years, I have been creating, writing and selling comics with the help of the best talented Artists around. A fully established publishing house, Top Secret Press publishes comics by talented creators & writers, as well as our own line of Comics, Playing Cards, Prints, Magazines & Graphic Novels.
Top Secret Press has a number of great comics planned in the future! With the success of this Indiegogo Project, we hope to be able to move forward on a great number of these projects while giving our stockroom a little space! We're hoping You guys can help us make this happen! 

Top Secret Press 10th Anniversary!
Here we are ten years later! Most likely the majority of you have no idea about Top Secret Press as to who or what, we are, then again ~ you just might!  Anyway, I thought we'd give you a FREE PREVIEW of some of our comic titles in the form of a 100 Page Giant Digital Edition with a great retro cover by TSP Artist Rafael Lanhellas!Download Link:  ???? ?? ?? ?????? ?????

Perks ~ we have PERKS!

We have picked a goal; Funding is Flexible!
Even if we don't reach the goal, we deliver the Perks!
All the Perks are In Stock ~ there will be very little waiting for delivery!
PDF's will be shipped when Indiegogo Funds Clear (as soon as 2 weeks after Funding ends)
Physical copies will be mailed 2-3 weeks after the end of Indiegogo Campaign.
The wait time for products is short and sweet!


How You can Help!
We are expanding! Which means we need more space and resources to continue creating exciting new comics! The goal of this Indiegogo is to eliminate overstock & to make room for new projects.  Overstock hurts because it is money sitting; always a problem with publishing comics!  Here's a chance for YOU to get a Great Perk from 20% - 60% OFF our normal price!


About Add Ons...
There's quite a few. While this campaign is a little different from our last, there are almost as many Add Ons as Perks! Alternate Covers ~ Signed Covers Special Limited Covers ~ These are all fairly limited at this point! What is the different about the Add On's this time? I have split most of the Add On's between the Perk and Add On section's. So, if it appears Sold Out as a Perk, we may still have it as an Add On.  I thought it would be the best way to allow everyone a chance to get something great! If there is something we missed, or something you think we should add ~ email us and let us know!

Risks & Challenges
Top Secret Press has delivered every one of their over 40+ crowd-funded projects! Including Playing Cards, Sketch Books, Comics, Buttons, Postcards, Magazines, Artwork and more. Every day we reach out to new fans all over the world!

The only challenge is deciding which Perk to pledge! All items listed are ready to sell, they just need to be packed and mailed. We have a proven track record of sales for over seven years, so you can go for it, and know you WILL get your items!
It's all up to you guys now ~ Thanks!John Daniel Taylor IVEditor in Chief / OwnerTop Secret PressWEB SITE: www.topsecretpress.comFACEBOOK: www.facebook.com/topsecretpressTWITTER: https://twitter.com/TSPCMX INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/tspcmxTUMBLR: http://topsecretpress.tumblr.com                                                    Keep scrolling ~ There's MORE!

</div></div>","THE BOOKSlaves for Gods is a comic book series heavily influenced by science fiction movies of the eighties. Steeped in conspiracy theory, and told through parallel story lines, it follows two computer programers and an anarchist group, all fighting to bring down a corrupt corporation lead by a maniacal CEO Gasoline Face. 
WHO WE ARE




These Machines Are Winning is a constantly evolving art collective of musicians, writers, comic artists, editors, producers, filmmakers, engineers, and actors. By utilizing multiple mediums, we are able to create a fully immersive experience into the world of Slaves For Gods. 

WHERE WE ARE NOW









We are extremely fortunate to be working with interior artist Aaron Minier (DC Wildstorm’s Push, Black Rose), colorist/letterer Jodi Wynn (Lazarus), as well as cover artists JOCK (Wytches, The Losers), Charlie Adlard (The Walking Dead), James O'Barr (The Crow), Antoine Dodé (The Crow: Curare), and Dustin D'Arnault (Outlaw Territories Vol. 3). We also have numerous splash pages with ""quotes"" by some of our biggest influences: John Carpenter (Escape From New York, The Live), Travis Walton (Fire in the Sky), ''Apollo 14''  Astronaut  Ed Mitchell, and ''Canadian Prime Minister of Defense''  Paul Hellyer (All who we made personal connections with). We have self-funded, and completed 3 albums, (all of which are available through this campaign), six cinematic music videos, and the first two books of the comic series (Excluding color and letters). Your contributions will get our artists back to work, and help us get the finished product to publishers. 



WHAT YOU CAN GET

We are doing something different with our perks for this campaign. Because our goal for Slaves For Gods is publication through a major distribution company, we do not want to offer the finished product through one of the tiers, not knowing how long the process will take. Instead, our tiers consist of pre-orders for two new albums and merchandise exclusive to this campaign, including t-shirts, hoodies, and original artwork. What is exciting about our merchandise is that every piece has original artwork from comic artists such as JOCK, James O'Barr, Toshio Maeda, Antoine Dodé, and Aaron Minier (All artwork will appear in Slaves for Gods).

The indigenous Elves, warriors and magicians of the highest caliber are busy exterminating the fledgling society of humans. Cities are ravaged, and entire kingdoms are eradicated overnight. The Humans of this world band together under a great king, Thalion, to turn the tides of war in the favor of humankind. Isaac is just another warrior, with a loving family left behind in a peaceful town - far from the front lines. Isaac is destined to either live or die by his sword until the Gods chose another path for him.</p><br/><p>One fateful night Isaac fell into Death's embrace, mortally wounded, before the Gods revoked his right to die. Fearing for the survival of their human followers, the Gods anoint him their champion, the Immortal Phoenix. Now fighting not only for his Kingdom, but as the hand of his Gods, the Phoenix wages war against the mightiest of Elves, Vakarian, whose knowledge of the Arcane makes him the only person on the continent with the potential skillset to bring the Phoenix to an end.</p><br/><p>Led by the Crown-Princess and General of the armed forces Arya, the Elves seek to reclaim the continent which they have lost to the humans. The inevitable showdown will have world-altering, cataclysmic consequences.</p><br/><br/><p>----</p><br/><p>Our project, Phoenix Origins, aims to become a full-color, monthly comic series distributed digitally. It's high fantasy to the core, in a completely unique and original world. The complexity and depth of the world itself, and the people who live there make the entire story feel organic, and tangible.</p><br/><p>Phoenix Origins is a classic hero's tale - but with a giant twist. We explore the darker side of being a hero, when the choices our hero is faced with range from bad to worse. What happens after your destiny-bound immortal hero accomplishes what it is he is set out to do. What questionable choices must a good character make for the greater good, and at what cost?</p><br/><p>This project is the first installment in the overarching, multimedia universe that we call the Phoenix Project, with further chapters of this world’s chronology already being penned by our creative team.</p><br/><p>The universe that the Phoenix inhabits lives and breathes on its own. The true magic of this world is that it is open to interpretation. This story arc, the origins of Isaac, the first immortal Phoenix, is only glimpse of our world. Isaac’s tale will introduce many other characters in his travels, some friendly, most dangerous, all self-motivated.</p><br/><p>A hero is only as interesting as the obstacles he must overcome, and Vakarian is Isaac’s nemesis. Vakarian’s history is a darker tale that speaks of his repeated attempts at redemption, and the cruel hand that fate can deal to one person. Constantly bludgeoned by the cataclysmic world events, forces of nature beyond his control, and also his own choices, Vakarian is not necessarily an antagonist, rather another tortured character on the other side of the global battle - one who some of our friends have related to more than Isaac!</p><br/><p>Our world operates in shades of gray. It's up to you to decide which side is right and just when all of the cards are on the table.</p><br/><br/><p><b>BEHIND THE STORY</b></p><br/><br/><p>The roots of the Phoenix Origins go back over a decade, when our lead writer, Keith R. Sokol, was first introduced to J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, and to George R.R. Martin’s Tales of Ice and Fire. Since having his eyes opened to those touchstone, densely woven tales of destruction, warfare, and salvation, Keith has long been writing short stories and novellas set in his own fantasy worlds. The more he wrote, the more the tales became connected through the geography, populations, and arcane religions, and the universe where our tale takes place was forged.</p><br/><p>The Phoenix, as a character, began to develop and mature as Keith was introduced to ancient mythology, and as he further studied world religions. With roots in Old and New Testament gravitas and the colorful history of Greek and Roman mythology, our protagonist the Phoenix - as a hero of legend - was born.</p><br/><p>Keith met Sean Torney in April, 2013 at an event for the local video game retailer that Keith was working for. They instantly bonded over a mutual interest in games, movies, books, and Sean’s beautiful dog Kali (who is a huge Firefly fan, and is the team’s nerdy muse).</p><br/><p><img alt=""20140122_164924.jpg"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/14yWADE4hi6thqYH_tCtZ9f5-HGKMKI1VoSa_uGsAUX4GAkV1OLZ0Mx-C1NM55qS25ta60XF7GWpkclkfrMeBkzSLmJ6HKf6n8FiTKAm5m5YRu1LGx7xZKZWWpU3lOrAeg"" src="""" style=""""/>. </p><br/><p>Sean Torney is a leader at heart. It's something Sean further developed while serving in the U.S. Air Force. It turned out that Sean and Keith were attending the same college, and Sean asked Keith to write reviews for upcoming games on his newly launched website, Tornstar Plays (which draws its name from Sean’s gamer tag on XBox Live). Keith was introduced to Alexander Ally as part of that project. Keith brought them up to speed on the mostly-written manuscript of his Phoenix novel that he’d been working on for about three years, and both Sean and Alex fell in love with the universe of the Phoenix.</p><br/><p>Sean and Alex collaborated with Keith to create new characters and expand existing ones, and together, they scripted events in the world Keith had created. We originally set out to create a video game (more on that later!), and ultimately decided to introduce this world to our audience in comic book form - before giving them the opportunity to interact with it!</p><br/><p>While it's true that he is the creator and writer of Phoenix Origins, nobody has ever accused Keith of being a good artist. Stick figures are pretty much the limit of his artistic talent.</p><br/><p>Exploring how to bring this project to life, Sean brought in his life-long friend Jason Allen, an Emmy Award winning cinematographer and producer, who has previous marketing experience directing and producing crowd-funded projects. Jason put us in touch with experienced independent comic producers <a href=""http://powerplaycomic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kurt Christensen</a> and <a href=""http://reillybrown.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reilly Brown</a> (<a href=""https://www.comixology.com/Power-Play/comics-series/6787"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Power Play</a>), <a href=""http://www.vitodelsante.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vito Delsante</a> (<a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/incogvito/stray-a-new-superhero-comic"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.vitodelsante.com/stray/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stray</a>), and <a href=""http://whatisfile13.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dan Hosek</a> (<a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2080276988/file-13-0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">File 13</a>) to help build our project’s game plan, and now we’re ready to take things to the next step.</p><br/><p>The crew formed a company, Tornstar Development LTD. Alex is the business mind behind the effort - determining operating and production costs, taking meetings with potential collaborators, handling legal paperwork, setting and tracking deadlines to ensure that this project (and others in the works) get made quickly, and efficiently!</p><br/><p>Keith, Sean, and Alex ventured to New York Comic Con Special Edition earlier this summer where we met Scott Ambruson after interviewing numerous artists.  Scott was a perfect match for the project, and joined the Tornstar Development team as our lead illustrator. He is a regular fixture on the East Coast Artist Alley circuit, specializing in fan art, pinups, and cover art.  His pinup work is most notably unique for his “two worlds collide” style - badass, yet classically beautiful female warriors. Scott’s professional work includes being the Co-creator of the characters Detectives Damion Chase and Kristen Hunt of Chase and Hunt prominently featured in the CRIME WAVE ANTHOLOGY comic book (published by 3JProductions).  He has done work on the comic book TRAILER PARK of TERROR, by Imperium comics.  Scott is currently doing covers for titles including the comic books AXTECA, (published by Red Stylo Media), and DESTINY QUEEN of THIEVES (published by Scare Tactix Graphix).</p><br/><p>The entire physical world of the Phoenix is fully mapped out. Additionally, we have already written multiple comic book story arcs, scripts for an RPG video game, and script outlines for potential web series, short films, and we’re working on a feature length story as well! This universe can extend far into the future with the amount of content we have created already... Phoenix Origins is only the first step into that larger world!</p><br/><p>We’re very excited to share our universe with you. Enjoy the book, and thank you in advance for all of your help promoting and funding Phoenix Origins!</p><br/><br/><br/><p><b>RISKS/CHALLENGES</b></p><br/><p>The inherent challenge in funding a creator owned comic as a first time comic producer is a lack of publicity/exposure. We have worked extremely hard to build relationships with established artists who want to support us on their social media in advance of this campaign, but you can help us further! Please share this with your friends and family and post links to our IndieGoGo campaign on your social media - it could be that little bit extra exposure from YOU that helps fund this project!</p><br/><p>Our next hurdle has been that creating a comic from scratch has a huge learning curve. That said, so far we are finding our way through that labyrinth with the help of our advisors, and doing our best to anticipate and budget for all production costs.</p><br/><p>Finally, our team has a lot of outside-of-comics responsibilities at this point. Between family obligations, school, and our paying jobs, we are all budgeting significant time out of our week - every week - to bring this project to fruition, and we will continue to do everything we can to see it become a success. So far this hasn’t presented a conflict for us as we’ve written and edited the Phoenix Origins series, and we don’t foresee it being an issue as we move into pencil, ink, color, letters, and publishing.</p><br/><p>The ultimate goal for the Tornstar Development team is that Keith, Sean, and Alex would like to produce digitally distributed, independent comics on a full-time basis. This project is our first step towards that goal! Ideally we would like for our first issue of Phoenix Origins to be so successful that our team will see a modest profit after the production costs are paid, and also that by distributing and selling our completed first issue, we’ll get the momentum to sustain the whole series through direct sales without further crowdfunding campaigns!</p><br/><p>All funds raised by this IndieGogo will go directly towards the completion, publication, promotion, and delivery of our comic, Phoenix Origins.  We have worked out our costs to:</p><p>-$180 per page for artwork (pencil, ink, color, and letters)</p><p>-$2900 for printing/shipping (comic books as well as concept art prints)</p><br/><p><b>REACH GOALS</b></p><br/><p>All funds above the $6500 goal will help us add content to the first book, but the more you contribute to Phoenix Origins, the more you get!</p><p>-If we reach $9500, we’ll add an additional 12 pages to Issue #1. **</p><p>-If we reach $10,500, we’ll add in the first 5 pages of Issue #2 on top of that. **</p><p>-If we reach $14,500, we’ll be able to bring you Issue #2! **</p><br/><p>** Included for all reward levels that include Issue #1!)</p><br/><p>As we approach our funding goals, more stretch goals and rewards will be added. We may add in art-work, extend certain story arcs, or create solo books for our characters - detailing their lives before the events of the story! </p><br/>Even if you can’t contribute money to the project, it’d be tremendously helpful if you share this with friends and fellow comic enthusiasts who might be interested! Thank you in advance for all of your support.<br/></div>","We first would like to thank you, our audience and investors, for taking the time to check out our project.

The complexity and depth of the world itself, and the people who live there make the entire story feel organic, and tangible.Phoenix Origins is a classic hero's tale - but with a giant twist. We explore the darker side of being a hero, when the choices our hero is faced with range from bad to worse. What happens after your destiny-bound immortal hero accomplishes what it is he is set out to do. What questionable choices must a good character make for the greater good, and at what cost?This project is the first installment in the overarching, multimedia universe that we call the Phoenix Project, with further chapters of this world’s chronology already being penned by our creative team.The universe that the Phoenix inhabits lives and breathes on its own. The true magic of this world is that it is open to interpretation. This story arc, the origins of Isaac, the first immortal Phoenix, is only glimpse of our world. Isaac’s tale will introduce many other characters in his travels, some friendly, most dangerous, all self-motivated.A hero is only as interesting as the obstacles he must overcome, and Vakarian is Isaac’s nemesis. Vakarian’s history is a darker tale that speaks of his repeated attempts at redemption, and the cruel hand that fate can deal to one person. Constantly bludgeoned by the cataclysmic world events, forces of nature beyond his control, and also his own choices, Vakarian is not necessarily an antagonist, rather another tortured character on the other side of the global battle - one who some of our friends have related to more than Isaac!Our world operates in shades of gray. It's up to you to decide which side is right and just when all of the cards are on the table.BEHIND THE STORYThe roots of the Phoenix Origins go back over a decade, when our lead writer, Keith R. Sokol, was first introduced to J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, and to George R.R. Martin’s Tales of Ice and Fire. Since having his eyes opened to those touchstone, densely woven tales of destruction, warfare, and salvation, Keith has long been writing short stories and novellas set in his own fantasy worlds. The more he wrote, the more the tales became connected through the geography, populations, and arcane religions, and the universe where our tale takes place was forged.The Phoenix, as a character, began to develop and mature as Keith was introduced to ancient mythology, and as he further studied world religions. With roots in Old and New Testament gravitas and the colorful history of Greek and Roman mythology, our protagonist the Phoenix - as a hero of legend - was born.Keith met Sean Torney in April, 2013 at an event for the local video game retailer that Keith was working for. They instantly bonded over a mutual interest in games, movies, books, and Sean’s beautiful dog Kali (who is a huge Firefly fan, and is the team’s nerdy muse).. Sean Torney is a leader at heart. It's something Sean further developed while serving in the U.S. Air Force. It turned out that Sean and Keith were attending the same college, and Sean asked Keith to write reviews for upcoming games on his newly launched website, Tornstar Plays (which draws its name from Sean’s gamer tag on XBox Live). Keith was introduced to Alexander Ally as part of that project. Keith brought them up to speed on the mostly-written manuscript of his Phoenix novel that he’d been working on for about three years, and both Sean and Alex fell in love with the universe of the Phoenix.Sean and Alex collaborated with Keith to create new characters and expand existing ones, and together, they scripted events in the world Keith had created. We originally set out to create a video game (more on that later!), and ultimately decided to introduce this world to our audience in comic book form - before giving them the opportunity to interact with it!While it's true that he is the creator and writer of Phoenix Origins, nobody has ever accused Keith of being a good artist. Stick figures are pretty much the limit of his artistic talent.Exploring how to bring this project to life, Sean brought in his life-long friend Jason Allen, an Emmy Award winning cinematographer and producer, who has previous marketing experience directing and producing crowd-funded projects. Jason put us in touch with experienced independent comic producers Kurt Christensen and Reilly Brown (Power Play), Vito Delsante (Stray), and Dan Hosek (File 13) to help build our project’s game plan, and now we’re ready to take things to the next step.The crew formed a company, Tornstar Development LTD. Alex is the business mind behind the effort - determining operating and production costs, taking meetings with potential collaborators, handling legal paperwork, setting and tracking deadlines to ensure that this project (and others in the works) get made quickly, and efficiently!Keith, Sean, and Alex ventured to New York Comic Con Special Edition earlier this summer where we met Scott Ambruson after interviewing numerous artists.  Scott was a perfect match for the project, and joined the Tornstar Development team as our lead illustrator. He is a regular fixture on the East Coast Artist Alley circuit, specializing in fan art, pinups, and cover art.  His pinup work is most notably unique for his “two worlds collide” style - badass, yet classically beautiful female warriors. Scott’s professional work includes being the Co-creator of the characters Detectives Damion Chase and Kristen Hunt of Chase and Hunt prominently featured in the CRIME WAVE ANTHOLOGY comic book (published by 3JProductions).  He has done work on the comic book TRAILER PARK of TERROR, by Imperium comics.  Scott is currently doing covers for titles including the comic books AXTECA, (published by Red Stylo Media), and DESTINY QUEEN of THIEVES (published by Scare Tactix Graphix).The entire physical world of the Phoenix is fully mapped out. Additionally, we have already written multiple comic book story arcs, scripts for an RPG video game, and script outlines for potential web series, short films, and we’re working on a feature length story as well! This universe can extend far into the future with the amount of content we have created already... Phoenix Origins is only the first step into that larger world!We’re very excited to share our universe with you. Enjoy the book, and thank you in advance for all of your help promoting and funding Phoenix Origins!RISKS/CHALLENGESThe inherent challenge in funding a creator owned comic as a first time comic producer is a lack of publicity/exposure. We have worked extremely hard to build relationships with established artists who want to support us on their social media in advance of this campaign, but you can help us further! Please share this with your friends and family and post links to our IndieGoGo campaign on your social media - it could be that little bit extra exposure from YOU that helps fund this project!Our next hurdle has been that creating a comic from scratch has a huge learning curve. That said, so far we are finding our way through that labyrinth with the help of our advisors, and doing our best to anticipate and budget for all production costs.Finally, our team has a lot of outside-of-comics responsibilities at this point. Between family obligations, school, and our paying jobs, we are all budgeting significant time out of our week - every week - to bring this project to fruition, and we will continue to do everything we can to see it become a success. So far this hasn’t presented a conflict for us as we’ve written and edited the Phoenix Origins series, and we don’t foresee it being an issue as we move into pencil, ink, color, letters, and publishing.The ultimate goal for the Tornstar Development team is that Keith, Sean, and Alex would like to produce digitally distributed, independent comics on a full-time basis. This project is our first step towards that goal! Ideally we would like for our first issue of Phoenix Origins to be so successful that our team will see a modest profit after the production costs are paid, and also that by distributing and selling our completed first issue, we’ll get the momentum to sustain the whole series through direct sales without further crowdfunding campaigns!All funds raised by this IndieGogo will go directly towards the completion, publication, promotion, and delivery of our comic, Phoenix Origins.  We have worked out our costs to:-$180 per page for artwork (pencil, ink, color, and letters)-$2900 for printing/shipping (comic books as well as concept art prints)REACH GOALSAll funds above the $6500 goal will help us add content to the first book, but the more you contribute to Phoenix Origins, the more you get!-If we reach $9500, we’ll add an additional 12 pages to Issue #1. **-If we reach $10,500, we’ll add in the first 5 pages of Issue #2 on top of that. **-If we reach $14,500, we’ll be able to bring you Issue #2! **** Included for all reward levels that include Issue #1!)As we approach our funding goals, more stretch goals and rewards will be added. We may add in art-work, extend certain story arcs, or create solo books for our characters - detailing their lives before the events of the story! Even if you can’t contribute money to the project, it’d be tremendously helpful if you share this with friends and fellow comic enthusiasts who might be interested! Thank you in advance for all of your support.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","Knight Seeker Vol. 3 Blades of Justice 
My name is Eric Cooper and I’m the creator and author of the Knight Seeker novels. I’ve decided to share with you the passion behind my work and the handful of artists, writers, and actors that have come together to present Knight Seeker to the world. This Indiegogo page was created to help fund the costs of the artwork and editing of the 3rd novel called Blades of Justice.

Novel # 3 Blades of Justice is the third installment that you kind people are financial backing which takes place in Philadelphia, the city of Brotherly Love. A vicious axe-wielding vigilante known as Guillotine is wreaking mayhem upon the city. Guillotine takes it upon himself to dispense the ultimate punishment to corrupt individuals who break the law.
            Knight Seeker along with the local authorities try to keep the ever growing body count from escalating as a secret agency of the United States Government adds another element of complexity to the intense situation.
Knight Seeker Vol. 1

Novel# 1 is truly the foundation and the beginning of Knight Seeker, which is based in the real world; present day and present time that dives into the story of our hero. Nygel Spinner is a college kid who comes across an extraterrestrial event that almost ended his life, but through the chaotic episode he survived and was forcefully given alien devices and superhero human abilities to become the ultimate hunter. As Nygel starts to discover his newly found powers evil is at work as an ancient demon sorcerer named Warlord Sage is resurrected in our time and uses his mystical dark powers to establish himself as the drug lord of New York City in attempts to take over the drug territories on the East Coast. With the help of his mutant henchman Tygron, Sage is closer in achieving his goal, and destined to open the gates of hell to destroy all of mankind. (There are 316 page and 50 illustrations)
Knight Seeker Vol. 2

Novel #2 Crimes of Passion begins at the Vatican when it was first being constructed, and an artifact is stored in a vault to be locked away from the world. That is until present day when the artifact is removed from the Vatican vault and is placed on display for a charity event in New York City.
            The City of New York is placed on lock down as two powerful mutants run rampant through the Big Apple. One of the mutants is named Graviton an exiled Roman Catholic Priest who is trying to reconnect to his old life after escaping from a hibernation facility. The other mutant that is tied into this action adventure is Sting, a jewelry thief who takes on the task to steal the coveted artifact. Knight Seeker is trapped in the middle of the conflict as the N.Y.P.D, U.S. Marshals, and a high tech task group tries to maintain order in the city. (There are 435 pages and 39 illustrations)

<h3>Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign for my upcoming comic book series, MGD: Vampire Hunter. This fundraiser will focus on raising funds for issue number one in a five part series. I've already written the script and had it copyrighted, had a promotional image created by the insanely talented Matthew Bowers, and have several publishing ideas in mind. Literally the only thing your donations will go towards is hiring an artist to create issue number one.</h3>
<p>I have my degree in media &amp; film and recently I've been steering away from the film side and sticking with media and journalism. This is how and why I've decided to take a stab at the comic book world. During this whole quest I've been helped by the fabulous Lia Scott Price - the author and creator of her own comic book series, Vampire Guardian Angels. If you know her, and love her as I do, then this is just another good reason to help me make MGD: Vampire Hunter a reality; as Lia will be appearing in the comic book as the lead antagonist.</p>
<p>MGD: Vampire Hunter can best be described from a synopsis in a previous press release: ""Welcome to the New Jersey Shore, specifically New Point Lake; a quiet little town sandwiched between two of the State’s biggest party spots. Now that the top rated reality show has pulled out of the area, the citizens of Exit 98 had hoped that their lives could return to normal. They were wrong…</p>
<p>Lured by the promise of young, drunk muscle heads and hot, dumb sunbathers, it seems that vampires have set up shop in New Point Lake and are feasting on the locals. Fronted by their leader, a nefarious red head who is way up in the vampire hierarchy, the vampires plan to make the town a breeding ground for their undead army. When the B.E.N.N.Y.S. return for the summer, it will be an all you can eat buffet.</p>
<p>Enter MGD, the State’s – and maybe the country’s – only chance for survival. Mike GD was just your average vampire television fanatic until the last great New Jersey slayer passed the torch on to him. Now he has dedicated his life (sort of…) to stopping the vampires in his city before they grow in numbers and expand their reach. Your typical hard bodied but kind bail bonds assistant by day is MGD: Vampire Hunter by night.""</p>
<p>By donating to my comic book campaign you can win yourself some exciting perks including an autographed advanced copy, your name in the ending pages - further cementing your place as a vampire hunter supporter, and even being written into the pages as a cameo or a guest spot in multiple panels with dialogue.</p>
<p>To end things, I really just want to thank you all for support. Whether you read this page, share this page, or actually donate your money to my project, I really do appreciate all your support. This dream could not become a reality without you.</p>

<p>Amid a time of trouble, a family is in crisis. A King who has lost the favor of his Deity and of his people, a son seeking his father’s approval, a daughter longing for a purpose beyond being a pampered princess, and a Queen struggling behind the scenes to keep the Kingdom together.  </p>

 Hey there internet world! My name is Ted Cronie, aka CATNIP and I've been working on my first ever graphic novel, Phenomenopolis~!Indie GoGo says I should introduce myself, check, tell you about my background...Well I'm an artist who grew up in Powell River, BC,  and ever since I can remember, I've been drawing! Always doodling, painting, and in my teenagehood, took up doing murals with spraypaint! Its been one helluva creative life, and I'm always on the go with multiple projects at once.One medium  that has stayed near and dear to my heart are comics! The way they lead the eye, captivate the story and express on many different layered levels just makes me feel at home... Especially when I'm makin em!So yes... my dream campaign... I originally made a Phenomenopolis oneshot in 2009 which was when I decided to create a world for my doodles. This oneshot was 30 pages long and depicted a kid named Andrew Dreamer discovering bits and pieces of his hometown ontop of a floating island!Since then the story and world has elaborated itself through my paintings and short comics, and finally in 2014 I self published the first chapter issue of Phenomenopolis with a puny run of 60 issues, which sold out fast! :)Here's a couple pages from the first chapter, entitled ""As Above, So Below""You can read the whole chapter on my facebook page here,Chapter One: As above, So belowThe second chapter is comin' along swimmingly, but I'd love some support along the way to ensure it  a successful release!The final book will contain 5 chapters, as one cohesive story with a few of my minicomics thrown in to demonstrate background and character development! It will be filled with alot of fun adventures and even funner (more fun) illustration!So now that I've explained the project, I'll explain myself!I currently live on a bus on farmland here in Powell River. Its beautiful and amazing, however, being an artist has its perks and its hardships! I make some money from an artshop I help run called Kaleidoscope here in town, where I display my paintings, comics, prints and whatever else I decide to create :)As you may have guessed, I'm entirely dedicated to my life of artistry.. Painting on walls, painting with friends, painting around the world  is my dreams come true!Storytelling is the main function of my art,And the community of creative minds I belong to is the driving force of my creations!The funding I recieve from this campaign will go towards the entire printing process of all the chapters as each issue is completed, and the printing and distribution of the final book! Along the way, everyone who donates will recieve copies of each issue, with stickers, t-shirts, prints and many more goodies that will take us all on a Phenomenal adventure through the world of Phenomenopolis!So far, the dream is already manifesting as a reality, and in the not too distant future, all will become real and open doors of imagination for us all!Thank you for your support, anything helps, and everything helps to get this book published and to your lovely hands :)Even if this IndieGoGo campaign is somehow proven defunkt, the book will be published and released in timely fashion.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hi, I'm Kevin Smith. As a reader (and lover) of comics for over 30 years, I have decided to begin writing and publishing one of my own! I have multiple issues scripted and have commissioned the artwork for the first one-shot issue, but I need the $$ to pay for the art and to get it published--which also helps me get a product out there that major comics studios can see/read and decide if this is something that they would like to purchase for themselves! The story starts in Victorian London and winds up as the  adventure of two adults and two teens (along with their iron robot) as they bounce through parallel worlds on a myriad of adventures. In this one-shot story that I am trying to get published, the story takes place about a year after the group has formed. In only 16 pages, they travel to a world where Science &amp; Inventions are mainstream and competed over, a dark, gritty 40's style noir detective world, and a world ruled by sky pirates and their automaton crewmates!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking for a total of $2500 to cover the costs of art,publishing, trademarks, copyrights, etc. To start , I am hoping for minimum support of $25 per person (but more is always welcome!). Support of $25 will get you an autographed copy of the book and a printed ""thank you"" in a future issue. I am thinking that support of $100 will get you the autographed book, your name on the thank you list in a future issue and either a full-body drawing of you (or maybe your child?) in full Steampunk period gear OR (if the comic gets picked up) maybe a guest appearance as a character in the book! Good? Evil? Robot? Human? Alien? The possibilities of how you could make your comic book debut are endless!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Speaking of endless possibilities, consider this: a concept like this does NOT have to be limited to comic book form. Mediums such as animated series, video games and movies are certainly options! Once a major company picks up original concept, they have the contacts and $$ to expand these ideas in all KINDS of ways!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to help out financially, I would greatly appreciate it if you could pass this on to those who may be interested. Surely you know SOMEONE who reads comics, has kids who reads comics, goes to the movies, etc. Any help you can give would be GREATLY appreciated!</p>

We have William Shatner to thank for bringing us together! He instinctively knew that our combined talents would be the formula needed to create the concept of the LNL Cinematic Graphic Novel.


LNL Partners is a new creative company specializing in digital comic books and graphic novels. Our team consists of Emmy Award-winning Disney and Marvel talent with expertise in animation, music and audio, as well as world-renowned work in comic-book writing and art. We have offices in both Hollywood and New York.



LNL Partners has licensed William Shatner's sci-fi novel MAN O' WAR, and is adapting it to our new format: The Cinematic Graphic Novel. This entertainment product is designed to be viewed on all digital platforms.






OUR GOAL

Our goal is to apply advanced technologies to the art of storytelling. The MAN O' WAR Cinematic Graphic Novel is viewed like a film, yet it is also a reading experience -- creating a unique entertainment piece that blends the best of both worlds!



Fans will be able to view our digital product on their smartphones, tablets and other digital devices. The story is scored with original music and sound effects, and the text can be converted into different languages to be read around the globe.




OUR PARTNER PANELFLY
The Cinematic Graphic Novel experience is enhanced by our Digital Distribution Partner, Panelfly. By using Panelfly's  digital platform, MAN O' WAR will be released as a Cinematic Graphic Novel as well as a Digital Comic and an eBook. The entire bundled package will be digitally interconnected and layered with Bonus Content and features in an App. This will also be a revolutionary industry first!






WHERE THE MONEY GOES



We already have skin in the game! So far, the team of writers, artists and editors have contributed their talent, time and labor to create all artwork, animation, music and audio with internal funding. 

For our 2015 launch we are seeking funding for creative process and digital distribution:








THE RISKS

Any new business venture has a high risk potential. We have done our level best to mitigate this with the following: 

1) Licensed a great story from a world-renowned icon: William Shatner! Mr. Shatner is extremely excited and believes in what we are creating.

2) Our team consists of world-class talent. 
3) We are working with a cutting-edge global marketing and digital-distribution company. 
For all these reasons and more, we are confident that we have all the ingredients for success. We just need one more thing...and that's YOU!




JOIN OUR MAN O' WAR TEAM!



We need your support, funding, feedback and participation in order to make this a success. 

Please review our selection of Perks; all material will be delivered between August and October 2015 -- that's our guarantee!

After efforts to replenish the earth became redundant in the early 6000’s, the world united and brought forth a mission to save an endangered human race.
Holding a selected one third of earth’s population, colonist ships were sent to seek out inhabitable planets within the Epsilon Eridani, Gliese and Alpha Centauri star systems.
This mission although successfully launched, brought tribulations to a civilization left behind on a dying planet.

The abandoned became bitter and with an unsure future the social order was crumbling.
This weak and disheartened society was easily manipulated and with political promises of obtaining earth’s last small sections of resourceful environments, new dictatorships across the world were formed.
These frivolous promises forged the Terra firma wars, earth’s longest running world war to date.
The Terra firma wars spanned over a millennia, leaving the world virtually uninhabitable.

The destruction was devastating, there was nothing left to fight for.

Although the terra firma wars were abandoned, conflicts between nations still remain.
Without a sanctioned trade agreement these nations are left to fight for their existence without assistance from outside governments.
This road for the human race has been long. Disease, poverty and famine run rampant with little help from their questionable governments.
But even in the darkest times of humanity there have always been glimpses of hope. However small, this hope can be just enough to unite the people towards a better future.

<p>Let's start with what The Jacket isn't. It isn't...okay let's start with what it is. It is a superhero, noir-ish, science fiction, mystery, thriller, epic 9-issue comic/graphic novel that details the exploits of a young man named Colton Emerson. Colton comes across an everyday looking jacket that grants him super-human abilities. He crosses paths with a bunch of colorful characters like the femme fatale, Penny Roux, a domestic terroist named Warren Harker, a shifty government agent, and even a tyrannical President. It is set in a near-future United States where everything we know now has been changed and oppressed. When Colton finds the jacket, it sets off a chain of events unlike anything he has ever experienced before. This campaign is set to explain the second chapter of his, and everyone else's stories.</p>

<p><img alt=""A Little About Us"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20660534/IndieGoGo/aboutus.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This story was created by Jason Biamonte (writer) and Randy Haldeman (artist). These are two guys fresh out of college trying to make it in the world of independent comics. They've got stories to tell, and are a looking for an audience to tell them to. We're based out of Strasburg, PA, a small town full of Amish and tourists. We are running a campaign to help support our comic that we've been writing and developing for the last three years. All of the story has been completely outlined and we are now looking to finish and print ALL of the issues. Chapter 1 has already been put into print thanks to all of the wonderful support of Indie GoGo a year ago. We've come back to ask for more support to assist printing of Chapter 2.</p>
<p>After we print Chapter 2 we will be headed to Baltimore Comic-Con (again) in September to release the comic. We've created a slew of great and very plentiful perks for our campaign. They are detailed a bit more below. With your support we will be able to print this book, and start on Chapter 3. After we release Chapter 2 (now that we're out of college) all of the other chapters of The Jacket will follow within months of one another leading up to an exciting finale in Chapter 9. Help us get there by supporting our first printing of Chapter 2!</p>

<p><img alt=""Why Do We Need The Money?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/20660534/IndieGoGo/needmoney.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We need $500 to cover printing costs for The Jacket: Chapter 2. Otherwise it will be out-of-pocket for a couple of college graduates with lots of debt to pay back. All of the money will go towards printing Chapter 2, acquiring an ISBN for the book, and getting perks out of the door. We have no other sources of income on this project, so whatever we make here will be the only money that we have to spend on the project. So as you can see, your contributions are EXTREMELY helpful.</p>

</div></div>","Let's start with what The Jacket isn't. It isn't...okay let's start with what it is. It is a superhero, noir-ish, science fiction, mystery, thriller, epic 9-issue comic/graphic novel that details the exploits of a young man named Colton Emerson. Colton comes across an everyday looking jacket that grants him super-human abilities. He crosses paths with a bunch of colorful characters like the femme fatale, Penny Roux, a domestic terroist named Warren Harker, a shifty government agent, and even a tyrannical President. It is set in a near-future United States where everything we know now has been changed and oppressed. When Colton finds the jacket, it sets off a chain of events unlike anything he has ever experienced before. This campaign is set to explain the second chapter of his, and everyone else's stories.
 

This story was created by Jason Biamonte (writer) and Randy Haldeman (artist). These are two guys fresh out of college trying to make it in the world of independent comics. They've got stories to tell, and are a looking for an audience to tell them to. We're based out of Strasburg, PA, a small town full of Amish and tourists. We are running a campaign to help support our comic that we've been writing and developing for the last three years. All of the story has been completely outlined and we are now looking to finish and print ALL of the issues. Chapter 1 has already been put into print thanks to all of the wonderful support of Indie GoGo a year ago. We've come back to ask for more support to assist printing of Chapter 2.
After we print Chapter 2 we will be headed to Baltimore Comic-Con (again) in September to release the comic. We've created a slew of great and very plentiful perks for our campaign. They are detailed a bit more below. With your support we will be able to print this book, and start on Chapter 3. After we release Chapter 2 (now that we're out of college) all of the other chapters of The Jacket will follow within months of one another leading up to an exciting finale in Chapter 9. Help us get there by supporting our first printing of Chapter 2!


 

We need $500 to cover printing costs for The Jacket: Chapter 2. Otherwise it will be out-of-pocket for a couple of college graduates with lots of debt to pay back. All of the money will go towards printing Chapter 2, acquiring an ISBN for the book, and getting perks out of the door. We have no other sources of income on this project, so whatever we make here will be the only money that we have to spend on the project. So as you can see, your contributions are EXTREMELY helpful.
 

We are on a flexible campaign so ANY money we get will go to printing and help fund this book. You'll still get any perk you contributed for no matter what. We just won't be able to print as many books, or supply the books with an ISBN for sale in stores.

<p><i>Chapter 1, Groundbreaking News</i> is about a new discovery! The Chapter starts off with a monologue, while scenes of a tragic incident from a memory are illustrated in the background. The monologue poses the question: if Earth was created with Elemental Energy, then what happened to those energy forces? According to the laws of Physics, energy can not be destroyed...it can only be transformed from one form to another!  </p>

<p>The story then diverts back to the present time and introduces our main character Chloe and her boyfriend. Chloe is obsessed with understanding the meaning behind elemental energies and goes from museum to museum to find out more about them. One day while on a museum tour, Chloe's boyfriend gets her a necklace. That day, her life changed forever.  </p>

<p><strong>ABOUT ME: </strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Zain and I’m the writer for The Elemental Balance. I’ve always had a passion for writing stories. In fact, my first story “Game Plan” was written to impress my wife. Spoiler alert, it paid off! I find it rewarding to bring entertainment to people, that’s my niche! My style of storytelling is grounded in reality but, nonetheless, is fiction. Characters are set in unrealistic situations but have very relatable emotions. Imagine if someone could achieve greatness with a determined will, how would they react if they had powers? This is what my stories are rooted in….emotions!  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544055742/w2uyerz1qpas00n5upwz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It’s fascinating what the human will allows us to achieve. They say the human body can bend steel, but the brain limits it. Isn’t it amazing how our body functions? The world around us is fascinating because its full of mysteries. Our reality seems fictitious because we’re a MIRACLE and the celebration of LIFE fuels the stories I write!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE ARTIST:</strong></p>
<p>Luke Horsman is an extremely talented artist from the UK. He is well versed in many forms of art mediums. In fact, Luke did the pencils, ink, and coloring for the first three chapters. His artwork has truly brought the characters from the script to life. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544055866/y1iwgihu7yza3ipkkju6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It's been a blast working with him. We mesh really well. I'm particular with scenes and visual symbolism and he's keen on creating eye-catching, bold illustrations. Together we made an excellent team!  </p>

<p><strong>INSPIRATION:  </strong></p>
<p>The story for the Elemental Balance spurred from a theory relating to actual history. It’s interesting that in ancient history, most civilizations believed the world comprised of 4 elements. Although these civilizations were geographically apart, they all believed in the SAME 4 elements; Earth, Water, Wind, and Fire. Although in modern science we know of a whole periodic table of elements, interestingly there are only 4 states of matter and these 4 states of matter closely resemble the attributes of the 4 elements. From that, one idea led to another, and the product of those combobulated ideas became the story foundation for the Elemental Balance. </p>

<p><strong>STATUS OF THE COMICS:  </strong></p>
<p>The entire Elemental Balance series story has been completely written and is going to be a 10-comic series. The pencils/inking/coloring and lettering have been completed for the first 3 chapters and have been entirely self-funded. We have already started working on Chapter 4 and anticipate it to be complete by the end of the year. For our current Indiegogo Campaign, we’ve decided to be proactive and have already reached out to vendors, received quotes, and identified preferred suppliers. In order to ensure quality, we took a step further and ordered samples at premium rates just to “feel” the quality. All that remains now is a successful campaign and sending those comics to you!</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THE FUNDS?  </strong></p>
<p>All the funds raised will be used towards funding the next issues of Elemental Balance. We want to make sure that those who supported the campaign get to enjoy the conclusion of the series. The cost will go towards the penciler, inker, and colorists and of course, the printer. It will also cover the cost of shipping and materials, taxes, and fees. </p>
<p>If we significantly surpass our goal, then the funds will be used to start artwork on our other comic book projects; Game Plan, The Lost King, and Humanimal Instincts. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544055254/nggko8ibay4bdgdxquua.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3> What's next for inZane Comics?  </h3>
<p>As soon as the campaign is successful, our main priority is fulfilling the pledge rewards. After that, we plan on completing the 10 comic book series for the Elemental Balance. </p>
<p>Aside from that, we have several comic book projects in draft such as The Lost King and Humanimal Instincts, which we plan on bringing online soon. We also have other storylines that are in the concept phase and don’t have a title yet. All these stories will tie into one ultimate story.  </p>
<p>We’re also working on unconventional comics that don’t necessarily follow the rules of traditional comics, which will be published under the ""inZane Chrome"" brand. These stories will be more relatable to graphic novel enthusiasts. The first one will be “The Game Plan” <i>(Remember, this is the one I wrote for my wife).</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544054839/pl5j9cqx6rxv94hfzljy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our long-term goal is to provide an avenue for young artists and writers to get their foot through the door in the comic industry. We plan on starting an inZane Summer internship program with students across the US. During this internship, selected students will create a comic book project from the ground up while being mentored by industry professionals.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The story is written, all of the artwork is completed, and the editor has reviewed the content. Suppliers have been evaluated and chosen for all merchandise. If we exceed our projected goal, then we'll start placing orders during the campaign to ensure supply continuity. </p>
<p>Delays could potentially happen in production due to the manufacturing process and all the moving parts. That's why we're taking the extra step and ordering comics during the campaign to mitigate any production delays. </p>

Come and join us on this thrilling adventure and escape into the inZane World of Elemental Balance!   
PARENTAL GUIDANCE: T+ TEENS AND UP – Appropriate for teens aged 13 years and above. May contain violence, suggestive themes, and/or crude humor.
So...What's the Story Like? It’s like if Avatar the Air bender merged with Netflix’s hit show Sense8...but without the rated R stuff of course! 
MEET THE ELEMENTALS:




 ELEMENTAL BALANCE CH 1 | GROUNDBREAKING NEWS

Chapter 1, Groundbreaking News is about a new discovery! The Chapter starts off with a monologue, while scenes of a tragic incident from a memory are illustrated in the background. The monologue poses the question: if Earth was created with Elemental Energy, then what happened to those energy forces? According to the laws of Physics, energy can not be destroyed...it can only be transformed from one form to another!  

The story then diverts back to the present time and introduces our main character Chloe and her boyfriend. Chloe is obsessed with understanding the meaning behind elemental energies and goes from museum to museum to find out more about them. One day while on a museum tour, Chloe's boyfriend gets her a necklace. That day, her life changed forever.  

That night Chloe has a vivid dream that she's in Nairobi, Kenya, running away from a mudslide. She gets buried under the mudslide and dies, only to wake up and be relieved that it was all just a dream. 

Or so she thought until she found out the next morning, her dream was real!

Find out what the meaning behind Chloe's dream is in Chapter 1, Ground Breaking News.

ELEMENTAL BALANCE CH 2 | WATER UNDER THE BRIDGE

Chapter 2,  Water under the Bridge title is an idiom that means to move on from the past. As the title suggests, this chapter will reveal Chloe's past. 
Chloe and her friend Jessi are on vacation for spring break. 

But as the day progresses, their perfect getaway turns into a nightmare. 

The cruise ship they were on, is engulfed by a massive tsunami! 

Find out how Chloe survives in Chapter 2, Water Under the Bridge. 

ELEMENTAL BALANCE CH 3 | UP IN AIR

Chapter 3, Up in Air  title is an idiom that means that there's uncertainty. Like the title suggests, this chapter will reveal several mysteries. Chloe and Baraka (the Earth Elemental) thought they were going to unite with the Wind Elemental, but a new threat is revealed to them.  
Chloe and Baraka arrive in Japan and head to a local internet cafe in hopes of finding clues to the whereabouts of the Wind Elemental.   

There they meet Satoshi, a local citizen who claims he knows where the tornado happened and offers to take them there.

Desperate for leads, Chloe and Baraka follow him, but what’s in store for them will surprise you!

Find out the major reveal in Chapter 3, Up in Air. 

CRITIC reviews: 
Here's Mike from ""Chico Comics Page"" review of ""The Elemental Balance"". Click Here for the full Article.
""In comics there are indie publishers, and then there are indie publishers. There was confidence in the writing, the art, and overall design of the book. The art in here is fantastic. Everything feels like a comic I should be reading off the stands.""

""I enjoyed every panel of this book, and hope to see a lot more from Luke. The pages have a lot of movement and detail. The characters look great against wonderful backgrounds. The pencils are up there with the best that I’ve seen from any company, large or indie. This book is definitely worth checking out.""

ABOUT ME: 
Hi, my name is Zain and I’m the writer for The Elemental Balance. I’ve always had a passion for writing stories. In fact, my first story “Game Plan” was written to impress my wife. Spoiler alert, it paid off! I find it rewarding to bring entertainment to people, that’s my niche! My style of storytelling is grounded in reality but, nonetheless, is fiction. Characters are set in unrealistic situations but have very relatable emotions. Imagine if someone could achieve greatness with a determined will, how would they react if they had powers? This is what my stories are rooted in….emotions!  

It’s fascinating what the human will allows us to achieve. They say the human body can bend steel, but the brain limits it. Isn’t it amazing how our body functions? The world around us is fascinating because its full of mysteries. Our reality seems fictitious because we’re a MIRACLE and the celebration of LIFE fuels the stories I write!
 
ABOUT THE ARTIST:
Luke Horsman is an extremely talented artist from the UK. He is well versed in many forms of art mediums. In fact, Luke did the pencils, ink, and coloring for the first three chapters. His artwork has truly brought the characters from the script to life. 

It's been a blast working with him. We mesh really well. I'm particular with scenes and visual symbolism and he's keen on creating eye-catching, bold illustrations. Together we made an excellent team!  
Check out Luke's website for awesome artwork by clicking here.

INSPIRATION:  
The story for the Elemental Balance spurred from a theory relating to actual history. It’s interesting that in ancient history, most civilizations believed the world comprised of 4 elements. Although these civilizations were geographically apart, they all believed in the SAME 4 elements; Earth, Water, Wind, and Fire. Although in modern science we know of a whole periodic table of elements, interestingly there are only 4 states of matter and these 4 states of matter closely resemble the attributes of the 4 elements. From that, one idea led to another, and the product of those combobulated ideas became the story foundation for the Elemental Balance. 



 


 


 

 
 

 











STATUS OF THE COMICS:  
The entire Elemental Balance series story has been completely written and is going to be a 10-comic series. The pencils/inking/coloring and lettering have been completed for the first 3 chapters and have been entirely self-funded. We have already started working on Chapter 4 and anticipate it to be complete by the end of the year. For our current Indiegogo Campaign, we’ve decided to be proactive and have already reached out to vendors, received quotes, and identified preferred suppliers. In order to ensure quality, we took a step further and ordered samples at premium rates just to “feel” the quality. All that remains now is a successful campaign and sending those comics to you!
WHAT WILL WE DO WITH THE FUNDS?  
All the funds raised will be used towards funding the next issues of Elemental Balance. We want to make sure that those who supported the campaign get to enjoy the conclusion of the series. The cost will go towards the penciler, inker, and colorists and of course, the printer. It will also cover the cost of shipping and materials, taxes, and fees. 
If we significantly surpass our goal, then the funds will be used to start artwork on our other comic book projects; Game Plan, The Lost King, and Humanimal Instincts. 



 What's next for inZane Comics?  
As soon as the campaign is successful, our main priority is fulfilling the pledge rewards. After that, we plan on completing the 10 comic book series for the Elemental Balance. 
Aside from that, we have several comic book projects in draft such as The Lost King and Humanimal Instincts, which we plan on bringing online soon. We also have other storylines that are in the concept phase and don’t have a title yet. All these stories will tie into one ultimate story.  
We’re also working on unconventional comics that don’t necessarily follow the rules of traditional comics, which will be published under the ""inZane Chrome"" brand. These stories will be more relatable to graphic novel enthusiasts. The first one will be “The Game Plan” (Remember, this is the one I wrote for my wife).

The Impact
Our long-term goal is to provide an avenue for young artists and writers to get their foot through the door in the comic industry. We plan on starting an inZane Summer internship program with students across the US. During this internship, selected students will create a comic book project from the ground up while being mentored by industry professionals.

Risks & Challenges
The story is written, all of the artwork is completed, and the editor has reviewed the content. Suppliers have been evaluated and chosen for all merchandise. If we exceed our projected goal, then we'll start placing orders during the campaign to ensure supply continuity. 
Delays could potentially happen in production due to the manufacturing process and all the moving parts. That's why we're taking the extra step and ordering comics during the campaign to mitigate any production delays. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Sometimes budgets are tight, and we understand if you can't contribute.  But you still can help us out tremendously if you can get the word out.
The easiest way to do that is by using the Indiegogo share tools.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Like many guys in my generation, I grew up reading comic books and dreamed of someday drawing my favorite heroes.  However, as I got older, I began to realize that the real fun isn't rehashing the same ol' same ol'...the REAL fun is creating your own characters and stories.  Not just retreading old Stan Lee and Jack Kirby characters, but BEING YOUR OWN STAN LEE AND JACK KIRBY!</p>
<p>So, I am a SELF-PUBLISHER, which means I have the freedom to tell whatever story I wish and draw it how I see fit.  This also means I am financially responsible for getting my stories published.  As a Junior High Art teacher and father of 2, this can prove to be...difficult. </p>
<p>This IndieGoGo campaign will help me publish a comic book that is fun, original, and important; without spending my kids' college fund!  People who donate will be supporting the independent spirit that makes this country great gives the little guy a fighting chance in this competitive market!</p>
<p>Help that little kid daydreaming of making his own comics realize his dream!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for $1500, which is no small amount.  So every dollar helps.  This money will go strickly for printing the comic book.  I am not going to use the money to suppoprt my family or my Scotch habit.  I will be starting off with a small print run of a FULL COLOR comic book, and the $1500 will help that happen!</p>
<p>I am offering some pretty cool incentives, things that I would dig as a comic book fan.  Everything from signed copies of the book, prints of the cover signed by myslef and cover artist Jeff Herndon, original art by me, and your chance to be featured in a page of the comic book!!!</p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Con Job is just like Oceans 11, if it was about 3 geeks getting revenge for the wrongs of the past and it took place at a comic convention instead of Vegas!</p>
<p>This is a story for anyone who believes in creator owned rights and standing up against giant corporations that use the ideas of artists to make billions, chew them up, and spit them out.</p>
<p>My first self published graphic novel Kidnapping Kevin Smith was very well recieved world wide and made a name (albiet small) for me in the comics world.  Hopefully the Con Job will continue this success. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need to raise at least $200 to afford packaging and print production costs on the cards.  BUT if we can raise the extra $200, then it would help us to afford the shipping costs and promotional costs of marketing the set.  Now, this is more of a pre-order sale than do-or-die fundraiser, but the benefits to contributing definitely end up working in favor for you!  We've got our books for sale at less than cover price as well as pre-orders for the card set at less than the $10 a pack price. <br/><br/>There are 50 extremely talented artists contributing original art to this set - original art that can be yours for fractions of what they would be worth otherwise!  With a 50% chance of getting original art in each pack, it truly is a great deal.  Each 3 card pack of cards comes with 2 base cards and either a signed base card by an Alterna creator OR an original sketch card from one of 50 artists. <br/><br/>

</div></div>","Our Story

IndieGoGo and all of our amazing contributors from our last fundraiser helped us to survive for a few more years and because of that generosity, we can now move forward with an idea we've had in the works for a few years now!

Come and celebrate our 5th Year Anniversary with Alterna's first trading card set that centers around the amazing creator-owned characters that have graced the pages of Alterna Comics' graphic novels!This 5 card set will also feature 250 sketch cards that will be comprised entirely of original, hand-drawn, one-of-a-kind sketch cards created by 50 different artists, including Alterna's very own talented creators!

A lot of the artists involved are getting the chance to see their work published for the first time.  It's a dream come true for many of them - a dream that we hope they get a chance to fulfill.  There's also veteran artists on here that are lending their skills towards bringing the characters at Alterna to life in their own unique visions.
Here's the artist roster:
Daniel Gorman, Kelly Williams, Jacob Rozen, Brian Beardsley, j(ay), Jiba Molei Anderson, John J.C. Bulmer, Peter Simeti, Michael Bracco, Bret Herholz, Jeff McComsey, Jeremy Massie, Rafer Roberts, Neil Makohon, Gary Kezele, Thomas Makoto, Stephanie O'Donnell, Rusty Gilligan, Mike Thomas, George Amaru, Joe Palumbo, Chadwick Haverland, Jason Shoemaker, Nicholas P.

<h3>What the Heck is Going On Here?</h3>
<p>Authors and Dragons is an infamous Dungeons and Dragons podcast, where six comedy fantasy authors try to survive a world of might and magic, often with hilarious results. Not so long ago they teamed up with artist John Luther Davis to provide artwork for their patreon supporters, and the Chronicles of Calamity comic adventure was born.</p>
<p>Blending their irreverent humour with high-octane fantasy action, Chronicles of Calamity is blunt-edge mayhem for fans of fantasy adventure and worlds of might and magic.</p>
<p>Issue one is 24 pages of action and comedy, with our unlikley heroes placed slap bang in the middle of a demonic invasion!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We'd love to see this comic book break free of the Patreon paywall and get out into the world with physical copies. The easiest way to make sure that the comic gets into the hands of people who want them is through crowd funding. And the best part is, Issue 1 of the comic is complete and ready to go.</p>
<p>All we need are your contributions to cover the cost of print and delivery. That's it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There's a minimum cost to printing enough physical copies to make this affordable, and if we don't meet that cost, we won't be able to follow through. We need your help to ensure as many backers as possible to get this baby out into the world.</p>

I wanted a story with a woman who wasn't a walking cliche as the star, actually getting to pilot the robot and do the fighting! I worked hard to create a main character who wasn't an Emotionless Doll, an Airhead, or a Man With Boobs, which was what I commonly saw from the female characters in this genre. I wanted to make a well rounded protagonist, someone who wasn't there to support the men's story, but had her own story.</div><div>And, most importantly, was in charge of piloting the dang robot.<br/>
</div><div> <h3></h3>This is the story of Sarah Bryant, a pretty typical young woman who likes to race motorcycles, fix cars, and collect tabloid articles about the supposed giant robot that has been hidden on her parent's ranch since the 1970's. One day, she is out racing her motorcycle when suddenly three men in suits show up and start shooting lasers at her! That's when she discovers that Adrastus, the giant alien robot from the planet Ankali, is real! Now Sarah, with the help of her government-issued bodyguard secret agent Michael Baxter, must learn to pilot Adrastus against the evil forces of the Varugo. Along the way, she learns about her own strength, and about the power of family.<p></p> </div><div style=""text-align: center;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443461134/c4qskm36hreqlwnhkcxt.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 284.8px; height: 356px;""/></p></div><div><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">This story is my modern love letter to the 70's and 80's giant robot genre of anime. It uses many tropes popular in the mecha genre (such as Calling Your Attack), but puts a parody twist on them when they're looked at through the eyes of a more modern audience. Though much of the influence comes from the mecha (giant robot) genre, it is also a story about family, friendship, and humanity. Most of my regular readers online are not hard-core fans of the mecha genre, but they find Adrastus' characters lovable and the story engaging. </span><br/></p></div><div>

</div></div>","When I created Adrastus back in 2007, I wanted to make something a little different from most of the giant robot stories I'd seen. I wanted a story with a woman who wasn't a walking cliche as the star, actually getting to pilot the robot and do the fighting! I worked hard to create a main character who wasn't an Emotionless Doll, an Airhead, or a Man With Boobs, which was what I commonly saw from the female characters in this genre. I wanted to make a well rounded protagonist, someone who wasn't there to support the men's story, but had her own story.And, most importantly, was in charge of piloting the dang robot.
 This is the story of Sarah Bryant, a pretty typical young woman who likes to race motorcycles, fix cars, and collect tabloid articles about the supposed giant robot that has been hidden on her parent's ranch since the 1970's. One day, she is out racing her motorcycle when suddenly three men in suits show up and start shooting lasers at her! That's when she discovers that Adrastus, the giant alien robot from the planet Ankali, is real! Now Sarah, with the help of her government-issued bodyguard secret agent Michael Baxter, must learn to pilot Adrastus against the evil forces of the Varugo. Along the way, she learns about her own strength, and about the power of family. This story is my modern love letter to the 70's and 80's giant robot genre of anime. It uses many tropes popular in the mecha genre (such as Calling Your Attack), but puts a parody twist on them when they're looked at through the eyes of a more modern audience. Though much of the influence comes from the mecha (giant robot) genre, it is also a story about family, friendship, and humanity. Most of my regular readers online are not hard-core fans of the mecha genre, but they find Adrastus' characters lovable and the story engaging. 
What We Need & What You Get
 This project will fund the completion and printing of ""Adrastus: Book 3"", as well as allow me to print more of Books 1 and 2! Each book is a softcover, black and white interior with a beautiful color exterior, and is around 150-200 pages. The books all include comics originally published on adrastuscomic.com, as well as bonus content, sketches, concept art, and more not found anywhere online! 


Over half of the money from this goal is going to go to printing books and getting them shipped to me from the printer. Another 10% is the shipping from me to you, the backers! Around 10% is going to buy shipping supplies like boxes and envelopes to protect these delightful books as they journey to you. I've allocated 15% for miscellaneous fees, such as crowdfunding fees and credit card processing fees. 

PDF Files: Strictly digital with your comics these days? We've got you covered. You can get one PDF or a PDF bundle in most reward tiers.
Physical Copies of Books: This is what this campaign is all about, getting these pages to print! The lower physical book reward tier will get you a copy of book three (great for those who already have books one and two!) 





Inked Sketch inside of book (Artist's Edition)- Want the inside of your book personalized? This is available as a $35 tier for just Book Three, or as an add-on if you're getting more than one book. Check the A La Carte section for pricing.
Commissioned Artwork: Want something a little bigger? Higher reward tiers include an 11x17 Pencil drawing commission. This will be done on Bristol board and limited to two characters, please. Absolutely no: pornography, excessive gore. Subjects I will draw: human characters, furries/anthro, chibi characters, robots. If you want a portrait done of a real person it will be done in a stylized manner- either comic or chibi, your choice. 

(Example of 11x14 grayscale marker artwork) 
Original Comic Pages: Did you know that the first few pages of Adrastus were made on paper, with pencil and ink? I have 12 originals, spanning the first cover and the first 10 pages of the story, that I am offering up for the first time ever in this campaign! You can own a piece of Adrastus history that will come to you boarded and bagged, with a certificate of authenticity.



Custom Wordpress Theme from C.A. Morgan!: The incredible C.A. Morgan has offered up a custom wordpress theme design! To see an example of their work, take a look at the Adrastus web-site. C.A. did the coding and layout design (helped by some custom art from me, of course!) There are restrictions to this tier and they are as follows:

This reward is for a custom theme for the Wordpress platform.
Can be for a comic site or non-comic site.
The lucky backer will receive an initial consultation with several concepts to choose from for their design.
Backer will not receive any work or consultation until their pledge has cleared and the money is in Liz's hands.
Backer should have rudimentary knowledge of how to operate a Wordpress site. If the backer makes code changes on their custom theme later and breaks the theme, this pledge tier does not necessarily constitute an agreement that C.A. Morgan will fix the broken theme.



The Impact
 This campaign will not only allow me to print the brand new (and long-awaited) third collection of the story, but it will also allow me to restock my copies of books one and two. I've totally sold out of my copies of Book One, and only have a few copies of Book Two left!

Thanks for making this campaign a success! You helped us bring down our costs and--more importantly--spread the word about ComicBlanks.
What's next?
The new books are hot off the press, and all perks will be shipped out over the next few days.
Your sketchbook preference: The hardcover sketchbooks come in two styles: ""Freehand"" (pink) or ""Ruled"" (turquoise). If you haven't already done so, let us know your preference ASAP; if you want more than one, you can mix and match styles.
More new products
We will soon be offering a ""Freehand"" version of the Student Edition notebook, and we're planning other new and exciting products as well. Keep an eye on our website. If you'd like to receive occasional updates from us, send us an email with the subject line ""Sign Me Up!""
More ways you can help
If you'd like to see ComicBlanks in your local stores and schools, here are a few things you can do:
Support retailers that carry ComicBlanks: Visit any of the retailers currently carrying our books, or order them online at Opus.
Demand ComicBlanks: Ask your local store or distributor to carry ComicBlanks. If your local school is printing single pages of comic book templates for classroom assignments, let them know that our Student Edition is an economical alternative.
Referrals: If you know of any schools, stores, or distributors who might be interested in ComicBlanks, let us know! You might be eligible for a referral fee; contact us for more details.
Outside North America: If you would like to buy ComicBlanks outside of the US or Canada, please ask your local retailer to get in touch with us. We are currently working on ways to get the books into stores in Europe and Australia. If you'd like to become a distributor in your local area, please let us know.

We are excited to hear your feedback about the new and improved hardcover sketchbooks (with 70 lb. paper) as well as the Student Edition notebooks.
Please address all email to plutonicpress@plutonicpress.com
Thanks again to everybody for supporting this campaign!

The Indiegogo Campaign
ComicBlanks are sketchbooks with pre-printed comic panels! Designed for anybody planning a graphic novel or other visual art project, ComicBlanks sketchbooks are also perfect for comic jams and cartoon diaries.
And they make a great gift for professional and aspiring cartoonists, animators, and manga artists!


 

 

There are two different hardcover sketchbooks to choose from, ""Freehand Panels"" or ""Ruled Panels."" For more details, visit our website at comicblanks.com or plutonicpress.com
Both of our hardcover sketchbooks contain 60 pages of 70 lb. paper stock.

We're also testing a new product this season: A 40-page softcover Student Edition/Manga Notebook. Similar to a classroom exercise book, it measures 7"" X 8.5"".

It’s perfect for classrooms, car trips, plane rides, and public transit commutes. Manga fans can flip to the other side of the book and start from the back.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">avventura s. f. – 1. b.<i> Impresa rischiosa ma attraente e piena di fascino...</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BOLIDE</strong> è un progetto che unisce alcuni tra i migliori fumettisti del panorama italiano contemporaneo e il classico fumetto avventuroso. Abbiamo chiamato a raccolta<strong> </strong>alcuni tra i migliori <strong>fumettisti</strong> <strong>contemporanei</strong> e assegnato loro <strong>7 generi</strong> diversi con cui cimentarsi. Avranno a disposizione <strong>30 pagine</strong> in formato<strong> striscia </strong>21x10 per piegare le convezioni di genere e far rivivere a modo loro la <i><strong>spy story</strong></i>, la <i><strong>space opera</strong>,<strong> </strong></i>il <i><strong>cavalleresco</strong>,</i> il<strong> <i>fumetto di guerra</i></strong>,  il <i><strong>crime</strong>,</i> il <i><strong>western </strong></i>e<i><strong> </strong></i>il <i><strong>tarzanide</strong></i>.</p>
<p>Le 7 strisce verranno poi racchiuse in un <strong>cofanetto</strong>, una confezione di <strong>design</strong> appositamente realizzata per non sfigurare all'interno delle <strong>librerie</strong> degli appassionati di fumetto.</p>
<p>A tre anni dalla sua fondazione e dopo più di dodici mesi di progettazione, l'associazione culturale <a href=""http://www.amiantocomics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Amianto Comics</strong></a> lancia il suo <strong>primo crowdfunding.</strong> Dopo aver dato alle stampe più di un migliaio di pagine di<strong> fumetto autoprodotto</strong> - tra cui il quadrimestrale <i>Amianto</i>, la collana di graphic novel <i>Amianto Comics Presenta</i>, il webcomic <i>Smokey</i> e progetti sperimentali come <i>I Fiori del Male</i> e <i>Il Corvo</i> della linea <i>Reflusso </i>- crediamo sia arrivato il momento di alzare l'asticella, ma per farlo <strong>abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto!</strong></p>
<p><strong>BOLIDE </strong>verrà stampato solo se riusciremo a raggiungere la cifra necessaria. Aiutandoci, oltre alle 7 strisce, potrete ricevere <strong>gadget</strong> ed <strong>edizioni limitate</strong> realizzate con la collaborazione dei nostri <strong>partner</strong>, tre giovani realtà <strong>artigianali</strong> del territorio: <strong><a href=""https://www.trasandostuff.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TRASANDO STUFF</a>, <a href=""http://www.woodbe.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Woodbe</a></strong> e <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pennacchipipe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pennacchi Pipe</a>.</b></p>
<p><strong>N.B.</strong> Se la campagna avrà successo,<strong> BOLIDE</strong> sarà disponibile a partire da <strong>novembre 2019</strong>, in occasione di <i><strong>Lucca Comics &amp; Games</strong></i>, ma solo tramite la campagna crowdfunding sarà possibile ottenere<strong> perk esclusivi</strong> <strong>e</strong> <strong>limitati</strong> e sbloccare i nostri <strong>stretch goal!</strong></p>

avventura s. f. – 1. b. Impresa rischiosa ma attraente e piena di fascino...
 
BOLIDE è un progetto che unisce alcuni tra i migliori fumettisti del panorama italiano contemporaneo e il classico fumetto avventuroso. Abbiamo chiamato a raccolta alcuni tra i migliori fumettisti contemporanei e assegnato loro 7 generi diversi con cui cimentarsi. Avranno a disposizione 30 pagine in formato striscia 21x10 per piegare le convezioni di genere e far rivivere a modo loro la spy story, la space opera, il cavalleresco, il fumetto di guerra,  il crime, il western e il tarzanide.
Le 7 strisce verranno poi racchiuse in un cofanetto, una confezione di design appositamente realizzata per non sfigurare all'interno delle librerie degli appassionati di fumetto.
A tre anni dalla sua fondazione e dopo più di dodici mesi di progettazione, l'associazione culturale Amianto Comics lancia il suo primo crowdfunding. Dopo aver dato alle stampe più di un migliaio di pagine di fumetto autoprodotto - tra cui il quadrimestrale Amianto, la collana di graphic novel Amianto Comics Presenta, il webcomic Smokey e progetti sperimentali come I Fiori del Male e Il Corvo della linea Reflusso - crediamo sia arrivato il momento di alzare l'asticella, ma per farlo abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto!
BOLIDE verrà stampato solo se riusciremo a raggiungere la cifra necessaria. Aiutandoci, oltre alle 7 strisce, potrete ricevere gadget ed edizioni limitate realizzate con la collaborazione dei nostri partner, tre giovani realtà artigianali del territorio: TRASANDO STUFF, Woodbe e Pennacchi Pipe.
N.B. Se la campagna avrà successo, BOLIDE sarà disponibile a partire da novembre 2019, in occasione di Lucca Comics & Games, ma solo tramite la campagna crowdfunding sarà possibile ottenere perk esclusivi e limitati e sbloccare i nostri stretch goal!
 
__________________________

 
Ecco gli autori che hanno accettato di cimentarsi in questa ardita impresa!
 
NOVA
(This Is Not A Love Song, BAO Publishing, Progetto Stigma) racconterà un'avventurosa spy story, ""Combat Geghegè"", ispirata da un classico come Modesty Blaise.

 
TUONO PETTINATO
(GRRRzetic, Rizzoli Lizard, Longanesi, Linus, Internazionale) rivolterà come un calzino la space opera a la Flash Gordon per raccontare le storture dell’Italia contemporanea con i suoi “Sindaci”.

 
FRANCESCO GUARNACCIA
(Mammaiuto, Shockdom, Rizzoli, Internazionale, Bao Publishing) narrerà le ardimentose imprese ""cavalleresche"" di ""Pick-up Prince"", un odierno Prince Valiant.

 
SPUGNA
(Grrrz Comic Art Book, Hollow Press, Progetto Stigma) in ""Franco e i Tagliagole"" se la vedrà con pirati, battaglie navali e mari d'Oriente seguendo l'esempio di Terry e i pirati.

 

TADDEI e ANGELINI

(Bel Ami Edizioni, Grrrz Comic Art Book, Panini Comics, Coconino) rovistano nei meandri del crime con ""L'ISPETTORE"", un emulo perverso di Dick Tracy.

 
VINCENZO FILOSA
(Canicola, Coconino) Da sempre un insospettabile e vorace lettore di Tex, Vincenzo vi trasporterà nel suo intimo e personalissimo selvaggio West con ""le avventure di Cane Malato"".

 

ALMAFE' & FEDERICO FABBRI

(Amianto Comics, Edizioni BD) vi teletrasportano in una giungla fatta di liane tossiche e realismo capitalista in compagnia di ""Giungla Giorgio"". Un Tarzan post-apocalittico.

 
_______________________________

 
BOLIDE: sette fumetti inediti in formato striscia 21x10, spillati, composti da 30 pagine bianco e nero e una copertina a colori.
Fedeli alla filosofia che da sempre anima le scelte editoriali di Amianto Comics, abbiamo concepito BOLIDE con l'idea di far collidere due categorie che nel fumetto troppo spesso tendono a ignorarsi: il ""genere"" e ""l'autore"". I fumettisti coinvolti hanno accettato con entusiasmo questa sfida, con concept incredibili e geniali pagine di anteprima! Noi non vediamo l'ora di mandare in stampa questi gioiellini, ma voi dovrete aiutarci!

Honestly, I’m surprised it took me this long to finally make a real comic. It wasn’t until I became a father that I had anything to say I thought was worth sharing with others. Specifically, with my kids.</p><p>I wanted to make something for them which featured influences and aspects of as many Asian cultures as possible. There is an incredible wealth of material to explore, and the vast majority of it is so rarely highlighted. The thing is, even though I grew up in South East Asia, I didn’t grow up with Asian comics. Instead, I had Marvel, DC, Asterix, Tintin and Calvin &amp; Hobbes.</p><p>This project had to be something that I could personally really get into, and also share with my young children. I love how The Avengers, Samurai Jack, Batman: the Animated Series, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark and Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl manage to balance being serious and light-hearted, while being jam-packed with action from the word “go”.</p><p>I also wanted to have several female protagonists. Though the idea of comics aimed at both young girls and boys has seen a lot of improvement in recent years, in relative terms, there’s still not all that much out there for them.</p><p>I want my daughter to have more female role models that she can not only look up to, but relate to, as a girl growing up in multi-racial Malaysia. I also want to teach my son to respect women, and this seemed like a good way to do it,</p><p>Ultimately, you could say that this project is my hope for my kids: to live a life of adventure, to have a positive group of close and supportive friends, to always help those in need, and to grow up to be a strong, confident and caring people. And to know that if they turn out to be smartasses, it's cool with their dad (but not their mom).</p><p>After a year of collaboration with Zie, here we are: two guys from Kuala Lumpur, with an American-style comic, about an Asian-inspired fantasy universe, that I created specifically for my kids. Everything that led to this point was like a perfect storm and I don’t think there’s another story that I could have told right now.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Is this book for you?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>From Scotland who has been living in Toronto for over 5 years now, I am a full time character designer by day and comic artist at night.</li>
<li>The campaign is to help support the print costs for both book and enamel pins -  I have ad this story in my head for some time and I want to share this with you all, reveal these characters and the world they live in.</li>
<li>You will help me express something so deep and personal -  After losing someone very dear to me last year in the summer I took some time off to recover, but more then ever I am more and ready to work hard and get the story out to the world!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>$1500 would be ideal to cover the costs of book prints (done locally), enamel stock and shipping as those are coming from the States!</li>
<li>The book will be very high quality -  10 page preview of finished pages,  development of the story and art, character designs, and Illustrations associated with the series. Lots of art to study and see the process of making a comic!</li>
<li>If I do go over ( that would be awesome) I would pout the rest of the money to more print costs for future shows that I will be attending over the summer. Also for those who contribute a lot will have a signed copy of the book and posted to them :)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a story I have had developing in my head for some time and I am more then ever motivated to get this drawn and scripted for the world to read.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:

From Scotland who has been living in Toronto for over 5 years now, I am a full time character designer by day and comic artist at night.
The campaign is to help support the print costs for both book and enamel pins -  I have ad this story in my head for some time and I want to share this with you all, reveal these characters and the world they live in.
You will help me express something so deep and personal -  After losing someone very dear to me last year in the summer I took some time off to recover, but more then ever I am more and ready to work hard and get the story out to the world!


What We Need & What You Get
 

$1500 would be ideal to cover the costs of book prints (done locally), enamel stock and shipping as those are coming from the States!
The book will be very high quality -  10 page preview of finished pages,  development of the story and art, character designs, and Illustrations associated with the series. Lots of art to study and see the process of making a comic!
If I do go over ( that would be awesome) I would pout the rest of the money to more print costs for future shows that I will be attending over the summer. Also for those who contribute a lot will have a signed copy of the book and posted to them :)


The Impact
Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:

It's a story I have had developing in my head for some time and I am more then ever motivated to get this drawn and scripted for the world to read. It will feature a lot of personal challenges and unique perspectives that will touch a lot of hearts. Not trying to sound corny but this story is a representation of my life and struggles but also overcoming these obstacles. I have characters that I am discovering myself and the story it evolving to something quite special.
This book is to show you what I have in mind and what I want to create, I adore storytelling and this one is gonna be a good one! it's going to have it all  -  true crime, loss, childhood into adulthood and action! Kinda dark but very real issues are going to be addressed and represented in a beautiful artistic way that I hope the audience will enjoy.
I want to have this book and pins available for TCAF 11th- 12th of May.  I will be selling them at my table. 


Risks & Challenges

If the worse comes I will have to shorten the  total amount of pages in the book -  but I am already in schedule for the comic to be made so the 10 pages will at least be available. 
Like I mentioned I am on schedule - I will have content to show and the pins will be on time. But if the worst is to come then I would just ship signed books to contributes.

<b>I'm Rob Mulligan(from the video) and I'm creating/producing a comic book called ""Mulligan"" about an unconventional hero and a multibillion dollar company turning people into fuel, using portals to other dimensions, conspiracy theories and absolute gory violence!</b> Mulligan has 2 twisted stories planned for this fundraising campaign, issues #1-5 and issues #6-10. You follow Mulligan along his journey for revenge and second chances, learning of his disturbing upbringing and medical conditions. You watch as he destroys everything in his path searching for answers while doing his ""job"".

Will you help me bring it to life? I'm working 7 days a week at this, and putting in my own money and time but I need some help! I'm not looking for a hand out to live or to buy me stuff. I'm just looking for fans to be part of this comic by helping me with printing the series for distribution. I hope you

<p>Thank you.</p></div>","At it's roots, Chimneyspeak is an adult, action-packed ""crimepunk"" comic set in Victorian era London. Deeper, the comic is a Great Expectations parody, a Dickensian take on London's criminal underbelly, and satire on the ""rags to riches"" style of Victorian storytelling. 
Chimneyspeak is an adults only webcomic that can be read here! It updates every Monday and Thursday without delay, starring a host of colourful and diverse characters, a dark and gritty storyline and a slew of extra ""penny dreadfuls"" that provide backstory, origin tales or just a few more laughs!

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Wrath tells the story of a young man named Doug who learns he has the ability to manifest the dark emotions of the abusive childhood he thought he left behind. Chapter 2 continues the story as Doug, along with his best friend Nicole, start to piece together the events from Chapter 1. Eventually the pair reveal the dormant power within Doug and must come to grips with this strange new ability, hoping he is  strong enough to control it.</p>
<p>Want to catch up on the story? You can get the digital catch up tier or add the digital version of Chapter 1 to any other tier you select.

<h3>Funding and Tiers</h3>
<p>As with our previous campaign we have a variant cover that will only be available during the live campaign. For chapter 2 we brought in the talented Roslynn Sommers to create our variant cover.

<h3>The current state of the project.</h3>
<p>As of launch we have funded 10 pages of chapter 2 and plan to add 24 additional pages to complete this chapter.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This will be our second run at crowdfunding a comic so we expect to have the same success we had with the previous campaign as far as budgeting and production of the comic. Where we fell short last time was the printing process. We have worked on this with Wikid Publishing and we will be going with a faster more reliable printing service. There will be other campaigns going before us so we do not expect any additional issues.</p>

<p>Grand Rising my friends, my name is Mr. Chi and I am a Zen Artist who has been practicing and teaching Art Therapy for the past 10 years. I wanted to share my knowledge and wisdom about the natural healing benefits of the creative process.  So, I built my dream company called Jeanyes Eco Arts N Supplies ( J.E.A.N S) where I transform unwanted jeans into patented primed wrist band canvases. Artists of all ages and skill levels can decorate them, wear them, sell them, trade them, give them away or exchange for donations to help raise money. </p>
<p>As a company, my primary goal is to inspire the next generation of Artists to practice using their creative outlets everyday. The creative process has magical healing powers that allow the Mind to quiet itself, the Body to relax and the Spirit to awaken. Art Therapy has been proven to help kids suffering from life threatening illnesses such as Cancer, kids on the Spectrum, and those who have Downs Syndrome, ADD/ADHD. Leaning disabilities and anger issues. I have created 3 programs that all use my wrist band canvases to help them practice Art Therapy everyday while earning money, raising money and helping themselves and others in need, </p>
<p>1) Artrepreneur  - This program teaches students how to use our simple 4 step business plan to start and grow their own Jeanyes small business. 1) Buy our canvases, 2) Decorate them in their unique style, 3) Sell them to supporters 4) Repeat the process</p>
<p>2) Anti Bullying - Art connects us All so this program connects students by transforming them into Jeanyes Creators who must follow a code known RAP.  Respect each others artwork, Accept one another for who they choose to be and Protect one another from bullies. The more Jeanyes Creators in each school, the more connected the students become, the less chances of bullying or being bullied. </p>
<p>3) Fun-Raising - This program teaches kids how to decorate the bands in the colors and theme that represents the organization that supports them, then exchange their artwork for donations instead of candy popcorn and candles to help raise money. Our program can help schools, sports teams, kid's organizations, hospitals, foster homes, churches and charities. The money raised can be used to purchase school supplies, sports equipment, musical instruments, field trips, missions and hospital bills.  </p>
</div><div>
<p>Due to COVID, I was able to visit schools, hospitals and kid's organizations to promote my brand, sell my products, teach my classes or market my company. So, I decided to write a Story/Coloring/Comic book called The Super Healers. I will transform kids in Super Healers, which are Superheros whose super powers are hidden within their their creative outlets. Every issue will be a positive story about different Super Healers and how the used their healing powers to create positive changes in the world. The 1st issue is the story of Mr. Chi who travels to hospitals and schools teaching kids about the Super Healing powers of the creative process and the natural healing benefits of practicing Art Therapy every day. He was sent to planet Earth to build an Army of young Super Healers who use their powers to help themselves and others win the battle over any illness. On the back of the book is a contest where kids can enter their own story of how their Super Healer character </p>
<p>I am asking for $10,000 which will allow me to afford the following 1) first printing run of 500 comic books, secure a storefront to rent space where we can collect the jeans, hand craft the wrist bands and hire Artists to decorate the bands and teach classes at this space. For every $20 donation, you will receive 1 copy of the book and 1 will be paid forward to a child in the hospital.  Thank you for your contributions that will help me help kids in need of healing, selling my comic books and launching my dream business, JeanYes.  </p>

So, I decided to write a Story/Coloring/Comic book called The Super Healers. I will transform kids in Super Healers, which are Superheros whose super powers are hidden within their their creative outlets. Every issue will be a positive story about different Super Healers and how the used their healing powers to create positive changes in the world. The 1st issue is the story of Mr. Chi who travels to hospitals and schools teaching kids about the Super Healing powers of the creative process and the natural healing benefits of practicing Art Therapy every day. He was sent to planet Earth to build an Army of young Super Healers who use their powers to help themselves and others win the battle over any illness. On the back of the book is a contest where kids can enter their own story of how their Super Healer character 
I am asking for $10,000 which will allow me to afford the following 1) first printing run of 500 comic books, secure a storefront to rent space where we can collect the jeans, hand craft the wrist bands and hire Artists to decorate the bands and teach classes at this space. For every $20 donation, you will receive 1 copy of the book and 1 will be paid forward to a child in the hospital.  Thank you for your contributions that will help me help kids in need of healing, selling my comic books and launching my dream business, JeanYes.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Hello, I'm Sam Bordon and I'm creating a comic book named ""The Paradox War"" with my cousin Damon Maes.</div>
<div>Creating a comic book has been our dream for some time now, ever since I was young I collected comic books, I started out reading Spider-Man, and introduced my cousin to comics some time later.</div>
<div>We sat down to describe a plot, and have currently written enough script for five issues, but we don't have the money the create them.</div>
<div>Creating a comic is expensive, 1100 Dollar goes to the artist, Gabriel Roswell. Other money goes to advertisement. </div>
<div>If we far exceed our goal of 1300 Dollar on the other hand, we could give you so much more quality. We could hire a professional letterer,colourist or artist. </div><div>If we don't raise money for coloured art, we will at least try to make it black/white art.</div><div>
<br/>The comic itself will be avaible to buy digitally and will be written in the English language.</div>
<div>But you are now wondering about the story, right?</div>

<h2>Original Artwork</h2>
<p>I'm a huge fan of original artwork and there's some amazing pieces on offer in this campaign. All the artwork is shown below and are <strong>A4</strong> (8.3 x 11.75 inches) in size. The superheroes are inked and coloured by <strong>Sebastian Navas</strong> who provides some of the interior pages of the artwork. Also on offer is the greyscale card artwork by <strong>Elena Ominetti</strong>.</p>
<p>It is very important to note that although all care is taken with the artwork, original artwork is<i> never in perfect condition</i>. There might be some slight imperfections depending on how the artist has stored or shipped them etc. It does not detract from the piece and would still be amazing framed.</p>

<h2>How to help?</h2>
<p>Firstly <strong>thank you</strong> for making it this far! I hoped you enjoyed seeing the Transhuman story and the incredible rewards. I have fulfiled multiple campaigns and have kept backers informed through the process. If you can support this project, that would be appreciated. Sharing the link around will be amazing and that would help get as many people as possible checking out this campaign! </p>
</div></div>","Transhuman - Rivka's Story is written by Stephen Kok (5 Seconds, Terralympus and Word Smith) cover and interior artwork by Allen Sands and coloured by Chris Pitcairn (Fox and Hound and The Hell Courtesan).

The variant cover is done by Von Randal (Dragons, Terralympus and XCT) and coloured by Kevin Anthony De Castro. I loved how this cover turned out! This is Rivka when she was still serving in the army.

Transhuman - Rivka's Story is a perfect bound 60 page (Final page count to be confirmed), fully coloured graphic novel printed on 150gsm glossy interior paper and a 250gsm cardstock cover at standard comic size 260mm x 170mm (10.2"" x 6.7""). (For those unfamiliar with gsm, I'm a bit of a paper snob and this is high end paper!) 
 

Transhuman - Rivka's Story details the world on the precipice of a major technologically shift. Suddenly no one isn't limited to the capabilities of the human body and with the right augmentation is able to transcend them. Follow Rivka (she's a transhuman) as she gets caught between two opposing views while having to resolve a dark secret from her past.





 

Rivka is an ex-soldier currently working as a bodyguard for hire. After an accident in the field, she had her right eye, ear and hand replaced with cybernetics. Her augmentations are connected directly via a neural link allowing her to perform superhuman actions.


Rivka still has flashbacks to that fateful event. She lives alone and her home life is a mess. She still carries a deep guilt from her previous life as well as coping with divorce proceedings which she suppresses with a nightly bottle of red. Even with the augmentations to be more than human, she can't escape the realities of her every day problems.




Want more artwork?
 Of course! Here's more completed artwork. 



Still want more?
Sure. Here's a couple more inked pages! It's still going through the colouring process and should be all completed by the end of this campaign. 

Want EVEN more?
OK! There's a 3 page prologue to the graphic novel with artwork by Sebastian Navas and coloured by Kevin Anthony De Castro in production. Here's a sneak peek at the layouts.

<h2 style=""font-size: 16px;"">Chicken Outfit - The Hellish First Issue</h2>
<p>Rusty McDoodle isn't having the best week. His web clients aren’t paying, his girlfriend left him and his social skills have deteriorated from freelancing in a vacuum. His best friend Stan works in online porn, toiling away in a virtual sweat-shop lorded over by a maniacal boss and his dog-like cronies. When Stan witnesses his life's work go up in flames late one night, he asks Rusty to join the company and help him uncover the truth behind his Kafkaesque employer.</p>
<p>These two web-lackeys soon discover a series of events have been set in motion so bizarre, that their world becomes engulfed by epic chaos. With the help of an alcoholic psychic and his fishing buddy, they're roped into a nightmarish struggle with bloodthirsty demons and money-mongering yes-men. Can they keep their jobs and their sanity intact when they can't trust anyone and there is an axe lurking behind every back?</p>
<p><em><strong>Chicken Outfit</strong> </em>is a sci-fi / horror comic for future-shocked times. It chronicles corporate greed, maniacal butchers, undead biker-chicks, drunken psychic shaman, pretentious aliens and a couple of under-paid slobs who find themselves in the most hellish situation of their lives.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px;"">WARNING! ADULTS ONLY (18+)</p>
<p>Although there is no explicit sex in this comic, there are scenes of violence so ridiculous, we need to state that this comic is unequivocally for ADULTS ONLY (18+)</p>
<p>People who have been tested with an advanced reading of Chicken Outfit have been known to faint, projectile vomit and bleed from various orifices we'd rather not mention here.</p>
<p>If you experience any of these symptoms while reading Chicken Outfit, please repeat to yourself, IT'S ONLY A COMIC... IT'S ONLY A COMIC... IT'S ONLY A COMIC...</p>

Just posted some character bios on the Chicken Outfit site. You can read more about Headcast, Zigmund Danzig, Stan Munson, and Rusty McDoodle. More to come. Check 'em out here: http://chickenoutfit.com/category/characters


We were recently interview by Inkd, the creators of a new webcomic reader app. We partnered with Inkd to help them launch their app. They call Chicken Outfit, ""...certainly one of the more unique and hilarious storyline's we've come across in Webcomics overall."" Check out the interview here: http://inkd.me/blog/2013/1/23/author-feature-joe-deagnon-creator-of-chicken-outfit.html


25 days left for ChickenOutfit Issue #1! Help us get us to $1000 by Jan 28 & all our IndieGoGo’ers who contribute at the $10 and up perk levels get a FREE unpublished digital PDF 18 pager from the Paranoid Tales archive!


Due to a massive hard-drive failure a day ago, I managed to lose two finished inked panels & the “Suspiria” postcard file. Luckily we had already sent the postcards to the printer and we now have them in hand! It’s now a limited edition card! Yay! I mean… ugh.


The postcards are being printed - we ended up going with a larger size than a normal postcard. They will be 216mm x 139mm (which is about 5.5 inches x  8.5 inches) which means they are more like mini-posters than postcards!
 

Here is another full colour page from the comic. Enjoy!
 

Just finished the last design for the six postcards included in the Chicken Strips perk level. Four of the postcards are parodies of some of my favourite films and some of the influences behind Chicken Outfit. Videodrome, Maniac, Suspiria and Dawn of the Dead. The last two postcards are the cover of the first issue and the alt. cover. You can see all the postcards below.

 

A big thank you to everyone who has contributed so far.  I am really looking forward to having you all read the comic.  Please make sure you use the sharing tools to let your friends know about Chicken Outfit and help us reach our funding goal!
I have just finished inking page 19 of the comic and have finished colouring the first 10 pages. We are on target for a March completion.
 

Chicken Outfit - The Hellish First Issue
Rusty McDoodle isn't having the best week. His web clients aren’t paying, his girlfriend left him and his social skills have deteriorated from freelancing in a vacuum. His best friend Stan works in online porn, toiling away in a virtual sweat-shop lorded over by a maniacal boss and his dog-like cronies. When Stan witnesses his life's work go up in flames late one night, he asks Rusty to join the company and help him uncover the truth behind his Kafkaesque employer.
These two web-lackeys soon discover a series of events have been set in motion so bizarre, that their world becomes engulfed by epic chaos. With the help of an alcoholic psychic and his fishing buddy, they're roped into a nightmarish struggle with bloodthirsty demons and money-mongering yes-men. Can they keep their jobs and their sanity intact when they can't trust anyone and there is an axe lurking behind every back?
Chicken Outfit is a sci-fi / horror comic for future-shocked times. It chronicles corporate greed, maniacal butchers, undead biker-chicks, drunken psychic shaman, pretentious aliens and a couple of under-paid slobs who find themselves in the most hellish situation of their lives.
WARNING! ADULTS ONLY (18+)
Although there is no explicit sex in this comic, there are scenes of violence so ridiculous, we need to state that this comic is unequivocally for ADULTS ONLY (18+)
People who have been tested with an advanced reading of Chicken Outfit have been known to faint, projectile vomit and bleed from various orifices we'd rather not mention here.
If you experience any of these symptoms while reading Chicken Outfit, please repeat to yourself, IT'S ONLY A COMIC... IT'S ONLY A COMIC... IT'S ONLY A COMIC...
 

 
Why we are raising funds:
We are raising money to print the comic in brain-melting full colour and get it into the hands of anyone who loves comics, sci-fi and horror, and wants to read something fresh, original and inventive.
Some of the money will go to pay for the postcards, t-shirts and other rewards made available exclusively to indiegogo contributors.
This is the first issue in what will be an ongoing series and you can get in on the ground floor and help ensure the success of what is certain to be a cult smash.
Once printed, the comic (and all the swag) will be sent to our Indiegogo supporters first, before anyone else can get their meat hooks all over it.

<p><b>All of the funds will go towards the graphic novel's production</b>, the artwork, writing, lettering, colouring, printing, marketing and distribution. Anything you can offer will help. In return we will offer our deepest gratitude in all kinds of unique perks. Please see the perk bar for details. *Please note: Travel and accommodation expenses are not included and postage outside of the USA must be added if you are claiming a perk that requires postage.</p>
<p><b>What's in a name?</b> There's a very interesting fact about the hero, did you know that there's at least seven different spellings of his name? This has come about over thousands of years, the stories became legends, the legends became myths. Here's the names we know of: Finn McCool ... Fionn Mac Cum Hail ... Finn McCuail ... Fionn McCumhail ... Fyn Mc Cuail ... Fionn McCual ... Finn McCuail. Some say that his name is spelt ""Fionn"" but that would make it the modern spelling, others say ""Finn"" the old way. So, what we decided to do was to offer the hero's name so that EVERYBODY can read and pronounce it, an inclusive spelling, hence ... ""Finn McCool"". Now, for all of the die-hard Gaelic fan's of the hero, we will also be producing a limited edition version, with all of the names, and there are many, spelt in the ancient Irish Gaelic. If that's the copy you'd like, then please just email and let us know. You can do so via this page when you preorder your copy of the graphic novel. </p>
<p>What happens if we don't reach our total goal? We will continue the project come what may by STARTING, we can still hire the artists and even begin by creating a soft copy of the stories. We want to invite you to become involved, you are our community, our tribe, we believe that you should have the chance to be a part of this exciting reemergence of the Wild Celt. We'll achieve this through the stories of Finn McCool, and the Fianna.  Finn would have wanted it that way. Real People. Real Project. Real Heart.</p>

Please see the perk bar for details. *Please note: Travel and accommodation expenses are not included and postage outside of the USA must be added if you are claiming a perk that requires postage.
What's in a name? There's a very interesting fact about the hero, did you know that there's at least seven different spellings of his name? This has come about over thousands of years, the stories became legends, the legends became myths. Here's the names we know of: Finn McCool ... Fionn Mac Cum Hail ... Finn McCuail ... Fionn McCumhail ... Fyn Mc Cuail ... Fionn McCual ... Finn McCuail. Some say that his name is spelt ""Fionn"" but that would make it the modern spelling, others say ""Finn"" the old way. So, what we decided to do was to offer the hero's name so that EVERYBODY can read and pronounce it, an inclusive spelling, hence ... ""Finn McCool"". Now, for all of the die-hard Gaelic fan's of the hero, we will also be producing a limited edition version, with all of the names, and there are many, spelt in the ancient Irish Gaelic. If that's the copy you'd like, then please just email and let us know. You can do so via this page when you preorder your copy of the graphic novel. 
What happens if we don't reach our total goal? We will continue the project come what may by STARTING, we can still hire the artists and even begin by creating a soft copy of the stories. We want to invite you to become involved, you are our community, our tribe, we believe that you should have the chance to be a part of this exciting reemergence of the Wild Celt. We'll achieve this through the stories of Finn McCool, and the Fianna.  Finn would have wanted it that way. Real People. Real Project. Real Heart.
                                  An old Irish saying goes:



So, com'on, let's you and I dream the Heroes alive, let's breathe anew the old, give fire to the wind, and call the gods to task. Our time is Now, we honour our past by becoming the hero, by becoming the Hero, we live the myths...

Chris Brosnan is the Writer/Producer of the Finn McCool project. Born in the UK where he lived for 40 years, he now lives in Vancouver, Canada with his wife, Karen  and their 4 year old son Fionn.
Chris' background is in Film and T.V. production in the UK, as well as writing and performing for the music and stage industry, not only in the UK, but around the world. This has been his passion for over 25 years. Below is a shot of Chris with his son, Fionn, named after the legendary Irish hero Finn McCool ...



Chris' writing credits include: ""Fugitive Fathers"", ""Wimps To Warriors"", ""The Shadow Catcher"", ""Healers"", ""Gospel According to Elvis"", ""The Redemption of Man"" and ""Finn McCool - The Forging of the Fianna."" Graphic novel and the feature film screenplay of the same.
""I was first introduced to the legends of Finn McCool from my Grandmother and later from traditional storytellers. His legend has fascinated, not only me, but the people of Ireland and scholars alike the world over for centuries."" 
Chris started his film career working alongside the likes of Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, Kevin Costner and Morgan Freeman, in big budget feature films, learning from the best in movies such as: ""Willow"", ""Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves"", ""White Hunter- Black Heart"", ""Batman"", and many, many more.
Although Chris started his career as an actor, he found that he preferred the other side of the camera. He became a writer/producer for stage in the early nineties and has also worked on productions for the BBC as well as many Independents.
The natural progression into producing is something Chris is very focussed on, and his passion and energy is on breathing life into this exiting new project.
Chris brings a wealth of experience in the industry, and an extensive book of contacts to the Finn McCool project.

<h3>La Storia</h3>
<p>Un anno fa, in <strong>""Brothel Bros""</strong>, i 10 peggiori pervertiti della città scoprirono che il loro bordello preferito era in realtà gestito da demoni. <i>Il Direttore</i>, capo dei demoni, scagliò su di loro una maledizione che li avrebbe uccisi se avessero rivelato a qualcuno la loro scoperta. Passarono una notte letteralmente infernale e alcuni di loro, collaborando (più o meno), sono riusciti a sopravvivere. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/BrothelBros/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=965839716782394"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">[Leggi le anteprime su facebook.]</a></p>
<p>Ma ora, in <strong>""Brothel Bros 2 - Piano B""</strong>, la pace che ottennero combattendo è minacciata. Quando si riuniscono tutti per una cerimonia nuziale, alcuni imbucati davvero <i>diabolici </i>rovinano tutto orribilmente spedendo metà dei partecipanti del matrimonio in un altro piano dimensionale. Nel cercare di riportare ognuno alla propria realtà di appartenenza scopriranno che qualcosa di molto più grosso sta per succedere... <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/BrothelBros/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1947402221959467"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">[Leggi le anteprime su facebook.]</a></p>
<h3>Il Progetto</h3>
<p><strong>Brothel Bros</strong> è una commedia thriller che usa la sua folle e assurda premessa per raccontare una storia divertente e adrenalinica, ma anche per toccare alcuni temi più profondi e psicologici come i feticci sessuali e la pedofilia in maniera diretta e onesta. Il primo volume è stato ricevuto positivamente in Italia ed ha anche ricevuto due premi all'<i>Italian Indie Comics Award</i> nel 2016. <strong>Brothel Bros 2</strong> prosegue nelle stesse orme avendo una storia ancor più avventurosa e tuffandosi ancora più in profondità nelle menti dei personaggi. <i>Brothel Bros</i> ha in passato portato le persone a discutere dei sé stessi interiori e desidera farlo ancora, perché raccontare storie avvincenti che ti rimangano addosso è la cosa migliore che possiamo ambire a fare.</p>

<p>... o nel peggiore dei casi possiamo fingere di averne. Ecco le risposte ad alcune domande che potresti avere. Se la tua domanda non è elencata qui, congratulazioni, sei speciale (in senso buono, si spera) e puoi contattarci cliccando su<i> ""Ask a question""</i> in alto a destra nella pagina accanto alla faccia diabolicamente sexy di David!</p>
<h3>I fumetti sono in Inglese o in Italiano?</h3>
<p>Entrambi! Quando richiedi un perk, ti verrà chiesto di scegliere in quale lingua vuoi che sia il fumetto, e questo vale sia per <i>Brothel Bros 1</i> che per <i>Brothel Bros 2</i>, sia per l'edizione cartacea che per quella digitale. Per il <i>Brothel Bros Backstage Book </i>non ti verrà chiesto di scegliere, perché ogni copia è bilingue (ha entrambe le lingue).</p>
<h3>E se io non avessi letto Brothel Bros 1?</h3>
<p>Non preoccuparti! Ti suggeriamo di prendere il perk <strong>""Both Books""</strong> o il perk<strong> ""Digital Duo""</strong> così da avere sia BB1 che BB2! Ma se intendevi prendere alcuni dei prodotti esclusivi del crowfunding, o se intendevi prendere solo il primo libro (Puoi farlo! Tecnicamente BB1 è una storia completa, quindi puoi anche leggere solo quello!) allora <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/brothel-bros-2-piano-b-fantasy-horror/x/14298587#/updates/5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">clicca qui</a>.</p>
<p>Nota: i perk con ""Add-On"" nel nome non possono essere richiesti da soli e non se ne può richiedere più di uno per una singola spedizione.</p>
<h3>Posso ritirare di persona il perk e non pagare la spedizione?</h3>
<p>Se hai richiesto il perk <strong>""Brothel Bros 2 - in fiera""</strong> ritirerai il perk a <i>Lucca Comics and Games 2018</i> (ti verranno forniti informazioni e aggiornamenti via e-mail). Se hai richiesto un qualsiasi altro perk e vuoi ritirarlo di persona ti chiediamo di pagare comunque la spedizione (per l'Italia parte da soli 2€), ma di contattarci subito dopo. Se riusciremo, ti daremo il perk di persona (e potresti ottenere qualcosa in più gratuitamente per ricompensarti del disturbo) altrimenti ti avvertiremo per tempo e procederemo comunque con la spedizione.</p>
<h3>Che tipo di spedizione è prevista?</h3>
<p>Se richiedi un perk che necessita di spedizione, ti verrà chiesto di fornire un indirizzo e ti verrà aggiunto un costo di spedizione dipendente dalla nazione destinataria. Il tuo ordine verrà spedito tramite Poste Italiane usando un pacco normale non tracciabile e non raccomandato (per tenere bassi i costi di spedizione). Per le spedizioni in Italia, per i perk contenenti T-Shirt sarà un ""Pacco Ordinario"", per tutti gli altri sarà un ""Piego di Libri"". Se vuoi una <strong>Spedizione Raccomandata</strong> (che richiederà la tua firma per essere consegnata) <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/brothel-bros-2-piano-b-fantasy-horror/x/14298587#/updates/4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">clicca qui</a> o contattaci cliccando su <i>""Ask a question""</i>  in alto a destra nella pagina, accanto alla faccia straordinariamente seducente di David!</p>
<p>Nota: i perk i cui nomi contengolo la parola ""Extra"" non possono essere richiesti da soli e non se ne può richiedere più di uno per una singola spedizione. Indipendentemente dal tipo di spedizione che scegli, noi non saremo responsabili del tuo pacco qualora questo andasse danneggiato o perso durante la spedizione.</p>
<h3>In quali taglie e colori sono disponibili le T-Shirt?</h3>
<p>Le T-Shirt saranno disponibili in Nero, Grigio, e Bianco, quindi avranno un aspetto simile a questo:</p>

<p>E per sapere quant'è piccola una S, quant'è larga una L, e quant'è... media una M, dai un'occhiata a questa utile tabella! Ti suggeriamo di misurare una maglietta che ti sta comoda e di prendere la taglia che ci si avvicina di più.</p>

<h3>Avete una macchina del tempo?</h3>
<p>Sfortunatamente no, ma se vi riferite al perk ""PROMO PACK"" che indica come data di spedizione del perk ""novembre 2011"", beh... è un errore. E se l'avete ordinato dovreste saperlo. Dovreste saperlo da quasi 7 anni!</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>A year ago, in <strong>“Brothel Bros”</strong>, the city's 10 worst perverts found out their favourite brothel was actually run by demons. <i>The Administrator</i>, chief of the demons, cast a curse on them, so that if they told someone about their discovery, they'd die. They quite literally had a hell of a night and some of them managed to somewhat cooperate and live to tell the tale (which they didn't, for obvious reasons). [Read the Preview on <a href=""https://tapas.io/series/BrothelBros"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Tapas</a>, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/BrothelBros/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1873572122675811"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Facebook</a>, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/brothelbros/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Instagram</a>, or <a href=""https://brothelbros.tumblr.com/archive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">Tumblr</a>.]<br/>But now, in<strong> “Brothel Bros 2 – Plan B”</strong>, the peace they fought to defend is threatened. When they all reunite for a wedding ceremony, some really <i>devilish</i> wedding crashers make everything go horribly wrong by sending half of the ceremony guests into another dimensional plane. As they try to get everyone back to their own reality they'll find out there's something way bigger going on...</p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><strong>Brothel Bros</strong> is a comedic thriller comic that uses its wacky absurd premise to tell a funny adrenaline-fueled story, but also to touch upon some deeper psychological topics such as sexual kinks and paedophilia in a bluntly honest way. The first book was positively recieved in Italy and also won two awards at the<i> Italian Indie Comics Award </i>in 2016. <strong>Brothel Bros 2</strong> follows in the same footsteps by having an even more adventurous story and delving even deeper into the characters' minds. Brothel Bros has brought people to discuss their inner selves in the past and desires to do it again, because telling compelling stories that stick with you is the best thing we can aim to do.</p>

<p>... or at least we'll pretend we do. Here are the answers to some questions you might have. If your question is not listed here, congratulations, you are special (in a good way, we hope) and you can contact us by clicking on <i>""Ask a question""</i> on the top right of the page, next to David's devilishly sexy face!</p>
<h3>Are the comics in English or in Italian?</h3>
<p>Both! When you claim a perk, you'll be asked to choose what language you want the comic to be in, this goes for both <i>Brothel Bros 1</i> and <i>Brothel Bros 2</i>, both paperback and digital. For the <i>Brothel Bros Backstage Book </i>you won't be asked to choose, as every copy of it is bilingual (with both languages).</p>
<h3>What if I haven't read Brothel Bros 1?</h3>
<p>No worries! We suggest getting the perks<strong> ""Both Books""</strong> or <strong>""Digital Duo""</strong> so that you'll have both BB1 and BB2! But if you wanted to get some of the crowdfunding exclusive items too, or if you wanted to get just the first book (You can do that! Technically BB1 is a complete story, so you can read it on it's own!) then <strong><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/brothel-bros-2-piano-b-fantasy-horror/x/14298587#/updates/1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">click here.</a></strong></p>
<p>Note: perks with ""Add-On"" in their name can't be claimed singularly and you can't claim more than one of them in the same shipping.</p>
<h3>Can I collect my perk in person, and not pay for shipping?</h3>
<p>If you claimed the perk <strong>""Brothel Bros 2 - in fiera""</strong> you will collect your perk at <i>Lucca Comics and Games 2018</i> (instructions and updates will be provided to you via e-mail). If you claimed any other perk and want to collect it in person, we ask you to still pay for shipping, but to contact us afterwards. If we'll be able to, we'll give you the perk in person (and you might get something extra for your trouble) otherwise we'll tell you so beforehand and we'll ship the perk.</p>
<h3>What kind of shipping do I get?</h3>
<p>If you claim a perk that requires shipping, you'll be asked to fill out your address and a shipping fee will be added depending on the country you're ordering from. Your order will be sent via <i>Poste Italiane</i> (Italy's mail service) using <strong>regular non-trackable unregistered packages</strong> (to keep your shipping fees low). If you want to get <strong>Registered Shipping</strong> (which will require your signature to be delivered) <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/brothel-bros-2-piano-b-fantasy-horror/x/14298587#/updates/3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a> or contact us by clicking on ""Ask a question"" on the top right of the page, next to David's amazingly seductive face!</p>
<p>Note: perks with ""Extra"" in their name can't be claimed singularly and you can't claim more than one of them in the same shipping. Regardless of the shipping option you choose, we will not be responsible for your package being lost or damaged during shipping,</p>
<h3>What are the T-Shirts sizes and colors?</h3>
<p>The Shirts come in Black, Grey (Charcoal), and White, so they'll look something like this:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525120435/pqpaesqymlt7s4t8a7z3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And to know how small a small is, how large a large is, and how... medium a medium is, check out this helpful chart! We suggest you measure a T-Shirt you are comfortable in, and then get the closest size.</p>

<h3>Do you have a freaking time machine?</h3>
<p>Unfortunatley not, but if you're refering to the ""PROMO PACK"" perk showing ""november 2011"" as a shipping estimated time, wel... it's a typo. And you should know that, if you ordered it. You should've known that for almost 7 years!</p>

La Storia
Un anno fa, in ""Brothel Bros"", i 10 peggiori pervertiti della città scoprirono che il loro bordello preferito era in realtà gestito da demoni. Il Direttore, capo dei demoni, scagliò su di loro una maledizione che li avrebbe uccisi se avessero rivelato a qualcuno la loro scoperta. Passarono una notte letteralmente infernale e alcuni di loro, collaborando (più o meno), sono riusciti a sopravvivere. [Leggi le anteprime su facebook.]
Ma ora, in ""Brothel Bros 2 - Piano B"", la pace che ottennero combattendo è minacciata. Quando si riuniscono tutti per una cerimonia nuziale, alcuni imbucati davvero diabolici rovinano tutto orribilmente spedendo metà dei partecipanti del matrimonio in un altro piano dimensionale. Nel cercare di riportare ognuno alla propria realtà di appartenenza scopriranno che qualcosa di molto più grosso sta per succedere... [Leggi le anteprime su facebook.]
Il Progetto
Brothel Bros è una commedia thriller che usa la sua folle e assurda premessa per raccontare una storia divertente e adrenalinica, ma anche per toccare alcuni temi più profondi e psicologici come i feticci sessuali e la pedofilia in maniera diretta e onesta. Il primo volume è stato ricevuto positivamente in Italia ed ha anche ricevuto due premi all'Italian Indie Comics Award nel 2016. Brothel Bros 2 prosegue nelle stesse orme avendo una storia ancor più avventurosa e tuffandosi ancora più in profondità nelle menti dei personaggi. Brothel Bros ha in passato portato le persone a discutere dei sé stessi interiori e desidera farlo ancora, perché raccontare storie avvincenti che ti rimangano addosso è la cosa migliore che possiamo ambire a fare.
La squadra di BB2

David Malan è lo sceneggiatore e ha creato Brothel Bros assieme a Sara Antonellini che ricopre anche i ruoli di editor e colorista, e come aiuto colorista c'è Giulia D'Urso. Ai disegni ci sono Beatrice Bovo, Silvia Belli, Lisa Picchietti, Connie Daidone, e Giulia Lomurno. A disegnare e colorare le proprie tavole ci sono Stefano Martinuz e Milena Ciccarello. A realizzare la copertina c'è Elisa Serio. A realizzare i design delle T-Shirt e i Mini-Poster e ad aver disegnato nel primo volume c'è Eleonora Bruni.
Brothel Bros e Brothel Bros 2 sono fumetti indipendenti autoprodotti distribuiti alle fiere del fumetto in Italia dal gruppo no-profit ""Potpourri Comics"". Col tuo aiuto saremo in grado di completare BB2 e tradurre e stampare in inglese entrambi i fumetti (BB1 è stato già tradotto, BB2 lo sarà presto).Lavori in corsoBrothel Bros 1 è completamente finito ed è tradotto in ingese per circa il 65%, ma la traduzione riprenderà non appena finirà questa campagna (richiede fatica, sai?). Brothel Bros 2 è completamente sceneggiato ed è disegnato per circa il 50%, ma il lavoro procede speditamente e siamo tutti professionisti che hanno lavorato a progetti simili in passato. Perciò amenoché dei demoni non emergano dal terreno per portarci nel loro piano dimensionale (il che, è vero, Brothel Bros implica che sia più probabile di quel che sembra), finiremo il nuovo volume entro le scadenze che ci siamo severamente imposti, e tutti i perk verranno spediti.I ProdottiC'è un sacco di roba figa qui, e gran parte è un'esclusiva del crowdfunding e/o è nuova.
Brothel Bros 1 è la versione cartacea, e la sua versione in inglese è nuova. Scopri come ottenere questo prodotto cliccando qui.

Beh, ecco qua! Aiutaci a raggiungere lo Stetch Goal a l'avrai!Caccia i soldiI fondi raccolti in questa campagna saranno usati per pagare la stampa e la spedizione dei prodotti e il restante è destinato agli artisti i cui meravigliosi talenti hanno forgiato questo magnifico libro. David e Sara, i creatori e sviluppatori di Brothel Bros, hanno deciso di non ricevere alcuna percentuale da ciò che verrà raccolto qui, per permettere invece al resto del team creativo di cominciare a guadagnare prima di loro. Perché ti diciamo questo? Non sono affari loro cosa decidono di fare? Beh, più o meno. Vogliamo che tu sappia che il tuo contributo andrà tanto direttamente quanto possibile nelle mani che hanno realizzato le tavole che stai ammirando, perché un lavoro ben fatto va pagato, perdindirindina! (E perché anche gli artisti devono mangiare!)Quindi, secondo i nostri calcoli, questo è all'incirca come verranno impiegati i fondi:

10% Tariffa Indiegogo e tasse

50% Stampa e spedizione prodotti

40% Team creativo
Speriamo davvero di sì, ma questo non significa necessariamente che tu te lo possa permettere. Abbiamo reso i fumetti disponibili anche in forma digitale, come alternativa più ecologica e più economica, ma se anche questo fosse fuori portata per te, puoi sempre aiutarci condividendo questa campagna con gente che pensi possa essere interessata! Vogliamo portare Brothel Bros al mondo intero, ma le nostre braccia non sono abbastanza lunghe, né i nostri polmoni sono abbastanza potenti, quindi più siamo, meglio è!

... o nel peggiore dei casi possiamo fingere di averne. Ecco le risposte ad alcune domande che potresti avere. Se la tua domanda non è elencata qui, congratulazioni, sei speciale (in senso buono, si spera) e puoi contattarci cliccando su ""Ask a question"" in alto a destra nella pagina accanto alla faccia diabolicamente sexy di David!
I fumetti sono in Inglese o in Italiano?
Entrambi! Quando richiedi un perk, ti verrà chiesto di scegliere in quale lingua vuoi che sia il fumetto, e questo vale sia per Brothel Bros 1 che per Brothel Bros 2, sia per l'edizione cartacea che per quella digitale. Per il Brothel Bros Backstage Book non ti verrà chiesto di scegliere, perché ogni copia è bilingue (ha entrambe le lingue).
E se io non avessi letto Brothel Bros 1?
Non preoccuparti! Ti suggeriamo di prendere il perk ""Both Books"" o il perk ""Digital Duo"" così da avere sia BB1 che BB2! Ma se intendevi prendere alcuni dei prodotti esclusivi del crowfunding, o se intendevi prendere solo il primo libro (Puoi farlo! Tecnicamente BB1 è una storia completa, quindi puoi anche leggere solo quello!) allora clicca qui.
Nota: i perk con ""Add-On"" nel nome non possono essere richiesti da soli e non se ne può richiedere più di uno per una singola spedizione.
Posso ritirare di persona il perk e non pagare la spedizione?
Se hai richiesto il perk ""Brothel Bros 2 - in fiera"" ritirerai il perk a Lucca Comics and Games 2018 (ti verranno forniti informazioni e aggiornamenti via e-mail). Se hai richiesto un qualsiasi altro perk e vuoi ritirarlo di persona ti chiediamo di pagare comunque la spedizione (per l'Italia parte da soli 2€), ma di contattarci subito dopo. Se riusciremo, ti daremo il perk di persona (e potresti ottenere qualcosa in più gratuitamente per ricompensarti del disturbo) altrimenti ti avvertiremo per tempo e procederemo comunque con la spedizione.
Che tipo di spedizione è prevista?
Se richiedi un perk che necessita di spedizione, ti verrà chiesto di fornire un indirizzo e ti verrà aggiunto un costo di spedizione dipendente dalla nazione destinataria. Il tuo ordine verrà spedito tramite Poste Italiane usando un pacco normale non tracciabile e non raccomandato (per tenere bassi i costi di spedizione). Per le spedizioni in Italia, per i perk contenenti T-Shirt sarà un ""Pacco Ordinario"", per tutti gli altri sarà un ""Piego di Libri"". Se vuoi una Spedizione Raccomandata (che richiederà la tua firma per essere consegnata) clicca qui o contattaci cliccando su ""Ask a question""  in alto a destra nella pagina, accanto alla faccia straordinariamente seducente di David!
Nota: i perk i cui nomi contengolo la parola ""Extra"" non possono essere richiesti da soli e non se ne può richiedere più di uno per una singola spedizione. Indipendentemente dal tipo di spedizione che scegli, noi non saremo responsabili del tuo pacco qualora questo andasse danneggiato o perso durante la spedizione.
In quali taglie e colori sono disponibili le T-Shirt?
Le T-Shirt saranno disponibili in Nero, Grigio, e Bianco, quindi avranno un aspetto simile a questo:

E per sapere quant'è piccola una S, quant'è larga una L, e quant'è... media una M, dai un'occhiata a questa utile tabella! Ti suggeriamo di misurare una maglietta che ti sta comoda e di prendere la taglia che ci si avvicina di più.

Avete una macchina del tempo?
Sfortunatamente no, ma se vi riferite al perk ""PROMO PACK"" che indica come data di spedizione del perk ""novembre 2011"", beh... è un errore. E se l'avete ordinato dovreste saperlo. Dovreste saperlo da quasi 7 anni!

The Story
A year ago, in “Brothel Bros”, the city's 10 worst perverts found out their favourite brothel was actually run by demons. The Administrator, chief of the demons, cast a curse on them, so that if they told someone about their discovery, they'd die. They quite literally had a hell of a night and some of them managed to somewhat cooperate and live to tell the tale (which they didn't, for obvious reasons). [Read the Preview on Tapas, Facebook, Instagram, or Tumblr.]But now, in “Brothel Bros 2 – Plan B”, the peace they fought to defend is threatened. When they all reunite for a wedding ceremony, some really devilish wedding crashers make everything go horribly wrong by sending half of the ceremony guests into another dimensional plane. As they try to get everyone back to their own reality they'll find out there's something way bigger going on...
The Project
Brothel Bros is a comedic thriller comic that uses its wacky absurd premise to tell a funny adrenaline-fueled story, but also to touch upon some deeper psychological topics such as sexual kinks and paedophilia in a bluntly honest way. The first book was positively recieved in Italy and also won two awards at the Italian Indie Comics Award in 2016. Brothel Bros 2 follows in the same footsteps by having an even more adventurous story and delving even deeper into the characters' minds. Brothel Bros has brought people to discuss their inner selves in the past and desires to do it again, because telling compelling stories that stick with you is the best thing we can aim to do.
The BB2 Team

David Malan is the writer and he created Brothel Bros together with Sara Antonellini who also fills the roles of editor and colorist, and as a colorist aide there's Giulia D'Urso. Beatrice Bovo, Silvia Belli, Lisa Picchietti, Connie Daidone, and Giulia Lomurno are in charge of the drawings. Stefano Martinuz and Milena Ciccarello draw and color their own pages. Elisa Serio is in charge of the cover. And in addition to drawing part of BB1, Eleonora Bruni is in charge of the T-Shirts and Mini-Posters designs.
Brothel Bros and Brothel Bros 2 are self-published indie comics distributed in Italian comicbook conventions with the help of non-profit group ""Potpourri Comics"". With your help we'll be able to complete BB2 and to translate and print both comics in english (BB1 has been translated, BB2 will be shortly).Work in progessBrothel Bros 1 is completely finished and about 65% translated into English, but translating will resume as soon as this campaign is over (it's quite tolling, y'know?). Brothel Bros 2 is completely written and about 50% drawn, but work is proceding steadily and all of us are professionals and worked on similar projects before. So unless demons sprout out of the ground and take us to their dimensional plane (which, granted, Brothel Bros implies it's more likely than it sounds), we will finish the new book within the deadlines we very strictly wrote for ourselves, and all the perks will be then shipped.The ItemsThere's lots of awesome stuff here, and most of it is a crowdfunding exclusive and/or new.
Brothel Bros 1 is the paperback edition and its English version is new. Find out how to get this item by clicking here.

Brothel Bros 2 is the paperback edition and is the comic we're working on right now, so it's extra new!
Mini Poster - Team Ludo/Team Iancu is a small postcard-like poster with a Team Ludo design on one side and a Team Iancu design on the other. It's a crowdfunding exclusive and will be given free with every paperback copy of Brothel Bros 2  as a special thank you to the contributors!

Brothel Bros 1 - File PDF is the digital edition of Brothel Bros 1 and is a crowdfunding exclusive. It contains everything made available in the paperback edition.

Brothel Bros 2 - File PDF is the digital edition of Brothel Bros 2 and is a crowdfunding exclusive. It contains everything made available in the paperback edition.

Brothel Bros Backstage Book is a crowdfunding exclusive booklet containing sketches and character studies from the artists. It also contains some trivia about the creative process and some behind-the-scenes information about the story and characters of Brothel Bros.


Commissione Personalizzata grants you a custom made commission from one of the artists. You get to choose two Brothel Bros characters and the artist you chose will draw them in a full color digital picture just for you!

Brothel Bros 2 T-Shirt is a crowdfunding exclusive T-Shirt with either a Team Iancu or a Team Ludo design on it, your choice! You'll also get to choose its size and color.

[NEW] BodyPillow-Case it's a crowdfunding exclusive and it's a  Dakimakura pillowcase (measuring around 50x150cm). You can choose 2 of the 6 available designs to use as the front and the back of the pillow-case, so you may choose who you'd rather sleep with: Iancu, Shabriri, or Buck.
[NEW] BodyPillow is the pillow you can use the BodyPillow-Case with.Stretch Goals[NEW] We can now announce our stretch goal! If we reach 3500€ all the backers who bought physical Perks will get a Brothel Bros Custom Condom!!! You wanna have a special condom for a special someone? Well, here ya go! Help us reach the Stretch Goal and you'll have it!Show me the moneyThe funds raised in this campaign will be used to pay the printing and shipping of the items and the rest is set to go to the artists whose amazing talents forged this magnificent book. David and Sara, the creators and developers of Brothel Bros, decided not to get a cut of what will be raised here, to instead allow the rest of the creative team to start earning before them. Why do we tell you this? Isn't it their own business what they decide to do? Well, sorta. We want you to know that your contribution will go as directly as possible to pay the hands that made the art that you're seeing, because a good job deserves to be paid, gosh darn it! (And because artists need to eat too!)So, according to our calculations this should approximately be how the funds will be employed:

10% Indiegogo fee and taxes

50% Perks printing and shipping costs

40% Creative team
We really hope you do, but that doesn't necessarily mean you can afford it. We made the comics available in digital form too, as a greener and cheaper alternative, but if that's still too much for you, you can still help us out by sharing this campaign with people who you think might be interested! We want to bring Brothel Bros to the world, but our arms aren't that long and our lungs aren't that powerful, so the more we are spreading the word, the better!

... or at least we'll pretend we do. Here are the answers to some questions you might have. If your question is not listed here, congratulations, you are special (in a good way, we hope) and you can contact us by clicking on ""Ask a question"" on the top right of the page, next to David's devilishly sexy face!
Are the comics in English or in Italian?
Both! When you claim a perk, you'll be asked to choose what language you want the comic to be in, this goes for both Brothel Bros 1 and Brothel Bros 2, both paperback and digital. For the Brothel Bros Backstage Book you won't be asked to choose, as every copy of it is bilingual (with both languages).
What if I haven't read Brothel Bros 1?
No worries! We suggest getting the perks ""Both Books"" or ""Digital Duo"" so that you'll have both BB1 and BB2! But if you wanted to get some of the crowdfunding exclusive items too, or if you wanted to get just the first book (You can do that! Technically BB1 is a complete story, so you can read it on it's own!) then click here.
Note: perks with ""Add-On"" in their name can't be claimed singularly and you can't claim more than one of them in the same shipping.
Can I collect my perk in person, and not pay for shipping?
If you claimed the perk ""Brothel Bros 2 - in fiera"" you will collect your perk at Lucca Comics and Games 2018 (instructions and updates will be provided to you via e-mail). If you claimed any other perk and want to collect it in person, we ask you to still pay for shipping, but to contact us afterwards. If we'll be able to, we'll give you the perk in person (and you might get something extra for your trouble) otherwise we'll tell you so beforehand and we'll ship the perk.
What kind of shipping do I get?
If you claim a perk that requires shipping, you'll be asked to fill out your address and a shipping fee will be added depending on the country you're ordering from. Your order will be sent via Poste Italiane (Italy's mail service) using regular non-trackable unregistered packages (to keep your shipping fees low). If you want to get Registered Shipping (which will require your signature to be delivered) click here or contact us by clicking on ""Ask a question"" on the top right of the page, next to David's amazingly seductive face!
Note: perks with ""Extra"" in their name can't be claimed singularly and you can't claim more than one of them in the same shipping. Regardless of the shipping option you choose, we will not be responsible for your package being lost or damaged during shipping,
What are the T-Shirts sizes and colors?
The Shirts come in Black, Grey (Charcoal), and White, so they'll look something like this:

And to know how small a small is, how large a large is, and how... medium a medium is, check out this helpful chart! We suggest you measure a T-Shirt you are comfortable in, and then get the closest size.

Do you have a freaking time machine?
Unfortunatley not, but if you're refering to the ""PROMO PACK"" perk showing ""november 2011"" as a shipping estimated time, wel... it's a typo. And you should know that, if you ordered it. You should've known that for almost 7 years!

<h3>The Frankenstein Zombie</h3>
<p>Monday July 24</p>
<p>Welcome back, Frank-Fans! Sorry for the late posting. I got back to the East Coast from Comic-Con late Monday night and my system just crashed. So this is going to be a quick one as I post the last preview images for the Frankenstein Zombie. I will be back soon with more news. Hope you all had a great weekend!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500975717/otkqhl5iq2l04r1hgcso.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500975771/wcqzzf8sguys85xakzgz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500975828/nkkkcn3iphmc0lzqfrjx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500975893/i09jrkwxldt5mfn5ljcx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Monday July 17th</p>
<p>Hey, Fear-Fans! It's been an emotional rollercoaster with the death of horror legend George Romero over the weekend. The Master is gone, but his influence will live on. </p>
<p>And since it's not only Monday, but Monday before Comiccon, let's get to the business of this weeks preview pages. Although, there's more than just interior pages to post as the final version of the cover has just been colored by the uber-talented Arsia Rozegar! Wanted to have this ready for the campaign launch, but here it is in all it's glory. </p>
<p>So, I've got a lot to do before I shuffle off to San Diego, so let's get to the preview!</p>

<h3>Monday, July 10th</h3>
<p>Okay, gang! I'm back! Still trying to work the indiegogo interface. Was hoping I could do updates like a blog. Anyway, I'm adding the campaign updates to the basic story here. As promised, for the next 3 Mondays (starting this Monday) I'll be posting preview pages of issue 1 of The Frankenstein Zombie. </p>
<p>Also! I updated our one-and-only perk to make it help make donating even more enticing.</p>
<p>And finally, I hope to have a little update on the cover next time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support and I hope you enjoy the preview!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Greetings! If you've watched my video, some of this will seem familiar, but here goes:  I'd like to talk to you about my new comic book horror series ""The Frankenstein Zombie."" Imagine the Monster of Frankenstein waking up in a world where he's no longer the scariest thing in the room. A world where Zombies overrun the countryside and the regular folk who would hunt him down with torch and pitchfork now have to beg for his aid. The Frankenstein Zombie, by its very nature, inspires one to new heights of horror, but it also presents an existential crisis as the Monster tries to define his place in this terrifying new world.</p>
<p>Yes, there will be humor. But humor to help alleviate the horror. This is not a spoof or satire . This is a genuine horror series and I really hope to make y'alls skin crawl as the story unfolds.</p>
<p>I'm very excited about this series and want to tell you all about it. And that's the hard part because if I try to tell you about all the good stuff in the series, I will spoil a lot of it.</p>
<p>Just believe me that this is not some arbitrary high-concept pitch. I have very specific reasons for everything in the book. From the locations, to the characters, to the exact dates used in the story. They are all there for a reason. I think the Monster of Frankenstein is one of the best  myth creations in literature and I hope you will support the Frankenstein Zombie.</p>
<h3>About Rewards</h3>
<p>As you may have heard in the video, I'm not doing a conventional rewards campaign. That's because it's my opinion that rewards are a mechanism to help finance the creation of the book. There's no need for that here. The first issue is completed and ready for the press. So I'm cutting out all the ""middlemen"", if you will, and getting to the meat of the matter. Like Mad Magazine of old, I'm trying to make this work on unit sales alone.</p>
<p>So, as you see, the price of the donation will get you The Frankenstein Zombie shipped to your door. The donation is $8. You may find that to be an odd number. But this amount will cover the costs of printing, packaging, and shipping. Also, indiegogo will take their piece of that sum. Sales tax will also come into it. As well as the vagaries of international shipping which I can't easily estimate. And there is one other thing most beginning publishers don't count on. A little thing I like to call ""hidden costs"". While I feel I have crunched all the numbers here, I have learned from experience to always bill in a little cushion for ""hidden costs"" that didn't come up during negotiations. I don't mind not making a huge profit on this, but I don't want to go into the hole either. Even at $8 I'm cutting it close. I would feel more comfortable pricing this book at $10 in the beginning, but I'm keeping the faith that I've estimated this correctly. After this first campaign is over and I know the true lay of the land, I hope I can adjust the price for issue 2.</p>
<p>And I understand that buying something sight unseen is always a risky proposition. So before this campaign is over, you will be able to preview little over half the first issue. I'm starting off with posting preview pages of the art, but starting each Monday for the next 3 weeks I will post lettered pages so you can preview the story as well as the art.

</div></div>","The Frankenstein Zombie
Monday July 24
Welcome back, Frank-Fans! Sorry for the late posting. I got back to the East Coast from Comic-Con late Monday night and my system just crashed. So this is going to be a quick one as I post the last preview images for the Frankenstein Zombie. I will be back soon with more news. Hope you all had a great weekend!

Monday July 17th
Hey, Fear-Fans! It's been an emotional rollercoaster with the death of horror legend George Romero over the weekend. The Master is gone, but his influence will live on. 
And since it's not only Monday, but Monday before Comiccon, let's get to the business of this weeks preview pages. Although, there's more than just interior pages to post as the final version of the cover has just been colored by the uber-talented Arsia Rozegar! Wanted to have this ready for the campaign launch, but here it is in all it's glory. 
So, I've got a lot to do before I shuffle off to San Diego, so let's get to the preview!

Monday, July 10th
Okay, gang! I'm back! Still trying to work the indiegogo interface. Was hoping I could do updates like a blog. Anyway, I'm adding the campaign updates to the basic story here. As promised, for the next 3 Mondays (starting this Monday) I'll be posting preview pages of issue 1 of The Frankenstein Zombie. 
Also! I updated our one-and-only perk to make it help make donating even more enticing.
And finally, I hope to have a little update on the cover next time.
Thank you for your support and I hope you enjoy the preview!
Mahalo! David

 
Greetings! If you've watched my video, some of this will seem familiar, but here goes:  I'd like to talk to you about my new comic book horror series ""The Frankenstein Zombie."" Imagine the Monster of Frankenstein waking up in a world where he's no longer the scariest thing in the room. A world where Zombies overrun the countryside and the regular folk who would hunt him down with torch and pitchfork now have to beg for his aid. The Frankenstein Zombie, by its very nature, inspires one to new heights of horror, but it also presents an existential crisis as the Monster tries to define his place in this terrifying new world.
Yes, there will be humor. But humor to help alleviate the horror. This is not a spoof or satire . This is a genuine horror series and I really hope to make y'alls skin crawl as the story unfolds.
I'm very excited about this series and want to tell you all about it. And that's the hard part because if I try to tell you about all the good stuff in the series, I will spoil a lot of it.
Just believe me that this is not some arbitrary high-concept pitch. I have very specific reasons for everything in the book. From the locations, to the characters, to the exact dates used in the story. They are all there for a reason. I think the Monster of Frankenstein is one of the best  myth creations in literature and I hope you will support the Frankenstein Zombie.
About Rewards
As you may have heard in the video, I'm not doing a conventional rewards campaign. That's because it's my opinion that rewards are a mechanism to help finance the creation of the book. There's no need for that here. The first issue is completed and ready for the press. So I'm cutting out all the ""middlemen"", if you will, and getting to the meat of the matter. Like Mad Magazine of old, I'm trying to make this work on unit sales alone.
So, as you see, the price of the donation will get you The Frankenstein Zombie shipped to your door. The donation is $8. You may find that to be an odd number. But this amount will cover the costs of printing, packaging, and shipping. Also, indiegogo will take their piece of that sum. Sales tax will also come into it. As well as the vagaries of international shipping which I can't easily estimate. And there is one other thing most beginning publishers don't count on. A little thing I like to call ""hidden costs"". While I feel I have crunched all the numbers here, I have learned from experience to always bill in a little cushion for ""hidden costs"" that didn't come up during negotiations. I don't mind not making a huge profit on this, but I don't want to go into the hole either. Even at $8 I'm cutting it close. I would feel more comfortable pricing this book at $10 in the beginning, but I'm keeping the faith that I've estimated this correctly. After this first campaign is over and I know the true lay of the land, I hope I can adjust the price for issue 2.
And I understand that buying something sight unseen is always a risky proposition. So before this campaign is over, you will be able to preview little over half the first issue. I'm starting off with posting preview pages of the art, but starting each Monday for the next 3 weeks I will post lettered pages so you can preview the story as well as the art. That will be little over half of the first issue.
In the event we don't hit the goal, if we even come close, I intend to fulfill orders. And if we can't come close, every backer will receive a digital copy of the issue.

<div>Hello, my name is Lawrence Ross, and I'm a writer based on Los Angeles. I've written six books, including the best sellers The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities, and Blackballed: The Black and White Politics of Race on America's Campuses. I've been a managing editor, newspaper reporter, magazine journalist, screenwriter, and NOW, a comic book writer/creator. </div>
<div>My creative philosophy is that a great idea not executed is a great idea wasted. So after having done extensive research, I decided that turning The Casuals into a comic book series would be a fantastic way to tell a new story. A story where underrepresented women were the heroes of the story, and they did it in a way that was authentic. </div>
<div>Your contribution to this Indiegogo campaign is HUGE. Comic book production isn't simply about writing a story and then hiring an artist. Oh no, I learned that quickly!  Your contribution literally helps put The Casuals on the page, and into the hands of comic book lovers. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I'm trying to raise funds for every aspect of the production of The Casuals, while also having enough comic books on hand to sell via Amazon.com and at various comic book conventions. To create a comic book, it's MUCH more complicated than you'd think. You have an illustrator, colorist, letterer, and then you have to have the comic printed. Each point of production has costs, and this fundraiser helps with them.</div>
<div>But don't worry, I'm gonna give you SWAG for helping me reach my dream! Not only do you have an opportunity to be one of the first to get a first issue of The Casuals, but you'll also have an opportunity to get The Casuals FIRST! So check out the incentives!</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>So why support The Casuals, and why now? For one, we live in a world where content is king, and the traditional barriers that once prevented diversity are now falling. The Casuals is both a unique and entertaining story, and it features the women who are often overlooked as the heroes. This isn't just a great story for girls and women, but for EVERYONE . </div>
<div>This is a passion project, and whatever I have a passion for, I go all in. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">But to do this, I'm going to need your help...or else I'm gonna be stuck with a bunch of unread comic books in my home...and the wife won't like that! So make sure to contribute today!</span>
</div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>As we closer to production, I'm going to need MANY people to spread the word about The Casuals. So let me know where you can help!</div>
<div>And whatever you do, PLEASE SHARE THIS ON ALL OF YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORKS!!</div> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Who Am I...and What Am I Doing?

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Back in the day (in October 2010) I started making a webcomic about the various weird and wonderful events that happen in my somewhat <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">polyamorous</a> life. I called it <a href=""http://www.polyinpictures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Poly in Pictures</a>, and didn't realise until many weeks later how appropriate the name was, because I'm a bit dense sometimes. Somehow, with very little poking of the intertubes, I gained a few followers and sold a few home-printed books. Now I'm at around 1,000 hits per day, and I've published over 100 little (and sometimes bigger) comic strips.</p>
<p>I had so much fun making Moo cards of the comics to hand out at conventions, but I never made it to the conventions. Some friends suggested making postcards and greetings cards...</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It just tickles me that my comics might end up on someone's doormat with a stamp and a postmark on it. Some of the comics will have empty speech bubbles, so that people can fill them in with their own weird and wonderful stories. You can see them all if you click ""Gallery"" oop there: ^^</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The postcards will be printed with an indie, co-op-run eco printer, so minimal impact on the environment. I got a quote for 5 different designs, 50 of each, and they told me it'd be around £70.</p>
<p>I need some new pens and a decent camera. The one I have is pretty good, but the buttons have all fallen off and it eats batteries.

<p>And finally, I need to get some more business cards printed. I had 100 Moo cards with lots of different comics on, and they ran out a lot faster than I thought they would. I want to get another 200 printed up, better designs and with some of the newer comics on them. Each card is a mini comic on its own!</p>
<p>What do you get? Better quality comics posted on the site. Some excellent postcards to send to people when you want to make someone smile. Some leetle comics on business cards to keep in your wallet and chuckle at occasionally, or to explain polyamorous concepts to randomers.</p>

<h2><b>Who are we?</b></h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Mike Kwolek, owner and manager of Four Color
Fantasies, Winchester, Virginia’s local comic shop. I started the store in
January, 1987, straight out of college, and, despite having no business
background or courses, I have managed to make a go of it for over 25 years. Twenty
three years ago, my wife and I started buying the property on which the store –
and our house – currently stands, and we are happily chugging along towards
paying off the mortgage. </p>
<p>Despite being a small location, under 1,000 square feet, we
have done our best to build an old school, classic comic book store, with
hundreds of new releases every month as well as one of the largest and most
organized selections of back issues in the Shenandoah Valley. We have over 47,000
unique back issues ranging from the 1940s to present, and are always looking to
expand our selection for our customers. </p>
<p>Our customer base includes over 200 subscribers, ninety five
percent of whom we know on a first name basis, and we strive for a very
friendly, community-oriented atmosphere. Many of our customers comment on how
personalized our service is, and many come in just to hang out and talk comics.
We do <i>not </i>sell on the Internet or do
mail order on a regular basis – we are strictly there for our local community.
The only mail order we do is for customers who have moved out of the area and
who wish to continue doing business with us.</p>
<p>For our customers who aren’t as into comics, but instead are
more interested in (or as interested in) the gaming that is so often coupled
with comics, we also have a small section of RPG products, as well as over
30,000 Magic: The Gathering singles ranging from Unlimited through to
Gatecrash.</p>
<h2>
<b>What do we need?</b> </h2>
<p>Our store is the only occupant in a single story, wooden frame
building that was built in the 1930’s. Its electric blue exterior paint has
become a local landmark, but is wearing badly – cracking and peeling, at this
point. A few years ago, this would have been no problem. I could have gathered
up customers for a painting party and redone the exterior, but that is no
longer the case. Due to changes in state and local laws, any commercial
building built before the 1970’s must have special precautions taken when
scraping the exterior, due to the possibility of lead based paints having been
used. </p>
<p>What it boils down to is that the entire building would need
to be tented over, and qualified workers in full Haz-mat suits must do all of
the scraping and preparation work before new paint can be applied. This means
that a simple paint job will now cost over $20,000 on the low end. I have
looked into alternatives, such as changing the type of siding on the building,
but these alternatives tend to be in the same price range or higher. Also, any
siding change means that we would have to lose our distinctive appearance,
which the city only allows because we have had it for so long and been
grandfathered in as local zoning regulations have changed.  </p>
<p>I’ve been aware of this situation for the past year or so,
since I started looking into getting the store repainted. That’s when I started
attempting to save, but I’ve been unsuccessful so far. One of the obstacles I’ve
run into is a large tax liability because, for a small business, every dollar
that we spend on inventory counts as a dollar of profit. Thus, when I invest
$10,000 towards expanding our merchandise for our customers, I not only no
longer have the $10,000, but I also have a $4,000 tax bill on the “profit” that
I don’t actually have. Another obstacle I’ve had is that I have a daughter in
college, which is putting a further strain on our financial resources. We could
take out a loan, but with already owing over $150,000 to the bank on the
property and college tuition coming due, we don’t want to get in over our heads
in debt, having to default and shut our doors. </p>
<p>This campaign, then, is a start towards raising the
necessary $20,000. We need to get a jump on it, because sooner or later –
probably sooner; we estimate by the end of 2014 – the city of Winchester is
going to tell us that we <i>need </i>to
repaint the building. Once they do, we have 30 days to have it done, or they
can fine and/or close us down. </p>
<h2><b>How can you help?</b></h2>
<p>Obviously, any amount of money that you can donate or pledge
to us would be a huge help towards saving this money. All money raised by this
campaign (minus the indiegogo fees) will go 100% towards getting the needed
work done. We have several nifty perks available at various donation levels;
feel free to donate at whatever level you would like or can safely manage. If
you would like one perk multiple times, or more than one perk, e-mail us with
what you would like when you make your donation. As long as your donation at
least equals the total “value” of the combined perks that you want, you will
get it!</p>
<p>If you are donating, or cannot donate and still want to
help, feel free to link to this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, LiveJournal, Instagram, Pintrest, DeviantArt,
your blog, or any other form of social networking you have to get the word out!
Tell all of your friends, and ask them to spread the word. The more people we
have that know about this campaign, the more likely we will succeed. </p>
<h2>Looking towards the future...</h2>
<p>In the unlikely (but dreamed of!) event that we manage to
raise more than the full $20,000 we need to repaint the store, any extra funds
will go towards our eventual expansion of the building. We would love to have
the space for more comics, more room for people to hang out and chat, for
in-store gaming, for in-store signings (like the one with Jim Caliafore for
Leaving Megalopolis on November 16th), etc. That would probably cost an
additional $50,000 or more. If this campaign is successful, we will probably do
another campaign to raise money for that sometime within the next several
years. </p>

<p>When the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) tries to get
its gloves under the public's skin, the Voluntaryists opt to deliver justice against the invasive blue menace.  Stopping a tyrannical takeover of the body
with government-mandated microchipping will take more than courage – it will
take the will of the people to stand up and say “never again!” to forced
molestation and radiation. Join us in this comic fight for flight freedom as
the Voluntaryists take on the TSA in their most daring adventure yet! <b><i>Voluntaryists
VS. the TSA!</i></b></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>HISTORY: </strong>Voluntaryist
was created by liberty fanatic and costumer Jaime Sherman, whose passion for
liberty is only matched by his passion for cosplay photography. He began the
long process of creating the series while trudging through his graduate
studies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>GOAL: </strong>To
get Voluntaryists Versus the TSA in digital copy and print to share with you,
and, eventually, the world via a free download.<br/></p></li>
<li><p><b>PAGE COUNT: </b>22-24 new pages estimated for a 100% funded campaign.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong><i>We will produce as much of

<p>While the comic is a fun relief
from reality, our hope is that the comic is something beyond its entertainment
value. We would like the comic to get into the hands of people who are
unfamiliar with Voluntaryism and the current state of affairs. We want to wake
people up to Voluntaryism and truly-free living using the comic medium because
it breaks traditional genre barriers.</p>

<p><strong>PUBLIC RELEASE:</strong></p>
<p>We will be releasing the comic to download for free eventually, but those who paid to get the comic e-mailed or printed will
receive it FIRST and will receive the comic about a

its gloves under the public's skin, the Voluntaryists opt to deliver justice against the invasive blue menace.  Stopping a tyrannical takeover of the body
with government-mandated microchipping will take more than courage – it will
take the will of the people to stand up and say “never again!” to forced
molestation and radiation. Join us in this comic fight for flight freedom as
the Voluntaryists take on the TSA in their most daring adventure yet! Voluntaryists
VS. the TSA!  HISTORY: Voluntaryist

liberty is only matched by his passion for cosplay photography. He began the

and, eventually, the world via a free download.

the comic as we can get funded for! The storyline may be adjusted to tailor to the
funding level.

<p>Silent Wars is a comic book series based on the supernatural exploring topics like old stories, mythology, angels and demons, witches, secret cults... The main storiline takes place in a 3000 years old city (Mantova, north of Italy) full of legends and historical places to be used, in addition to it's ancient architecture it has the foggy and misterical atmosphere that gives the right feeling to our stories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the series main timeline we introduce side stories, legends and often bring up flashbacks from the past of the characters enriching the final experience, giving the readers full comprehension of Silent Wars' world. Our goal is to produce a really good storyline, not throwing information to readers but let them discover everything gradually, no mather how long the series will have to be.</p>

<br/><strong>About me:</strong>
</h3>
<p>My name is Jonathan Woods and I have been creating the <em>Barton Flats</em> webcomic (<a href=""http://bartonflats.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bartonflats.wordpress.com/</a>) for just over two years now.  What originally started off as a whim has since become a bit of an obsession and favored pastime.  With over 200 individual comics now constituting the <em>Barton Flats</em> repertoire, I felt it was time to take the current “best of” the collection to print.  <br/><br/></p>

<h3>
<br/><strong>The Genesis of <em>Barton Flats</em>:</strong>
</h3>
<p>I guess my family doesn’t come from the most distinguished lineage, because when my grandparents couldn’t come up with a middle name for my dad, they chose <em>Barton</em> out of the phone book (presumably they couldn’t care to proceed very deep into the phone book, either).  Turns out, according to Wikipedia, that <em>barton</em> is an archaic English word meaning <em>lands of the manor</em>, which, given my dad’s fetish for period England and his fantasy of being a butler in the likes of a Jane Austen novel, seems to fit just fine.</p>
<p>The word <em>flats</em>, well, it just seemed to work – jokes fall flat, girls wear flats as a less spectacular alternative to heels, flats tend to be rather banal, featureless landscapes – plus, (at least in my mind) the combination of words encourages a perceptual spoonerism (<em>fart-on blats</em>, or something like that).</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>     We are a team of artists working to turn educational information into a series of fun comic-strips as an entertaining alternative to learning and absorbing information. I <i>(Rossie Stone)</i> am the director and founder of the project, and I have worked for 4 years as an animator and have loved comics since I was very young. These comics are based on a technique I used to significantly pass my own exams at school, and change the game of education for me. <br/><br/>     If it can help me, then I'm certain there's so many other people it can help. We tested these comics on several different schools ~ across a variety of ages and learning-types, including those with forms of dyslexia and autism. It came back highly enthusiastic and positive by all! This addresses an issue that has long been in the education system. The most common comment we receive from <u>adults</u> regarding Dekko Comics is: <strong><i>""I wish this was available when I was at school."" </i></strong>There is a place for new ways of thinking and learning, and it's a place that Dekko Comics can help fill ~ and in my personal belief has been long-overdue. <br/><br/>We've now made 24 new comics at a higher quality thanks to our earlier crowd funding success to put them into production. If you help us fund the <strong>printing</strong> of these, you will be helping us put a new/under-subscribed way of thinking into the society ~ and an exciting effective method of studying that engages and entertains its readers, rather than just being an easier form. It could help so many people who struggle with conventional learning methods, while also being an entertaining new option for many who possibly don't struggle so much. Think of what this could do for our education-system in the long-run...? </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do we need?</h3>
<p>We're looking for just £1000 as the deal with the printer we have gives us 1250 full 32-page comics of the two issues we'll be releasing in August. It's important to us that we get a decent amount like this to get us going, as we started this project through self-production and being funded by people who wanted to see the project become a reality and cared for its purpose. We want to end it the same way, and being able to manage distribution ourselves at this early stage will give us full control over how we release and present our product. It will also act as a great way to test the waters, and put us in a better position to strike up a relationship with potential <u>publishers</u>, <strong>(we've already received interest from some!)</strong></p>
<p>If we can raise more money, it will go towards  more printing. The better chance we have at getting these comics off their feet, the better it is for the long-run. If we raise more obey than that, some of it will go towards self-marketing costs. If we DON'T hit the £1000 target, what money we have raised will go towards printing as many as we can. <br/><br/>We've upped the rewards since the Kickstarter Campaign, as we're in a better position to do so now. We're offering things that are not just cool, valuable and exciting, but connect you closer to the journey of the project. These include:<br/><strong>- <u>Tickets to the Launch Party</u> in August, where you'll get to experience the moment and celebrations of when these comics finally go on sale. <i>(We may also be having another one in September for another branch, which you will be included in).</i><br/>- <u>Special 'thank-you' art</u> that can be customised by yourself. It will be yours forever, and will be a sort of trophy to mark your support in making the project come together, and what it stood for. It will be quality-made, and will be signed by both the creator (myself) and all the team working on Dekko. <br/>- <u>Signed copies of the two Dekko Comics issues</u> we'll be releasing ~ post&amp;packaged to your address, with a personal thank-you card attached. These will be two of the first issues ever released.<br/>- DELICIOUS, <i>(and we mean it!)</i> artistic cakes from a highly talented bakery </strong><b>professional, Maggie Tennant. She has nearly 2000 likes on her Facebook Page 'Homemade by Maggie' and all from something she does out of a hobby, since she loves it so much. She has been passionately supporting us with Dekko and has kindly offered to make us special Dekko-Cakes ~ plus a £100 voucher to anyone who donates this amount. She doesn't fling those around lightly...</b><br/> </p>

<h3>What <u>IMPACT</u> could this have...?</h3>
<p>These comics are addressing an issue that has long been part of the education-system ~ in which reading is the primary form of communication, and the use of words. There was a time where if you were not a natural or good reader, you would have to work much harder and experience much more failures, or just accept your fate. The priority of reading still exists in the school-systems today, even though there are so many individuals out there who are more naturally visual thinkers, or kinetic thinkers, etc. <br/><br/>As someone who struggled all throughout my school life, it was more than just my school subjects that were affected. Being shouted at by teachers and being made fun of by my classmates (and friends), if I had known that there was a way in which I could not only excel at education but ENJOY it - then it would have made such a difference in my life and would have saved me from so much grief. <br/><br/>There are different ways of learning out there, and I see no reason why there has to be a gap between education and entertainment in any case. When we leave school we're often filled with a hunger to learn, because we're out of the stuffy education system we weren't engaged with or, (in my case), didn't excel or feel natural within. We also learn and pick up things from movies, games, music, conversations, dance, and more. There are so many ways to effectively communicate information, rather than just words alone. How much more interesting is a lecture when it's <u>performed</u> enthusiastically, for example? <br/>If there's one key attribute of Dekko Comics, it's that they focus on being a COMIC before EDUCATION. Focusing on the communication element ~ how you're <strong><i>getting across</i></strong> information ~ is what this project aims to emphasise.<br/><br/>We successfully have run a Kickstarter Campaign to gain raise enough money to put these comics into production. We were looking for £10,000 - we ended up raising <strong>£13,160</strong>. The experience with running that Kickstarter has been valuable to me, and it will serve us well when running this Indiegogo Campaign. I'm also fortunate to be working with a team of people who care very much about the project's cause, and are passionate about making the end product as good as it can be through their art. Furthermore, as someone who has been through some of the struggles these comics address, I can assure you it is my full intention to make the impact I claim it to. <i>I see no point in making such claims otherwise.</i> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What are the Risks and Challenges that lie ahead...?</h3>
<p>Having said this, we're not denying there are potential obstacles along the way ~ nor that things like this are ever easy. Running the Kickstarter Campaign (another crowd funder) before this back in April taught me that. I had to work very hard to make sure the word got around and that we were getting the money we needed to reach our target.<br/>However, that is a big reason why we are well-equipped for this campaign ~ as we have been through the trials and errors that come with the crowd funding ~ and how much conscious effort and preparation is involved. We also came out of the other end of it successfully funded, so we also have experience is making a campaign meet its goal too. However, it is still worth going over some of the risks involved in this endeavour:<br/><br/><i>. Getting the word out: </i>If you're a stranger to too many people, it can be hard to get them to watch your video; let alone reach into their pockets to donate something. One of the things highly recommended in crowd funding campaigns is being connected to a large social network of people that are familiar with you and know you, as they are far more likely to take curiosity and support your project that way. <br/><b>But since the Kickstarter, we now have a network on several different social-media pages supporting and keeping up-to-date with our project. This includes Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Linked-In. We also have a large following of teachers, parents, students, pupils, schools and organisations from the Kickstarter Campaign that we've been growing ever since, and they are keeping up-to-date with any of the latest information regarding Dekko, and are actively sharing our links. (More always helps, though)!</b></p>
<p><br/><i>. More work than anticipated:</i> One of the reasons why preparation is so emphasised amongst experienced crowd fundraisers is that it's so much more work than people think. I have enough wisdom to know now that the funds don't just come 'rolling in'. You've got to persistently engage with people, give updates, and offer new material to get them more connected with the project with. <br/><strong>​However, I am experienced with this now ~ and furthermore, I now have help. In my previous crowd funding campaign I didn't bring team help onto the project until the last couple of weeks. Having those extra hands to the pump was extremely valuable, and allowed me to focus on the main plan while they took care of spreading the word, etc. This time we're already prepared for that, and my Dekko Team will be helping me with distributing the news of Indiegogo and helping me with the tasks. I will also know how to coordinate them more fluently, based on my previous experience.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>. But what about when/if we get enough money to print them? Will they sell? Will it be successful?</i> There are crowd funding campaigns that do not work out even after they have been successfully funded. There is no guarantee of even completing the project, before they even get to taking it to market. And even then, will the world catch on to the idea you're projecting ~ even if the people who funded you thought it was great?<br/><strong>But since getting our funding in April, I have made sure that my team and I stay on schedule and we have managed to produce two comics per week. We are very nicely on track to the original release-date we promised in August, and we intend to realise that claim. Regarding sales, we have a <u>MAILING LIST</u> <i>(which you too can sign up for by emailing info@dekkocomics.com)</i> ~ in which we have a list of people, teachers, schools and organisations already signed up for purchasing the comics ~ receiving updates about the latest news. I have also spoken to independent comic stores that would be very interested unseeing Dekko Comics on their shelves, and they do get a lot of parents coming in. We intend to get these on the shelves on bookshops a little bit later - in September. By then we will have had a taste of how reactive the public is to Dekko Comics, and will make any necessary adjustments there. Money or not, we will also be putting some heavy energy into self-marketing.<br/>Furthermore, we have a stall at the Scottish Learning Festival ~ an event swarming with teachers and school-representatives looking for new ways to teach their kids. Dekko Comics fits right into this, and Dyslexia and Autism instates are showing particular interest. We are already being advertised on the official Scottish Learning Festival website, and will continue to get the word out there about it ourselves also.</strong></p>

<h3>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</h3>
<p>Donations are obviously extremely valuable to us, however big or small. But there's other ways you can help besides donating:<br/>- Get the word out there about our campaign. Tell your friends or, even better, a teacher or someone within the school-system you might know. Better still, a parent or someone who has experienced dyslexia or learning-struggles before. It's just as important to us that this project is funded by the relevant people who it means something to ~ whether that be of them liking the idea or being able to relate to it personally.<br/>- Maybe you know a publisher who might be perfect for Dekko? fire our project their way. You never know what kind of collaborations could happen - and we'd certainly want it to profit both parties!<br/>- SHARE this video and page via your social-media links, (indigo as options for you to do that to your preference). It's a cool project for a good cause and of a highly relatable theme for many. It's unlikely it will look bad on your page. We would say it's a project that's got WORTH in letting people know about it ~ especially in the long-run, if we're successful.</p>

</div></div>","Who are we?
     We are a team of artists working to turn educational information into a series of fun comic-strips as an entertaining alternative to learning and absorbing information. I (Rossie Stone) am the director and founder of the project, and I have worked for 4 years as an animator and have loved comics since I was very young. These comics are based on a technique I used to significantly pass my own exams at school, and change the game of education for me.      If it can help me, then I'm certain there's so many other people it can help. We tested these comics on several different schools ~ across a variety of ages and learning-types, including those with forms of dyslexia and autism. It came back highly enthusiastic and positive by all! This addresses an issue that has long been in the education system. The most common comment we receive from adults regarding Dekko Comics is: ""I wish this was available when I was at school."" There is a place for new ways of thinking and learning, and it's a place that Dekko Comics can help fill ~ and in my personal belief has been long-overdue. We've now made 24 new comics at a higher quality thanks to our earlier crowd funding success to put them into production. If you help us fund the printing of these, you will be helping us put a new/under-subscribed way of thinking into the society ~ and an exciting effective method of studying that engages and entertains its readers, rather than just being an easier form. It could help so many people who struggle with conventional learning methods, while also being an entertaining new option for many who possibly don't struggle so much. Think of what this could do for our education-system in the long-run...?

</div></div>","Andromeda, or The Long Way Home cover
What is Andromeda?
Is it a surreal horror comic? An apocalyptic hero's journey? A psychedelic eco-western? 
At its core, Andromeda follows the journey of a nomad as he struggles tounderstand, thrive and conquer the landscape that surrounds him.It's also a platform for me to explore all the stuff that I love about comics, mythology, folklore, horror, symbology and storytelling.
 
The Book and What's Inside
This will be a 120 page Hardcover book with a cloth bound spine,  a copper hot foil stamped cover and high quality heavy paper stock.Inside you'll find:

​The previously self-published chapters Bugonia (2016)and A House On The Horizon (2017)
A new chapter entitled Our Mother The Mountain.
A selection of illustrations and sketches​!
An ambient music soundtrack CD!

​A guest pin-up gallery  of some of my favorite artists like Mike Mignola (Hellboy), Artyom Trakhanov (Slavic Nihilism), Frans Boukas (Bartkira), John Kenn Mortensen (Sticky Monsters ), Matt Smith (Barbarian Lord),Simon Roy (Prophet) , Aaron Conley (sabertooth swordsman) and others!

 

Preview pages 1&2Preview pages 3,4 & 5

The Goal and Why I Need Your Help:
Self-Publishing is hard and expensive, especially if you want to make a fancy high quality hardcover book.  With this campaign I hope to cover all the expenses in producing a print runof 300 copies (or more in the off chance the campaign supersedes it's goal) and to show my work to a wider audience.   
RewardsBefore checking out: please request the PDF of available pages at  the.art.of.z(at)gmail.com. First come, first served! 
Risks & Challenges
Honestly, there aren't many risks!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Gregory Gregg and I currently live in Colorado Springs, CO. I have been working on my comic series since leaving the ARMY in 2016.  This comic takes place in a post apocalyptic era. </p>
<p>Virgo (The constellation that takes human form) has an ongoing relationship with a being of great power. once she finds out she's with child, she then learns that the being is the ultimate evil which prompts her to place the baby in hiding..There’s an undiscovered prophecy that speaks of a vessel half good half evil walking the earth. The ultimate evil knows of the prophecy and wants to sacrifice his offspring so he can obtain the power of the 13th zodiac. The ultimate evil now has his followers killing and kidnapping any and everyone on earth in an attempt to find this child which throws off the balance of nature. Zodia (the God to all that is good) has been awakened because of the killing and kidnapping ordering his warriors (zodiac signs) to choose a vessel (human) and give them the powers and abilities to restore balance to a world.</p>

<h2>I decided to start a Production Company out of the shop after hearing so many stories from my Industry buddies who put their blood, sweat, and tears into writing and drawing a comic to have some big studio actually agree to turn it into a TV show or a movie.....and then nothing happened. Their book sat on a shelf somewhere because some executive who wasn't even a comics fan lost interest in it.  I want to change that...NOW!</h2>

<h2><em>How You Can Help</em></h2>
<h2>Our goal is simple.  We have a handfull of books we're currently pitching around Hollywood.  So far so good, but we are at the point where we need cash to really get this company up and running. We need to create comic trailers for our books, look-books for pitching them, build a site for comic submissions &amp; more...but we're cash poor. </h2>
<h2>More importantly, we have a few books already written and illustrated that are just waiting to be printed.  Furthermore, we've got ideas from several creators, including top talent like Darick Robertson (HAPPY!, The Boys, Transmetopolitan, etc.) and Writer/Actor Michael McMillian from True Blood, that we need funds to have illustrated and fully brought to life.  These are just a few of our amazing books waiting to be created.  And my partner and I just don't have the money to fund all this ourselves and don't want to bankrupt my family's comic shop in the process.  That's why we need your help.</h2>
<h2>Crowdfunding through Indiegogo seems like a natural fit.  We have some creative ""perks"" that give you value and us some cash, a WIN-WIN scenario.</h2>
<h2>Here are a few Golden Apple books we are developing NOW and need money to fund:     </h2>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Golden Apple Comics
My father started Golden Apple Comics over 30 years ago.  I grew up in the store and, more importantly, in the world of comics.  







I decided to start a Production Company out of the shop after hearing so many stories from my Industry buddies who put their blood, sweat, and tears into writing and drawing a comic to have some big studio actually agree to turn it into a TV show or a movie.....and then nothing happened. Their book sat on a shelf somewhere because some executive who wasn't even a comics fan lost interest in it.  I want to change that...NOW!






I quickly realized in order to really make this happen, part of this company needed to be publishing.  There are a ton of independent creators out there (maybe you're one of them) who have great books or ideas for books that go unnoticed or unpublished because they just can't get their foot in the door in the Comics Industry.  I want to help bring those great books to life.  I want to tell that girl or guy who walks into my store with a cool book they've drawn at home, ""This books is awesome.  I wanna make it.""  





My goal is that Golden Apple Productions will be a company in Hollywood that's on the creator's side as well as the fan's side.  I know good books and I know what the fans like.  That's why I'm coming to you, comic fans for help. I don't want to answer to some guy in a suit with a ton of money, I want to answer to the fans. 



How You Can Help
Our goal is simple.  We have a handfull of books we're currently pitching around Hollywood.  So far so good, but we are at the point where we need cash to really get this company up and running. We need to create comic trailers for our books, look-books for pitching them, build a site for comic submissions & more...but we're cash poor. 
More importantly, we have a few books already written and illustrated that are just waiting to be printed.  Furthermore, we've got ideas from several creators, including top talent like Darick Robertson (HAPPY!, The Boys, Transmetopolitan, etc.) and Writer/Actor Michael McMillian from True Blood, that we need funds to have illustrated and fully brought to life.  These are just a few of our amazing books waiting to be created.  And my partner and I just don't have the money to fund all this ourselves and don't want to bankrupt my family's comic shop in the process.  That's why we need your help.
Crowdfunding through Indiegogo seems like a natural fit.  We have some creative ""perks"" that give you value and us some cash, a WIN-WIN scenario.
Here are a few Golden Apple books we are developing NOW and need money to fund:     


TRIAGE: This is a unique and inventive story about EMT Cassie Jurich who makes a miraculous recovery from an accident to not only find she has physical abilities she never knew, but someone wants to kill her for it.  It's an action/mystery with enhanced human abilities. What more do you want from a book?  The writer, Mairghread Scott (Transformers Prime), has issue 2 written and ready to go.  We want to hire an artist to bring it to life and keep this awesome series going.

<h3>The Totally Flapjack Publishing Project</h3>
<p>I'm Gillian.  I'm responsible for Totally Flapjack, a comic where my son's toys appear in a comic and have adventures.  Hippo-Monkey - somehow loveable despite his opinionated nature - is the undoubted star.  You can see him and his friends at <a href=""http://totallyflapjack.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://totallyflapjack.co.uk</a></p>
<p>A number of people have expressed an interest in owning a published Hippo-Monkey book, and this gave me an idea.  I want to publish some books and all profits from their sale are to go to the Queen's Medical Centre's ante-natal clinic in memory of our eldest son, Jasper, who was stillborn in 2007.  Hippo-Monkey had been bought for him.</p>
<p>This plan covers two things - the first, more frivolous, is that it gets Hippo-Monkey published in book form (all of which will be signed by Hippo-Monkey!).  The second, and far more significant and bittersweet, is that in donating to the hospital he was born in we can create a more positive memorial for Jasper than a headstone in a windy cemetry. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the Money Is For</h3>
<p>The aim is to publish a print run of at least twenty books, but with additional funding we could print even more!  All profits from the sale of the books will be donated to the QMC ante-natal clinic.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Obviously, this won't make a massive impact on the world, but it is hoped that the funds raised from the sale of the books will make a difference to some and, perhaps, help stop a tragedy like ours happening to them.</p>

<h3>Death's New Lease On Life</h3>
<p>Death’s New Lease On Life is a comic in the making. Or Graphic Novel, if you prefer. For children. Ostensibly, at least. About Death. Or, to be more precise, the Grim Reaper. And the need to feel wanted. And penguins. Adelie penguins. So many many Adelie penguins.</p>

It's 32 pages long and tells the story of how a forlorn Grim Reaper came to a better appreciation of life and, subsequently, death. It's funny. And joyous, in it's own way. And it has penguins. Many, many penguins.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/208833/files/20131119062702-DNL-Pg4.jpg?1384871222"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Death's New Lease On Life is written. The story. The jokes. The funny lines. The twists. The turns. The happy ending. That's all done. But none of that is any use unless people get to read it. And for that to happen it needs to be illustrated, coloured, lettered and printed. Which, obviously enough, is where you come in.</p>

<p>Because you're a good person. And look, see, you could make that happen. You could make the Grim Reaper so happy. You could also help a lot of hard work come to fruition. Death's New Lease On Life has been a labour of love for a number of years and now it's this close to being realised. You can be the difference.</p>
<h3><b>But What If...</b></h3>
<p>€10,000 is the amount we want to make this book the best it can be (and believe me it can be great). But we have been very careful to ensure that each reward/perk is self-contained and can be delivered regardless of how much we raise. If you give us €10 for a finished copy of the book, rest assured we can deliver on our promise. If you give us €150 for a limited edition aluminium print, with all the trimmings, then you will get that beautiful piece of art with all the trimmings. So, in that respect, whether we get one backer or a hundred, it doesn't matter (otherwise we would have picked fixed funding). The difference having more backers will make is simple. It will afford Fiona more time to devote to the book (finishing much quicker), give us both more control over the final printed copy and, of course, allow us to do a proper print run. The only question should be do you want to be a part of making this happen. Hint: You do.</p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>My name in Sandy Comstock, and I am an aspiring television writer. You’re probably wondering how I got here, on Indiegogo, pushing an online graphic novel. All I can say is that it literally fell into my lap. I had just finished writing an original series for television and wanted to have a few pieces of concept art drawn up to showcase the tone of the show. A mutual friend referred me to Zach Brown, an award winning speed sketch artist, and I sent him my script. Neither of us knew that fateful first meeting would give way to a much larger project. He teamed up with Sophie, an actress and colorist, to complete the vision. When I received the first piece of art, I was floored. The mythical, magical word I created was perfectly captured. It was like they picked the image directly out of my brain. I knew then that we had something amazing. From there, we decided to embark on our very first graphic novel! So, here we are.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>On the planet Rutas, the mythical lands of Atlantis, Lemuria, Shangri-La, and Shambala continue to thrive. There are many communities and civilizations on this world, and I want to give each a voice. Rutas is a convergence of different pantheons and ideologies co-existing as one.</p>
<p>Currently, the people are experiencing an Age of Light, a prosperous, peaceful and harmonious time. But all that comes to a jarring halt when the 10<sup>th</sup> Kingdom of Atlantis is destroyed. Inexperienced and unprepared for this tragedy, the world is thrown into turmoil and forced to navigate unfamiliar terrain.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE’RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE</strong></p>
<p>This idea is a labor of love for me. I spent years researching and many more compiling the whole story – 10 years in all. It is so exciting to finally see it come to life. My goal is to consistently publish one issue online a month. Book 1 will consist of 8 or 9 issues and depict different character perspectives all circling around the same event: The attack on the 10<sup>th</sup> Kingdom.</p>
<p>I want each character’s story to be seemingly separate from the next. Eventually, their fates will intertwine, as they fulfill their destinies. One of the main characters we follow is Branka, a mystic from the 6th Kingdom of Atlantis. She finds herself in the the center of the attack and is forced to use her magic to defend herself. After her narrow escape, she discovers that the 10th Kingom has fallen and she is the only survivor. Her role solidified, she is determined to find justice for those behind the attack. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED, WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>In order to consistently put out issues, I am asking for $6,000. After Indiegogo and PayPal take their cut, this will leave me with enough to compensate Zach and Sophie, my two amazing artists, for their dedication and work on Volume 1.1, as well as their current efforts on Volumes 1.2 and 1.3. Your contributions will also help maintain the website and hosting and cover any production and shipping costs for hard copies.</p>

Your contributions will also help maintain the website and hosting and cover any production and shipping costs for hard copies.
Every little bit helps, and I greatly appreciate your generosity.
In exchange for your support, you'll be able to choose between some small rewards and some really fantastic packages. Check out the list on the right, and pick your favorite!
