I was rushing around after four kids and trying to decide what was for dinner. My sister-in-law came round and wanted to cook a curry for friends on New Year’s Day.

<p>Chilli Papas was originally born out of adapting my mother's family recipes without oil making them healthier for all the family and has led to the adaptation of other curries through trial and error. </p>

To keep up with demand and expand our range, hand-blending -however satisfying- is not viable so we need to outsource the blending. This may sound boring BUT it will transform Chilli Papas and what we all can achieve.

You can be part of something unique. A Unique product that empowers consumers to eat and cook healthier. We believe Chilli Papas is more than just a product. It is an educational tool. A tool to show that curry can be a healthy option. To be used to feed patients, feed school children and contribute to the recovery of Obesity.

<p>We need to raise £5000 to outsource the blending of our spice mixes. Nothing else but it would make a big difference to the future! For your help we have some exciting rewards and benefits.

Some of you may know me
from my fitness boot camp business, which I've been running for
the past 5 years. From March 2016 I will be closing that business down to fully focus on running the Public Health Collaboration. This may seem like a dramatic and drastic action to take, but desperate times call for desperate measures.</p><p>In the past few years of being in the health and fitness industry I've noticed an increasing
number of doctors coming out of the wood work to support real food
and smart exercise to treat and prevent diseases and conditions, instead of just prescribing drugs and pushing fake food.</p><p>Several months ago I
started having conversations with many of our founding members below about how we can start creating real change in the UK for improving
the health of our nation, which is getting worse year upon year despite all of our best efforts. The one thing that we kept going back to was to collaborate our efforts into one singular organisation to
inform the public and empower the medical community on the science and solutions of health. Over a melting pot of ideas we founded
the Public Health Collaboration, or the PHC for short. Without further ado I'd like to introduce you to the founding members and advisory board of the PHC...</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2><b>The Founding Members</b></h2><table><tbody>

Together they cost the NHS £16 billion a year and the UK economy at large £47 billion a year.</div><div><br/></div><div>These perilous percentages and shocking statistics have presented themselves despite the fact that as a population we are closely following the dietary advice that is being recommended to us. Based on the latest <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-diet-and-nutrition-survey-results-from-years-1-to-4-combined-of-the-rolling-programme-for-2008-and-2009-to-2011-and-2012"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Diet and Nutrition Survey</a> published in 2014 by Public Health England, our total food consumption is on average 383 calories below the recommended, our total fat consumption is just below the recommended 35%, we're just one portion shy of the recommended 5 fruits and vegetables a day, and lastly we're only 1 g over the recommended amount of daily red meat intake.</div><div>

</div><div>So it seems that the actual issue here is that we are generally following the advice we've been given, but it's not making us healthier! Arguably, the current advice has got us into our current sticky situation. A complete overhaul is needed for our dietary advice based on the scientific evidence in order to improve our nation's health, and we believe that the PHC is the team for the job but that is only possible with your support.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h2><b>The Solution</b></h2>
<p>Solving a complex problem such as public health is difficult because there are so many moving parts to take into account. With this complexity often what happens is that lots of money is just thrown at the problem instead of taking a step back and actually thinking about what can be done without spending ridiculous amounts of money to work with the current system in place.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned the current system of dietary advice is working, in as much as the nation is generally following the advice. Unfortunately, it just so happens that the advice being given is making us unhealthy rather than the desired effect of becoming healthy.</p>
<p>With that in mind our solution will be to focus initially on the root cause of the problem by simply improving the healthy eating and weight loss guidelines given by the NHS. Namely the <a href=""http://www.nhs.uk/livewell/healthy-eating/Pages/Healthyeating.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eatwell plate</a> and simple calorie restriction, that have been used for the past 20 years with no improvements in public health. We will improve these guidelines by publishing our first public report on healthy eating and weight loss guidelines given by the NHS in April 2016. Alongside this we will be running a campaign for change that the government will find hard to ignore with the help of our incredibly influential founding members.</p>
<p>After publishing our first public report and running our campaign for change in April we will continuously campaign until our recommendations are taken seriously. However, at the same time we will write our next report to be published in June, which will be on dietary advice for those living with diabetes. As before we will run another campaign for change that the government will find hard to ignore. We will repeat this process with other pressing health issues concerning the UK every 3 months until improvements are made. The key with creating change at this level is to be consistently persistent, something which we're currently lacking in the UK.</p>
<p>£5,000 doesn't sound like it's enough to change anything on a large scale if you're used to big budgets, but we're in a fortunate position that our founding members are giving their time for free to help write our reports and supporting our campaigns. Also, this initial fundraising is to get our first 3 months fully operational and to run our conference on Saturday 11th June. After that we'll need to raise a minimum of £5,000 every 3 months in order to keep everything going at full speed, so the more we can raise now the better the position we'll be in for the future.</p>
<p>Turning the tide on public health in the UK doesn't require throwing ridiculous amounts of money at the problem. It requires sitting back to reflect on how to redirect the NHS's energy, but we need your support to enable us to do that.</p>
<br/>
</div><h2><b>The
Funds</b></h2>
<p>
</p><p>At this point you might be asking yourself, <i>so what exactly will you be spending my hard earned money on?</i></p><p><b>First,</b> to set
up as a charity in the UK you need to raise £5,000 and this initial funding will allow us to operate fully for 3 months to publish our first public report and run our conference. If we raise £10,000 we'll be able to fully operate for 6 months, £15,000 means 9 months and £20,000 gives us 12 months at full speed.</p><p><b>Secondly,</b> we will need funding to cover minimal operational costs. As I mentioned previously, I currently run a fitness boot camp business but after 5
years of trying to improve the health of the UK through that business I feel that the only way to create lasting change is by setting up a charity such as this in order to improve guidelines and public health policy. With that in mind, and provided we raise the requisite funds, I will be running this charity full time and closing down
my fitness business from late March 2016 to completely focus on improving the health of the UK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
This transition will remove my income, and so one of the expenses we'll have, along with admin and technical costs, is a basic salary. At the beginning I will only be receiving a <a href=""http://www.livingwage.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">London Living Wage</a> and will never exceed an average income, as defined by the local authority, in order to stop making the PHC another bloated charity spending too
much money on salaries instead of the cause they are fighting for.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Thirdly,</b> we will need funds to support GPs who want to implement
our solutions for improving their patients health and save money for the NHS. With the funds raised we will also track
the results in these surgeries, and use them in our reports and campaigns to bring about change within the NHS itself.</p><p></p><p><b>Finally, </b>that brings me on to our ambitious campaign plans which will need funding for spreading the message. One of the major campaigns we already have planned will be in June 2016 when we will have our first annual conference in Birmingham on Saturday 11th June with each of our founding members speaking on an area of public health that they're particularly passionate about. On Sunday 12th June we plan to organise a real food rally in London at Parliament Square to campaign for real food throughout the NHS.</p>

The
Basics
What?

The Public Health Collaboration will be set up as a charity focused on supporting research and investigating pressing public health issues concerning the UK.  On a quarterly basis we will publicly publish reports on these issues alongside coordinated campaigns for change.Why?In the UK 25% of adults are obese, the highest prevalence in Europe, and type 2 diabetes has risen by 65% in the past 10 years with no sign of slowing down, both cost the NHS £16 billion a year. The PHC will illuminate the solutions to turn it all around.How?Through INDIEGOGO we need to initially raise £5,000 to help set us up as a charity, fund our team to write our first report to be published in April, as well as support our ambitious research and campaign plans to empower the public and medical community.Either Watch or Read Below
The
Background




 My name is Sam Feltham and I'm the director of the PHC.
Some of you may know me
from my fitness boot camp business, which I've been running for
the past 5 years. From March 2016 I will be closing that business down to fully focus on running the Public Health Collaboration. This may seem like a dramatic and drastic action to take, but desperate times call for desperate measures.In the past few years of being in the health and fitness industry I've noticed an increasing
number of doctors coming out of the wood work to support real food
and smart exercise to treat and prevent diseases and conditions, instead of just prescribing drugs and pushing fake food.Several months ago I
started having conversations with many of our founding members below about how we can start creating real change in the UK for improving
the health of our nation, which is getting worse year upon year despite all of our best efforts. The one thing that we kept going back to was to collaborate our efforts into one singular organisation to
inform the public and empower the medical community on the science and solutions of health. Over a melting pot of ideas we founded
the Public Health Collaboration, or the PHC for short. Without further ado I'd like to introduce you to the founding members and advisory board of the PHC...The Founding Members

To find out more about our founding members visit our website @ www.PHCUK.orgThe IssuesAs previously mentioned in the UK 25% of adults are obese, the highest prevalence in Europe, and type 2 diabetes has risen by 65% in the past 10 years with no sign of slowing down. Together they cost the NHS £16 billion a year and the UK economy at large £47 billion a year.These perilous percentages and shocking statistics have presented themselves despite the fact that as a population we are closely following the dietary advice that is being recommended to us. Based on the latest National Diet and Nutrition Survey published in 2014 by Public Health England, our total food consumption is on average 383 calories below the recommended, our total fat consumption is just below the recommended 35%, we're just one portion shy of the recommended 5 fruits and vegetables a day, and lastly we're only 1 g over the recommended amount of daily red meat intake.

<h3>UPDATE 2015/11/19</h3>
<div>- despite the above goal, we would require a minimum of $100,000 start up capital to construct and operate this indoor park project steadily<br/>- Skate Life Calgary has agreed to join in and partner up on the project<br/>- The indoor park will estimate to be 7000 to 8000 sq.ft</div>
<div>Park feature:<br/>- comfortable resting area for visitors with a view of the skatepark. Parents will be able to keep an eye out to confirm the safety of their children<br/>- onsite skate shop<br/>- on site concession<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">- the skatepark will be skateboards ONLY</span>
</div>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Skateboarding is a growing sport. Everyday, more and more people are getting into skateboarding, more and more skateparks are being built, including Calgary, AB. Canada.</p>
<p>Just this very years, 3 new outdoor skateparks began construction and one was completed in September. </p>
<p>Calgary is prone to long winter, cold weather, and large amount of snow every year, it is very difficult for skateboarders to continue skateboarding. Many would go to parkades and skateboard illegally there. Some get hurt, some get fined, but there is no place for us skateboarders during the winter in Calgary. </p>
<p>All of this can be resolve by simply having an indoor skatepark in or around Calgary, where is it affordable and safe for skateboarders of all ages to use. Under the supervision of adults and employees, we can all enjoy the use of the indoor skatepark.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need to reach the goal of $1,000,000 CAD. It may sound like quite an amount, but if 10% of Calgarians donate $5, the goal could be reached. </p>
<p>I have faith in the community and I believe this is a town with kind hearted members that simply want to improve where they live.</p>
<p>I have personally put in $10,000 into the funding, but I need everyone's help to get this project rolling.</p>
<p>The funding raised will all be used towards the project, not a penny less,<br/>such as:</p>
<p>- property<br/>- construction<br/>- utilities<br/>- taxes<br/>- insurance<br/>- employment<br/>- advertisement</p>
<p>If goal is not reached, the money donated will still go towards building an indoor skatepark. It will only delay the project, but the dream will not die.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Once the indoor skatepark is built, skateboarders will have a place to express themselves over the cruel and long winter.

learn more about the indoor project here: http://alberta.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=766073&a...

UPDATE 2015/11/19
- despite the above goal, we would require a minimum of $100,000 start up capital to construct and operate this indoor park project steadily- Skate Life Calgary has agreed to join in and partner up on the project- The indoor park will estimate to be 7000 to 8000 sq.ft
Park feature:- comfortable resting area for visitors with a view of the skatepark. Parents will be able to keep an eye out to confirm the safety of their children- onsite skate shop- on site concession- the skatepark will be skateboards ONLY

Short Summary Skateboarding is a growing sport. Everyday, more and more people are getting into skateboarding, more and more skateparks are being built, including Calgary, AB. Canada.
Just this very years, 3 new outdoor skateparks began construction and one was completed in September. 
Calgary is prone to long winter, cold weather, and large amount of snow every year, it is very difficult for skateboarders to continue skateboarding. Many would go to parkades and skateboard illegally there. Some get hurt, some get fined, but there is no place for us skateboarders during the winter in Calgary. 
All of this can be resolve by simply having an indoor skatepark in or around Calgary, where is it affordable and safe for skateboarders of all ages to use. Under the supervision of adults and employees, we can all enjoy the use of the indoor skatepark.   What We Need & What You Get We need to reach the goal of $1,000,000 CAD. It may sound like quite an amount, but if 10% of Calgarians donate $5, the goal could be reached. 
I have faith in the community and I believe this is a town with kind hearted members that simply want to improve where they live.
I have personally put in $10,000 into the funding, but I need everyone's help to get this project rolling.
The funding raised will all be used towards the project, not a penny less,such as:
- property- construction- utilities- taxes- insurance- employment- advertisement
If goal is not reached, the money donated will still go towards building an indoor skatepark. It will only delay the project, but the dream will not die.
    The Impact Once the indoor skatepark is built, skateboarders will have a place to express themselves over the cruel and long winter. For many like myself, we live and breathe skateboarding. Being part of the skateboarding community is as having a second family that will help you and treat you as equal no matter who you are, where you're from, or what is your gender.Many of us need this place we call our second home, where we don't feel lost in the world.
    Risks & Challenges Challenges may occur when the right location could not be found for the right price.We are aiming for an industrial warehouse within the City of Calgary that is near a bus stop or train station. 
Once the location is found, everything else should be smooth sailing with the perfect business plan.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Melissa.  Wife to Christopher (married 15 years this June) and Mom to 3. My daughter Eva, who is the oldest is in need of braces due to teeth that are overlapping, teeth that have come in crooked, teeth that have come in, in the wrong place, impacting others below the gums, and several other minor issues that will be addressed simply because we took care of the more pressing ones.</p>
<p>We have turned to Indiegogo because we simply do not have the necessary funds to begin the process. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise the necessary funds (approx $2,000) to begin round one.  This includes speech/occupational therapy to correct some issues before we begin.  The typical amount of visits is 3, but after talking to the clinic it appears that Eva made need more than this.  However, they cannot determine how many visits it will take until we begin the sessions.  Next up is a baby tooth that needs to be pulled, the costs of a records appt, a spacer that will be inserted and then the actual braces.  These will be worn for approx 8 months before we move on to round 2.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal we will use everything we do get, to get the ball rolling.  If we surpass our goal, the additonal funds will be set aside and put towards the costs for the 2nd round of treatment.  At this time we do not know how much that will cost as I have been too overwhelmed with the cost of the 1st round to ask. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My biggest concern at the moment is to bring some relief to my child who complains of her teeth and gums bothering her almost daily.  Upon visiting the dentist, to see what else we could do in the mean time, we were told that the spacer/braces are the only remedy. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Bill, my domestic partner was burned in an explosion 3 years ago. He was burned over 73% of his body, 3rd degree.</p>
<p>We are blessed that he survived what we were told was the un survivable. But the burn was not the full extent of his injuries.</p>
<p>His eye lids turned inside out and had to be removed. The doctors re-grafted new eye lids taken from another part of his body, but the first graft failed. and they needed to be done again.</p>
<p>This is where it would get easy to blame nurses in the hospital for not keeping the grafts lubricated enough, but however it happened, the new eye lids scratched his cornea's and have blinded him as a result.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, He has had to have all 10 fingers amputated. Being newly blind, he can't even feel his way around, and depends on me for everything.</p>
<p>I am a cancer survivor, and myself, disabled. We are very blessed by my health issues as they have allowed me to be by his side 24 hours a day, providing the care he needs in order to keep him out of a home.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Vince needs a cornea transplant to restore his eye sight. Unfortunately, the fire killed off the stem cells around his cornea's, which are needed to support the transplant. Without these stem cells, any cornea transplant would fail, so first, he must get a corneal stem cell transplant.</p>
<p>Let me take just one moment to THANK YOU for having the compassion to read this far into our story. We realize it's kind of in depth to try to read the full extent of our need, But we really are trying to be as transparent and open to explaining everything about our situation, So you know my intentions are sincere. We really do appreciate you staying interested in our plight and continuing to read our story.</p>
<p>Now, There are Very few eye centers in the country who do corneal stem cell transplants. And of them there is only ONE (To the absolute best of our knowledge) that has done any work using the patients own stem cells from other parts of the eye.</p>
<p>Usually, if a patient's stem cells are too damaged to support the cornea transplant, they are able to take the stem cells from the other eye's corneal stem cells. In Vince's case, BOTH eyes are damaged beyond the ability to support the corneal transplants without stem cell transplants.</p>
<p>In this case, stem cells are often harvested from cadaver donors. When this is done, the patient must go on immune suppressing drugs so they do not reject the donor stem cells, just as any other organ transplant.</p>
<p>Vince has been seeing the cornea specialist at the county hospital here in Dallas for 3 years now, and to be honest, they seem to be making it as difficult as they can to even go ahead with a cadaver donor transplant AND THEY WILL NOT EVEN READ THE RESEARCH I HAVE PRINTED OUT AND GIVEN THEM FROM THE CLEVELAND CLINIC IN OHIO.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Clinic in Ohio has done miracles working with corneal stem cells when the patients own stem cells are damaged in both eyes. They have successfully taken stem cells from another part of the eye all together, lay them on the corneal stem cells, where they transform into the type of stem cell needed to support the cornea transplant. THE CLINIC HE IS GOING TO NOW WILL NOT EVEN LOOK AT THE RESEARCH, and insist on trying the cadaver donor transplant, and will offer him no other option</p>
<p>I'm sure it would be natural for you to wonder what the big deal is, Why is it so important to try to avoid using cadaver stem cells. --- Well, the fire has left Vince's lungs permanently damaged, and frankly, his immune system compromised as it is. He has had pneumonia 3x since his release from the hospital. Twice I was told he might not survive the pneumonia. It has been explained to us that Vince going on the immune suppressing drugs by itself could kill him. So, in addition to the fact he just is not getting the medical care from his cornea specialist that we would all wish for anyone in his position,, Being able to go to a clinic that actually cares about the results they offer their patients may actually save his life if they are able to use his own stem cells to regenerate his corneal stem cells. (By using his own, he will not need to be on the immune suppressing drugs)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>PLEASE understand, over the 10 years prior to Vince's accident, He carried me through two separate rounds of chemotherapy each lasting several months, as well as a 4 month course of radiation combined with 2 weeks chemotherapy.</p>
<p>This man is the type of friend everyone needs in their life, and even today, his bubbly disposition keeps everyone he knows laughing and experiencing the love he so willingly gives this world. The world really is a better place because he is in it.</p>
<p>If he were able to see again, It would be no time before he was out in the community offering encouragement to other burn survivors. Already he often stops and talks to the family members of patients in the burn unit ICU, Offering them encouragement and showing them that miracles do happen. Giving them hope when in the natural world, there just doesn't seem to be any within sight for them at the time.</p>
<p>But blind, he is only a shell of a man, trying to be patient as he waits in his lonely existence until God send an angel with a message that hope is on it's way.</p>
<p>That is why I want to take him to a clinic where this is their specialty, Where they will address his blindness with a determination to solve the issues affecting HIM. And the sad part is that the technology is there to do it. BUT where he is now, he is being looked at as though they have saved his life, and he should be happy with that. And yes, we are thankful for the talents of the WONDERFUL burn doctors who saved his life, and the PM&amp;R doctors who do very well at addressing and trying to manage his pain. But no hospital can have a perfect record in every department, and he is definitely falling through the cracks in the eye clinic of this hospital. I believe that they just have too many patients there for them to have compassion for any of them.</p>
<p>The money I am requesting is to cover the trips from Dallas to Cleveland, a hotel and rental car for the trips needed to get him established at the Cleveland Clinic. In addition, Vince will be responsible for 20% of all medical bills (All Dr appointments, procedures &amp; transplants)</p>
<p>I really do foresee our actually cost being much higher than what I have requested on here, But even if I don't get the full amount requested, What we do receive will go toward travel, Dr appointments, and even if we can't pay for the full amount of the procedures upfront, what is left will be used as down payments toward the procedures needed.</p>
<p>In closing, I can't thank you enough for spending the time to read our story and considering our request. for the next five minutes, please try to notice everything each of your fingers touch. Consider how you would do it without any fingers at all. Then if you can, try to imagine how you would do it if you couldn't even see the position each of your knuckles are in (The 1st knuckle where your finger meets your hand). This is the world I am trying to free him from.</p>
<p>There really has not been much opportunity for him to learn any independence in his disability. Outside of a gal who comes by 5 days a week to help me with housework, Vince and I are alone in Dallas, needing to live here for his medical care. If he were to get his eye sight, we could move to be with family again. And perhaps he would even be able to get some kind of a job, restoring his dignity and sense of self worth again.</p>
<p>I am sorry this has been such a long article, Vince is one of God's beautiful souls placed on this earth to touch each of our lives. I promise you, every penny sent to assist us will be appreciated and we will keep each of you in our prayers of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Even if you are unable to help financially, perhaps you could post our story on your face-book page, or other web site that might point potential donors in our direction. Also Indiegogo suggest we remind you to use the Indiegogo share tools. I really don't know what that means, but hopefully you do. If the site allows you to email us, we will be glad to answer any questions you may have for us.</p>
<p>Also, I have seen prayers answered in hours as he lay fighting for his life. even the smallest, quickest, yet sincere little prayer could have a huge impact on our situation. All prayers, love and well wishes are welcome, THANK YOU with all our hearts.</p>
<p>May God bless you, as you have blessed us.</p>

<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"" id=""id_509e859248dbb4f34156310"">Fourteen weeks ago, this little girl was living the life of your average 6-year-old: She had just started the first grade and had just moved into a new apartment with her mother and brother. The family had just been able to afford an apartment in a nice neighborhood where the kids could play outside and climb trees. Her mother had worked so hard to provide for her children and was now overjoyed that they could live and go to school in a family-friendly area.</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">She was playing with and tormenting her older brother, taking vacations with her grandparents, singing, laughing, climbing her favorite tree, and <em>dancing.</em> With an infectious laugh and sense of grace, an indiscribible connection to the earth and all its wonder, a thankfulness for everything large and small, compassion, and an innate desire to <em>live</em>, her very presence restored passion to the weary. I remember once, when given the gift of a mere pair of hand-me-down flip-flops, Mia placed her hands on her cheeks, took in a deep breath, and - with nothing more than a sheer, unabated sense of gratitude - squeeled ""OHHHH, THAANK YOU!!!!"". We all smiled and were blessed by her absolute passion for the everyday.  </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">She was the epitome of thankfulness that we should all aspire to be. She didn't know a stranger. She would walk into a room full of people, survey it, stick her hand into the air, and say, ""Hi! I'm Mia!"" Almost as if to say, ""I am here to brighten your day and fill your soul!""</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">Around eleven weeks ago, her 14-year-old brother, Ethan, came down with a cold/flu virus and recovered fairly quickly. So, when Mia came down with cold and flu symptoms, it appeared to be nothing abnormal. Her mother, Michelle, did what all of us moms do and consoled her child. She treated the symptoms and tried to wait it out. Until one night when she ran a short errand and left Mia in Ethan's very capable hands. When she returned home, Mia approached her and said she ""Couldn't see"" and got up to go to the kitchen. She ran into a chair and fell. When Michelle went to help her up, she was confronted with every mother's worst nightmare. Mia's body stiffened and she began to seize. Never having dealt with any medical issues with either of her children, she immediately took action and called 911. The EMT squad arrived and took her to the hospital.</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">From here, Mia suffered several more seizures and eventually went into Cardiac Arrest. A very precarious situation, the Emergency Room nurses refused to give up. She was administered heart massage and resuscitation for an unheard of FOUR hours. Once they were able to get somewhat of a trace heartbeat, the doctors decided to try a fairly new method of heart and lung assistance called ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) to help support her heartbeat. From here, she was placed on many other forms of support. All of her vital organs had shut down, she had a collapsed lung, and her heart was only pumping on a machine. The potential outcome was grim.</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">Her brain was without continuous oxygen for four hours. Because of the extensive brain damage caused by lack of oxygen, Michelle was given a very grim prognosis for her child. The Cardiologists and Neurologists said the words no mother should ever have to hear about her child:</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">""Mia has suffered severe trauma to the brain due to the amount of time without oxygen... You may want to begin thinking about her quality of life... IF...""</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">After the initial shock, Michelle made the decision to commit her life, and the life of her children, to God. To put Mia in His hands and to rely on faith in the unseen. He began to work. When Michelle prayed for strengthening of Mia's heart and lungs, Mia's heart and lungs gained strength. When Medical Science finally caught up and there was an X-Ray, Mia's left lung had been restored! When the doctors felt that removing certain machines would be detrimental to Mia's survival and there was concentrated prayer over the function they performed, they would begin experiencing problems with those machines. It became necessary to remove them one-by-one (ECMO, dialysis, various IV feeds) because it would have been more detrimental to have her remain on them! The same thing happened with medications. When the doctors wanted to ""try"" to remove her from certain medications and see whether her heart would be strong enough to maintain function, it always was.  </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">""'For my thoughts are not your thoughts; neither are your ways my ways', declares the Lord."" (Isaiah 55:8) Contrary to all that was before us and the doctors, this child is now walking, talking, laughing, reading, singing, and eating (among many other things the original prognoses suggested). She is gaining strength daily. Best of all, she has not lost any of the personality we all loved so much. She has touched the lives and hearts of every person with whom she has come in contact. The doctors who made the original assessments of her possible future now walk by her room, stop in, smile, shake their heads, and say, ""AMAZING"".</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">Defying all odds, medical science, human knowledge or understanding, Mia will be going home with her mother and brother on November 21! Her only remaining obstacles are a g-tube to administer the heart medications she will require for an undetermined amount of time. The doctors now pass information to Michelle with the caveat, ""We don't put anything past her"", or ""She has surprised us before"". She is working daily to strengthen her muscles in order to be able to use them as often and as freely as she used to. She greets all who visit with that huge ""Mia smile"", laughter, and a huge hug. She says, ""I love you"" often and without abandon.</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">She is a miracle. </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">This is where you come in:</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">She needs your support so that she may continue the laughter. Her mother is every bit as much a fighter as she is, but is unable to carry the burden of Mia's medical expenses alone. For the ECMO treatment alone, the cost is around $16,430 per 24 hours. Mia withstood approximately one week of this treatment, which has been known to cost up to $1,238,004. (CTSNETJOURNALS; November 11, 2012) Again, this is only one of her treatments. She has to have continuous care for Myocarditis and follow up treatments for her g-tube (including possible eventual removal, prayerfully), therapy, and follow-up care.</div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed""> </div>
<div class=""text_exposed_root text_exposed"">It goes without saying that EVERY dollar counts! Mia and Ethan deserve a childhood not fraught with constant financial strain - and a mother who is able to not live in daily fear of being able to pay these bills. Whatever you are able to give is a blessing to all three of them.</div>
</div></div>","Fourteen weeks ago, this little girl was living the life of your average 6-year-old: She had just started the first grade and had just moved into a new apartment with her mother and brother. The family had just been able to afford an apartment in a nice neighborhood where the kids could play outside and climb trees. Her mother had worked so hard to provide for her children and was now overjoyed that they could live and go to school in a family-friendly area.
 
She was playing with and tormenting her older brother, taking vacations with her grandparents, singing, laughing, climbing her favorite tree, and dancing. With an infectious laugh and sense of grace, an indiscribible connection to the earth and all its wonder, a thankfulness for everything large and small, compassion, and an innate desire to live, her very presence restored passion to the weary. I remember once, when given the gift of a mere pair of hand-me-down flip-flops, Mia placed her hands on her cheeks, took in a deep breath, and - with nothing more than a sheer, unabated sense of gratitude - squeeled ""OHHHH, THAANK YOU!!!!"".

<h3>Help Maureen fund her Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction training</h3>
<p>My name is Maureen Lauer-Gatta. I have been teaching yoga for 10 years. In 2011 I participated in the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training that was held at my yoga studio -- The Yoga Room in Warren, Ohio. While there are many outlets to practicing compassion and living a full life, I embraced the MBSR program. It has given me abilities to practice compassion for myself when things feel overwhelming. I struggle with the idea of death and dying on a daily basis. Yoga has become an outlet for me to stay calm during my practice, but the Mindfulness techniques have enabled me to take this off my mat and into my daily life by not dwelling on my personal struggles.</p>

My name is Maureen Lauer-Gatta. I have been teaching yoga for 10 years. In 2011 I participated in the Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) training that was held at my yoga studio -- The Yoga Room in Warren, Ohio. While there are many outlets to practicing compassion and living a full life, I embraced the MBSR program. It has given me abilities to practice compassion for myself when things feel overwhelming. I struggle with the idea of death and dying on a daily basis. Yoga has become an outlet for me to stay calm during my practice, but the Mindfulness techniques have enabled me to take this off my mat and into my daily life by not dwelling on my personal struggles.
The MBSR program at my studio is based on a sliding pay scale. I would like to continue this and offer others the ability to take part in these life-enriching techniques.

<h3>Greg's Story</h3>
<p>Greg Dixon is a hardy soul. He hunts moose every year to provide for his family and shares with others. He also fishes each summer. In fact, it is not unusual for him to leave Fairbanks on a Friday after work, drive 320 miles to Chitina, unpack his dipnet and some Pilot Bread (TM), and fish from the rocky riverside. He'll stay for a day or two to catch some of those beautiful Alaskan Copper River red salmon, then return to Fairbanks for work or more play. Or it's back to work at the  gold mine.</p>
<p>Greg works at a gold mine somewhere north of the Glenn Highway, in one of those mountain valleys none of us have ever seen, and probably never will. Greg and several people live there throughout the summer, hoping to leave a little richer, and maybe even a little wiser.</p>
<p>When he's gone during the summer, Greg leaves wife Sasha, born and raised in Fairbanks, and three children, ages five, eight, and ten. The kids have been schooled at home and their playground is the great outdoors. Sasha and Greg and their friends teach their children by teaching them their surroundings. They plant and grow a garden and greenhouse organically. The kids run barefoot everywhere. They need a bath in the summer all the time, but forget it, they will be dirty again in an hour.</p>
<p>Imagine the horrifying news in December when they found out that Greg had cancer of the colon. Later, they learned the cancer had metastasized to the liver, making it necessary to postpone surgery.</p>
<h3>Why We Are Fundraising </h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Between November when Greg first saw a doctor in Fairbanks, Alaska and January when Greg began receiving chemotherapy treatment in Katy, TX, Greg and Sasha had accumulated over $50,000 in medical bills. Greg is seeing an oncologist in private practice who was trained at the renowned MD Anderson. This reduces the bills by not having the high overhead associated with MD Anderson. They have also received some assistance from pharmaceutical companies who are willing to provide medication at a discount. Some of Greg's treatment costs are now being covered by private medical insurance, but some are not. The cost of the hospital stays, oncologist, chemotherapy, and upcoming surgeries (at least two) are accumulating at a staggering rate.  </p>
<p><strong>The Dixon Family </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Greg grew up on Cordes Way in Goldstream Valley and went to West Valley High School. His father, Larry Dixon, moved his family to Fairbanks from Florida, where he had worked at Cape Canaveral. Unfortunately, Larry passed away in December, soon after Greg learned he had cancer, and before Greg could return to Anchor Point to see him again. Greg's mother Fran continues to live in Anchor Point where she is an avid quilter. Greg has three sisters: Carla, Paula, and Lynette. Lynette has temporarily re-located to Texas to help Sasha and Greg by looking after their children while her own children are at home.  </p>

<p>**UPDATE**<br/></p>
<p>Dear Backers, </p>
<p>We are sorry for our extremely bad communication here. We have no excuses other than us being inventors and not to skilled in communications (with humans anyway). Actually, we didn’t even KNOW about the possibility to communicate here until one of you kindly reminded us. </p>
<p>Now, to our common project, the No More Woof headset, we where totally shocked by the interest from global media. One can say that all of you backers jumped onto something that really stirred something deep in people. The possibility to, in some rudimentary way, communicate in a new way with animals. </p>
<p>Anyway; we are working like crazy trying to identify the patterns in our beloved pets brainwaves and build the interface to fit the components in a sturdy and dog friendly way. So far we’ve both encountered obstacles and made progress. As always, our biggest issue is that we tend to aim to high. This project is partly self-funded, and partly funded by you. It is not a billion dollar Darpa project, but we seem to set goals as if it was. </p>
<p>Our new timing Schedule allow us to have the units ready by the end of may, only one month late. Then we will start shipping the No More Woofs. </p>
<p>Meanwhile: <a href=""http://www.nordicinvention.com/images/nomorewoof.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a> are some unique picture only for you from our latest testing (the dog is called “Jocke”). </p>

It is not a billion dollar Darpa project, but we seem to set goals as if it was. 
Our new timing Schedule allow us to have the units ready by the end of may, only one month late. Then we will start shipping the No More Woofs. 
Meanwhile: HERE are some unique picture only for you from our latest testing (the dog is called “Jocke”). 
HERE you’ll find a movie that Volvo made for us. 
We’ll try to update you again here as soon as we’ve made any progress (or encountered a new hurdle). 
Until then, please visit our Facebook-page at https://www.facebook.com/TheNordicSocietyForInventionAndDiscovery
And once again: thank you for your support. It reality matters, not only to us, but to science!!
/The NSID
No More Woof aims to develop a small gadget that uses the latest technology in micro computing and EEG to analyse animal thought patterns and spell them out in Human Language* using a loudspeaker. But we admit, we are optimistic dreamers, so even more importantly we want to raise AWARENESS about this area of science, and point others to the potentials! Among the patterns we have found are ""I'm Tired"", ""I'm excited"" and possibly ""I'm Hungry"" and the clearly intense brain activity  when a dog sees a new face, that we translate into: ""Who ARE you?"". So far we have funded this project all by our own means, and we have DELIBERATELY set the amount of money we want to raise really low, not to get peoples hopes up. In the end, this will only be the start of future development!As we see it, by pre-ordering your own set of NO MORE WOOF, you are not only buying the first edition of a cool product (that might not be perfect) but more importantly, you are showing your support for further research into finally breaking the language barrier between animals and humans. Join the movement!

The technology used in No More Woof is the result of combining the latest technologies in three different tech-areas, EEG-sensoring, Micro Computing and  special BCI software. During the last decade huge discoveries have been made to map out the human brain’s functions. But never before has anyone made a serious attempt to apply this groundbreaking technology on man’s best friend.For instance there is a spectrum of specific electrical signals in the brain defining the feeling of tiredness.Some of the most easily detected neural patterns are: ""I'm tired"", ""I'm curious who that is?"" and ""I'm excited"". (It is worth pointing out that dogs ""think"" in a different way than humans. Whereas the dog's brain signals might indicate excitement, that does of course not really mean  the dog is ""thinking"" that, it's rather more a mental state than a ""thought"": the dog IS excited. However, the difference between thoughts and mental states is actually an interesting philosophical question, for those who are into these things.) 
Every mammal creates and transports ""thoughts"" the same way, as a swarm of electrical signals through a complex neurosystem). It has long been possible to record this activity through Electroencephalogram (EEG) readings. When it comes to humans, the last decade has seen tremendous progress. 
However every species uses its unique structure. You could say that all creatures speak the same language only with varying dialects. And as animal brains are less complex than humans their signal patterns are more distinct for feelings of anger, curiosity or tiredness – actually making them easier to distinguish.The challenges we are facing using EEG on pets are a matter of placement for best comfort and how to identify the clearest signal when attaching the device on fur (we would never let you shave a tonsure on your beautiful German Shepard).
We are experimenting with a new brain-computer interface (BCI) to detect, analyze and translate the brainwaves of dogs into comprehensive thoughts.Earlier the devices had to stream thought sequences, but now we are using Raspberry PI, which handles this process directly inside the device. This might not seem as a big deal, but actually it clearly distinguishes this project from all previous research. When the EEG readings are gathered, you could say that the trick of reading an animal’s mind is stripped down to a more or less complex deciphering problem. Right now we are only scraping the surface of possibilities; the project is only in its cradle. And to be completely honest, the first version will be quite rudimentary. But hey, the first computer was pretty crappy too. For more information, read about us in Wired or Gizmodo.http://www.nordicinvention.com
Finally, we must AGAIN stress that ALL the products are at the first stage and shall be regarded as research support. (If anyone at ANY point like their money back, we will give it to you. For us this is actually most of all a way to raise INTEREST around this magical area of research!)That said, they will definitely work on a basic level (identifying excitement and tiredness for instance) with dogs and we can actually think of no cooler products, and yeah, we're basically building them because we want them ourselves. (We've spent more money on this than we will ever receive :)",26.0,0,"8 Campaigns

=============================================================
Toya has always been a fighter, a survivor. She is a loyal friend, a compassionate mentor, a creative force to be reckoned with. Now she needs our help for a challenging period of recovery from a painful spinal condition that has put her life on hold. We, her partner, family, and friends, have loved and helped Toya as best we can over the last three months, and we’re now reaching out to bring in more support to help her cross the finish line. The world needs Toya back to full strength and you can help her get there!
Toya’s Story
Since mid-April, Toya has been suffering from debilitating back pain, often hitting excruciating levels. An MRI eventually showed that she had a severely herniated lumbar disc causing significant inflammation, spinal stenosis, damage to neighboring vertebrae, and nerve impingement. What does that mean? PAIN. Pain in the lower back and radiating down the legs, making walking difficult to unbearable. 
She’s spent most of the last three months in bed requiring help with basic needs, and using a wheelchair when she’s able to leave the house. Toya had to leave her job as a Physical Education Specialist at an afterschool program AND had to leave school two weeks before earning her Associate’s Degree in Early Childhood Education. Financially, she and her partner, Jen, have been struggling to cope with the loss of Toya's income during this time of increased needs.
Navigating the health system has been an all-consuming project for Toya and Jen. Toya has been to the ER three times while waiting to see various specialists who offered inconsistent advice and little relief. On June 21, Toya’s 28th birthday, she finally saw a highly recommended orthopedic surgeon who explained her condition more thoroughly and said she had been given poor advice and was on the wrong meds. 
Toya had a microdiscectomy on July 3 - an outpatient surgery to remove the part of the disc that was impinging on the nerve and causing her pain (see the Gallery for an image of the MRI showing the ruptured disc). She has experienced some improvement since the surgery, but it could be weeks or months until her pain decreases to tolerable levels. Toya continues to require support while she recovers the ability to care for herself independently, return to work, and continue her education.
As frustrating as the situation has been, Toya is not despondent. Toya is a fighter! She is fully dedicated to her recovery and has thrown herself into the healing process. 
Community & Recovery
Toya has cultivated a supportive and nurturing community in Albany which has risen up to help with house work, cooking, and errands during this difficult time. The road to recovery has already been longer than anticipated, and it is impossible for her partner and friends to keep up with the level of assistance required... and more costs still lie ahead.

Our minimum goal is to raise $7,500 to support Toya’s successful recovery! 

Your donation will help Toya with medical expenses not covered by insurance: physical therapy and assistive devices, complimentary treatments like acupuncture and massage, and transportation to appointments. Because she’s been out of work, Toya needs help covering basic needs like rent, utilities, phone bills, and food. She has also had to hire people to help her with daily activities while she recovers - both household help and getting out of the house. Every time she leaves home, she needs help walking and someone to carry her wheelchair down two flights of stairs. Jen does what she can but is nearly out of paid time off from work.
But there's more, because we want Toya not just to recover and survive, but to get back to thriving. We hope to raise $10,000. Toya will use the additional funds for things that improve her quality of life: art supplies and classes, a personal trainer to help her regain her strength and move her back toward her goal of running a 10k, and additional health and wellness needs. Any further donations will help Toya continue her college education towards her Bachelors degree in Physical Education.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you want to do more than just donate, or if you cannot make a donation at this time, please share this Indiegogo campaign with your Facebook community and email contacts. Toya is printing and mailing this request to relatives who don’t use the internet, and we’re happy to print copies for others. If you prefer to donate offline, please contact us.
Donate, get the word out, and help Toya get pain free, back on her feet, and out into the world where she will again be inspiring others with her love of life and drive to overcome! She can't wait to be back with ""her kids"" at the aftershool program and back to practicing her passion!
                                      THANK YOU!
Thank you in advance for your generosity! Every little bit helps. 
- Jen & everyone at ""Team Toya""

<b style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">FUNDRAISER: <i>BEATING CANCER</i></b><br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<div>    This fundraiser is for Scott and his mother Marilyn who has <b>terminal</b> cancer. She has <b><i>pancreatic cancer</i></b>. She has been ill most of her life with various illnesses and is also a diabetic which has caused many other issues such as loss of mobility and sensation/feeling in her hands and feet. About two years ago, Scott took his mother to the doctor and after six months of appointments and scans, she learned she had pancreatic cancer on top of diabetes. She had underwent chemotherapy but was just recently told that it had spread to her stomach and lungs. She has not been given a time frame at this moment. Scott's biggest concern is the current medical bills that continue to mount and medication needed to improve the quality of his mother's life along with the household expenses. </div>
<div>   Scott, being ill himself, is currently unable to work. He is the father of six children; with the youngest being less then one years old. He takes care of his family as well as taking care of his terminal mother too. The cost for aids for Marilyn, house bills, medical expenses and ultimately funeral cost are in the minds of Marilyn, Scott and his family.  Not only has medical gone up in price but the cost of living and unfortunately funeral cost have increased too. Scott has a lot on his plate. I applaud him for all that he does for his family and putting himself last. Not many would do what he is doing and I have the utmost respect and admiration for him. He is a strong man but even the strongest person is in need of a hand up. So I am asking for your help.</div>
<div>    We are in need of funding to help to pay for unpaid medical expenses, medication, and household bills like food, electric, gas, etc. and the expected funeral cost that is in the near future. Unfortunately Scott and his mother Marilyn are in this situation and time is not on their side.  And without those things, the quality of Marilyn's life will decrease and make things harder for his family. Life is hard enough without having to worry about how your going to pay your bills. With the proper care, medical attention, medication, and everyday living expenses paid, it will not extend the amount of time that Marilyn has left but it WILL increase the quality of her life and help Scott to improve on the quality of his families life too. I believe that quality outweighs quantity.</div>
<div>   Whether we reach our goal or not; whether it's $1000 or $10,000, it will make the quality of Marilyn's and Scott's  lives better from what it is now. </div>
<div>   Life is full of love, happiness, pain and tears. But its what we do with that, that makes it count; that makes living worth while and makes those that you love and that love you back, that much more meaningful, heartfelt and deeper. It gives life the meaning that we all are in search of. Helping a stranger out and knowing that you are a blessing in the shadows.</div>
<div>   We all take life for granted. And it isn't until that moment, when you realize that you might loose something or someone, that you see how much that person, or thing (sight, voice, limb, home, etc.) means to you. </div>
<div>   Blessings come in many forms. It may come in the form of a storm or from a persons generosity. Healing can come to you in tears or through a person's touch. Those sleepless nights and tears we shed are just reminders we are alive and we all have burdens to shoulder. I believe that the pain we feel is just a reminder that this world is not our final resting place. It's not our home. We have somewhere else that is  far better than where we are now. And all the suffering, tears, happiness and love, remind me of this daily; that this life is just a stepping stone to somewhere bigger and better without the trials, tribulations, heartaches and disappointments. Its a place of love, laughter, happiness and peacefulness. Its a place of giving and not receiving. Isn't this what we all want? Isn't this where we all want to be? God has a better place for us. And that is something I remind myself of and I am looking forward to. This isn't all of it. There is something bigger than me. Someone, bigger than me. God is waiting for me. And until my time, I will do what I can to improve myself and become a better person. In any way that the Lord has directed me to. </div>
<div>   But while we are here, at this moment, in this place, why make it harder? Why not help those that need it? Why not give a little of yourself to someone else whether you know them or not? Isn't that what compassion and understanding is? Putting yourself in another person's shoes and walking where they have or are walking now? Ask yourself this...if I were in this situation or,  knew someone that was,  would you want or need help? Would you help them and wouldn't you want all the help you could get? Giving a hand up is an amazing feeling. It's satisfying and is good for the soul. Just to know that you have helped someone. That you may be that blessing in disguise (so to speak) that they needed. To be that person that is willing to lend a helping hand to someone you don't know while standing in the shadows not expecting anything in return except the knowledge that you have helped someone in need. Just the knowing is all the confirmation any of us need or want.</div>
<div>   I don't know Scott or his mother personally. I have only met Scott on Instagram. We are in the same groups and create the same type of art. We talk in our chat groups on LINE. When I found out that his mother had terminal cancer and that he was ill himself, I wanted to help, so I put this fundraiser together. With the generosity of many artist who have donated their work, they too have made this possible.  </div>
<div>   We don't have to know the person that we are helping. All we need to know is their story, their background, their need. All we need to do is listen, hear, understand and help. That is all I am asking of you. Please bless Marilyn, Scott and his family. </div>
<div>   If you are unable to make a financial donation, please make a different donation in the form of a prayer. Please pray for peace, love, understanding, and time. Please pray for quality over quantity. Please pray for their protection, guidance, and for God to ease their pain. To put His healing hand upon their hearts and to help ease their burdens. </div>
<div>   Another way you can help is donating a few minutes of your time by letting your friends and family know about Scott and Marilyn's story. So, if you can, help spread the word and make some noise regarding this campaign/fundraiser. </div>

<h3>Summary </h3>
<p>I'm Stella, and I'm a single mom to five lovely children ranging in age from 5 to 20.  I also happen to suffer from a progressive and terminal lung disease called Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, for which there are no proven treatments other than lung transplant, and sadly, no cure.  Because of my disease, my kids have been exposed to many things that other children don't have to deal with until much later in life, but contrary to what you may initially think? This isn't always a bad thing!  </p>
<p>My daughter is seventeen and coming up on her last year at home before she embarks on her college career, and she is very aware of the need for research where it concerns lung disease and potential treatments.  She's very active athletically in her high school, and when she heard of the Hustle up the Hancock and learned that the proceeds benefit respiratory health and lung reasearch, she immediately urged me to sign her up.  My youngest, the five year old, adores his older sister as only a baby brother can, and when he heard that she was going to run up to the top of that tall building, there was no way he was going to not make her take him along.</p>
<p>We are setting our goal at $2500, which covers the registration and fundraising fees for them both to participate in the Hustle up the Hancock on their very own team, which they have decided will be Team SuperStella.  The remainder (about $95) will go into my gas tank, to transport them to Chicago for the event.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Registration is open for teams, and we need $405 up front in order to register.  The remainder does not have to be raised until March, giving us a little more time and opportunity for fundraising. </p>
<p>The fees and details about the Hustle up the Hancock can be found at Hustleupthehancock.org - We need $265 for Nellie, as the team captain, and $140 for Homer, as a Lung Health Chamion on Team SuperStella.</p>

We fell in love and continued our life together in Massillon, OH. After we came home we wanted to expand our family a little more, we have a 7 year old daughter, Dakota. We went to numerous doctors appointments and were told it was a 1 in a million chance we would get pregnant on our own and if we did we would have to abort because it would be a tubal baby. We were told we couldn't get pregnant without infertility drugs. In Jan 2011 we found out we were pregnant all by God's grace and now we have identical twin boys that were born 9 weeks early on July 14th, 2011. Tanner Owen weighed 3lbs 15oz and our peanut Tyler Austin weighed 2lbs 7oz. It was a very high risk pregnancy and they worried we would even have our children alive. Our sons were born early because of Twin to Twin Transfusion Syndrome Stage 1, which means their amniotic fluid wasn't being shared equally because they were sharing the same placenta. They thought that Tanner has brain damage because of too little fluid and Tyler would have heart failure because of too much fluid. Tyler in the end was the one that was the most worried about. He has a rare disorder that 1 in 3,000-5,000 kids have when they are born called EA/TEF (Esophageal Atresia/Tracheoesophageal Fistula). This means that his esophagus was attached to his trachea by a fistula, allowing stomach acids to go into his lungs. He has now had 3 surgeries to remove fistulas and no has no bottom portion of his esophagus. He has had 3 more surgeries to remove part of his right lower lung because it was so badly damaged, put in a trach because he can't breath on his own, remove 2 hernias, put in 2 broviac IV lines, put in a G-tube because without his esophagus he can't eat like us, and many more procedures. He has to have at least one more surgery to have his esophagus rebuilt. He also has hypothroidism (low thyroid level) which puts him on lifelong meds, pulmonary hypertension, neonatal seizures, vertebrae anomally (wedged vertebrae), and Atrial Septal defect (hole in his heart on the atrial side).

These require a ventilator machine, a back up ventilator for power outages and traveling to and from doctors appointments, humidifier to provide him with humidified oxygen, oxygen concentrator, extra oxygen tanks for mobility, and his feeding machine. Since we live where its cold and power outages happen often we would like to purchase a generator for his medical equipment to stay on even through this. He has also racked up over $1,000,000 in just his first 5 months of life. Since he's in the hospital still currently fighting for his life, these bills will just become greater.

<h3>Amanda Hope’s Story   Our sweet, jovial little girl, Amanda, was 9 years old when she started experiencing severe headaches and flu-like symptoms. Our visits to the pediatrician all had the same outcomes - flu, stomach virus, possible anemia. Finally, just to appease me, her pediatrician pricked her finger. Amand<span class=""text_exposed_hide"">...</span>
</h3>
<div class=""text_exposed_show"">a’s Hemoglobin was only 2.6, which couldn’t be, so he pricked her finger a second time and then a third. He could not believe it was that low so he ordered more blood drawn and sent us home stating he would call when the result where in. Within a few hours, I received a call from her doctor saying ""Mrs. Tallman, I am sorry to tell you Amanda has leukemia and I have a room waiting for her at Phoenix Children’s Hospital. Our lives changed forever in that moment.   I was in shock and disbelief – never had Cancer entered my mind. I remember standing there thinking “Oh My God, there must be a mistake”. I called my husband, telling myself to breath, knowing I must keep it together because my sweet Amanda was just in the next room. I gathered some toys and her favorite blanket, gave her a big hug, and told her that Mommy had to take her to the hospital because her blood was sick and we needed more tests. She cried, “No Mommy, no more needles”. The next few weeks were excruciating because all our family and friends could do was pray for a miracle while we waited for more test results. It was confirmed. Amanda had an advanced form of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and it would require 2½ years of Chemotherapy. And so our battle began.   Sadly, because Amanda's white blood cell counts were so low resulting in numerous infections, the majority of our first 18 months were spent in the hospital. The pain she suffered with endless hours of screaming is a memory I will have forever in my heart. Insane is the only word I can use for the side effects Amanda endured. She started getting stronger, laughing and smiling, our last 18 months being better than the first. Our brave Amanda withstood 3 long years of intense chemotherapy and we were in remission! To celebrate, we had a huge “No More Chemo Party” in March of 2011 that was attended by her family, friends, nurses, and doctors. It was the best day of my life! Amanda started school again with her friends, started back up with her karate lessons, built a Star Wars Lego Battleship with her sister, and found a passion for skateboarding and yoyos. Her “no more chemo” gift was an English Bulldog she named Bruiser who was just like his name! We had studied and looked at English Bulldogs for almost 2 years and he was her dream come true. Our life was finally at peace and I went back to work so we could start to pay off the debt associated with Amanda’s illness. Life was good! On June 23, 2011, Amanda came with me to work for “Bring Your Child to Work” day. She was having a great day; however, after lunch she started getting a headache saying ""Mommy, I don't feel good at all."" By 3:00pm, her pain had increased so I took her to her pediatrician who didn’t find anything and told us to take her home, give her Tylenol, and call if it worsens. About an hour later, the left side of Amanda’s face was paralyzed and she could not swallow. We rushed her to the hospital and our second nightmare began. After a crazy night of doctors, MRI’s, and CAT scans, they informed us she had a mass in her brain that required a biopsy. After hours of waiting, the surgeon came out and told us it looked like cancer and they were running tests on the biopsy. Our world of chemo and radiation began again. Amanda’s two sisters were tested to determine if they were candidates for a bone marrow transplant. Her oldest sister was a perfect match! New Hope. We spend our time preparing for transplant including receiving more chemo and radiation and another surgery to insert a Broviac® port intended for fluids, medications, and blood work during her transplant and recovery – so now we have a Broviac® and another port resulting in 8 to 10 IV lines running from her body almost daily. All this time she kept smiling, praying for other children, patting me on my back telling me “Mommy, everything's going to be okay”. We mourned the loss of her hospital friends along the way and celebrated with those who were still in remission.   A week before her scheduled transplant in January 2012, Amanda's cancer cells mutated. Chemo was like candy and we went from 0.05% cancer to 80% so she was no longer a candidate for transplant. Amanda never gave up hope and always believed in her healing. As one of her doctors said, “Amanda has more Mojo than I have ever seen before”! Amanda fought hard all while making everyone around her smile and laugh. She also had a dream. Amanda’s dream was that one day when she was healed she would make a clothing line for kids going through chemo that would allow them to keep their ""modesty and dignity "". You see, Amanda always hated her body being exposed to a room full of strange doctors, nurses, and others and wanted better for other children.   On March 30, 2012, 11:29am, Amanda Hope lost her battle to Leukemia. Amanda Hope’s Vision: “Comfycozys for Chemo” These special T-shirts are designed with zippers, pockets and slits to allow access to chest-ports without exposing the child’s body and to allow for storing of the IV lines preventing tangling and pulling on their clothing. They are made in the fun, tie-dye colors that Amanda loved so much. Amanda’s spirit of life and integrity of self continues to inspire us all! Her dream is coming true. Five hundred children will receive “Comfycozys for Chemo” T-shirts this Christmas. By next Christmas, our goal is that every child in Arizona who needs a port will receive a “Comfycozys for Chemo” T-shirt from Amanda Hope's Dream. With God's blessing, please touch a child’s life today by supporting this amazing cause! Share Amanda Dream,If possible.. Please sponsor a child for 25.00</div>

You see, Amanda always hated her body being exposed to a room full of strange doctors, nurses, and others and wanted better for other children.   On March 30, 2012, 11:29am, Amanda Hope lost her battle to Leukemia. Amanda Hope’s Vision: “Comfycozys for Chemo” These special T-shirts are designed with zippers, pockets and slits to allow access to chest-ports without exposing the child’s body and to allow for storing of the IV lines preventing tangling and pulling on their clothing. They are made in the fun, tie-dye colors that Amanda loved so much. Amanda’s spirit of life and integrity of self continues to inspire us all! Her dream is coming true. Five hundred children will receive “Comfycozys for Chemo” T-shirts this Christmas. By next Christmas, our goal is that every child in Arizona who needs a port will receive a “Comfycozys for Chemo” T-shirt from Amanda Hope's Dream. With God's blessing, please touch a child’s life today by supporting this amazing cause! Share Amanda Dream,If possible.. Please sponsor a child for 25.00
Please Share Amanda's story, we all know of someone that has battle Cancer. One day at a time, One life at a time we can all make a difference.

On Thursday, August 16th, 2012, a miracle will take place. Eighteen year old Darkori Jovaughn Murphy (Kori for short) will finally be able to do something that few graduates think about.. to walk across the stage and to finally receive his well-deserved high school diploma. It has been a long road leading up to this big day!  <br/><br/>With much persistence and the desire to be better than he was before, on Thursday, August 16, 2012, at 6:30 PM, Drakori Murphy will officially receive his high school diploma from Cedar Hill High School -Performing Arts Center (1 Longhorn Blvd Cedar Hill, TX 75104). The first time around, the family celebrated his big day in the ICU at Baylor with the nurses and staff while he was still in a coma.  This time, Drakori is honored to share his even BIGGER day with everyone as he continue’s to get stronger each day.<br/><br/>On May 19, 2012, the day of his prom, Murphy was one of 3 passengers involved in a fatal car accident that killed his friend, Cornelius Towns, 18, of DeSoto, Texas,.   The 1994 Lexus driven by Evan Thomas Williams, 19, of Cedar Hill drifted off of the roadway, travelled down a grassy embankment on I-20 (Grand Prairie, Texas). <br/><br/>The car became airborne and  travelled some distance before crashing.  Darkori, who was a front seat passenger was pulled out by Williams.<br/><br/>Murphy was airlifted to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas and was in critical condition. Towns and Murphy were seniors at Cedar Hill High School.  Unfortunately, It has been a long road to recovery. Murphy has had to learn how to eat, walk, and to speak again. Taquia Murphy, Darkori’s mother stated, ”that he only had a 10% chance of recovery, and that the situation had been difficult for the family due to his mounting medical bills”.  That day family and friends filled up 2 floors and immediately began to pray.  The prognosis was dire: collapsed lungs, failing kidneys, a broken right leg and left collar bone. Kori was diagnosed with severe traumatic brain injury,with blood &amp; fluid on the brain. Kori had blood transfusions, plastic surgery and a titanium rod inserted in his right leg to replace his crushed right femur bone.<br/><br/>But Takiyah, Darkori's mother, never doubted Kori would live, attributing her strength to faith in God and a host of family and friends (Brent, Willie Murphy,Reginald Thomas, Krandel and Anna Newton, Rev. Clenard and Rosalind Holmes, and Christopher Hawkins, Sr to name a few.) She said, “God just wanted our attention, so they continued to pray with thousands around the country who read Kori's story on Facebook, Twitter, the internet and by word of mouth.<br/><br/>Donavon Murphy, Kori's older brother decided to extend his stay in Texas ( Howard University student) just in case his little brother woke up and needed him. Kori's cousin and best friend, Karrington Ford, also a graduating senior this year, selflessly spent his entire summer helping the team of parents and grandparents care for his cousin. <br/><br/>Kori is one of four children. His sisters Armani and Maiya Murphy as well as Alex Ellis kept Kori entertained by reading to him during his coma and giving him manicures.  The family camped out in the Baylor ICU and BIR, with the parents continued taking turns to spend the night with Kori. <br/><br/>The Miracle<br/><br/>As the hours and days passed, Kori began to defy what the doctors had told the family, with few setbacks. Takiyah said, "" It was like the more people began to pray in earnest, God began to heal Kori faster. I have had the best spiritual journey. Having such a supportive family made the tough days bearable and the good days great.""<br/><br/>The family credits Kori's neurosurgeon, Dr. Doughty, and the ICU team of nurses, respiratory techs, all of which, the family believes were chosen by God to heal Darkori. Kori was in the ICU for 3 weeks before moving on to the Baylor Institute for Rehabilitation in Dallas, under the leadership of Dr. Dubiel and her team.<br/><br/>An avid Graphic Designer, before the accident, Drakori started a clothing line called, FromMeIIYou.  Entrepreneurship has always been a dream of his. He hopes that he can have a full recovery so that he can fulfill his dream. Lost in the accident was his beloved I-Phone 4, computer and his favorite Polo shirt.  We can rest assure that he will be back on top!!<br/>                                                #  #   #</span>

</h3>
<p>My name is John Polnik and I am a 70 year-old, retired tool maker currently residing in Kingman, AZ.  </p>
<p>In 2006 I was diagnosed with
prostate and colon cancer. After twenty-five radiation treatments,
surgeries, and numerous operations I am proud to say that I am a
survivor. <br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, my life was forever changed since I was now
subjected to the indignity of dealing with leakage from both my urostomy and
colostomy bags.  The problem stemmed from the method used for securing the
adhesive skin barrier which acts as buffer between the bag and your body. The
commonly practiced method consists of pressing an awkward, donut-sized sticker
around the stoma with your fingers. It was almost impossible for me to
achieve a flush, airtight seal in this fashion and without that seal, leakage
resulted. So I searched and searched for an applicator. It turned out
that the product I was searching for simply did not exist.  It seemed that
living with the anxiety of worrying about leakage and never feeling comfortable
about leaving my house would ever end.  That is when I decided to utilize
my skills to create a universal skin barrier applicator which would allow me to
live a fuller and more natural lifestyle.  Today, I am proud to say it
works and I currently have a U.S. Patent pending on my device - The Ostomy On.</p>
<p>My dream now is to market this
product to the millions of people worldwide who are currently suffering as I
once did.  The research is staggering.  The most common complaint

</div></div>","My name is John Polnik and I am a 70 year-old, retired tool maker currently residing in Kingman, AZ.  
In 2006 I was diagnosed with
prostate and colon cancer. After twenty-five radiation treatments,
surgeries, and numerous operations I am proud to say that I am a
survivor. 
Unfortunately, my life was forever changed since I was now
subjected to the indignity of dealing with leakage from both my urostomy and
colostomy bags.  The problem stemmed from the method used for securing the
adhesive skin barrier which acts as buffer between the bag and your body. The
commonly practiced method consists of pressing an awkward, donut-sized sticker
around the stoma with your fingers. It was almost impossible for me to
achieve a flush, airtight seal in this fashion and without that seal, leakage
resulted. So I searched and searched for an applicator. It turned out
that the product I was searching for simply did not exist.  It seemed that
living with the anxiety of worrying about leakage and never feeling comfortable
about leaving my house would ever end.  That is when I decided to utilize
my skills to create a universal skin barrier applicator which would allow me to
live a fuller and more natural lifestyle.  Today, I am proud to say it
works and I currently have a U.S. Patent pending on my device - The Ostomy On.
My dream now is to market this
product to the millions of people worldwide who are currently suffering as I
once did.  The research is staggering.  The most common complaint
amongst ostomy bag users is leakage, not from the bag, but from the adhesive
skin barrier which acts as a buffer between the users skin and the bag.  
The Ostomy On can end the suffering
of so many people and change their lives just as it changed mine, but I need
help getting it to them.  I am writing to the IndieGoGo community today
in hopes that I can perhaps find the funding and/or resources to help the

shut-ins because they do not have access to my product.  Please help me to

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Bono was hospitalized twice just after his 3rd birthday in August 2011 and diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis. He was already being treated for Sensory Processing Disorder and was getting therapy 2 times a week. Being raised by a single mother, this put a major financial burder on them. He receives IV infusions every other week at the childrens hospital which takes about 4 hours on average.  He also has to have extra therapies and activities to keep his joints from stiffening. On Thanksgiving, his grandfather was lost to a tragic death by suicide. Being that his mom worked in sales, this too affected them financially. He takes over 30 doses of medication weekly including chemotherapy.  Although his mom thought the worst of their bad luck was over, she was recently fired for taking too much time to care for little Bono.  The family car is in dire need of repairs and that is the transportation to get Bono back and forth to his appointments, therapies and hospital visits.</p>

</p><p>A group of friends from Angeles City, Philippines
are leading a lifetime project, a special one... to save and sustain the life
of one dear friend...</p>
<p><b>WHO IS TAL?<br/></b></p>
<p>Crystaleen Antonio, ""Tal"" to her
close friends and family, is a 30-year old single
mom, working as a public school teacher at Angeles City College in the
Philippines. Tal was diagnosed with renal failure last
November 2013. At the moment, her kidney function remains at a critical
level of only 14%. After 3 separate medical opinions; the doctors recommended that she undergo a kidney transplant
within the next 6 months. </p>
<p><b>WHY TAL NEEDS OUR HELP?<br/></b></p>
<p>The reality is Tal’s salary as a public school teacher at
USD$450 a month, is not even enough to cover her monthly medication and her
basic needs so the cost of the kidney transplant is too overwhelming for her
and her family. </p>
<p>The cost of the transplant operation, medication and
hospitalization for 6 months post-transplant is estimated to reach USD $40,000. This
amount does not cover daily living expenses to cover her basic needs. </p>
<p>Without a kidney donor, this amount will definitely be
higher and the process will be longer. The good news is Tal has a willing
donor, her eldest brother. The next step is for her to start the work-up
procedures to test if her brother’s kidney will match. This process however,
will only start once Tal can show to the National Kidney and Transplant
Institute (Philippines) that she has USD $4,700 in her bank account. </p>
<p><b>HOW IS SHE NOW?<br/></b></p>
<p>Tal is still able to live normally. She still goes to work
daily at the City College of Angeles and she can still perform daily tasks
independently. However, her physical activities and food intake are limited and
must be regulated. She requires monthly medication amounting to USD $520 a month until she is able to afford a transplant.<br/></p>
<p><b>WHERE WILL THE FUNDS GO?<br/></b></p>
<p>Assuming Tal is able to raise enough money for transplant in
the next 4 months, below is the quotation given to her. The amount will cover

<h1>Tourette Syndrome</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hello, my name is Jack Joseph Francis. I am an 18 year old boy from a quiet town called Welwyn Garden City, in England. UK.</li>
<li>I have suffered with Tourette Syndrome for my whole life, though was only diagnosed when I was 11 years old.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a disorder that causes me to make sounds, words (vocal tics) and have body movements (motor tics) that are beyond my control. Tics occur suddenly, may last from several seconds to minutes and have no meaning to myself.<br/></p>
<p>In my words, it is living hell. It is extremely constant and tiring, as well as exceedingly annoying.</p>
<p>Most people with Tourette's syndrome have their own unique type and pattern of tics. Tics come and go over weeks and months. They also change from one type to another. Many people with Tourette's syndrome have episodes of tics that interfere with their daily activities.<br/></p>
<p>I do suffer in life, I don't go out much due to the amount of people staring and giving me odd looks, it's really not nice. Though what I must <i>al</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>ways</i> remember, is that there are people out in this world, so much far worse of than me, I am honestly just happy to be alive, have all my limbs, and healthy!</span></p>
<p>I also suffer with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactive disorder) and OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and <b>extreme </b>anxiety.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)</h3>
<p>Here I explain DBS and the perks and cons of having such surgery.</p>
<p>To go ahead and receive Deep Brain Stimulation, I need to raise at least $35,000. Unfortunately, I and my family are not the kind of people to have that kind of money.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal of $35,000, I will still go ahead and put every single penny of the money I receive towards this surgery, and that's a promise!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

Hello, my name is Jack Joseph Francis. I am an 18 year old boy from a quiet town called Welwyn Garden City, in England. UK.
I have suffered with Tourette Syndrome for my whole life, though was only diagnosed when I was 11 years old.

Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a disorder that causes me to make sounds, words (vocal tics) and have body movements (motor tics) that are beyond my control. Tics occur suddenly, may last from several seconds to minutes and have no meaning to myself.
In my words, it is living hell. It is extremely constant and tiring, as well as exceedingly annoying.
Most people with Tourette's syndrome have their own unique type and pattern of tics. Tics come and go over weeks and months. They also change from one type to another. Many people with Tourette's syndrome have episodes of tics that interfere with their daily activities.
I do suffer in life, I don't go out much due to the amount of people staring and giving me odd looks, it's really not nice. Though what I must always remember, is that there are people out in this world, so much far worse of than me, I am honestly just happy to be alive, have all my limbs, and healthy!
I also suffer with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactive disorder) and OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and extreme anxiety.


Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
Here I explain DBS and the perks and cons of having such surgery.
To go ahead and receive Deep Brain Stimulation, I need to raise at least $35,000. Unfortunately, I and my family are not the kind of people to have that kind of money.
If I do not reach my goal of $35,000, I will still go ahead and put every single penny of the money I receive towards this surgery, and that's a promise!


The Impact
The difference on my life from even such a small contribution would be incredible, every little helps, as they say. I will finally be able to walk the streets without feeling taunted, and humiliated by passers by, I will have a lot more self control of my tic's (that's if I still have them!) And a lot more self esteem. Tourette's really does impact on my life more than you'd think, and if you'd like to know more about it, please Google, 'Tourette Syndrome'.

Updates
$10000 - Official website released
$20000 - More than half of what is needed for the treatment
$35000 - Treatment fully funded thanks to all of you! <3

<p>The answer is simple: most people do not have access to insomnia treatment.</p>

<h2>How Better Sleep works</h2>
<p>Better Sleep uses a no-nonsense, evidence-based approach to insomnia treatment. Specifically, we are using a type of therapy called Cognitive-Behavioral therapy.  The Better Sleep app synthesizes 20 years of insomnia research, using treatments that have been proven to be most effective for insomnia.</p>
<p>With its clean and intuitive interface, Better Sleep provides modern insomnia therapy in a manner that is simple and easy to follow, taking 10 to 15 minutes each day.</p>
<p>Here are some of the features of the Better Sleep app:</p>
<h3>-Insomnia Profile Builder</h3>
<p><strong>Every person’s insomnia is different.</strong> Better Sleep builds a personalized treatment program based on your needs. The app considers a large variety of factors, from your insomnia history, sleeping pills use (if any) and age, to sleep habits to and attitudes towards sleep. Better Sleep updates your treatment program to reflect your progress.</p>
<p><img alt=""Profile"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sleeppics.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/profile.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Profile""/></p>
<h3>-Intelligent Scheduling  </h3>
<p><strong>Automatic scheduling so you always know what to do.</strong> Daily sessions and activities can be done at any time, and take about 10 to 15 minutes in total. Better Sleep is dynamic so it adapts when you skip a session or training activity.</p>
<h3>-Sleep Diary</h3>
<p><strong>Tracks important sleep-related information.</strong> For example, the app automatically calculates sleep efficiency, an excellent measure of how well you are progressing.  The app can also track activities known to affect sleep, helping you become aware of what influences your sleep (and was does not), and to what extent.</p>
<h3>-Relaxation Training</h3>
<p><strong>Relaxation is a skill.</strong> Proper relaxation requires training and is very useful in overcoming insomnia. Dr. Philippe Stenstrom guides you though number of proven relaxation techniques. For example, people who can easily visualize will profit from guided imagery sessions. Others may prefer progressive muscle relaxation. All sessions are guided by Dr. Philippe Stenstrom and recorded in a professional studio.</p>
<p><img alt=""Relaxation"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sleeppics.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/relax.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Relaxation""/></p>
<h3>-Interactive Therapy Sessions</h3>
<p>In these sessions, you will learn new skills to help you overcome insomnia. Includes audio, video and interactive content.</p>
<h3>-Topic Sessions</h3>
<p>Dr. Philippe Stenstrom covers a variety of topics concerning insomnia and how to become a better sleeper.</p>
<p><img alt=""Topic Session"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sleeppics.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/topic.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Topic Session""/></p>
<h3>-Sleep Scheduling</h3>
<p>Sleep Scheduling uses information from your sleep diary, in addition to information you enter concerning your ideal sleep/wake times, to calculate a schedule that limits the time you spend in bed.</p>
<p>This is often considered the “boot camp” of insomnia treatment: it can be challenging at times, but it gives excellent results. An interactive questionnaire will help you determine if this is a good time for you to start this optional procedure.   </p>
<h3>-Support Sessions, Milestones and Progress Reports</h3>
<p>Support sessions and visual representations of your progress will keep you motivated during the course of the therapy.</p>
<h2>Better Sleep needs your support</h2>
<p>Better Sleep is 100% independent and will be supported entirely by users, their friends and families, and donations. </p>
<p>We want to keep Better Sleep free of industry and business investors. This way, all decisions concerning Better Sleep will be made based exclusively on feedback from health practitioners, sleep specialists, sleep researchers, and importantly, those suffering from insomnia. Our only obligation, our only priority, will be to help those suffering from insomnia.  In order to stay independent, we need your help.</p>
<p>After a year of self-funded development, this IndieGoGo project is being launched to get the app through the final stages of production and into the hands of insomnia sufferers around the world. </p>
<p>Better Sleep has the potential to revolutionize insomnia treatment. Accessible, mobile-based therapy for insomnia will help thousands of people suffering from insomnia. With your support, we can make this happen.</p>
<h2>Your Rewards</h2>
<p>To thank you for your support, you will receive the Better Sleep app as soon as it is released (the app can be given as a gift) with a donation of $5. You can get an early release of the app, before it is available to the public, with a donation of $10 or more. A donation of $20 or more will immortalize your name on the app and on the Better Sleep web site.<br/></p>
<p>Larger contributions will get you some truly unique perks, such as personalized guided imagery recordings and one-on-one therapy sessions with Dr. Philippe Stenstrom over Skype or phone.</p>
<h2>Maximizing accessibility</h2>
<p>Here are some of the ways we are trying to get Better Sleep to as many people as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Computers:</strong> For those without mobile phones, we are developing a Better Sleep program adapted for personal computers (PC and Mac). While desktop computers do not have some of the advantages of mobile phones, all essential features of the treatment program are present.</p>
<p><strong>More Languages</strong>: Better sleep is currently being developed in English and French.</p>
<p>In line with our objective of accessible insomnia treatment, funds beyond $14,000 will go towards translating the app into as many languages as possible, starting with Japanese, Chinese, Spanish and Russian.</p>
<h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2>
<p>-When will Better Sleep be released?</p>
<p>Better Sleep will be released October 2013.</p>
<p>-How long does the therapy last?</p>
<p>The treatment program lasts around 4 to 5 weeks, depending on the participant’s progress and the initial severity and persistence of insomnia symptoms.</p>
<p>-How much time will the therapy take daily?</p>
<p>Most people should expect to spend about 10 to 15 mins per day on therapy-related activities.</p>
<p>-I do not have a smart phone. Can I still use Better Sleep?</p>
<p>Better Sleep will be available on desktops and laptops that use Windows, and Macs.</p>
<p>-Does the app replace a sleep psychologist?</p>
<p>The best treatment for insomnia is a sleep psychologist. We created Better Sleep because most people do not have access to a sleep psychologist.</p>
<p>-Will this app cure my insomnia?</p>
<p>Better Sleep will significantly reduce the severity of your insomnia.  It is important to have realistic expectations. Never having insomnia ever again is not a realistic objective, because most people experience insomnia from time to time. Getting restful sleep on most nights is a realistic objective. Better Sleep will help you reach that objective.</p>
<p>-Is this app only for people suffering from chronic insomnia?</p>
<p>This app can help anyone to sleep better. The app will benefit “good sleepers” by reducing event-triggered insomnia sometimes caused by such things as pain (injury, surgery, etc.) and anxiety (evaluations, stressful life events, etc.). Better Sleep’s insomnia profile builder will propose a program specifically tailored to a “good sleeper’s” specific concerns and objectives.</p>

</a><br/><h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3><p><strong>What inspired Dr. Scheier to enter the business side of the dental world and invent the EVOLVE Toothbrush? </strong>
<br/>
Dr. Scheier was inspired by frustrations in seeing his patients having difficulty cleaning their teeth, especially at and below the gum line, which can lead to periodontal disease. 
<br/>
After many years practicing dentistry it became clear to Dr. Scheier that dental care technology needed to evolve. He believes there needs to be an easy-to-use solution that helps people brush their teeth and gums more thoroughly. It is Dr. Scheier’s observation that “most toothbrushes are little more than bristles on a stick” and he is concerned that studies show that most people neglect at least one key area while brushing.
<br/><br/><strong>What makes the EVOLVE Toothbrush different from other toothbrushes?</strong>
<br/>
It is a manual toothbrush with moving parts. Patented triple flexing action makes it effortless to clean multiple surfaces of teeth, simultaneously, especially at and below the gum line. 
<br/>
The center and outer bristles heads are embedded in an elastic membrane. This enables the outer bristles to flex in and grab the tooth at the gum line, when gentle pressure of the center head is applied to teeth. Because of this unique design, users can clean multiple surfaces of their teeth and gums at the same time, with minimal effort.
<br/>
Its ergonomic design makes it easy for people living with compromised conditions and varying abilities, such as Arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Muscular Dystrophy and Cerebral Palsy to not only easily clean their teeth, but also effectively clean areas of their gums, where inflammation and gum disease can form.
<br/><br/><strong>How is the EVOLVE Toothbrush better than other brushes?</strong>
<br/>
The EVOLVE Toothbrush has been proven in laboratory testing at the University of Pennsylvania to be superior at cleaning at and below the gum line vs. other best-selling manual and power brushes on the market. 
<br/><br/><strong>How did Dr. Scheier come up with the brand name?</strong><br/>
By using the EVOLVE Toothbrush to clean teeth and gums, consumer thinking would “EVOLVE” from the old fashioned technology of toothbrushes “bristles on a stick” to his new, innovative triple flexing technology.
 <br/><br/><strong>How did Dr. Scheier come up with the design of the EVOLVE Toothbrush?</strong>
<br/>
The design inspiration actually came about when Dr. Scheier’s wife was playing with their beautiful St. Bernard, Bridget. She had a toy ball that was covered with fingerlike projections. When Bridget bit down on the ball, the projections bent in to grab her teeth. The idea for EVOLVE's flexing technology was born.
<br/><br/><strong>How can the EVOLVE Toothbrush help transform an oral health routine?</strong>
<br/>
It has been medically recognized that there is a link between gum disease and systemic diseases and conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, stroke, complications in pregnancy and even some forms of cancer. Because the EVOLVE Toothbrush makes it effortless and more precise to clean teeth and gums, users of the brush will improve their oral as well as overall health and well-being. 
<br/>
It helps make brushing teeth and gums a no brainer of sorts – “the EVOLVE Toothbrush is a smart brush that knows exactly what to do even if you don’t.”
 <br/><br/><strong>Where can individuals go to buy the EVOLVE Toothbrush?</strong>
<br/>
For the time being only on Indiegogo. The EVOLVE campaign is to secure capital to build production molds for the toothbrush. 
<br/>
After that, the EVOLVE Toothbrush will be available for purchase online and hopefully in selected specialty stores.</p></div>","Isn't it time you started using something better than bristles on a stick to clean your teeth and gums?We think so.We have created something really special.

<h3 style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: normal; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Hi, my name is Vick (34yrs old). I am a self employed driving instructor living and working in London UK. <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">And as many of you at my age, I only have one living parent; my mother died of stage 4 ovarian cancer which spread to her brain in 2009.</span>
</h3>
<p style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">This campaign is an attempt to raise funds to cover the substantial medical costs (including an air ambulance service use) incurred over the last six weeks (Just before Christmas 2014) for my dad who has tragically suffered a very serious injury to his spinal column, leaving him without the use of his arms and legs and currently on a ventilator to keep him alive.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">My dad (Danny, a UK citizen for 40yrs and only 66yrs old) has recently been flown back to the UK after <b>being diagnosed with quadriplegia (no use of arms or legs)</b>.<br/>He flew to his place of birth (Mauritius) to visit his very sick mother and to deal with some paperwork. His trip was to be short (only 8 days).<br/><br/>After a sleep, on his first day there after a tiring 14 hour flight he woke and got up from bed and fainted.<br/>When he fell <b>he fractured his spine and compressed his spinal column</b> from his neck down through the vertebrae that deals with his respiratory system.<br/><br/>2 hours before being discovered his condition worsened and deteriorated further during the additional 2 hours it took for the ambulance to arrive.<br/>After being <b>neglected in a state hospital for 5 days unwashed and uncared for</b> his brother had him transferred to a private clinic while he still had a small amount of dignity left.<br/><br/>An operation was performed (at the private clinic) however, <b>this operation should have taken place within 6 hours of the accident and by now was 6 days overdue</b><i>.</i><br/>At this point his respiratory system started to fail and he was put on a ventilator to breathe for him.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">By now <b>the operation (£20,000) was more about saving his life than it was to treat his quadriplegia</b> and while saving his life was a success, the chances of recovering from this condition have become very slim. </p>
<p style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">We (my brother and I) initially paid daily for the hospital (approx £1,000 a day), staff and all medical equipment which amounted to around £65,000. <br/><b>Much of dad's life savings will have paid for the bulk of the costs because, unfortunately he had not taken out travel insurance.</b> As you can see the costs incurred are huge.<br/>My dad does not have a living will <b>(nobody expects the worse I guess)</b> so the stress involved trying to access his life savings and pension was beyond anything I could have ever expected. This tragedy became all about paying the bills and having no time to care for and be there to support my dad in his time of need.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">We tried so hard to get him transported to the UK as quickly as possible and into our free health care system but, <b>we came up against obstacles at every turn</b>.<br/></p>

<p style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b>There was a commercial flight option which is what we finally managed to achieve</b> (costing £25,000), <b>after overcoming many obstacles and jumping through hoops.</b><br/>First of all the only airline to fly nonstop and has the capability of transporting a stretcher case is Air Mauritius however, their list of approved medical equipment was a decade out of date and they would not approve the UK medical team's equipment on board.</p>
<p style=""color: rgb(42, 42, 42); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><b>A doctor from the private clinic went beyond the call of duty and arranged meetings with Air Mauritius and the flight regulatory commission and got them to accept and approve the updated list of equipment and not just a temporary measure for my dad, but for all future cases!</b> <br/>Now all of this took many weeks, we were taking time off from work and my brother had to leave his 18 month old son at home while we traveled across the world to help arrange things in a developing Third World country where things are very slow moving.</p>

</div></div>","A family friend had a life changing accident that has effected his family forever. I had been  wanting to do something to try to help raise awareness and some much needed funds to help them. 

I have been considering donating my hair to the little princesses trust for some time now, they are a fantastic charity who make wigs for children with cancer. 
I am going to have my hair cut the 25th March 2015.
So I thought I would set this page up to try help both good causes.
 Please if you you can donate anything or share this page your help and kindness will be so greatly appreciated. 



Here is Danny's story written by his son: 

Hi, my name is Vick (34yrs old). I am a self employed driving instructor living and working in London UK. And as many of you at my age, I only have one living parent; my mother died of stage 4 ovarian cancer which spread to her brain in 2009.

This campaign is an attempt to raise funds to cover the substantial medical costs (including an air ambulance service use) incurred over the last six weeks (Just before Christmas 2014) for my dad who has tragically suffered a very serious injury to his spinal column, leaving him without the use of his arms and legs and currently on a ventilator to keep him alive.
My dad (Danny, a UK citizen for 40yrs and only 66yrs old) has recently been flown back to the UK after being diagnosed with quadriplegia (no use of arms or legs).He flew to his place of birth (Mauritius) to visit his very sick mother and to deal with some paperwork. His trip was to be short (only 8 days).After a sleep, on his first day there after a tiring 14 hour flight he woke and got up from bed and fainted.When he fell he fractured his spine and compressed his spinal column from his neck down through the vertebrae that deals with his respiratory system.2 hours before being discovered his condition worsened and deteriorated further during the additional 2 hours it took for the ambulance to arrive.After being neglected in a state hospital for 5 days unwashed and uncared for his brother had him transferred to a private clinic while he still had a small amount of dignity left.An operation was performed (at the private clinic) however, this operation should have taken place within 6 hours of the accident and by now was 6 days overdue.At this point his respiratory system started to fail and he was put on a ventilator to breathe for him.
By now the operation (£20,000) was more about saving his life than it was to treat his quadriplegia and while saving his life was a success, the chances of recovering from this condition have become very slim. 
We (my brother and I) initially paid daily for the hospital (approx £1,000 a day), staff and all medical equipment which amounted to around £65,000. Much of dad's life savings will have paid for the bulk of the costs because, unfortunately he had not taken out travel insurance. As you can see the costs incurred are huge.My dad does not have a living will (nobody expects the worse I guess) so the stress involved trying to access his life savings and pension was beyond anything I could have ever expected. This tragedy became all about paying the bills and having no time to care for and be there to support my dad in his time of need.
We tried so hard to get him transported to the UK as quickly as possible and into our free health care system but, we came up against obstacles at every turn.
At first he wasn't stable enough for flight because of the amount of oxygen needed to keep him alive and the use of dopamine aboard a flight is prohibited.When stable an air ambulance was possible but would have cost in excess of £75,000 something that was beyond our budget even with access to my dads life savings.
There was a commercial flight option which is what we finally managed to achieve (costing £25,000), after overcoming many obstacles and jumping through hoops.First of all the only airline to fly nonstop and has the capability of transporting a stretcher case is Air Mauritius however, their list of approved medical equipment was a decade out of date and they would not approve the UK medical team's equipment on board.
A doctor from the private clinic went beyond the call of duty and arranged meetings with Air Mauritius and the flight regulatory commission and got them to accept and approve the updated list of equipment and not just a temporary measure for my dad, but for all future cases! Now all of this took many weeks, we were taking time off from work and my brother had to leave his 18 month old son at home while we traveled across the world to help arrange things in a developing Third World country where things are very slow moving.
My dad is now back in the UK, it has been a week now (1st Feb 2015) and is receiving NHS care. We have all but depleted my dads accounts and are looking into selling his house to help cover costs.
We are not sure what future care will look like and I am hoping that some of you reading this might be able to help us with information regarding ongoing treatment and rehabilitation and possibly the funding of such services.  I am assuming that we will eventually need equipment to transport him and a place for him to live that has been adapted for his condition.
For those of you not able to contribute financially, maybe you know people that can help? He needs a specialised hospital bed in a hospital able to deal with his condition (dad is currently in a general hospital ICU). Maybe you know a surgical consultant who can check his condition and maybe make suggestions to us, the family? Or anything else that you can think of that might help.
If this campaign is not for you, I understand but please take something away with you that we learnt the hard way. Always, always get travel insurance! It may seem simple but you never know and it's a very small cost in comparison if the worse does happen. Also you may have a WILL all ready to go in the case of your death but, get a LIVING WILL! this will help those family members in a situation if you are rendered incapable of moving and talking.
Finally, thank you for increasing awareness of our situation, and all help given. We are eternally grateful.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

As their website states, hospice is about celebrating life and quality of living--something in which Elaine, myself, and my family firmly believe. I miss Elaine deeply and constantly--and in an effort to turn some of that grief outward, give back to those who helped our family during this difficult time, and ensure that such end-of-life services are available to those going forward, I will be running the Whidbey Half Marathon on April 13th, 2014, in Elaine's memory and with the goal of raising funds and awareness for hospice care. Funding & LogisticsMy goal is to raise $100 for every mile I run. All money raised will go directly to the Dr. Bob Kemp Hospice House in Hamilton, Ontario in Elaine's name. I encourage you to read more about their services here.If you are interested in the course I will be running, you can find details about the event here. I will make sure to update you all on the race and day-of events. I will be running with my partner and a handful of dear friends. Laughter, reflection, mud-covered shoes, and a few tears are definites, as are lots of photographs. I look forward to sharing the experience with you all, and most importantly, holding Elaine with me as I run what promises to be a beautiful course. Other Ways You Can HelpIn lieu of monetary donations, I happily accept well-wishes or a pause in your day to take a minute to tell those around you that they are appreciated and loved. The last time I saw Elaine, she was dancing down her street back toward her home. She truly both lived and loved her life and took time to pause and reflect on the little things. If nothing else, I encourage you all to do the same.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>This idea if successful could emerge as an entire system of training and movement therapy with unprecedented speed and efficiency! This system may then eventually become a new academy that people around the world could study and bring to their communities, and lives all over will be the better for it!</div> </div> <div> <h3>A project for health and happiness</h3> <p>For years, I've participated in leading edge academies such as the CHEK Institute, NASM, the Yuen Method, and more. Each of these wonderful schools of thought have helped thousands if not millions across the world; each of these schools also have a very unique approach to fitness, health and well-being.</p>
<p>I could see the individual pieces in my mind scattered about.

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I have seen and worked with so many people that are needlessly in pain or are living a lesser quality of life on account of body image issues or restrictions in their movement.

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> The truth is, I'm operating on an inspired thought and a theory that to my knowledge hasn't been tested before. Is there a risk to that? Of course... I could go through all the motions to try to pioneer something great, and ultimately have no ""Swiss army knife"" at the end of it all... But in the name of optimism, I'd still have exceptional tools that can help many people in familiar ways. That's the goal here, help people.</p>
<p>I've been in the industry long enough to know many people more brilliant than I. I won't be alone in this!

<p>On August 23rd, I took to the waters in an attempt to swim from Europe to Africa by crossing the Strait of Gibraltar, in what was ultimately a 15.5 mile swim (due to shifting currents). I am proud to join the ranks of the fewer than <a href=""http://www.acneg.com/acneg%20ingles/One%20way.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">400</a> swimmers who successfully crossed the Strait without a wetsuit, but more importantly, I am proud that this symbolic journey has helped to raise funds for <a href=""http://www.voicesofrwanda.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Voices of Rwanda</a>.</p>

<p>Blue Ridge Bread Company is the culmination of ten years worth
of planning and dreaming by Chef Rob Marsh who is a graduate of Johnson &amp; Wales University, and Mr. Kevin Hager.</p>
<p>Blue Ridge Bread Co opened its doors in July of 2014.
Since then, we have rapidly grown in local popularity (Check out our <a href=""http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g49108-d6764537-Reviews-Blue_Ridge_Bread_Company-Elkin_North_Carolina.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tripadvisor Ranking and Reviews</a>, currently ranked 4th of 38). Our baked goods are
currently carried at several local retailers in the Elkin/Jonesville Area. Our
use of Old World technique, and local organic ingredients, as well as our
refusal to incorporate chemicals into our products have supplied our customers with
a sought after niche of products that, until now, had been missing in the area. </p><p>      When we decided to open BRBC, we had access to just enough capital to buy the
essentials: a woodblock table, 3 bay sink, handwash sink, refrigerator,
freezer, oven ($250 on Craig's list), etc. (our oven capacity being the weakest link in our bakery’s
production line: 12 loaves at a time). We have operated the last few months at peak production
levels and, after doggedly trying to work around it (plus several unforseeable circumstances), have come to the stark
conclusion that we must ask for outside help to expand in order to survive. </p><p>      We have been continually approached
by prospective larger volume wholesale customers, but do not currently have near
the production capacity to take them on, nor do our current wholesale accounts bring enough to sustain us. With your support, we will have the
opportunity to purchase a new oven (approximate capacity ~76 loaves) so that we may take on these new accounts
thereby securing our ability to not only increase our overall production level
exponentially, but also become 100% self sufficient. With the purchase of the
new oven comes the opportunity for us to take on multiple wholesale accounts,
become self-sustaining, as well as pave the way for a small retail location in
Elkin.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>$1500 of campaign contributions will go directly to the
initial purchase of our new (used) oven.</p>

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We believe that local food production is key to addressing
the global food shortage we now face as human beings. Mass production processes
strip vital nutrition out of commercially available bread and baked goods. With
these things in mind, we hope to continue providing delicious, nutritious,
bread and baked goods in the Yadkin Valley region and soon, up and down the
entire Blue Ridge Corridor.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Our greatest challenge in the short term is securing enough working capital to enable us to survive until we can install our new oven and
get our new accounts on a consistent order-payment schedule. By increasing our
production capabilities we will be able to avoid this scenario repeating itself
again in the near future. With the production increase we will also be able to
produce enough to begin pursuing a small retail location where we will offer
not only our Artisan breads and baked goods, but also sandwiches, cold
desserts, and espresso. By securing a retail location, we will no longer be
quite so dependent on our wholesale accounts and can supply a much needed face
to our company. Regardless of whether we meet our goal, we will not give up.
BRBC has come this far, and we are not done yet.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We understand that most people these days have limited
finances, as we are in the same predicament. If you find that you feel
passionately about our cause, but don’t have the means to contribute
monetarily, there are other ways to support us. A Facebook share or a quick Tweet
cost nothing but go a long way to spread the word. Tell your friends and
neighbors in person as well. Indigogo makes it easy to share our campaign.

entire Blue Ridge Corridor.
Risks & Challenges
Our greatest challenge in the short term is securing enough working capital to enable us to survive until we can install our new oven and
get our new accounts on a consistent order-payment schedule. By increasing our
production capabilities we will be able to avoid this scenario repeating itself
again in the near future. With the production increase we will also be able to
produce enough to begin pursuing a small retail location where we will offer
not only our Artisan breads and baked goods, but also sandwiches, cold
desserts, and espresso. By securing a retail location, we will no longer be
quite so dependent on our wholesale accounts and can supply a much needed face
to our company. Regardless of whether we meet our goal, we will not give up.
BRBC has come this far, and we are not done yet.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a Licensed Professional Counselor that specializes in Anxiety and Depression (I am also a Certified Clinical Anxiety Treatment Professional).  I have a Masters Degree in Counseling and spent time as a lead therapist on an inpatient self harm/suicide unit helping people manage their anxiety and depression and get on the road to recovery.  I am further refining and developing the best recovery program for anxiety and depression that I personally developed while helping 1000s of people.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606835292/u1festco8f63y7zbib5e.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The program will include 15 very practical video sessions along with a workbook.  I have been using the skills that you will learn in this program as a professional counselor for years with great success.  I have run small group sessions as well as individual sessions to help 1,000s of people with anxiety and depression using the latest evidence based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy techniques (many that were developed and refined by me that you won't find anywhere else!)  to help you ""Retrain Your Brain"" and eliminate the debilitating symptoms.</p>

<p>This project is important to me as I have had personal struggles in the past with anxiety.  After my recovery I spent time as a professional magician (I appeared on Season 4 of Penn and Teller Fool Us in Las Vegas) and continue to speak to groups of 1,000+...doing things I never believed I would have been able to do when I was in the grips of anxiety.  And I am 100% sure you will be able to reach your dreams as well!  My ultimate goal is to provide this program free of charge to those who need it and impact lives for generations to come.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let's start with the important question --- <strong>Will this program help you or a loved one? </strong> Absolutely!  How can I be so sure?  After using these skills and techniques I have developed with 1,000s of clients there is a 100% positive change reported in pre and post program scores on how much anxiety and/or depression is affecting his/her daily living.  That means 100% of people who have learned these skills and engaged with the sessions have been helped and so will you!!!</p>

<p>I have had an outline of all 15 session for many years.  I have been walking people through the program individually and in small groups and seeing tremendous success - the average score of someone prior to beginning the program on how much anxiety or depression negatively affects their day-to-day living was 8.7 out of 10 --- the average score after learning the skills and changing their thought patterns just a few months later dropped all the way down to a 2.3!  </p>

<p>This program will include all 15 sessions on video as well as a workbook on a private password protected site that will be sent to you to go through on your home computer or television.  I am currently in the process of doing final revisions on the workbook (it will be around 50-60 pages and help you follow along with the video sessions).  I plan to have it professionally designed into PDF form that you can either print or type notes in electronically.  I am also preparing to video tape all 15 sessions that will be very practical and give you the skills you need.  Each session you will learn 1 specific skill (breathing, mindfulness, exercise, etc) that will totally change the way you feel (so you will have 15 new things to make you feel great at the end!) as well as a specific topic each week that plays a role in anxiety and depression and by the end of the program you will know exactly where your anxiety or depression is stemming from and the steps to make a total change and find freedom and victory!  Here are the sessions that are covered in the program:</p>
<p>Session 1             Introduction to Anxiety and Depression</p>
<p>Session 2              Dealing with Panic Attacks</p>
<p>Session 3              Better But Believable Thoughts</p>
<p>Session 4              Dealing with the Shoulds</p>
<p>Session 5              Healthy Diet and Exercise</p>
<p>Session 6              Spiritual Health</p>

<p>In addition to resolving pain from these specific injuries, the
DCT ProFlex is used by everyone from <b>Professional and Elite Athletes</b> looking
for the cutting edge in performance, to <b>Seniors</b> wanting to
improve their quality of life.  No matter where you lie on the health
continuum, DCT and the ProFlex will help you take control of your body, and
show you that it's possible to live both pain free and achieve superior levels
of performance. </p>
<b>Dynamic Contraction
Technique</b>, or <b>DCT</b>,
is a flexibility system that uses sequential muscle contractions to actively
balance tension, remove scar tissue, and ultimately improve muscle function and
strength. The DCT ProFlex is a leverage device that fastens to your foot
allowing users to perform DCT exercises and immediately improve blood
circulation, range of motion, and posture. This is truly the first easy to
learn, efficient, and powerfully effective therapeutic exercise system and
device on the market.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175423/files/20131104153515-FeaturesHeader-25.jpg?1383608115"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175424/files/20131104153541-specs-26.png?1383608141"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p>

<p><span style=""text-align: center;"">“I was introduced to Dynamic Contraction Technique (DCT) in April 2005, since then I have worked with Nic Bartolotta to create a flexibility program that best suits me.  DCT has helped me to prepare in a way that I know I am physically ready for anything.  The work is truly amazing, light years ahead of many of the other protocols commonly used in most athletic and fitness programs today.”  <span><br/></span></span><span style=""text-align: center;""> </span></p>

The true secret to
the ProFlex lies in understanding the biomechanics of the ankle.  There is
a common misconception that the Ankle joint operates like the hinge joint of a
door.  A door hinge has a single axis of motion and a stable pivot point
that the door swings around.  The knee and elbow joints are examples of
hinge joints in the body.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175491/files/20131104155135-knee_1.png?1383609095"" src="""" style=""width: 300.52669039145906px; height: 182px;""/>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175492/files/20131104155150-elbow_1.png?1383609110"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 212.86764705882354px; height: 193px;""/></p>
<p>But unlike a simple hinge joint, the ankle has 3 different axes
of motion creating a pivot point that actually moves in an arc when you point
and flex your foot.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175497/files/20131104155239-ankle_1.png?1383609159"" src="""" style=""width: 220.16722408026757px; height: 227px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175498/files/20131104155257-ankle_2.png?1383609177"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em; width: 344.396px; height: 209px;""/></p>
This fact, now obvious
to you, has actually been overlooked by most designers when creating
rehabilitation and strength training devices for the lower leg and
ankle. <b>If you design a product for the human foot that works
about a stable hinge joint then you lose out on 75% of the motion of the ankle
and can cause poor muscle recruitment, improper movement patterns, or even
injury.</b><br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175503/files/20131104155432-rotate_1.jpg?1383609272"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If you look at the ProFlex in operation you can see very clearly
that the device <b>allows for full and complete motion of the ankle around
its moving pivot point.</b>  Unlike any other device on the market the
ProFlex allows for controlled resistance along each independent axes of motion
making it a superior rehabilitation tool for ankle sprains and fracture
recovery (show Supination and pronation and inversion eversion). </p>
<p>This scientific breakdown of ankle and foot motion also gives
the ProFlex an unparalleled ability to strengthen muscles and connective tissue
that directly re-enforces proper foot mechanics and posture.</p>

<p>In order to make sure you get the most out of your ProFlex we've
created an education program and resources that are as effective as they are

found that if people can feel a significant change in their body in 10 minutes
or less, they're more likely to be consistent with their training.  As
such, both our individualized workouts, called TuneUps, and our assisted
therapy sessions are all designed to be highly focused and intense so that you
get the most out of your time.</p>

<p>As you learn and perfect each individual DCT exercise, we teach
you how to stack the exercises into proprietary <b>DCT Progressions</b> that
utilize muscle recruitment and activation of each consecutive exercise to
generate the maximum strength and stretch from a specific muscle group or line
of fascia (connective tissue).</p>
<p>For Therapists and Trainers learning to use the ProFlex with
their clients, the <b>DCT Progressions</b>allow them to blend this work
into existing workout plans or treatment protocols seamlessly.</p>

<p>Developed over the past 13 years, Dynamic Contraction Technique,
also called DCT, is a highly evolved form of an existing corrective exercise
therapy known as “resistance stretching.”  Unlike traditional passive
stretching methods, resistance stretching uses muscle contractions to actively
release excess tension and balance the pressure across your joints.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/177435/files/20131105100927-DCT_ProFlex_V5-2.jpeg?1383674967"" src="""" style=""width: 275.224px; height: 155px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175541/files/20131104160633-muscle_1.jpg?1383609993"" src="""" style=""width: 278.205px; height: 155px;""/><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The secret to radical health benefits that have previously gone
untapped lies specifically in the use of the eccentric muscle
contraction.  An eccentric muscle contraction is achieved only when a
muscle remains contracted while being lengthened at the same time (also known
as “negatives” in weight training).  </p>
<p>Because you are contracting the muscle as you lengthen it, you
build <b>strength</b> and <b>range of motion</b> simultaneously,
immediately improving both posture and blood circulation.  By establishing
proper posture, we are able to isolate the root cause of an injury and create
the needed change in movement and muscle recruitment for perfect and
sustainable function.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175547/files/20131104160827-posture.jpg?1383610107"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Dynamic Contraction Technique embraces this principal of
cultivating strength throughout a muscle's full range of motion and is helping
redefine our notions of what it means to stretch and be flexible.  The DCT
ProFlex is the first product ever developed to utilize this groundbreaking
method. </p>
<p>Due to the incredible torque created by the ankle joint, as well
as the remarkable strength of the calf and shin muscles, it is impossible to
facilitate an eccentric muscle contraction without assistance.  There
simply is not enough leverage to overpower the muscles that cross the ankle
joint and adequately perform a DCT exercise. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/175550/files/20131104160907-patent_ribbon_-27.jpg?1383610147"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And so it was out of basic necessity that the DCT ProFlex was
created.  While the concept is simple, in reality, the ProFlex boasts a
novelty and uniqueness in function that earned us a full Utility Patent from
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in September of 2012!</p>

crisis we have ever known.  Some 80
million people, around 43% of America's working-age adults, didn't go to the
doctor or access other medical services last year because of the cost.  But cost is not the only factor that has led
to a reactive attitude towards health and wellness in our nation.  We have been conditioned from childhood that
“if it aint broke, don’t fix it,” and we take this to heart when it comes to
our bodies.  There is a flawed perception
that our body should operate as we demand without the slightest attention paid to it
at all.  Unfortunately, pain is
historically our greatest motivator, and catastrophic injury is typically the
only thing serious enough to get us to change our behaviors and upgrade our lifestyle
choices. </p>
<p>However, we now stand at a crossroads in Healthcare
where financially and physically we cannot afford to be complacent about the
aspects of Health and Wellness that we can actually control.  As healthcare costs and insurance premiums
steadily rise, a dramatic shift is taking place where people are stepping back
and choosing to proactively address avoidable health conditions and
injuries.  And until recently, most
proactive and preventative measures of Healthcare have come with a large price
tag making them unavailable to the masses.

<p>At the end of the campaign we will send you
a link to a page with a form to fill out where you can choose the correct size
of the ProFlex for yourself or for your clients.  You will also be given the color options for
the board and foot strap at this time.  For
the Limited Edition Aluminum ProFlex you will be asked to provide the name with
the exact spelling you would like engraved onto the device.  If you are buying multiple ProFlexes you will
be sent a link to separate form for each one you purchased.  </p>
<p><b>2.  </b><b>What are you going to do with the money you
raise?</b></p>
<p>Once our campaign ends we will make your
ProFlex or ProFlexes and ship them to you as quickly as possible.  Any additional funds raised will go towards
continued production and expansion of the current product to include an XL version
for size 14.5 feet and up (currently XL is only available as a custom order), more
TuneUp Videos (and other educational materials), as well as some additional
product features that were cost prohibitive to test during the original
prototyping process.</p>
<p><b>3.  </b><b>When do I get my ProFlex?</b></p>
<p>Our manufacturing partners are standing by
and excited to start producing the ProFlex. 
As soon as our campaign ends, they will get to work.  We have been given a 60 day lead time from
our manufacturers, and allowing for roughly 15 days to receive the funds we
raised we can expect to have the ProFlex delivered to you within 3 months after
the end of the campaign.  To expedite the
process we will ship the products as they come off the production line which
means if you are an early adopter and are one of the first to order the ProFlex
then you will be one of the first to receive it! </p>
<p><b>4.  </b><b>What sizes do the ProFlex come in?  How do I know my size?</b></p>
<p>The ProFlex is currently offered in two
different sizes based off of standard US shoe sizing:</p>
<p>Youth/Womens (Size 8.5 and below in Womens/Youth US sizes)</p>
<p>Mens (Size 7 - 12.5 in Mens US sizes; 9 and up in Womens/Youth US sizes)</p>
<p>The ergonomics of the ProFlex strap
accommodate for differences in the width and height of your foot.  We have found that the most important
measurement for picking the proper size of the ProFlex is your foot
length.  If you have 14.5 and up sized
feet you can still purchase the ProFlex through the campaign, but there may be
an additional fee assessed once we complete the campaign.  However, if we receive enough XL requests and
pre-sell enough units overall we may be able to incorporate the XL version into
our offerings and waive the fee!  For
more details on the XL size please email us directly at <a href=""mailto:info@dctproducts.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@dctproducts.com</a>.  </p>
<p><b>5.  </b><b>How old do you need to be to safely use the
ProFlex? Can my kids use it?  For that
matter can my parents/grandparents use it?</b></p>
<p>If you have a previous condition or concern
relative to your ability to perform DCT exercises or use the ProFlex be sure to
consult with your physician before using this device and syste.  That being said, the ProFlex can be used with
a very wide range of ages, 8 years old to 90+ years old.  The real determining factor is coordination
and proper sensation.  With children
under the age of 10 better results are had when being facilitated by a licensed
Therapist or certified Personal Trainer who can help them keep their attention
focused on the activity.  Depending on
the coordination of the child the bottom limit in age appears to be 8 years
old.  Teenagers and adults are able to
very successfully perform the DCT TuneUps on their own, but can certainly
benefit greatly from receiving assisted DCT ProFlex sessions from a Therapist
or Trainer.  With Seniors the limitation
in use stems from chronic injuries, overall strength and conditioning, and
impaired sensation.  Determining a
specific upper age limit for the ProFlex is difficult, but in general if an
elderly person has difficulty getting up and down from the floor then they will
do better using the ProFlex with a Therapist or Trainer certified in the DCT
ProFlex and who specializes with Seniors. 
However, if cleared by their doctor and able to easily lay on the floor
for exercise then the ProFlex will be of extremely beneficial to a Senior.  We have had 91 year olds attend DCT group
classes in San Diego with great success!</p>
<p><b>6.  </b><b>What is the difference between the
Therapist &amp; Trainer Perks and the regular Perks?</b></p>
<p>The difference between the Perks is in the
type of education materials provided with the purchase of the ProFlex.  As a Therapist or Trainer we will teach you
both how to do assisted (hands on) DCT exercises with your clients as well as
how to use the ProFlex by yourself so that you can teach your clients how to
use it on their own.  The Perks that
offer extra education packages include live webinar events where you will learn
how to perfect using the ProFlex and be able to ask questions and see live
demonstrations.</p>
<p><b>7.  </b><b>I forgot to include the additional fee for
the Intermediate Education Package Upgrade, what should I do?</b></p>
<p>If you do not include the additional fee to
your contribution, not to worry, just make a new contribution via Indiegogo for
the additional fee, and then email your original order confirmation and the
additional fee confirmation to: <a href=""sales@dctproducts.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sales@dctproducts.com</a> Keep in mind that it is only necessary to pay the additional fee once, so if
you are buying multiple units you do not need to include the extra fee.</p>
<p><b>8.  </b><b>If I am a Therapist or Trainer should buy
both the small and large versions of the ProFlex?  </b></p>
<p>Yes, we do recommend that you have both
sizes if you are planning on using the ProFlex with your clients/patients.  Unless you service a very specific
demographic with consistent foot sizes it is very likely that you will find
need of both the small and large versions of the ProFlex.  We have included the Licensed Professionals Package Perk so that you can get both at a significantly discounted price.  </p>
<p><b>9.  </b><b>What is the DCT ProFlex Ambassador
Program?  How can I get involved?</b></p>
<p>We are looking for people who are inspired
and passionate about the health and wellness industry to help spread the word
about DCT and the ProFlex.  Our
Ambassador Program is a unique opportunity to become a spokesperson for this
new and exciting product and be a focal point for our growing network of DCT
practitioners and clients in your area. 
As an ambassador you be among the first to be able wholesale the ProFlex
and earn commissions when we begin commercial sales of the product in the
Spring.  Getting involved is easy, simply
purchase the ProFlex along with one of the education packages and then email us

The DCT ProFlex addresses some of the most chronic and nagging
injuries of the lower body, such as:
• 
Plantar Fasciitis• 
Achilles Tendonitis• 
Shin Splints• 
Knee Pain• 
Arthritis• 
Posture-Based Lower Back Pain and more!
In addition to resolving pain from these specific injuries, the
DCT ProFlex is used by everyone from Professional and Elite Athletes looking
for the cutting edge in performance, to Seniors wanting to
improve their quality of life.  No matter where you lie on the health
continuum, DCT and the ProFlex will help you take control of your body, and
show you that it's possible to live both pain free and achieve superior levels
of performance. 
Dynamic Contraction
Technique, or DCT,
is a flexibility system that uses sequential muscle contractions to actively
balance tension, remove scar tissue, and ultimately improve muscle function and
strength. The DCT ProFlex is a leverage device that fastens to your foot
allowing users to perform DCT exercises and immediately improve blood
circulation, range of motion, and posture. This is truly the first easy to
learn, efficient, and powerfully effective therapeutic exercise system and
device on the market.

The DCT ProFlex can be used either INDIVIDUALLY or
by HEALTHCARE AND FITNESS PROFESSIONALS with their
clients.  The ProFlex is designed for two separate applications, one for
the shin and dorsal foot muscles and fascia, and the other for the calf
and plantar foot muscles and fascia. 


DCT Client and
Practitioner Testimonial Videos - Click the images below!


“I was introduced to Dynamic Contraction Technique (DCT) in April 2005, since then I have worked with Nic Bartolotta to create a flexibility program that best suits me.  DCT has helped me to prepare in a way that I know I am physically ready for anything.  The work is truly amazing, light years ahead of many of the other protocols commonly used in most athletic and fitness programs today.”   
Jayson Werth, Major League Baseball Player; 2008 World Series Champion; Right Fielder, Washington Nationals.

The true secret to
the ProFlex lies in understanding the biomechanics of the ankle.  There is
a common misconception that the Ankle joint operates like the hinge joint of a
door.  A door hinge has a single axis of motion and a stable pivot point
that the door swings around.  The knee and elbow joints are examples of
hinge joints in the body.    
But unlike a simple hinge joint, the ankle has 3 different axes
of motion creating a pivot point that actually moves in an arc when you point
and flex your foot.

This fact, now obvious
to you, has actually been overlooked by most designers when creating
rehabilitation and strength training devices for the lower leg and
ankle. If you design a product for the human foot that works
about a stable hinge joint then you lose out on 75% of the motion of the ankle
and can cause poor muscle recruitment, improper movement patterns, or even
injury.
If you look at the ProFlex in operation you can see very clearly
that the device allows for full and complete motion of the ankle around
its moving pivot point.  Unlike any other device on the market the
ProFlex allows for controlled resistance along each independent axes of motion
making it a superior rehabilitation tool for ankle sprains and fracture
recovery (show Supination and pronation and inversion eversion). 
This scientific breakdown of ankle and foot motion also gives
the ProFlex an unparalleled ability to strengthen muscles and connective tissue
that directly re-enforces proper foot mechanics and posture.

Nine-ply, high strength and quality Europly wood, high-grade
tubular nylon webbing for personal use strap, Breathable Hygienic Polyurethane
closed cell foam, Biomechanically Advanced & Ergonomic foot strap.
The ProFlex is made from
the highest quality materials and is produced 100% in the United States. 
The foam used for the foot pad is breathable and allows for the wicking of
sweat.  The foot strap is designed to be easily removed for cleaning and
replacement.  The wood used for the ProFlex is a 9 ply high strength
European ply wood that reduces the weight of the device while increasing
performance and longevity. 
To accommodate the wide range of foot sizes of DCT users, we
have customized two different sizes. 
Our Youth/Women’s ProFlex fits  8.5 or smaller shoe size (women's and youth)
Our Adult/Men's ProFlex fits shoe sizes 9 - 14 (women's) and
shoe sizes 7 - 12.5 (men's)
We are able to produce the ProFlex for Extra Large foot sizes as
well, however pricing varies on Qty ordered (For more information regarding XL
sizes inquire at info@dctproducts.com).

For our indiegogo campaign we have 3 wood color options and 4
strap color options.  Strap Colors are Yellow, Royal Blue, Silver, and
Black.  Wood Colors are Light Brown, Black, and Green.  Mix and match
as you please!



Limited Edition ProFlex Style Options: We are offering 2 limited
edition ProFlexes that will only be available during our Indiegogo campaign.

Option 1: The first Limited Edition ProFlex is for our
Military Benefit Perk and is your choice of board color with a camouflage foot
strap.  For every Camo ProFlex ordered we will donate $10 to the Warriors
Live On organization based out of San Diego.  And for every 10 Camo
ProFlexes ordered we will donate 1 ProFlex to a Veteran in the Warriors Live On
program and teach them how to use it!  It just so happens that our friends
at Warriors Live On are currently doing an Indiegogo campaign also, it’s called
Trek 2 Heal, check them out and help us help them by buying our Camouflage
ProFlex or donate directly to them at http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/warriors-live-on-trek2heal.
We really feel strongly about what they are doing and are excited to give to
such a great cause!

Option 2: The second Limited Edition ProFlex is for those of
you who want your ProFlex to last a lifetime! It's a machined and anodized blue
solid aluminum board with your choice of color foot strap.  This ProFlex
also has the DCT Logos, patent number, your name, and the limited edition
number engraved directly into the aluminum board. It really doesn’t get much
cooler than this!  Note: When you buy this Perk we throw in a regular wood
ProFlex that you can travel with, the solid aluminum doesn't quite meet TSA
guidelines!

In order to make sure you get the most out of your ProFlex we've
created an education program and resources that are as effective as they are
efficient and practical.  Teaching DCT Over the past 13 years, we have
found that if people can feel a significant change in their body in 10 minutes
or less, they're more likely to be consistent with their training.  As
such, both our individualized workouts, called TuneUps, and our assisted
therapy sessions are all designed to be highly focused and intense so that you
get the most out of your time.

As you learn and perfect each individual DCT exercise, we teach
you how to stack the exercises into proprietary DCT Progressions that
utilize muscle recruitment and activation of each consecutive exercise to
generate the maximum strength and stretch from a specific muscle group or line
of fascia (connective tissue).
For Therapists and Trainers learning to use the ProFlex with
their clients, the DCT Progressionsallow them to blend this work
into existing workout plans or treatment protocols seamlessly.

While DCT is a stand-alone therapy and training system it
is designed to be additive and can beused to enhance other
treatments or to help sustain results from other treatments.
At Harmonix Health we are leading the movement towards a
Preventative Healthcare Model.  We believe that everybody should be able
to take active measures to improve their quality of life, and Dynamic
Contraction Technique and the DCT ProFlex offer an affordable, practical way to
eliminate pain, avoid injuries, and improve physical performance on every
level.  

Developed over the past 13 years, Dynamic Contraction Technique,
also called DCT, is a highly evolved form of an existing corrective exercise
therapy known as “resistance stretching.”  Unlike traditional passive
stretching methods, resistance stretching uses muscle contractions to actively
release excess tension and balance the pressure across your joints.  
   


The secret to radical health benefits that have previously gone
untapped lies specifically in the use of the eccentric muscle
contraction.  An eccentric muscle contraction is achieved only when a
muscle remains contracted while being lengthened at the same time (also known
as “negatives” in weight training).  
Because you are contracting the muscle as you lengthen it, you
build strength and range of motion simultaneously,
immediately improving both posture and blood circulation.  By establishing
proper posture, we are able to isolate the root cause of an injury and create
the needed change in movement and muscle recruitment for perfect and
sustainable function.

Dynamic Contraction Technique embraces this principal of
cultivating strength throughout a muscle's full range of motion and is helping
redefine our notions of what it means to stretch and be flexible.  The DCT
ProFlex is the first product ever developed to utilize this groundbreaking
method. 
Due to the incredible torque created by the ankle joint, as well
as the remarkable strength of the calf and shin muscles, it is impossible to
facilitate an eccentric muscle contraction without assistance.  There
simply is not enough leverage to overpower the muscles that cross the ankle
joint and adequately perform a DCT exercise. 

And so it was out of basic necessity that the DCT ProFlex was
created.  While the concept is simple, in reality, the ProFlex boasts a
novelty and uniqueness in function that earned us a full Utility Patent from
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in September of 2012!

In
development for over 4 years, we have tested, refined, and simplified the
design of the ProFlex to be so easy to use and effective that we couldn’t help
but share it with the world through Indiegogo!
Here’s a breakdown of the perks you can choose from when you
support this campaign (select your perk from the sidebar at the top of this
page).  All perks come with education
materials for personal use of the device. 
Therapists and Trainers who purchase the ProFlex will be provided with
both the personal use and assisted use education materials.  Therapists/Trainers will be required to agree
to a terms of use document prior to being given access to the assisted use education materials.

DCT Client Pat Ricci, Suffered a Spinal Cord Injury at
Levels C5 & C6:“Sitting in a wheelchair all day tends to keep
my legs very tight.  My care givers and I
have learned to use the ProFlex as well as other DCT exercises as part of my weekly
routine.  When I use the ProFlex and do
DCT it literally makes my legs feel alive. 
Because I broke my neck and not my lower back I have what they call
Incomplete Quadriplegia, which means that I have some control of the muscles
below the site of my injury, but a lot of the time my muscles are in spasm
making difficult to do simple things like transfer from my wheelchair to bed.  Since I have been using DCT I have noticed
not only more flexibility and less spasms, but I have actually regained some strength
and movement that I had lost.  It has
been a remarkable addition to my life, and I strongly recommend DCT and the
ProFlex to anyone who wants to feel better and move better.”  - Pat Ricci, retired Coach and Teacher, and
an avid client of DCT
Licensed Acupuncturist and DCT Practitioner Dave Scully:“Dynamic Contraction Technique has been an
integral part of my practice for over 5 years now. As a practitioner of
Oriental Medicine I have found that the DCT exercises are very useful and
effective with treatments not just for orthopedic cases but all types of
complaints.  DCT is efficient and unique due to its integration of
Acupuncture Meridian theory, utilizing the 12 main meridians, the 8 extra and
the tendino-muscular channels along with western bio-mechanics. Many of my
patients have experienced the effectiveness of the personal and assisted DCT exercises
immediately. The personal exercises are easy to learn and a great tool for
teaching my patients how to work on themselves outside of treatments and to
reconnect with their bodies.""
Dave Scully, Dipl.OM, L.Ac. Cofounder of
OmniQi Wellness Center Collegeville PA. www.omniqi.com
Healthcare in the United States is facing the worst
crisis we have ever known.  Some 80
million people, around 43% of America's working-age adults, didn't go to the
doctor or access other medical services last year because of the cost.  But cost is not the only factor that has led
to a reactive attitude towards health and wellness in our nation.  We have been conditioned from childhood that
“if it aint broke, don’t fix it,” and we take this to heart when it comes to
our bodies.  There is a flawed perception
that our body should operate as we demand without the slightest attention paid to it
at all.  Unfortunately, pain is
historically our greatest motivator, and catastrophic injury is typically the
only thing serious enough to get us to change our behaviors and upgrade our lifestyle
choices. 
However, we now stand at a crossroads in Healthcare
where financially and physically we cannot afford to be complacent about the
aspects of Health and Wellness that we can actually control.  As healthcare costs and insurance premiums
steadily rise, a dramatic shift is taking place where people are stepping back
and choosing to proactively address avoidable health conditions and
injuries.  And until recently, most
proactive and preventative measures of Healthcare have come with a large price
tag making them unavailable to the masses. 


At Harmonix Health we are leading the movement towards
an affordable Preventative Healthcare Model; we believe that everybody should
be able to take active measures to improve their quality of life, and Dynamic
Contraction Technique and the DCT ProFlex offer an inexpensive and practical
way to eliminate pain, avoid injuries, and improve physical performance on
every level.

specific upper age limit for the ProFlex is difficult, but in general if an
elderly person has difficulty getting up and down from the floor then they will
do better using the ProFlex with a Therapist or Trainer certified in the DCT
ProFlex and who specializes with Seniors. 
However, if cleared by their doctor and able to easily lay on the floor
for exercise then the ProFlex will be of extremely beneficial to a Senior.  We have had 91 year olds attend DCT group
classes in San Diego with great success!
6.  What is the difference between the
Therapist & Trainer Perks and the regular Perks?
The difference between the Perks is in the
type of education materials provided with the purchase of the ProFlex.  As a Therapist or Trainer we will teach you
both how to do assisted (hands on) DCT exercises with your clients as well as
how to use the ProFlex by yourself so that you can teach your clients how to
use it on their own.  The Perks that
offer extra education packages include live webinar events where you will learn
how to perfect using the ProFlex and be able to ask questions and see live
demonstrations.
7.  I forgot to include the additional fee for
the Intermediate Education Package Upgrade, what should I do?
If you do not include the additional fee to
your contribution, not to worry, just make a new contribution via Indiegogo for
the additional fee, and then email your original order confirmation and the
additional fee confirmation to: sales@dctproducts.com Keep in mind that it is only necessary to pay the additional fee once, so if
you are buying multiple units you do not need to include the extra fee.
8.  If I am a Therapist or Trainer should buy
both the small and large versions of the ProFlex?  
Yes, we do recommend that you have both
sizes if you are planning on using the ProFlex with your clients/patients.  Unless you service a very specific
demographic with consistent foot sizes it is very likely that you will find
need of both the small and large versions of the ProFlex.  We have included the Licensed Professionals Package Perk so that you can get both at a significantly discounted price.  
9.  What is the DCT ProFlex Ambassador
Program?  How can I get involved?
We are looking for people who are inspired
and passionate about the health and wellness industry to help spread the word
about DCT and the ProFlex.  Our
Ambassador Program is a unique opportunity to become a spokesperson for this
new and exciting product and be a focal point for our growing network of DCT
practitioners and clients in your area. 
As an ambassador you be among the first to be able wholesale the ProFlex
and earn commissions when we begin commercial sales of the product in the
Spring.  Getting involved is easy, simply
purchase the ProFlex along with one of the education packages and then email us
directly at info@dctproducts.com.  We will be offering free ambassador training
events and experiences this winter and spring, so don’t miss out!
10.  Shipping Questions
Perks include free ground shipping in the
USA.  For international orders, please
note that there will be an additional charge based on the weight of the perk you are ordering, per device, for all
international orders.  This does not
include additional fees due to customs or other shipping costs to your country.
For international orders you may purchase your Perk now without paying for shipping, then contact us at sales@dctproducts.com  to provide us with your shipping address so that we can calculate the exact cost for shipping.  Once we have this information you will simply make a contribution in the amount needed for shipping.  A good rough estimate of international shipping costs is $45-$60 depending on your continent.",48.0,0,"1 Campaign

Unable to find a job, and with my situation getting worse, she didn't have a choice but to take care of me. She also had to take care of our son by herself. As of today, our family of three has to live of my disability income. What can be done? Little can be done as far as supplying me with factor VIII, so in absence of the possibility to  get Factor VIII in my country, our  wish is to compensate by starting a project to empower us for self sustaining.What we ask for is help us to help ourselves.1. Cristina's tailoring school project!My wife, Cristina has basic knowledge and some experience in tailoring and fashion design. One of our friends donated money for buying a sewing machine. But in order to be good at it, she needs professional training. The costs for school, including all 5 modules,  are as following:Ladies Tailoring Techniques+Patterns making          (8 months, 2 modules)            $4,800  Men's Tailoring Techniques +Patterns making          (8 months, 2 modules)           $5,000Fashion Design           (10 months 1 module)            $7,000Total:                                                                                                                $ 16,800Keep in mind that if the entire sum of $16,800 for whole course will not be reached, with less money, she can still do 1 or 2 modules, which will help her start working.The income that we project coming from her future job could help make ends meet, pay for some of the medications I need - anti-inflammatories and painkillers, pay for hospital visits, a better wheelchair and crutches.We hope is still time for our campaign to reach at least $4,800 , the cost for the Ladies Tailoring Techniques+Patterns making(8 months, 2 modules)  
2. Improve our living conditionsAdd external thermal insulation to my house and remodel the bathroom to allow wheelchair access. The cost for this is about $ 12,000.The total  sum requested is $ 28,800, a daring goal, but I hope that this campaign will succeed, as every dollar donated will make a difference in my life and will improve our chances as we continue the fight.If you have any questions or want to know more about our situation, please don't hesitate to contact me at +40 769 278 539 or ferareginae@gmail.com       II.  Romana Istoria mea, pe scurt        Numele meu este Cristian. Am fost diagnosticat cu hemofilie la varsta de 1 an.          Am petrecut cea mai mare parte a vietii luptand cu aceasta boala teribila.          Hemofilia este boala ereditara legata de cromozomul X, caracterizata printr-o tulburare a coagularii sangelui. hemofilia este transmisa in mod recesiv si legat de sex: gena in cauza se gaseste pe unul dintre cei doi cromozomi X ai mamei si doar baietii dezvolta boala. Tipul meu de hemofilie este A - factorul VIII de coagulre din sange lipseste - fiind o forma severa, unde factorul activ se afla intr-un procentaj mai mic de 1% fata de normal.          In perioada anilor 1983 - 1992, singurul tratament disponibil a fost plasma si crioprecipitatul, administrate in cazul sangerarilor. Am suferit de multe ori alergii in urma administrarii acestor tratamente si am fost infectat cu hepatita C in urma uneia dintre multele transfuzii de sange.          Dupa 1992, in urma donatiilor de factor VIII din tari ca Statele Unite, Canada, Germania sau Austria, unii dintre pacienti, cei norocosi, au putut beneficia de tratament.  Pentru ca factorul VIII nu este produs in Romania este nevoie de donatii si cereri pentru donatii. Ministerul Sanatatii dintodeauna a locat bugete foarte mici comparativ cu alte tari pentru achizitionarea de factor VIII, in ultimii ani acest tratament fiind aproape inexistent in hematologii.          Dozajul normal recomandat pentru administrare al factorului VIII este de 25-40 de unitati pe kg de 2 sau 3 ori pe saptamana; pe an nr. de unitati necesare unui hemofilic  s-ar ridica la 182.000 - 273.000. In ultimii patru ani spre exemplu, cu greu am primit 2000-5000 de unitati pe an. In acest an, cu greu am primit 1750 de unitati iar analizele mi-au fost refuzate.          Lipsa administrarii  profilactice sau in caz de episod hemoragic, a factorului VIII, duce la hemoragii repetate ale incheieturilor, provocand artropatia hemofilica - o deteriorare avansata a coatelor, genunchilor si incheieturilor mainii in cazul meu, alaturi de dureri acute, cronice.           Mobilitatea mea este foarte mult afectata; folosesc carje din 2008 si in timpul activitatilor ce implica folosirea mainilor si a picioarelor experimentez dureri foarte puternice. Incepand de anul trecut am fost nevoit sa folosesc un carucior, pentru ca durerile din genunchi, coate  si de la incheietura mainii drepte nu-mi mai permit sa folosesc carjele mai mult de 5 - 10 minute. De multe ori experimentez, deasemenea, hemoragii spontane la rinichi, nas si gingii.        Ce poate fi facut?         Dorinta noastra este sa reusim sa compensam raul deja facut usurand pe cat posibil efectele acestei boli prin conditii mai bune de viata. Acest deziderat noi il dorim realizat in sensul de a folosii  eventualul ajutor primit, ca start pentru posibilitati de autosustinere in viitor.    Cristina, in acest moment deja  a inceput activititatea in domeniul croitoriei si designului vestimentar, in termeni modesti bineinteles, un prieten oferindu-i si  banii necesari pentru o masina de cusut performanta.Pentru a se perfectiona insa in acest doemniu, dorinta noastra este sa inceapa un set de cursuri de specialitate.Croitorie dama + curs tipare  (8 luni, 2 module)             $4,800  Croitorie barbati + curs tipare (8 luni, 2 module)           $5,000Design Vestimentar                    (10 luni 1 modul)           $7,000Total:                                                                                    $ 16,800Chiar daca suma totala nu va fi atinsa, chiar cu mai putin,  va putea face totusi un modul sau doua, atat cat ne va permita suma finala!
Speram ca mai este inca timp ca proiectul nostru sa atinga  suma  $4,800 , costul pentru cursul de Croitorie Dama si cursul de Tipare Dama (8 luni, 2 module).

            
             Imbunatatirea conditiilor de viata
             Este necesara tencuiala si izolarea termica exterioara a casei si refacerea baii pentru uzul facil al acesteia. Costul pentru aceste lucrari se ridica la 12.000 de dolari.
             Suma totala necesara este de 28.800 de dolari, o tinta indrazneata, intr-adevar, dar sper ca aceasta campanie va avea succes, intrucat fiecare dolar va face o diferenta in viata noastra si va mari sansele de reusita in lupta noastra cu efectele hemofiliei.

I am a Peace Corps volunteer entering my second year of service and looking to leave behind a sustainable foundation for a youth soccer league. We have already successfully formed the soccer league for kids ages 10-12, with 100+ participants and 12 community organizers serving as coaches and referees. In 2013 we successfully founded the league, completed a regular season schedule of 10 games, and finished with a championship - if you would like to see highlights <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHd0aC2jLfA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a>. Going into the next year we are hoping to expand the program with 2 more divisions to enable more participation in different age groups, both older and younger.

<p>We thank you all for your time and everything you do no matter what it is, to help us realize our dream!</p>
</div></div>","OUR STORY... Doc Holliday Sauces is a Lake Orion, Michigan based ""Clean"" Ingredient sauce producer that was launched in February of 2012 with the introduction of our ""CLEAN"" ingredient steak sauce. 
My name is Raymond Najor and the beautiful Hawaiian girl next me is Joycelyn Alexander; my business partner and fiance.



Our mission, is to make Doc Holliday Sauces, part of the 'CLEAN' eating movement that is Rapidly growing across the country and to challenge the myth, that all natural, gluten free foods have to cost more. 

We felt that Indiegogo - being a ""Grassroots"" funding resource - was our best option, because the contributors are everyday people like us... Unlike the banks that have told us that we have not been in business long enough to qualify for a loan! 


Our sauces not only challenge the marketplace standard, but was inspired by the need to show the consumer that it doesn't have to cost more to eat healthy; that a 'CLEAN' healthy alternative that is free of artificial preservatives and colors, is gluten free and bears a lower consumer price than even standard sauces by giant corporate brands, let alone those 'pricey' so called ""all natural"" competitors!

Demand for our clean sauce alternative is growing; meeting the demand for our steak sauce is not the issue; the issue, is that the steak sauce is the only item we have in the marketplace, and with all the expenses involved; production, labels, freight, etc., all we are doing is breaking even.With the introduction of our new line of sauces and marinades into the marketplace, Doc Holliday Sauces becomes self sufficient and self sustaining... instead of 1 item in the market, we would now have 4, which for us, would mean an increase in revenue, market share and sustainability.Joyce and I have personally traveled to every state and nearly every store Doc Holliday is in. We do our own sales, our own demos (whenever possible) and have basically been our own marketing department. 

DOING A DEMO AT WESTERN MARKET IN CANTON, MI.

DEMO AT JOHNNY POMODORO'S  FRESH MARKET in FARMINGTON, MI.

At one point, I had been on the road for 2 months straight, only returning home twice to get some fresh clothing and to see my fiance Joycelyn.Doc Holliday Sauces is our life; We eat, sleep and dream Doc Holliday;  something that started as an idea in January of 2012 and became reality a month later. We started with $200.00; an old desk, phone, home computer and a small 300 square foot office that cost us $100.00 a month, in Downtown Pontiac, Michigan and have built it into what it is today.WE NEED THIS NEW LINE! Without the addition of the 3 new sauces, we are fighting a battle that always ends in a draw. Constantly breaking even without taking a salary is hard way to go.And we haven't: taken a salary that is.With your support, we will be able to have a successful line launch into roughly 50% of our current retail customer base, expand our warehousing, produce a shipper, build a stronger infrastructure and robust marketing platform to help promote our 'CLEAN' sauce alternative across the country.Not only will your contributions help make us viable and self sustaining, but your contributions will also be helping American Veterans suffering from Traumatic Brain Injuries and PTSD because Doc Holliday donates a SMALL portion of profits from the sale of every case to The Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund! 



THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN GRILLED CHICKEN WITH DOC!

Joyce and I have put our lives into Doc Holliday Sauces; and not just our time; Our blood, sweat and tears, our passion and future and the future of our children and grandchildren! We have put every penny (and then some) we could scrape together into this endeavor!
We have been told we have the BEST STEAK SAUCE on the market; I believe it.

@DocSauces and a great job ur doing! I have been having all my friends sample the sauce and it's a hit here!!!

But without the addition of the 3 new sauces and marinades, our road will begin to crumble because the income from one item cannot sustain the growth we are experiencing let alone launch any new products.


WHY DO WE NEED YOUR MONEY?
 
To grow our brand and
distribution to a nation-wide ""clean"" eating, lower cost alternative
to the big artificial ingredient sauce brands that currently define the market.
Funds are to be used to increase production,produce  new line of sauces and marinades, build infrastructure and a robust marketing platform to promote the ""clean"" sauce alternative across the country. Costs for larger production runs will aid in keeping the commercial price of Doc Holliday Sauces below those of large standard sauce competitors brands dominating supermarket shelves.



New Packaging: 3 new flavors = front label, back label and neck wrap



New Display: We will be producing what is known in the industry as a ""Shipper Display"". A shipper display has all 4 products (Steak Sauce and 3 flavors of BBQ) packed into the same shipping carton; when it arrives at the retail location, it is opened and assembled into a self contained display.


(Example Figure 1)

Warehouse Expansion that is desperately needed: Pallet racks

Website completion
Distributor and Retail Chain Slotting Fees; You pay for warehouse space with distributors and shelf space with the retail chains. 
   Simply put, your contribution will get us the labels, initial production run, and warehousing.
If we do not reach our goal, the funds raised will be disbursed in the following order:


Labels
First production run of New Sauces and Marinades
Shipper displays

Everything else is secondary.

The Impact of your Contribution...

When you wear your “I Am My Own Guru” bracelet, it says you’re strong and self-empowered. It says that you’ve come to yoga class to take care of your body and mind – not to get manipulated, groped or assaulted.

Can a purple bracelet really change yoga? Only time will tell.

And we need your help to get it there!

What Exactly Will We Use This Funding For?
We will use all of these much needed funds to properly finish up the development of our App. and the huge data base needed to run it. We will also run advertisements to help raise awareness of these deadly food safety problems that exist,  while spreading word of our problem solver App.
Most importantly this opportunity will enable us to be able to afford to provide a free version along with our premium version of S.T.O.P. All Recalls, this way everyone will be able to own it on any budget. We hope to be able to remain ad-free as well.
______________________________________________________________________
The average consumer is only aware of 1-5% of recalls and consumer warnings that directly effect them or their loved ones..
We live in a world full of unsafe and contaminated food caused by careless companies that put their profits over the well-being of the people. It doesn’t stop there, anything that you receive may seem to  be safe, but in fact be extremely defective(Cars,drinks,electronics,etc.)
There are two defenses that we have in place today, that are supposed to prevent these defective products from ever even reaching the consumer in the first place.
First, is the inspection process. Most people believe that this system does exactly what it seems it is suppose to do, which would be inspect everything that all of our food/ products come in contact with from start to finish.
Truth is...that there are way too many flaws in this system, And no where near enough enforced laws and regulations in it! 
1 in 6 people, will become sick from a foodborne illness this year.. About half of these innocent people who fall victim to foodborne illnesses, will suffer from effects many years after actually eating the contaminated food, that they usually don't even know they ate.
It is very common for people to believe all the food they eat, buy,and own is completely safe... 
Most people with life long health issues don't even know what is causing everything to go wrong with them, and its near impossible for doctors to be able to diagnose that their unusual symptoms are caused by defective/contaminated food. Typically because they wait so long to go get it checked out, And by then the foods long gone from their system, but the effects it has on the body don't usually just go away.
In some cases people who's immune systems had enough strength to help defeat cancer, couldn't even put up the fight against the deadly contaminated food they ate and then they passed away shortly after from the effects the systemic health issues had on their bodies. Even with the recent 2011 passing of the food modernization act that my uncle helped The Pew Organization pass...there still isn't any money being put into funding the fight against this epidemic, And everyday more and more unaware innocent people are dying because of it. 
As a safety precaution there is a second line of defense in place incase the product makes it past the inspection process, which there is a very good chance that it will...
This is called the recall system. It is designed to warn all consumers about products that are defective, and all food that is contaminated... That somehow wasn't noticed when it was being manufactured or inspected. 
This system has many flaws itself. In the past 5 years we’ve seen a dramatic increase in recalls in the U.S. and its only been getting worse.The current recall system requires all manufacturers and companies to report all recalls to the public, to warn consumers that they need to return or dispose of these defective or contaminated items immediately. 
The biggest problem with this system, is the way these recalls are distributed. There’s no organization of this information, which leads to a very dangerously low rate of informed consumers!!
I used to think between the news and social media, that i knew about all or most of the dangerous recalls out there. 
I was completely wrong, I wasn't even aware of 5% of them, And I was in the same position most of the world is in today.. I was trusting an untrustworthy industry to produce food and products that were safe, and if there was something wrong with them i trusted an unreliable source of inspectors to find the problem and correct it before it was even available to be purchased by me or anyone else. 
Also, If it couldn't be corrected i expected that the news/internet headlines would report every single recall to me, but that's not the case at all. Today if someone wants to know if a certain product is recalled they need to be their own investigator, and a good one at that. 
It takes up endless hours of your time to do all the research, and you still wont find every recall that effects you directly,and it shouldn't have to be that way. It should be a lot easier on the consumer!
One day this was all brought to my attention by my uncle getting sick from eating some recalled peanut butter, that he had no idea was recalled... That's because it wasn’t recalled for an entire year! 
The day he ate it he immediately began to feel horrible and knew something wasn't right. When he went to the doctors, they had no idea what was wrong with him.. He suffered from multiple infections and other life changing symptoms that still effect him to this day, And they are taking a major tole on his life. Not just him hundreds of thousands of people across the world are in his same position, if not worse, or dead.
After becoming sick and realizing what caused it to happen, and discovering how big of an epidemic this problem really was..He then became a food advocate, inspiring many people like me and everybody here at S.T.O.P. All Recalls to pay more attention to the food we are eating. Before we even buy it, while spreading the word to everyone we could..About this silent serial killer!!
When i learned how bad this problem was, I immediately began to start thinking of a solution. I knew there had to be a better way of warning people about all these recalls, and there had to be a way to only inform the consumer of the products that they are prone to purchase, or already have purchased. Then it hit me.. What was missing was a software application!!
An app. like nothing before it, that takes each individual recall and distributes it directly to each individual affected consumer, store,  restaurant, or potential affected consumers/stores/restaurants..  This patented app., “The Direct Digital Distribution Of Life Saving Information Software Application” is unlike anything on the market because its the only one of its kind. Its designed to do one thing and one thing only..And that is to save as many lives as it possibly can.
Today, there are endless amounts of recalls being issued, that majority of the population are completely un-aware of...
This a big problem, but we have an even bigger solution to solve it!
Let me start by explaining to you how this life saving application works.. 
Picture each recall as a local news headline, if every local news headline across the country/world were all reported on the same station, and on the same website with no organization it would be completely too difficult for anyone to use efficiently.Therefore people wouldn't even bother looking.
Which is exactly what’s happening with these recalls, and has been for entirely too long. It’s time for a major change. It’s time for The S.T.O.P. All Recalls App. to be on every app. accessible electronic device possible. 
When a user first downloads this application to their electronic device(Cell phone, tablet, computer, car, etc.), they get to setup a profile containing all the items they buy, bought, or plan to buy in the future. They may also select items that they want to receive information on that someone they know might buy or own, such as their children, relatives, or pets. They can always go back and edit these selections at any time. 
The user then identifies their city, state, and most shopped at stores or locations...
When choosing what groceries, the consumer is presented with a list that breaks down food as you would find it within the grocery store. Into categories such as (Vegetables, Fruits, Seafood, Meat, Bread, Canned Goods, Rice, Oils, Dressings, Flour/Cooking Products, Peanut Butter, Cookies/Packaged Deserts, Candy, Soups, Jelly/Jams, Coffee, Condiments, Milk, Cheese, Etc.)
Keeping the selection process as simple as possible is the key to keep the consumer interested, which also keeps the consumer informed.
Each user can also go through many other lists of a huge selection of products that they may want to be notified about if there are any recalls or consumer warnings for them to.. Such as ( Medicine, Prescription Medicine, Vitamins, Automobiles, Clothing, Building Materials, Baby Products, Pet Food, Other Pet Products, Makeup/Beauty Supplies, Etc.). 
Every item will display a picture icon next to it for easier identification, and with one touch on either the name or icon, they simply add the item to their list of “Important Info I Need To Know,” and continue scrolling down. 
This makes it to where the user will receive all info. about that item.After filling out the information on their profile the users are then directed to
 “The Welcome Home Screen,” where they have access to 15 different menu's. - Important Info I Need To Know, Search All Recalls, Most Recalled Products, Deadly Disease Information, Protecting Your Pets, Diabetes Daily, Curing Cancer, All Consumer Warnings, Farm-Crop-&-Livestock, All Around The World, Restaurant Reviews, Local Weather And News,” (One local news station And one local weather station for each area.),Prescriptions & Vitamins, All Other Life Saving Info, And 24/7 Consumer Support.-Within these 15 options,they can browse through endless amounts of life saving information..

“S.T.O.P. All Recalls” is operated by our team of dedicated food safety advocates who gather all recalls, consumer warnings, and life saving information from various trusted sources throughout the entire world wide internet. 
Our team also collects information from consumers, and other trusted partners who report it directly to us. All of this information gathered from every source will be verified to make sure that it is legitimate. We then track every store, restaurant, and location that the recalled item has been, or is due to be delivered to. And inform them, but usually it is too late of a recall being issued and most of the contaminated products have already been purchased by the consumer by the time the stores can be notified, but our policy at S.T.O.P. is to tell everyone about every single recall issued including telling stores and restaurants.In order to distribute the life saving information directly to each affected user, we place all of this information into each specific affected area server folder under the individual item category. Then all users who live close to these locations or those who have selected these affected items/stores/locations as their favorites will be notified either the next time they open the app., or if they choose to receive push notifications from the app. to their device they will be alerted the second that we place the information into the database. 
This database is where all information throughout the entire application is accessed via the internet. Users can also browse through all of this information, even the recalls that they aren’t as prone to come in contact with. They can also always browse these recalls from all over within the “Search All Recalls” menu, located on the “The Welcome Home Screen.”
S.T.O.P. All Recalls will be known for our accurate reports, and the valuable life saving info. that we provide. Also our well known customer service,questions,and concerns 24 hour hot-line system will be available for consumers who need to talk to us at anytime about any questions, concerns, or reports of any recalls or consumer warnings or any life saving information that they might have for us. 
_____________________________________________________________________
Without this much needed App., products within every industry (food, auto, medication, clothing, etc.,) will unfortunately continue to see increases in recalls every year, and thats a proven fact.
There’s already laws and guidelines in place for all these industries. For now though, enforcing them isn’t on the top of our governments list of things to do. So just passing new laws won’t fix it, it has been tried too many times and proven to not make any major impacts on these food safety/product recall issues time and time again!!
That makes it up to us, the people of this fine country to take matters into our own hands. The only way to get everybody to pay attention to this issue, is to help bring it to is for us to help bring it to their attention. S.T.O.P. All Recalls works together with all the top food safety organizations, and eventually other big organizations will jump aboard and help us make sure that every single person who is alive today knows how many recalls are issued on a daily basis!! 
With this app. we will be able to save millions of lives by not only raising awareness of these issues, but eventually these manufacturers and huge companies will start taking the handling and inspection of their products way more seriously. 
They will then be forced to adapt or they will loose all of their customers as they continue to find out about their endless amount of recalls caused by their repeated poor decisions, through the info on our app. 
This App. is patent protected because we don't ever want its control to ever get into the wrong hands of anyone who may use it for the wrong reasons, or who may not take it seriously enough. We are positive that we have the prefect most fit, constant growing team of hard working food advocates that can handle running this new and improved recall system the right way.

All of you who pledge $25 and up will be one of the first people to receive our upgraded premium version of the S.T.O.P. All Recalls App. on the day it is released to the public, free of charge! (App. link will be distributed to you, via e-mail) 

Now that you are aware of this huge problem that continues to get worse day by day, you are left with two choices, 

Either you can help us S.T.O.P. the problem, Or you can accept it..
We hope you choose to walk with us.

<h3>The Back Story:</h3>
In 2006, at age 26, Matt Pearson was experiencing severe abdominal pain while working on a home renovation in Hawaii.  He went to the doctor and was told that he had a kidney infection and was prescribed antibiotics.  Over the next few days, the pain became so severe that he knew something else was wrong.  Fearing the worst, he went to New Mexico to stay with his sister for a while and seek treatment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once in New Mexico, the pain became so unbearable that Matt had to go to the emergency room.  The doctors that saw him ordered abdominal scans and scopes and it was then that he was diagnosed with agressive colon cancer.  The doctors were astounded that someone so young was being attacked by an illness normally observed in much older patients.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Matt had surgery to remove the tumor and most of his lower intestine and to install an ileostomy.  After radiation, his soft-tissue wounds were slow to heal and he developed a large mass of internal scar tissue in his pelvic region.  After two more major surgeries to attempt the remediation of the scar tissue, Matt began to heal and get stronger.  By this time, it was 2009.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>During 2009 and 2010, Matt was able to work as a courier for a company in New Mexico that services veterinary clients, but he never gave up his desire to move back to Savannah.  In early 2011, Matt did make the move from New Mexico to Savannah, going to work with his primary skill set, carpentry. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Very soon after his arrival back here, he began to have more severe abdominal pain...again! (It should be noted that he has lived with some pain since his first diagnosis.)  He was also beginning to have urination problems.  The doctors that he saw in Savannah found that his bladder wasn't functioning properly and they installed two nephrostomies to drain his kidneys.  They ordered more scans and determined that he now had bladder cancer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The doctors consulted and decided that the best solution was the removal of his bladder and the scar tissue mass that was still present.  Matt bravely (again) underwent surgery in late 2011.  When the surgeons opened his abdominal cavity, however, they were shocked to discover that the scar tissue mass had metastasized, spreading to his pelvic bones as well.  They were not able to remove anything because of how widespread the cancer was.  They closed him up and ordered a long and strong regimen of chemotherapy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After nine months of chemotherapy, Matt had lost 100 pounds and was down to only 115.  For reference, Matt is six feet tall.  After another couple of scans, the doctors determined that the cancer had not shrunk enough for another attempt at removal, and that Matt was too weak to continue chemotherapy.  Around this time, Matt began having excruciating hip pain.  He was readmitted to the hospital and doctors found cancer-related fluid was building up around his sciatic nerve and causing pressure, therefore causing the pain.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Doctors installed a fluid drain in his hip to try and relieve his pain, and it has worked to some degree, thank God.  After another 15 days in the hospital, Matt was discharged.  That was this past Saturday, August 18, 2012.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>What Matt Needs Now</h3>
<div>Matt is currently unable to work since he is still in a weakend state from chemotherapy and cancer.  He receives a very small amount of government assistance and some help from family and friends, but it just is not enough for his medicine, rent, utilities, vehicle insurance, food, new glasses, etc.  He needs a few new clothes since all his old ones are twice his size now.  The list goes on, but you get the idea.</div>
<div>
<h3>
<br/>Why This Is Written in the Third Person</h3>
Matt is fiercly independent, and is very reluctant to ask anyone for help.  He would rather swim in misery than intrude on anyone.  While this is a very noble trait, it is to the point now where we as loving human beings can't let him do this so independently any more.  After much deliberation and humbling conversation, Matt agreed to let me launch a campaign on his behalf.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>What You Can Do</h3>
<p>Obviously, a small monetary donation would be a great blessing to Matt, but besides that, a prayer or a comment of well-wishing for Matt on this campaign page would certainly brighten his day.  Also, please share this with as many people as you can.  If this campaign is able to build momentum, it will help a wonderful, generous, beautiful person live in relative comfort.  Please be sure to share using the tools under Matt's picture.  Thank you for reading.</p></div>","The Back Story:

<p>Eventhea was conceived for two very simple reasons:</p>
<p>1. My family got tired of watching the news on Monday morning and seeing all the cool stuff that occurred over the weekend that we were oblivious to. With Eventhea, anyone can go on and see local events not only for their area, but also for anywhere they may be headed to…</p>
<p>2. We found that there is a lack of organized sharing on the internet that does not involve friends. I wanted to easily find content for specific events all in one place.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’m talking about: A couple of years ago I took my family to Disney World for their annual Halloween party. That night, I took a video of my 5 year old son dancing with Goofy and another little girl. After a few minutes the girl’s mother came up to me crying her eyes out because her camera had run out of batteries and she missed pretty much the entire moment.</p>
<p>She asked me for a copy of the video and even though I was happy to give it to her, we both realized we had a problem. How would I get it to her? Friend her on Facebook? I really don’t want to friend this stranger. Youtube or some other sharing site? Good luck finding it. Email? File is too large.</p>
<p>Eventhea was born. We have a feed for national events, that’s easy enough. We are building an API that will allow anyone to submit their feed to Eventhea for inclusion. We are also manually building feeds for event providers in the larger markets.</p>
<p>Events can be anything! Concerts, sports, fund raising, environmental… ANYTHING!</p>
<p>The idea is that people can find, create and contributing content to events. Basically, it's an event-based social networking site.</p>
<p>There are no fees to use Eventhea, including creating events. It is 100% free to all users! </p>
<p>A great feature that really sets us apart is our Event Slider. You can choose your event categories, date range and region and view your chosen events similar to how you see weather forecasts on the news. Think of the oil spill in Louisiana. Users can create an event for their specific spill and using the slider, viewers can see the spill unfold as it really happened.</p>
<p>We have several items we want to expand upon:</p>
<p>1. Move to a SQL database. We have outgrown our proof-of-concept site.</p>
<p>2. MORE POWER! Speed costs money…</p>
<p>3. Renovate and simplify the Slider and search. This includes eliminating the date range and simply having +/- buttons for the dates.</p>
<p>4. Add more local events.</p>
<p>This round of funding will go towards as much as we can to get the site finished!</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Eventhea’s goal is to have EVERY event WORLD-WIDE listed on our site and allow users to post their own content. You want to see videos from the Christmas Art Walk in South Beach, go to Eventhea!</p>
<p>We are not some large company. We are a few passionate, dedicated individuals doing the best we can to realize our vision. We have raised some money, which allowed us to develop what we currently have as well as pay for licensing for stuff like geo-tagging and the Google map. None of us have taken any kind of payment or salary and we have all contributed our own hardware to this venture. Any money we raise will go 100% towards bettering the site. I believe in this site so much that my family is making many sacrifices to pay the huge hosting bill each month…</p>

Our current project involves the use of state of the art technology, including four Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and eight Electromyography (EMG) devices which range in cost from $500 to $1,400 each. The IMUs are used to measure acceleration and rotation and the EMGs are used to measure electrical activity in the muscles. In addition to the ten devices which are placed on the legs of research participants, our study requires that we have multiple advanced laptop computers, a high-speed camera and the necessary software in order to obtain viable data to analyze. These technological expenses are added on top of those associated with paying for research participants and assistants. For example, each participant is provided with a pair of boots for consistency in testing. As a small university we have limited funds for scientific research and rely heavily on external funding.</p>
<p>      Although we have the equipment and resources that we need to conduct our study on a small scale, we will require a great deal more equipment and funding in order to expand the study from twelve participants to over one hundred. The increased size of the test group will validate our results, allowing us to develop a more advanced fall prevention device that has greater applicability. This proposed device will be superior to existing fall alert systems because it not only functions retroactively but also preventatively. The device will be worn around the waist as a belt and linked to a central computer in order to record the movements of the wearer and indicate where his or her instabilities lie. For example, instability may frequently arise when the individual moves between rooms with different flooring. The system will be equipped with an alarm that warns when the wearer's stability is compromised. These features will help the individual move more safely. If a fall should occur, the central computer will be linked to emergency medical services (EMS). Not only will it alert EMS, but also provide them with detailed information about the nature of the fall including how hard the fall was, the direction, and whether there was movement after the fall. This technology can not only be applied to the elderly, but also to those with neuromuscular disorders.</p>

The fracture was not found until almost 2 months later, which complicated the healing process. I was on sick leave (in a cast and on crutches) for almost half of last year. That is when I began to fall behind on my mortgage. Fortunately, I had enough savings to keep my head above water for most of that time. Approximately one month after returning to work, I suffered my first ever grand mal seizure just before one of our flights out of Limerick, Ireland. Needless to say, I went right back on sick leave. I was informed that if I was diagnosed with epilepsy, I could not work as a flight attendant again. One month later, I suffered another seizure (at home). Two weeks after that, I was terminated. On December 7, 2011, I awoke on my bathroom floor cut and bleeding in various places from yet another seizure. I was diagnosed with epilepsy the next day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the state of Georgia, I am not allowed to drive within 6 months of a seizure. I live alone, and have no family any closer than Wisconsin. Without insurance, I am left to pay out-of-pocket for my own medicines and doctor visits with the $173/week that I receive from unemployment (Thank God!), which will be running out within the next month or two. My medicines cost $200 this month. And, since I have no children, I do not qualify for any type of free health insurance. My home was scheduled for foreclosure March 6<sup>th</sup>, however, the mortgage company lowered my payment and agreed to give me a trial period. My mortgage is now $548.00 per month. As you can imagine, I am not able to cover my mortgage and utilities on my current income. My car insurance and cell phone (which I need to call 911 if I hurt myself during a seizure) have been cut off. And, I fear that my electricity (my home is all electric) and other utilities will be next. My family has helped with that they have, but they have informed me that they do not have much more to give. I apply for work-from-home jobs each day, but have yet to be hired. Some say my computer software is too old, which disqualifies me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have a post graduate education, have studied at universities around the world, and possess many other skills. My teaching certificate for grades Prek-12 (6-12 English only) is still current, as well. And, I have applied and sent my resume to every online school I know. I have a strong desire to work and make my own income so the insults from my family will stop. Without being able to drive, finding a job is more than difficult. Being only 31, single with no children puts me on the bottom of the list for government agencies that offer aid. I need help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently, my foot fracture is still causing me pain. I have a cane and cushioned boot that sometimes help. I am also going to physical therapy for my foot, in hope that the pain will heal and my work options will not be limited by this. Fortunately, this care is covered by workers’ compensation. This does not, however, cover any other expense. Since I continue to have seizures, my medical expenses are taking a huge toll on me, also.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I proudly purchased my home at 24yrs old. My interest rate is now just over 3%, and my monthly payments are less than most apartment rent. At times, I may seize and lose consciousness when I stand, my foot may hurt when I walk. But, at the very least, I would love to keep the place where I can lie and rest my head.</p>

<p>In summary, please help me get the medical treatment I need, and save my home.</p></div>","On January 19, 2011, I suffered a foot fracture while working, as a flight attendant, for a charter airline that flies our U.S. (and British) soldiers between bases around the world. The fracture was not found until almost 2 months later, which complicated the healing process. I was on sick leave (in a cast and on crutches) for almost half of last year. That is when I began to fall behind on my mortgage. Fortunately, I had enough savings to keep my head above water for most of that time. Approximately one month after returning to work, I suffered my first ever grand mal seizure just before one of our flights out of Limerick, Ireland. Needless to say, I went right back on sick leave. I was informed that if I was diagnosed with epilepsy, I could not work as a flight attendant again. One month later, I suffered another seizure (at home). Two weeks after that, I was terminated. On December 7, 2011, I awoke on my bathroom floor cut and bleeding in various places from yet another seizure. I was diagnosed with epilepsy the next day.
 
In the state of Georgia, I am not allowed to drive within 6 months of a seizure. I live alone, and have no family any closer than Wisconsin. Without insurance, I am left to pay out-of-pocket for my own medicines and doctor visits with the $173/week that I receive from unemployment (Thank God!), which will be running out within the next month or two. My medicines cost $200 this month. And, since I have no children, I do not qualify for any type of free health insurance. My home was scheduled for foreclosure March 6th, however, the mortgage company lowered my payment and agreed to give me a trial period. My mortgage is now $548.00 per month. As you can imagine, I am not able to cover my mortgage and utilities on my current income. My car insurance and cell phone (which I need to call 911 if I hurt myself during a seizure) have been cut off. And, I fear that my electricity (my home is all electric) and other utilities will be next. My family has helped with that they have, but they have informed me that they do not have much more to give. I apply for work-from-home jobs each day, but have yet to be hired. Some say my computer software is too old, which disqualifies me.
 
I have a post graduate education, have studied at universities around the world, and possess many other skills. My teaching certificate for grades Prek-12 (6-12 English only) is still current, as well. And, I have applied and sent my resume to every online school I know. I have a strong desire to work and make my own income so the insults from my family will stop. Without being able to drive, finding a job is more than difficult. Being only 31, single with no children puts me on the bottom of the list for government agencies that offer aid. I need help.
 
Currently, my foot fracture is still causing me pain. I have a cane and cushioned boot that sometimes help. I am also going to physical therapy for my foot, in hope that the pain will heal and my work options will not be limited by this. Fortunately, this care is covered by workers’ compensation. This does not, however, cover any other expense. Since I continue to have seizures, my medical expenses are taking a huge toll on me, also.
 
I proudly purchased my home at 24yrs old. My interest rate is now just over 3%, and my monthly payments are less than most apartment rent. At times, I may seize and lose consciousness when I stand, my foot may hurt when I walk. But, at the very least, I would love to keep the place where I can lie and rest my head.
 
In summary, please help me get the medical treatment I need, and save my home.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style="""">diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at the age of 47. David, a former bodybuilder and health club owner, exercised regularly and lived a healthy<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>lifestyle. He was devastated by the diagnosis and frustrated by the physical limitations of his<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>condition. His initial MS attack left him with partial paralysis, tightness, pain and numbness<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>in his extremities and back. These common symptoms of MS come and go without warning.<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>The multiple lesions in Davidâ€™s spinal cord make it difficult for him to coordinate movements and they affect his balance. The lesions in his brain cause cognitive problems affecting his concentration. And the lesion by his optic nerve, at times, causes vision impairment and blackness when seeing out of his left eye. David also lives in a constant state of fatigue caused by this disease attacking his nervous system.</p>
<p style="""">While in the hospital the doctors told David he would most likely leave in a wheelchair and<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>would not return to his normal workout routine. They also warned him that MS is a disease<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>that most often progressively worsens and to prepare for his limitations as he ages.</p>
<p style="""">So what does David do? Give up and sink into depression? Grab a walker to steady<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>himself? Retreat to bed to conserve his strength?</p>
<p style="""">NO...AT THE AGE OF 50 DAVID LYONS DECIDED TO COMPETE<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>IN A NPC BODYBUILDING COMPETITION!</p>
<p style="""">David knew he could not do this alone, so he assembled a team he calls The Challenge Team. Putting this team together was no easy task. David needed dedicated, talented experts on his side to make this challenge a reality.</p>
<p style="""">David is a courageous man who has rallied the support of many who know what he faces.<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>Davidâ€™s doctors all told him that his pursuit of a bodybuilding title was sheer madness,<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>especially at 50 years old...but if anyone could do it - he could.

<p style="""">On August 22, 2009, David competed in his first competition where he was awarded an<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>impressive trophy for THE MOST INSPIRATIONAL BODYBUILDER!</p>

As David states, â€œThe two most important people in my life during The MS Bodybuilding Challenge will always be my wife, Kendra, who gives up her husband while I train and diet for these events and is willing to keep doing it until I retire (which, wonâ€™t be in the near future!). She is an inspiration to me as she has the compassion to deal with sick people all day as a nurse and then come home to help me shows the heart of a rare woman and a true blessing.</p>
<p style="""">And God who, without His grace, love and strength, I could have never made it out of the hospital and on to that stage in 2009 and onto others. It is never by my might or power but by His will that I push forward.</p>

<p style="""">This is not about me winning contests, it's about motivating other MS patients<br style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px;""/>to take control of their lives, get fit and beat the odds in every way possible.

</div></div>","Our Story


In 2006, David Lyons was hospitalized and
diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis at the age of 47. David, a former bodybuilder and health club owner, exercised regularly and lived a healthylifestyle. He was devastated by the diagnosis and frustrated by the physical limitations of hiscondition. His initial MS attack left him with partial paralysis, tightness, pain and numbnessin his extremities and back. These common symptoms of MS come and go without warning.The multiple lesions in Davidâ€™s spinal cord make it difficult for him to coordinate movements and they affect his balance. The lesions in his brain cause cognitive problems affecting his concentration. And the lesion by his optic nerve, at times, causes vision impairment and blackness when seeing out of his left eye. David also lives in a constant state of fatigue caused by this disease attacking his nervous system.
While in the hospital the doctors told David he would most likely leave in a wheelchair andwould not return to his normal workout routine. They also warned him that MS is a diseasethat most often progressively worsens and to prepare for his limitations as he ages.
So what does David do? Give up and sink into depression? Grab a walker to steadyhimself? Retreat to bed to conserve his strength?
NO...AT THE AGE OF 50 DAVID LYONS DECIDED TO COMPETEIN A NPC BODYBUILDING COMPETITION!
David knew he could not do this alone, so he assembled a team he calls The Challenge Team. Putting this team together was no easy task. David needed dedicated, talented experts on his side to make this challenge a reality.
David is a courageous man who has rallied the support of many who know what he faces.Davidâ€™s doctors all told him that his pursuit of a bodybuilding title was sheer madness,especially at 50 years old...but if anyone could do it - he could. Davidâ€™s team is behind him100% and they are pushing him all the way.
On August 22, 2009, David competed in his first competition where he was awarded animpressive trophy for THE MOST INSPIRATIONAL BODYBUILDER!
David Lyons will keep competing, beat this disease and will not give up his dream. As David states, â€œThe two most important people in my life during The MS Bodybuilding Challenge will always be my wife, Kendra, who gives up her husband while I train and diet for these events and is willing to keep doing it until I retire (which, wonâ€™t be in the near future!). She is an inspiration to me as she has the compassion to deal with sick people all day as a nurse and then come home to help me shows the heart of a rare woman and a true blessing.
And God who, without His grace, love and strength, I could have never made it out of the hospital and on to that stage in 2009 and onto others. It is never by my might or power but by His will that I push forward.
""I might never win a bodybuilding contest with multiple sclerosis but I will win thebattle against MS.
This is not about me winning contests, it's about motivating other MS patientsto take control of their lives, get fit and beat the odds in every way possible. Noteveryone has to compete in a contest to win. You win by just getting up andfighting.
People assume that, if I could change my outcome in life, I would rather behealthy again and not have MS. The fact is that if I didn't have MS I would not behere today inspiring others and helping change lives. So, don't assume I would
rather not have MS. These are the cards I've been dealt and I accept this fate, Iwould not change it and I will continue to make a difference until the day I die.
We all have a choice, no matter what trials we face, to either lay down and loseor challenge the obstacles ahead and win. I choose to win. I encourage you to dothe same."" -David Lyons



The Impact

The MS Bodybuilding Challenge (MSBC) is more than the founder, David Lyonsâ€™, battle to
beat multiple sclerosis. It is a challenge for all those that have this disease and others to take charge of their lives, get fit and battle like a warrior.
The MSBC is dedicated to helping others fight and win by educating and inspiring MS patients and their families. We are passionate about empowering the MS community through health & fitness. Through events such as Mike Torchiaâ€™s Shape Up America/NBCâ€™s 4 Your Health Expo and our vision of working hand in hand with MS patients across the nation, The MSBC will reach millions of people and help change lives.
Our fundraiser, The MS Fitness Challenge, enables The MSBC to bring Certified FitnessTrainers into the homes of MS patients, free of cost, and coach both patient and familymembers how to fight this disease through health & fitness.
David, the President and Executive Producer with Andrew Bishop, CEO and Executive Producer of Bishop-Lyons Entertainment (BLE) have a feel for Hollywood and a desire for publicity. Bishop- Lyons Entertainment director and filmmaker John Spagnola has taken the reigns as he films Davidâ€™s daily life struggle with MS and his grueling workouts in the gym. BLE plans to use this footage to convince millions around the world that anyone with an intense enough desire can overcome even the most catastrophic challenge. In addition, David is writing a book which will be published as the companion to the film and will bring it to market.


What We Need & What You Get
To further help in the fight against MS, David is working hand-in-hand with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. A portion of your sponsorship dollars will be donated to the National MS Society to help multiple sclerosis patients by supporting research into its cause and cure.
The MS Bodybuilding Challenge is not just a journey of one man beating multiple sclerosis...itâ€™s a celebration of life. Dreams Do Come True... Be Part Of The Dream!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello. My name is Eva Usadi and I am the Founder and Director of Trauma and Resiliency Resources, Inc. and the daughter of a U.S. Army Signal Corps Veteran. Here is my story:<a href=""http://www.stripes.com/world-war-ii-vet-s-daughter-searches-for-the-things-her-father-carried-1.156786"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""World War II Vet's Daughter Searches for the Things Her Father Carried"">javascript:nicTemp();</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a trauma specialist and have been working with veterans for a long time. Warrior Camp has been carefully designed to address combat-related PTSD in an active duty military population. Future Warrior Camps will be held to address Military Sexual Trauma, Family Reintegration, and Vietnam Veterans.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The goal of TRR's Warrior Camp campaign is to enable us to hold our pilot Camp this coming summer and heal the trauma of war for 12 selected Active Duty Military members. Without this treatment, which we know to be effective, these warriors will likely continue to suffer from PTSD, and be at high risk for suicide.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is to complete our goal of raising $60,000 to fund the pilot Warrior Camp. All of this money goes to pay for food, lodging, arena fees and clinical services for 12 active duty warriors from Warriors in Transition Units (WTUs) - this comes to $5,000 per warrior for the initial camp. There will be 8 clinical staff involved in this very intensive treatment program. We also need to pay for a videographer and a research team to compile data.  The cost is high for this first Camp because we do not yet own our own facility, which is the ultimate goal so that we can run Camps year round. If we are not able to reach this goal by the deadline, we will continue to fundraise until we can fund the Camp. None of the money raised goes to anything else. We have no paid staff.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Long story short. My mum is a wheelchair user. I have to use a walking stick to get about(and have arm and joint problems) and my sister has a damaged knee and her back is bad from having to lift my mum about.</p>
<p>We can't get help from social services with care because they say we should do it and the hoist they're offering is one I can't use due to my own disabilities and I don't want my sister to be stuck caring for my mum full time.</p>
<p>We've found a hoist that I can use and best of all it's portable so we can use it in the house and even take it on holiday with us! It's just more expensive than we can afford as my mum is supporting both my sister and me at the moment and she doesn't earn a lot.</p>
<p>My mum's just been diagnosed with breast cancer and they're both feeling pretty down at the moment so I'd love to be able to give them some good news hope you can help us do it!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
We're looking for £2000 (about $3200) which will allow us to get the hoist we need (£1400) plus the slings for it (£200), delivery/set up costs and indiegogo's fee.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anything we get over what we need will be going to the charity my mum works for (Disability Law Service) which offers legal advice and support to disabled people in the UK check them out here <a href=""http://www.dls.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dls.org.uk</a>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Having this hoist would make a massive difference as it would allow my sister to be able to go away by herself (currently she can't because I can't look after my mum by myself) it would also help make sure neither of us injure ourselves lifting my mum as well as being much safer for my mum as she wouldn't be at risk of falling/being dropped. There's also the fact that my mum has just been diagnosed with breast cancer and the treatment for that is likely to make her feel tired and ill as well as possbly restricting her ability to move her arms which will make the way we move her now an impossibility.</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>THANKS!!!</strong></h3>
Every single penny will help us out. it's not a fashionable cause or a life saving one but it will make the lives of 3 people a bit easier and more bearable so please donate and spread the word.</div></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, we are Nick and Annabel from Australia and we have been married for 7 years. For about 5 years we have been trying to have children but we are unable to naturally due to Annabel being born without a womb. She found this out when she was just 17. We have known each other a long time before we got married and i knew about Annabel's condition right from the start. We married in the year 2005 and we knew that starting a family was going to be hard not just physically but mentally and financialy but if you want something bad enough you will try everything to get it. We knew other than adoption which we are already on the list and waiting that surrogacy was possible as Annabel still produces eggs. We have tried 6 times in Australia with a friend but all attempts have been unsuccessful. We have spent so much money, all our savings and this is really our last hope of having our own child. We have decided to go to India where we will undergo surrogacy with 2 surrogates. We desperately want to start a family  as we have so much love to give a child. We have been through so much and it has only made our love for each other stronger. We are both so strong and really need some help so please help us. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope to achieve success in India and we also want our own country to make surrogacy easier. The rights of the parents in Australia are tricky and it is so expensive. Not to mention the laws of surrogacy it is so hard and strict people that want to help us cant as they have to meet the laws of it all it is just so hard.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We actually need $30,000 for our Indian surrogacy but anything would help us. We need to pay $5,000 upfront and the rest is paid when the surrogate gets pregnant. We also need to pay for airfares and accommodation which is 16 days on our first visit and 3 weeks when the child is born.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know there are other couples out there wanting to do what we are attempting to do, and we need help from our health funds or government especially when it is no fault of our own. Annabel has a medical condition which we cannot fix, so this is it.<br/></p>

Working in the field of human health actually runs in the family. My father is a Consultant Vascular Surgeon based in The North of England and my mother is a Ward Matron!</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span>I
took a less hands-on approach to working in the medical field and currently work
full time for a Healthcare focused Market Intelligence and Strategy Consultancy in St Paul's.
Myself and The BioCrowd team then spend the rest of our time
getting the site up and running.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>As much of my work involves advising private and early stage
Biotechnology, Medical Device and Pharmaceutical companies on how best to
source outside investment I deduced a number of issues striking
these companies. Due to the fact that until a treatment has been deemed to be
clinically safe it cannot be administered to patients, the key
problem that these companies face is that they have limited sources of incoming
revenue until they have a treatment approved and selling on the open market, something
that we are aiming to change. </p> 
<p>Unfortunately getting a treatment to market costs hundreds of millions of pounds on average and for a company with no revenue, that is a lot of money! I have personally come across many companies with potentially ground breaking, market altering and life saving treatments that have unfortunately had to fold because they simply have not been able to source the funds needed to develop their treatments further. The world of healthcare investment is so competitive and investors are bombarded with offers and many great companies with fantastic business plans, great teams and a strong clinical product get lost in the crowd. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/767627/files/20140805065932-The_BC_Logo_png.png?1407247172"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>So I why not shake things up and open up the world of healthcare investment to the
masses? If we could do this then we could enable early stage healthcare
companies to source the investment that they need from alternative sources and
give themselves a fighting chance. Less folded companies leads to more approved treatments and more available remedies for friends, family members and patients around the world. So let me introduce you to The BioCrowd. A place where willing investors
can invest in early stage healthcare companies in exchange for equity,
promoting more healthcare innovation, benefiting human kind and hopefully
turning a small profit in the process.</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are My name is Udy Onwudike and I am founder and CEO of The BioCrowd. Working in the field of human health actually runs in the family. My father is a Consultant Vascular Surgeon based in The North of England and my mother is a Ward Matron!

I
took a less hands-on approach to working in the medical field and currently work
full time for a Healthcare focused Market Intelligence and Strategy Consultancy in St Paul's.
Myself and The BioCrowd team then spend the rest of our time
getting the site up and running.



As much of my work involves advising private and early stage
Biotechnology, Medical Device and Pharmaceutical companies on how best to
source outside investment I deduced a number of issues striking
these companies. Due to the fact that until a treatment has been deemed to be
clinically safe it cannot be administered to patients, the key
problem that these companies face is that they have limited sources of incoming
revenue until they have a treatment approved and selling on the open market, something
that we are aiming to change.  
Unfortunately getting a treatment to market costs hundreds of millions of pounds on average and for a company with no revenue, that is a lot of money! I have personally come across many companies with potentially ground breaking, market altering and life saving treatments that have unfortunately had to fold because they simply have not been able to source the funds needed to develop their treatments further. The world of healthcare investment is so competitive and investors are bombarded with offers and many great companies with fantastic business plans, great teams and a strong clinical product get lost in the crowd. 


So I why not shake things up and open up the world of healthcare investment to the
masses? If we could do this then we could enable early stage healthcare
companies to source the investment that they need from alternative sources and
give themselves a fighting chance. Less folded companies leads to more approved treatments and more available remedies for friends, family members and patients around the world. So let me introduce you to The BioCrowd. A place where willing investors
can invest in early stage healthcare companies in exchange for equity,
promoting more healthcare innovation, benefiting human kind and hopefully
turning a small profit in the process.

I am not alone in this venture and our team includes   
Jack Beadle (The Futures Trader) 
 Madu (The Consultant Vascular Surgeon) 
And our Non Exec-Director Andy (The CEO of property crowdfunding site Property Moose)

</p><p>Leonardo Konarsewski is a young
Brazilian (age 21) who in 2013 was diagnosed with cancer (Hodgkin’s

(Yes I should be healthy enough for surgery come October)THE BREAKDOWN
The Surgery Proper: $9,700
Skin Graft: $1,200 
Hotel: $3,000
Food: $225
Savings: $10,700
Total Remaining: $3425
THE WHY     Before I really had things figured out, before I had words for what I need, I knew that I needed SRS. It's not so much a goal as it is setting things right with my body. I want to spend as much of my life with the body I am meant to have, so the first chance I got to make the appointment, I jumped at it. I have done everything in my power to make this a reality, and I need your help to get past this final hurdle. THE ""WHAT YOU GET""     I have arranged several perks, ranging from bizarre to silly to strange, for those of you who are so kind to help me out a bit. I need every penny I can scrape up so most of them will be things I can make for you by hand. If you can't afford to help out monetarily (I know what that's like!), signal boosting, reblogging, sharing on facebook, or screaming out info at passing planes, would mean so much to me! I would really appreciate any help you can provide.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The largest importer of Dead Sea Salt and Manufacturer of Bath Salts in the country. I conceptualized and re-designed their entire flagship store currently still in operation. As part of my re-brand strategy I custom designed and implemented a sales process as well as developed products that would appeal to their base while crossing over into a higher end market.

This was a challenge considering the previous business in this space was an auto shop that had caught fire. We had to completely gut the building. I served as the project manager, worked with contractors and oversaw construction. I even built walls and wired the entire building with new electrical as an electricians apprentice. After construction I went on the be the General Manager.

It wasn't long before the apartment building staff were reporting low sales of their vending machine items and the woman we used to call ""the candy lady"" would stop replenishing her stock of blow pops and soda now that her customers were mine. </p><p style=""margin-bottom: 20px; padding: 0px; border-width: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"">I've managed several specialty retail stores and i must say that every one had their own challenges .

Anything from weather to customs holds can effect the job. The key is knowing how to manage and adjust to the situation. With years of experience as a General Manager, Consultant, Sales & Brand Manager on several large projects it was only natural for me to create my own brand.My last project was a complete re-brand for The San Francisco Bath Salt Co. on Pier 39 in San Francisco California. The largest importer of Dead Sea Salt and Manufacturer of Bath Salts in the country. I conceptualized and re-designed their entire flagship store currently still in operation. As part of my re-brand strategy I custom designed and implemented a sales process as well as developed products that would appeal to their base while crossing over into a higher end market. Before managing the re-brand of the store, I was the General Manager. Over all I worked a total of 4 years as a Consultant and Manager for this company in which time we hit all time record sales each year of my management.

<p>Hello. My name is Philip Malone, and my wife Jan and I are parents of a special needs girl named Shaelyn Lee (now 14 years). Shaelyn was born with a chromosomal deletion (14Q 32.3), resulting in mental  retardation.  She was also born with an extemely high and narrow pallet, not allowing her tongue to touch the roof of her mouth. This inhibits her ability to pronounce words and has been using a Dynavox V speaking device the last 10 years. Shaelyn must also sleep with a C-Pap machine because her mouth is so small it closes off her airway.</p>
<p>The surgery Shaelyn will have will widen her pallet, align her lower jaw and straighten her teeth. With in a year our hope is Shaelyn will be able to talk without the use of a machine and sleep safely at night without the C-Pap machine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my insurance will cover only a small portion of the medical expenses...leaving us with a significant medical bill. Your contributions will help Shaelyn to have a better quality of life as well as be more independent.</p>

BeHear NOW shares many of the same components as the leading hearing aids, but in contrast provides:

4x stronger Digital Signal Processor running more advanced algorithms
4x microphones for ultimate noise reduction


 
 
BeHear NOW supports a much wider hearing spectrum than hearing aids, well beyond human speech to include the realm of live music.

 
 
 
 



BeHear NOW is the first in a line of Wear & Hear concept products developed by Alango Technologies, Ltd. The product is ready and the first 300 units are waiting for the backers of this campaign.
We at Alango have been developing and implementing digital sound enhancement technologies in consumer goods for over 15 years. And, with tens of millions of users benefiting from Alango software integrated in various products, we know how to do it right! Our advanced algorithms reduce loud noises, remove annoying echo, and enhance speech to make it sound loud and clear.
About three years ago we decided to leverage this knowledge and pair it with existing consumer electronic devices to help you, and the people you care about, hear better for improved quality of life all around.

Features 

Built-in hearing test
Controls for hearing
Location preset selection
Volume
Real-time Best Sound Point (BSP) customization
Noise reduction setting


Controls for music play, phone call handling
Headset behavior settings
left/right ear balance
hearing mode defaults

Operating Systems

Android (version 4.4 and higher)
iOS (version 9 and higher)

Sample Screens



If members of the household (or its neighbors) can’t agree on the television volume, we recommend the BeHear NOW + HearLink transmitter bundle:

HearLink is a Bluetooth® transmitter that connects to the analog sound output found on most standard television sets and other audio devices. It sends the audio signal directly to the paired BeHear NOW headset, thus eliminating ambient noises, room reverberation, and other types of sound interference which hamper intelligibility of speech and music appreciation.
The BeHear NOW headset can be connected to the HearLink TV transmitter and to a smartphone at the same time. It allows you to watch TV with the ListenThrough technology activated (passing through important ambient sounds via the headset), and also get/make phone calls.
Main Features

Supports low latency audio streaming
Supports AVRCP commands (play/pause) for seamless operation with BeHear
AutoON (automatic ‘power on’ if charged from the television set USB port)
Battery operation for convenient use with portable players, mobile phones or computers
Lightweight and compact

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Dorshan Millhouse.  I am the founder of Pawsitive Therapeutic Consulting Services an 
Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) &amp; Animal-Assisted Activity (AAA) 
Organization.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What is Animal-Assisted Therapy? How does it work?  
In our case we specialize in Great Dane Therapy Dogs.  Professionals schedule a PTCS Therapy Dane to play an intricate roll in 
treatment sessions.  Patients or clients may be physically, socially, 
emotionally or cognitively challenged, and have specific goals/progress 
reports that will be updated throughout each session. Visitation is 
scheduled and worked around the individual’s needs.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition to Therapy work, PTCS volunteers time for Animal-Assisted Activity sessions. These 
visits can be spontaneous or scheduled.  Therapy Danes engage groups or 
individuals in a variety of social settings. Visitation times are 
considered flexible.  In Animal-Assisted Activities, no treatment is 
being performed or progress of a patient is being documented.  
Animal-Assisted Activities are fun and relaxed sessions where the 
Therapy Dane may entertain or just enjoy companionship.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By donating today, you<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>will be sponsoring the costs for our growing Dane in training.  Her training will allow her to participate in four programs we will be offering to the community.  These programs are FREE!!  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>Pawsitive Assistance Canine Therapy (PACT) Program</strong>: 
 Therapy Danes enter into a “pact” to remain loyal and supportive when 
asked to assist in matters of the legal system, as well as Child 
Protective Services, in providing emotional support and relaxation to a 
minor or disabled individual during court mandated situations.</p>
<p>         It's difficult to imagine the stress that children face when needing to testify in court.  Our Dane will be there before, after and if requested - on the stand during court sessions to lower the stress and anxiety levels during such a difficult process.  </p>
<p>         In addition, children in the foster care system have visitation with their biological families during times of separation.  Sometimes parents do not make it for the visits and it can be devastating for the children.  In other cases, children are filled with emotions and anxiety having to face their parents after being separated.  Our Dane can be there before and after visits to be that emotional cushion. <br/></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Tail Time Program</strong>: Therapy Danes will be reading companions to improve literacy skills within local academic institutions and libraries.</p>
<p>        As a parent of a high risk reader this program is a great motivational tool.  Our Dane can visit your school, or local library and become your child's reading buddy.  They literally read to the Dane.  Studies that have been done show that children have increased their reading level by two grades!  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Sergeant Paw Program:</strong> AAT and AAA for Veterans, 
Active Duty, and Retired Military men and women.  A Therapy Dane can 
make appearances at Deployment Departures, Tour of Duty Homecomings, and
 other military programs as requested.</p>
<p>       As a military family we can relate to the stress of multiple deployments.  Not every Soldier has a family to come home to.  That is why we felt it was important that our Dane attend Deployment Departures and Homecomings.  Allowing everyone that downtime needed before they get on the plane and as they adjust to the reality they are home.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Paw Adventures Program</strong>:   Therapy Dogs assist in 
physical, occupational, and speech therapy sessions assisting 
professionals to continue progressing with a patient’s goals to recovery
 and/or continued wellness.  Paw Adventures also provides support in 
airports, hospice, nursing homes, retirement communities, shelters, 
libraries, community events (ie: Special Olympics) and other outreach 
programs.</p>
<p>         Speech/Occupational/Physical Therapy are some examples of our Paw Adventures effort.  Speech Therapy has played a roll in our family life.  I have had the opportunity to talk to several families and therapists who have said how valuable animals are in therapy and how wonderful it would be to have one on site.  PTCS wants to make that possible.  Dogs are wonderful motivational tools.  If a child is hesitant to walk, they are more likely to want to walk to get closer to a dog.  If a child does not talk, they are more willing to be talkative about what they are seeing or touching.  If a child's muscle development and coordination aren't strong enough to brush their own hair, they can strengthen their muscles by brushing their Therapy Dog.    <br/></p>
<p>        <br/></p>
<p>These are programs that improve the quality of life and<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> you</span> can feel comfortable knowing you are making a difference in a person's life by helping us meet our goal today. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Dorshan Millhouse.  I am the founder of Pawsitive Therapeutic Consulting Services an 
Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) & Animal-Assisted Activity (AAA) 
Organization.

What is Animal-Assisted Therapy? How does it work?  
In our case we specialize in Great Dane Therapy Dogs.  Professionals schedule a PTCS Therapy Dane to play an intricate roll in 
treatment sessions.  Patients or clients may be physically, socially, 
emotionally or cognitively challenged, and have specific goals/progress 
reports that will be updated throughout each session. Visitation is 
scheduled and worked around the individual’s needs.

In addition to Therapy work, PTCS volunteers time for Animal-Assisted Activity sessions. These 
visits can be spontaneous or scheduled.  Therapy Danes engage groups or 
individuals in a variety of social settings. Visitation times are 
considered flexible.  In Animal-Assisted Activities, no treatment is 
being performed or progress of a patient is being documented.  
Animal-Assisted Activities are fun and relaxed sessions where the 
Therapy Dane may entertain or just enjoy companionship.

The Impact
By donating today, you will be sponsoring the costs for our growing Dane in training.  Her training will allow her to participate in four programs we will be offering to the community.  These programs are FREE!!  



Pawsitive Assistance Canine Therapy (PACT) Program: 
 Therapy Danes enter into a “pact” to remain loyal and supportive when 
asked to assist in matters of the legal system, as well as Child 
Protective Services, in providing emotional support and relaxation to a 
minor or disabled individual during court mandated situations.
         It's difficult to imagine the stress that children face when needing to testify in court.  Our Dane will be there before, after and if requested - on the stand during court sessions to lower the stress and anxiety levels during such a difficult process.  
         In addition, children in the foster care system have visitation with their biological families during times of separation.  Sometimes parents do not make it for the visits and it can be devastating for the children.  In other cases, children are filled with emotions and anxiety having to face their parents after being separated.  Our Dane can be there before and after visits to be that emotional cushion. 

Tail Time Program: Therapy Danes will be reading companions to improve literacy skills within local academic institutions and libraries.
        As a parent of a high risk reader this program is a great motivational tool.  Our Dane can visit your school, or local library and become your child's reading buddy.  They literally read to the Dane.  Studies that have been done show that children have increased their reading level by two grades!  

Sergeant Paw Program: AAT and AAA for Veterans, 
Active Duty, and Retired Military men and women.  A Therapy Dane can 
make appearances at Deployment Departures, Tour of Duty Homecomings, and
 other military programs as requested.
       As a military family we can relate to the stress of multiple deployments.  Not every Soldier has a family to come home to.  That is why we felt it was important that our Dane attend Deployment Departures and Homecomings.  Allowing everyone that downtime needed before they get on the plane and as they adjust to the reality they are home.

Paw Adventures Program:   Therapy Dogs assist in 
physical, occupational, and speech therapy sessions assisting 
professionals to continue progressing with a patient’s goals to recovery
 and/or continued wellness.  Paw Adventures also provides support in 
airports, hospice, nursing homes, retirement communities, shelters, 
libraries, community events (ie: Special Olympics) and other outreach 
programs.
         Speech/Occupational/Physical Therapy are some examples of our Paw Adventures effort.  Speech Therapy has played a roll in our family life.  I have had the opportunity to talk to several families and therapists who have said how valuable animals are in therapy and how wonderful it would be to have one on site.  PTCS wants to make that possible.  Dogs are wonderful motivational tools.  If a child is hesitant to walk, they are more likely to want to walk to get closer to a dog.  If a child does not talk, they are more willing to be talkative about what they are seeing or touching.  If a child's muscle development and coordination aren't strong enough to brush their own hair, they can strengthen their muscles by brushing their Therapy Dog.    
        
These are programs that improve the quality of life and you can feel comfortable knowing you are making a difference in a person's life by helping us meet our goal today.

</h3></div>","SummaryThis is a science project to perform ""before"" and ""after"" testing on the gut biomes of a family of four in response to a diet supplemented with resistant starch.The positive effect of resistant starch on blood glucose control has been the source of many recent anecdotal reports among health bloggers on the internet. The mechanism is not entirely clear, but evidence suggests better feeding and nutrition of symbiotic bacteria in the gut microbiome is causative.The goal of this project is to measure and compare the effects of resistant starch dose-responses on gut biome in as reasonably controlled a manner as possible by selecting an otherwise typical and healthy family that lives and eats together.
A secondary goal of this project is to provide a proof-of-concept and, perhaps, a template for future crowd-sourced, small-scale diet and health experiments.

Methods
I will purchase two ""Microbes for Four"" swab kits from the American Biome Project.
At the start of the project four members of our family, two adults and two children, will provide a stool swab.
Over the course of a 6 week study period I will maintain a food journal for each participant and provide a daily diet supplement of resistant starch in the form of Bob's Red Mill Unmodified Potato Starch. Each participant will follow a unique supplementation regimen:
a) adult 1 - 2 TBSP mixed in water, consumed on an empty stomach
b) adult 2 - 4 TBSP mixed in water, consumed on an empty stomach
c) child 1 - 1 TBSP potato starch plus 1 TSP whole psyllium husk mixed into yogurt
d) child 2 - 1 TBSP potato starch mixed into yogurt
At the conclusion of the study period the four test subjects will provide a second stool swab for comparison purposes. The lab results from both swabs will be shared publicly on the internet.
Our current diet is almost entirely home-cooked meals somewhere between primal/paleo-ish and WAPF. None of us has supplemented with potato starch previously. We do eat, a few times a week up to almost daily, an heirloom strain of viili yogurt that I culture myself. More details, including a fairly typical week of meals for us are recorded at the project blog.
Stretch Goals
If the project is over-funded I will perform additional ""before"" & ""after"" lab tests in consultation with Dr. BG from the blog Animal Pharm. She has worked extensively with others on rehabilitating their gut biome and is an expert in the practice. I will also be providing to her a $50 honorarium for her help, advice, and assistance.
As an example of additional testing, we are looking into additional profiling that would cover non-bacterial micro-organisms like protozoa, fungi, and parasites. Another possibility dependent on over-funding would be biome testing from additional service providers to document, compare, and contrast the different results and reporting methods of different lab services.
I may also do a limited amount of blood glucose testing using an OTC blood-glucose meter and disposable test strips.
We will do these for one or more of the study participants as financial resources allow. 
As of this writing, the exact costs for the additional tests are unknown so I can't give precise goal levels for each set of additional tests. Dr. BG is graciously and actively researching the available options and their associated costs.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

MOMENT</b></p>
<p>Michele’s doctor had been telling her for years that she
needed to lose weight or she would become diabetic.  She had actually been having all sorts of
health issues, i.e. acid reflux, hiatal hernia, obstructed bowels, swollen feet
&amp; ankles, you name it she had it.</p>
<p>In July of 2012, she found herself literally rolling to the
floor on her knees in the mornings just to get out of bed. That’s when she knew
it was time.</p>
<p>Michele said “I knew I was fat but I just didn’t call it
obese or overweight”</p>
<p>While being obese, Michele was tired, sore and insecure
about herself.  She was embarrassed not
just for herself but also for her kids.  Michele
didn’t want to be around people and would tend to avoid going to certain
functions.</p>
<p>Michele will tell you that some aspects of her journey was
challenging but not difficult, like disciplining herself to eat right when
those around her were not. “... but with the help of <b>Kurt Dixon </b>of <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bodyrefinedinc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Body Refined Inc.</a></b> I
learned what to do when those around me aren’t eating healthy” Michele said. </p>
<p>She has learned so much in this journey to better her health.
She said… “Realizing what I could look like played a key factor in why I wanted
more than just losing enough weight to stop the ailments.  I wanted my body to look a lot more toned and
defined.” </p>
<p>“I learned that my body functions so much better by eating
the right foods and at the right times. 
I understand my body is not a dumping ground for all these foods they
put out. Just because it’s there and may seem convenient doesn’t mean I have to
eat it. I now understand what my body needs to fuel itself.”</p>
<p>She has a lot of support from her three daughters, sister
and parents. She has many friends who have supported her journey but she has
also gained some new friends &amp; supporters, like 2013 NPC Max Muscle Classic
Figure Champion, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/XelleFit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Laurelle Martineau</a>.
Elle has witnessed her transformation first hand, she says:</p>
<p><b><i>“Not every day I have the pleasure of meeting someone who is naturally
driven as Michelle. Her fierce drive for excellence has led the way to her
success today. Michelle’s dedication discipline and determination has showed me
that no dream is too big or no goal is out of reach. Watching her develop and
excel on her fitness journey has truly been inspiring.”</i></b></p>
<p><b> “</b>Some family and friends were a little
concerned about me losing too much weight but I realize they don’t understand
the body and what we are supposed to look like. 
Just watch old episodes of Soul Train. Over the years, we have been
conditioned to think that plump, thick, chunky is ok BUT it’s not.”</p>
<p>I have tried to lose weight several times on my own.  I had dvd’s, I tried walking in my school’s
gym, I even had one of those silver space looking suits (the ones that make you
sweat. lol)  If you noticed everything I
tried was related to the physical part of losing weight.  Body Refined Inc. taught me that is only 20%
of the process the other 80% is nutrition. 
That’s right what I was consuming on a daily (sometimes a hourly)
basis.  Compared to the other times I got
the right HELP!  Someone who guided me
with nutrition tips and how to do the exercises properly.</p>
<p><b>THIS JOURNEY REQUIRED
A HEALTH SPECIALIST, A COACH… NOT A TRAINER</b></p>
<p>Fast forward from December 2012 (the start of her journey)
to September 2013….. 80+ pounds down, 30% body fat gone and a total of 83 ¼ inch
reduction from various parts of her body. Most noticeably in the mid-section.</p>
<p>I met Kurt Dixon of <b><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/bodyrefinedinc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Body Refined Inc.</a></b> in November of 2012.
I got Kurt's number from a friend and I gave him a call. I left a message and
within minutes he returned my call. We set up a time and date for my initial
consultation. During the consultation Kurt asked very specific questions
pertaining to my health and what I had been told by my doctor. I completed a
survey which he explained would give him an idea of how to help us (he &amp; I)
design a program just for me.</p>
<p>During the consultation he provided me with a wealth of
information which included research and statistics about obesity in women,
ailments associated with poor health/nutrition and lack of physical activity.</p>
<p>The program Kurt designed for me began at a very slow pace
and it was geared for my body type, strength and endurance. Over time, I have
become stronger physically and mentally. I am running, which I did not do even
before my weight gain. I have also learned what my body needs and how to read
the labels on food products. I even learned how to shop in the grocery store, yes,
I had to learn how to grocery shop because all I use to buy was everything
instant, sweet, salty and saturated with fat.</p>
<p>Kurt has provided me with one-on-one nutrition and fitness
training with strong emphasis on NUTRITION.</p>
<p><b>“<i>The first day I met with Michele, her drive and intensity was
noticeable within minutes of the initial consultation. She listened intently to
everything I was explaining to her about the changes in nutrition and the
exercise routines that we would engage in over the next several months. From
the start, I explained that there is a good chance there will be excess skin
but let’s do our best to eat clean and take this whole weight-loss process slow
to allow the skin to pull back as much as possible. Which it did but
unfortunately, not in the abdominal area.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>So, this procedure that she needs to get done is far better than it
could have been if we had rushed this process.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I hope all who are reading this find it in their heart (and change
purse) to help Michele to get this much needed procedure done. Congratulations
Michele and I am definitely contributing to this last hurdle that we have!”</i></b></p>
<p><b>EXTREME WEIGHT LOSS
LEADS TO EXCESSIVE SAGGING SKIN</b></p>
<p>Losing a large amount of weight as a result of weight loss
through diet and exercise is a major accomplishment that will enhance your
health, your outlook on life, and your appearance.</p>
<p>Michele has achieved great weight loss but an 83 ¼ inch
difference from the start of her journey to now has left her with a large
amount of heavy, loose folds of skin around the abdomen area. </p>
<p>Extreme weight loss can cause skin to sag and lose
elasticity as a result of being stretched for a long period of time. After
significant weight loss, the skin often fails to shrink back to its former size
and shape.</p>
<p>The excess skin can cause hygiene and medical problems.
Chronic skin-on-skin contact can result in rashes and other sores that can lead
to infection. In addition, excess skin can be a cosmetic issue. People who have
lost a large amount of weight often want their bodies to reflect the new, more
positive image they have of themselves. Many times, the only way to remove
excess skin left after extensive weight loss is through body-contouring plastic
surgery.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, we are all very proud of Michele for
this significant achievement.</p>
<p>And while all this progress is inspiring and dramatic for
her as well as others, it also created some depressing feelings.  Even though there was a new, improved body
laying underneath, the excess amount of sagging skin is completely masking the
hard work that she has put into her journey.</p>
<p>As you can see from her pictures, her abdomen looks like a
deflated balloon.</p>
<p>Here we are, 2014, 15 months later, the final step to
completing this journey….. Find a plastic surgeon to remove the excess skin and
unveil a body that she can admire in and out of clothes.</p>
<p><b>THE PLASTIC SURGEON</b></p>
<p>Michele consulted with a couple plastic surgeons, reviewing
before and after pictures of their patients, and decided to hire <b><a href=""http://www.aasurgery.com/about-us/plastic-surgeon-annapolis-md/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr.
Marcia V. Ormsby’s</a></b>. a preeminent female plastic surgeon and cosmetic
surgery specialist based in Maryland at <b><a href=""http://www.aasurgery.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Annapolis Aesthetic Surgery, Inc.</a></b></p>
<p><b>Michele says “When I
first met Dr. Ormsby, we conducted the initial consultation in her office where
she explained the entire procedure a long with having to do liposuction but
when we went to her examination room for her to do the examination on my body, she
was shocked at what she saw. I guess my clothes were big because all kept
saying was “wow, you are so tiny”. She was more elated when she realized that
my procedure would not require liposuction and it was just going to be a skin
removal procedure. “ </b></p>
<p><b>HOW TO PAY FOR THE
SURGERY (THE CROWDFUNDING GOAL)</b></p>
<p>Michele tried borrowing from her retirement account. Tried
to get a personal loan. She even asked her medical insurance company. As you
can see, she has tried all options including family.</p>
<p>So, the next option are DONATIONS. </p>
<p>The goal is to raise $11,500 to cover the cost of the
surgery recommended by Dr. Marcia V. Ormsby, “<b>Abdominoplasty”.  </b>This will
cover the surgical procedure, Anesthesia, and the use of the facility.</p>
<p>Abdominoplasty involves removing excess skin and tightening
of the underlying abdominal muscles. An incision is made just above the pubic
area from hip to hip, occasionally extending to the back. Sometimes a vertical
incision is necessary, too. Dr. Ormsby has determined that Michele needs only a
panniculectomy, which is simply the removal of excess skin. No liposuction
which has greatly reduced the cost. Although this is primarily a hygiene and
medical concern for Michele, having the abdominal muscles tightened or
extending the incision to the back is most often considered cosmetic and this
is why her medical insurance will not cover the cost.</p>
<p>If Michele raises more than her goal of $11,500 for the surgery,
she will “pay it forward” to another hard working person who also needs a
similar surgery.</p>
<p><b>PLEASE SHARE THIS
STORY</b></p>
<p>If you cannot help with money, it would be immensely helpful
if you could forward her personal story to your family, friends and business
colleagues via your social network circles.

</b>via e-mail or social media posts to help Michele complete her journey.</p>

her abdomen as it is now, with the excessive skin. Any and all help would be

<p>“I watched my daughter Michele gain weight over the years.
Each time I saw her, she seemed to put on a few more pounds. She is a pretty
girl but the weight bothered me. Even her father said “Michele needs to do
something about her weight.”  She would
complain about always feeling tired and her feet hurting. I did not want to say
anything because I did not want to make her feel bad. I would say to myself of
course, she looks like a round butter ball. She would find an excuse not to go
to family functions. One day she showed up at with a large pink bag full of
plastic containers. I asked her, “what's all that?” she said her food, she was
on a diet. Each time I saw her, I saw a difference in her weight. I saw her
determination and dedication toward a healthy lifestyle. She motivated me to
begin a long term weight loss. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p>You will always have our support and you can count on mom

<p><b>DEBRA NOBLES –
MICHELE’S YOUNGER SISTER, BRONX, NY</b></p>
<p>“For the past few years, I’ve watched my sister struggle
with her weight. She experienced several unfortunate events in her life which
caused her to become depressed. She found comfort in unhealthy eating
habits.  Her favorite, Entenmann’s
chocolate chip cookies was her comfort food. 
During this period in her life, I really did not know how this was
affecting her body and I even gave her a nickname “fatty fat cakes”.  But as the years went by, she would complain
about how tired she was and suffered several medical issues dealing with her
stomach.  Her doctors advised her to lose
weight and to begin eating healthier. About 1 year ago she was introduced to
Kurt Dixon of Body Refined Inc. and this is when her journey to weight lose
began.  With the guidance of Mr. Dixon,
she was able to completely change her lifestyle.  With determination and will power, she
learned how to shop, eat and live, a healthier lifestyle and within a few weeks
the change began, not only did this change her physically it also did
emotionally; It brought the happy go lucky person I grew up with back to
life.  And I will always be proud to be
her little sister.</p>

I got Kurt's number from a friend and I gave him a call. I left a message and
within minutes he returned my call. We set up a time and date for my initial
consultation. During the consultation Kurt asked very specific questions
pertaining to my health and what I had been told by my doctor. I completed a
survey which he explained would give him an idea of how to help us (he & I)
design a program just for me.
During the consultation he provided me with a wealth of
information which included research and statistics about obesity in women,
ailments associated with poor health/nutrition and lack of physical activity.
The program Kurt designed for me began at a very slow pace
and it was geared for my body type, strength and endurance. Over time, I have
become stronger physically and mentally. I am running, which I did not do even
before my weight gain. I have also learned what my body needs and how to read
the labels on food products. I even learned how to shop in the grocery store, yes,
I had to learn how to grocery shop because all I use to buy was everything
instant, sweet, salty and saturated with fat.
Kurt has provided me with one-on-one nutrition and fitness
training with strong emphasis on NUTRITION.
“The first day I met with Michele, her drive and intensity was
noticeable within minutes of the initial consultation. She listened intently to
everything I was explaining to her about the changes in nutrition and the
exercise routines that we would engage in over the next several months. From
the start, I explained that there is a good chance there will be excess skin
but let’s do our best to eat clean and take this whole weight-loss process slow
to allow the skin to pull back as much as possible. Which it did but
unfortunately, not in the abdominal area.
So, this procedure that she needs to get done is far better than it
could have been if we had rushed this process.
I hope all who are reading this find it in their heart (and change
purse) to help Michele to get this much needed procedure done. Congratulations
Michele and I am definitely contributing to this last hurdle that we have!”
EXTREME WEIGHT LOSS
LEADS TO EXCESSIVE SAGGING SKIN
Losing a large amount of weight as a result of weight loss
through diet and exercise is a major accomplishment that will enhance your
health, your outlook on life, and your appearance.
Michele has achieved great weight loss but an 83 ¼ inch
difference from the start of her journey to now has left her with a large
amount of heavy, loose folds of skin around the abdomen area. 
Extreme weight loss can cause skin to sag and lose
elasticity as a result of being stretched for a long period of time. After
significant weight loss, the skin often fails to shrink back to its former size
and shape.
The excess skin can cause hygiene and medical problems.
Chronic skin-on-skin contact can result in rashes and other sores that can lead
to infection. In addition, excess skin can be a cosmetic issue. People who have
lost a large amount of weight often want their bodies to reflect the new, more
positive image they have of themselves. Many times, the only way to remove
excess skin left after extensive weight loss is through body-contouring plastic
surgery.
As you can imagine, we are all very proud of Michele for
this significant achievement.
And while all this progress is inspiring and dramatic for
her as well as others, it also created some depressing feelings.  Even though there was a new, improved body
laying underneath, the excess amount of sagging skin is completely masking the
hard work that she has put into her journey.
As you can see from her pictures, her abdomen looks like a
deflated balloon.
Here we are, 2014, 15 months later, the final step to
completing this journey….. Find a plastic surgeon to remove the excess skin and
unveil a body that she can admire in and out of clothes.
THE PLASTIC SURGEON
Michele consulted with a couple plastic surgeons, reviewing
before and after pictures of their patients, and decided to hire Dr.
Marcia V. Ormsby’s. a preeminent female plastic surgeon and cosmetic
surgery specialist based in Maryland at Annapolis Aesthetic Surgery, Inc.
Michele says “When I
first met Dr. Ormsby, we conducted the initial consultation in her office where
she explained the entire procedure a long with having to do liposuction but
when we went to her examination room for her to do the examination on my body, she
was shocked at what she saw. I guess my clothes were big because all kept
saying was “wow, you are so tiny”. She was more elated when she realized that
my procedure would not require liposuction and it was just going to be a skin
removal procedure. “ 
HOW TO PAY FOR THE
SURGERY (THE CROWDFUNDING GOAL)
Michele tried borrowing from her retirement account. Tried
to get a personal loan. She even asked her medical insurance company. As you
can see, she has tried all options including family.
So, the next option are DONATIONS. 
The goal is to raise $11,500 to cover the cost of the
surgery recommended by Dr. Marcia V. Ormsby, “Abdominoplasty”.  This will
cover the surgical procedure, Anesthesia, and the use of the facility.
Abdominoplasty involves removing excess skin and tightening
of the underlying abdominal muscles. An incision is made just above the pubic
area from hip to hip, occasionally extending to the back. Sometimes a vertical
incision is necessary, too. Dr. Ormsby has determined that Michele needs only a
panniculectomy, which is simply the removal of excess skin. No liposuction
which has greatly reduced the cost. Although this is primarily a hygiene and
medical concern for Michele, having the abdominal muscles tightened or
extending the incision to the back is most often considered cosmetic and this
is why her medical insurance will not cover the cost.
If Michele raises more than her goal of $11,500 for the surgery,
she will “pay it forward” to another hard working person who also needs a
similar surgery.
PLEASE SHARE THIS
STORY
If you cannot help with money, it would be immensely helpful
if you could forward her personal story to your family, friends and business
colleagues via your social network circles. 
You can send this link: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/final-step-in-michele-s-weight-loss-journey
via e-mail or social media posts to help Michele complete her journey.
It took a lot of courage for Michele to post the pictures of
her abdomen as it is now, with the excessive skin. Any and all help would be
greatly appreciated.
NOTES FROM MICHELE’S
FAMILY, FRIENDS & SUPPORTERS:
DJOBS LYONS – BIKRAM
YOGA INSTRUCTOR, WASHINGTON, DC
“If will and determination had a face? It would show you
Michele Taylor. I've known the Mother, Teacher and Friend for some years now,
and have been an eye-witness to tremendous progress in reaching her fitness
goals. I believe a big part of her motivation came from watching her daughters
taking dance classes. I would encourage her to participate during yoga &
warm-up. Even during her heaviest, never intimidated, she would try doing the
postures. Now half the weight, Michele is a regular student of mine at Bikram
Yoga”
ELOISE ""MAE"" NOBLES –
MICHELE’S MOM, WILSON, NC
“I watched my daughter Michele gain weight over the years.
Each time I saw her, she seemed to put on a few more pounds. She is a pretty
girl but the weight bothered me. Even her father said “Michele needs to do
something about her weight.”  She would
complain about always feeling tired and her feet hurting. I did not want to say
anything because I did not want to make her feel bad. I would say to myself of
course, she looks like a round butter ball. She would find an excuse not to go
to family functions. One day she showed up at with a large pink bag full of
plastic containers. I asked her, “what's all that?” she said her food, she was
on a diet. Each time I saw her, I saw a difference in her weight. I saw her
determination and dedication toward a healthy lifestyle. She motivated me to
begin a long term weight loss. Keep up the good work.
You will always have our support and you can count on mom
& dad to help you get this procedure done.”
DEBRA NOBLES –
MICHELE’S YOUNGER SISTER, BRONX, NY
“For the past few years, I’ve watched my sister struggle
with her weight. She experienced several unfortunate events in her life which
caused her to become depressed. She found comfort in unhealthy eating
habits.  Her favorite, Entenmann’s
chocolate chip cookies was her comfort food. 
During this period in her life, I really did not know how this was
affecting her body and I even gave her a nickname “fatty fat cakes”.  But as the years went by, she would complain
about how tired she was and suffered several medical issues dealing with her
stomach.  Her doctors advised her to lose
weight and to begin eating healthier. About 1 year ago she was introduced to
Kurt Dixon of Body Refined Inc. and this is when her journey to weight lose
began.  With the guidance of Mr. Dixon,
she was able to completely change her lifestyle.  With determination and will power, she
learned how to shop, eat and live, a healthier lifestyle and within a few weeks
the change began, not only did this change her physically it also did
emotionally; It brought the happy go lucky person I grew up with back to
life.  And I will always be proud to be
her little sister.

You will definitely getting a donation from your
little sister, I love you!”",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Proper hydration leaves you feeling better during and after the run, speeding recovery, reducing lactic acid build up, minimizing cramping, and is the number one beauty aid on the planet. Support this campaign.</p>
<p>Sadly many runners develop poor hydration habits since there is nothing on the market that is simple, easy to use and does not hinder their natural body movement during running. Because of this many runners are extremely slow in reaching their fitness goals, or worse yet, injure themselves without realizing hydration is the culprit. Proper use of the <strong>Hydro-Run™</strong> system ensures poor hydration is not the cause of injury or lack of progress in hitting fitness goals. Support this campaign.</p>

<h3>Help us Fund Safe Passage Tennis Program of Los Angeles</h3>
<p>Thanks for visiting our campaign. This campaign is being launched and is very important for the continued existence of ""Safe Passage Tennis Program"" a very special after-school tennis program for at-risk youth in Los Angeles California. The magnitude of your contirbutions is immersurable.</p>
<h3><strong>About Safe Passage Tennis Program</strong></h3>
<p>The Los Angeles Safe Passage Tennis Program was started by the Arthur Ashe Safe Passage Tennis Foundation in memory of legendary tennis champion and humanitarian in 1995 two years after his death.</p>
<p>Our mission is to create a ""Safe Passage"" for youth making the journey into productive adulthood by using tennis as the vehicle for building self-esteem and character. Discipline, confidence and independent thinking are stressed.</p>
<p>See our alumni list: <a href=""http://www.safepassagetennis.com/program-graduates.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Safe Passage Tennis Program Graduates</a></p>
<p>Ultimately, Arthur Ashe hoped to accomplish with Safe Passage an ever growing program that teaches and develops children's interpersonal and social skills through exposure to tennis. The organization strives to develop skills that will better prepare children for their future by focusing on decision-making skills, problem solving, self-esteem, physical fitness and teamwork. The development of a curriculum based on sportsmanship, not winning or losing, is key to maintaining a respect for self and game.</p>
<p>In 1997 the after-school tennis program was acquired by the Los Angeles Junior Chamber of Commerce (LAJCC). Unfortunately in 2011 the (LAJCC) after the downturn in the ecomomy and facing financial straits decided to discontinue its support of the after school tennis program in December of 2011 after 14 years. We are very thankful to the Los Angeles Junior Chamber of Commerce for it's support and continuing the legacy of Arthur Ashe.</p>
<div class=""quote"" style=""display: block;"">
<div class=""attribution"">Brock Foundation took over the Safe Passage Tennis Program in January of 2012. Safe Passage Tennis addresses the alarming problems of peak juvenile crime, and risking behavior which are most prevalent for youth ages 13 to 18 during after-school hours of 3pm and 7pm. Safe Passage Tennis was created to address these problems and more such as childhood obesity and juvenile delinquency.</div>
<div class=""attribution""> </div>
<div class=""attribution"">In 2012 we were able to service over 170 students in the preventive after-school tennis program.

<p>Paula Martínez, una de las fundadoras y profesora de Yogahora inició su camino en el yoga hace más de 10 años, como pasa muchas veces, por casualidad, su primera motivación fue mejorar una escoliosis que padecía. Después de un tiempo practicando yoga, descubrió que su escoliosis había remitido y que estaría enamorada del yoga de por vida. Empezó a practicar más intensamente hasta que tomó la decisión de formarse como profesora de yoga para así poder compartir sus beneficios y ayudar a otras personas como la habían ayudado a ella. Después de un tiempo dando clases presenciales, pensó que ayudar a varios grupos de personas de manera presencial estaba muy bien, pero ¿Y si pudiera ayudar a miles de personas al mismo tiempo? Y ahí nació el proyecto Yogahora, de la necesidad de compartir los beneficios del yoga con la mayor cantidad posible de gente, Naciendo una comunidad internacional, multicultural y abierta de practicantes de yoga de todas las edades y condiciones.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Diabetes,
heart disease, cancer, obesity and stress are the fatal five. They shorten the
lives of millions of black women and their loved ones each year.</span></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Help us
beat the fatal five by taking a new approach to eliminating health disparities
in engaging ways.</p>
<p><b>Your five:</b> Donate at least $5 (or a multiple of 5: $50, $500, $5,000), and introduce 5
friends to Fierce.</p>
<p><b>Our five:</b> We’ll make a difference for black
women in 5 ways — at the very least: </p>
<p>1. <b>Telling Your Story:</b> Fierce will become
home to a story bank where black women can share their stories of health,
healing and triumph. We will always share the best that science has to offer,
but we want to hear about your experiences in your words. We want to know what
works for you and your family. Our goal is to increase understanding about what
harms and heals black women and their families.</p>
<p>2. <b>Finding the Truth: </b>Ever read a survey
about black women’s lives and well-being and wonder who on earth they were
talking to?  Well, we want to talk to
women like you. Existing research tells only part of our health story. Working
with major foundations, we will initiate surveys that will uncover many of the
trends that have an impact on our health happiness. </p>
<p>3. <b>Digging Deep:</b> We will expand our <i>Living Well</i> investigative reporting series
to ask top journalists to answer the unasked questions about health and
well-being. </p>
<p>4. <b>Gathering Together:</b> We will grow our
Fierce Circle of Sisters to bring women together for common interests and
concerns through large and small meet-ups and get-togethers on fibroids to
fitness, special events, spa trips or other girlfriend getaways </p>
<p>5.  <b>Harnessing
Technology</b>: Fierce will use social media, apps and other tech tools to help
you stay healthy, fit and fabulous! </p>

life that cannot be defined by narrow stereotypes. She has arrived or is
striving to fulfill her dreams, because she’s proactive. Determined to be in
charge of her well-being, she is in search of real-life solutions to wellness
and fitness in ways that resonate with her culture, her heritage, her world.
Our target audience is 35 and older, but also includes younger Fierce women. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>We are ready to take Fierce to the next level so that we can
more effectively help our target audience. We’re concerned about the many people
in our community who have a poor quality of life because of health issues  and especially those who are dying
prematurely. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our strategy combines a <b><u>holistic</u></b> approach with <b><u>real-life solutions</u></b> to promote
healthy lifestyles. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This is important, because
African American women are less likely to exercise or eat healthy, while
enduring higher levels of stress (financial and otherwise) along with the
health disparities. Unfortunately, we’re also less likely to receive
cutting-edge treatments or possess the health literacy necessary to  to adopt healthy practices, follow medical
regimens or seek and demand the best care.</span></p>
<p>Fortunately, some of this is changing. At Fierce, we have the experience and track record to make a difference. We know how to have fun, when to be serious and what it takes to empower, enlighten and entertain busy women and their families.   </p>

<h3>Why We're So Fiercely Motivated</h3>
<p>Once you realize the difference that your work can make, you want to do more. That is why Fierce is a mission fueled by social entrepreneurship. We started Fierce, because we’ve been inspired by the impact that we've had on women and their families through our decades of health journalism. </p>
<p>In meeting women through our travels and receiving notes of thanks (and even hugs), they’ve shared how we’ve inspired them to adopt healthy habits — whether it’s losing weight, improving nutritional habits, exercising more or making appointments with friends for breast exams. But they have also asked us to do more — to find new and creative ways to support their journey toward a healthier lifestyle. Fierce is our answer to that call. </p>
<p> We’ve worked out with some of these women. We’ve shared laughs as well as tears. And we’ve come clean about our own ups and downs — like giving in to potato chips and popcorn and an excuse to miss another workout.  </p>
<p>Fierce is for black women by black women. Because we’re part of the audience. We intimately understand the challenges we all face from experiences we've had in our own lives and in our families. We know what works and what doesn’t. And we have the expertise to back it up with highly credible, compelling and accessible reporting on the most important medical research, health and social issues for our audience.</p></span></span></div>

The Impact 

We are ready to take Fierce to the next level so that we can
more effectively help our target audience. We’re concerned about the many people
in our community who have a poor quality of life because of health issues  and especially those who are dying
prematurely. 


Our strategy combines a holistic approach with real-life solutions to promote
healthy lifestyles. This is important, because
African American women are less likely to exercise or eat healthy, while
enduring higher levels of stress (financial and otherwise) along with the
health disparities. Unfortunately, we’re also less likely to receive
cutting-edge treatments or possess the health literacy necessary to  to adopt healthy practices, follow medical
regimens or seek and demand the best care.
Fortunately, some of this is changing. At Fierce, we have the experience and track record to make a difference. We know how to have fun, when to be serious and what it takes to empower, enlighten and entertain busy women and their families.

Why We're So Fiercely Motivated
Once you realize the difference that your work can make, you want to do more. That is why Fierce is a mission fueled by social entrepreneurship. We started Fierce, because we’ve been inspired by the impact that we've had on women and their families through our decades of health journalism. 
In meeting women through our travels and receiving notes of thanks (and even hugs), they’ve shared how we’ve inspired them to adopt healthy habits — whether it’s losing weight, improving nutritional habits, exercising more or making appointments with friends for breast exams. But they have also asked us to do more — to find new and creative ways to support their journey toward a healthier lifestyle. Fierce is our answer to that call. 
 We’ve worked out with some of these women. We’ve shared laughs as well as tears. And we’ve come clean about our own ups and downs — like giving in to potato chips and popcorn and an excuse to miss another workout.  
Fierce is for black women by black women. Because we’re part of the audience. We intimately understand the challenges we all face from experiences we've had in our own lives and in our families. We know what works and what doesn’t. And we have the expertise to back it up with highly credible, compelling and accessible reporting on the most important medical research, health and social issues for our audience.

random deletion of 25 to 28 of these, resulting in some physical and intellectual disabilities but coupled with a mesmerizing affinity for music,

<dir>
<font size=""4""><p><strong><font size=""5"">Here is my story,</font></strong></p>
</font><font size=""4""></font><p><font size=""4"">My name is Amy Simmons and I am 29 years old. I was born in Oct of 1982. I am from a small town in West Virginia called Cairo. It all started when i was 3 years old. I had my first grand-mal seizure at that age while i was taking a nap in pre-school. I went 2 years before I had my second one at the age of 5. After that I was seizure free for 8 years until the age of 13. When I had my third seizure and my worse one out of the three. But just as the same with the first two, I didnt have another one for 8 years to come. Until the age of 21 in Feb of 2004. I was told it was 4 in the morning when I let out a loud high pitch screech squeal. And I started having a grand-mal seizure that would change my life forever. Until that time the medicine I had been on had been controlling the seizures. But shortly after having that seizure I started having them on a daily basis. It wasn't and isn't always the grand-mal seizures I have, but all of them are critical in the damage that they do. I have had as many as 10 seizures in one day. The reason I say in the damage that they do is because, when I have them I stop breathing and if standing I lose my balance and fall. Meaning the lack of oxygen causes brain damage, which I have loss most of my memory because of having so many seizures. I can do something yesterday and not remember doing it the next day and sometimes not remember that day. My neurologist told me that he has nothing left that he can do for me, but if I quit having the seizure my memory might get better. But thats not the only damage that it has done I have now broken my nose twice from falling while having seizures. Also I have had to have staples and stitches twice this year. Not to mention the bruising not only on the body as well as on the face. And going out into public and people looking at me and my boyfriend like he beats me. Not knowing what the bruises is from. But is isn't just the physical toll it has on the body, but it has emotional also. Because now I am never by myself someone always has to be with me because they happen and I do not have time to prepare for them. So instead of going to bathroom and having privacy someone has to go with me. I can't go make me something to eat because of them. I am 29 and have to be watched like I am a small child. And then that doesn't always help because even with that I fell and had to get staples and stitches. Just them turning their head for a second it happened.  Me and my boyfriend was in the kitchen cooking he turned his head to get a fork, and I had fallen and split my head.  I had to get 6 staples and 3 stitches.  Then 3 months later we got out car at my parents and he reached in the car to get the dog, and before he stood back up I had a seizure and fell.  I had to get staples again that time for spliting my head on the asphalt.  I want to have a family but with my condition I cannot have kids and be able to watch them. I would injure them if I was holding them and fell with them. So I am at the last resort that I know to do, and that is to ask for help from anyone who reads this. I cannot afford to see the specialist or the testing that needs to be done. Because of the seizures I cannot work cause of the fear of hurting myself or someone else. There is only 3 specialist in the field of doctor that I need to see on the east coast. One is in New York, another in Florida, and the 3rd in Michigan. Dr. Jacobs in New York is the closes to me, but is still a long trip for me to make. Any donation is helpful and will be greatly appreciated.</font> </p>
<font size=""4""><p><strong><font size=""5"">The Impact</font></strong></p>
</font><font size=""4""></font><p><font size=""4"">I am disabled because of the seizures. My boyfriend works but with the money he makes it is just enough to pay the bills we have now. And no extra left over to try to get me to a doctor that is that far away or as costly as he is or the test that I will need.

</div></div>","Here is my story,
My name is Amy Simmons and I am 29 years old. I was born in Oct of 1982. I am from a small town in West Virginia called Cairo. It all started when i was 3 years old. I had my first grand-mal seizure at that age while i was taking a nap in pre-school. I went 2 years before I had my second one at the age of 5. After that I was seizure free for 8 years until the age of 13. When I had my third seizure and my worse one out of the three. But just as the same with the first two, I didnt have another one for 8 years to come. Until the age of 21 in Feb of 2004. I was told it was 4 in the morning when I let out a loud high pitch screech squeal. And I started having a grand-mal seizure that would change my life forever. Until that time the medicine I had been on had been controlling the seizures. But shortly after having that seizure I started having them on a daily basis. It wasn't and isn't always the grand-mal seizures I have, but all of them are critical in the damage that they do. I have had as many as 10 seizures in one day. The reason I say in the damage that they do is because, when I have them I stop breathing and if standing I lose my balance and fall. Meaning the lack of oxygen causes brain damage, which I have loss most of my memory because of having so many seizures. I can do something yesterday and not remember doing it the next day and sometimes not remember that day. My neurologist told me that he has nothing left that he can do for me, but if I quit having the seizure my memory might get better. But thats not the only damage that it has done I have now broken my nose twice from falling while having seizures. Also I have had to have staples and stitches twice this year. Not to mention the bruising not only on the body as well as on the face. And going out into public and people looking at me and my boyfriend like he beats me. Not knowing what the bruises is from. But is isn't just the physical toll it has on the body, but it has emotional also. Because now I am never by myself someone always has to be with me because they happen and I do not have time to prepare for them. So instead of going to bathroom and having privacy someone has to go with me. I can't go make me something to eat because of them. I am 29 and have to be watched like I am a small child. And then that doesn't always help because even with that I fell and had to get staples and stitches. Just them turning their head for a second it happened.  Me and my boyfriend was in the kitchen cooking he turned his head to get a fork, and I had fallen and split my head.  I had to get 6 staples and 3 stitches.  Then 3 months later we got out car at my parents and he reached in the car to get the dog, and before he stood back up I had a seizure and fell.  I had to get staples again that time for spliting my head on the asphalt.  I want to have a family but with my condition I cannot have kids and be able to watch them. I would injure them if I was holding them and fell with them. So I am at the last resort that I know to do, and that is to ask for help from anyone who reads this. I cannot afford to see the specialist or the testing that needs to be done. Because of the seizures I cannot work cause of the fear of hurting myself or someone else. There is only 3 specialist in the field of doctor that I need to see on the east coast. One is in New York, another in Florida, and the 3rd in Michigan. Dr. Jacobs in New York is the closes to me, but is still a long trip for me to make. Any donation is helpful and will be greatly appreciated. 
The Impact
I am disabled because of the seizures. My boyfriend works but with the money he makes it is just enough to pay the bills we have now. And no extra left over to try to get me to a doctor that is that far away or as costly as he is or the test that I will need. The seizures isn't only effecting my life but others also, because when he is at work my parents has to drive from 30 miles away to stay with me everyday. So they don't get to do the thing that they need to do, and the money it cost them to do this is money they need for things they need. But instead it is going for gas to come and watch me. Whatever money is raised will be used for me to go to see the dr., travel, lodging and testing that needs to be done.
What I Need and What You Get
10,000 dollars is alot of money but considering that it can save my life if he is able to stop the seizures. Because I will not be falling and I will not quit breathing cause I will not be having the seizures. And you will get to know that you help someone live their life and help cure them from an awful disability and hopefully have a family to share the life you saved with.

<p>Once again we are asking for your help, love, and support. With the medical, and traveling expenses for Aroura over these past few months we are once again asking for your help to raise money so we may help pay for our accommodations while at Stanford. We have made arrangements to stay at the Ronald McDonald House at Stanford during Aroura’s initial inpatient care. Unfortunately they cannot guarantee our stay and will not have any space available for about 10 days after our admission date of November 26<sup>th</sup>. This leaves us having to come out of pocket at one of the local hotels that offer discounted rates for families who have children receiving care at the hospital. Even with the discounted rates Palo Alto is still an expensive city and the rooms at the cheapest run about 69 dollars a night plus tax which is more than we can afford for the amount of time we would need to stay there. We are asking for any amount that anyone could spare that would not cause any financial burden. We understand that since it is a holiday season not everyone will be able to help and we understand. Please just continue to keep us in your thoughts and prayers.</p>
<p>Aroura's story:</p>
<p>Our daughter Aroura is a 6 years old girly girl who loves her kitty her little brother and spending time with friends and family. Aroura had just completed the 1st grade at Golden Hills elementary school and just had her first dance recital with Tehachapi Dance Theater in June. Then on July 24th our family received some devastating news… Aroura was diagnosed with AML Leukemia (Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia), and given a 60% chance of cure. AML is a cancer of the bone marrow and the blood that progresses very quickly and has to be treated very aggressively. How could such a healthy and happy little girl be so sick? It has been so unreal for our family especially since AML is so rare among children; there are only about 500 cases a year nationwide of childhood AML. AML affects mostly cells that aren't fully developed and does not allow these cells to carry out their normal functions. Also most people diagnosed with AML have one of eight different kinds (subtypes) of AML. Unfortunately for Aroura she has a subtype that makes her high risk and almost guarantees her to relapse. Her subtype has now dropped her initial 60% chance of cure to a 20 or 30% chance. This means Aroura's best chance for recovery will have to be a bone marrow transplant. Aroura has already completed her first, second and third rounds of chemo therapy. After her first three rounds of chemo we are thankful to say she is in remission and can go to transplant as soon as a donor is found. We have recently met with the team of doctors at Stanford who will be preforming Aroura’s transplant and we have signed all the needed paperwork to move forward with her transplant using a cord blood donor. So now we are enjoying our time at home in between going to and from hospital appointments in Madera and Palo Alto which has just been final preparation to get her ready for transplant. Aroura will be admitted November 26<sup>th</sup> at Stanford to begin receiving Radiation and chemo therapy treatments in preparation for her transplant on December 5th. If all goes well Aroura’s treatment will take approximately 100 days from the date of transplant. So Aroura will stay inpatient at the hospital for 4-6 weeks then when she is well enough she will be released to the Ronald McDonald house at Stanford to stay the remainder of the 100 days while she is recovering and attending daily appointments for care at Stanford. Aroura will still has many obstacles to overcome and the more support the better. Thank you for wanting to know more about Aroura and for choosing to help and support our family. Please feel free to pass her story along. Please keep Aroura and our family in your thoughts and prayers.</p>
