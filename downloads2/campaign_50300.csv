<h2><b><i>WHAT WILL MY CONTRIBUTION PAY FOR?</i></b></h2>
<p><em>This may be the only documentary film done on his life, but it's still an independent feature, which means small budgets will be stretched as far as they will go. We want to produce the best documentary possible to preserve his legacy.</em></p>
<p><em>As far as our funding goal, we are only asking for the bare minimum of what is needed to get this shot and in the can.</em><br/><br/>Pat Morita's family and colleagues that we need to interview live all over the United States. These are production costs and some of the money we raise will help to pay for travel expenses.<br/><br/>We plan on filming this project with 4K resolution cameras, so it's appealing to different distribution platforms, because that's where the technology is headed. Soon all TV stations are going to broadcast in 4K, and we want to be in line with what these distributors are looking for.<br/><br/>A big portion of the budget is for clearing the rights to studio footage that will make the final cut of the documentary film. Pat Morita has appeared in over 200 films and T.V shows combined. We need to pick wisely depending on the story and our budget, what we can afford.<br/><br/>In addition, your contribution will be used to pay for post production editing, sound mixing and music clearances.  This chart will help you understand how the funds raised will be allocated.</p>

<h2><i>WHAT IF YOU RAISE MORE THAN 50K?</i></h2>
<div>50K will definitely jump start our project!  We'll be able to finish shooting the documentary and get us into the post-production phase.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we raise more than 50K <strong>""great""</strong> because then our <i><strong>""STRETCH GOAL""</strong></i> kicks in.  We can begin raising more funds for post, and start dealing with the negotiation process with the big studios regarding the astronomical cost of footage that we need to clear to be able tell his story properly. Pat has been in so many movies and TV shows, and we would like to incorporate those clips into the film, but it is <u><strong>VERY EXPENSIVE</strong></u>. We need to choose wisely and use our <i><strong>""STRETCH GOAL""</strong></i> to achieve this.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><i>Finally, any additional money we raise in our<strong> ""STRETCH GOAL""</strong> would help in promoting the film, so that we can have a limited theater release in LA and NYC to be able to get it qualified for Academy Award consideration.</i></div>

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">What if you don't reach your funding goals?</span></h3>
<p>Our goal is to execute our vision on telling Pat's story! This film will be made regardless, but we don't want to cut corners or compromise the picture in any way. Any funds not raised through IndieGoGo will be raised from private investors and other platforms. Our previous documentary, <i>The Real Miyagi</i> raised 50% of our budget via Indiegogo, and the rest came from a private Canadian investor who found us and helped close the gap. <i><strong>Thank you Pat Nevraumont, Executive Producer of The Real Miyagi!</strong></i>  In short, we don't want to slow down the process and kill the momentum, so that's why meeting our goal on Indiegogo is <u><strong>vital!</strong></u></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""> </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><u><b>When will you start the documentary?</b></u></p>
<p>We have already begun a little bit of shooting. We are estimating about 4 months of filming. Then, we will begin the post-production process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>When will we receive the physical Perks</strong><b>?</b></u></p>
<p>All physical perks such as T-Shirts, Posters and Postcards will be mailed out ASAP, so that you can receive them before <u><strong>THIS</strong></u> holiday next month of December 2016!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>When will we be able to get the digital download and the DVD of the film?</strong></u></p>
<p>Legally, we would be able to provide the downloads once we have secured a distribution deal. Once the deal is made we would send you the link to download the film 10 days before the general public.</p>

<p><u><strong>What happens if I move to a different address? How can I change my delivery address?</strong></u></p>

WHAT WILL MY CONTRIBUTION PAY FOR?
This may be the only documentary film done on his life, but it's still an independent feature, which means small budgets will be stretched as far as they will go. We want to produce the best documentary possible to preserve his legacy.
As far as our funding goal, we are only asking for the bare minimum of what is needed to get this shot and in the can.Pat Morita's family and colleagues that we need to interview live all over the United States. These are production costs and some of the money we raise will help to pay for travel expenses.We plan on filming this project with 4K resolution cameras, so it's appealing to different distribution platforms, because that's where the technology is headed. Soon all TV stations are going to broadcast in 4K, and we want to be in line with what these distributors are looking for.A big portion of the budget is for clearing the rights to studio footage that will make the final cut of the documentary film. Pat Morita has appeared in over 200 films and T.V shows combined. We need to pick wisely depending on the story and our budget, what we can afford.In addition, your contribution will be used to pay for post production editing, sound mixing and music clearances.  This chart will help you understand how the funds raised will be allocated.
 
WHAT IF YOU RAISE MORE THAN 50K?
50K will definitely jump start our project!  We'll be able to finish shooting the documentary and get us into the post-production phase.
 
If we raise more than 50K ""great"" because then our ""STRETCH GOAL"" kicks in.  We can begin raising more funds for post, and start dealing with the negotiation process with the big studios regarding the astronomical cost of footage that we need to clear to be able tell his story properly. Pat has been in so many movies and TV shows, and we would like to incorporate those clips into the film, but it is VERY EXPENSIVE. We need to choose wisely and use our ""STRETCH GOAL"" to achieve this.
 
Finally, any additional money we raise in our ""STRETCH GOAL"" would help in promoting the film, so that we can have a limited theater release in LA and NYC to be able to get it qualified for Academy Award consideration.
 

 

WHERE WILL THE FILM BE RELEASED?
Our goal is to distribute Pat Morita's documentary film on NETFLIX and other VOD platforms like our previous doc, The Real Miyagi.  We had a lot of success and we were able to make it available worldwide for everyone to enjoy.
 
 
We understand that not everyone can contribute, but this film is for everyone. If you are unable to financially back this project, Pat Morita: Long Story Short, then we ask that you please help by sharing the campaign across all of your social media networks.  The more ""Backers"" we have and the more awareness we can build will definitely help us get closer to meeting our goal.  It's SO IMPORTANT to have this support from all of you.  We can't do it alone. Without everyone's effort it would be impossible, so we want to thank you in advance! GO TEAM PAT!
You can find us on Facebook so please SHARE our campaign now.We’ve already received a massive amount of support from some very influential people in the film community, but their voices are not enough. Your support means more than anything to us, and we know that it would have meant the world to Mr. Morita. Please help us celebrate his life!
  
Frequently Asked Questions
 
What if you don't reach your funding goals?
Our goal is to execute our vision on telling Pat's story! This film will be made regardless, but we don't want to cut corners or compromise the picture in any way. Any funds not raised through IndieGoGo will be raised from private investors and other platforms. Our previous documentary, The Real Miyagi raised 50% of our budget via Indiegogo, and the rest came from a private Canadian investor who found us and helped close the gap. Thank you Pat Nevraumont, Executive Producer of The Real Miyagi!  In short, we don't want to slow down the process and kill the momentum, so that's why meeting our goal on Indiegogo is vital!
 
When will you start the documentary?
We have already begun a little bit of shooting. We are estimating about 4 months of filming. Then, we will begin the post-production process.
 
When will we receive the physical Perks?
All physical perks such as T-Shirts, Posters and Postcards will be mailed out ASAP, so that you can receive them before THIS holiday next month of December 2016!
 
When will we be able to get the digital download and the DVD of the film?
Legally, we would be able to provide the downloads once we have secured a distribution deal. Once the deal is made we would send you the link to download the film 10 days before the general public.
 
What happens if I move to a different address? How can I change my delivery address?
About the progress of the shipment, it will be announced in advance. You can then tell us if your address has changed.

<h3>
<span></span>How does it work? </h3>
<p></p>
<p>Adaptom3 SE requires a simple connection with your DJI Phantom3 Flight battery and an external USB device to work with, such as the provided 10W USB light and your smartphone...</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466669252/QQ%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE20160623152614_n2bq9y.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3><b>Why Adaptom3 SE?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4>
<i><span>1. </span></i><b><i>Battery maintenance and storage:</i></b>
</h4>
<p><span>a.</span> Battery should be discharged to a safe level (35%-50%) for a long-term 
storage to ensure the battery safety and extend the battery life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466762220/Battery_nafjkv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> b. “<a href=""#keyfrom=E2Ctranslation"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Passivation</span></a>” presents a problem if a new battery( or stored battery) repeatedly recharged without a periodic full discharge. Hence battery needs some deep charge-discharge cycles to improve its optimal performance before practical application.</p>
<p>Otherwise, battery level may drop during flight and affect the safety of your drone flight. Failure to use or store the battery in a proper safe way could cause serious injury or damage to your drone or other property. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4><i><span>2.</span><b> Traveling with your drone(Battery in airplane)</b></i></h4>
<p></p>
<p>High capacity battery is prohibited to carry on an airline flight unless it is fully discharged ahead of time. </p>
<p>For safety, when you have to travel with your drone, the battery should be first discharged to a level that is allowed to carry or deliver, thus avoiding serious injury and damage (property damage/collateral Damage) caused by battery explosion or fire in the course of transit.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466762323/Airport-1_ukheym.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>You might have been learning “how to” tutorial videos or tips &amp; information about battery maintenance, storage and tricks and have been looking an easy way to correctly store and maintain your flight batteries, that being said, there was no such way that we can access to easily. 
</p>
<p>We gonna fix this with Adaptom3 SE!</p>
<p>TELESIN team had created a safe and fast way for Phantom3 users to store and care their flight battery pretty easily.</p>

</div></div>","Drone Flight Battery: It’s the significant part for the drone to provide you every enjoyable flight. 
It is essential to store and maintain your flight battery correctly and properly to avoid damage or injury. 
That’s why we created the Adaptom3 SE, a smart battery management safety guard for DJI Phantom3 series. 
















Adaptom3 SE is a smart adapter, specially created to help you correctly store and maintain your Phantom 3 series flight batteries. It makes your battery maintenance and storage process easier, faster and safer. 
1. Two modes designed to better suit your individual needs in discharging the battery:
1) Full-discharging function: the battery can be fully discharged by using this function.
                                       

◊ Fully discharges your flight battery before carrying it on an airline flight.
◊ Fully discharges your battery to proceed with some deep charge-discharge cycles, so as to increase the optimal performance of your new battery or stored battery which has a “passivation” problem. 

2) Conditioned auto-discharging function: the battery will automatically discharge to its nominal voltage.

◊ Discharges the flight battery to its nominal voltage(15.2V) prior to storing or transporting it.
2. Extensive Function:



Adaptom3 SE changes your battery into a power bank to charge USB devices!
With Adaptom3 SE, the power can be reused when the battery needs  to be discharged, even the Remaining Juice of the battery can be used to full charge an 
iPhone 6S though the battery does not support a flight anymore.







1. Compact Design


Adaptom3 SE consists of a simply designed housing and a discharging management PCBA board.







2. Plug & Play 


How does it work? 

Adaptom3 SE requires a simple connection with your DJI Phantom3 Flight battery and an external USB device to work with, such as the provided 10W USB light and your smartphone...






Why Adaptom3 SE?



1. Battery maintenance and storage:

a. Battery should be discharged to a safe level (35%-50%) for a long-term 
storage to ensure the battery safety and extend the battery life.


 b. “Passivation” presents a problem if a new battery( or stored battery) repeatedly recharged without a periodic full discharge. Hence battery needs some deep charge-discharge cycles to improve its optimal performance before practical application.
Otherwise, battery level may drop during flight and affect the safety of your drone flight. Failure to use or store the battery in a proper safe way could cause serious injury or damage to your drone or other property. 

2. Traveling with your drone(Battery in airplane)

High capacity battery is prohibited to carry on an airline flight unless it is fully discharged ahead of time. 
For safety, when you have to travel with your drone, the battery should be first discharged to a level that is allowed to carry or deliver, thus avoiding serious injury and damage (property damage/collateral Damage) caused by battery explosion or fire in the course of transit.



You might have been learning “how to” tutorial videos or tips & information about battery maintenance, storage and tricks and have been looking an easy way to correctly store and maintain your flight batteries, that being said, there was no such way that we can access to easily. 

We gonna fix this with Adaptom3 SE!
TELESIN team had created a safe and fast way for Phantom3 users to store and care their flight battery pretty easily.
With plug and play feature and standard USB compatibility, Adaptom3 SE enables users to discharge batteries with any USB devices, and it only takes few hours for the whole process.  In short, Adaptom3 SE is specially designed for every Phantom3 users at affordable price!

Adaptom3 SE is an innovative departure from the current battery discharging board in the market. Tiny, but powerful and versatile.
It is not just designed to bring your battery life up but also power up your life with the extensive charging function! This allows you to reuse the ""discharged power"" optionally, so that you can save power as possible as you can.
BE SMART & BE GREEN
             -Discharge your battery and charge your devices simultaneously.

<p><b>Let's give life back to the families of people with serious diseases</b></p>
<p>While India is famous
for many things, a not so known fact is about the rising number of terminal diseases
including cancer, kidney and heart diseases in many Indian cities. Doctors consider
this is due to poor living conditions and lack of awareness of proper food
habits among many people. </p>
<p><span>Among the Indian states, the small South Indian
state of Kerala tells a scary story of sufferings and deprivation due to
terminal illnesses. </span></p>
<p><span>For example a 2015 data indicates that one in 135
people in the Kottayam region in the state of Kerala in India falls victim of
cancer each year. Overall, there are around 35,000 new cancer patients each
year in the state of Kerala alone, and over 100,000 prevalent cases annually
with most of them under extreme financial stress and struggling to treat their
disease. </span></p>
<p>Government resources
and support system to help such people are inadequate. Many government
hospitals have inadequate facilities and support systems for poor
patients. </p>
<p>Many people who manage
to secure treatment in heavily populated government hospitals often sleep rough
on footpaths and bus station benches while visiting distant towns where these
hospitals are located. </p>
<p><span>Many households of people with terminal illness in
several regions in Kerala especially small business owners and farmers live
under the threat of losing their livelihood as well as their loved ones due to

<p><b>About the K.S Raju Foundation </b></p>
<p>K.S Raju Foundation was established
to help such people with terminal illnesses and their families. </p>
<p>K S Raju a veteran
businessman from the small town of Pala in the state of Kerala in India
surrendered to cancer on 4 March 2016. He was a generous human being who helped
many around him. He was very particular to ensure the left hand didn’t know the
right hand’s givings. His survivors came to know about his generocity to many
only after his demise.</p>
<p>In Raju’s case there
was only a 10 weeks period between diagnosis of this dreadful disease and his demise.
But in this short journey Raju and his family encountered the hard realities of
financial stress and uncertainties in the lives of the dependent employees of his
business. </p>
<p>They also witnessed
the plight of many unfortunate fellow human beings fighting with similar
conditions.  </p>
<p>That said, Raju was
fortunate to have two sons whom he educated well to be independent of his small
business - one an executive within the Australian Government and the other an
IT Professional in Australia. </p>
<p>They supported their
father for his treatment and funded the business to address some challenges it
had to face in the absence of its guiding spirit. </p>
<p>But the whole
experience of the survivors of Raju in their hard times provided them a clear
understanding of the gruesome fate of many others in the region facing similar
conditions, with no such help that Raju and his employees received. </p>
<p><b>What would the KS Raju Foundation do to
address the problem? </b></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Foundation aims to
ease the financial burden on people with serious illness by providing for their
treatment thereby protecting them from falling victims of debt trap and
homelessness.</span></p><p>Where the seriously ill person is the soul earner of a family, the Foundation will support the family by supporting the survivors to earn a living and provide interim support to meet living cost and children's education.</p>
<p>The foundation will partner
with like-minded charity organisations in the region to develop free decent
accommodation around government hospitals for poor patients from distant places
visiting these hospital for treatment.  </p>
<p>The organisation will
also engage social workers to provide emotional support for patients and their
families and help them comeback to life without losing their homes and
livelihood. On-the ground presence of volunteer social workers at the
Government Hospitals would ensure the most eligible people are identified and assisted
financially with the resources available to the Foundation.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Funding Plan </b></p>
<p>Full ongoing profits
from Raju's surviving business after a small employee ownership share has been
committed to this project. This would support a small number of people (2-3
people)</p>
<p>Your help today will
help many more to face the challenges posed by serious illness and help them
comeback to life. </p>
<p>Returns from a highly
secure endowment fund and other securely managed assets of $2.5 million will
support around 90 people and their families each year. This means your one-off
support today will help over 300 people including family members of seriously
ill people each year. (An example of returns from the fund:  interest offered by private and public sector
banks in India for fixed deposit and bonds is around 10%. Interest on a $2.5
million fund would be sufficient for basic support for around 90 families each
year, which would help around 400  people out of poverty each year. </p><p>From our experience, we understand that assistance over a period of 12-18 months would enable a family to overcome their financial stress due to treatment cost and other uncertainties (each family's circumstances varies, but generally support over this period would help come back to life in most cases). This means the target funding would help more than 1000 people over the next four years. </p>
<p>The Foundation will ensure that the
entire funds reach target recipients. </p>
<p><b>Concluding Plea</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Foundation kindly
request your soul hearted support for this project. Your generosity today means
life for many for many years to come. </p>
<p>We kindly request you

Afrikin Fest is an African inspired festival
aimed to attract the best chefs, rum and wine connoisseurs, musical and fine artists, thought leaders and innovators from around the world to the infamous cultural hub of Miami, Florida. 
Miami will be completely transformed through fascinating sights, smells, and sounds during this weekend celebration from November 18-20, 2016.
The event proceeds will benefit Give Me Dignity, an organization that raises awareness about and provides resources for survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse (CSA).  
   
What We Need & What You Get  We are raising $125,000 for festival costs which include, but are not limited to: production, promotion, talent, venue, and other related expenses. The funds will also foster development of an app to enhance the festival experience. The app will enable event patrons to view a map of the festival grounds, food villages, the list of performers and set times, the ability to add favorites, and create a personalized schedule that can be shared via social media.
We appreciate and will accept any donation amount you can offer, and we are happy to provide event perks for donors who make contributions starting at $225.



The Impact 


Afrikin Fest goes beyond music and art to highlight the ingenuity, economic, and social opportunity of one of the world’s fastest-growing regions - Africa. 

TALKS
Talks and workshops will be presented by influencers in technology, education, international relations, activism and business, in an effort to connect you to industry leaders that represent the diaspora.


CUISINE
We’re creating a culinary experience that will rival any food festival and wine tasting. We’re curating the finest in African cuisines, topping off the experience with cooking demonstrations by celebrity chefs.


INNOVATION
Innovation is key, and this will be evident by the companies and products that will be present at our exhibitions and as vendors throughout Afrikin Fest weekend. We’re talking trailblazers, up-and-comers of the diaspora who have identified gaps in the market, developed solutions, have a presence in the marketplace and are ready to present their ideas to investors to take them to the next level.

MUSIC & ART
A musical and artistic experience will still be had, with world-class performers and art installations that will remind us of our history and encourage us to take hold of our future.

 The event will
simultaneously highlight the importance of the Black Dollar,
which continues to rise as the percentage of people of color within the middle
class increases.
ULTIMATELY...
The event proceeds will benefit Give Me Dignity, an organization with a resounding voice against childhood sexual abuse (CSA). 60% of Black girls experience sexual abuse before the age of 18, and 30% of Black women with documented histories of childhood sexual abuse are sexually assaulted in adulthood (Sexual Abuse and the Code of Silence in the Black Community, Cherise Charleswell, 2014).  We recognize our responsibility to better the lives of others and the communities we serve, and this event will inspire others to do the same.

<p>DO BIG THINGS, </p>
<h2><strong>Are you living or are you just surviving? </strong></h2>
<p>Maybe you're like the 70% of Americans who hate getting up every single day and going into a job they despise? Maybe you feel you're not living with purpose and passion? Perhaps you have a great idea for a business, but want to play it safe so you're not acting on it? Or maybe you have tried or have see others try and fail, so you're scared of taking action? </p>
<p>My fellow visionaries, I was there too! Monday mornings were the worst day of the week. Every Sunday evening I went to bed knowing that the next day I had to get up and help someone else fulfill their dreams while mine stayed hidden in the background. I was scared of failure and had the same concerns you do about money and taking care of my family. </p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My good friend Travis felt the same way, but just like him we knew if we did nothing we both would continue to be miserable and never fulfill our lives purpose. We both knew if we did not try, it would be worse than staying and just surviving. We had our own legacy we wanted to leave and desired to have a positive impact on the world around us.  That's when we both started living. We took actions and started doing BIG THINGS. </p>

<p>Les Brown has famously said it best<i>. ""The graveyard is the richest place on earth, because it is here that you will find all the hopes and dreams that were never fulfilled, the books that were never written, the songs that were never sung, the inventions that were never shared, the cures that were never discovered, all because someone was too afraid to take that first step, keep with the problem, or determined to carry out their dream.""</i></p>
<p>Do you want to take your vision to the grave with you? I don't believe so...Neither did Travis or I. Though life is not perfect, and this entrepreneurial action-taking journey has not been easy, it's definitely been worth it. Travis and I are right in the middle of our endeavors and have both experienced difficulties as well as rewards. But the important thing is, we are in the game!</p>

<h3>We all need a little help</h3>
<p>Knowing how difficult this journey can be, when we connected we wanted to create a way to help others like you overcome your challenges and take action. Both of us were passionate about creating  an event to offer the inspiration, education and community support to take action and DO BIG THINGS.  </p>
<p>Our goal is to make it a unique conference by having a mastermind collaborative aspect built in. Attendees would have the opportunity to have a plan in place before they leave after the two-day event. Our 12 amazing speakers have taken action and can offer specific plans on how you can start doing your own BIG THINGS. </p>
<p>As you may know, this is not an easy task, but we are not going to let a little difficulty hold us back. We know as we come together as a community, we can make this happen in November. </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We have found a really cool location in the heart of West Palm Beach called the EMKO. It's not a stuffy hotel conference room, but rather a unique creative environment. It's close to downtown, the airport, and of course the beach. We purposely want to keep the event small this year and will only be offering 120 tickets MAX live at the event!</p>

<h2><b>'Haven' - Monsters or Tax Dodgers?</b></h2>
<h2 align=""center"">We want to investigate...<br/>
</h2>
<p>The cornerstone of any decent investigatory drama is when you peel away at the unknown.  We know <i>some</i> facts about Haven, but not much.  Traditional internet searches return 
practically nothing on the subject, and we feel that is an unprecedentedly advantageous
 potential starting point for a documentary.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460996505/Haven_-_Monks_dzspod.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Here is the limited information we have painstakingly gathered so far... <br/>
<ul>
<li>Haven is an island approximately twenty-three miles from the United Kingdom mainland.</li>
<li>Coordinates: 49°29'41.2""N+5°22'28.8""W<br/>
</li>
<li>The island's population is thought to be circa 110.</li>
<li>Reports suggest that the median age of the locals is 75; 
consequently, we can reasonably derive that the majority of its inhabitants are at 
least of pensionable age, if not fast approaching it.</li>
<li>The ONS (Office for National Statistics) does not have Haven 
registered, and so actual raw census data is unavailable.  We have tried 
contacting Haven via the usual authority channels, but they have yet to reply.  This could change, 
however, as our endeavors continue.</li>
<li>Forensic online 
research tools we have employed have failed to return anything of value 
to aid our fact-gathering, although we have found some semi-reliable 
history on Haven dating back to the late 15th century <i>(and which is 
exclusively available to you if you are able to contribute financially -
 see perks that contain ""The History of Haven"" digital download).</i><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Filmmakers<br/>
</h3>We are Drew Cullingham and Andrew Mackay - two British, independent filmmakers.  Our background is in film, and we believe we are<i> </i>the best fit for creating this important work.<br/><br/><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459462561/365_xt9nce.png"" src="""" style=""""/><i>Andrew Mackay (left) &amp; Drew Cullingham</i><br/></p>Haven will be a feature documentary where we serve as both the full crew <i>and</i> stars of the show, which has helped us remain economical in two ways:<br/><br/><p>1: We need not expend any budget on crew, as <i>we are the crew</i>.<br/></p>
<p>2: We have a wealth of experience behind us, collaboratively and independently.</p>
<h3><b>Andrew Mackay</b></h3>
<p><i>Interviewer / sound</i></p>
<p>An author, playwright and filmmaker, Andrew has made two feature documentaries, one feature film (The Scared of Death Society) and dozens of shorts.  He is most widely known for writing, editing and directing 'The Making of Mutant Chronicles', which can be found on DVD and BluRay of 'Mutant Chronicles', starring John Malkovich, Thomas Jane and Ron Perlman.  He also played a monk in the film which is somewhat ironic, given the nature of Haven's history!  The documentary attracted rave notices and has been widely regarded as among the best of its type.</p>
<p>Please visit Andrew's IMDB page <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0533125/?ref_=fn_nm_nm_2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here </a>for more information.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Drew Cullingham</b></h3>
<p><i>Camera / editor</i><br/></p>
<p>Writer, director and editor Drew Cullingham has worked on various features, including 'Umbrage: The First Vampire' (aka 'A Vampire's Tale'), starring Doug Bradley and distributed by Lionsgate, 'Monk3ys', which won best micro-budget film at Raindance and best film at The Yellow Fever Independent Film Festival, and 'Black Smoke Rising'.</p>

<p>We first collaborated on the feature-length horror movie, 'The Devil's Bargain' (2014), and have co-written two screenplays together.<br/></p>
<p>Haven is a project we are extremely passionate about. In order to get there and convince (and hopefully not coerce!) the locals to contribute, we need to - literally - get there.  This is where you come in...</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459463600/Haven_-_The_Ruin_swnov0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>Simply put, for this feature-length film we need £9,275.00. Actually, we need £9,274.55 - but we've taken the liberty of rounding up. We have costed this project right down to the last fraction of a penny.  A significant portion of the budget enables us to actually travel to the island and stay for approximately two weeks.  If we cannot do this, then there simply is no film - and so we sincerely appreciate any financial generosity you are able to contribute to our campaign.<br/></p>
<p align=""center""><i><b>Here's how our budget breaks down</b></i></p>
<p><i><b></b></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460490343/Pie_Chart_qsamyv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><i><b>All figures in GBP</b></i><br/><i>Subsistence - 900.00</i><i><br/>Travel - 1,000.00</i><i><br/>Accommodation - 750.00</i><i><br/>Equipment Rental - 2,500.00</i><i><br/>Visual Effects (VFX) &amp; Grading - 500.00</i><i><br/>Sound Design &amp; Mix - 1,000.00</i><i><br/>Marketing &amp; Social Media - 1,000.00</i><i><br/>Publicity &amp; Hire - 800.00<br/>""Honoring"" Perks - 200.00<br/>Design (incl. screener production) - 625.00</i></p>
<p>TOTAL: 9,275.00<br/></p>
<i>*We have our own editing facilities, and so do not require funding for this element.</i><br/><p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why put yourselves at risk to make this documentary feature?<br/>
</h3>There's simply no doubt about it in our minds - due to the blatant absence of information on the island (and resultant social ignominy) Haven <i>is certainly documentary material</i> precisely because it is unknown!  Even we as filmmakers are unsure of what we will find when we eventually make our way into their territory.
<p>In summary:<br/></p>
<ul> <li>We are making 'Haven' because we feel that there must be a reason why the island is shrouded in mystery and lacks any fundamental information.  Its mystery is unbound and undiscovered, and we sincerely believe that we are the most suited film making duo to do the film justice.</li>
<li>We believe our fantastic perks on the right-hand panel are unique and attractive for those wishing to become a part of truly innovative film making.  <b>This campaign features in the film frequently, as we are making no bones about how we got financed: in fact, quite the contrary - we are embracing it!</b>  This is good news for anyone that contributes, as they will also share in the rewards. This is a true (some may say ""meta"") injection of reality into the project. We are operating as economically viable as we possibly can.  We only really need to cover our expenses, subsistence and non-negotiable elements such as equipment rental, travel, accommodation and modest publicity capital, in order to fully realize the project's potential and do it justice.<br/>
</li>
<li>Should we fall short of our goal we will still make the film, anyway.  We will have to make financially comparable readjustments to allow for us to make it, though.  We really need to hit our target in order to produce a film of quality, and which meets consumer's expectations.  And because, quite frankly, <i>you are the customer</i> - you already possess a salient understanding of the need for quality on a micro budget feature film - and this can only occur if we reach our modest target.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459463924/Haven_-_Elderly_Couple_z0uptp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>The Risks</h3>
<p>Of course, we will acknowledge that our primary perceived ""risk"" is that we visit Haven, find nothing and return home with little to excite anyone.  This is why we are approaching the film as an investigative piece.  We are quite sure we'll find <i>something</i>, whether it be a heartwarming local community living on the fringes of society or something resembling a modest ""pre-funeral home"" whose inhabitants are marching inexorably toward the inevitable.</p>
<p>At the very least we will have explored and put to rest any misconceptions that Haven may have earned itself.  Our film will have (one way or another) put Haven on the map and ends its unnecessary quantity as 'unknown' once and for all<br/></p>
<p>Contrarily, of course, it may be that Haven is harboring something far, far more sinister than we could have possibly imagined.  But only Drew thinks that, and he's quite obviously wrong.<br/></p>
<p>The biggest risk, of course, is that we do not make the film and some 
other, less experienced chancers beat us to it because they managed to

""Haven""- a feature documentary filmby Drew Cullingham & Andrew Mackay
 
Now that you've watched the opening video, we are very excited that you are considering helping us raise the funds necessary for this project.  Before you read any further, we need you to know that we plan to use this campaign in the actual movie and make frequent references to it, as the campaign will have essentially ""IndieGoGo'd"" our project into existence.


'Haven' - Monsters or Tax Dodgers?
We want to investigate...

The cornerstone of any decent investigatory drama is when you peel away at the unknown.  We know some facts about Haven, but not much.  Traditional internet searches return 
practically nothing on the subject, and we feel that is an unprecedentedly advantageous
 potential starting point for a documentary.

Here is the limited information we have painstakingly gathered so far... 

Haven is an island approximately twenty-three miles from the United Kingdom mainland.
Coordinates: 49°29'41.2""N+5°22'28.8""W

The island's population is thought to be circa 110.
Reports suggest that the median age of the locals is 75; 
consequently, we can reasonably derive that the majority of its inhabitants are at 
least of pensionable age, if not fast approaching it.
The ONS (Office for National Statistics) does not have Haven 
registered, and so actual raw census data is unavailable.  We have tried 
contacting Haven via the usual authority channels, but they have yet to reply.  This could change, 
however, as our endeavors continue.
Forensic online 
research tools we have employed have failed to return anything of value 
to aid our fact-gathering, although we have found some semi-reliable 
history on Haven dating back to the late 15th century (and which is 
exclusively available to you if you are able to contribute financially -
 see perks that contain ""The History of Haven"" digital download).



The Filmmakers
We are Drew Cullingham and Andrew Mackay - two British, independent filmmakers.  Our background is in film, and we believe we are the best fit for creating this important work.Andrew Mackay (left) & Drew CullinghamHaven will be a feature documentary where we serve as both the full crew and stars of the show, which has helped us remain economical in two ways:1: We need not expend any budget on crew, as we are the crew.
2: We have a wealth of experience behind us, collaboratively and independently.
Andrew Mackay
Interviewer / sound
An author, playwright and filmmaker, Andrew has made two feature documentaries, one feature film (The Scared of Death Society) and dozens of shorts.  He is most widely known for writing, editing and directing 'The Making of Mutant Chronicles', which can be found on DVD and BluRay of 'Mutant Chronicles', starring John Malkovich, Thomas Jane and Ron Perlman.  He also played a monk in the film which is somewhat ironic, given the nature of Haven's history!  The documentary attracted rave notices and has been widely regarded as among the best of its type.
Please visit Andrew's IMDB page here for more information.

Drew Cullingham
Camera / editor
Writer, director and editor Drew Cullingham has worked on various features, including 'Umbrage: The First Vampire' (aka 'A Vampire's Tale'), starring Doug Bradley and distributed by Lionsgate, 'Monk3ys', which won best micro-budget film at Raindance and best film at The Yellow Fever Independent Film Festival, and 'Black Smoke Rising'.
Please visit Drew's IMDb page here for more information.
We first collaborated on the feature-length horror movie, 'The Devil's Bargain' (2014), and have co-written two screenplays together.
Haven is a project we are extremely passionate about. In order to get there and convince (and hopefully not coerce!) the locals to contribute, we need to - literally - get there.  This is where you come in...


What We Need & What You Get 

Simply put, for this feature-length film we need £9,275.00. Actually, we need £9,274.55 - but we've taken the liberty of rounding up. We have costed this project right down to the last fraction of a penny.  A significant portion of the budget enables us to actually travel to the island and stay for approximately two weeks.  If we cannot do this, then there simply is no film - and so we sincerely appreciate any financial generosity you are able to contribute to our campaign.
Here's how our budget breaks down


All figures in GBPSubsistence - 900.00Travel - 1,000.00Accommodation - 750.00Equipment Rental - 2,500.00Visual Effects (VFX) & Grading - 500.00Sound Design & Mix - 1,000.00Marketing & Social Media - 1,000.00Publicity & Hire - 800.00""Honoring"" Perks - 200.00Design (incl. screener production) - 625.00
TOTAL: 9,275.00
*We have our own editing facilities, and so do not require funding for this element.
Why put yourselves at risk to make this documentary feature?
There's simply no doubt about it in our minds - due to the blatant absence of information on the island (and resultant social ignominy) Haven is certainly documentary material precisely because it is unknown!  Even we as filmmakers are unsure of what we will find when we eventually make our way into their territory.
In summary:
 We are making 'Haven' because we feel that there must be a reason why the island is shrouded in mystery and lacks any fundamental information.  Its mystery is unbound and undiscovered, and we sincerely believe that we are the most suited film making duo to do the film justice.
We believe our fantastic perks on the right-hand panel are unique and attractive for those wishing to become a part of truly innovative film making.  This campaign features in the film frequently, as we are making no bones about how we got financed: in fact, quite the contrary - we are embracing it!  This is good news for anyone that contributes, as they will also share in the rewards. This is a true (some may say ""meta"") injection of reality into the project. We are operating as economically viable as we possibly can.  We only really need to cover our expenses, subsistence and non-negotiable elements such as equipment rental, travel, accommodation and modest publicity capital, in order to fully realize the project's potential and do it justice.

Should we fall short of our goal we will still make the film, anyway.  We will have to make financially comparable readjustments to allow for us to make it, though.  We really need to hit our target in order to produce a film of quality, and which meets consumer's expectations.  And because, quite frankly, you are the customer - you already possess a salient understanding of the need for quality on a micro budget feature film - and this can only occur if we reach our modest target.


The Risks
Of course, we will acknowledge that our primary perceived ""risk"" is that we visit Haven, find nothing and return home with little to excite anyone.  This is why we are approaching the film as an investigative piece.  We are quite sure we'll find something, whether it be a heartwarming local community living on the fringes of society or something resembling a modest ""pre-funeral home"" whose inhabitants are marching inexorably toward the inevitable.
At the very least we will have explored and put to rest any misconceptions that Haven may have earned itself.  Our film will have (one way or another) put Haven on the map and ends its unnecessary quantity as 'unknown' once and for all
Contrarily, of course, it may be that Haven is harboring something far, far more sinister than we could have possibly imagined.  But only Drew thinks that, and he's quite obviously wrong.
The biggest risk, of course, is that we do not make the film and some 
other, less experienced chancers beat us to it because they managed to 
secure funding... we cannot let that happen.
    We're excited as to what we'll find there...
We are aiming to produce a documentary not unlike the very best of Michael Moore (Bowling for Columbine) or Nick Broomfield's (Kurt and Courtney) output.By far the biggest Unique Selling Point of Haven is the fact that we are going in 'raw' and making frequent references to how we got funded (i.e. this page, and you, dear contributor) and using it as a through-line for the narrative.  We're not aware of any other online crowdfunding campaigns who have done the same thing for a film they plan to make, so this is very exciting!  Incidentally, if you know someone who currently resides on Haven - or someone who may have even the most tenuous of connections - please email us directly at haventhefilm@gmail.com

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>My name is Byron Kirk, I
am a 29 year old former soldier, veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan war, and
university educated photographer.</p>
<p>At the age of 17, I was working
as a horse guard in Central London. It was 2004, only months after the invasion
of Iraq. My regiment was split into two; a ceremonial side, based in
Knightsbridge and an armoured side based in Windsor.</p>
<p>The way it often worked,
is that soldiers spent 2 years on ceremonial duty, followed by 2 years
armoured. This pattern would then be repeated throughout a soldier’s career. </p>
<p>Whilst the armoured side
sounds like the more stressful of the two, it certainly wasn’t. </p>
<p>People forgot about you
in Knightsbridge, the hours were long and hard, and required more bullshit then
brains. Soldiers from other regiments, friends who were on active tours across
the world, would joke, ""what do you even do there"" or ""aren’t
you wasting taxpayers money?"" </p>
<p>We were at the beginning
stages of what we all know now to be a fierce 6-year conflict in Iraq. For many
young people, who had joined the army only to serve in a war, it was difficult.
What is the point of being here I would regularly ask myself, I just want to
fight.</p>
<p>I was down the stables
one day and my SGT, who I didn’t know to well, was shouting at a horse. He said
something along the lines of ""I wish I with the lads in Iraq"" before
storming off on a premature tea break.</p>
<p>I didn’t think much of
his outburst, especially considering the fact that I didn’t even know him to
well. All I knew was that he was upset, and its best for the new lad (i.e. me)
to stay clear.</p>
<p>Later that night -
around 3am - that same SGT, under the influence of alcohol, walked back down
into the stables and hung himself with a ceremonial bright chain. He was found
by the night guard, hanging in his office.</p>
<p>The following day, the
Sun newspaper, reported that he had taken his life due to the accumulation of
parking tickets. I don’t know whether that’s true or not, but for years after,
those words ""I wish I was the lads in Iraq"" echoed in my thoughts.</p>
<p>His death does not fit
into the media's assumption that veterans will only kill them selves as a
direct result of traumatic experience in war... In fact, if his statement
""I wish I was with the lads in Iraq"" had any bearing on his suicide,
it would imply, that some veterans will feel saddened, or deeply lost, by an
indication that they may not serve in a frontline role, and may even take their
own life as a result.</p>
<p>And that’s how I became
interested, in the concept of suicidal masculinity.</p>
<p><b>Suicidal Masculinity</b></p>
<p>Its not as complex as it
sounds, young men aspire to be heroes but often the hero dies; his youthfulness
remains, and only the good is preserved. To die in war, is to be canonised as a
civil saint, a man or a woman, pure and immortal.</p>
<p>Now, most of you may
already understand, that the act of martyrdom, is a common theme in Palestine,
and that children, of all ages are encouraged by multiple outlets to die
""heroes"" by taking their own lives.</p>
<p>But this phenomenon
exists in our own culture, in-fact you could say we are pretty good at it. We
encourage it in myths, legends, nursery rhymes and even popular culture.</p>
<p>Its a common cliché, what
that we all recognise, that at some point in the film, the hero will die.</p>
<p>But what happens when
the hero doesn’t die? Well they come home, they age, they lose functionality
and eventually, when all is forgotten, they die, perhaps lonely and afraid, a shadow
of their former, apparent selves.</p>
<p>A friend of mine once
told me, that he was worried about this process and that he could cheat it all
by taking his own life now. If he could find the bollocks to kill himself, then
perhaps he would be remembered, as a casualty of war; a hero in most peoples
eyes.</p>
<p>Its important that we
talk about that. I don’t doubt that people, including veterans think
differently. Some returning from war may feel displaced or lost by trauma,
isolation or in an inability to transition. But what we cannot do is ignore
those, who like my friend above, feel as though they is glory in death, when
they is nothing else in life to achieve.</p>

If there is any money left over after all of that, although doubtful, then it will be put into buying some graphics or animation for the film.

We need at least 3 of us to fly to both countries, we need money to travel to the various areas where the geoglyphs are found, to stay in hotels so that we can charge batteries etc. We feel flying over the glyphs is essential and we would really like to get some expert opinions on the glyphs, which will be much easier if we can offer some sort of payment. If there is any money left over after all of that, although doubtful, then it will be put into buying some graphics or animation for the film. If we don’t reach our entire goal then we will still make the film but will have to miss some of the above, either the experts, the flights, the post-production goodies or all of them.
Any donator is welcome to a pdf copy of Mick’s e-book and anybody who donates over £150 will be put in the credits as a co-producer.
If you are struggling for spare cash at the moment then there are other ways you can help. Please share this on any social media outlets that you use as maybe your friends or family would be interested and able to help. We at Modern Explorers also encourage people to get involved with any of our filming projects (there are ideas of how you can help on our website), we always need help with research; maybe you know of other giant geoglyphs around the world, if you do please contact us.
Thank You for reading and please help us if you can.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1><b>PUBLIC RELEASE</b></h1>
<h1><b>Breath-Taking Documentary About Amazon Rainforest Needs Support On INDIEGOGO</b></h1>
<h3>
<b>The Inside Of Us</b> is a unique documentary by a heroic filmmaking team from The Czech Republic, and it needs funding on INDIEGOGO. Told through the feelings of the Amazon Rainforest’s indigenous people, the film starkly shows the destruction of the people’s culture, homes, and their source of precious medicines. <b>The Inside Of Us</b> stresses the importance of the Amazon Rainforest, and its social value to Western society. Rather than outrage, <b>The Inside Of Us</b> aims to guide viewers toward awareness and action to protect the Amazon Rainforest and its people. </h3>

<h4>To keep <b>The Inside Of Us</b> independent, the filmmakers ask for public help on INDIEGOGO.  They have personally invested nearly $100,000 while refusing lucrative contract offers. A free preview of the first 10 minutes of <b>The Inside Of Us </b>is available to journalists and potential donors.</h4>
<p><b>The Inside Of Us</b> features three <b>renowned scientists:</b> theoretical physicist <b>Amit Goswami,</b> anthropologist <b>Jeremy Narby</b> and psychiatrist <b>Stanislav Grof.</b> Producer Oldrich Tamas is <b>the winner of the International JURI Prize</b> from a prestigious Czech film festival.  Tamas’ artistic collaborator, Jan Rajnoha, directs the film. <b>The Inside Of Us</b> was <b>shot in 5 countries on 3 continents.</b> Filming began in <b>2013</b> in the <b>Amazon Rainforest</b> of Peru and Ecuador in South America, in North America in <b>New York,</b> and in <b>Europe’s Switzerland</b> and The Czech Republic. Using <b>cutting-edge technology,</b> <b>The Inside of Us </b>is top-quality viewing.</p>

<p>The filmmakers choose to <b>remain independent,</b> refusing to accept any private-sector funds that would interfere with the artistic control of <b>The Inside Of Us</b>. Ambitious international plans are underway for <b>The Inside Of Us</b>. The film will be distributed to some <b>300 TV stations worldwide.</b> Screenings will be held at major international festivals.

Summary of the first movie
It is a documentary on life in the Amazon rainforest and about the wisdom and values professed by its indigenous inhabitants, in contrast with our so-called Western civilization.  



Importance of the rainforest
The film seeks to introduce the beauty of the world's largest rainforest but also touches upon the mysteries of the messages that are still to be found while revealing the dire threats to this precious place, which is important for the entire planet.






Journey of discovery

Zerock Oner, as the mysterious protagonist, embarks on a journey of discovery. Seeking escape from life in Western society that he finds so frustrating, he tries to find answers to some fundamental questions in our lives. Why, when mankind is so technologically advanced, is our planet still in such an alarming state? How can we change this situation? 



The power of natural healing

In the footsteps of the wisdom of the indigenous tribes, the power of natural healing, and mystical shamanism, we set out to explore the borders of altered states of consciousness known in our everyday reality. 


With the help of the mysterious lianas of death, we are immediately confronted face to face with ourselves. Perhaps there are answers to our questions. 




Featuring international stars

The film features the Czech-born American psychiatrist, Dr. Stanislav Grof, Ph.D., Swiss anthropologist and author of The Cosmic Serpent, Dr. Jeremy Narby, and quantum theorist Dr. Amit Goswami, Ph.D. 

Synopsis of the first movie

The film The Inside Of Us tells its story in two arcs. On the one hand, the commentary presents specific information about the environment while, on the other, the film also follows the personal story of Zerock Oner, our main character. Zerock is portrayed in an unusual way and is shown in the film more as a shadow, silhouette, or a voice, and through him we explore a new way to see reality.



The bustle of city life

The story of Zerock begins amid the chaos, stress, and hustle and bustle of city life. Zerock feels dissatisfied with his life and the environment, grasping to find answers to the fundamental questions of our lives. But his search is fruitless, and so he resolves to venture out into the unknown - on an adventure to seek the wisdom of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon.  

Current issues facing the rainforest
During his travels, he witnesses the current issues facing the rainforest and learns more about the traditional way of life of its indigenous people who are treated unjustly by the authorities. The film explores the symbiosis of the indigenous people living in harmony with nature and their ancient healer, a life which is closely linked to the use of highly psychoactive substances.




Controversial issues


These controversial issues in the film are explored with the help of many researchers involved in scientific studies. Dr. Jeremy Narby is a world-renowned anthropologist who has studied these indigenous cultures in their own environment for many years. Dr. Stanislav Grof, a psychiatrist specializing in the study of expanded states of consciousness, and quantum theorist Amit Goswami, who tells us about how all living beings and inanimate matter are interconnected. The film highlights the contrast between a natural way of life and life in Western society. 


Through the film, we learn about


The issue of the Amazon as a whole, about native Amazonian traditions and healing, about Swiss scientists who conduct research in the Amazon rainforest, seeking medicinal plants. We will get to meet the heads of communities, where native Amazonian law and oppression are discussed. We get the chance to observe ourselves through a sacred medicine called Ayahuasca in a Peruvian treatment center. We get to visit well-known as well as yet unexplored places in these many beautiful locations.  



A visual treat

The film is made for a wide range of audiences. We are planning to accompany the audio and visual scenery with interviews from scientists, academics, and theorists; however, these will only be general, with no deeper analysis that could affect anyone's freedom of choice or philosophy. It is all made for a discerning audience looking for a visual treat.

Concept of THE INSIDE OF US
The Inside Of Us is a series of six documentary films from different parts of the world. The entire project is subtitled ""The possibility of another view of our collective perception of the reality of life."" Through these films, we explore places where people live in symbiosis with nature while highlighting the contrast with life in technologically advanced countries.



Addressing current issues
In each episode, we address a different current issue of global importance with the aim of drawing attention to that issue from a different perspective. We want to enable audiences to form their own opinions of these issues after watching the film. At the same time, our desire is to encourage a sense of belonging with nature and everything around us. 


Looking for answers

In the starring role, Zerock Oner sets out on a journey of discovery, seeking answers to his questions. The project is subtitled ""The possibility of another view of our collective perception of the reality of life,"" through which the author plans to outline the deeper significance of things that are less well explored.


Food for thought

The project will contain a number of stimuli intended to give viewers the chance to reflect, pose a series of questions, and then present several possible guidelines, while the answers are entirely up to the viewer. 



Authenticity
Information will be conveyed by imagery mixed with authentic sound and the traveler's thoughts. The film will present proof of the reality of true phenomena, and it is possible that it could cause considerable controversy.


Positive atmosphere of the film

From a dramatic perspective, great emphasis will be placed on the overall positive atmosphere and good vibe of the film. The final outcome will not elicit negative reactions such as anger or feelings of guilt or regret but just the opposite of those emotions. 


On a very personal level


The uniqueness of the image linked guarantees close contact with the native population and the experience from the places that we have on a very personal level, which allows us to avoid the usual clichés and present an unprecedented view of the exotic corners of our planet, which has a vast moral, spiritual, and material value and promises inimitable audio and video passages. The documentary will be mostly pictorial accompanied by commentary. 


Filming locations
The filming locations are carefully selected so that they are abundant in the natural phenomena of different species (rainforests, mountains, sandy plains, the depths of the deep) as well as in the spiritual aspects of being and the ancient traditions of the indigenous people.

PUBLIC RELEASE
Breath-Taking Documentary About Amazon Rainforest Needs Support On INDIEGOGO

The Inside Of Us is a unique documentary by a heroic filmmaking team from The Czech Republic, and it needs funding on INDIEGOGO. Told through the feelings of the Amazon Rainforest’s indigenous people, the film starkly shows the destruction of the people’s culture, homes, and their source of precious medicines. The Inside Of Us stresses the importance of the Amazon Rainforest, and its social value to Western society. Rather than outrage, The Inside Of Us aims to guide viewers toward awareness and action to protect the Amazon Rainforest and its people. 

To keep The Inside Of Us independent, the filmmakers ask for public help on INDIEGOGO.  They have personally invested nearly $100,000 while refusing lucrative contract offers. A free preview of the first 10 minutes of The Inside Of Us is available to journalists and potential donors.
The Inside Of Us features three renowned scientists: theoretical physicist Amit Goswami, anthropologist Jeremy Narby and psychiatrist Stanislav Grof. Producer Oldrich Tamas is the winner of the International JURI Prize from a prestigious Czech film festival.  Tamas’ artistic collaborator, Jan Rajnoha, directs the film. The Inside Of Us was shot in 5 countries on 3 continents. Filming began in 2013 in the Amazon Rainforest of Peru and Ecuador in South America, in North America in New York, and in Europe’s Switzerland and The Czech Republic. Using cutting-edge technology, The Inside of Us is top-quality viewing.

The filmmakers choose to remain independent, refusing to accept any private-sector funds that would interfere with the artistic control of The Inside Of Us. Ambitious international plans are underway for The Inside Of Us. The film will be distributed to some 300 TV stations worldwide. Screenings will be held at major international festivals. Anyone funding The Inside Of Us via INDIEGOGO will have access to free online pre-premiere screening.

The Inside Of Us project will be 6 films, highlighting some of the most precious environmental, human and social values on Earth. Future plans include shooting the lush jungles of Borneo, shedding more light on Nepal’s earthquake victims, and introducing people to Diamond Way Buddhism. Now, the filmmakers request the public help them complete the first film, The Inside Of Us. Part One calls for protecting the human and cultural values of the Amazon Rainforest. Further support is needed to start shooting the next part, which will feature the unique relics and ancient wisdom of Mexico.

The Inside Of Us is a powerful documentary, chronicling the life of a man who leaves modern Western civilization, travelling the world seeking answers to life’s burning questions. He arrives in the Amazon Rainforest, where he shows the alarming destruction of our planet, the need to protect the ancient wisdom of shamans, and illustrates a new path of consciousness to one’s inner harmony.

Now, the filmmakers have launched a 60-day campaign on INDIEGOGO to raise $340,000. Every donor is rewarded; larger donations give people the chance to enjoy an expedition to the Amazon Rainforest to experience ancient cultures and the wisdom of local shamans. Tomas Moravek heads the fundraising. He is the winner of the Manager of the Year Award and holds the European LABEL Prize for teaching the blind.

<h3>A Little about Us.</h3>
<p>Hamba Kahle is a short film that is written and directed by Renessa Mahabeer.</p>
<p>This film has a strong production team from various backgrounds, which is composed mainly of women  who have joined forces to create this truly special film. We have a very talented cinematographer from Mexico, Marina San Martin who has a unique cinematic style and is a great asset to this team.</p>

<p>This global cast and crew are excited about shooting this film and we need your help to make this film a reality.<br/><br/>Hamba Kahle is a film that plays into themes that everyone can relate to. Our main character, Sandi is in her early twenties and is living in the city of Johannesburg. She gets a call from her sister back home, her father is ill and she has to rush to his side.</p>
<p>When Sandi gets home, we realise that not only has she not been home in many years, but she left the village with many unresolved issues. This film follows her path down the lane of self discovery and forgiveness. When it comes to family, the bond runs deep.<br/><br/>Our team comes from all over the world. We relate to the feeling of being away from home and all that comes with it. Home is not just a house that you live in, it is also about your history, culture, memories and relationships.</p>
<p>Being away from home is a lonely experience, it also gives you a greater appreciation of your home and your family. In this film, we explore all of these themes, as well as the concept of self forgiveness and acceptance. </p>
<p>This film is incited by heartbreaking circumstances that makes our audience appreciate what is really important in life. We often overlook the important things in life when we get wrapped up in busy lifestyles and superficial goals. This movie strips away the layers to get down to the core values and emotions we all have.</p>

Many years later, she is forced to return home and face the consequences of her actions. She is filled with fear and regret but she decides to do what is needed for herself and her loved ones. This story is about growing up, facing your past to make peace, and repairing your soul by fixing your relationships.</p>

</div><div>The Hamba Kahle Team.</div><p><br/></p></div>","A Little about Us.
Hamba Kahle is a short film that is written and directed by Renessa Mahabeer.
This film has a strong production team from various backgrounds, which is composed mainly of women  who have joined forces to create this truly special film. We have a very talented cinematographer from Mexico, Marina San Martin who has a unique cinematic style and is a great asset to this team.
The producers of this film are Renessa Mahabeer, Kgomotso Mashilo and Isabel Catalán Sada. We have sourced a well accomplished cast to bring this story to life.
This global cast and crew are excited about shooting this film and we need your help to make this film a reality.Hamba Kahle is a film that plays into themes that everyone can relate to. Our main character, Sandi is in her early twenties and is living in the city of Johannesburg. She gets a call from her sister back home, her father is ill and she has to rush to his side.
When Sandi gets home, we realise that not only has she not been home in many years, but she left the village with many unresolved issues. This film follows her path down the lane of self discovery and forgiveness. When it comes to family, the bond runs deep.Our team comes from all over the world. We relate to the feeling of being away from home and all that comes with it. Home is not just a house that you live in, it is also about your history, culture, memories and relationships.
Being away from home is a lonely experience, it also gives you a greater appreciation of your home and your family. In this film, we explore all of these themes, as well as the concept of self forgiveness and acceptance. 
This film is incited by heartbreaking circumstances that makes our audience appreciate what is really important in life. We often overlook the important things in life when we get wrapped up in busy lifestyles and superficial goals. This movie strips away the layers to get down to the core values and emotions we all have.

How you can Help.This short film is a great cinematic movie that appeals to all generations, nationalities and backgrounds. With your help, we can breathe life into this film.
In order to make this film, we need to raise our production costs and this is where you can contribute to our dream of making this film come true. 

With your pledges, you will enable us to hire our  gear, pay our amazing actors, get unique costume and art design, and get provisions for a week's worth of shooting.
Each donation will have a wonderful reward such as Hand made African blankets, as well as personalised gifts from our well-known cast and many more! Please have a look at our rewards!.
In  the case that we are unable to reach our target, all the money will go into the bare basics of the film. Our cast will make this film because they are passionate about the story and they believe in this film. The money that we raise will be invested into gear rental first, as all of the crew are travelling and working pro bono.


The Impact
Sandi, our main character, returns home to find the wreckage that she caused when she left. Sandi left home in an immature and selfish manner. Many years later, she is forced to return home and face the consequences of her actions. She is filled with fear and regret but she decides to do what is needed for herself and her loved ones. This story is about growing up, facing your past to make peace, and repairing your soul by fixing your relationships.

Family and friendship is important to all of us and it helps us mould who we are, We have placed this universal story into a small African village which further exemplifies that no matter where in the world we are from, we all have the same emotions.

This short film is directed by the very talented and experienced director, Renessa Mahabeer. She is a working industry professional that has a vast background in everything from short films to broadcast television and music videos.

Sodom & Gomorrah is a modern, gay retelling of The Odd Couple, following two brand new friends working together to hack it in the gay-borhoods of Los Angeles despite their differing expression of their homosexuality in their day-to-day lives. Summary
Sam, an over-the-top, full-fledged participant in gay culture, yearns to find a place where he isn’t the “odd gay out”, while his best friend and roommate, Geoff, is much more reserved and pragmatic, and unfamiliar with many typical gay cultural touchstones. 

Working
in tandem, Sam and Geoff offer one another support as they come face to face
with difficult realities and personal shortcomings while starting their new
careers and lives in West Hollywood. In the web series adaptation of the
pilot, we will humorously explore the different experiences of being gay

Daniel Martinez Jr. 


Daniel Martinez Jr. may have
spent the last 6 years living in San Franscisco, but he’ll always be from San
Jose, CA (#siliconvalley). Daniel is casting for ""Sodom & Gomorrah"". Currently a first year MFA student in the Writing
and Producing for Television program at LMU, Daniel is also a part time actor
whose goal is to write, produce, and star in his own show(s) – he wants to
learn it all! As an actor, Daniel has been featured in the web series “Cost of
Living” as well as a commercial for Yik Yak. Fun thing he's ""proud"" of: Daniel was a core
extra for the film “Steve Jobs” and fangirled HARD when he got to see Kate
Winslet and Michael Fassbender up close. Even though Seth Rogen had lunch with
the extras and sat at the same table, Daniel was too afraid to talk to him.

Elias Ontiveros


Elias is from Ventura, CA and is working on locations and
permits for “Sodom & Gomorrah”. Elias has so much fun in pre-production as
a producer and screenwriter and is always up for new experiences. One day Elias
hopes to create his own network and/or production company. Fun thing he's ""proud"" of: Elias
reinterpreted Toy Story as a live-action black comedy about mental patients in
an insane asylum.

Currently a freelance editor, DJ will be in the “Sodom & Gomorrah” editing
room and lend a hand on set. DJ directed and edited the short documentary Scomparendo and the short
film The Clocks Don't Work. Fun thing he’s “proud” of: DJ once edited The Truman Show to play like Arrested
Development!

What We Need  As an MFA thesis project, the student is responsible for funding their own project. While we have access to camera and lighting equipment, there's quite a bit that the student has to shoulder. We'll be shooting for five days and your donation will contribute to the costs of:   Location permits
Craft services for cast & crew
Production design
Transportation 
Post-production expenses
   The Impact A thesis project acts as an initial calling card when a student launches their career in the entertainment industry. Through collaboration with other students and young professionals, we have an opportunity to showcase our creative voice and ambition. Our budget is modest, but the talent we've pulled together is dedicated to delivering a polished product. 
And we're unique. With a focus on LGBT characters and narrative, we hope to bring an honest and refreshing portrayal of friendship in the gay community, a perspective that is often left out of mainstream entertainment.
What You Get
Not only do you get to be a part of an exciting project, but we have plenty of fun swag to show our appreciation! Don't forget to check out the Sodom & Gomorrah perks! Here's peak at the goods:

<p>The documentary will most probably become <b>the most

the forest in <b>all seasons</b>, so the production will last until the<b> end of 2016</b>. There will be night and day scenes. The techniques used will be similar
to those of an artistic documentary. The script will strictly take into account the
<b>stories</b> of the people who visited the forest. There will be no embellishment,
mystification or manipulation. </p>Anyone can help promoting this <b>unique place</b>. We know a lot of you are curious about it already, especially because the Hoia-Baciu Forest is worldwide known due to the first <b>UFO ever captured on a camera</b> (the picture was taken by military-technician Emil Barnea in <b>1968</b>).  <p></p>

<p>In order to provide tourists<b> quality video souvenirs</b>, we

</div></div>","“The Hoia-Baciu Forest – Truth or Legend” travel documentary 


About the documentary: 

“The Hoia-Baciu
Forest – Truth or Legend”  is the first
professional travel documentary ever made about the Hoia-Baciu Forest. Deep in
Transylvania, an area long-associated with vampiric legend and horror, lie almost
300 hectares of dense woodland, called The Hoia-Baciu Forest. The place is
believed to be the most haunted forest in the world. 



For over 60 years, it’s
been told that this place makes you see and feel inexplicable things, it makes
your cameras malfunction and it gives you the shivers as soon as you step into
it. No wonder paranormal lovers all over the world strive to come here as often
as they can. It is almost impossible to make the difference between the truth
and the legends told about this place.





This is why we are
in the process of making the first professional travel documentary about the
Hoia-Baciu Forest. The touristic potential of this forest is huge and nobody
has ever exploited it so far. Each year, hundreds of foreigners come here in
search of paranormal experiences. Even if they don’t experience anything
unusual, they still notice that the forest is strange. Almost all trees here are scabby, twisted and bizarre. The documentary will include remakes of stories told by
people who say they have experienced strange phenomena while visiting the
forest. There will also be included some testimonies of Romanian and foreign
tourists that claim to have lived inexplicable moments, but also interviews
with locals and different researchers.  All
these will be shot using high performance devices. The final editing will not
include misrepresentations, but it will still be captivating. 




The aim of the project is to create a professional
touristic documentary, that can be compared to the most wanted documentaries abroad. Part of the money gained from selling the documentary will
be used for cleaning the forest and supplying touristic guidance on wooden panels
in the forest. 


Who are we and what do we do? 

The people involved in this project are all professionals. The producer of this film (Cosmin Giurgiu) has 8 years of experience in
tourism promotion, 15 years in video production and 4 years in aerial filming. He owns Transylvania’s most visited website, www.ghidvideoturistic.ro.
He enjoys promoting travel destinations more than traveling itself. He is
responsible for all video concept and content.



The associate producer of the documentary (Laura Calugar) is an experienced TV
journalist, that took this personal project as a challenge. She is responsible
for all English and Romanian texts in the documentary, but also scripts,
stories and interviews. 
Alex Surducan and Marius Lazin run an NGO that promotes different activities in the Hoia-Baciu Forest. They also organize private tours in the forest and greening actions in the woods. They love this forest and its bizarre trees and they are striving each day to protect and promote it. They are responsible for all documentation needed.



How can you help? 

The documentary will most probably become the most
wished-for souvenir of Romanian and foreign tourists. It will include images of
the forest in all seasons, so the production will last until the end of 2016. There will be night and day scenes. The techniques used will be similar
to those of an artistic documentary. The script will strictly take into account the
stories of the people who visited the forest. There will be no embellishment,
mystification or manipulation. Anyone can help promoting this unique place. We know a lot of you are curious about it already, especially because the Hoia-Baciu Forest is worldwide known due to the first UFO ever captured on a camera (the picture was taken by military-technician Emil Barnea in 1968).  

In order to provide tourists quality video souvenirs, we
need your help. We need 20,000$ to be sure that this documentary will be ready to sell by the beginning of this December. The documentary will be shot all
year because we want to capture the forest’s aspect in every season, so we’ll be
working and needing funds for 10 months. We have most of the equipment
necessary, but we still need more. With your help, we can raise money for:


· 
Sound Mixing
· 
Color Correction
· 
Music
· 
Car maintenance
· 
Design and printing
· 
German, French and Hungarian translations 
· 
Web design
· 
Outdoor equipment 
· 
Night filming equipment
· 
And the list goes on...



We are really enthusiastic about this project and with your
help, we can make Transylvania and the Hoia-Baciu Forest one of the most
visited places in the world. www.lonelyplanet.com nominated Transylvania as the
best travel destination in 2016. Be part of this travel experience! Your
generosity will contribute to developing a high quality product that any
tourist will be excited to own. Moreover, your kindness will help keep the
forest clean as we plan to organize greening actions during the summer.  



The impact:
We've already gotten the attention of media on this. They

<p>""Born a century too late."" The melancholic hope of 1930s and 40s cultural history is a passion I accrued from many an afternoon spent listening to the endless songs and stories of my Grandparents. Sadly, I lost my Grandmother to an 8 year battle with cancer but I honoured her memory in one of my early films <i>For Judith</i>. Following this I made a second version of the film in 3D.</p>
<p>Judith, my grandmother, introduced me to the hollywood classics that would come to shape me as I became a young man with a burning passion for that bygone era of cinema. I became a filmmaker because I adored the power of sound and images on the soul, their power to truly shake, challenge and change each and everyone of us, alone in the dark. <i>It’s a universal language that transcends any and all words and gives us pure honest empathy.</i></p>
<p>Losing someone so dear is a remarkably transformative experience, but pain births the most impactful art. Loss and grief have become integral themes in all my work.

</div></div>","Nostalgia, lies, love and loss. My Heart Is All I Have is an homage to the golden age of Hollywood, and the Golden age of the movie musical– it is the embodiment of a lifelong love. 
The film is about people living unfulfilled lives, trapped as who they think they should be and learning to let go of that facade and love, with honesty and compassion.
As an international student, I left Britain in 2012 to pursue a BFA in Film and Television at the Savannah College of Art and Design. My love for film was born through years of laughing, crying and singing along to the great melodramas and musicals of the 30s and 40s. I always felt as though nothing has ever reached those rose-tinted heights since and by hook or by crook I had to take people back there.
Fortunately enough I have a remarkable crew of talented and creative individuals who are working diligently to bring this film to life, seasoned producers, cinematographers, editors, choreographers, costume designs and more– the gang's all here!
Where will your money go?
- On screen talent  (actors, dancers, extras, transportation, hotels, food).
- Securing locations (rental, insurance, crew transportation).
- Creation of original costumes and production design materials, props, trinkets, posters, all to ensure an authentic look.
- Writing and recording of the original score by the Pasadena Roof Orchestra,  a beautifully realised cinematic suite that harkens to the unforgettable sounds of times gone by.
-Technicalities (advanced equipment rental, hard drive space, software, copyright licenses, festival submission fees, marketing, distribution).
Of course you won't go unrewarded. As well as our eternal love and gratitude you'll receive beautiful perks for your contribution. These include a copy of the film before it's festival release, your name in the credits, a copy of the original soundtrack, the poster of the film as seen in the film and much more!

    Of all the short films in all the towns in all the world, why fund mine? Don't grovel Rick, I'll show you why– because we have some of the most dedicated, hardworking, and professional young visionary talent pouring all their passion into this film.
Co-Writer & Director – Jordan Hill (as seen below with his very proud Mum)




""Born a century too late."" The melancholic hope of 1930s and 40s cultural history is a passion I accrued from many an afternoon spent listening to the endless songs and stories of my Grandparents. Sadly, I lost my Grandmother to an 8 year battle with cancer but I honoured her memory in one of my early films For Judith. Following this I made a second version of the film in 3D.
Judith, my grandmother, introduced me to the hollywood classics that would come to shape me as I became a young man with a burning passion for that bygone era of cinema. I became a filmmaker because I adored the power of sound and images on the soul, their power to truly shake, challenge and change each and everyone of us, alone in the dark. It’s a universal language that transcends any and all words and gives us pure honest empathy.
Losing someone so dear is a remarkably transformative experience, but pain births the most impactful art. Loss and grief have become integral themes in all my work. To love, to miss, to honour, to make proud. Below are some of my previous works, for more please visit my website.

Hello, all!
My name is Pernell Langhorne III. This is my third year as a film
student at Regent University in Virginia Beach. My Disney Bad Blood
Music Video is about a young girl named Kairi from the hit video
game, Kingdom Hearts. Kairi is faced with the betrayal of her friend,
Naminé, and must assemble the Disney Princesses you all know and love
to fight against a threat that could destroy them all. </p>
<p>
This
project is not only important to me but to everyone that is involved.
It will provide a chance for us as film students to branch out and do
something different to perfect our skills and have a valuable asset
in our resumes. This also gives a chance for the character in the game, Kairi, to be more important because she has not received the credit she deserves. Our team believes that no woman, within any platform, should be left unnoticed and undermined. </p>
<p>
Our
goal is to raise $1000 for food, wardrobe, sets, and travel costs. We are
having beautiful, handmade costumes and props being crafted and there are some pretty awesome perks included with your donations! </p>
<p>Spread the word and let everyone know about this music video so that it can go viral! We want Taylor Swift herself to share it! Updates, pictures, and videos will also be posted during our journey because we want you to be a part of the process. There is a determined and passionate cast and crew behind this and we want to do our absolute best with this project. So please, help us bring the magic of Disney's Kingdom Hearts and the epicness of Taylor Swift's ""Bad Blood"" to reality!</p>

<p>MY MOM AND THE GIRL is a true story based on an odd encounter my East Coast mother, who suffers with Alzheimer's, shared one evening on the streets of East L.A. The story takes off after dinner with family and friends takes a dark turn and my mother is led to a proverbial crossroads where three very disparate - desperate -women are unpredictably pulled back into the light.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">It's a funny, poignant and surprisingly rich story where apparent disabilities can be seen as gifts.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;"">A few years ago my 82-year-old mother and love of my life, Norma Holzer, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and, as for so many families in America, ours was thrown into a nightmare of fear, guilt, obligation and confusion. I quickly discovered that most people are afraid to face, let alone embrace, a situation as abhorrent as Alzheimer's, and as a result, I was my mom's designated - make that only - caregiver.  Awful, right?</span></p>

<p>My Mom and The Girl is rich in Irony and Humor, elements that reign supreme when it comes to neutralizing
stereotypes, giving social critique and instigating transformation
by holding up a mirror and forcing us to confront realities that we prefer
to ignore. (<i>Think All In The Family, Blackish, Fresh Off The Boat and Derek.</i>)</p>
<h4>OUR TEAM</h4>

<p>We are so excited and honored to have <b>Valerie Harper </b>to play the role of Nanny, my mom.

My Mom and The Girl is proud to announce our latest partnership with The Handshake Foundation 

The partnership supports THF's on-going mission to inspire young talent and career
aspirations. Students will be given an opportunity to get practical and hands

hard and learn a lot.  WIN-WIN!! AND - there' more!!  Students selected
will receive a financial grant through THF to continue their studies.
Interested students should complete the application and return it by April 4. We are SO EXCITED and look forward to mentoring new talent!! Big Thanks to the THF founder MARK HELLER!!!! 
And if you haven't yet, check out the wonderful article from journalist/writer Lorraine Devon Wilke on the Huffington Post. 
*Thanks to Richard Rossi for a fabulous interview on his talk show on Blog Talk Radio! Listen to his AMAZING prediction for My Mom and The Girl at 16:22!!

It takes a village. With your help and the help of organizations like UsAgainstAlzheimer's and Alzheimer's Greater Los Angeles, My Mom and The Girl is possible.



We are so proud to announce that a percentage of your donations to the production of My Mom and The Girl will be shared with our AMAZING Fiscal Sponsor UsAgainstAlzheimer's which is making giant steps towards finding a cure for Alzheimer's and has made it possible for your donations to be tax deductible. It's a win-win-win for UsAgainstAlzheimer's, My Mom and The Girl & You!!! 


NOW, THE WHO, WHAT, WHY & HOW
THE WHO

So, who the heck we are? We are Go Girl Media, and as writers and producers, my partner, Don Priess, and I, Susie Singer Carter, consider ourselves fortunate to have worked on a variety of television and film projects and collaborate with wonderfully talented people like (and here comes the ""name dropping/hoping to impress you"" part)  Bryan Cranston, Jon Voight, Shia LaBeouf, Helen Hunt, Dennis Quaid, Max Brooks and Kenan Thompson, to name a few. 







            Here's a quick splashy sizzle of some of our work. 









THE WHAT
MY MOM AND THE GIRL is a true story based on an odd encounter my East Coast mother, who suffers with Alzheimer's, shared one evening on the streets of East L.A. The story takes off after dinner with family and friends takes a dark turn and my mother is led to a proverbial crossroads where three very disparate - desperate -women are unpredictably pulled back into the light. It's a funny, poignant and surprisingly rich story where apparent disabilities can be seen as gifts.

                                          
It's a story that elicits the same response from everyone who hears it:                  
                         

THE WHY
A few years ago my 82-year-old mother and love of my life, Norma Holzer, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and, as for so many families in America, ours was thrown into a nightmare of fear, guilt, obligation and confusion. I quickly discovered that most people are afraid to face, let alone embrace, a situation as abhorrent as Alzheimer's, and as a result, I was my mom's designated - make that only - caregiver.  Awful, right?


  




















Well, not exactly...  Even though my mother’s decline has been devastating, by embracing it, I have received countless unexpected gifts of insight, understanding and joy filled with humor, music and a whole lot of love. 
This led me to think, ""I DO need to film this story!"" And so I am! 
I want to replace fear with clarity and inspire a new conversation that includes gratitude and joy. 
 




THE HOW
With Badass Superpowers: Irony and Humor, an Amazing Team and You!

My Mom and The Girl is rich in Irony and Humor, elements that reign supreme when it comes to neutralizing
stereotypes, giving social critique and instigating transformation
by holding up a mirror and forcing us to confront realities that we prefer
to ignore. (Think All In The Family, Blackish, Fresh Off The Boat and Derek.)
OUR TEAM

We are so excited and honored to have Valerie Harper to play the role of Nanny, my mom. When Valerie and my mom met at the Silverado Beverly Place (in my opinion, the BEST assisted care facility in Los Angeles), it was crystal clear we could not have found anyone better. What a day!!

  





SHOW US THE LOVE   

                                                                         


THE WHERE


We need a minimum of $60,000 to produce and distribute My Mom and The Girl. Where do your funds
go and just what do they support?

Our budget includes film industry standards like wages for our crew, equipment, travel expenses, marketing/promotion, editing, sound/color correction, and more!!
Below you can see just how we expect to put your funds to work in this picture of me wearing what is known as a “Hat Of Distribution”. (It’s not really known. But I do love a great hat.)

<p>My name is Evan Hara and I am a student/film director in Dallas, Texas. I've been doing films for a number of years and have won and entered many different film festivals.

I really have a passion for sci-fi films in particular because I love how they can make you question reality and life in general.

About 1/3 of the budget is going toward all of our actors and the rest will go toward make-up, props, costumes, etc. We have many scenes where we will have to hang our actors in a green room to simulate floating in space!

he is missing all of the joy and contentment that God has for him.  After
a second chance, he is awakened to the immense treasure he possesses and the
beauty of his beloved hometown.</p>

 A Matter of Perspective
- A short narrative fictional film  based on original story and screenplay by Jeff Gerke.  Starring Rich Swingle--known for his lead roles in Providence and Indescribable, as well as contributions in over 20 films.
________________________________________

When a businessman’s discontentment nearly costs him his career, he is awakened to the treasure he's had all along.


A Matter of Perspective is a story about a middle-aged Christian gift company
administrator who has drifted from the vibrant, contagious faith that he once
had, and somehow has become dissatisfied.  Even while living and working in a
breathtaking rural community in Southern Oregon, he continued to grow bitter
until one day, during a pivotal moment, he is shamed into the realization that
he is missing all of the joy and contentment that God has for him.  After
a second chance, he is awakened to the immense treasure he possesses and the
beauty of his beloved hometown.

What We Need & What You Get
 Peace Films is currently working on three films:


The Peacemakers. This is a series of short films about people and organizations in war zones who are actively working for peace.

The Impact
 If U.S. foreign policy continues on the same track, there will be more wars, more terrorism, and bigger mass refugee migrations—and the resulting death, trauma and environmental degradation. Because war is so lucrative for the 1%, it will only stop when the American people demand that it stop. Promise of Peace will inform Americans as to what our country is doing, and show that peace is possible. This is the first step in creating change—understanding the problem. Risks & Challenges Our biggest risk is NOT speaking out. The military-industrial complex is a multi-trillion dollar industry—however when it becomes evident that ""the emperor wears no clothes,"" than real change can be implemented. Together we are standing up for peace and for humanity.

<h2>THE EARLY BERN<br/>
</h2>When Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy last May, the first polls showed him over 50 points behind Hillary Clinton -- a lead that many thought was insurmountable.  But as Hillary Clinton began what many thought was a victory lap across the United States, something remarkable began happening -- concerned citizens like you and me started to believe the unbelievable -- that Senator Bernie Sanders will be the next President of the United States.  His message, and the integrity that he communicated it with resonated so strongly that, only nine months later, he's accomplished what most thought impossible -- he's raised over $100 million through donations averaging $27, he's spoken to hundreds of thousands of people, chalked up a near tie in Iowa, won New Hampshire by a landslide, and came from over 40 points behind in Nevada which was considered Clinton's ""firewall"" to nearly tie with her there.  After racking up four wins and a virtual tie on Super Tuesday, it is now clear that Bernie is a serious contender for the Democratic nomination. <br/><br/>Polls and primaries have shown that when people get to know Bernie, his support increases exponentially.  There is a clear path for victory if Bernie's campaign and his supporters can immediately deploy cost effective and creative strategies that can get Bernie and his message out to the other states 
quickly.<br/><br/>But Bernie can only be in one place at a time, right?<br/><br/><h2>TURNING UP THE HEAT<br/>

</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b> A JOURNEY FROM
LOSS TO LOVE, LIGHT &amp; LAUGHTER -</b></span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> PART 2</b><br/></p><p>My first campaign: A Journey from Loss to Love, Light &amp; Laughter - Part 1 raised $3,111 -- this should fund my first 3 months in India and Thailand.  To go further with my journey, I am asking for more help.  </p><p>Here is the background and the basis for this journey:</p>
<p><b>BACKGROUND &amp; JOURNEY OVERVIEW</b></p>
<p>I know loss.  I
lost my biological father at 3.  I lost my sense of worth from being
molested at age 11.  I lost my belief in dreams when I was rejected by my
dream college at 18.  I lost in love from two failed marriages.  I
lost my children, all five of them to miscarriages.  These losses affected
how I thought about myself and I allowed myself to be pulled down by them. (If
you would like to learn more about what led me to this point, see the
additional video in the gallery link.) No more.</p>
<p>However, this is not a
journey of loss.  At its core, this is a journey of reset and expanding
love.  I am resetting my thoughts and my life. I am expanding love in the
world by volunteering along my journey and spotlighting others who add light to
the world.  And, there will be laughter, playfulness, and dancing along
the way.</p>
<p>My campaign is to help
support this journey.  I envision this journey as taking 1 year, and
leading me to India, Thailand, Peru, Panama, Haiti, France, England, Ireland,
and ending with cross-country road trip of the US.  The number of
countries I go depends on the amount that I raise through this campaign.  My budget for this complete journey is $42,000, which  allows for the full year to all the countries listed.  </p>
<p>For my volunteer
efforts, I will work with organizations dedicated to helping children, the
poor, refugees, the environment, and advancing social good.  As of now, I
secured my volunteer efforts in India (Missionaries of Charity (founded by
Mother Theresa)) and Thailand (English for Engaged Social Service).  From
here, it depends on you.   Each place that you send me, I will volunteer
and pay it forward through my service.</p>
<p>This campaign is important
to me because it is my whole life.  The idea of this journey came to me in
one my moments of darkness.  In the early months after the separation, I
was lost in sadness. I had already picked myself so many times in the past; I
was not sure if I could do it again. Then, one day as I was laying in bed (all
day), this journey was a glimmer of light.  As I started to daydream about
it, I was looking forward to my future. I could not contain this journey as a
simple dream.  I shared this journey with my mastermind group and business
coach. They saw my vision.  They empowered me to take this journey that
started as a glimmer in darkness.  So, here I am taking a leap of faith
and believing in dreams again!</p>
<p>My sincere hope is
that this journey adds love, light and laughter for others.  I will have a
website and blog to share my journey as it unfolds.  If I can change my
negative self-talk to a genuine self-love; if I can shine after loss; if I can
create a life of love, light and laughter -- anyone can.  </p>
<p>I do not know where,
when, or how it will end or what the next journey will be.  I hope that by
sharing my journey with you, you will feel as if you had your own journey too –
and we share some smiles, laughter, and make our mark with light and love along
the way.</p>
<p><b>WHAT I NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</b></p>
<p>The $42,000 allows for
the full year to all the countries listed and the development of podcast and
website to dedicated to spotlight those who are adding light in the world.</p>
<p>If I do not raise all
$42,000, I will shorten my country list.  The journey will continue but
may adjust to reflect the monies raised.  </p>
<p><b>What you get:  </b>If you contribute:</p>
<p> $1.00, you will
get a note of appreciation and get an invitation to join a closed Facebook
Group where I will post updates of the journey along the way.</p>
<p>$25.00 or more, in
addition to the above, you will get a vote on various journey options.
 For instance, part of this journey is for me to get out of my comfort
zones and simply trust.  Facebook Group members are invited suggest dares
and challenges for me.  Those who donate $25 or more will get to vote on
which dare or challenge I do.</p>
<p>$100.00 or more, in addition
to the above, you will get an e-photobook of the journey.</p>
<p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>

<p>Filmmaking is not a cheap business. To aim for the film grade that we hope to shoot in, we need the proper funds to provide us with the proper equipment and financial flexibility to maximize this production.</p>

<p>Funding to give back to the communities we visit. We aim to spotlight every place we visit and give exposure to certain social issues without the bias of a media outlet.

So what on earth do we need? 
 Funding and the moral support to make this happen! 
Filmmaking is not a cheap business. To aim for the film grade that we hope to shoot in, we need the proper funds to provide us with the proper equipment and financial flexibility to maximize this production.
Funding for transportation. We need a good solid vehicle to aid us in the physical transportation of our work across the country as well as the protection of our equipment. 
Funding to give back to the communities we visit. We aim to spotlight every place we visit and give exposure to certain social issues without the bias of a media outlet. We aim to give raw information based on the information we get from our interviews from Canadians. This is the backbone and story to our film, 
Funding for food. We are three guys, that's pretty self-explanatory,    How is this going to impact anything?  We have experience in commercial photography as well as filmmaking. The most recent one being a full-length testimonial video as well as a promotional video made for the Community Foundation of Northwestern Alberta. We ultimately have the tools and talent to showcase Canada without the filter of media bias. We want to unite Canadians as one independent of race, religion, political perpective, and wealth.    Risks & Challenges This is not going to be easy, that's for sure. But, Perseverance is something that is alive and strong within us. Misfortunes may and most likely will happen, but that will not stop us from providing content. We will document it all. 

So, let's make some noise and get this project rolling.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<i>Scouting
for Diamonds is a feature-length documentary film about the invisible heroes of
baseball: the scouts. It’s about the men (and women) who are blessed and cursed
by an unwavering commitment to their first love: baseball. <br/></i>
<p><i>In the film we meet
dozens of men and women who have given their lives to the game in search of that 'next great
player.' Told from the perspective of legendary players and the scouts who
discovered them, the film reaches into their hearts, and ours, as we learn what scouts see in players that no one else can. And it is about the ‘art of
scouting’ and an era of scouting that is, perhaps facing extinction.  <br/></i></p>

<h3>From The Director</h3> <p>Molly Secours &amp; Bottom Of The Ninth Films here in Nashville TN wishing you all a beautiful 2016! <br/></p>
<p>Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd be directing &amp; producing a feature documentary film about baseball scouts. Ever. Up until now most of my work has been in the non-profit world of social justice advocating for the 'under dog'. And after hearing about a guy named George Digby, a Boston Red Sox scout who
 signed dozens of great players including Hall Of Famer, Wade Boggs, I 
realized there were hundreds--if not thousands--of scouts who have 
devoted their lives to combing the
 bushes in search of that 'next great player'.  And although Mr. Dibgy 
is honored and recognized by the Boston Red Sox, most scouts remain 
anonymous. And because of the generosity, sincerity and blessing of Wade Boggs, we pressed forward. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451858245/ohwrfc3ft9atifo68r7w.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 547.354px;height: 437px;""/></p>
<b><i>Boston Red Sox scout, George Digby with  HOFer Ted Williams<br/><br/></i></b>
<p>For the past year and a half we have been interviewing MLB Hall Of Famers, scouts (and their spouses), managers, &amp; executives--all who have helped us in unearthing the untold love story between scouts and the game of baseball. And during this process not only have we fallen in love with scouts ourselves but for some of us, creating this film has rekindled a love for America's favorite pastime.  And we have a feeling that once people meet these gems, a new generation of baseball fans will emerge. We are determined to bring scouts out of the shadows and onto the big screen--where they belong. And that's where you come in. </p>
<p></p>

<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>Obviously, as independent filmmakers, we need money to finish the film. In addition to traveling the US, our story brings us to Cuba, Dominican Republic and perhaps even Japan. And because there is no big Hollywood studio picking up the tab, we must lean on supporters.<br/></p>
<p> Until now, we've relied on a few generous angel investors who helped get us started. With their support we've spent time with some of the greatest living legends in baseball, including  <i>Wade Boggs, Willie Mays, George Brett, Tommy LaSorda, Dusty Baker </i>&amp; more (all whom you will meet in the film) and many others whose names are probably unfamiliar. <br/></p>
<p>The remaining budget needed is $1.1 million but to keep shooting in January, through Spring Training and beyond we are aiming for $550,000. Thus far we have had several teams commit pledges outside of Indiegogo so our goal here is $150,000.  As soon as we are finished with this portion of the show we can that will allow us to focus solely on our story!<br/></p>
<p>So, I guess you could say we need some new Bottom Of The Ninth 'angels' so we can continue filming for the next 9 months.</p>

Scouting For Diamonds: A Love Story
Scouting
for Diamonds is a feature-length documentary film about the invisible heroes of
baseball: the scouts. It’s about the men (and women) who are blessed and cursed
by an unwavering commitment to their first love: baseball. 
In the film we meet
dozens of men and women who have given their lives to the game in search of that 'next great
player.' Told from the perspective of legendary players and the scouts who
discovered them, the film reaches into their hearts, and ours, as we learn what scouts see in players that no one else can. And it is about the ‘art of
scouting’ and an era of scouting that is, perhaps facing extinction.  




August Georgia 1956                                                                       Photo credit: Helen Digby



From The Director Molly Secours & Bottom Of The Ninth Films here in Nashville TN wishing you all a beautiful 2016! 
Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine I'd be directing & producing a feature documentary film about baseball scouts. Ever. Up until now most of my work has been in the non-profit world of social justice advocating for the 'under dog'. And after hearing about a guy named George Digby, a Boston Red Sox scout who
 signed dozens of great players including Hall Of Famer, Wade Boggs, I 
realized there were hundreds--if not thousands--of scouts who have 
devoted their lives to combing the
 bushes in search of that 'next great player'.  And although Mr. Dibgy 
is honored and recognized by the Boston Red Sox, most scouts remain 
anonymous. And because of the generosity, sincerity and blessing of Wade Boggs, we pressed forward. 


Boston Red Sox scout, George Digby with  HOFer Ted Williams
For the past year and a half we have been interviewing MLB Hall Of Famers, scouts (and their spouses), managers, & executives--all who have helped us in unearthing the untold love story between scouts and the game of baseball. And during this process not only have we fallen in love with scouts ourselves but for some of us, creating this film has rekindled a love for America's favorite pastime.  And we have a feeling that once people meet these gems, a new generation of baseball fans will emerge. We are determined to bring scouts out of the shadows and onto the big screen--where they belong. And that's where you come in. 




Director, Molly Secours with HOFer George Brett & Veteran Scout Art Stewart


How Can You Help?


Obviously, as independent filmmakers, we need money to finish the film. In addition to traveling the US, our story brings us to Cuba, Dominican Republic and perhaps even Japan. And because there is no big Hollywood studio picking up the tab, we must lean on supporters.
 Until now, we've relied on a few generous angel investors who helped get us started. With their support we've spent time with some of the greatest living legends in baseball, including  Wade Boggs, Willie Mays, George Brett, Tommy LaSorda, Dusty Baker & more (all whom you will meet in the film) and many others whose names are probably unfamiliar. 
The remaining budget needed is $1.1 million but to keep shooting in January, through Spring Training and beyond we are aiming for $550,000. Thus far we have had several teams commit pledges outside of Indiegogo so our goal here is $150,000.  As soon as we are finished with this portion of the show we can that will allow us to focus solely on our story!
So, I guess you could say we need some new Bottom Of The Ninth 'angels' so we can continue filming for the next 9 months.

<p>Paralympic Stories is a travelling blog, collecting stories of paralympic athletes from Italy, Brazil, Argentina and all over the world. </p>
<p>Through these stories we promote sport as a way to include disabled people into the society. We consider our blog as a meeting place of the differences. </p>
<p>Paralympic Stories means discovering worlds, opening new roads, building networks, connecting people and inspiring them to communicate with the different, the stranger, the weird. </p>
<p>Our project is an indipendent project, carried on by a coordinator and few part-time bloggers, and living thanks to the athletes, the readers, the people we keep meeting everyday. </p>
<p>We rely on humanity more than on technology, and we feel really proud about it.</p>
<p>We speak, and write in, four languages: Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and English. The people involved in the project come from all across the world. </p>
<p>We have a dream: to bring our multicultural and multitasking team to RIO 2016 Paralympics Games, happening in Rio de Janeiro from 7th to 18th September 2016, and to do the media coverage of the games. </p>
<p>Paralympic Games are the ultimate expression of Paralympic sport worldwide. </p>
<p>They are also an important showcase for disabled athletse, who are not as famous as their ""normal"" collegues. despite the high quality of their performances.</p>
<p>This is why the blog must go to RIO 2016.</p>
<p>And why should you contribute to our crowdfunding campaign?</p>
<p>Until today we have managed to carry on our works thanks to the financing program Torno Subito of Lazio Region, covering the project's coordinating actions. </p>
<p>Bringing our team to Paralympics Games will mean to face extra costs, that will allow us to create an headquarter in Rio De Janeiro for two weeks, to cover the costs of transport, food and lodging for the team and to make some technical improvements for the blog. </p>
<p>We promise you we will do our best with the resources we will get. we promise you as well we will get you into a totally SPECIAL event, full of very SPECIAL people. </p>
<p>Join our campaign! Contribute with the amount you want and...pleeeaseee...spread it as much as you can!!!</p>

<p><strong>Il progetto <a href=""http://www.storieparalimpiche.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.storieparalimpiche.com</a></strong></p>
<p>Storie Paralimpiche è un blog itinerante, che dal 2014 sta viaggiando tra Italia, Brasile e Argentina per raccogliere e raccontare le storie di atleti Paralimpici.</p>
<p>Promuove lo sport come strumento di inclusione delle persone disabili e luogo d'incontro delle differenze.</p>
<p>E' scoprire mondi, aprire strade, costruire reti, è connettere mondi apparentemente distanti e scoprire che ci si può fare le stesse domande. </p>
<p>E'  un progetto indipendente, che vive grazie agli atleti, ai lettori, agli incontri di ogni giorno. I nostri potenti mezzi non hanno a che fare con la tecnica, ma con l'umanità, e questo ci rende orgogliosi. </p>
<p>E' un progetto che parla quattro lingue: italiano, portoghese, spagnolo e inglese, e in cui sono coinvolte persone, disabili e non, italiane, brasiliane e argentine. </p>
<p>Il nostro sogno è riuscire a portare la nostra squadra, multiculturale e multisfaccettata, ai Giochi Paralimpici di Rio 2016, <em>che si terranno dal 7 al 18 settembre 2016 a Rio de Janeiro, per lavorare alla copertura giornalistica dei giochi, raccontandoli da un punto di vista più interno e accessibile, quello delle stesse persone con disabilità.</em></p>
<p>Le Paralimpiadi sono la massima espressione dello sport paralimpico a livello mondiale, e ne custodiscono lo spirito. Inoltre sono una vetrina importante per questi atleti, che godono di molta meno visibilità rispetto ai loro colleghi ""normodotati"", nonostante la qualità delle loro prestazioni. </p>
<p>Per questo noi di Storie Paralimpiche ci teniamo a essere presenti a RIO 2016, per raccontarvi quello che succede, a modo nostro. Per farlo abbiamo bisogno del vostro aiuto!</p>
<p><strong>Perché dovreste contribuire alla nostra campagna di crowdfunding</strong></p>
<p>Fino ad oggi siamo riusciti a portare avanti il nostro lavoro grazie al finanziamento del programma Torno Subito della Regione Lazio, che finanzia le azioni di coordinamento del progetto. <br/>Per la fase dei giochi però prevediamo delle spese aggiuntive, che ci consentiranno di creare un quartier generale a Rio de Janeiro per due settimane, di coprire le spese di trasporto, vitto e alloggio per la squadra e di apportare alcune migliorie tecniche al blog, che nei giorni dei giochi sarà la vostra finestra sulle meraviglie che accadranno nella Cidade Maravilhosa. </p>
<p>Noi, come redazione, ci impegnamo a darvi il meglio con le risorse che riusciremo a ottenere, come abbiamo sempre fatto da quando il progetto è iniziato, nel settembre 2014.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding vuol dire finanziamento dal basso. Dal basso vuol dire da chi ci legge, da chi ci segue, da chi ci ha a cuore. </p>
<p>Perché dovreste aiutarci a finanziare il blog, e soprattutto contribuire alla trasferta dei redattori del blog alle Paralimpiadi, vi chiederete voi? Ce lo siamo chiesti anche noi, e abbiamo chiesto a ciascuno degli atleti che hanno partecipato al progetto di raccontare a modo loro cos'è il blog Storie Paralimpiche e perché è importante che continui a narrare le gesta di questi campioni così speciali. </p>
<p>Comunque, dovunque, sempre, le nostre storie siete voi, il blog siete voi, è nostro. </p>
<p>Dal canto nostro vi promettiamo che vi faremo entrare dentro un evento veramente speciale, popolato di persone veramente speciali!</p>
<p>La sfida è riuscirci con mezzi scarsi, con piccoli contributi, con semplicità.</p>
<p>Unitevi alla nostra campagna. Contribuite con la somma che volete, ma anche e soprattutto aiutandoci a divulgarla. <br/>Ogni piccolo gesto è prezioso, ogni passo è una falcata che ci e vi avvicina a RIO.</p>

Be apart of the film as a Executive producerMY LIFE STORY(About Me) I love to film and I love everything about it. The Creativity of it 
blows me into a world full of laughter and filled with deep emotion 
ready to be recorded with a cam and put on screen.I'm goofy not 
uptight and loves everyone. I have been hurt, rejected and still i love 
those you talk about me say i wont be successful and those who hate me 
just because. Throughout my childhood i was bullied by students 
and teachers. I remember my teacher wrote the letter L on my forehead 
and told me that i wasn't going to be successful and that i would never 
be like steven speilberg. She did that because at the age of 10 i said, i
 wanted to be like Steven Spielberg. she raised my hand in front of 
class (me feeling deep humiliation she called me a loser and everyone 
laughed.)That same day i was home alone and i wanted to commit 
suicide but, all of a sudden the tv came on and it was(UNPLUGGED) i kid 
you not. The television came on and Steven Spielberg's film came on 
called Jaws it inspired me to make films and it inspired me to help 
others in the process.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>Class Dismissed</b> is a hilarious new comedy web series centered
around three grade school friends, one nuisance and the unpredictable Assistant principal... Liz, the sassy tv extra
turned teacher's aide, Anne, the easy going, free spirited first
grade teacher who uses yoga and ti chi to teach her students
Math and English, BJ, the loud-mouthed PE teacher/failed
comedian and Nancy the nosy perfectionist teacher 
round out this crazy cast. After years apart BJ, Liz, and Anne find
themselves reunited back at the same grade school...only
this time they're in charge. What happens in the teachers
lounge, stays in the teachers lounge!

<p>GEORGE JAMES, a middle-aged eviction specialist, is hungry after a long day at the office. Like many of us, he doesn't like what he's doing but he just needs to survive another day. George is a satire that shows how far you are willing to go just to feel good about yourself.</p>

<p>Back in September 2016, Director Rui Pedro Sousa came to London with the goal of pursuing his career. Upon arriving, the Scripts of Zombie and George came into Rui's life and he decided to join his scripts Whispers and Awoken to the picture and try to shoot 4 short movies in a row. </p>
<p>So he started searching for talented people to join him on the projects and make this 4 short-films come to life. We all get-together and we started the pre-production on Zombie. </p>
<p>Let's face it, we needed money, mainly in a city like London that literally asks you for money to film anywhere. So the director went in touch with a friend from Portugal, with a recently new film company, to help us on the funds to pay for expenses for the team and locations. We did manage to get around 1000£ to make Zombie. We prepared everything, we had casting sessions with kids, we had rehearsals with the kids picked by the Director. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494175145/fns8lrbkfwbaynhuxdoq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And next week we would be shooting. We figured out how to handle food, we went to the director's house the previous day of shooting to make sandwiches for the next day shooting. </p>
<p>And on March 24th we were shooting.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494175363/kquvbbz87mfigp0gb9jh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494175382/be0paal8oc5ttau6pttm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>And, two days and 960£ after we finished the shooting of Zombie. You may ask. What were the 960£ for. And because we want, to be honest with you, we've spent around 350£ on traveling for the team, 150£ on food, 240£ on renting the forest (Yes we have to rent forests),  and everything else went to the renting of some tripods for Pilo boards and a Wireless Follow Focus. </p>
<p>And 2 days after shooting Zombie and after giving the Files to the Editor, we started prepping George. We were sure about one thing: ""We need to make George the cheapest possible"". And so we did. The Director decided to shoot the film at his house, the DOP decided to shoot with one of our cameras and LED lights from some crew members. Now for the food, we needed to either cook ourselves or try to take advantage of the theme of George. Since George is all about a Guy trying to eat his hamburger we've decided to contact hamburger shops to see if any of them would support us with hamburgers for Props and to the entire crew. And luckily we found an amazing partnership with KUA 'AINA that gave us all that in exchange for promotion on our facebook and end titles. </p>

<p><strong>Rui Pedro Sousa -  </strong><i>""Hello, my name is Rui Pedro Sousa and I am the crazy person who started all this. I was born in Portugal. My career started 6 years ago when I made my first short film ""Tsintty"". I had the passion for filmmaking all my life, but before that, I just didn't had the courage to make a movie. After going to University to study cinema I gathered a group of friends and made Tsintty. That movie went around the world and allowed me to get the ""Rising Star Award"" at the Canada International Film Festival. Two years after, in 2014 I started pre-producing my most challenging film to date, ""Limbo, A Small Measure of Peace"". It took me three years to complete Limbo. Now the film is out at film festivals around the world. Now I am into Zombie, George, Awoken and Whispers. And already have some films in the shelve to make.""</i></p>

<p><strong>Ewa Habdas - </strong><i>"" I always wanted to make movies. In 2008 I started collaborating on short movies as a still photographer: 'Blister', 'Elegance and Romance', 'The Courier', 'Persona'. This made me want to be closer to the production of the movie even more. In 2010 I found myself working as a head of the production of independent movie '</i><i>Hichestan'</i><i>. It was a great </i><i>eye-opener</i><i> for </i><i>me,</i><i> because I understood that I am pretty good </i><i>at</i><i> </i><i>organising projects and putting things together. After, I decided to produce my first short film: '<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2HMzYJYhoI&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Mime is a Terrible Thing to Waste</a>' </i>. <i>T</i><i>his film was not only amazing adventure but also a great learning experience. A film was shown at the few festivals. Year later, Kirill Proskura and I produced: '<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug6zkHlAi9E&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Shadow of Dara' </a></i><i>, which was shown on over 50 different festivals, was nominated for 39 awards and won 19 awards which include</i><i> </i><i>the best film </i>at <i>Top Indie Film Awards or Worldfest Houston Film Festival.

<p><b>Maria Cano - </b><i> <i>"" </i></i><i>Hello, my name is Maria Cano and I am the producer of this crazy adventure. I was born in Spain and I came to London eight months ago. All my life I liked projects related to the audiovisual world because since I was young I picked up my father's camera and I started taking pictures like crazy. So I decided to study Visual Arts. After having experience as a producer in some projects at the University (Yours, 2015) and outside of it (Circle, 2016), I decided that what I liked most was organizing and carrying out audiovisual projects. Now I am into Zombie, George, Awoken and Whispers.

<p>And this is how we shot Zombie and George, The dream is to film two more films Awoken and Whisper and they are far more ambitious than two previous ones.</p>
<p>But, Whispers and Awoken will, indeed, need a lot of budget. For Whispers we need to rent a two Floors House, fill it with boxes, blank sheets, paint cans (The family front the story is just moving into a new house), and we need to rent a Ronin (Stablizer to keep the camera steady) - <strong> Did we already told you the Director is going to shoot Whispers only in ONE SEQUENCE SHOT? </strong></p>
<p>As for Awoken, the only way to make it right is to build a Kid's Bedroom set (Where the entire movie happens)  from scratch.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494429122/br2pad0dczypklkj8di2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Set Sketch</strong></p>
<p>The Director has some crazy shots in mind like a 360º around the camera, that is against the wall. When the camera goes behind the bed we will have a removable wall to take out so the camera can pass through. To accomplish all this we need to buy a lot of wood to build the walls, we need to buy wallpaper to dress the walls, we need to get furniture to make it a kids room (We are trying to ask Disney for permission to use a Toy Story Decoration: Toy Story Blanket for the bed, Toy Story toys on the shelves), we need to rent cinema lights (Fresnel Lights) to light the set, we need to rent a Ronin again, and, the director decided to set the film on Christmas Day so we will lights the scene as if the only source of light comes from the Christmas Light on the outside of the bedroom window (Our DOP is very much excited with all this). </p>
<p>We will also have to build a small corridor for a shot that will be an homage to one of the Director's favorite film and Director - A.I. Artificial Intelligence by Steven Spielberg.</p>

We've already started with Zombie (Horror) and George (Comedy). We've already shot it and it is now in post-production. We still have two to go. 
But First, let us tell you about the stories.
(Drama/Horror)

""Zombie tells the story of two Brothers walking through the forest towards their friend’s home.Suddenly they are stopped by the discovery of a dead body. ""
Zombie shows us that every action has it consequence and warns us to be careful when playing dangerous games.
(Comedy)


""All George wanted was to get home and eat his Hamburger without any interruption.""

GEORGE JAMES, a middle-aged eviction specialist, is hungry after a long day at the office. Like many of us, he doesn't like what he's doing but he just needs to survive another day. George is a satire that shows how far you are willing to go just to feel good about yourself.
 (Horror)

""It's Christmas Night. Michael is sleeping in his bed. Suddenly a HUGE MAN enters his room carrying his dead parent's bodies. ""
Awoken is an adaptation of a campfire story which you often hear when you are a child. At its core, it's a story about how often you take things for granted and how often you judge a book by it's cover. 
(Horror)

""A young woman arrives at his new home to realize she isn't alone at all. ""
Whispers is an adaptation of a campfire story which you often hear when you are a child. At its core is all about how you face your own fears. 
Well, we could tell you more... but then we would be spoiling the whole experience for you. 


Back in September 2016, Director Rui Pedro Sousa came to London with the goal of pursuing his career. Upon arriving, the Scripts of Zombie and George came into Rui's life and he decided to join his scripts Whispers and Awoken to the picture and try to shoot 4 short movies in a row. 
So he started searching for talented people to join him on the projects and make this 4 short-films come to life. We all get-together and we started the pre-production on Zombie. 
Let's face it, we needed money, mainly in a city like London that literally asks you for money to film anywhere. So the director went in touch with a friend from Portugal, with a recently new film company, to help us on the funds to pay for expenses for the team and locations. We did manage to get around 1000£ to make Zombie. We prepared everything, we had casting sessions with kids, we had rehearsals with the kids picked by the Director. 

And next week we would be shooting. We figured out how to handle food, we went to the director's house the previous day of shooting to make sandwiches for the next day shooting. 
And on March 24th we were shooting.

ZOMBIE - STILL FRAME
And, two days and 960£ after we finished the shooting of Zombie. You may ask. What were the 960£ for. And because we want, to be honest with you, we've spent around 350£ on traveling for the team, 150£ on food, 240£ on renting the forest (Yes we have to rent forests),  and everything else went to the renting of some tripods for Pilo boards and a Wireless Follow Focus. 
And 2 days after shooting Zombie and after giving the Files to the Editor, we started prepping George. We were sure about one thing: ""We need to make George the cheapest possible"". And so we did. The Director decided to shoot the film at his house, the DOP decided to shoot with one of our cameras and LED lights from some crew members. Now for the food, we needed to either cook ourselves or try to take advantage of the theme of George. Since George is all about a Guy trying to eat his hamburger we've decided to contact hamburger shops to see if any of them would support us with hamburgers for Props and to the entire crew. And luckily we found an amazing partnership with KUA 'AINA that gave us all that in exchange for promotion on our facebook and end titles. 
Thank You KUA 'AINA
And you know what? We were able to cast talented, funny, out of this world actors to be part of George.

Alexander Perkins - Alexander is an amazing actor who has worked in all the season of The Office with Ricky Gervais, and also great shows like Law & Order Uk and Call the Midwife.

Adam Shaw - Adam is another amazing actor that has already worked with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks on Saving Private Ryan and in many movies more like RED2.
We had an amazing cast and the shooting day came.

And here we are on the lunch break eating the hamburgers from Kua 'Aina :)

GEORGE - Still Frame
And this is it. 
With Love, Passion, Persistence we manage to shoot Zombie and George. 
The hardest are yet to come, and this is where we need you to come in. 


But first things up. Please let us present ourselves to you. 

Rui Pedro Sousa -  ""Hello, my name is Rui Pedro Sousa and I am the crazy person who started all this. I was born in Portugal. My career started 6 years ago when I made my first short film ""Tsintty"". I had the passion for filmmaking all my life, but before that, I just didn't had the courage to make a movie. After going to University to study cinema I gathered a group of friends and made Tsintty. That movie went around the world and allowed me to get the ""Rising Star Award"" at the Canada International Film Festival. Two years after, in 2014 I started pre-producing my most challenging film to date, ""Limbo, A Small Measure of Peace"". It took me three years to complete Limbo. Now the film is out at film festivals around the world. Now I am into Zombie, George, Awoken and Whispers. And already have some films in the shelve to make.""
Director's Reel

Ewa Habdas - "" I always wanted to make movies. In 2008 I started collaborating on short movies as a still photographer: 'Blister', 'Elegance and Romance', 'The Courier', 'Persona'. This made me want to be closer to the production of the movie even more. In 2010 I found myself working as a head of the production of independent movie 'Hichestan'. It was a great eye-opener for me, because I understood that I am pretty good at organising projects and putting things together. After, I decided to produce my first short film: 'A Mime is a Terrible Thing to Waste' . This film was not only amazing adventure but also a great learning experience. A film was shown at the few festivals. Year later, Kirill Proskura and I produced: 'A Shadow of Dara' , which was shown on over 50 different festivals, was nominated for 39 awards and won 19 awards which include the best film at Top Indie Film Awards or Worldfest Houston Film Festival. In 2016, I produced short experimental film: 'Looking for Love'. Currently, I have joined the team of Rui Pedro Sousa and have been working on his four movies. Privately, I am a dreamer, philosopher, photographer (Ewa Habdas Photography) and idealist, person who loves deep conversations and always wants to grow. 

Maria Cano -  "" Hello, my name is Maria Cano and I am the producer of this crazy adventure. I was born in Spain and I came to London eight months ago. All my life I liked projects related to the audiovisual world because since I was young I picked up my father's camera and I started taking pictures like crazy. So I decided to study Visual Arts. After having experience as a producer in some projects at the University (Yours, 2015) and outside of it (Circle, 2016), I decided that what I liked most was organizing and carrying out audiovisual projects. Now I am into Zombie, George, Awoken and Whispers. Please take a look at my webpage! http://mariacano7.wixsite.com/miportfolio ""
Please do check the rest of the team under the TEAM section. 


And this is how we shot Zombie and George, The dream is to film two more films Awoken and Whisper and they are far more ambitious than two previous ones.
But, Whispers and Awoken will, indeed, need a lot of budget. For Whispers we need to rent a two Floors House, fill it with boxes, blank sheets, paint cans (The family front the story is just moving into a new house), and we need to rent a Ronin (Stablizer to keep the camera steady) -  Did we already told you the Director is going to shoot Whispers only in ONE SEQUENCE SHOT? 
As for Awoken, the only way to make it right is to build a Kid's Bedroom set (Where the entire movie happens)  from scratch.
Set Sketch
The Director has some crazy shots in mind like a 360º around the camera, that is against the wall. When the camera goes behind the bed we will have a removable wall to take out so the camera can pass through. To accomplish all this we need to buy a lot of wood to build the walls, we need to buy wallpaper to dress the walls, we need to get furniture to make it a kids room (We are trying to ask Disney for permission to use a Toy Story Decoration: Toy Story Blanket for the bed, Toy Story toys on the shelves), we need to rent cinema lights (Fresnel Lights) to light the set, we need to rent a Ronin again, and, the director decided to set the film on Christmas Day so we will lights the scene as if the only source of light comes from the Christmas Light on the outside of the bedroom window (Our DOP is very much excited with all this). 
We will also have to build a small corridor for a shot that will be an homage to one of the Director's favorite film and Director - A.I. Artificial Intelligence by Steven Spielberg.
Artificial Intelligence Original Shot
Our Shot Sketch 
We are also doing the design of a Monster for one of the films (We won't tell you what film so we won't spoil you). 
Of course, both movies still have the costs regarding transportation, light equipment renting, food and Post-Production.

<h3>Why should you get into bed with us?</h3>
<p>My name is Nyle Cavazos Garcia, the writer, director and producer of THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN.  Independent filmmaking to me is storytelling outside of the box, taking risks and attempting to do something, either on film or in your story, that you couldn't do under the thumb of a mainstream moviemaking machine.  THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN pulls down the sheets from a traditional Romantic Comedy to reveal the even more hilarious, vulnerable and extremely naked truth below.  This movie is part throwback to raunchy 80's sex comedies, part reconstruction of what a Romantic Comedy is to the modern day moviegoing public, and part flash forward to an uncensored and truthful view of how awkward, messy and all-encompassing casual sex is on a person's journey to finding love and happiness.</p>
<p>We are a small army in this fight to bring THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN into the world, and wholeheartedly appreciate all of your support and contributions.  The lead actor Cassidy Durrell, and I have invested all we can out-of-pocket to get this movie going.  I own some film equipment through my production company, Small Town Pictures, and we have more equipment being donated, including HD cameras and lenses.  Most of our film locations are also being donated.  Our tight but experienced crew, and our truly amazing cast is working for a very small day rate (or deferred pay).  The term project-of-passion is thrown around quite a bit in Hollywood, and is usually referring to a ""low budget"" $30-million dollar ""independent film"" starring Matthew McConaughey or Channing Tatum.  In our case, this actually is a project-of-passion, and our production budget is only $30-thousand dollars.</p>

</div></div>","Why should you get into bed with us?
My name is Nyle Cavazos Garcia, the writer, director and producer of THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN.  Independent filmmaking to me is storytelling outside of the box, taking risks and attempting to do something, either on film or in your story, that you couldn't do under the thumb of a mainstream moviemaking machine.  THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN pulls down the sheets from a traditional Romantic Comedy to reveal the even more hilarious, vulnerable and extremely naked truth below.  This movie is part throwback to raunchy 80's sex comedies, part reconstruction of what a Romantic Comedy is to the modern day moviegoing public, and part flash forward to an uncensored and truthful view of how awkward, messy and all-encompassing casual sex is on a person's journey to finding love and happiness.
We are a small army in this fight to bring THE MAN WHO LOVED WOMEN into the world, and wholeheartedly appreciate all of your support and contributions.  The lead actor Cassidy Durrell, and I have invested all we can out-of-pocket to get this movie going.  I own some film equipment through my production company, Small Town Pictures, and we have more equipment being donated, including HD cameras and lenses.  Most of our film locations are also being donated.  Our tight but experienced crew, and our truly amazing cast is working for a very small day rate (or deferred pay).  The term project-of-passion is thrown around quite a bit in Hollywood, and is usually referring to a ""low budget"" $30-million dollar ""independent film"" starring Matthew McConaughey or Channing Tatum.  In our case, this actually is a project-of-passion, and our production budget is only $30-thousand dollars.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, and thank you for checking out our film project! We're very excited to have you join this Float Trip horror adventure with us--it has been in development for the past year and will be <strong>filming July 24th - August 3rd</strong>!</p>
<p>We are James Tweedie and Jed Ramsey--we love good stories and have fun sharing them with others. We have been involved in multiple facets of the film industry for many years--in acting, writing and producing. After James was Ben Affleck's stand-in for the entire filming of <i>Gone Girl  </i>(but that was Ben's butt, not James's), he met Jed through <a href=""http://www.creativeactorsworkshop.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creative Actors Workshop</a> in St. Louis, MO, and began developing, writing and pre-production for this tale that takes place on the Huzzah River in Steelville, Missouri. As producers of this new project, James brings his experience producing and directing <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0731TW4P2/ref=cm_sw_r_fa_dp_eWDtzbN558EVZ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The Awakening</i></a>, and Jed carries over his roles as associate producer from <a href=""https://vimeo.com/145398600"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Sophie</i></a> and <a href=""https://youtu.be/HO7GTlorTfY"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>On Sight</i></a>.</p>

<p>With your help, this film will be made at a Hollywood level and shared with you, your family and friends, and millions of people!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This project has been funded to $35,000 through our own pockets and the generosity of friends and family...but we are a little short and need $5,000 to round out the budget for:</p>
<ul>
<li>FOOD. With 18 people filming 8-12 hour days for 11 days...we gots to eat!</li>
<li>Equipment insurance. We have to get insurance for the $50,000 worth of film equipment we are using.</li>
<li>Plenty of WATER and SUNSCREEN lotion for cast and crew--it's the hottest time of the summer!</li>
<li>A deposit for one filming location which we will use for 1 day.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a bunch of cool perks below for those of you who'd like to contribute financially, including a kayak (yes, we said <i>kayak</i>), film props and autographed posters, and even Producer credit with the opportunity to get a percentage of the profits should Float Trip make money.</p>
<p>Even if we don't make our campaign funding goal of 5k, all funds raised will go directly towards our needs listed above. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you've ever wanted to be involved in the production of a movie, this is your chance. You're teaming up with actors, filmmakers, and producers who have worked or performed on professional film sets.</p>
<p>Any amount you can contribute will add to the success of this film--and when it's shared with an audience, you'll know you were a critical factor for that to happen. And if you want your name as a Producer in the credits, you'll have the chance of possibly making a return for your financial contribution, </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While independent films often get made, very few make any financial gain. Often in these cases, a film may be beautiful to watch but has a limited audience due to a lack of ""star"" talent attached, or not enough marketing.</p>
<p>Not only will Float Trip look amazing and have high production value with Julius Damenz as the cinematographer, as well as other professional crew and cast, with Carter Reynolds attached as our star, we have a built-in audience. Carter had a huge following on the online video platform, Vine, followed by YouTube, and has almost 3M active followers on Twitter and 3.4M on Instagram, thousands of whom retweet, repost and comment on each of his posts. This is our audience, and Mr. Reynold's has agreed to actively promote the Float Trip film once released.</p>
<p>While we will seek to sell Float Trip outright, with this large of an audience, we are confident this film will be financially viable through online release as well, either through paid downloads or ad revenue.</p>

This is our second campaign for Curvy Girls Rock. Check out our first campaign here. 

Curvy Girls Rock (CGR), written by Shakesha Williams, was created with the idea that real women should be represented on television. The female leads of CGR are strong, independent, funny and ambitious women. They represent the majority of women around the country. CGR will allow women to see themselves onscreen. 


The Impact

The success of Curvy Girls Rock The Series will: 
Show Hollywood that it's time to cast size diversity in leading roles more often. 
Allow the creators of CGR to create the show with it's intended vision
Make it clear to the industry that plus size women are the majority, not the minority and can be sexy, desirable, proud, ambitious and intriguing.

My family and I planned to celebrate my grandfather’s 80th birthday with him in the Chinese countryside. He passed away very suddenly, shortly before the celebration. I never got the chance to say goodbye to him. Kintsugi is a tribute to my grandfather.

She runs off into a forgotten room in the house and stumbles into a magical world of small creatures. One creature is seemingly hostile at first, but ends up instead in need of Siyue’s help.

<h3>Zee Monsta is Just Another Anti-Christ</h3>
<p>Hello, I am Michelle Nessk of Gloomy Sunday Productions and host of the annual Crypticon Seattle showcase Horrors of the PNW. I am an independent filmmaker based out of the Pacific North West. </p>
<p>Zee Monsta is a character I created as a child when I would horror host for my uncle and his friends when we'd watch scary movies. Zee has since evolved into a profession, where she makes appearances on Horrors of the PNW, as well as other shows including the official Bleedingham Horror Film Festival promotional shorts.</p>
<p>Thus far, all of Zee Monsta's shorts have won awards, and we've gotten to work with various incredible artists such as My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult aka TKK, Syztem7, Huh-Uh, among others.</p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will enable us to make the next segment in the series.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goals are Perky</h3>
<ul>
<li>With most of the expenses covered, we are seeking $1,000 to finish funding for this project. This will cover costs for product to create the practical special effects, and feeding our crew during the duration of filming. Catering will be provided via; Foods by Hungry Guy.</li>
<li>We will be holding some special features for our perks, not excluding a chance to own one of the sfx props from the film. Real fake guts, in your hand! As well as an option to be murdered by Zee Monsta in a bumper featured in Horrors of the PNW for 2018.</li>
<li>If we don't hit our goal, the funds will still be utilized for the film's sfx, but it won't likely be as gory. If we go over our goal, we will take the gore as over the top as we possibly can.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>We Want Your Participation</h3>
<p>Indie horror films happen with the support of the horror community:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to gross you out with as much grotesque imagery as we can fit into six minutes without sacrificing narrative.</li>
<li>We always finish what we start.</li>
<li>Everyone involved is living their dream of creating a film to be proud of.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges? There are none.</h3>
<p>This film is happening even if we only hit zero funding. Your contribution will help us accomplish the imagery without compromise but, being indie filmmakers, we are flexible creatures.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have completed award winning films on zero budget.</li>
<li>Our skills only improve with each new film.</li>
<li>Your contribution helps us bring a more elaborate sense of imagery to the screen.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>It's okay if you cannot contribute financially</h3>
<p>We know that not everyone can financially contribute, but that doesn't mean you're no longer special to us. We still love you, and we are always grateful for the support of link sharing.</p>

With most of the expenses covered, we are seeking $1,000 to finish funding for this project. This will cover costs for product to create the practical special effects, and feeding our crew during the duration of filming. Catering will be provided via; Foods by Hungry Guy.
We will be holding some special features for our perks, not excluding a chance to own one of the sfx props from the film. Real fake guts, in your hand! As well as an option to be murdered by Zee Monsta in a bumper featured in Horrors of the PNW for 2018.
If we don't hit our goal, the funds will still be utilized for the film's sfx, but it won't likely be as gory. If we go over our goal, we will take the gore as over the top as we possibly can.


We Want Your Participation
Indie horror films happen with the support of the horror community:

We want to gross you out with as much grotesque imagery as we can fit into six minutes without sacrificing narrative.
We always finish what we start.
Everyone involved is living their dream of creating a film to be proud of.


Risks & Challenges? There are none.
This film is happening even if we only hit zero funding. Your contribution will help us accomplish the imagery without compromise but, being indie filmmakers, we are flexible creatures.

We have completed award winning films on zero budget.
Our skills only improve with each new film.
Your contribution helps us bring a more elaborate sense of imagery to the screen.


It's okay if you cannot contribute financially
We know that not everyone can financially contribute, but that doesn't mean you're no longer special to us. We still love you, and we are always grateful for the support of link sharing.",2.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Let's Start a Cult</h3>
<p>""Let's Start a Cult"" is a dark comedy following The Cell Commune and its influence on the community as it grows. From its humble inception, stemming from adolescent ambition running amok in a dingy basement, all the way to the final moments, one should expect to be immersed in a world of provocation, debauchery, and of course...the Absurd! </p>
<h3>A word from the Director</h3>
<p>With this film, I hope to develop my filmmaking skills all while making as many people laugh as possible. I also would hope this film inspires it's viewers, not to start a cult, but to pick up any camera they can get their hands on, get their friends together, make a movie, and have a great time doing it!</p>
<p>For a young filmmaker, I believe there is nothing more important than to actively and actually make movies and that's exactly what I'm trying to do. For the first half of 2017 I have been planning, writing, and filming for ""Let's Start a Cult"". I have great friends helping me with this project, some with tremendous amounts of experience and some with none, all creating together in the same space learning new things about the filmmaking process and working to make the best movie possible. The feeling of being on set and working with all of these amazing people is unmatched by anything I've experienced before, no matter how stressful or grueling a set may be at times, I find myself always coming back to it wanting to learn more and become better than I was before. </p>

<h3>Doing what you love and loving what you do...</h3>
<p>Are you doing what you love? Or loving what you do? Or are you in at a place where neither statement is true? I'm going to be 53 years old in December and I'm looking to finally do both. I have a full-time job. It's great with a great company, but my passion is filmmaking. For the better part of the past 5 years, I've been engaged in visual storytelling. It didn't come in the sense of an education or career goal but more so as an avenue that I could release these ideas from my mind to those around me. Filmmaking in essence was the pressure valve that if opened, would allow a flow of ideas to stream freely which in return cleared space to form new creations. You can go to my YouTube channel and see all that I've been a part of. These videos were the building blocks of my craft that have elevated me to the point that I am at today. Still a grasshopper, but nonetheless, a predator looking for his next delicious meal - AND THIS IS IT!</p>

<h3>""Will work for IMDb Credits."" - Starving Artist</h3>
<p>Five years ago, I decided to take my writing skills, ideas, and stories to the screen! Boy, I didn't know what I was getting into at the time. With a handful of close friends, we started making content. With each video that we made, we gained a vast amount of knowledge which we applied to each project that was to come next. Learning and growing, we continued to march forward falling in love with the craft of visual storytelling. One of our biggest accomplishments was giving people a chance to be in front and behind the camera. Bringing the community together, we gave those hungry to be part of something a chance. Everyone donated their sweat, time, and effort. They did get fed and IMDB credits, but no money. Now, we come to this project. </p>
<p>Artists are always expected to do what they do for free. Hey, it's art, and you love it. Of course you will do it for free. I want to change that. I want to be able to give back to the community. Pay the actors, crew, editors, composer, locations, and everything that goes into making a film. </p>
<p>Your contribution will not only help me bring my first feature film to life, but also give back to those artists. You can help all those involved in this project make a part of their dream come true. For me, I really want to be able to continue to make films, give back to the community, make a living full time (someday), and tell important stories. Hollywood has some great movies, actors, directors, and crew out there but Hollywood has also made it hard for that little person to get into the industry. I've never asked anyone to help me fund my film projects. My credit card balance can prove that. <strong><i>HAHAHAHA.</i></strong> I hope you will take the time to invest in this project. Just think for $3 you can say you helped dozens of people make their dreams become a reality. Thank you for taking the time to read this. </p>

<p><strong>Neil Lee Griffin</strong></p>
<p><i>Composer</i></p>
<p>Born and raised in Upstate SC, growing up with a stutter wasn't easy. From the teasing in school to struggling to say my own name. As a child I was always fond of music, growing up with a piano and guitar near by, it was never out of reach. In my mid teens I decided that music was something I wanted to learn more about, so I set out to take piano lessons, and did so for a few years. Using the knowledge I gained from piano lessons I taught myself to play guitar. I have always loved movie scores and theme songs from TV, the way you can set up a scenario or convey an emotion in a story without saying a word really resonated with me. Wanting to do more with my music I started incorporating more score and storytelling elements in my writing. </p>

<h3>So... Here's what we need and here's what you'll get. </h3>
</div><div>
<p>The reality is we really need <strong>$50,000</strong> to be comfortable in paying everyone on set. I didn't list that because I felt that was asking a lot of people. With <strong>$25,000</strong> we can pay people but at a much smaller rate. That's still great - <i>and allows us to achieve a goal of rewarding those who are putting in the time and effort for our common vision of Mister Academy. </i>We set the <strong>$15,000</strong> goal as the minimum to get this film done. With that we will be able to <strong>feed</strong>, <strong>pay</strong>, and <strong>purchase necessary items to increase our production value</strong> (<i>set design, props, wardrobe, etc.</i>) If we are to exceed our goal the funds will go toward <strong>post-production</strong> and <strong>marketing</strong> which plays an even bigger factor in ensuring this film gets the right distribution.</p>
<p>We've got some really cool perks too! The $3 perk gets you a condom. Why? Well, if you watch the trailer, you will know. It's got ""The Lady's Place"" written on it which is a school for women in the film. I think one of the coolest perks is having a character named after you. That's cool. Oh and there's t-shirts, hats, posters, copies of the film. Tickets to the premier and other really cool perks. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://imgur.com/PHU0uqc"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/PHU0uqc.gif"" src="""" style="""" title=""source: imgur.com""/></a>  </p>
<p>I really like the perk that gets your photo in the film credits. So, not only does your name appear in the credits but your face does too!</p>
<p><strong>Now, what happens if we don't hit our target? Well, it's simple.</strong></p>
<p>We will make this film, even if we don't hit our target. It may take longer and it will be done on weekends over the course of a few months. The biggest problem with this is losing momentum and energy. I will have to find people that are willing to work for food, IMDb credits, and fun. </p>
<p><i>This story must be told. We are at a time in our society where everyone needs to have a reason to laugh more. </i></p>
<p>There are too many people out there that need my help. And yours. They need an outlet for their creative gifts. There aren't a lot of people in Greenville, SC that provide that opportunity. I have several local indie filmmakers that do the same thing. We all help each other out. We give our time and effort in exchange for the same on each other's projects. </p>
<p>Money is tight. So many people recently lost everything from Hurricane Harvey and Irma. I have friends and family that lost EVERYTHING. They have nothing left. So, I understand, if you can't contribute to my campaign - It's OK. It really is. If you can't, <strong>please share my campaign with your friends and family.</strong> Spread the word. If<i> 5,000</i> people give <i>$3 </i>we will hit our goal. I know that sounds like a lot but I bet if you added up all the friends your friend have on Facebook and other social media sites it easily <i>100,000 connections</i>. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this campaign. I hope I get to see your name in the credits! Like and share away!</p>

Behind The Camera

Neil Lee Griffin
Composer
Born and raised in Upstate SC, growing up with a stutter wasn't easy. From the teasing in school to struggling to say my own name. As a child I was always fond of music, growing up with a piano and guitar near by, it was never out of reach. In my mid teens I decided that music was something I wanted to learn more about, so I set out to take piano lessons, and did so for a few years. Using the knowledge I gained from piano lessons I taught myself to play guitar. I have always loved movie scores and theme songs from TV, the way you can set up a scenario or convey an emotion in a story without saying a word really resonated with me. Wanting to do more with my music I started incorporating more score and storytelling elements in my writing.

So... Here's what we need and here's what you'll get. 

The reality is we really need $50,000 to be comfortable in paying everyone on set. I didn't list that because I felt that was asking a lot of people. With $25,000 we can pay people but at a much smaller rate. That's still great - and allows us to achieve a goal of rewarding those who are putting in the time and effort for our common vision of Mister Academy. We set the $15,000 goal as the minimum to get this film done. With that we will be able to feed, pay, and purchase necessary items to increase our production value (set design, props, wardrobe, etc.) If we are to exceed our goal the funds will go toward post-production and marketing which plays an even bigger factor in ensuring this film gets the right distribution.
We've got some really cool perks too! The $3 perk gets you a condom. Why? Well, if you watch the trailer, you will know. It's got ""The Lady's Place"" written on it which is a school for women in the film. I think one of the coolest perks is having a character named after you. That's cool. Oh and there's t-shirts, hats, posters, copies of the film. Tickets to the premier and other really cool perks. 
  
I really like the perk that gets your photo in the film credits. So, not only does your name appear in the credits but your face does too!
Now, what happens if we don't hit our target? Well, it's simple.
We will make this film, even if we don't hit our target. It may take longer and it will be done on weekends over the course of a few months. The biggest problem with this is losing momentum and energy. I will have to find people that are willing to work for food, IMDb credits, and fun. 
This story must be told. We are at a time in our society where everyone needs to have a reason to laugh more. 
There are too many people out there that need my help. And yours. They need an outlet for their creative gifts. There aren't a lot of people in Greenville, SC that provide that opportunity. I have several local indie filmmakers that do the same thing. We all help each other out. We give our time and effort in exchange for the same on each other's projects. 
Money is tight. So many people recently lost everything from Hurricane Harvey and Irma. I have friends and family that lost EVERYTHING. They have nothing left. So, I understand, if you can't contribute to my campaign - It's OK. It really is. If you can't, please share my campaign with your friends and family. Spread the word. If 5,000 people give $3 we will hit our goal. I know that sounds like a lot but I bet if you added up all the friends your friend have on Facebook and other social media sites it easily 100,000 connections. 
Thank you for taking the time to read this campaign. I hope I get to see your name in the credits! Like and share away!",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Story</h2>
<p>Behind Blue Eyes is a short dark fantasy film following a little girl named Gabrielle. Gabrielle wakes up in a barren and ghostly forest, unlike any forest on earth. </p>
<p>   Upon waking she finds herself being hunted by a faceless ghoul known as the Gaunt. Quick to action, Gabrielle runs away and seeks refuge in an abandoned greenhouse. There she meets a monstrous-looking man named Gisher. </p>
<p>   He tells her that her only hope of escaping this land is by completing three tasks. He warns her that the tasks are dangerous and she will likely fail. Gabrielle decides to take on Gisher’s challenge and the two embark on a perilous quest.</p>
<p>  Behind Blue Eyes is a film that deals with themes of self-discovery and finding the truth in the darkness, even if it is a frightening one. We are making a film that will both entertain and test the audience.</p>

Whether it is the <strong>Xenomorph</strong> from <strong>Alien</strong>, <strong>Freddy Kruger</strong>, <strong>Jason</strong>, <strong>ET</strong>, <strong>The Faun</strong>, <strong>Darth Vader</strong>, <strong>The Joker</strong>, etc. They all have a unique set of traits, we find ourselves getting attached to them and sometimes even rooting for them. </p><p>   That's our goal for one of our main characters: <strong>Gisher</strong>.</p><p>   We want people to create an unusual relationship with him, to remember him, and to connect with him.

Behind Blue Eyes is a short dark fantasy film following a little girl named Gabrielle. Gabrielle wakes up in a barren and ghostly forest, unlike any forest on earth. 
   Upon waking she finds herself being hunted by a faceless ghoul known as the Gaunt. Quick to action, Gabrielle runs away and seeks refuge in an abandoned greenhouse. There she meets a monstrous-looking man named Gisher. 
   He tells her that her only hope of escaping this land is by completing three tasks. He warns her that the tasks are dangerous and she will likely fail. Gabrielle decides to take on Gisher’s challenge and the two embark on a perilous quest.
  Behind Blue Eyes is a film that deals with themes of self-discovery and finding the truth in the darkness, even if it is a frightening one. We are making a film that will both entertain and test the audience.
The CastKyra Johnson as Gabrielle    Kyra is 9-years-old and lives in Central Florida. She has been acting, singing, and dancing for family and friends since she could walk!   Kyra's on-camera work includes two short films (including the lead role in the horror short ""The Man in the Mask""), a commercial, and a children's web series.   In addition to on-camera work, she has been in numerous theater performances over the last three years; her current role as Belle in ""Beauty and the Beast"".​  As part of the Magic Curtain Productions performance troupe, she received special recognition as Timon in the troupe's award-winning performance of ""Lion King - The Musical"" at the 2017 Disney National Performing Arts Festival, where she also received a superior rating for her solo vocal performance.   Kyra is addicted to the ABC show ""Once Upon a Time."" She went to the 2017 official convention in Vancouver, where she met many of the stars, toured the sets, and loved spending time with her fellow Oncers!David McMahon as Gisher  Two-time Florida Rising Star recipient and 2016 Tampa Bay Actor of the Year, David McMahon has acted in over 50 short films and several features, including a gripping, 0.7-second scene bolting from falling sharks in “Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!” Perhaps best known for his Funny or Die musical short, “Gynecologist: The Musical"", David shares an equal passion for both comedy and drama, and has been recognized and awarded for his work in both genres.    David is currently filming the feature-length dramas, “Misty Blue Lane” and “NS404: Provenance.” Horror fans will soon see him as Father Powell alongside scream-queen Jessica Cameron in “The Song of Solomon.”   When not filming, David works full-time as an advertising writer and resides in St. Augustine, FL with his film-widow wife, Betsy, and “fur kids” Max and Rufus.Designing a Dark Fantasy World  Creating a unique world that is both frightening yet mesmerizing is difficult. But it's all for the right reasons. We took inspiration from author H.P. Lovecraft and from visionary director Guillermo Del Toro to create this beautiful nightmare.    Our biggest challenge was creating the world that not only looks corrupted and surreal but that it shows that it used to be a place of great beauty and splendor.    We want to be able to tell a story with everything that you see, whether it is the character, creatures, props or set design.    Our biggest inspiration was Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, we wanted to create something that looks strange, scary, dark yet beautiful.   Concept artist Tomislav Jagnjic not only understood this concept but he also put his own unique twist to it.Initial Concept ArtPerspective of Corrupted LandInitial Concept Designs for Gisher's HouseConcept Design of Gisher's HouseCreation and Designs of Creatures  This is probably the most challenging part of the film. Creating unique creatures. The filmmakers were determined to not only create them from the ground up but for the creatures to be able to have a story of their own.    When the Gaunts first appear, we want the audience to feel their omnipotent presence versus Gisher who elicits a reaction of horrifying fear of disgust. We want everyone to remember these characters and appreciate not only the way they look but their overall characterizations as well. These are characters that have lived in this hellish landscape for years and are but a shell of what they once were.    Fortunately, we had two of the most talented concept artists working today: Tomislav Jagnjić and Srdjan Pavlovic. They both worked long hours with the director and writer to make sure we achieve the perfect designs for each creature.   They both faced the challenge of not only making unique creatures but also the challenge designing the creatures to be made practically through special effects make-up.  Gisher  ""Very interesting and complex character to design - outside, Gisher is a horribly disfigured monster, inside he is still a human - capturing that was the main challenge"" - Srdjan Pavlovic    We all know at least one iconic character from a movie. Whether it is the Xenomorph from Alien, Freddy Kruger, Jason, ET, The Faun, Darth Vader, The Joker, etc. They all have a unique set of traits, we find ourselves getting attached to them and sometimes even rooting for them.    That's our goal for one of our main characters: Gisher.   We want people to create an unusual relationship with him, to remember him, and to connect with him. You might love him or you might hate him but you will definitely remember him.   Everything that he is, has been thought about: the way he moves, the way he speaks, what he likes to eat, his facial expressions, his interactions with Gabrielle, his former life... Everything has been thought of.   Kyle Vest, our make-up artist, has estimated that it will take an approximate time of 4 hours to put the make-up on David. (Surprisingly, David is very excited about that). First Concepts of Gisher by Srdjan Pavlovic3D model for Gisher by Srdjan Pavlovic The Weeping Tree   Before the corruption, The Weeping Tree used to be a place of worship and purity.    Every living thing would come and celebrate life. They would harvest its magical sap that would grant immortality.   Now, coming to this place is asking for death. As the land began to corrupt, The Weeping Tree did as well, thus transforming its worshipers into malevolent creatures called Gaunts.The Weeping Tree by Srdjan PavlovicThe Weeping Tree -  more detailed renders by Srdjan Pavlovic Mud MonsterWeeping Tree's protector and loyal minion and servant, creature of tremendous strength called Mud Monster.   Mud Monster - concept render by Srdjan PavlovicMud Monster - medium shotprofile shotThe Gaunts  The Gaunts are creatures that roam throughout the land. They spend their time looking for something to devour, and they will do anything to get their prey. Their faceless bodies will hunt their prey until they lose their sanity.   Inspired by the nightmarish creatures called Nightgaunts, created by the one and only H.P. Lovecraft, concept artist Tomislav took a very unique yet faithful approach on The Gaunts and came up with an original look and style.   There are four Gaunts in total which our characters will face. In this story, the approach we took with them was more of a mythical one.   Like as mentioned above, we wanted to show the difference between a monster and a creature. All four Gaunts have their own unique personality.   Each of the Gaunts has its own unique method of hunting its prey, and they can taste their victim's deepest emotions.    Initially, there was only going to be one Gaunt but as we started developing the story and going through concepts, the director came up with background stories for each one of them. Their names are Wrath, Pestilence, Death, and Agony.   All of them will be created using special make-up effects. WrathWrath will devour you the moment it sees you. Favorite Flavor: Piquant LustPestilencePestilence follows you and hides within the shadows until he is ready to strike from the shadows.Favorite Flavor: Pungent CowardiceDeathEverything withers when Death is near. Death is the truth that everyone tries to escape from.  Favorite Flavor: Bitter Melancholy.     AgonyAgony feasts on the victims suffering. There is no escape from it. Favorite Flavor: Tender Innocence.  The CrewThe Director   Ismael J Orozco is driven by his ambition, love of storytelling and passion for filmmaking. His goal for every film is to be able to teleport the audience into the world he has created.   From an early age, he has been drawn to the genre of dark fantasy, drama, horror, and sci-fi.

Help us to bring ‘Ital Reign’, and its feature-length successor ‘Shy’ to the big screen!Born out of a desire to commit Birmingham's rich musical history to film, 'Ital Reign and the Story of the Dangerous Dub', beautifully captures the city's long relationship with reggae music. With an original soundtrack that includes contributions from the pioneers of Birmingham's reggae scene, we are on course to kick start a revival for a new generation of reggae lovers.Our success so far can be partly attributed to the need to commit this amazing legacy to film‘ but those invested in our project are equally drawn to the positive message at the heart of this family film and our commitment to authenticity.We are proud to announce a cast and crew that includes some of the West Midland's best known performers.Amlak Tafari - Steel Pulse Bass Guitarist & Yellow Wall ProductionsCherrelle Skeete - BBC's Ordinary Lies & West End's Harry Potter & the cursed childTonia Daley-Campbell - BBC's Danny & the human zoo & LucidCatalyst Studios have designed a unique marketing campaign that will capture imaginations across the city and beyond, through our network of national and international film professionals; Rick Elgood - Director of Jamaica's very own 'Dancehall Queen' & 'One Love' starring Kymani Marley & Cherine Anderson.Partly set on the beautiful island of Jamaica, ‘Ital Reign and the Story of the Dangerous Dub’ will reach thousands, with the intention that our feature film will reach millions.This pilot film will be privately premiered in Birmingham, London & Jamaica to capture the hearts of our investors & the current reggae revival artists such as: Chronixx, Jah 9, Jesse Royal, Protoje, Kabaka Pyramid and many more we would like to feature in the feature film later on in 2018.With your support we can see this project through to completion and premiere in February 2018.THE PROJECT‘Ital Reign’ tells the story of a man who has to choose fame or fatherhood, friends who have to choose loyalty or desire, and a young woman who has to choose to believe in herself.Featuring classic reggae DUB tracks alongside original music, ‘Ital Reign’ begins in 90's Birmingham, following a young reggae band aiming to make it big.

<p>Desert Sai: The story of a killing is an idea I have long been molding and crafting and I believe there is no better chance to attempt to bring this story to life on screen than right now. The crucial element I believe to make this story pulsates with life on screen is down to keeping the audience teased to the point they are eager to know more but not to overfeed audience with exposition that could potentially harm the viewer's experience or make the plot of the story feel rushed. The script along with the environment encourages a natural and believable performance from actors and actresses., Forcing actors such as Zaid and Jesus to reach into their bag of skills and hopefully produce a performance worthwhile, calling on skills like body language, the use of facial expressions and whatever else can be applied. The message of the story is one that asks questions on the true idea of redemption and how far one must go to fully achieve true redemption.<br/> </p>
<p>Contributors to this project will be helping with the overall trip into the heart of the desert, including food for the crew and cast, transportation of not only the crew but equipment, hiring of a qualified and polished stunt coordinator and scoring the overall production.</p>
<p>Supporting the project is not only a reward from you to me but in a very small way also a contribution from us to indie cinema and indie filmmaking.</p>

<p>Getting the actors in the ground and safely(this will be done by literally digging a hole into the ground and faking the look of being buried neck-deep).</p>

<p>Our short film, American Life, tells the story of two brothers growing up in an area riddled with poverty and violence. Michael, our protagonist, wants to be the next Ali. He loves that dream, but he loves his brother Tray more. Every child needs a childhood free of violence. Every kid needs a childhood where they don’t have to worry about the safety of their family in their neighborhood, where they don’t have to resort to violence themselves in order to survive. The City of Chicago remains one of the most segregated and economically unbalanced cities in the US. Compounding this is rampant gang and gun violence which continues to impact youth coming from the city's Western and Southern parts, mainly Black/African &amp; Brown/Latin American Children. This is not an unheard of narrative, but it is one many choose to ignore. Please help us ignite more conversations, and progressive change.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Businessmen is a coming of age story about an eccentric group of 14-year-old skateboarders who call themselves the Businessmen Skate Crew. The plot centers on Andy, struggling with school and full of self doubt, as he attempts his biggest and most dangerous stunt yet. When he fails, it's up to his misfit friends to teach him what it takes to face your fears and overcome even bigger obstacles in life. </p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>This short narrative film project is a large collaboration across many advanced film classes at Columbia College Chicago in Illinois. Most of the crew are students in these classes who have worked their way up to this capstone project. Following the independent filmmaking model, we are tasked with using our own creativity and resources to build this film from the ground up and see it though to the end. </p>

<p>Aaron grew up in Madison, Wisconsin where shooting skate videos and goofy sketches with friends sprouted into a serious passion for filmmaking and telling stories. Aaron pursues directing at Columbia College Chicago, where he'll recieve his BA in Cinema Art &amp; Science this May. His inspiration for Businessmen comes from his skateboarding background, adventures with friends, and films like <i>The Goonies</i>, <i>Stand by Me</i>, and TV show <i>Stranger Things</i>. He's inspired by stories that reach the heart and uncover truths about the human experience, and his love for storytelling and desire to entertain makes him one motivated individual who's incredibly grateful to have the chance to bring <i>Businessmen</i> to life. </p>

<p>Kyle Rudolph was born and raised near Detroit, Michigan.

Building a team and creating something much larger than himself was the mission when taking on the role of producing Businessmen. Kyle still spends his free time recording and producing music. Kyle strongly believes in talent that drives and provokes emotions and his mission is to find that. </p>

<p><strong>Production Design</strong> - $900</p>
<p>The art department is committed to capturing an authentic slice of skateboarding culture from its clothing and music to the actual skateboards and equipment. Additionally, setting the story in 2007 will be a fun way to use props like flip phones and DV tape cameras to add to the warm nostalgia of the film. Production design helps tell the story through props, wardrobe, hair &amp; make-up, and set decoration. </p>
<p><strong>Craft Services</strong> - $800</p>
<p>We have an incredibly hard working cast and crew that we need to keep alive! Shooting for long, 12-hour days will require providing catering and craft to our cast and crew of approximately 40 people. Getting everyone fed will keep us happy, healthy, and energized to get our jobs done on set.</p>
<p><strong>Post Production &amp; Marketing</strong> - $300</p>
<p>Besides hard drives, coloring, sound, music, and promotional artwork, we hope to spread the film to wider audiences! This money will go toward festival fees and be reserved as contingency incase there are unexpected expenses and a cushion for if something goes wrong. </p>
<p><strong>Transportation</strong> - $500</p>
<p>Moving and storing all of the camera and lighting equipment will require a truck rental. We also need to make sure our crew and cast have transportation to our 4 different shooting locations, ensuring everyone makes it safely and efficiently. </p>
<p><strong>Locations</strong> - $500</p>
<p>Some locations require certain fees to let us shoot and use their facilities. Outdoor locations will require generators, tents/shelter incase of bad weather, and a stunt coordinator and on-set medic to ensure the safety and security of our actors, stunt doubles, crew and equipment. </p>
<p><i><strong>TOTAL - </strong>$3000</i></p>
<p>$3000 is the bare minimum we'll need to make this film, and even with that, we'll be very stretched and limited with what we can do. If we are so lucky as to exceed our goal, every extra dollar donated will be put into the production and help us achieve our full vision. </p>

</div></div>","The Story
Businessmen is a coming of age story about an eccentric group of 14-year-old skateboarders who call themselves the Businessmen Skate Crew. The plot centers on Andy, struggling with school and full of self doubt, as he attempts his biggest and most dangerous stunt yet. When he fails, it's up to his misfit friends to teach him what it takes to face your fears and overcome even bigger obstacles in life. 
The Project
This short narrative film project is a large collaboration across many advanced film classes at Columbia College Chicago in Illinois. Most of the crew are students in these classes who have worked their way up to this capstone project. Following the independent filmmaking model, we are tasked with using our own creativity and resources to build this film from the ground up and see it though to the end.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Julianne Neal, director and producer of Karl Mikolka: A Life in Service of the Horse. I have been a follower of Karl's System since the 1990s when I was fortunate enough to participate in a clinic in South Carolina presented by my long-time dressage trainer, Mary Werning. I was able to ride with Karl over the years from time to time and his training methods literally changed the way I rode and viewed dressage. Recently, after producing an equine documentary about Bruce Anderson's work and having great success and opportunities through film festivals and screenings, I was reintroduced to Karl and his work. I truly believe that film is an incredible way to showcase Karl and the importance that his work has, both historically and as the basis for true correct training for the horse. After speaking with Karl about this project and spending some time filming introductory interviews and several short training segments in a clinic setting, we came away in November with a plan to create a short introductory film and trailer for a longer piece. Over the next year, we will work toward gathering the footage for a 60 minute documentary that would delve into his history and the basics of how the System affects both horse and rider, and hopefully in the future to continue with a series of training films based on the exercises in the System.</p>
<p>After several months of work, a short ""reality tv"" style film (30 minute) introducing Karl through the eyes of Mary and one of her current students participating in the clinic is complete, as well as a 3 minute trailer for the longer doc. Now, it is time to gather the footage of training sessions specifically for the film and to speak more in depth with Karl about his amazing life.</p>
<p>I am so excited to bring the incredible story of Karl Mikolka to you. Your donations will make it possible to finish filming during several upcoming clinics, gather interview footage, purchase the necessary music and vintage footage rights and begin post production on the documentary, as well as to enter the initial short piece and trailer into the EQUUS Film Festival and other appropriate screening venues. Karl has been an influential trainer and rider for 67 years and deserves to have a great amount of recognition for that; but perhaps even more importantly, serious dressage riders and their horses deserve to have access to his complete System of classical training. We hope that this documentary, along with his other promotional materials, will help to spread that information with a  wider audience.</p>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We need $10,000 to make this project happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel and expenses for filming: I am donating time and filming, but will need help with out of pocket travel expenses. We would like to film at least two upcoming clinics in order to cover a variety of riders in a variety of locations. </li>
<li>Vintage footage and music: There is a small amount of archived footage available through British Pathe and MovieTime that will enhance this project so much (between $2,000 and $2,500). We have access to the original photographs, but the film footage and music just make such a big difference. </li>
<li>Post production: The more funds we are able to raise, the more archived footage and post production assistance we will be able to include. My goal is to make the film as polished as possible with your help!</li>
<li>Film Festival Fees: I'll submit at least one of the finished pieces to the EQUUS Film Festival for screening in November. The entry fees are due in June. Screening in New York would give the project a huge amount of exposure, not only in the theatre, but also through their online presence. EQUUS will also begin an online on demand channel and have permanent home at the Kentucky Horse Park which will bring more exposure to Karl and his work. </li>
<li>Distribution: Once we have the doc ready for festival submission, I'll have it preserved through Cinematique and have the DCP file created to facilitate distribution in the future. </li>
<li>If we aren't able to reach the entire funding goal, we will limit filming to one location and provide the necessary fees for festival admission. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Karl Mikolka was born in  1935 in Austria, into the turbulent times of ‘the war generation’ in the heart of a country facing the inevitability of World War II. At the age of 19, Karl was interviewed by Alois Podhajsky and subsequently accepted as an eléve at the Spanish Riding School. Within five years, he was promoted to Assistant Rider and eventually achieved the rank of Oberreiter, or Chief Rider, in 1967. Following the SRS, he traveled to Brazil to coach the Olympic Team and finally arrived in the US, training at Friar's Gate Farm in Massachusetts and Tempel Farms in Illinois. Always remaining loyal to the preservation of Classical training principles, Karl's work is a valuable piece of the equestrian culture, both from the past and continuing into the future.  His System provides a sound foundation for the well-being of horses and their riders, including every aspect of schooling the dressage horse and rider from Training Level to Grand Prix.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge that we face with this project is time and distance. As a full-time educator, I will be arranging travel to at least one location to film and interview Karl about his work as soon as possible, as my time allows. I am committed to entering at least one of the completed projects into this year's film festival in order to provide exposure for Karl and any other project that he may wish to promote within THIS year's festival tour, so finishing as much of the filming as possible soon is important. As long as we are able to film in a good location in a positive environment and capture as much of Karl's personality and stories, we can always add to longer edits later...I just want to make sure to capture as much as possible as soon as possible! There is an upcoming clinic in May, so if the funding allows, I will attend and get a jump start so that the editing can begin as school is slowing down. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I'm Julianne Neal, director and producer of Karl Mikolka: A Life in Service of the Horse. I have been a follower of Karl's System since the 1990s when I was fortunate enough to participate in a clinic in South Carolina presented by my long-time dressage trainer, Mary Werning. I was able to ride with Karl over the years from time to time and his training methods literally changed the way I rode and viewed dressage. Recently, after producing an equine documentary about Bruce Anderson's work and having great success and opportunities through film festivals and screenings, I was reintroduced to Karl and his work. I truly believe that film is an incredible way to showcase Karl and the importance that his work has, both historically and as the basis for true correct training for the horse. After speaking with Karl about this project and spending some time filming introductory interviews and several short training segments in a clinic setting, we came away in November with a plan to create a short introductory film and trailer for a longer piece. Over the next year, we will work toward gathering the footage for a 60 minute documentary that would delve into his history and the basics of how the System affects both horse and rider, and hopefully in the future to continue with a series of training films based on the exercises in the System.
After several months of work, a short ""reality tv"" style film (30 minute) introducing Karl through the eyes of Mary and one of her current students participating in the clinic is complete, as well as a 3 minute trailer for the longer doc. Now, it is time to gather the footage of training sessions specifically for the film and to speak more in depth with Karl about his amazing life.
I am so excited to bring the incredible story of Karl Mikolka to you. Your donations will make it possible to finish filming during several upcoming clinics, gather interview footage, purchase the necessary music and vintage footage rights and begin post production on the documentary, as well as to enter the initial short piece and trailer into the EQUUS Film Festival and other appropriate screening venues. Karl has been an influential trainer and rider for 67 years and deserves to have a great amount of recognition for that; but perhaps even more importantly, serious dressage riders and their horses deserve to have access to his complete System of classical training. We hope that this documentary, along with his other promotional materials, will help to spread that information with a  wider audience.
What We Need and What You Get

We need $10,000 to make this project happen:

Travel and expenses for filming: I am donating time and filming, but will need help with out of pocket travel expenses. We would like to film at least two upcoming clinics in order to cover a variety of riders in a variety of locations. 
Vintage footage and music: There is a small amount of archived footage available through British Pathe and MovieTime that will enhance this project so much (between $2,000 and $2,500). We have access to the original photographs, but the film footage and music just make such a big difference. 
Post production: The more funds we are able to raise, the more archived footage and post production assistance we will be able to include. My goal is to make the film as polished as possible with your help!
Film Festival Fees: I'll submit at least one of the finished pieces to the EQUUS Film Festival for screening in November. The entry fees are due in June. Screening in New York would give the project a huge amount of exposure, not only in the theatre, but also through their online presence. EQUUS will also begin an online on demand channel and have permanent home at the Kentucky Horse Park which will bring more exposure to Karl and his work. 
Distribution: Once we have the doc ready for festival submission, I'll have it preserved through Cinematique and have the DCP file created to facilitate distribution in the future. 
If we aren't able to reach the entire funding goal, we will limit filming to one location and provide the necessary fees for festival admission. 


The Impact
Karl Mikolka was born in  1935 in Austria, into the turbulent times of ‘the war generation’ in the heart of a country facing the inevitability of World War II. At the age of 19, Karl was interviewed by Alois Podhajsky and subsequently accepted as an eléve at the Spanish Riding School. Within five years, he was promoted to Assistant Rider and eventually achieved the rank of Oberreiter, or Chief Rider, in 1967. Following the SRS, he traveled to Brazil to coach the Olympic Team and finally arrived in the US, training at Friar's Gate Farm in Massachusetts and Tempel Farms in Illinois. Always remaining loyal to the preservation of Classical training principles, Karl's work is a valuable piece of the equestrian culture, both from the past and continuing into the future.  His System provides a sound foundation for the well-being of horses and their riders, including every aspect of schooling the dressage horse and rider from Training Level to Grand Prix.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge that we face with this project is time and distance. As a full-time educator, I will be arranging travel to at least one location to film and interview Karl about his work as soon as possible, as my time allows. I am committed to entering at least one of the completed projects into this year's film festival in order to provide exposure for Karl and any other project that he may wish to promote within THIS year's festival tour, so finishing as much of the filming as possible soon is important.

<h3><strong>Who Am I?</strong></h3>
<p>Hello there, I'm Matt Santora and I'm a senior at Brooklyn College.  I'm shooting my thesis film this semester and I need your help!</p>
<p>My story is about a young man, Hank, who can't seem to find ""the one"". Until one day he stumbles upon a lonely goldfish, thus beginning an awkward and funny love story like never seen before. This story dives into the glorious feelings of a new relationship, and their struggles. </p>
<p>Comedy is my passion. I've dabbled with stand-up many times.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've been studying comedic films to perfect my own work.  </p>
<p>I guarantee this film will make you laugh. </p>
<p>With your generous donations, I can bring this short story to life. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise $3,000.</p>
<p>With this money, I'll be able to make this film the way I believe is best.</p>
<p>Filmmaking, unfortunately, is a very expensive process.   </p>
<p>The money raised will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera Equipment:  Various lenses, a dolly, a tripod, follow focus, and monitors. </li>
<li>Food for cast &amp; crew: I have to make sure my cast and crew have good meals on set. </li>
<li>Transportation: Renting trucks so we can easily transport gear and crew. </li>
<li>Wardrobe &amp; Set Design: This film will play with various colors, so we can evoke emotions. </li>
<li>Paying Actors: I want to be able to pay my actors for their time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I plan on having various perks for you! </p>
<p>Such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal thank you email, from yours truly. </li>
<li>Personal thank you video, from yours truly. </li>
<li>A copy of the script.</li>
<li>Your name in the credits of the film. </li>
<li>A poster for the film, which is being crafted by a local artist. </li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I would have to cut many things from my budget. I would have to cut out getting better camera equipment. This would make my film seem less cinematic.  </p>
<h3>Why This Is Important:</h3>
<p>My dream has always been to be a comedian. I'm very passionate about writing and directing films. Which I've done over the years at Brooklyn College studying film production. </p>
<p>With this film, I plan on sending it to as many festivals as I can. I want this project to jump start my career in the film business. Filmmaking is a very tough business to get into. I'm taking this project very seriously, so this film can be as successful as possible.</p>

Without contributions this movie will not being able to exist. Raising these funds to tell this very personal story is so important to everyone on the team because we all believe in the power of film and how one story could affect the lives of another. With our film, we would like to send a clear and loud message that you don’t have to go through life alone. Even when it may feel that way.CastBehind the Scenes

Risks & ChallengesWith any film project especially one as ambitious as this one there are going to be some risks and challenges associated with it like,  1. Not being able to get the desired ""shot"" because of time constraints or budgetary concerns. We have a shot list and are confident in the look and feel of the film and will need every dollar to make this a reality while not compromising on the vision. 2. We could very well run out of money and be unable to finish the film at the quality that we know this film deserves. This story needs to be told and if we don't hit our goal or run out of money we would end up making a movie that does not live up to the idea's full potential. 3. Lastly is motivation, this is not solely contingent upon the campaign but does go hand in hand, in that if we don't hit our goal we may have people working harder and longer than they were paid to. While everyone feels passionately about this film you ultimately would like to keep enthusiasm high and hearts in lined to finish the film the right way.  Shooting a short film on a small budget over the course of 3 days seems like a simple and common task but we can assure that it’s not. It takes dedication and careful thought to achieve a good story in a short amount of time. We can guarantee that with your help, donations, and support, we will get this done. The script is fairly simple and in the writing of it we have tried to make sure this film is easy to shoot given our time table and window of opportunity. The locations are minimal and so is the shot listing. We have assembled a great production team who will work quickly to get what we need on the locations and make it look amazing.If you would like to donate, please check out the column on the right side of this page for more information, and some cool incentives as a small offering for your generosity. Every dollar towards our goal helps.Thanks for checking out our campaign and reading our story. Making it this far is truly appreciated.Other Ways You Can HelpAside from raising funds this campaign is about building an audience and creating awareness.The more people we reach - the better chance we have of hitting our campaign goal. This is important because we are all Daniel, people granted with extraordinary power who have to make difficult choices on a daily basisPlease help by sharing our story on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and all social media networks.https://igg.me/at/evenif",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>In 2015, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. At only 22, my invincible life as I knew it drastically changed. Something people don't tell you when you're sick, is how to navigate ""giving the news."" When you tell someone you have cancer, people show their kindness in surprising ways. Sometimes people made me laugh, sometimes (unbeknownst to them) they made me more self conscious than I've ever been in my life, and sometimes... sometimes it got weird. In the two years since, I have been writing and planning this film. Memento Mori is my own catalogue of those conversations, and serves as my strange love letter to those who supported me during those trying times.</p>

In 2015, I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. At only 22, my invincible life as I knew it drastically changed. Something people don't tell you when you're sick, is how to navigate ""giving the news."" When you tell someone you have cancer, people show their kindness in surprising ways. Sometimes people made me laugh, sometimes (unbeknownst to them) they made me more self conscious than I've ever been in my life, and sometimes... sometimes it got weird. In the two years since, I have been writing and planning this film. Memento Mori is my own catalogue of those conversations, and serves as my strange love letter to those who supported me during those trying times.

Based on a true story and set over the course of a night at a private poker game, the film tells the story of a man whose addiction has left him at rock bottom, in a web of lies too deep to maintain. The aim of the project is to raise awareness for the plight of gambling addiction in a country and era in which problem gamblers are endlessly encouraged to continue their habit.

Over the course of his marriage, his addiction to gambling has grown exponentially and drastically effected his personal life. Over the years, he’s lost tens of thousands at bookies, casinos and poker games. A year ago, after Ash lost his job in sales due to poor attendance, he vowed to overcome his addiction after his wife issued an ultimatum and threatened to leave him and take the kids. For a while, Ash managed to stay away from temptation through a job on an off-shore oil rig, but began secretly gambling again, quitting his job in the process due to unpaid debts to several colleagues. To maintain his wife’s perceptions of his new lifestyle, Ash has recently been sleeping in his car during the weeks she expects him to be working. He spends his days at various bookies and attends a private poker game a few nights a week hosted by a man name Aaron (Alan Calton). In the five years that Ash has been attending Aaron’s game, he’s lost thousands to him. Aaron regularly calls Ash and jovially invites him along to the games, informing him about supposedly poor players likely to be in attendance. Ash knows that Aaron perceives him as easy money but is ever-determined to win against his rival, willing, even, to risk everything to attempt to do so.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>The Team</u></strong></p><p><strong>Writer, Director and Producer</strong></p><p><i>Oliver James Spalding</i></p><p>Oliver James Spalding is a Norwich-based filmmaker whose work focuses on people on the outskirts of society.

<li>Most people gamble at some point in their lives, but for some gambling can become a serious addiction</li>
<li>For approximately 1% of UK gamblers, betting and playing games to win money can become a serious addiction, which can spiral out of control and affect their professional and social lives.</li>
<li>Around 350,000 people in the UK are suffering from a gambling addiction.</li>
<li>In recent years, the number of people experiencing problems with gambling has increased due to economic troubles associated with the global recession and an increase in the number of gambling outlets.</li>
<li>It is now easier than ever before to gamble, with a huge number of online betting shops and games sites enabling people to gamble 24 hours a day. Every year, over 7 billion pounds is spent on gambling.</li>
<li>The clear majority of people who could be classed as problem gamblers do not seek help for their addiction.</li>
<li>NHS statistics show that only around 5 percent of people seek help and only 1 percent get treatment for their gambling problem.</li>
<li>If a gambling problem is left to develop, debts can spiral out of control and people can become withdrawn and depressed, which can affect their professional lives and relationships with other people.</li>
<li>Gambling is very addictive; the adrenaline rush associated with the possibility of pulling off a big win is often described by gamblers as an unbeatable feeling.</li>
<li>The possibility of a win is extremely enticing to problem gamblers and they will carry on until they win, regardless of how much money they lose along the way.</li>

Based on a true story and set over the course of a night at a private poker game, the film tells the story of a man whose addiction has left him at rock bottom, in a web of lies too deep to maintain. The aim of the project is to raise awareness for the plight of gambling addiction in a country and era in which problem gamblers are endlessly encouraged to continue their habit. We're aiming to raise £3,000 to tell this story as effectively as possible. All InBased on a true story and set over a single night, All In, revolves around Ash (Tony Fadil), a gambling addict, taking the last of his money to a late night private poker game. Ash is in his early forties; he's been married for ten years and has two children, aged nine and seven. Over the course of his marriage, his addiction to gambling has grown exponentially and drastically effected his personal life. Over the years, he’s lost tens of thousands at bookies, casinos and poker games. A year ago, after Ash lost his job in sales due to poor attendance, he vowed to overcome his addiction after his wife issued an ultimatum and threatened to leave him and take the kids. For a while, Ash managed to stay away from temptation through a job on an off-shore oil rig, but began secretly gambling again, quitting his job in the process due to unpaid debts to several colleagues. To maintain his wife’s perceptions of his new lifestyle, Ash has recently been sleeping in his car during the weeks she expects him to be working. He spends his days at various bookies and attends a private poker game a few nights a week hosted by a man name Aaron (Alan Calton). In the five years that Ash has been attending Aaron’s game, he’s lost thousands to him. Aaron regularly calls Ash and jovially invites him along to the games, informing him about supposedly poor players likely to be in attendance. Ash knows that Aaron perceives him as easy money but is ever-determined to win against his rival, willing, even, to risk everything to attempt to do so. The TeamWriter, Director and ProducerOliver James SpaldingOliver James Spalding is a Norwich-based filmmaker whose work focuses on people on the outskirts of society.

<h3>80-86: Reigning in Spain and Beyond</h3>
<p>Many of you may well be aware of the work of myself, Evan Marshall, as producer/director of <i>Spirit of '58 </i>for Clackity Films. In that feature length film we told the story of the largely forgotten exploits of the Northern Ireland team who reached the quarter finals of the World Cup in 1958. If you have seen the film you will know that we left no stone unturned in our search for moving archive and photographic records of the team, even discovering footage of Northern Ireland's first game at the World Cup, unseen for over fifty years, which FIFA told us didn't exist. The film was turned by myself into an even more detailed book of the same name which was shortlisted for the eir Sports Book of the Year 2016. Well researched documentary-making and sports writing is what I do. Now I want to do it all over again but for the 1980s.</p>
<p>I was eleven years old when Gerry Armstrong walked into immortality by scoring the winning goal against host nation Spain in the 1982 World Cup to send Northern Ireland into the quarter final groups. It is a night forever burned into my memories and during the years of 1980 to 1986 there were others along with it. Already the smallest team to ever qualify for the World Cup in 1958, Northern Ireland went on to qualify for two more in the 1980s while also being crowned British Champions outright in 1980 for the first time since 1918. They would also win the final ever British Championship in 1984 to keep the trophy forever and memorably beat the then-current European Champions and World Cup runners-up West Germany home and away during the qualifying for the 1984 Euros. This was a purple patch of success which has never been equalled before or since.</p>
<p>It is all the stranger then that no one has ever made a documentary which covered these glorious years in full. But that's about to change. The same team behind <i>Spirit of '58 </i>has been beavering away on the research for this period and will bring it alive in the spring of 2018 with a wide range of new interviews with the key players from this period, archive interviews from the vault, match footage from the British Championships, qualifying games and the World Cups in Spain and Mexico. You'll see the programmes, souvenirs, sticker albums, teams songs and the progress of the fans who followed the team all represented on screen. In short, if you've seen <i>Spirit of '58</i>, you'll know that we'll do this right and bring it all to life with a soundtrack representing those early years of the 80s.</p>
<p>If you contributed to <i>Spirit of '58 </i>two years ago, first of all, thank you. Secondly, you will know that clearing the archive for a film like this, which gives all the due respect to its subject matter, is expensive. <i>80-86 </i>will be more expensive to clear the rights for than <i>Spirit of '58</i>. This time the team went to two World Cups and not one and the BBC and ITV footage will be a lot more expensive to clear than the Pathe and Movietone clips we previously used. We are confident though of raising more funds down the line for the clearances this time around so what we are looking for now is simply our start-up money. We envisage interviewing up to ten players from the team of this period and quite a few of these will be based on the mainland. Currently, we foresee a week of shooting and travelling with a crew to pay for outside of Northern Ireland with a number of days interviewing those who live locally in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>On top of this we will then need to pay for previews of all the footage available and to pay for our sound studio work with a voice artist. Then there is the editing of the film later this year. We're happy to pay for the final clearances next year from future funding when post production costs will need to be factored in on the sound and grading of colour but, to cover what we need up front, and to make this film as good as it can possibly be, we will require £10,000. If we get more than that, brilliant. We'll be able to do more and do it better, but £10,000 is what we need to get a good head start and get the film into some sort of shape.</p>
<p>As before, there are a range of perks available to those who contribute certain amounts. The writing of the book version has already commenced and we plan a simultaneous release of film and book this time around rather than the year long gap which there was for <i>Spirit of '58</i>. Therefore you can opt to get a copy of the book for your donation. The full transcript book of all the interviews was a popular option last time around and we're offering it again with over double the number of interviewees this time. Donations to this fundraiser, just as with <i>Spirit of '58</i>, will be the only way of receiving this fully illustrated A4 book. We also aim to invite as many players as possible to the premiere next year so our top perk is a VIP ticket into the player zone with complimentary drinks before the screening.</p>
<p>You've seen what we've done before and now we want to do it again. Please help us make it possible so that this glorious period of Northern Irish footballing history can be documented fully in the way it so richly deserves.</p>
<p>If the phrase, ""Arconada... Armstrong!"" means as much to you as it does to me then I hope you'll join us in helping to create a fantastic record of those times.</p>

<p><i>This film and this journey over the past several years are very dear to me and my team's heart. There have already been countless hours spent making this story be one of the most incredible, powerful, and entertaining film you will see.  From the first word ever written on the script, it has been my dream that everyone gets to experience this world as intimately as I have, to delve into the riches of the playground we have created and to immerse yourself into the creative layout of the ""Disillusioned"" experience. AND THE GREATEST part of this film is it will be completed with the spirit of unity, team, and a beautiful partnership between myself, my team, and YOU!! This film will happen because of YOU and YOUR INCREDIBLE LOVE AND SUPPORT for our vision. You will be the reason that this story gets to be shared with the world and I already cannot thank you enough! - Josh Marble (Creator/Director)<br/></i></p>

<p><i><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></b></i></p>
<p>When Emma, a college-aged girl with a broken past, is coerced by her older sister Heidi and her friend Natalie to take some time away from school and a non-existent social life, they escape away to a camping trip for what will literarily the trip of their lives. </p>
<p>Joined by Heidi's long time friend Andrew, his best friend Issac, and a socially awkward Peter, the group enjoy the beauty and freedom that the solitude of the woods provide. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">When supplies run low, the group travels to a lonely general store to restock. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">While there, Peter encounters a curious old man who invites Peter to partake in a special drug he claims he concocted himself; a private remedy that will allow ones deepest fantasies to temporarily come to life. Desiring to experience his </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">fantasy and to escape the isolation he feels in his life</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Peter </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">accepts the offer and returns back to the group. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Unbeknownst to Peter, both the substance and the old man are a much darker mystery than Peter would have thought to believe, and the group has just become a new set of test subjects in a twisted scientist's game.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Once back at the campsite, </span>the group<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> retire around their campfire for a relaxing evening, their intent solely focused on enjoying </span>each<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> others company. However, when it is </span>discovered<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> that Peter now posses such a unique gift, some of them give in to the curiosity of what it would be like to live out their deepest fantasy, while others resist the fear </span>of<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> the unknown. When a small skirmish breaks out over whether or not the group should be party to this unknown substance, an accidental spill causes the entire group to be exposed to the drug and victim to its effects.</span></p>
<p>Knowing there is no other option but to ride out the effects of the drugs, the group continues to explore the world of each other’s fantasies.  As the fantasies continue however, the group begin to notice that the longer the fantasies go on, the more demented and twisted they turn. After a fantasy involving a reunion of some dearly departed loved ones turns into a violent recreation of their initial death, the group fully realizes this drug is not what they thought it was.</p>
<p>Trapped under the influence of the drug, the group find it harder and harder to break away from these evil and demented nightmares that are now encompassing all of the fantasies. When Peter is tormented into madness by the power of his nightmare, the repercussions on the rest of the group cause them all to understand that one or many of them could die if they can’t find a solution to escaping these nightmares soon.</p>

<p><i><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Words from Creator/Director Josh Marble</b><br/></i></p>
<p><i>Disillusioned is a story many years in the making that I am very excited to share.  Packed with action, suspense, and hair-raising moments of uncertainty, this story takes the viewers imagination to a plane of possibility where both the impossible and the possible co-exist. The line between reality and imagination, of factual and fictional, blend together in a cacophony of possibility for anything, and everything. And all it takes to get us there is one simple drug.  Inspired by films such as “The Hunger Games,” “Cabin in the Woods,” “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” “The Last House on the Left,” and “Inception,” and by the direction of some of my favorite directors such as “Bryan Singer,” “Gary Ross,” “David Yates,” and “Joss Whedon”, I found myself creating this film.</i></p>
<i>This style of film provides the freedom to play in such a capacity where the story is able to come to life in a powerful and believable way. In a genre that allows for so much possibility, Disillusioned is allowed the freedom to expand all horizons and create a world where even the farthest possibilities are still possible, all the while keeping the entirety of the story in a world that does not exceed the point of believability.</i>

Disillusioned Logline
A group of young adults enjoying a fun camping get away become exposed to an experimental drug that make one’s deepest fantasies temporarily come to life. But when the drugs real purpose takes effect, they all have to fight to retain their sanity as they try and decipher what is real and what is fantasy.

Disillusioned Storyline (WARNING: SPOILERS)

When Emma, a college-aged girl with a broken past, is coerced by her older sister Heidi and her friend Natalie to take some time away from school and a non-existent social life, they escape away to a camping trip for what will literarily the trip of their lives. 
Joined by Heidi's long time friend Andrew, his best friend Issac, and a socially awkward Peter, the group enjoy the beauty and freedom that the solitude of the woods provide. When supplies run low, the group travels to a lonely general store to restock. While there, Peter encounters a curious old man who invites Peter to partake in a special drug he claims he concocted himself; a private remedy that will allow ones deepest fantasies to temporarily come to life. Desiring to experience his fantasy and to escape the isolation he feels in his life, Peter accepts the offer and returns back to the group. Unbeknownst to Peter, both the substance and the old man are a much darker mystery than Peter would have thought to believe, and the group has just become a new set of test subjects in a twisted scientist's game.
Once back at the campsite, the group retire around their campfire for a relaxing evening, their intent solely focused on enjoying each others company. However, when it is discovered that Peter now posses such a unique gift, some of them give in to the curiosity of what it would be like to live out their deepest fantasy, while others resist the fear of the unknown. When a small skirmish breaks out over whether or not the group should be party to this unknown substance, an accidental spill causes the entire group to be exposed to the drug and victim to its effects.
Knowing there is no other option but to ride out the effects of the drugs, the group continues to explore the world of each other’s fantasies.  As the fantasies continue however, the group begin to notice that the longer the fantasies go on, the more demented and twisted they turn. After a fantasy involving a reunion of some dearly departed loved ones turns into a violent recreation of their initial death, the group fully realizes this drug is not what they thought it was.
Trapped under the influence of the drug, the group find it harder and harder to break away from these evil and demented nightmares that are now encompassing all of the fantasies. When Peter is tormented into madness by the power of his nightmare, the repercussions on the rest of the group cause them all to understand that one or many of them could die if they can’t find a solution to escaping these nightmares soon.
Film Duration:
Feature Length - Estimated 90-100 minutes run time.



Words from Creator/Director Josh Marble
Disillusioned is a story many years in the making that I am very excited to share.  Packed with action, suspense, and hair-raising moments of uncertainty, this story takes the viewers imagination to a plane of possibility where both the impossible and the possible co-exist. The line between reality and imagination, of factual and fictional, blend together in a cacophony of possibility for anything, and everything. And all it takes to get us there is one simple drug.  Inspired by films such as “The Hunger Games,” “Cabin in the Woods,” “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,” “The Last House on the Left,” and “Inception,” and by the direction of some of my favorite directors such as “Bryan Singer,” “Gary Ross,” “David Yates,” and “Joss Whedon”, I found myself creating this film.
This style of film provides the freedom to play in such a capacity where the story is able to come to life in a powerful and believable way. In a genre that allows for so much possibility, Disillusioned is allowed the freedom to expand all horizons and create a world where even the farthest possibilities are still possible, all the while keeping the entirety of the story in a world that does not exceed the point of believability.



“Disillusioned is a sure success filled with twists, turns, heart, soul, and romance. Just when you think you know where it’s going, it surprises you in a different direction. I love movies that make me think, and I love movies where I am on the edge of my seat. This is that movie! I am so excited to be a part of this project!” 



“Disillusioned is so unique, it really doesn't fit the mold of any particular genre I've seen before - it has something to say on a number of different levels and through completely unexpected means, which is why I'm so excited to be a part of this film. At any point, if you think you know where it's going...think again.”

...and like you a member of the masses.



I have a degree in filmmaking and I have more than 30 years of experience in the film industry. This experience includes working in front and behind the camera, as well as, in the business side of the Industry.  I have been the Director of Marketing and Sales for production companies, graphics and animation companies, and distribution companies.
I have given lectures about film techniques, marketing strategies, and more in Italy, Japan, and throughout the United States.
I'm also a product developer and entrepreneur.

I have been honored with being invited in 2006 as an awards presenter of an incredible International event that travels for almost 45 days throughout Southern Italy called CinemadaMare Film Festival.


       

SCRIPTANK!
Now will be Serving the Global Masses!


A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FILM INDUSTRY
* On average 25,000 movie scripts are submitted to Hollywood alone every year, yet less than 5% makes it to the theaters...and some are Box Office Bombs!

* Filmmakers around the world agree that many good, even great scripts go unread, unproduced, and undistributed because of the bottleneck that has been created in Hollywood! 


  

WHY I NEED YOUR SUPPORT


A typical social networking website will cost more than a million dollars to develop, launch, and host. I have designed Scriptank in sections and the first section, the Script Section, will fund or pay for all the subsequent section to be launched and so on. That's why we only need $200,000 to launch Scriptank.

I have already invested  thousands of dollars into Scriptank for things such as the initial flowchart concept, wireframes, research and development, trademarks, initial attorneys fees, and other work.

But, now the time is ripe!

It's time to build the actual website that will make this all happen. It will only take a few months from the point we are at now to launch Scriptank and make it all happen.
We want our official launch to be at the American Film Market 2015 in Santa Monica. 
Your financial support will help us accomplish this goal.

 Your sponsorship does not pay for me or my wages.  I have an income that covers my expenses until Scriptank is launched and successfully running.




NEW PERKS! 
Every sponsor $20 and above receives a coffee mug! Adding more perks as we go. Sponsor now and still receive new perks.

Every sponsor $25 and above receives a t-shirt! Adding more perks as we go. Sponsor now and still receive new perks.

<p></p>
<p>I know, without any doubt, that performing this show in December is
only the beginning of this vision. Once created, I plan on taking the show around the world,
performing it wherever it’s needed be it eating disorder treatment centers, conferences or universities. </p>
<p>I intend on pairing workshops and panel discussions with the

want to perform the show, including recovering eating disorder clients who are
now committed to spreading the message that saved their lives.</p>
My vision doesn’t stop here! I plan on creating

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>~ THE IMPACT ~</b></p>

<p>My show is about more than eating disorders and my story is
about more than just me. <b>It is for anyone who is <i>human, who experiences shame about who they are, who wants liberation
from their pain.</i></b> </p>
<p>Because we are all made up of light and dark, the way we
relate to our darkness is the key to whether we live a joyful, loving life.
When we reject our darkest parts, we ALL suffer. When we embrace our darkness
as divine, we transform and alchemize our hidden, shadowed parts. </p>

</div></div>","The SynopsisA creature from another world imprisons a woman inside her house and breeds her for food. It's 'Alien' meets 'Misery' but much darker and more sinister than either. Our GoalWe are a small team from the North West of England  and with our funding (supplied by you incredibly wonderful human beings!) we will create a genuinely frightening and original full length horror feature film.  Everyone on the team is a huge horror fan, but few of us can remember a recent horror film that actually left us wanting to hide under our bed covers at night with the lights on! We want to change that and make a film that really gets under your skin and leaves you terrified and shaken to the core. We will  craft an original horror film that leaves much unexplained. We are not going to hand hold you and explain our alien or it's motives. It's alien. It want's to eat it's offspring. How could we explain the thought processes or motivations behind such an horrific thing? Much better that the film creep you out and leaves unanswered questions that terrify for many more nights to come! We want the film to fuel your own imagination and leave you thoroughly disturbed... We're not looking for cheap shocks. We are aiming for gritty realism filmed with as much  practical special effects as possible. We want to create the most realistic and believable terror that you've ever seen.The trailer we've made is to give you an idea of the tone we're going for. None of the footage in the trailer will be re-used and the final film will look even more incredible.(On set with our incredible make-up artist Blaise Gresley!)
Our Influences
Mostly horror and sci-fi! Some of our favourite films include:  Imprint, Alien, Xtro, The Shining, The Fly, Hellraiser, Nightbreed, Cannibal Holocaust, Antichrist, The Babadook, The Thing, Tenebrae.

The Team
We are David aiming to make a movie that can compete with the Goliath that is the big studio system. A system which spawns endless remakes and sequels: unoriginal garbage. As independent filmmakers we aim to offer you quality film-making with an original story that doesn’t insult your intelligence with a cheap cash in. 
Simon M Riley: Director/Writer

Simon's  work encompass music videos, shorts, commercials and 
photography with an emphasis on strongly cinematic visuals often with a 
dark and surreal undertone. 

Simon has always been passionate about filmmaking and shot his first short film (House of Evil) when he was 12:
""Making those films as a kid was so much fun! House of Evil involved pulling an all nighter with my cousin (and co-star) and probably used up the north of England's entire supply of tomato ketchup. We performed all our own stunts too. I think I pushed Chris down the stairs multiple times because I wasn't convinced he was injured on the descent the first couple of tumbles. Thinking back that must've hurt but it was hey it was funny at the time!""


Portia Victoria: Producer/Actress
Portia regularly helps to produce Simon's music videos and short films. She has a diploma in performing arts and has experience organising large, live, theatrical events. She has worked in the entertainment industry as a stage manager, performer and model. Her previous clients include: HBO Entertainment, L'Oreal, BBC, ITV, Vidal Sassoon and Wella.

Colin is an invaluable member of the team as he is onboard in his capacity to help us with some of the shooting space as well as his skills as a cameraman and equipment specialist.
