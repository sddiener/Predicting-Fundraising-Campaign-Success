<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Aileen Kyoko and Melanie Evans met at the Maggie Flanigan Acting Studio where they realized their artistic synergy and alignment. They have finally teamed up to produce exciting contemporary theatre together. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.aileenkyoko.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aileen Kyoko</a> is the playwright, director and original producer of <a href=""https://www.theyearofthesolareclipse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Year of the Solar Eclipse</a>. Aileen’s work has been featured at The Davenport Theatre, The Producer’s Club, Teatro La Tea and The Playwright’s Loft. As a bi-racial artist, she is determined to tell stories that reflect the diverse world in which we live. Aileen specializes in writing naturalistic dramedies- searching for both the humor and conflicting emotions in this thing we call life.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/melevansny/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Melanie Evans</a> is an actor, singer, and producer currently in the First National Broadway tour of Falsettos. She is the first woman of color to understudy and perform the lead role of Rosalie Mullins in the first national broadway tour of School of Rock. Other credits include First National tour of Motown The Musical and Radio City Christmas. Melanie was selected out of 7,000 applicants to participate in the 2015 NBC Diversity showcase at New World Stages in NYC. </p>
<h3>The Year of The Solar Eclipse</h3>
<ul>
<li>The play made its World Premiere at the Planet Connections Theatre Festival in July 2018 with 6 performances. It was nominated for 6 awards including: outstanding production, scenic design, original song, performance by leading actresses (2x) and performance by featured actor. </li>
<li>The play follows three women in a shocking year of love lost, love found, and self-discovery. This is a dramedy about the bright and dark sides of relationships and all the brilliant shades in between.</li>

<h3>How will the play be different than last year?</h3>

<li>After a World Premiere in 2018 with sold out shows, it became clear that there was a demand for this production. As grateful as we are for the theatre festival experience- we are excited to tell the <strong>full story</strong> that we couldn't due to festival timing limitations. </li>

But...it’s also the place you get a bed, a roof over your head...For me, right now, it’s the only place in the world where someone cares enough to check whether I’m in my bed every night.

<p>As a company of female (trans + cisgender) and LGBTQ+ artists we are committed to promoting gender-equality in the British theatre industry by exclusively showcasing the work of female (trans + cisgender) and LGBTQ+ artists. Lady Muck and Knot Theatre are collaborating on this project in order to support each other as female and LGBTQ+ led companies as well as the development of a new, essential play that challenges social preconceptions about victims of domestic violence, the criminal justice system and the ""nature"" of women. </p>
<p>We are raising money to fund our production (rehearsal space, props, costume + set) and to ensure that all the female and LGBTQ+ artists involved are properly and fairly paid.

<h3>What Is VANDALS?</h3>
<p>One year after the killing of Heather Heyer at the Charlottesville riots, the world is a different place. A new devised theater piece opening October 12th (previews begin October 10th)  at The Tank , VANDALS, developed over the course of last year, charts our national mood and the crisis of public monuments.</p>
<p>You may know the VANDALS as the tribe responsible for hacking off all the noses and penises from the Roman statues at the Met. VANDALS  adapts a public trial of a war hero/criminal into a founding myth for democracy. It  explores the personal histories of the cast to unearth the question, “What do you need to change about the past in order to live in the present?”</p>
<p>“There’s a debate underway in America,” says co-director Will Hand, “about whether or not words and images can be themselves violent...I wanted to provide a framework for us all to approach this question, ‘how much can we stomach of the past, and what do we have to change to live in today’s America?’  I see this idea being hashed out in a very public way, in museums, in universities, and in theaters.”</p>
<p>Vandals is a theater piece unlike any other. It breaks down moulds of ‘character’ and authorship to create a theater that is surprising, formally experimental, and socially exigent.</p>

The How’s mission is to create a place for audiences and artists to be challenged by a multiplicity of viewpoints, forms, and stories.

<h3>What Do We Want To Accomplish?</h3>

<li>
<strong>Pay Our Artists:</strong> We worked with a group who refracted and reflected different experiences and viewpoints on vandalism as protest.

<li>
<strong>Reach New Audiences: </strong>We work fiercely to promote our shows. We put the word out through guerilla techniques like wheatpasting or enlisting bar patrons to vandalize art for instagram, as well as more traditional means like paid advertising. While paying artists is always our highest priority, throwing $1000 into ROI doesn't hurt. </li>
<li>
<strong>Tell Our Story: </strong>The remainder of our funds raised go directly towards helping our design team realize the production.</li>

<h3 style=""text-align: right;""> What Are We Up Against?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: right;""> We rely on curatorial opportunities to pioneer new works and experiments. Meanwhile, the face of the underground is changing. 70 performance spaces have disappeared from New York in the past decade, with 10 more in danger of foreclosure.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Bringing a work to premiere is harder than ever, but we are carving out our way one show at a time, all thanks to The Tank, and our fabulous network of friends, fans, and supporters. Thanks to people like you, the candle keeps burning, no matter the attempts at sanitization, gentrification and cultural erasure the developers push forward.</p>

<h3>About The Tank</h3>
<p>THE TANK is a Manhattan-based multi-disciplinary arts presenter and producer. Their mission is to remove economic barriers from the creation of new work by artists launching their careers and experimenting within their art form. Their goal is to do this in an environment that is inclusive and accessible to all. The heart of their services is providing free performance space, and they also offer a suite of other resources such as free rehearsal space, artist fees, and promotional support. They keep ticket prices affordable and view their work as democratic, opening up both the creation and attendance of the arts to all.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of Co-Artistic Directors Rosalind Grush and Meghan Finn, in September of 2017, the company moved to their new home in the Theater Building at 312 W 36th Street where they took full control over two theaters: a 98-seat proscenium and a 56-seat blackbox theater. They anticipate that this year we will serve over 2,000 artists presenting 800 performances by emerging artists from throughout the five boroughs.</p>

Posts are free, though. So if your heart is in the right place and last week's paycheck didn't pass muster, consider throwing in a good word, a retweet, a like, or a share on social media. Or just tell a friend about us. Or someone whose standing next to you. Or whatever.

They destroy every vestige of civilization left after a brutal war. They’ve slaughtered the men and captured the women, whom they brutally assault and separate from their children.

That’s what Ruby In The Dust have done with their production of ""DORIAN"", transforming it into a ‘Rock Musical’. </p><p>Set in a fantasy world; it is a London as we know it, but with a glam coating that fits perfectly with this modern-day, rock musical retelling of “The Picture of Dorian Gray”. “DORIAN” began its life as a gala evening at Café Royal, in the very room where Oscar Wilde used to entertain his bohemian, musician, actor friends and gave readings of his work. John Gray, the real-life inspiration for the character of “Dorian”, was one of these guests. Staged on Oscar Wilde’s birthday, one could almost feel his presence in the room.

Together, they’ve brought more than 12 productions to the stage that run the gamut from the fringe to the West End. They’ve proven their skill at integrating original and interpolated music into the text. Of Bonnie and Clyde, The Times critic wrote that it conjured a “powerful visual and musical atmosphere.” They’ve won raves for their musical shows and because the stamp of authenticity that they place on every production is simultaneously true to its roots and boldly original, they’ve been able to use music that already claims a steadfast audience and introduce it to new ones. They received the blessing of the Cole Porter Estate to use several Porter compositions for their production of Hutch. The late Dr John gave them permission to use several of his songs for their New Orleans jazz inspired version of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, setting Shakespeare’s magical tale in the Jazz Clubs of Bourbon Street and the dark, moody mystery of the Louisiana bayous. Their adaptation of The Great Gatsby was developed with Royal Shakespeare Company’s director Adrian Noble, and recently has enjoyed a sell-out run as a Concert Performance at London’s famous ‘Crazy Coqs’ in Piccadilly. The Telegraph said of the production of the F. Scott Fitzgerald classic that it “grips throughout”.</p><p>Ruby in the Dust ( <a href=""http://www.rubyinthedusttheatre.london"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.rubyinthedusttheatre.london</a> ) are a theatre company who have developed theatre pieces around complex relationships taken from biographies or classical works, and finding the contemporary relevance which illuminates the work; thus engaging our audiences by allowing them to identify with the issues and the personalities presented. Although the source material is often from a particular period in history, it is always rendered ‘timeless’, reflecting the current political and social climate of today.

<h3>WHAT IS BLUNDERLAND</h3>
<p>Decadent, irreverent, hilarious, queer, psychedelic, naughty, and surreal</p>
<p>Born out of both New York Underground Club and contemporary cabaret culture. We are more than just another variety show, we are a call to arms for a life lived at the limits of your imagination, an insistence on expression, a seduction, and heady dose of more than the legal amount of mischief. </p>
<p>A decade in and we are one of the premier variety shows in NYC with monthly shows at the infamous House of Yes. 2 Years ago we started doing shows in New Orleans followed by London and now in 2020, it is time for our greatest adventure yet as we head down to AUSTRALIA for the Adelaide Fringe Festival!!!</p>
<p>12 artists representing our casts from each of our current home bases will perform a run of 27 shows at the largest arts festival in the southern hemisphere!!!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need...</h3>
<p>Well, we started looking at numbers and to our surprise, airlines do not allow you to treat them like a clown car. So a real budget happened and it had many zeros, the number we kept coming up with was between $85,000 and $120,000. WOW!!</p>
<p>Why so many zeros?!?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<ul>
<li>Festival: Fees, equipment, marketing, printing, tech, insurance.</li>
<li>Artists: Airfare, housing, and payment for 12 performers for 5 weeks in Australia</li>
<li>Creative: Aerial equipment, costumes, design, media, music licensing</li>
</ul>
<p>It all adds up!! To present a brilliant show on the other side of the globe is AMBITIOUS!!  So we started raising funds and now are so close!! With about $35,000 we can make this incredibly ambitious show happen and take it around the world!!! With more the sky is the limit to what we can do!!!</p>
<p>And shucks do we have some fun items and experiences for folks who wanna help. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Blunderland is as much about community as it is about entertainment, we have been lucky in how we have created an international web of weirdos and wondermakers, we participate in the artistic and local communities we perform in. We create opportunities for our performers and foster collaboration between various creatives. </p>
<p>There are very few American shows in the genre of variety which have tackled the international circuit in the way we are about to!</p>
<p>Here we are, a show that started a decade ago about to play 27 shows in a 450 seat circus tent halfway around the world. And that is just the beginning!! </p>
<p>This rabbit hole is primed and Alice is ready to jump!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help with a donation today please feel free to make some noise on social media about our efforts, come and see a show sometime, or just think nice thoughts about us clowns and we figure out how to take over the world!!</p>

It all adds up!! To present a brilliant show on the other side of the globe is AMBITIOUS!!  So we started raising funds and now are so close!! With about $35,000 we can make this incredibly ambitious show happen and take it around the world!!! With more the sky is the limit to what we can do!!!
And shucks do we have some fun items and experiences for folks who wanna help. 

The Impact
Blunderland is as much about community as it is about entertainment, we have been lucky in how we have created an international web of weirdos and wondermakers, we participate in the artistic and local communities we perform in. We create opportunities for our performers and foster collaboration between various creatives. 
There are very few American shows in the genre of variety which have tackled the international circuit in the way we are about to!
Here we are, a show that started a decade ago about to play 27 shows in a 450 seat circus tent halfway around the world. And that is just the beginning!! 
This rabbit hole is primed and Alice is ready to jump!!!

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't help with a donation today please feel free to make some noise on social media about our efforts, come and see a show sometime, or just think nice thoughts about us clowns and we figure out how to take over the world!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>EXCAVATION Spring 2019 Workshop</h3>
<p>I am developing my first full-length original theater project! I need help!</p>
<p>EXCAVATION is a multi-medium theatre project that uses my Appalachian heritage and my family’s oral history as an arena for excavating lineages of settler-colonialism in the Americas.</p>
<p>I grew up with a super-granma who imparted me with story after story about my Appalachian ancestors. In EXCAVATION, I turn to Gigi’s stories to try to understand more about grief, intergenerational trauma, and home. Once I begin digging, however, I end up in a much bigger confrontation with my settler-colonizer ancestors.</p>
<p>EXCAVATION looks at how the stories we pass on shape our understandings of ourselves and the world we live in. Working within Appalachian story-telling forms, I look at how me and my family have used stories to obscure our roles in the history and persistence of colonization, and to deny culpability. But I also go to these same forms, these same stories, to ask how these traditions could be transformed and used in the service of decolonizing.</p>
<p>This is a piece of interdisciplinary story-telling -- incorporating text, movement, acapella singing, and live soundscape --  and presented within a ritual container which lives somewhere at the intersection of folk magic and church!</p>
<p>I'm currently in my first developmental workshop with an ensemble and full creative team!  Yahoo!  I am moved, excited, terrified, and so grateful. I need to pay them, plus cover other expenses incurred during this 7-week workshop period. I am planning on securing grant funding for future development, but right now, I still need your help! Any contribution would mean so much to me. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Collaborators</h3>
<p>Azure D. Osborne Lee (director)<br/>Marisela Grajeda Gonzalez (dramaturg)<br/>Ali Dineen (music director)<br/>Athena Zammit (design)</p>
<p>Performers: Dominic Bradley, Jennifer Cendaña Armas, Mariah Plante, Jai Mohan, Alessandra Ruiz<br/> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><strong>What we need to cover with this crowdfunding campaign:</strong><br/>Performer Stipends - $1500<br/>Creative &amp; Production Team Stipends - $1050<br/>Performance &amp; Tech space - $225<br/>Costumes &amp; props - $150<br/>Indiegogo Fees - $235</p>
<p><strong>What we hope to cover with ticket sales:</strong><br/>books &amp; printing - $75<br/>casting notice postings - $75<br/>office &amp; art supplies - $25<br/>snacks for weekend rehearsals - $75</p>
<p><b>Leftovers:</b><br/>Last September I did a smaller Indiegogo campaign to help cover the expenses of a developmental residency for this project. I exceeded my goal by $243. I used that money towards the cost of liability event insurance for the upcoming showing this spring ($250, required by venue). </p>
<p><strong>If we surpass our goal again, any excess funds will be used towards future development, and/or to cover any remaining expenses not covered by ticket sales. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>This is a piece of devised theater. Which means that it is being created in close collaboration with the ensemble and creative team. Most of it is not pre-scripted. Our rehearsals are generative. I love creating in this way. I love process-oriented, ensemble-driven work. It is my favorite kind of theater. But it does take time.</p>
<p>This spring workshop is the first of a series of workshop periods I'll be conducting over the next couple years as this project progresses. Between each workshop, I'll take time to write and ruminate and revise in response to what gets created in rehearsals.</p>
<p>My collaborators play a central role in this process, and it's important that I compensate them for their labor. Being a performing artist in NYC takes HUSTLE.  As public funding for the arts decreases, finding paid (even lowly paid) gigs is getting harder and harder. It's a labor of love, and your contribution can help us keep it up. </p>
<p>Thank you so much!!!</p>

<h2>Blood Bank: A Theatre Noir</h2>
<p>Based loosely on the Bon Iver song of the same name, Blood Bank is a play in the noir genre that explores infidelity, stagnancy, the dangers of comfort, and the price of secrecy.</p>

But waiting is hard.  Bill’s 44th is an original comedic show that brings two puppeteers together to create one (very worried) protagonist.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The road to get here</h3>
<p><i>Bill's 44th</i> began as a response to a Puppet Slam (a slam is a night of puppet theater shorts typically all created in response to a theme) commission from <a href=""http://puppethomecoming.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Puppet Homecoming</a>. The prompt, ""They're coming,"" made us want to make a piece about someone waiting for their birthday guests to arrive. We ended up having other work during that time so the idea sat on a shelf until Dixon Place's 'Puppet Blok' in 2018. </p>
<p>Bill sprung to life and after a lovely first response we decided to try our hand at making the show a full-length piece of puppetry. 2019 involved us applying and receiving the <a href=""http://hensonfoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jim </a><a href=""https://www.hensonfoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Henson Foundation's</a> Production Grant, and experimenting with a ton of new ideas that almost all were thrown out (Sorry Bill's mom!). Nearing the end of 2019 we were accepted to <a href=""http://stannswarehouse.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Puppet Lab at St. Ann's Warehouse</a> where we planned to develop 20 minutes of shiny new content for the show.</p>
<p>Of course, the world changed, and a lot of plans got put on hold, but Bill pushed on in the digital realm. We were commissioned by the <a href=""https://www.newyorkstatepuppetfestival.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York State Puppetry Festival</a> as the first piece in their NYSPF@HOME series. We completed rewrote the show and made a 30 minute 'ZOOM' Version. We destroyed our apartment, but we had a lot of fun in process!</p>
<p>Now <a href=""http://dixonplace.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dixon Place</a> is ready to open up to a limited audience!! And we are overjoyed to completely retool the show for this new set of circumstances.<br/><br/>If you want tickets, but don't want any sweet rewards:<br/><a href=""http://dixonplace.org/performances/bills-44th-06-02-2021/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://dixonplace.org/performances/bills-44th-0...</a><br/> </p>

<p>My name is <a href=""https://zouksidedown.wordpress.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gaëlle Le Vu</a> and I am addicted to Brazilian Zouk – it's very healthy though, I promise!</p>
<p>I have taught different forms of dancing since 2009, although I am also an eternal learner and that's how I like to see myself the most. I have done pole dancing, circus, oriental dancing, many couple dances, but Brazilian Zouk was the one that touched me the most, from the first seconds I laid my eyes on it.</p>

For me, it is way more than that. Zouk, in particular, has transformed me as a person. It has transformed the way I interact with people, the way I see life; it has inspired me in so many ways and given me so many ideas. It has helped me become more creative and listen to the music in sublime new ways... The list is endless.<br/></p>
<p>For this reason, my project is to raise enough money so I can make a documentary about Zouk in Rio. Since Zouk is very popular here, and I am here right now, I want to take advantage of this time to make a documentary that will finally showcase what Zouk is like.</p>
<p>I want this to not only make zoukers proud that they are dancing Zouk, but also bring awareness about the dance to the rest of the world, and try to faithfully showcase everything that zoukers experience through this unique dance.</p>
<p>In case you are not a Zouk dancer yourself, here are two demos of (I dare say...) probably the most famous Zouk couple in Rio, the King and Queen of improvisation:<br/></p>

</h3>
<div>I am Lucy Warren-Whitman, the Artistic Director of North Atlantic dance Theatre (formerly known as North Atlantic Ballet).  As we are beginning preparations for our 2015 season, we at North Atlantic Dance Theatre have been tasked with the chore of raising funds for this season's performances and we are in need of your support. </div>
<div>Who are we?</div>
<p>North Atlantic Dance Theatre  is a collaborative dance company challenging audiences with emotionally charged performances. We offer smaller classical ballets that are rarely seen and present audiences with the opportunity to embrace these powerful stories and become enchanted by them. We also nurture and encourage Dancers, Choreographers, Musicians, and Visual Artists to use the company as a platform to mold their talents and ideas; to create innovative and visually stimulating performances for our audiences and artist communities. </p>
<p>North Atlantic Dance Theatre performed Vivaldi's Four seasons in September. This was made possible by supporters like you, making donations to our ""Let's get this party started"" Indiegogo fundraiser. The funds we raised made it possible for us to rent a theater, pay dancers, cover costume materials, hire visual artists and rent space for rehearsals. Not to mention we were also able to collaborate with Horsegod Productions on film and improvisational projection during the performances. Our first show was a success due to your support. So what's next for NAB? Well...</p>

</ul>Remember we can't do this without you, so thank you and see you at the shows that you made happen! </div></div>","Hello, 

I am Lucy Warren-Whitman, the Artistic Director of North Atlantic dance Theatre (formerly known as North Atlantic Ballet).  As we are beginning preparations for our 2015 season, we at North Atlantic Dance Theatre have been tasked with the chore of raising funds for this season's performances and we are in need of your support. 
Who are we?
North Atlantic Dance Theatre  is a collaborative dance company challenging audiences with emotionally charged performances. We offer smaller classical ballets that are rarely seen and present audiences with the opportunity to embrace these powerful stories and become enchanted by them. We also nurture and encourage Dancers, Choreographers, Musicians, and Visual Artists to use the company as a platform to mold their talents and ideas; to create innovative and visually stimulating performances for our audiences and artist communities. 
North Atlantic Dance Theatre performed Vivaldi's Four seasons in September. This was made possible by supporters like you, making donations to our ""Let's get this party started"" Indiegogo fundraiser. The funds we raised made it possible for us to rent a theater, pay dancers, cover costume materials, hire visual artists and rent space for rehearsals. Not to mention we were also able to collaborate with Horsegod Productions on film and improvisational projection during the performances. Our first show was a success due to your support. So what's next for NAB? Well...





Scheherazade :  A mystical tale of passion, betrayal and love’s conquests. The 1001 Arabian nights comes alive through the storytelling of Scheherazade. Unlike most stage productions this story begins with Scheherazade’s arrival as the Sultan's newest bride. Her daring  struggle for her survival depends on her skill in storytelling and keeping the Sultan enthralled night after night for 1001 nights; less she be murdered as all the brides were fated before her. Her single act of bravery saves the lives of countless women as she teaches the Sultan the power of love and forgiveness. This production includes a collaboration with local Artists and musicians. By recreating a prologue through Anime while the stories come alive around the theater. Anime. live music and Dance that comes alive in the audience. Yes please.



Choreographer's Collective : 3 voices, 3 ideas, 3 new original ballets. Three local choreographers will share their vision with the company creating new works for NADT. This will be a great opportunity for dancers and emerging choreographers. We will be joined by One established choreographer, one up & coming, and one ambitious new choreographer.

Why should you help?

""If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him.""
-John F. Kennedy

The life of a company relies mainly on donations from supporters, such as yourself. Your donation helps to give North Atlantic Dance Theatre the freedom to be creative without the weight of cost hindering our creative process. Myself and many other dancers have spent the better part of our lives in pursuit of dance, we have struggled to find a place to dance, built on the integrity of their creative achievements.  This is no small endeavor.  The dancers at North Atlantic Dance Theatre have been clamoring for this kind of place, a home, a safe haven. A place here they can pour their heart and soul into every performance and share it with you: 
Our supporters. 
And with your support, North Atlantic Dance Theatre will be that home. We offer new ideas with lots of energy, a sense of community, and an urge to collaborate with other artists to keep our art form fresh, but we need your support to help these ideas become realities.

It requires the full-time attention and nourishment from its leaders. Not only is it an around-the-clock job, it comes with big expenses. Backed with a great business plan, we now need the funds to bring life to our project. To aid in achieving our goal, we are following the example of many successful start-ups by using crowdfunding to spread the word and gather capital for Empyrean Arts. Raising awareness and interest is one of the biggest benefits of this approach, and will help greatly in getting our feet on the ground. While crowdfunding gives us a platform to share our story with our audience, it also gives our supporters the opportunity to be an important part of our building process. </p><p>After months of developing and refining our business plan and expenses, we have calculated that we need to raise around $20,000 to open our doors. We are aiming to raise a large portion of that through crowdfunding. We have constructed a pie chart to clarify where contributions will be going (check it out below!). In return for your support, we have come up with some awesome perks. To name a few: your name on a permanent art installation displayed in the studio, autographed photos of the Empyrean team, studio time through classes, private lessons, and parties, and even professional aerial performances. While we realize $20,000 is a large number, we plan to move ahead with our business plan, even if we do not fully reach our goal. In that case, the funds will still be divided into the outlined expenses in smaller amounts.</p><p></p><p>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1277047/files/20150307192749-pie_chart.png?1425785269"" src="""" style=""width: 592.8070175438596px; height: 436px;""/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The point...</h3><p></p><p>Aside from our desire to build a business where we can earn income through our passion for teaching movement arts, the amount of local and regional interest in a business like ours is tremendous, and regularly expressed. Individual members of the Empyrean team are constantly responding to inquiries about when and where a space like the one we intend to create will exist. Our goal is to get up and running within two months of completing our crowdfunding campaign. In the meantime, hang in there with us! Help spread the word about the campaign, tell your friends about Empyrean, and introduce people to us who share your excitement. People in our area are ready to learn incredible arts such as aerial dance trapeze and pole fitness, as well as the many other classes we are prepared to offer. </p>

We don't believe it will take long for people to want to be a part of the encouraging and enriching environment we promise to create, but we are realistic that obtaining sufficient start-up capital is a big hurdle. Even our crowdfunding campaign is an expense (that expense shrinks drastically if we meet our 20K goal, though!). We have well-organized and exciting lesson plans for classes, a solid marketing plan for attracting new customers, and highly-trained instructors to cater to a wide variety of students.  We are more than positive that we have a winning formula on our hands.

A few of the classes we will offer include pole fitness, contortion, aerial dance trapeze, strength and conditioning, ballet, and partner yoga. Our biggest goal is to make people feel good about themselves in a fun and supportive environment. We at Empyrean believe it is possible for anyone to find joy and creativity in fitness through movement art (yes, that means you!).                                Waverly Jones, Empyrean Arts owner, and Dakota Fox, Aradia Fitness USA ownerLet's get down to business...Opening a small business is a challenge. It requires the full-time attention and nourishment from its leaders. Not only is it an around-the-clock job, it comes with big expenses. Backed with a great business plan, we now need the funds to bring life to our project. To aid in achieving our goal, we are following the example of many successful start-ups by using crowdfunding to spread the word and gather capital for Empyrean Arts. Raising awareness and interest is one of the biggest benefits of this approach, and will help greatly in getting our feet on the ground. While crowdfunding gives us a platform to share our story with our audience, it also gives our supporters the opportunity to be an important part of our building process. After months of developing and refining our business plan and expenses, we have calculated that we need to raise around $20,000 to open our doors. We are aiming to raise a large portion of that through crowdfunding. We have constructed a pie chart to clarify where contributions will be going (check it out below!). In return for your support, we have come up with some awesome perks. To name a few: your name on a permanent art installation displayed in the studio, autographed photos of the Empyrean team, studio time through classes, private lessons, and parties, and even professional aerial performances. While we realize $20,000 is a large number, we plan to move ahead with our business plan, even if we do not fully reach our goal. In that case, the funds will still be divided into the outlined expenses in smaller amounts.    The point...Aside from our desire to build a business where we can earn income through our passion for teaching movement arts, the amount of local and regional interest in a business like ours is tremendous, and regularly expressed. Individual members of the Empyrean team are constantly responding to inquiries about when and where a space like the one we intend to create will exist. Our goal is to get up and running within two months of completing our crowdfunding campaign. In the meantime, hang in there with us! Help spread the word about the campaign, tell your friends about Empyrean, and introduce people to us who share your excitement. People in our area are ready to learn incredible arts such as aerial dance trapeze and pole fitness, as well as the many other classes we are prepared to offer. 
                                   April Skelton, Empyrean Arts InstructorWhat are we up against?We will be the only studio that offers pole fitness and aerial dance within an almost two hour radius. We have an opportunity to rise to the top and put ourselves on the map. While financial success is important, we want to make clear that we require for ourselves a safe and healthy studio to practice, and will provide our future students with the same. We don't believe it will take long for people to want to be a part of the encouraging and enriching environment we promise to create, but we are realistic that obtaining sufficient start-up capital is a big hurdle. Even our crowdfunding campaign is an expense (that expense shrinks drastically if we meet our 20K goal, though!). We have well-organized and exciting lesson plans for classes, a solid marketing plan for attracting new customers, and highly-trained instructors to cater to a wide variety of students.  We are more than positive that we have a winning formula on our hands. Understanding that many businesses spend their early years just trying to break even, we are prepared to hang tight when times are tough. We are fully dedicated to Empyrean Arts as a business we believe in.                 Dana Breen, Empyrean Arts Instructor Ways you can help make it happen:To stay in touch and receive updates about Empyrean Arts, please subscribe to our mailing list at EmpyreanArts.org.

That's why we <b>keep our tickets free </b>when possible, and low-cost when not. </p><p>•Truthful Acting- Humans being humans on a stage. That’s what we’re most interested in.<br/><br/>•Getting Up Close and Too Personal- We like intimate spaces. We think too much space gives the audience an out.<br/><br/>•Stories Worth Telling- Shakespeare. Shanley. New work. Old work.

On the other hand, it only takes a mere $10,000 to provide free theatre to the people of Chicago.</p><ul>
<li>Money raised will be used to pay for theatre and rehearsal space rental, paying actors and technicians, props, costumes, skulls, set, marketing, insurance, and probably something expensive we haven't even imagined yet, but will surprise and horrify us. </li>
<li>In addition to making theatre available to everyone, and being an awesome do-gooder, we're also offering several acknowledgement perks, including unique puppet videos! </li>
<li>In the event of not raising enough funds, the money will be used to buy handkerchiefs to wipe away our tears. Just kidding. It will be part of the Accomplice Theatre fund at Fractured Atlas, available to be used for future projects. </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>It costs a lot of money to go see theatre in Chicago. Oh sure, there's Shakespeare in the park, but if you want to go to a dedicated theatre space and see a play, it can get pretty costly pretty quickly. Even small companies are routinely charging $25 and upwards for tickets. We understand why: it's expensive to produce theatre. But costly tickets make theatre a special treat, or even a complete impossibility for many people. </p><ul>
<li>Removing cost is removing a barrier to the arts. </li>
<li>The capacity of the space we'll perform in, and our month-long run, give us the potential to share our production with more than 1,000 people. </li>
<li>By removing (or lowering) the factor of ticket price, everyone is included equally. We're all in it together.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>The biggest risk and challenge we anticipate is raising enough funds. There. We said it. We're counting on you, and absolutely can't do it without a lot of help. </p><p>However, another challenge we're anticipating is getting the word out that there's free (or low-cost, depending on how much money we raise) theatre available. If we build it, we think there may be a few more steps before they come to the show. Figuring out how to advertise, who to talk to, and how to invite the audience will be exciting, but also tricky. We have the opportunity and the space for many people--we want to make sure we make the most of it. </p><ul>
<li>We plan to reach out to community organizations, senior housing, youth organizations, and community leaders, to build our audience.</li>
<li>If we do not raise enough funds to do the show for free, we will offer low-cost tickets.</li>
<li>If we do not raise enough funds to do the show at all, we will continue to fundraise until we can. Or we will do something else equally important, but not as expensive. </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We all get a lot of these requests, and can't always contribute. We get it, we're broke artists. However, you can still help us out by:</p><ul>
<li>Getting the word out. Share our campaign, tell your friends about us, or join our fundraising team!</li>
<li>If you live in Chicago, and want to work on the nitty-gritty bits of production and/or fundraising, get in touch. We have envelopes to stuff, and tickets to take, and street teaming to do!</li>

<p>Dance Wisconsin believes in possibilities.   Chelsey Bradley’s new 
work, “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” proves it!   We have an 
exceptional choreographic story, talented dancers, dedicated volunteers,
 and experienced artistic and production staff ready to roll.   But, to 
complete our vision, we need financial support. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Established in 1999, Dance Wisconsin is a 
501(c) 3 non-profit, dance company that offers exceptional dance 
training and educational opportunities to south-central Wisconsin
 residents. The company consists of fifteen dancers ages twelve to 
adult. Members travel from McFarland, Madison, Monona, Sun Prairie, 
Marshall, Lake Mills, Waunakee, and New Glarus to train with the 
company.   Audiences of diverse ethnicity, ages, and arts interests will 
be served, as well as emerging dancers and costumers.  There are few 
opportunities for youth and young adults to work with skilled and 
talented dancers, to craft choreography, design costumes, work with 
stage crew, and perform original works in front of an audience.   Dance 
Wisconsin gives young artists the space, time, instruction, and guidance
 to explore the ARTS.  This production provides local choreographers the
 means to craft and present original dance; dancers the opportunity to 
explore working with others, props, and visual projections; and 
costumers to create new designs.</p>

Dance Wisconsin believes in possibilities.   Chelsey Bradley’s new 
work, “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” proves it!   We have an 
exceptional choreographic story, talented dancers, dedicated volunteers,
 and experienced artistic and production staff ready to roll.   But, to 
complete our vision, we need financial support. 

Established in 1999, Dance Wisconsin is a 
501(c) 3 non-profit, dance company that offers exceptional dance 
training and educational opportunities to south-central Wisconsin
 residents. The company consists of fifteen dancers ages twelve to 
adult. Members travel from McFarland, Madison, Monona, Sun Prairie, 
Marshall, Lake Mills, Waunakee, and New Glarus to train with the 
company.   Audiences of diverse ethnicity, ages, and arts interests will 
be served, as well as emerging dancers and costumers.  There are few 
opportunities for youth and young adults to work with skilled and 
talented dancers, to craft choreography, design costumes, work with 
stage crew, and perform original works in front of an audience.   Dance 
Wisconsin gives young artists the space, time, instruction, and guidance
 to explore the ARTS.  This production provides local choreographers the
 means to craft and present original dance; dancers the opportunity to 
explore working with others, props, and visual projections; and 
costumers to create new designs.


What We Need




Can you imagine Wonderland without life-sized playing cards? Neither 
can we! This campaign will support all production expenses ranging from 
original choreography, costumes, props, lighting design, set design, and
 everything else that happens behind-the-scenes.  
Campaign perks 
begin at as low as $10, and include signed t-shirts, tickets to the 
show, and the opportunity to have your name listed in the ""Alice in 
Wonderland"" program.

Play a role in contributing to history and community! The National Historic Register, the official list of historic places worthy of preservation in the U.S., states that the theatre is ""an important property in the development of Ludlow, especially within that city's entertainment culture"" and ""provides a strong example of the central role movie theaters played in small towns across the country during the movie boom following the Second World War.""

Win recognition at the theatre with your name on a plaque to signify your contribution, whether you helped light the building or build the marquee. 

Take pride in creating local jobs and supporting local businesses. We practice sourcing locally whenever possible by hiring artisans in the community and customizing our circus props and theatre signs from metal and machine shops such as Bluegrass Iron Works and Spati Industries in Ludlow and Steidle Fabricating in Bromley. The marquee and other restorations will be sourced in the area for economic growth and development .

Since the purchase of the Ludlow Theatre in 2009, Ludlow welcomed 12 new businesses: AER Group, 319 Linden Street, (859) 577-5007 ; Circus Mojo, 322 Elm Street, (859) 360-7757; 230 Elm Antiques & Vintage, 230 Elm Street, (513) 368-9943; Folk School Coffee Parlor, 332 Elm Street, (859) 206-1269; Jeff & John Winkle Studio, 329 Elm Street; The Lagoon Saloon, 859 Elm Street, (859) 581-7822; Pizza Hut, 102 Elm Street, (859) 261-6111; Riverside Marketplace, 106 Elm Street, (859) 292-0442; Second Sights Spirits, 301 B Elm Street; Subway, 478 Elm Street, (859) 415-0772; Trendy Treasures, 243 Elm Street, (859) 380-5862; and Wynner’s Cup Cafe, 301 A Elm Street, (859) 912-5806. 
Once the Ludlow Theatre is restored, even more businesses, customers and residents will help make this quaint river town a thriving community.      

 Challenges for Cast & Crew

Meeting our deadline. In 2013 we secured a spot on the National Historic Register and received State and Federal Historic Tax Credits that expire December of 2015 in the sum of $59,979.06, funds not to be wasted.
Budgeting time and money to bring the theatre up to date on current codes. 
Coordinating with city and zoning officials to realize our vision.

<div>My name is Kaitlin Overton and I am the creator, director, and one of the producers of the Solitude House Theatre Project. I am also a co-founder of the new theatre company No Dominion Theatre Co. with Michael Joel; Michael is my co-producer on this project and also an actor in the piece. We founded this company with a fellow college classmate, Aryana Sedarati, in the hopes of creating new, original theatre that means something both to us and to the world. That is what we aim to do with this new piece as well: what is currently unofficially titled the Solitude House Theatre Project.</div>
<div>What is the Solitude House Theatre Project? Great question! This project is the development process for what will become an original devised theatre piece produced by No Dominion Theatre Co. The performance will take place at the historic Solitude House in High Bridge, New Jersey on November 7th, 8th, 14th, and 15th of 2015. The show itself draws from interviews conducted with the community of High Bridge, NJ and already-existing works such as The Cherry Orchard and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov, as well as poetry selections by Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau; the final product will be a performance that utilizes all of these texts and explores the ideas of hometown, moving, and what it really means to find your place in the world. </div>
<div>This campaign will fund costs for this project but also future costs of our theatre company. It is crucial we are able to fund all of our projects. Costs for this project include compensation for all actors and the creative team, production costs such as costumes, set pieces, and props, and advertising materials: fliers, postcards, and business cards for the company. It means a lot to us as budding theatre creators that we will be able to fund this project as well as compensate our actors and creative team for all of their time and efforts.</div>
<div>By contributing to this project, you will truly be helping us produce this show. Independent theatre and new theatre companies are really on the up and up and you will be helping this piece be a part of the independent theatre community. How cool is that?! Knowing that you believe is us and in our work truly means the world to us. </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our goal for this project is $4500. Here is exactly where those funds will be going:</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>The type of theatre we do is unique; it is new and raw and original and takes risks. This specific production is also happening in the heart of my hometown, something that is new for both me as a theatre creator and producer but also to the community of High Bridge, New Jersey. I am lucky to have gotten this amazing opportunity to rehearse and perform in the historic Solitude House and bring my theatre company to this awesome site and do theatre here. The arts scene in High Bridge is constantly growing and I am grateful and thrilled to be contributing to it. By contributing to this campaign, you are also contributing to the development of fine arts in High Bridge, New Jersey!</div>
<div>Our first production as a theatre company, One. Four. (Zero). by Michael Joel, also took place in Solitude House back in May of 2015. It was very well received by the community; we got lots of positivie feedback and had a great turn out. We are excited to bring more people in to see this piece and take what we learned from that production and apply it to this one!</div>
<div>Back in the winter of 2014-2015, I approached the High Bridge Town Council about using Solitude House as the performance venue for this piece, and they approved my proposal and idea for this theatre project. Now the performance is only a few months away! It is amazing how much support we have already gotten from the community and we are so excited about this Indiegogo campaign and the time we spend rehearsing together for this production! November will be here before we know it!</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>With every theatrical endeavor comes risks and challenges; will anyone come to the show? Will people care about the material? Will people understand what the show is about? As actors, directors, and producers, we understand these questions and have asked them all our lives and throughout our college careers as theatre students. We can't always predict the future and answer these questions prematurely, but we have the tools and knowledge to work towards the answers of those questions being 'Yes.'</p>
<p>Social media is a huge advertising tool these days, and one that we constantly use to promote our work and projects. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram... we're on all of them! And we have a website where you can view photos and read more about us as a theatre company and what we are working on: <a href=""http://www.nodominiontheatre.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nodominiontheatre.org</a>. Word of mouth is also extremely helpful! As is advertising with lots of signage around the town as well as postcards and fliers to draw attention to the details of the performance.</p>
<p>As for the performance itself, we all went to school for theatre so we all know that the beginning of a productions is difficult: where to start with the script, who will be reading which lines, etc. This is why we have been having rehearsals during the past few months and workshops in order to learn more about this show ourselves. It is still in its baby stages, but eventually it will grow and develop into a final product and you will get to see it in November!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you aren't able to contribute, no problem! There are still plenty of ways you can help this project reach its goal</p> <ul> <li>Talk about us! Either via word of mouth, email, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram...we love the attention!

It is still in its baby stages, but eventually it will grow and develop into a final product and you will get to see it in November!

Either via word of mouth, email, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram...we love the attention! And it will truly help get the word spread about this project!

It is organized by Atropos Theatre company which for the past 5 years has been organizing theatrical and anthropological projects and expeditions in different communities in Europe and Asia, as well as performances and short workshops. </p>
<p>This time the idea is to invite four teachers with different backgrounds and cultures, who will lead 4 workshops during one week, and in the end to gather all material and make a performance under the direction of Stamatis Efstathiou, Atropos artistic director. All the team will live in tents and work outdoors, share simple conditions, cook and eat together. </p>
<p>The possibility to take distance from the city and from the temptations of civilization is a timeless idea of working frame of Atropos theatre. The essence of this idea is that the actor-researcher devotes himself to creative training in a daily, undistracted and intensive basis. At the same time, Atropos invites external masters from different parts of the world, who develop their own independent path and share as basic philosophy the research, the constant training and the spiritual dimension of art, far away from the industry of entertainment. </p>

But the Joy is also important to the local economy and quality of life. It appeals to people who want to buy homes in the area.

A Labor of Love, Baby!Simple fact #1: Nobody gets rich running a one-screen, second-run theatre. Simple fact #2: You'll never regret doing something you love. 


Balancing these realities has been the key to our success thus far. The need to be careful with money, in fact, has driven us to be more creative and resourceful. The look of our lobby, our decor, and our onscreen pre-show were all created by members of our staff. 


Hard work, running a tight ship and a love for what we do have gotten the Joy away from the brink and back on track. Wiping out the debt taken on in our digital upgrade will ensure that we can stay open for years and keep getting better at what we do.

See what people had to see about our provocative show at NSDF below: Winner of the Sunday Times New Playwriting Award 2015 ""a violent assault on our senses and sensibilities"" -The Times-The party's over nowNow we have been invited to attend Incoming festival hosted by The New Diorama Theatre in London on the 9th of June. Promising to be a showcase of the best of emerging theatre making from across the country this is an exciting opportunity for us before we take on the challenge of a week long run at the world’s largest theatre festival, The Edinburgh Fringe.  We are so thrilled by the opportunities we’ve been provided this summer and we hope to continue making exciting provocative work for more people to see but we simply cannot do this without your helpAha now we get the point eh, why you need my help?Exactly, well not really because you’re still just a paragraph with bold type but the lovely people who’ve read this far.We need your support because as students our resources have been stretched to breaking point even getting this far. Up until this point we’ve been able to get funding together for our own shows but we are approaching a stage where we cannot rely on reviews and goodwill to get us any further. Marketing, Travel, accommodation and equipment maintenance will all exact a heavy toll on our resources over the busy summer we have ahead of us and any contribution your are able to make, large or small, would be much appreciated.Find out more in The little book of ANGRY",3.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Congregation </b></p>
<p>Last year, with the help of our Indiegogo supporters, Boston’s Fire Performance troupe returned to the playa for the first time in six years.  This year we are
looking to go even bigger for our second annual fire show to represent Boston
during the ceremonial performance. </p>
<p><b>What is
Burning Man?</b></p>
<p>Burning man is an annual event that happens in the Black Rock Desert (called the playa).  It is a temporary settlement made to resemble a city that is
filled with interactive art, music and fire installations.  The event lasts for eight days, and
many people attend for a spiritual retreat and artistic expressive revival.</p>
<p><b>When do you
perform?</b></p>
<p>Every year at Burning Man, fire groups from around the world
perform their own choreographed ceremonial dance in celebration and in
dedication to the honor of the ""Man"" prior to it being burned to the
ground. This is the largest convergence of fire performers in the world and it is an
honor to participate in. </p>
<p>Incineration
Congregation has a dedicated group of fire
spinners from the Boston area to perform their unique vision on playa.  Currently, our group consists of over forty individuals that are fire
performers, drummers, choreographers, fire safeties, and videographers. </p>
<p><b>Information
about Boston’s Incineration Congregation</b></p>
<p>Last year’s performance consisted of an elaborate theme of good
versus evil that included partner acrobatic fire spinning, a fire sword and
rope dart fight scene, and an array of other fire props, costumes and
performance groups. This year the event's theme is 'Carnival of Mirrors' and
we have already begun planning the best and most creative way to execute our
performance in coordination with the theme.  </p>

My name is Brendan Drake. Under the umbrella of my company Brendan Drake Choreography, I fuse contrasting genres, humor and theatricality to create stylized performance spectacles.


A little over a year ago, I launched my first crowdfunding effort and managed to raise $2,000 of seed money for my company’s general operations. With those funds,  I premiered work at Dixon Place, the Wild Project and Triskelion Arts Center, enjoyed a residency at MANA Contemporary and have been commissioned to create new work on students at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. 
NOT BAD FOR JUST A YEAR
In addition, I also plunged head first into the world of fashion, acting as movement coordinator for over 14 editorial shoots - working with Cate Blanchette, Lorde, Elle & Porter Magazines and choreographed the fall 2014 campaign for Adidas Originals/Pharrall Williams which can be seen here.
CURIOUS YET?
I was also able to begin work on ROPE, which had its developmental premiere at Gowanus Loft Brooklyn in March 2015. I am so excited to continue expanding ROPE into an evening length production after being awarded a generous grant by the CUNY Dance Initiative at Baruch College which allows me phenomenal rehearsal space at no expense to me personally. 

WHAT IS ROPE?
Inspired by the camp of Hollywood Film noir and the closeted gay experience, Rope is a work for four dancers that creates a correlation between homosexual innuendo and villainy.
NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION
I am so excited to be premiering a BIGGER, BADDER version of ROPE through a fabulous opportunity at HERE. 
This production is a part of SubletSeries@HERE: Co-op, HERE's curated rental program, which provides artists with subsidized space and equipment, as well as technical support.
ROPE has been a passion project of mine for the past year and I want it produced in a very real way.  Funds raised from this campaign will go towards:



Technical and General Management


More Advanced Marketing Efforts


Press Materials


Adequate Compensation for the All Involved with the Production 


Additionally, the goal of this fundraiser is to create ticket sales at the box office which will in turn create funds for me to move forward with ROPE and future projects. In a sense, this is more of an investment opportunity in my company, and me, than a fundraiser.
 Brendan Drake Choreography is a proud fiscally sponsored 501(c)3 non-profit organization through Fractured Atlas. I cannot stress enough the importance your contribution makes to the success of this production and my career.

</blockquote><p><b>Philip Ridley</b> is a unanimously lauded playwright from the UK, whose work kickstarted the in-yer-face theatre movement scene of the 1990'swhich included writers like Mark Ravenhill and Sarah Kane; Phil has arguably emerged the leader of the movement, who continues to produce startling work every year which wins rave reviews, critical and audience acclaim, and has achieved cult status. His work has been produced in piecemeal in the United States, with audiences clamouring for more.</p><p></p><p>In August 2015, the New Group, NYC, presented Ridley's shocking play <b>Mercury Fur</b>, and New York audiences reacted with enthusiasm to the new setting of their own city:</p><blockquote>
<i>""Mercury Fur is a profoundly moral play...the play's stunningly indeterminate ending leaves you moved, muddled and gasping for air""    </i><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The New York Times on <b>Mercury Fur</b>, August 2015</span>
</blockquote><p></p><p>In 2013 Ridley opened <b>Dark Vanilla Jungle</b> in Edinburgh, which transferred to London to great acclaim, and <b>Tonight with Donny Stixx </b>was completed and premiered summer 2015 at the Edinburgh Festival - this is the first global production since then. This is also the first time these companion pieces have been presented and created together, and it is a US debut for both pieces. Ridley is a valued friend of Frances Loy and supports the project as a cohesive piece, giving it its combination name <b>TONIGHT/JUNGLE</b>.</p><p>On January 21st 2016, both shows will open at the Here Arts Center in NYC and run in rep - Frances will direct Harry Farmer as Donny, and Paul will direct Robyn Kerr as Andrea, shared design team, made up of Steven Kemp (set), Dante Olivia Smith (lights) and Toby Algya (sound) will create a cohesive stage in which to explore these visceral, lyrical pieces, staged side by side and created with a shared creative vision, for an audience eager to see work that pulls viciously on their heart strings by way of ripping out their guts.</p><p> The production will then transfer to Los Angeles later in 2016.</p><p>This campaign is being created by <b>Ferment Theatre</b>, the LA based producers, covering half the production costs of the entire project for both New York and Los Angeles, and is being run by Artistic Director Frances Loy, Producer Belinda Gosbee, and Associate Producers Jillian Barba, Jeff Mitchell and Tom Curitore.</p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Money Money Money</h3><p><i>We are fundraising for our part of the full production budget, which totals $30,000</i>.

We are firm believers that even in this industry in which we toil for love, we owe it to our colleagues to lead the way in providing more than a glass of wine at the end of the run. These are professionals who deserve to be  compensated for their talent, dedication and dogged determination to create incredible theatre</p><p>- flights for the LA team to fly to New York, and our share of the design team's flights to LA - it would be a shame to raise the fees for the team only to make them spend it on their travel!</p><p>- our half of the set and costumes budget</p><p>- space hire/development in Los Angeles</p><p>- performance rights for Los Angeles</p><p>- our half of all press and marketing costs. This is arguably the area in which we just can't cut the costs, in order to get the reach to the audiences we want, and to get the all important critic in the room, we have to pay (again, the professionals) the people who can make this happen. HAVE NO FEAR we shall still be utilizing every creative free way of spreading the word, please help by utilising all your social media outlets!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Frances Loy: Why this piece, now, why me?</h3><p>I worked pretty tirelessly on the London theatre circuit for several years, juggling menial paid jobs with incredible directing experiences, co-founding and running an acclaimed alternative space theatre company and somehow keeping two small humans alive in the process. Three years ago our family moved to America where I was given the downtrodden visa status H4 - leave to remain but not to work. While it has been wonderful to have had the opportunity to be with my children, I have seriously missed my work, my community. My confidence over whether I could even run a rehearsal room again was at rock bottom, until someone recently gave me the chance to prove myself again. With the reforged love for my craft, along with a very handy Green Card (Thanks Obama!), this project was born and it is literally my blood and guts and heart and life running through it.</p><p>I have long adored Phil's work; I mounted the first major London revival of Mercury Fur in 2010, to critical acclaim and sell-out audiences; he has remained a valued friend and I have been biding my time for the right place, space and moment to return to his work again.</p><p>Both <b>TONIGHT WITH DONNY STIXX</b> and <b>DARK VANILLA JUNGLE</b> are incredible stand alone pieces that speak to the darkest reaches of human experience, in the wonderfully macabre but poetical way that Phil has. These young people have everything thrown at them and yet they continue to strive to be the best they can be, to survive and find love and acceptance, a connection. Ultimately society wins, and they fail, but not without leaving an audience full of conflicted feelings of abhorrence and empathy. These are everypeople, very much depicting the consistent failure of our most vulnerable young people, people whose tragic loss of worth and potential happens every single day. They are comments on underage sex trafficking, gun crime, grief, mental illness, illusion, perception, obsession, socio-economic stigma. But most of all, they are two people, two sides of the same coin, just trying to connect to something real, yet only managing to survive by becoming completely enveloped by their fantasy lives. There is never NOT a time to be staging this production.</p><p>For me, the timing could not be more fated and serendipitous: I'm so excited to be creating this project with Paul Takacs, a New York based American director, who has also found great success directing Phil's work before now. Paul initially intended to mount <b>DARK VANILLA JUNGLE</b> over a year ago - it just seems too coincidental that life circumstances forced him to delay until, unbeknown to him, I was finally ready to work again and Phil was about to complete <b>TONIGHT WITH DONNY STIXX</b>. We have a shared vision for what a rep production of these two pieces can give an audience prepared to have them both laid bare before them, and are committed to creating a cohesive design that seamlessly transports us between and within these two worlds. </p><p>We're also incredibly lucky to be following close on the heels of a highly successful run of <b>MERCURY FUR</b> by the New Group in NYC - it feels like America is on the cusp of embracing Philip Ridley, and to have this opportunity to share his work and to provide a platform for it is wonderful. It's also creating fabulous opportunities for our actors, stage managers and designers to be able to showcase their work in two such opposing but equally important and dynamic cities in America...everyone is on board with this production and truly excited about what it beholds for us all.</p><p></p><h3>What if?....</h3><p>When we first decided to go ahead with this show, Paul threw ""Spring"" around as potential timeline....only a few months ago he found the perfect venue in NYC, the problem being the dates are much sooner than anticipated. I don't deny the overwhelming fear of failure is never far away - how to raise this much money in such a short amount of time particularly when Christmas is fast approaching. The very day we agreed to bite the bullet and go for it, even though it's going to be by the skin of our teeth, I was mid meltdown when a dear friend called me for a pep talk...the first thing he said was ""What happens if you don't do it?"" I didn't have an answer for him; I haven't once considered that this may not happen. Somehow we will find a way, basically it can't NOT happen - there is already too much love, commitment and passion being poured into this project. Every single cent will bring us closer to realising it, and for that, we are truly grateful.</p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Please share the hell out of our campaign - we are giving ourselves such a short amount of time to raise what feels to us like a huge sum of money, and while we're under no illusions that this will be the new pebble watch and go viral, there may be someone you know who thinks ""sure, it's worth chucking $10 I found in my car glove compartment at them""...every. cent. helps.....</p><p>THANKYOU!!!</p><p></p></div>","Coast to Coast Theatre Collaboration of UK and US Artists Two directors, separated by an ocean and a continent, discover the raw poetry of a genius cult writer, they produce his work to great acclaim in their home cities, and look ahead to turning his poetic words again into live performance.

We are firm believers that even in this industry in which we toil for love, we owe it to our colleagues to lead the way in providing more than a glass of wine at the end of the run. These are professionals who deserve to be  compensated for their talent, dedication and dogged determination to create incredible theatre- flights for the LA team to fly to New York, and our share of the design team's flights to LA - it would be a shame to raise the fees for the team only to make them spend it on their travel!- our half of the set and costumes budget- space hire/development in Los Angeles- performance rights for Los Angeles- our half of all press and marketing costs. This is arguably the area in which we just can't cut the costs, in order to get the reach to the audiences we want, and to get the all important critic in the room, we have to pay (again, the professionals) the people who can make this happen. HAVE NO FEAR we shall still be utilizing every creative free way of spreading the word, please help by utilising all your social media outlets!Frances Loy: Why this piece, now, why me?I worked pretty tirelessly on the London theatre circuit for several years, juggling menial paid jobs with incredible directing experiences, co-founding and running an acclaimed alternative space theatre company and somehow keeping two small humans alive in the process. Three years ago our family moved to America where I was given the downtrodden visa status H4 - leave to remain but not to work. While it has been wonderful to have had the opportunity to be with my children, I have seriously missed my work, my community. My confidence over whether I could even run a rehearsal room again was at rock bottom, until someone recently gave me the chance to prove myself again. With the reforged love for my craft, along with a very handy Green Card (Thanks Obama!), this project was born and it is literally my blood and guts and heart and life running through it.I have long adored Phil's work; I mounted the first major London revival of Mercury Fur in 2010, to critical acclaim and sell-out audiences; he has remained a valued friend and I have been biding my time for the right place, space and moment to return to his work again.Both TONIGHT WITH DONNY STIXX and DARK VANILLA JUNGLE are incredible stand alone pieces that speak to the darkest reaches of human experience, in the wonderfully macabre but poetical way that Phil has. These young people have everything thrown at them and yet they continue to strive to be the best they can be, to survive and find love and acceptance, a connection. Ultimately society wins, and they fail, but not without leaving an audience full of conflicted feelings of abhorrence and empathy. These are everypeople, very much depicting the consistent failure of our most vulnerable young people, people whose tragic loss of worth and potential happens every single day. They are comments on underage sex trafficking, gun crime, grief, mental illness, illusion, perception, obsession, socio-economic stigma. But most of all, they are two people, two sides of the same coin, just trying to connect to something real, yet only managing to survive by becoming completely enveloped by their fantasy lives. There is never NOT a time to be staging this production.For me, the timing could not be more fated and serendipitous: I'm so excited to be creating this project with Paul Takacs, a New York based American director, who has also found great success directing Phil's work before now. Paul initially intended to mount DARK VANILLA JUNGLE over a year ago - it just seems too coincidental that life circumstances forced him to delay until, unbeknown to him, I was finally ready to work again and Phil was about to complete TONIGHT WITH DONNY STIXX. We have a shared vision for what a rep production of these two pieces can give an audience prepared to have them both laid bare before them, and are committed to creating a cohesive design that seamlessly transports us between and within these two worlds. We're also incredibly lucky to be following close on the heels of a highly successful run of MERCURY FUR by the New Group in NYC - it feels like America is on the cusp of embracing Philip Ridley, and to have this opportunity to share his work and to provide a platform for it is wonderful. It's also creating fabulous opportunities for our actors, stage managers and designers to be able to showcase their work in two such opposing but equally important and dynamic cities in America...everyone is on board with this production and truly excited about what it beholds for us all.What if?....When we first decided to go ahead with this show, Paul threw ""Spring"" around as potential timeline....only a few months ago he found the perfect venue in NYC, the problem being the dates are much sooner than anticipated. I don't deny the overwhelming fear of failure is never far away - how to raise this much money in such a short amount of time particularly when Christmas is fast approaching. The very day we agreed to bite the bullet and go for it, even though it's going to be by the skin of our teeth, I was mid meltdown when a dear friend called me for a pep talk...the first thing he said was ""What happens if you don't do it?"" I didn't have an answer for him; I haven't once considered that this may not happen. Somehow we will find a way, basically it can't NOT happen - there is already too much love, commitment and passion being poured into this project. Every single cent will bring us closer to realising it, and for that, we are truly grateful.Other Ways You Can HelpPlease share the hell out of our campaign - we are giving ourselves such a short amount of time to raise what feels to us like a huge sum of money, and while we're under no illusions that this will be the new pebble watch and go viral, there may be someone you know who thinks ""sure, it's worth chucking $10 I found in my car glove compartment at them""...every. cent. helps.....THANKYOU!!!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I have been dancing for years upon years and finally settled into full on creation mode in Atlanta circa 2014. And to keep my stage game on point, I still continue to perform as often as I can with many talented local choreographers.</p>

<p><b>Bits and Chunks</b></p>
<p></p>Bits and Chunks is a movement narrative about the inner grotesque. It is a physical representation of neurotic manifestations; anxiety, anger, jealousy, rage, lust, control. As repulsive or unacceptable as these states can be, they are inherently human and reside, to some degree, in each of us. Where it gets gritty and personal is in the choices we make to acknowledge, accept, repress, or indulge in the ecstasy of emotional submersion. What I've found through my own experiences is that to acknowledge the neurosis is to make space for the beast; to mollify the monster. Without the grotesque, the ugly, the frightening, how can we recognize and appreciate that which is beautiful, gentle, and serene? </div><div>Take away the ugly and perhaps all that remains is tedious geniality.

<div>I want to transport you, the audience, to a state of mind crowded with a lot of messy emotions.

Maybe you love the decor or maybe you leave thinking, ""Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, better her than me."" Either way, we will have experienced an intentional moment of shared reality and nothing would make me happier.  </div>
<div>So to make all this magic happen I have enlisted a crew of dancers and a maker of masks to shape the visual landscape, and these people deserve millions of dollars for their effort and artistry. Lucky for you, we shall be asking for generous donations of a much more reasonable sum and in return you'll receive a special gift to commemorate our collaboration.

It will cover several mission-critical expenses including: theater and rehearsal facility rental as well as salaries for the director and a key designer. Here's a pie chart that breaks down the project's expenses by percentage.… and there are all kinds of rewards and perks you will get for your support — from your name listed in the program, to free tickets to an exclusive dinner with Nancy Carlin and me! Your generosity will make all the difference.∞ Our conservative audience estimate is at least 750 people over the course of the play's initial run of sixteen performances at the Potrero Stage;∞ We hope to engage audiences -- through the play and post-perfomance talk backs -- on questions of identity and the dangers facing society when we acquiesce in the face of prejudice and hatred.∞ We will make every effort to bring out critics and generate interest for a possible future tour of The Obligation.Philip C.

Since we opened 11 years ago, we have produced, in our 46 seat theatre on 42nd St, over 1000 full-length plays and close to 2000 short works and dance pieces. A-Listers like Meryl Streep, Edward Albee, Tracy Ullman, Ally Sheedy, John Patrick Shanley, and Mamie Gumer have attended. Recently, we had the opportunity to present the reunited cast of THE GUIDING LIGHT in BREATHING UNDER DIRT by veteran Guiding Light actor Michael O’Leary. </p><p>But beyond the name-dropping, and most importantly, we have been the creative home for the LIVE ARTIST developing their work and presenting it on stage here in New York City with little or no cost to the participant.</p><p>Last November, we found out that we had to leave our home of 10 years on 42nd St for they were selling the building, so we went on the hunt for a new space. We contacted commercial brokers and walked the streets of Manhattan searching for space on a quest to save our creative home. We soon discovered very few buildings would even consider our use case. No one wanted to house a small independent theatre because of foot traffic, noise and more, and, not to mention, commercial real estate prices in New York City had more than doubled in over 10 years, with a myriad of added costs.</p><p>But we continued our search because we could not let Manhattan Rep die. We put offers in on spaces and were rejected, dealt with shady brokers and building owners, and learned that a handshake agreement means nothing in the commercial real estate world in New York City. In January, we were told that we could stay in our building, only to be told in April that we had to leave again. </p><p>So we searched and searched and were rejected again and again.  (For a detailed account of our Manhattan theatre space hunting check out manhattanrep.com.) In our quest for a space, we worked with over 30 different brokers, saw scores of spaces, but no one wanted a small independent theatre. No one.

The stage will still be intimate, but not cramped, with gorgeous brand new hardwood floors and an even higher ceiling than on 42nd St.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>THE DRESSING ROOM</strong></h3><p>The Dressing Room will NOT be next to the stage so it will be easier for actors to prepare before going on and there won’t be any sound issues with actors making noise backstage.

<h3>THE STAFF ROOM PLAY</h3>
<p><strong>@STAFFROOMplay</strong></p>
<p>Why fund us?!</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Michelle Payne and I'm a 26 year old playwright from Essex. So hello, that's me!</li>
<li>The Staff Room is the second play I've written, and we were lucky enough to receive a FIVE STAR review from London Theatre 1 last summer. From this, we decided we should try to take our show to Edinburgh Fringe. I cast three fantastic actors -  hard working individuals! </li>
<li>My cast currently includes (subject to change due to various ((AMAZING)) opportunities -- I wouldn't be losing them for nothing): Craig Webb, Faye Derham, Hilary Murnane.</li>
<li>We have already secured a professional performance of the show at the Queens Theatre, Hornchurch. All money from this will go towards the Edinburgh budget.</li>
<li>Our ultimate goal is to be spotted at the Fringe by Channel4 and be overnight sitcom sensations!! - But if not, we would love to get another credit to our CV, raise our profiles, network a little and get some more great reviews in order to constantly pitch it towards the bigger theatres and eventually TV companies.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our financial break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>VENUE: Theatre 3, The Space @ Surgeon's Hall = £675+VAT (I've paid the £162 deposit).</li>
<li>FRINGE APPLICATION FEE: £295.</li>
<li>ACCOMMODATION: £1500 (booked and deposit paid).</li>
<li>TRAVEL: approx £500 </li>
</ul>
<p>TOTAL: £2970 (eek)</p>
<ul><li>We are having gorgeous badges, tote bags, t-shirts and hoodies printed for our fringe run! So if you'd like to get in on that, they will be available as prizes.</li></ul>

@STAFFROOMplay
Why fund us?!

My name is Michelle Payne and I'm a 26 year old playwright from Essex. So hello, that's me!
The Staff Room is the second play I've written, and we were lucky enough to receive a FIVE STAR review from London Theatre 1 last summer. From this, we decided we should try to take our show to Edinburgh Fringe. I cast three fantastic actors -  hard working individuals! 
My cast currently includes (subject to change due to various ((AMAZING)) opportunities -- I wouldn't be losing them for nothing): Craig Webb, Faye Derham, Hilary Murnane.
We have already secured a professional performance of the show at the Queens Theatre, Hornchurch. All money from this will go towards the Edinburgh budget.
Our ultimate goal is to be spotted at the Fringe by Channel4 and be overnight sitcom sensations!! - But if not, we would love to get another credit to our CV, raise our profiles, network a little and get some more great reviews in order to constantly pitch it towards the bigger theatres and eventually TV companies.


What We Need & What You Get
Our financial break down:

VENUE: Theatre 3, The Space @ Surgeon's Hall = £675+VAT (I've paid the £162 deposit).
FRINGE APPLICATION FEE: £295.
ACCOMMODATION: £1500 (booked and deposit paid).
TRAVEL: approx £500 

TOTAL: £2970 (eek)
We are having gorgeous badges, tote bags, t-shirts and hoodies printed for our fringe run! So if you'd like to get in on that, they will be available as prizes.

<p>My name is David Herrera and I am the artistic director of David Herrera Performance Company in San Francisco.  Since 2007 DHPCo. has been at the forefront of emerging dance theater companies shaping the SF/Bay Area artistic landscape.  We are celebrating our 9th season with the premiere of ""The Least of Them"" on May 12-14, 2016 at Z Space theater in San Francisco.  </p>

My name is David Herrera and I am the artistic director of David Herrera Performance Company in San Francisco.  Since 2007 DHPCo. has been at the forefront of emerging dance theater companies shaping the SF/Bay Area artistic landscape.  We are celebrating our 9th season with the premiere of ""The Least of Them"" on May 12-14, 2016 at Z Space theater in San Francisco.  
""The Least of Them"" explores and investigates how peoples' misunderstandings, stereotypes, biases, compartmentalization, and fears of another person's skin color and race can lead to the downfall of relationships, communities, and cultural threads.  At a moment when the nation is facing so many cases of skin color conflicts and uprisings DHPCo. feels that this work is both timely and necessary.

$600     Purchase Finale software<br/>
<br/>
If we raise enough money to finish the score, we

The Impact
Don't Talk About It, SP!T About It is a mix of classic theatre and contemporary poetry and spoken word to speak for our people, to educate our communities and to uplift those around us.
We are working to fuse art, music, movement and the urban theatre movement to bring to you the story of our LA city street. 

Risks & Challenges
The topics that SP!T works to tackle such as the Black Lives Matter Movement, Homelessness and Poverty, Domestic Violence, Social Welfare and Justice; topics that are not commonly presented on the stage. We need your help to bring this work to life. We cannot do it alone.

<p>Princess Nylah and the Journey to the Magic Window is a children’s production written and produced by Susan C. Small. This musical fairy tale centers around Nylah, a self-proclaimed Princess who embarks on an epic journey beyond the ""Magic Window"" where she discovers the importance of courage and friendship. With rousing musical numbers like ""Find Your Magic"" and ""Together"", this production focuses on important themes such as faith and the importance of discovering ones ""magic"". </p>

<h3><strong>The Project Summary</strong></h3>
<p>From £1 to £1000, your support helps...</p>
<p>Using Latin and Hip Hop dance theatre and culture, Ladylike, explores what it is to be ‘ladylike’ and and challenges our notions of gender, sexuality and identity.</p>
<p>Ladylike is very close to my heart.  I had been thinking about the complexities of male sexuality, the patriarchy and what it's like to feel silenced in a ""man's world"". At different stages of my life I have felt restricted by how communities or society teaches me to behave. I decided to explore these 'should' and 'should nots' through art.</p>
<p>Ladylike invites the audience to explore a range of themes in juxtaposition, including masculine &amp; feminine, fight &amp; flight, consent &amp; rape, oppression &amp; liberation. </p>
<p>Cultural dances/ customs explored include the dances of Orisha deities &amp; the Rumba dance of flirtation Guaguanco- dances from Cuba, which can be traced back to West &amp; Central Africa in origins, as a result of the slave trade. There is also reference to Hip Hop, the Apache line of Uprocking from NYC, breaking and the overtly sexualised Reggaeton.</p>
<p>Simple props, music (composed by Sabio Janiak), language and light projections have been well considered to accentuate meaning, as well as beautiful costumes designed by Jodie-Simone Howe.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Want:</strong></h3>
<p>We are asking people to donate as much or as little as you can towards making this project happen, or just to spread the word to those you think might like to donate to a female empowering Afro-Latin- Hip Hop dance theatre piece!</p>
<p>We want receive enough funds to put the work onto the stage, pay the dancers to rehearse and perform, light the piece professionally and have someone to film it so we can promote the work and give it the exposure it deserves. </p>
<p>It is important to all of us that this work is finished, &amp; this unique language of Afro-Latin &amp; Hip Hop Dance Theatre and feminine perspective is seen.</p>
<p>At the moment I have self funded paying the dancers for two weeks (though the have done at least three weeks of work), paying to hire lights, for accommodation, travel, a fee to finish the music, to have the work filmed and various other costs. I have not been able to pay myself for any of the work I have put in myself. </p>
<p>We are raising crowd funds to pay for some of these:</p>
<p>Rehearsals (3 weeks at £450 per artist (4 artists): 2 weeks in London 10-14th October &amp; 24-28th October, One week in Leeds, York &amp; Newcastle including a sharing at York University (17-21st October)</p>
<p>To have the work filmed and edited  (£300).</p>
<p>To light the work professionally and hire lights (£650)</p>
<p>To hire an expert train us in working with young people to deliver sex education workshops on Consent, Gender &amp; Pleasure, in particular looking at sexual violence (£500). </p>
<p>Paying a rehearsal director (£200).</p>
<p>Employing a Stage manager (£150)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the Artists:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Ella: With a background in Latin Dance since 2000, I took up Breaking because I wanted to express myself in a way where it wasn't all about my smile or how many sequins I had on, and I decided to train as a contemporary dancer for two years in London, graduating with a postgraduate diploma from The London School of Contemporary Dance in 2011. I also have a politics and sociology degree from Leeds University. I love to create, and am passionate about seeing real high-level Latin and Hip Hop Dance in the Theatre in the UK. </p>
<p>As the choreographer and director of Latin Hip Hop Dance Theatre Company Ella Mesma Company (2011), my work has been described as ‘stunning,’ ‘provocative’ and ‘unabashedly emotional’ (The Guardian).</p>
<p>I established Latin dance company Element Arts, in Leeds in 2005 and then began producing Roots of Rumba (an annual Latin Dance Theatre Festival which gives Latin dance artists a platform for their work) in London in 2013. My Latin accolades include Passista (First soloist) in Rio de Janeiro carnival 2006, Rainha Da Bateria for London School of Samba 2008, The Channel 4 Comedy Gala 2016 and a fellowship in Cuba &amp; Brazil in 2015 (Winston Churchill Memorial Trust). I also teach and have been commissioned to create work and run workshops across the UK and internationally.</p>
<p>In 2013, I was selected as a future Dance Leader for the ABLE leadership program, and in 2015, awarded a Bench fellowship for emerging choreographers. I am currently Associate Dance Artist at Dance City in Newcastle. As a performer, I have worked internationally including tours with Russell Maliphant Company, Southpaw Company, &amp; performing for the Olympics Opening Ceremony, Wendy Houston’s ‘Stupid Women’, Warsan Shire (as featured in Beyonce’s ‘Lemonade’)'s ‘The Ugly Daughter’ and Adidas  </p>
<p>Anna is Anglo-Argentine, and studied dance and athletics from a young age. She studied dance at Facultade Angel Vianna in Rio de Janeiro and worked with Gustavo Cirico, Frederico Paredes, and Deborah Colker. Anna worked with Vertigo Dance Company in Israel in 2015. Anna is a Tango Dancer and assists for the Leandro Palou Tango Academy. She has taught workshops for Come Dancing and Strictly Come Dancing.</p>
<p>Lianett was born in La Habana, Cuba, and trained at the National School of Art in Cuba (ENA), graduating in 2005 with a gold title. In 2006 she joined the National Company of Contemporary Dance in Cuba and has toured Internationally with them, as well as Havanna Rakatan, Balletronic and Carmen la Cubana.</p>
<p>Azara has been practicing various styles of HipHop including breaking for the last 10 years. She is also a live artist and actress. Performance experience includes Indigo2, Wembley Stadium, and The Olympics opening Ceremony. Azara was runner in The Winter Pride Art Awards 2016 with her debut solo piece ‘I Am Woman’.</p>
<p>Hsing Ya, born in Taiwan is an International Contemporary dancer. East and West training practices including Ballet, Modern, Gaga, Tai-Chi, Yoga &amp; Belly dancing make her a diverse artist. She is also a choreographer and teacher. Her performance experience includes in Taiwan includes Feng Dance Theatre, Dance Forum Taipei Company, WC dance company. Since she came to UK in 2016, she has performed for Appetite Dance Productions and recently joined Ella Mesma Company. Hsing Ya has also taken part in a Choreography Residency at Watermill Center, Long Island in New York, The American Dance Festival and The Taipei Artist Village.</p>
<p>Sabio is a Composer, producer, multi-instrumentalist based in London, Sabio has a masters degree in classical percussion (Academy of Music in Poland) and music production and performance (London Centre of Contemporary Music-). Sabio plays more than 150 instruments and his experience of working together with world famous artists, have contributed to enhancing his rare musical sensibility and interest in the science of sound.</p>
<p>Ciaran has worked at Melton Mowbray Theatre and Barry Young's Star Dust as well as gaining a BTEC in Technical Theatre (Brooksby Melton College), BA (hons) in Technical Theatre Studies at East15 acting school resulting in a full time position at Terry Tew Sound and Lighting. Ciran was charged with overseeing the Lighting and Rigging departments for 3 1⁄2 years before freelancing. He has lit work for Ballet Black, The Young Vic, New York Theatre Ballet and Gecko to name a few.</p>
<p>Jodie-Simone has created the costumes for this work, which will be completed ready for the 1st September and will be used from the first days of rehearsals in October. Jodie has been working within the Creative Arts for the past 5 years in Costume and Visual Aesthetics within Dance Theatre. Her experience as a researcher in marketing, television and radio, along with her passion for art and dance have given Jodie a well-rounded background in creative arts. She has worked with the Company since 2012. She has made costumes for Ivan Blackstock, Young Vic and Breakin Convention to name a few.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Sadler's Wells liked our work so much that we will be premiering it in London at Sadler's Wells, with our very own Wildcard on 8th June 2017.</p>
<p>We want to reach a mixed audience including those not usually interested in dance through this issue based work. My intention is to  attract a mixed audience, including men as there are inferences relating to masculinity (not to just preach to the converted).</p>
<p>With the theme of gender in society and specifically perceptions of women’s role is universal, and following Michelle Obama's wonderful speech in October, and the surprising US election results, I feel this work has arrived at a poignant time. </p>
<p>To date, people have said:</p>
<p>'Strong &amp; Empowering' Richmix</p>
<p>'Brilliant show and Q&amp;A session' Mandinga</p>
<p>'Timeless and current issues that women continue to face everyday' The Tabernacle </p>
<p>'Absolutely stunning and provocative piece I saw last night , thank you for the inspiration and celebration of your exploration!!!' Yorkshire Dance</p>
<p>'Completely engaged- enthralling, emotional, inspiring and grounding work' Mercy Nabirye</p>

</div></div>","The Project Summary
From £1 to £1000, your support helps...
Using Latin and Hip Hop dance theatre and culture, Ladylike, explores what it is to be ‘ladylike’ and and challenges our notions of gender, sexuality and identity.
Ladylike is very close to my heart.  I had been thinking about the complexities of male sexuality, the patriarchy and what it's like to feel silenced in a ""man's world"". At different stages of my life I have felt restricted by how communities or society teaches me to behave. I decided to explore these 'should' and 'should nots' through art.
Ladylike invites the audience to explore a range of themes in juxtaposition, including masculine & feminine, fight & flight, consent & rape, oppression & liberation. 
Cultural dances/ customs explored include the dances of Orisha deities & the Rumba dance of flirtation Guaguanco- dances from Cuba, which can be traced back to West & Central Africa in origins, as a result of the slave trade. There is also reference to Hip Hop, the Apache line of Uprocking from NYC, breaking and the overtly sexualised Reggaeton.
Simple props, music (composed by Sabio Janiak), language and light projections have been well considered to accentuate meaning, as well as beautiful costumes designed by Jodie-Simone Howe.
What We Want:
We are asking people to donate as much or as little as you can towards making this project happen, or just to spread the word to those you think might like to donate to a female empowering Afro-Latin- Hip Hop dance theatre piece!
We want receive enough funds to put the work onto the stage, pay the dancers to rehearse and perform, light the piece professionally and have someone to film it so we can promote the work and give it the exposure it deserves. 
It is important to all of us that this work is finished, & this unique language of Afro-Latin & Hip Hop Dance Theatre and feminine perspective is seen.
At the moment I have self funded paying the dancers for two weeks (though the have done at least three weeks of work), paying to hire lights, for accommodation, travel, a fee to finish the music, to have the work filmed and various other costs. I have not been able to pay myself for any of the work I have put in myself. 
We are raising crowd funds to pay for some of these:
Rehearsals (3 weeks at £450 per artist (4 artists): 2 weeks in London 10-14th October & 24-28th October, One week in Leeds, York & Newcastle including a sharing at York University (17-21st October)
To have the work filmed and edited  (£300).
To light the work professionally and hire lights (£650)
To hire an expert train us in working with young people to deliver sex education workshops on Consent, Gender & Pleasure, in particular looking at sexual violence (£500). 
Paying a rehearsal director (£200).
Employing a Stage manager (£150)
 
About the Artists:
My name is Ella: With a background in Latin Dance since 2000, I took up Breaking because I wanted to express myself in a way where it wasn't all about my smile or how many sequins I had on, and I decided to train as a contemporary dancer for two years in London, graduating with a postgraduate diploma from The London School of Contemporary Dance in 2011. I also have a politics and sociology degree from Leeds University. I love to create, and am passionate about seeing real high-level Latin and Hip Hop Dance in the Theatre in the UK. 
As the choreographer and director of Latin Hip Hop Dance Theatre Company Ella Mesma Company (2011), my work has been described as ‘stunning,’ ‘provocative’ and ‘unabashedly emotional’ (The Guardian).
I established Latin dance company Element Arts, in Leeds in 2005 and then began producing Roots of Rumba (an annual Latin Dance Theatre Festival which gives Latin dance artists a platform for their work) in London in 2013. My Latin accolades include Passista (First soloist) in Rio de Janeiro carnival 2006, Rainha Da Bateria for London School of Samba 2008, The Channel 4 Comedy Gala 2016 and a fellowship in Cuba & Brazil in 2015 (Winston Churchill Memorial Trust). I also teach and have been commissioned to create work and run workshops across the UK and internationally.
In 2013, I was selected as a future Dance Leader for the ABLE leadership program, and in 2015, awarded a Bench fellowship for emerging choreographers. I am currently Associate Dance Artist at Dance City in Newcastle. As a performer, I have worked internationally including tours with Russell Maliphant Company, Southpaw Company, & performing for the Olympics Opening Ceremony, Wendy Houston’s ‘Stupid Women’, Warsan Shire (as featured in Beyonce’s ‘Lemonade’)'s ‘The Ugly Daughter’ and Adidas  
Anna is Anglo-Argentine, and studied dance and athletics from a young age. She studied dance at Facultade Angel Vianna in Rio de Janeiro and worked with Gustavo Cirico, Frederico Paredes, and Deborah Colker. Anna worked with Vertigo Dance Company in Israel in 2015. Anna is a Tango Dancer and assists for the Leandro Palou Tango Academy. She has taught workshops for Come Dancing and Strictly Come Dancing.
Lianett was born in La Habana, Cuba, and trained at the National School of Art in Cuba (ENA), graduating in 2005 with a gold title. In 2006 she joined the National Company of Contemporary Dance in Cuba and has toured Internationally with them, as well as Havanna Rakatan, Balletronic and Carmen la Cubana.
Azara has been practicing various styles of HipHop including breaking for the last 10 years. She is also a live artist and actress. Performance experience includes Indigo2, Wembley Stadium, and The Olympics opening Ceremony. Azara was runner in The Winter Pride Art Awards 2016 with her debut solo piece ‘I Am Woman’.
Hsing Ya, born in Taiwan is an International Contemporary dancer. East and West training practices including Ballet, Modern, Gaga, Tai-Chi, Yoga & Belly dancing make her a diverse artist. She is also a choreographer and teacher. Her performance experience includes in Taiwan includes Feng Dance Theatre, Dance Forum Taipei Company, WC dance company. Since she came to UK in 2016, she has performed for Appetite Dance Productions and recently joined Ella Mesma Company. Hsing Ya has also taken part in a Choreography Residency at Watermill Center, Long Island in New York, The American Dance Festival and The Taipei Artist Village.
Sabio is a Composer, producer, multi-instrumentalist based in London, Sabio has a masters degree in classical percussion (Academy of Music in Poland) and music production and performance (London Centre of Contemporary Music-). Sabio plays more than 150 instruments and his experience of working together with world famous artists, have contributed to enhancing his rare musical sensibility and interest in the science of sound.
Ciaran has worked at Melton Mowbray Theatre and Barry Young's Star Dust as well as gaining a BTEC in Technical Theatre (Brooksby Melton College), BA (hons) in Technical Theatre Studies at East15 acting school resulting in a full time position at Terry Tew Sound and Lighting. Ciran was charged with overseeing the Lighting and Rigging departments for 3 1⁄2 years before freelancing. He has lit work for Ballet Black, The Young Vic, New York Theatre Ballet and Gecko to name a few.
Jodie-Simone has created the costumes for this work, which will be completed ready for the 1st September and will be used from the first days of rehearsals in October. Jodie has been working within the Creative Arts for the past 5 years in Costume and Visual Aesthetics within Dance Theatre. Her experience as a researcher in marketing, television and radio, along with her passion for art and dance have given Jodie a well-rounded background in creative arts. She has worked with the Company since 2012. She has made costumes for Ivan Blackstock, Young Vic and Breakin Convention to name a few.
 
The Impact
Sadler's Wells liked our work so much that we will be premiering it in London at Sadler's Wells, with our very own Wildcard on 8th June 2017.
We want to reach a mixed audience including those not usually interested in dance through this issue based work. My intention is to  attract a mixed audience, including men as there are inferences relating to masculinity (not to just preach to the converted).
With the theme of gender in society and specifically perceptions of women’s role is universal, and following Michelle Obama's wonderful speech in October, and the surprising US election results, I feel this work has arrived at a poignant time. 
To date, people have said:
'Strong & Empowering' Richmix
'Brilliant show and Q&A session' Mandinga
'Timeless and current issues that women continue to face everyday' The Tabernacle 
'Absolutely stunning and provocative piece I saw last night , thank you for the inspiration and celebration of your exploration!!!' Yorkshire Dance
'Completely engaged- enthralling, emotional, inspiring and grounding work' Mercy Nabirye

</p><p>Hello, </p>
<p>I'm Francesca, a writer, performer
and theatre maker and this is an unashamed bid to get some pennies and pounds
to support taking a new show to Edinburgh Festival. I'm working, as always,
with award winning producer Pippa Frith, following on from a successful
Edinburgh back in 2011 and a host of successful commissions and national tours
in the years in between. </p>
<p><i>Stories to Tell in the Middle
of the Night </i>is something like a live
late night radio show that takes you through the night. In an hour. Except the
DJ (that's me) is spinning stories instead of records. It's not durational. The
stories will follow the pattern of not being able to sleep, a reflection of the
night. </p>
<p>It came from not sleeping, the
strange stories and thoughts that occupy the night, the mind, while awake. What
keeps us awake and what connects us. Or disconnects us. What stories we tell in
the dark. Rage, narcissism, technology and solace. It also comes from listening
to old raconteurs on the radio, the good old tradition of storytelling. I will
be talking directly to the audience, we'll make the most of these moments live,
together.  </p>
<p>Here's how the copy goes: </p>
<p>'<i>I'll take you through the
night, it's highs, it's lows. Those frustrations. Lets populate the long dark
hours and the small light hours with stories. People, until the morning' </i></p>
<p><b>A live radio show for those
that can't sleep, aren't asleep. Instead of records this DJ is spinning
stories. Tales in tangled sheets that are odd, true, funny and familiar. </b></p>
<p><i>Stories</i> is different to some of my previous work and I've got
a brilliant team to push me on my way. Lekan Lewel, a new collaborator,
currently RTYDS Resident Assistant Director at Derby Theatre has come aboard as
director. With Iain Armstrong as sound designer and Claire Browne as set
designer. </p>
<p>We'd like to take this show to
Edinburgh Fringe, one of the best places to showcase new work. It is considered
<i>the</i> place to get great audiences, promoters, booking and reviews and
press coverage. It is also pretty hard to fund. Which is where you come in. </p>
<p>We've got a place at Summerhall
one of the best venues going and we've got some support and funding, as well as
reaching in our pockets (and behind the sofa, in the change jar) but we need a
bit more to get us there.  </p>
<p>By supporting us in this, we'll
get to Edinburgh but also hopefully secure future tour dates taking the show to
wider audiences nationally. Times are tough at present but we'd be grateful for
anything you would like donate, it all adds up. And if you can't please do share
to your networks. </p>
<p>We're hoping that you'll enjoy the
possibilities of what you can get for your pounds &amp; pennies.  We had fun drawing up the list of perks and
they're aimed at giving you a little piece of the show, or a little piece of
you in the show or if you really want, your very own show. </p>

<p><i><u>How Eva Von Schnippisch Single-Handedly Won WW2</u></i></p>
<p><i>The official secrecy act is over – and Eva is ready to set the record straight. Germany’s greatest underground cabaret star turned into Britain’s No.1 spy and was given the toughest mission of all: infiltrate to the top.  Eva tells a comedic, saucy, ‘allo ‘allo-esque, action-packed story of love, betrayal, frankfurters, the 'other' Eva . . . and de-bunks the bunker story once and for all!<br/>It’s time to burn your history books.</i></p>

<p>""Back to back gags from start to finish, Brilliant!"" </p>
<p>""My face hurts from laughing so much!"" </p>
<h3>
<br/>What do you need?</h3>
<p>I need your donations to help me take this amazingly 'hilarious', 'seat-wetting, laugh-a-minute"" show to Edinburgh.  I have won myself a 10-night run with PBH's Free Fringe, a wonderful organisation that helps the 'little man' get their work seen at this world-class theatre &amp; comedy festival.  'Free Fringe' means that performers can take shows to The Edinburgh Fringe without the financial risk, and audiences can go and see shows without spending loads of money.  So, while there are still the guaranteed out-laying costs...there is no guarantee of in-coming revenue. ""Why do it then you crazy fool?!"" I hear some of you ask.  I do it because I am passionate and committed to getting my show seen and enjoyed and hopefully reviewed so I can take it all over the world...or even just the country....or anywhere.  I'm just doing it, because that's what writers and performers do.  This is by far the finest work I have ever created, I am insanely proud of it and it needs to be shared.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>How much are you aiming for &amp; where is it going?</h3>
<p>Ladies &amp; Gentlemen I am aiming for £5000.</p>
<p>Putting on a show of any kind costs more money than you ever expect.  Here are just <u>some</u> of the things that your donations will go towards:</p>
<p>Poster &amp; flyer printing, a tonne of blu-tak, national express coach ticket, national express excess baggage supplement ticket, PA hire, projector hire, sound technician for each show, eye-lash glue, costume repairs, frankfurter prop replacement, fresh Brie cheese for each show, batteries for my loudspeaker, insurance (yawn), food to keep me strong, throat lozenges, honey, yogi throat comfort tea, and vitamins to keep me healthy while I work my body, mind &amp; soul to.the.BONE!  </p>
<p>Whilst the above may not appear to be that much, I can assure you that it all adds up quickly and very painfully.  So far I have funded my run at the Brighton Fringe 2016 completely on my own and out of my own pocket, and an artist's pocket is as deep as Boris Johnson's truth plane.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>Why should I donate to Eva?</h3>
<p>If you have ever been in the company of Eva Von Schnippisch, if she has ever made you laugh, cry, cackle, smile, titter, raise an eye-brow, chuckle, breath in air through pursed lips, make your loins stir (more than likely), make your palms sweat, make your feet tap, your hips sway or your fingers click.  If Eva has ever made you look at the world in a different way, introduced you to ideas and notions you had never thought of before, made you dream of a better future, or made you remember times past.  If Eva has had <u>any</u> kind of impact on you...then please find it in your hearts and pockets to give her something back.  Think of all the joy she keeps on giving...and how you can re-pay her in kind and allow her to keep on giving that joy to those attending the Edinburgh Fringe and beyond.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Can I see the show before it goes to Edinburgh?</h3>
<p>There is one chance and <u>one chance only</u> to see HEVSSHWWW2 before it goes north!<br/>An evening of cabaret guests, 'Truth OR Dare For Dollar' fundraising...and then the hour-long show will take place on:<br/><strong>WEDNESDAY 27th JULY</strong><br/><strong>7:30pm<br/>'The Others', 6 &amp; 8 Manor Rd, Stoke Newington, London N16 5SA</strong><br/><br/><i><strong>DIFFERENT TICKET TIERS AVAILABLE:</strong></i><br/>£10 - ""I'm A Stingy Git Ticket"" <br/>£15 - ""Show Only Ticket""<br/>£20 - ""Show &amp; Gift Ticket""<br/>£30 - ""VIP Show &amp; Gift Ticket""<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>I'm skint sorry, but can I help Eva another way?</h3>
<p>Crowd-funding at a time of austerity is never going to be a good idea *gulp*.  If you really cannot spare £10, but you want to help my cause, then here are some other ways you can help Eva:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help share this campaign with your friends, maybe they can donate instead - so you don't feel so guilty about not donating.</li>
<li>Do you know anyone living or going to Edinburgh?!  Maybe they can come to one of my shows?  Maybe they can help me with a lift instead of taking a costly taxi?  Maybe they can make me a hot homely meal or a cup of tea and tell me ""everything is going to be alright""?</li>
<li>Do you have any PRESS or REVIEWER contacts?  Eva would love you to share any useful contacts with her to help her get maximum coverage at the fringe.</li>
<li>Do you have access to unlimited Frankfurters?  Perhaps you know someone who worked for HERTA?  Maybe you can help me get sponsored by HERTA Sausages?</li>
<li>Do you have access to a quality printer at work and are happy to take on a covert-printing mission?  Large corporate companies go through paper and ink like its going out of fashion - so who's <u>really</u> going to notice?  Plus, you'll have the inner peace and satisfaction that you've helped the 'underdog' whilst sticking up a metaphorical two-finger salute to the corporate world.</li>
<li>Do you have any experience of taking a show to Edinburgh?  Eva would really benefit from your advice over a coffee sometime soon.</li>
<li>Follow Eva on social media - 'like', share and help Eva grow. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/EvaVonSchnippisch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/EvaVonSchnippisch</a><br/><a href=""https://twitter.com/vonschnippisch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/vonschnippisch</a><br/><a href=""http://www.missstephanieware.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.missstephanieware.co.uk</a>

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Fuse Theatre
began one year ago as the realization of a life long dream of Stacey Ardelean
to create a theatre community that brings together people to celebrate and
learn with and about one another.<span> 
This Indiegogo campaign is the result of a year’s worth of planning and
preparation.  We have started
several partnerships and projects, developed our business plan and are ready to
take the company to the next level! 
This startup campaign will allow continued development of these
partnerships and the ability create new ones. Fuse Theatre is a not for profit, 501(c)3 corporation and contributions are tax deductible. </span></p>
<p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><span></span></p><p><b><u>Fuse Theatre Values:</u></b></p>
<p><b><i>Collaboration</i></b><b><i>    *    Creativity</i></b><b><i>    *    Connectivity</i></b>
</p><p style=""text-align: left;""><b>What we do:</b></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i><b>Stage Practice:</b></i>  Production of original or published works typical of theatres.   Fuse Theatre’s approach is to add elements of audience engagement to deepen understanding and connection to the performance.  The goal of our productions is to engage the community in the production.  The Dating Chronicles is an example of this work.</span></div><p></p><p><b><i>Applied Theatre Practice: </i></b> Applying theatre methods of playmaking, community-based theatre and theatre in education, Fuse works with community partners – both actors and non-actors to generate thought provoking performances. The goals of these programs are to teach, to provide opportunities for collaborative work (create opportunities for silenced voices) and create awareness of social issues through performance.  Fuse Theatre’s Community-Based Theatre Ensemble is an example of this practice.</p><p><b><i>Civic Engagement Practice:</i></b> Artists work with the community members to engage in dialogue and discussion using theatre techniques.  The goals of this practice are community connections and civic dialogue.  Fuse Theatre’s co-sponsorship with the San Mateo County History Museum of <a href=""http://www.pechakucha.org/cities/redwood-city"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pecha Kucha: Redwood City</a> is one example of this practice.</p>For more about our programs and partnerships go to our website: <a href=""http://www.fusetheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.fusetheatre.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fusetheatre.org </a> <br/><br/>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $5000 for our startup fund.<span>  The campaign will fund marketing expenses including graphic design
and materials, further web development and seed money for our current projects.  Further funding will be
sought for individual projects through grants, ticket sales and sponsorship.  We have
several levels of giving so you can help….<i><b>Light the Fuse</b></i>!  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>*Shirts
will be unisex sizing.  When you purchase a Perk that includes a shirt,
please make sure you indicate size in the notes section.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>*For
those supporters out of the area, we will provide you with another special gift
from Fuse Theatre! <br/></i></p><p><i>*Please indicate in the note section if you would like your contribution to remain anonymous.</i></p><p><i><b>First 50 Donors over $50 receive a Fuse coffee mug and a special recognition as one of the First 50 for Fuse!  </b></i><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Our goal is building community and creating access to
live theatre experiences.<span>  Fuse
Theatre’s main approach to create original community-based theatre with artistic
partners brings a unique method and approach to our local area. With our
startup fundraising we will also begin our Stage Practice and produce two
scripted plays for families and youth. We are working to bring theatre into many non-traditional
spaces and increase the access to great theatre in our community.  </span></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>In a community like the Bay Area where the rents and
housing costs continue to rise the challenges facing non-profit arts organizations
are great.<span>  By remaining a
“nomadic” company we can fulfill our mission of bringing theatre to
unique spaces and widen the scope of access for theatre AND can keep our
overhead costs lower and focus on creating great theatre while paying our artists competitively.  Our first order of business was to
obtain our 501(c)3 so that we could begin to apply for grants and sponsorships. This is of course a challenge as well as a brand new company with a very short history.  This startup fundraiser will also help us establish a ""track record"" of fundraising and be more marketable in the philanthropic community.  Our current board of
directors has experience in marketing, business management, human resources and
financial planning.  We are
actively seeking other board members with legal, arts marketing and/or theatre experience. </span></p>

began one year ago as the realization of a life long dream of Stacey Ardelean
to create a theatre community that brings together people to celebrate and
learn with and about one another. 
This Indiegogo campaign is the result of a year’s worth of planning and
preparation.  We have started
several partnerships and projects, developed our business plan and are ready to
take the company to the next level! 
This startup campaign will allow continued development of these
partnerships and the ability create new ones. Fuse Theatre is a not for profit, 501(c)3 corporation and contributions are tax deductible. 
Fuse Theatre Values:
Collaboration    *    Creativity    *    Connectivity
What we do:
Stage Practice:  Production of original or published works typical of theatres.   Fuse Theatre’s approach is to add elements of audience engagement to deepen understanding and connection to the performance.  The goal of our productions is to engage the community in the production.  The Dating Chronicles is an example of this work.Applied Theatre Practice:  Applying theatre methods of playmaking, community-based theatre and theatre in education, Fuse works with community partners – both actors and non-actors to generate thought provoking performances. The goals of these programs are to teach, to provide opportunities for collaborative work (create opportunities for silenced voices) and create awareness of social issues through performance.  Fuse Theatre’s Community-Based Theatre Ensemble is an example of this practice.Civic Engagement Practice: Artists work with the community members to engage in dialogue and discussion using theatre techniques.  The goals of this practice are community connections and civic dialogue.  Fuse Theatre’s co-sponsorship with the San Mateo County History Museum of Pecha Kucha: Redwood City is one example of this practice.For more about our programs and partnerships go to our website: www.fusetheatre.org  
What We Need & What You Get

Our goal is to raise $5000 for our startup fund.  The campaign will fund marketing expenses including graphic design
and materials, further web development and seed money for our current projects.  Further funding will be
sought for individual projects through grants, ticket sales and sponsorship.  We have
several levels of giving so you can help….Light the Fuse!  

*Shirts
will be unisex sizing.  When you purchase a Perk that includes a shirt,
please make sure you indicate size in the notes section.

*For
those supporters out of the area, we will provide you with another special gift
from Fuse Theatre! *Please indicate in the note section if you would like your contribution to remain anonymous.First 50 Donors over $50 receive a Fuse coffee mug and a special recognition as one of the First 50 for Fuse!  


The Impact
Our goal is building community and creating access to
live theatre experiences.  Fuse
Theatre’s main approach to create original community-based theatre with artistic
partners brings a unique method and approach to our local area. With our
startup fundraising we will also begin our Stage Practice and produce two
scripted plays for families and youth. We are working to bring theatre into many non-traditional
spaces and increase the access to great theatre in our community.  
Risks & Challenges
In a community like the Bay Area where the rents and
housing costs continue to rise the challenges facing non-profit arts organizations
are great.  By remaining a
“nomadic” company we can fulfill our mission of bringing theatre to
unique spaces and widen the scope of access for theatre AND can keep our
overhead costs lower and focus on creating great theatre while paying our artists competitively.  Our first order of business was to
obtain our 501(c)3 so that we could begin to apply for grants and sponsorships. This is of course a challenge as well as a brand new company with a very short history.  This startup fundraiser will also help us establish a ""track record"" of fundraising and be more marketable in the philanthropic community.  Our current board of
directors has experience in marketing, business management, human resources and
financial planning.  We are
actively seeking other board members with legal, arts marketing and/or theatre experience.

<p><strong>About us:</strong></p>
<p>Nebula Company Theatre is a not-for-profit theatre company in Vancouver BC led by artistic director Mily Mumford (who is also the writer/director for this show). Our mandate is to create intelligent, political and innovative theatre that promotes the work and voices of racially and gender diverse artists. We also incorporate an element of science fiction to every show.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the show:</strong></p>
<p>In short- it’s the Breakfast Club in space. It is two generations into the future and Earth is uninhabitable. A subsection of the population survives in space stations in orbit around our planet, a ""time-capsule"" of mostly very privileged Americans. A misfit group of the “post-script” generation- the first to be born in space- bond over their shared anxieties and a desire to reconcile with what happened to the rest of humanity. It aims to shed light on the dynamics of oppression in our current society, while providing a futurist view of what climate change and a divided Western World could produce. Also spaceships, hoverboards and a sassy social media robot called Facebot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So here’s the breakdown:</strong></p>
<p>Making cool science-fiction-dystopic-#resistance theatre isn’t free. Now we at Nebula Company are pretty crafty at making cool space effects on the cheap, but we still need a bit of help to cover the costs of things like venue space, paying house technicians, materials for set (think plexi-glass, a LOT of plexi-glass) and costumes. We want to try to raise as much money as we can to cover these costs so any money we make on ticket sales can go back to our performers, designers and crew.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now will $2500 cover all of it, you may be wondering? No. We are applying for additional funding through Granville Island, the City of Vancouver and individual donors. But we realize that a lot of folks we share this campaign with are in a similar boat to us- that is, dirt poor living on the salary of a moisture farmer on Tatooine. So we wanted to make a realistic so contributions of small amounts like $5-15 still make a big difference. In fact, we’d only need 500 facebook friends to give us 5 bucks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is what we are going to be spending this campaign money on:</p>
<p>$500 event insurance (required by venue)</p>
<p>$500 makeup, latex prosthetics and contact lenses</p>
<p>$200 costumes (we have sourced some already from the workshop)</p>
<p>$250 sfx rentals (fog machine, extra projectors, super secret hologram building supplies)</p>
<p>$250 marketing (part of this will be posters, photography and our publicist)</p>
<p>$500 set materials (scrim material, pvc pipes and PLEXI-GLASS)</p>
<p>$300 rehearsal space rental for last two weeks of rehearsals</p>

<p>If you've seen The Humble Boys live in concert, you know that when they begin to play, the room stops, heart rates rise, goosebumps appear, and eyes start to mist. </p>
<p>When Juan and Ahmed approached me with the vision for this live show, I experienced the same symptoms. ""All You Seek"" is a collection of songs that take the listener on a journey through artistic struggle, love, loss, and revitalization. They wanted to tell this story not just musically, but visually, through dance and movement. I come from a deep background of physical theater, and I know how powerfully an actor can engage their body to tell a story.</p>
<p>We have gathered a group of performers with immense talent: Actors with backgrounds in African Dance, Jazz, Ballet, Tap, Pole Dance, and more. Actors with intensive physical theater training and with music in their bones. We've recruited a company of talented strings, brass, and percussion players, to fill out the sound that The Humble Boys envision. Juan and Ahmed have entrusted me (Dani Larson) with the role of Director, and I am going to bring together all of these different elements to tell the story of ""All You Seek.""</p>

<p>As you probably know, not all artists are rolling in dough, and not every project is backed by a generous and financially-blessed funder. This group is incredibly rich in training, qualification, and talent, but this show has no Executive Producer. YOU are the Executive Producers. With $6,000, we can...</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish booking rehearsal space.</li>
<li>Pay all the performers. (Much less than what they are worth, but more than nothing!)</li>
<li>Move a piano into the performance space.</li>
<li>Hire a lighting designer for the show. </li>
<li>Pay The Humble Boys and the director. </li>
</ul>
<p>If just 240 of you (that's 120 people per performance) donate $25 each, we can reach our goal. You donation is your advanced ticket sale to see the show.</p>
<p>Without these advance ticket sales, the show won't happen. </p>
<p>Your donation today gets you something truly tangible. Your butt in a seat on December 1st or December 8th. These are going to be truly magical, can't-miss evenings, filled with electricity. I am truly overwhelmed by the amount of talent behind this project already, and I can promise you that you will get every penny's worth of your investment in this project today. </p>

<h3>Real Talk</h3>
<p>Since completing my M.F.A. in Acting at USC in 2015, I have learned....SO much in the school of life. Here are some things I've learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone is hustling. How many jobs do YOU have?</li>
<li>Nothing is free. Do you know how much a cup of coffee costs at Intelligentsia in Silver Lake? I. Can't. Even. Tell. You. It's too embarrassing. Ahmed and I accidentally had a meeting there one time and immediately regretted it. Never again. We have learned our lesson. We are THRIFTY. </li>
<li>You have to create opportunities yourself. I am so tired of telling myself the story that I don't have the resources, the opportunities, the connections, to do what I was born to do. I'm a storyteller, and I'm here to rewrite this story. </li>
<li>In this crazy, mixed-up world, ART MATTERS. Talent matters. Heart matters. It is so easy to look around the world today and feel despair. To feel helpless. But when we come together to create something collaboratively, we literally change the world. </li>
</ol>
<p>So. Help us rewrite the story of the struggling artist. Participate. Be our Executive Producer. If you can't afford $25, that's okay, we'll still welcome you to the show with open arms. If you can afford more than $25, that's great! You are sending the message that art matters and that artists deserve to be paid. Either way, just make sure to tell us which night you'd like to come when you make your donation, and help us spread the word. Invite a hot date to come with you, bring your Mom, bring a stranger, make a friend. </p>
<p>We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your vote of confidence, and for your investment in us. We look forward to seeing you in December. </p>
<p>All of my best, always,</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I’d like to share some of the positive feedback about ASHANI DANCES' previous concerts.</p>
<p>Andrew Sargus Klein of Bmoreart.com writes,</p>
<p>“Love Me, Now Leave Me Alone is an important reminder that dance is a powerfully responsive tool, one that has the power to delve deeply, and then go beyond, visual work like Hopper’s ... there were beautiful, breathtaking glimpses of intimacy and melancholy, love and despair: all Hopper-esque, but also universal and evergreen.”</p>

<p>Alice Kaderlan of The Seattle Times writes, </p>
<p>""Ashani Dances Is On The Rise ... Harrison, with three very different works. Together, they showcased an artist of diverse talents with sophisticated musical tastes and an understanding of how to use a bare stage to full effect. Appearing at the Broadway Performance Hall, Harrison relied on lighting, rather than expensive sets, to enhance the mood and energy of his ballets. The costumes were simple but effective ..."" <br/><u><a href=""http://seattletimes.com/html/thearts/2023801915_ashanireviewxml.html?syndication=rss"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://seattletimes.com/html/thearts/2023801915...</a></u></p>
<p>Gabrielle Nomura of Seattle Dances writes,<br/>""The result is a company [Ashani Dances] on par with Seattle’s elite in contemporary dance: Spectrum Dance Theater and Whim W’him,Harrison’s international experience and classical background presents a refreshing niche in Seattle’s contemporary dance market; his technical, virtuosic dancers are appealing to both dance aficionados, as well as the general public."" <br/><u><a href=""http://seattledances.com/2014/06/harrison-helps-dancers-soar-at-ashani/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://seattledances.com/2014/06/harrison-helps...</a></u></p>
<p>Ciara McCormack of Seattle Dances writes:<br/>""Harrison’s The Leaves Have Fallen ... lifts and transitions were seamless, a constant connection between the dancers carrying them from one set to the next ... the structure of the piece rose to the surface, highlighting the identities of the characters and reflecting the development of their dialogue. The work’s vocabulary and the magnetic ebb and flow of the dancers’ spatial relationship implied an intimate relationship, which can easily be construed as a depiction of romantic struggle and loss. Harrison stressed in the talk that his mentorship of a younger dancer and the experience of sending him off to a new opportunity inspired the piece. At its heart, Leaves is a tough conversation between two people who love and respect each other, who rely on each other, yet have separate paths to follow."" <br/><u><a href=""http://seattledances.com/2014/05/veteran-dancers-take-seattle-dance-project-home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://seattledances.com/2014/05/veteran-dancer...</a></u></p>
<p>Dean Speer of  Critical Dance Forum writes, </p>
<p>""Not only did Harrison show off what the dancers can do, the dancers showed off his truly excellent dances."" </p>

<p>Michael Upchurch of the Seattle Times writes,</p>
<p>""Last weekend I described Ashani Dances as ""a promising new local dance company."" Scratch that. This troupe is exceptionally accomplished, and their showcase of three new works by artistic director Iyun Ashani Harrison is a knockout. Most of the dancers have an affiliation with Cornish College of the Arts where Harrison teaches (some are graduates, some still students). All have strong, agile ballet skills which are given an intoxicating Afro-Caribbean twist in ""Artifact,"" a joyous, sassy, intricate homage to what Harrison calls ""the beautiful traditional dances of my childhood in Jamaica."" Local composer-percussionist Ben Morrow penned the dance-propulsive score. Sean Rosado and Sam Picart are reasons alone to catch this while you can.""</p>

The Impact
I’d like to share some of the positive feedback about ASHANI DANCES' previous concerts.
Andrew Sargus Klein of Bmoreart.com writes,
“Love Me, Now Leave Me Alone is an important reminder that dance is a powerfully responsive tool, one that has the power to delve deeply, and then go beyond, visual work like Hopper’s ... there were beautiful, breathtaking glimpses of intimacy and melancholy, love and despair: all Hopper-esque, but also universal and evergreen.”
http://www.bmoreart.com/2016/10/love-me-now-lea...
Alice Kaderlan of The Seattle Times writes, 
""Ashani Dances Is On The Rise ... Harrison, with three very different works. Together, they showcased an artist of diverse talents with sophisticated musical tastes and an understanding of how to use a bare stage to full effect. Appearing at the Broadway Performance Hall, Harrison relied on lighting, rather than expensive sets, to enhance the mood and energy of his ballets. The costumes were simple but effective ..."" http://seattletimes.com/html/thearts/2023801915...
Gabrielle Nomura of Seattle Dances writes,""The result is a company [Ashani Dances] on par with Seattle’s elite in contemporary dance: Spectrum Dance Theater and Whim W’him,Harrison’s international experience and classical background presents a refreshing niche in Seattle’s contemporary dance market; his technical, virtuosic dancers are appealing to both dance aficionados, as well as the general public."" http://seattledances.com/2014/06/harrison-helps...
Ciara McCormack of Seattle Dances writes:""Harrison’s The Leaves Have Fallen ... lifts and transitions were seamless, a constant connection between the dancers carrying them from one set to the next ... the structure of the piece rose to the surface, highlighting the identities of the characters and reflecting the development of their dialogue. The work’s vocabulary and the magnetic ebb and flow of the dancers’ spatial relationship implied an intimate relationship, which can easily be construed as a depiction of romantic struggle and loss. Harrison stressed in the talk that his mentorship of a younger dancer and the experience of sending him off to a new opportunity inspired the piece. At its heart, Leaves is a tough conversation between two people who love and respect each other, who rely on each other, yet have separate paths to follow."" http://seattledances.com/2014/05/veteran-dancer...
Dean Speer of  Critical Dance Forum writes, 
""Not only did Harrison show off what the dancers can do, the dancers showed off his truly excellent dances."" 
http://www.ballet-dance.com/forum/viewtopic.php...
Michael Upchurch of the Seattle Times writes,
""Last weekend I described Ashani Dances as ""a promising new local dance company."" Scratch that. This troupe is exceptionally accomplished, and their showcase of three new works by artistic director Iyun Ashani Harrison is a knockout. Most of the dancers have an affiliation with Cornish College of the Arts where Harrison teaches (some are graduates, some still students). All have strong, agile ballet skills which are given an intoxicating Afro-Caribbean twist in ""Artifact,"" a joyous, sassy, intricate homage to what Harrison calls ""the beautiful traditional dances of my childhood in Jamaica."" Local composer-percussionist Ben Morrow penned the dance-propulsive score. Sean Rosado and Sam Picart are reasons alone to catch this while you can.""

<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<h3>
<br/><strong>A young Syrian woman living in New York City has forgotten all about her past, but when she identifies her estranged grandmother on the news among Syrian refugees in the Balkan borders, she embarks on a mission to find her. It will become a spiritual journey to rediscover her roots and her own identity. Dhana is a sort of upside down Greek heroine:  she doesn’t return home after the war, but runs away from peace to find home again in the war. </strong>
</h3>
<p>Looking for her grandmother, Sham, Syrian-born American Dhana travels to the Balkans at the heart of the migration crisis, across borders and through refugee camps, train stations, and makeshift shelters. Amidst such dramatic circumstances, Dhana gathers a clue to unlocking her identity at every step on her journey. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Scene (<i>Dhana #Scene49</i>)  Which You Will Help Us Bring to Brooklyn</h3>
<p>Inside a tent within a refugee camp, a young Syrian is getting married and all the women around her participate in the ritual to ready her for this special moment. </p>
<p>While watching these unique circumstances unfold, Dhana finds herself trapped in a suspended dreamlike reality. All women in her present and in her past surround her and merge: her Syrian childhood memories resurface, the ones no bomb could destroy.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Support This Performance?</strong></h3>
<p>Migration is a topic that dominates public debate all over the world. While we live our lives in relative comfort and security, migrants are leaving their homes forever, losing loved ones, and risking death. Through this performance of <i>Dhana and the Rosebuds</i>, we seek to raise questions, emotions, and doubts. This is a crucial moment, and we want to channel the public attention and raise awareness of this defining phenomenon of our time - migration and immigration.  This performance of <i>Dhana and the Rosebuds</i> explores the  refugee crisis in a more intimate way than the statistical reporting of news outlets through an all-female personal narrative. Dhana's journey is extreme and unique, but it is also universal.  In addition to sustaining live theatre, your donations support a story which elucidates topics such as the evolution of personal identity and the challenge to return to the past in order to embrace the future. </p>
<h3><strong>History of the Performance</strong></h3>
<p>The performance <i>Dhana #Scene49</i> is an adaptation of the original screenplay, <i>Dhana and the Rosebuds</i>, written by Federica Cellini and Giulia Corda, which first appeared on stage in Washington, DC. The performance for the <i>In scena!</i> theatre festival is adapted and directed by Federica Cellini. The cast consists of actors Ali Evarts, Valerie Fenton, Lia Johnson, Lauren Kieler, and Sue Struve. The music is composed and improvised by Irene Jalenti.</p>
<p>Federica Cellini, director and artist, Federica Cellini, defines herself as a storyteller above all.

</div></div>","THE STORY

A young Syrian woman living in New York City has forgotten all about her past, but when she identifies her estranged grandmother on the news among Syrian refugees in the Balkan borders, she embarks on a mission to find her. It will become a spiritual journey to rediscover her roots and her own identity. Dhana is a sort of upside down Greek heroine:  she doesn’t return home after the war, but runs away from peace to find home again in the war. 

Looking for her grandmother, Sham, Syrian-born American Dhana travels to the Balkans at the heart of the migration crisis, across borders and through refugee camps, train stations, and makeshift shelters. Amidst such dramatic circumstances, Dhana gathers a clue to unlocking her identity at every step on her journey. 
 
The Scene (Dhana #Scene49)  Which You Will Help Us Bring to Brooklyn
Inside a tent within a refugee camp, a young Syrian is getting married and all the women around her participate in the ritual to ready her for this special moment. 
While watching these unique circumstances unfold, Dhana finds herself trapped in a suspended dreamlike reality. All women in her present and in her past surround her and merge: her Syrian childhood memories resurface, the ones no bomb could destroy.
Why Support This Performance?
Migration is a topic that dominates public debate all over the world. While we live our lives in relative comfort and security, migrants are leaving their homes forever, losing loved ones, and risking death. Through this performance of Dhana and the Rosebuds, we seek to raise questions, emotions, and doubts. This is a crucial moment, and we want to channel the public attention and raise awareness of this defining phenomenon of our time - migration and immigration.  This performance of Dhana and the Rosebuds explores the  refugee crisis in a more intimate way than the statistical reporting of news outlets through an all-female personal narrative. Dhana's journey is extreme and unique, but it is also universal.  In addition to sustaining live theatre, your donations support a story which elucidates topics such as the evolution of personal identity and the challenge to return to the past in order to embrace the future. 
History of the Performance
The performance Dhana #Scene49 is an adaptation of the original screenplay, Dhana and the Rosebuds, written by Federica Cellini and Giulia Corda, which first appeared on stage in Washington, DC. The performance for the In scena! theatre festival is adapted and directed by Federica Cellini. The cast consists of actors Ali Evarts, Valerie Fenton, Lia Johnson, Lauren Kieler, and Sue Struve. The music is composed and improvised by Irene Jalenti.
Federica Cellini, director and artist, Federica Cellini, defines herself as a storyteller above all. With a journalistic background, her long and creative professional journey is an evolving experiment on trying to achieve her goals in presenting each story in a specific manner. She uses various media in her research, exploring them all to the fullest, mostly focusing on social issues and current affairs. 
The “migration crisis” swallows fears, dreams, and the stories of these people.This journey is too often translated only into numbers building up in news reports. Dhana and the Rosebuds was born from the desire to explore the refugee crisis in a more intimate way. Cellini harnesses the power of live performance to tell the story of a woman whose identity lies at the very heart of the past she is trying to run away from. Bouncing between different places over the years has made her aware of the connections among seemingly distant human beings and of the challenges faced by immigrants.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>“Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines everywhere.”<br/>–William Shakespeare</p>
<p>My name is Will Sanders. I'm a professional clown. I started Fool Foundry in late 2017 because going to France for two years to clown school was a ridiculous notion, especially given all the fabulous talent in my hometown, Houston, TX. Art doesn't come from merely L.A., New York and Chicago. Our diverse, enormous, and economically prosperous city has been producing staggeringly great art for YEARS. </p>
<p>But there is a problem. We in Houston, in Texas, and in the Southwest have failed to participate in the great tradition of theatrical clowning.</p>
<p>Down here, theatrical clowning is a desert. We do have many clowns, mainly of two kinds - Birthday Party clowns and Rodeo clowns. They are funny and important, but limited in scope. This clown, at least in the public eye, is only a caricature of something deeper. This ""High Clown"" has the potential to be more meaningful to audiences, and in my opinion, crucial to our world. Fool Foundry is one answer to bringing high clowning to our community.</p>
<p>So what kinds of clowns qualify as Fool Foundry type clowns? Examples include the great <a href=""https://youtu.be/k4uT3ergY04"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Slava</a> of Slava's Snowshow, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lF0XMCssG0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marcel Marceau</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_ZlsF80iRQ&amp;t=4s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charlie Chaplin</a>, and so, so many others. And though too few Americans realize it, clowning is an ancient tradition, and is internationally recognized as a fine art. It is enjoyed by all in circuses, theatres, opera houses, classrooms, even on the street, and all over the world ...except here. That's why we need your support to build our great community.</p>
<p>Fool Foundry's mission is CHANGE this. I cannot tell you the amazing energy coming from our performers and community at large. They have been begging for something like this for a long long time. With your support, we will build just that!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our very first mission is to send a group of clowns to the Center for Movement Theatre in Washington, DC. <a href=""http://www.thisisthecenter.com/cmt.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thisisthecenter.com/cmt.html</a>, for a workshop running June 4 - 9.<br/>Here, we will begin our training in a wonderful tradition of mask-driven theatre, a starting point to the Clown. To engage with the body this way, is to develop a kind of language of gesture. If you have ever seen a talented mime, who has complete control over the expression of their movement, they likely have had this training.</p>
<ul><li>We need 1,200 dollars. It's not much (well, it's a whole heck-of-a-lot to us!), but it does cover tuition, and travel expenses for two clowns-to-be. We must start this small, as Rome was not build in a 30-day indiegogo. If we surpass this goal, we will invest it into the company, and do bigger, better, theatre. From the class, we will return to Houston and begin performing and offering classes in this heightened form of Clown. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, we will work to expand charitable efforts such as clown doctoring, and serving underprivileged youngsters through performance in schools and Theatre for Young Adults (TYA).</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We've got three rewards for our backers. Performances, Classes and Merch! Enjoy our live and digital performances, t-shirts, wristbands, signed masks (from the video!) and hoodies. Give what you can, and get back our tremendous thanks and thank-you gifts. You've put us one step forward on a very worthy path.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>If we fall short, the funds will be used to partially cover tuition for the mask class. The only difference is that we are that much poorer, and y'all don't get that cool merchandise!</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Clowning, at its best, touches people on a fundamental level. Clowns give us the freedom to feel. They nurture our joy, make us laugh, make us feel safe to be vulnerable. Those who learn the art of clowning are taken back to their childhood selves, back to the place before we learned to judge ourselves, to be embarrassed. Ask yourself, does the world need this kind of empathy?</p>
<p>If you answered, 'yes,' then you understand the stakes: We live in a time when our world and its people are undergoing massive changes. We are ever more divided in an increasingly technological, mechanical age. Anxieties ranging from nuclear war, unending prejudice, and a relentless onslaught of pressure upon our children makes our world a harder place to live, to be happy, to be free. Clowning frees us from these anxieties, shows us we can make mistakes, and helps us to overcome psychological barriers to happiness, such as fear, doubt and cynicism. Clowning can be one answer these problems, but only when we work together.</p>
<ul><li>Apart from receiving our thank you gifts, you will be helping build a wonderful community of artists. As clowns, our primary mission is to make people happy. With your donation, you know that there is more laughter and joy in the world. How awesome is that?!</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>I have been building organizations and businesses since my teenage years. There have been many more failures than successes. I've made more my share of mistakes, all of which have been wonderful learning opportunities. I am excited to funnel all the lessons I have learned into Fool Foundry, and  to continue learning.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>This is your chance to make a difference in more lives than any of us can imagine. From we at Fool Foundry, to our internet audience, to the children that will forget their particular difficulties, your dollars are working, literally to make more people happy. We don't do this stuff to get rich quick. We don't perform to live a charmed, starving artist's life. We do it because we love it, we believe in its power, and we want to make a difference. Please join us as we do just that.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Building an entire art scene from scratch is no easy feat. It will take many, many years to reach the vision I and our team see for ourselves. A simple class in DC may be our starting point, but when we get home, we have to hit the ground running! </p>
<ul></ul>
<p>Fortunately, we already have vendors, performance spaces, clowns, and students lined up. The final pieces are man power for taking care of business needs, such as social networking, legal fees and other necessary expenses. With your donation, we WILL overcome those challenges.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are bakubakubaku, also know as the Dream Eaters Performance Collective, a trio of performers who met in New York City, and have been creating experimental immersive puppetry performances together since 2014. Library of the Dreamless will be the third in a trio of experiments exploring the world of dreaming through the folklore of the Baku, a creature said to devour your dreams. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556878611/xkuqgpbfhskfanvarck4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have been invited to perform Library of the Dreamless at the Prague Quadrennial as part of its PQ:Studio programming this summer, which is a great honor and an opportunity for us to share this new work. Unfortunately, the invitation does not come with any monetary support for travel. As a non-profit group, we are relying on fundraising, donations, and our own funds to make travel for this performance possible. Anything you are able to offer will help make this dream opportunity a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising funds to help cover the flights and lodging in Prague for our three members for the duration of the 2019 Prague Quadrennial. </p>
<p>For those of you who are able to offer a donation, we have a number of fun, unique perks created by the members of our collective that you can choose from. They reflect the themes of our piece, The Library of the Dreamless, and include opportunities to have original artwork created for you around the theme of dreaming. Please check out what is on offer!</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal amount, anything we are able to collect will help us offset the costs of the trip and allow us to continue to develop new projects. Anything collected above our goal will be put toward improving the performance and further opportunities to develop and stage additional performances.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>bakubakubaku seeks to create experimental, immersive performances that provide a shared dream experience for the audience members. To whom do our dreams belong? Who are we without our dreams? We seek to explore our shared humanity through the universal landscapes of dreaming. Your support will allow us to continue these experiments and explorations, giving us and our audiences the opportunity to share in art and in expressions of dreaming.</p>
<p>We are all increasingly relying on a panoply of apps and devices to help regulate and improve our health and wellbeing every day. In order for these apps to work, we have to surrender a lot of our medical and physiological data that we may not even be conscious of ourselves. In Library of the Dreamless, we ask what happens when ‘care’ is overextended and slips into dependency. How much of our data, and how much of our agency, and perhaps even our humanity, do we surrender to get better?</p>

<h3><strong>Production Details</strong></h3>
<p>There has been a crisis of dreaming...In a climate of pervasive fear and perpetual uncertainty, sleepers have been seized by recurrent nightmares. Desperate and anxious, the restless sleepers resorted to the iBaku, a device named after the mythological dream-eater that feeds upon nightmares. At first, they were pacified when they found relief as they yielded their nightmares to the advanced technology of the iBaku. But soon, they grew dependent on the device, feeding it their dreams and even their hopes. Now, these sleepers dwell in the artificial haze of dreamless stupor, hovering between contentment and despair. </p>
<p>All that is left is the Library of the Dreamless, a repository pieced together from the fragments of dreams that were salvaged from the iBaku. Some sleepers have chosen to make their way to these ruins in hope of finding new ways to dream again, even if they must risk living their nightmares. </p>
<p>Library of the Dreamless is an atmospheric, immersive performance, animated by puppetry. It is the third iteration in a series of intimate dream performance experiments exploring the mythology of the dream-eating Baku of Japanese folklore, with puppetry and an immersive environment. In this installment, created specifically for the Prague Quadrennial PQ:Studio, audiences are invited to experience the show in small groups of 15, as they inhabit the role of sleepers navigating the surreal landscapes of the Library of the Dreamless. The performance is a response to the collection of personal data and the role the tech community currently plays in that collection. </p>
<p>The mythological Baku is a creature from Japanese folklore that consumes nightmares. When someone has experienced a nightmare, the Baku is summoned by calling out its name three times. However, over-dependence on the Baku may also lead to it devouring the individual’s hopes and desires. In the Library of the Dreamless, the Baku is now incarnated as a device-based app, where the excessive dependence on it has led to the point where people have forgotten how to dream and even hope. The apps are effective not only because of the technology but because of the design of its social interface, built to cultivate and manipulate that very dependence. There is a quasi-sentience endowed upon the Baku that is reminiscent of the social robots that we are familiar with today.</p>
<h3><strong>Performance Details</strong></h3>
<p>PQ Studio: Festival, Prague 13 &amp; 14 June 2019</p>
<p>At the invitation of the Prague Quadrennial Studio Festival (PQ Studio), members of the bakubakubaku collective will be staging an intimate performance-installation animated by puppetry, in which audiences become sleepers navigating the uncanny world of the iBaku. Each performance is for a maximum of 15 people, and will take place in the Řetízek Studio (located in DAMU, the Theatre Faculty of The Academy of Performing Arts in Prague). There will be three shows presented over two days.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are bakubakubaku, also know as the Dream Eaters Performance Collective, a trio of performers who met in New York City, and have been creating experimental immersive puppetry performances together since 2014. Library of the Dreamless will be the third in a trio of experiments exploring the world of dreaming through the folklore of the Baku, a creature said to devour your dreams. 
We have been invited to perform Library of the Dreamless at the Prague Quadrennial as part of its PQ:Studio programming this summer, which is a great honor and an opportunity for us to share this new work. Unfortunately, the invitation does not come with any monetary support for travel. As a non-profit group, we are relying on fundraising, donations, and our own funds to make travel for this performance possible. Anything you are able to offer will help make this dream opportunity a reality.

What We Need & What You Get
We are raising funds to help cover the flights and lodging in Prague for our three members for the duration of the 2019 Prague Quadrennial. 
For those of you who are able to offer a donation, we have a number of fun, unique perks created by the members of our collective that you can choose from. They reflect the themes of our piece, The Library of the Dreamless, and include opportunities to have original artwork created for you around the theme of dreaming. Please check out what is on offer!
Even if we don't reach our goal amount, anything we are able to collect will help us offset the costs of the trip and allow us to continue to develop new projects. Anything collected above our goal will be put toward improving the performance and further opportunities to develop and stage additional performances.

The Impact
bakubakubaku seeks to create experimental, immersive performances that provide a shared dream experience for the audience members. To whom do our dreams belong? Who are we without our dreams? We seek to explore our shared humanity through the universal landscapes of dreaming. Your support will allow us to continue these experiments and explorations, giving us and our audiences the opportunity to share in art and in expressions of dreaming.
We are all increasingly relying on a panoply of apps and devices to help regulate and improve our health and wellbeing every day. In order for these apps to work, we have to surrender a lot of our medical and physiological data that we may not even be conscious of ourselves. In Library of the Dreamless, we ask what happens when ‘care’ is overextended and slips into dependency. How much of our data, and how much of our agency, and perhaps even our humanity, do we surrender to get better?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>In a working class town in the UK, five creatives struggle to make a living out of their chosen careers as poverty, exclusivity and lack of opportunity continues to hold them back. Forced to sign on at Universal Credit, the group find it difficult to stay hopeful that things will change as the system that is meant to help them only pushes them further down the drain.</i></p>
<p><i>Throughout the summer of 2018, against a backdrop of scorching heat and the World Cup, the five friends battle societal and financial hurdles as they try to find ways to get the same opportunities as everyone else.</i></p>
<p>This play has been born of my own experiences as well as those of friends, family and former colleagues; experiences of being working class, of living in culturally impoverished towns, of the soul-crushing experiences of being on Universal Credit, the treatment and judgement of being unemployed, the struggle to find work, <i>any</i> work, the lack of help and lack of encouragement from both society and the government. </p>
<p>However, as stated, one of the themes of the play is the lack of opportunities for working class creatives, especially those over the age of 26, to get into the industry. Therefore, my intent is, from this play, to start a theatre company where other work can be produced, allowing opportunities for all working class creatives, with the hope that, if one person, one company, can't solve the problem entirely, it can at least make a dent in it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where the Funding Goes</h3>
<p>It takes a lot to bring a show together and so, to make this play happen, lots of things, both big and small, are needed. And for all of these things, we need funding. Even when keeping the budget as low as possible, there's some essential costs that just can't be avoided (and unfortunately, people don't accept Monopoly money. Believe me, I've tried). Therefore your contribution can help pay for the following things</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal spaces (essential for ensuring actors don't walk into tables or each other)</li>
<li>Theatre space (so we have somewhere to actually put on the show that isn't in our own heads)</li>
<li>Photography (Because as beautiful as our cast selfies inevitably are...they don't really have that professional trust-in-our-performance vibe)</li>
<li>Props (because we don't want to be miming typing on a laptop. That could get weird)</li>
<li>Costumes (As naked actors makes for a very different kind of show)</li>
<li>Flyers and posters (so people can know the show exists!)</li>
<li>Programs (so people can remember the show and can learn more about the people who made it happen. Also helps as proof the show wasn't imagined and actually happened)</li>
<li>Script printing (So our cast don't have to keep squinting at that phones for their lines in rehearsal. Also so they can doodle on scripts while pretending their taking important notes. We've all done it)</li>
</ul>
<p>The play is working as a profit-share performance, meaning the greater profit we make, the more our hard working cast and crew will earn. Therefore, the more of these things listed above that can be paid with funding, the greater the profit-share will be, which means not only will our cast and crew have a happy pay day for their work, but it increases the likelihood of being able to do more shows in the future, and really get a theatre company going that has access for working classes to get into the arts. So your contribution can go a really, <i>really</i> long way! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, this play does come from personal experiences, both my own and that of friends, family and colleagues. I had, originally, believed these struggles to be unique to my own situation, but it was only when speaking with others, that I came to realise these experiences, theses frustrations and barriers, were shared across all industries, all areas of the working class. The increasing lack of work alongside the increasing lack of understanding of how difficult it is to find employment, the pressure everyone feels to give up on their careers simply because they're too poor to pursue it. </p>
<p>I wanted to create something that exposed this, shared those stories, in an engaging  and entertaining way, and it was as I listened to people's stories, their stories of living below poverty lines, of struggling with their careers, the negative, debilitating experiences of being on Universal Credit, that this play started to develop. </p>
<p>I come from a working class single parent family, I am working class, so is my Mother, so were my grandparents, great-grandparents, and I have been raised in a working class town, in the north, where there is much less culture and access to the arts than you find in other areas of the country. Where there is less money, there is less arts, and this not only deprives an audience of experiences, but it deprives the creatives living there of work. </p>
<p>Therefore, I want this play to not just be about telling this story, but also about <i>creating</i> work for those very people it talks about. Job opportunities for everything from actors and directors to FOH and ASMs; my aim is, from this play, to create other productions, other opportunities, through a theatre company that will give work opportunities to the working classes, to help those without privilege or aid, those who are too old for the 16-26 program cut-offs, or live outside of the Greater London area location cut-off,  to get that first foot in the door. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Hurdle. </h3>
<p>The greatest hurdle for this project is....money. The very thing this play is about, lack of funding, lack of access, lack of help, are the very same hurdles we face in making this play happen. Everything costs, and even the smallest things do build up over the course of production, and,  as explored in the play, being working class, having no personal finances to fall back on, so often ideas never come to fruition, not because the passion isn't there, but because the money isn't. </p>
<p>I want to be able to use this play as a launchpad for starting a theatre company, a company that specialises in giving opportunities to creatives from the working class, especially women, as it is even harder for working class women than working class men, to find work in these industries: there are fewer female roles, fewer opportunities for female directors, fewer chances taken on female writers. </p>
<p>Through this play, and through the eventual company it will be attached to, I want to help tackle these problems, to start putting a dent in the issues, but that can't begin if we don't have the money to get it rolling. All other hurdles can be overcome by determination, passion, talent, collaboration, an entire team...but no amount of sheer will can make money appear where it doesn't exist. </p>
<p>The biggest hurdle is the funding, but the great news is that that is <i>exactly</i> when <i>you</i> can help! </p>
</div><div>

<p>My name is Nisha Hope. I was born on the beautiful Caribbean island,St. Vincent and the Grenadines. I have over 15 years experience in theatre and I am currently in the final semester of my undergraduate studies. Contributions from this campaign will enable the successful staging of a play that I will pen and direct, in partial fulfillment of my BFA in Creative Arts degree. </p>
<p>It's important for me to mount this play because our country has been seeing an increase in the homicide rate within the last 5 years. I've not only lost friends to the upsurge of violence but I myself was a victim of a robbery at my own home.</p>
<p>While I feel persons are generally sensitised about the crime situation, there is a need for more research to figure out what are the enablers of homicides while finding effective ways to re-humanize a society that was once peaceful and a tourist attraction.  </p>
<p>I really hope to be the voice that allows for deeper discussion and I trust my play will speak to the humanity of its viewers.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What's Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise $3000.00 to be able to stage this play that offers its viewers value. All of the monies raised will go towards preparing for the play during the 6 week rehearsal process, creating the set design, purchasing props, costumes and paying cast and crew. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a student of The University of the West Indies, I have a captive audience. The UWI boasts a student population of over 7000 that spans across 40 countries globally through our exchange program. It also offers an opportunity to Vincentian students to start the discussion and prepare them for the reality upon returning to the home they call Hairouna. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles in achieving my goal may be human resources and networking as I am mounting the play in Barbados as a foreign student and not familiar with local artists. However, I have started fairly early to cast and I believe this hurdle will be a small one. </p>

<p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hello! </strong>I’m Jenny Rocha, choreographer and founder of Rocha Dance Theater. I’m also a performer, costume designer and teaching artist and I’m based in Brooklyn, NY. For my current repertoire, Battledress, I’m working with longtime company members, Jillian Hollis and Courtney Drasner, as well as composer and husband, Joseph Rivas. We have all been involved in the creative process for Battledress since its first commission in 2013 by The Boston Center for the Arts. Since then, the work has been performed at The Philadelphia Museum of Art, Roger Williams University, New Bedford Art Museum, MANA Contemporary and Baryshnikov Arts Center.</p>
<p><strong>What’s Next?</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Battledress</i></strong><strong>: The Azores Premiere &amp; Workshop Series</strong></p>
<p>Rocha Dance Theater will be participating in their first international tour to Azores, Portugal this September. Myself, Jillian Hollis and Courtney Drasner will perform a trio version of the repertoire at a local theater Teatro Ribeiragrandense. My husband, Joe Rivas, who composed the music for <i>Battledress, </i>will also attend, documenting the workshop and performance.</p>
<p>With the support of a grant from the US Embassy in Lisbon, we were able to incorporate a crucial arts education component to this project: Prior to the performance, I will lead a 5 day workshop for students ages 13-18, teaching a modern technique class and teaching a section of <i>Battledress</i>. At the end of the week, the students will have an opportunity to perform the piece as part of our show. </p>
<p><strong>What are we asking?</strong></p>
<p>While the grant from The US Embassy in Lisbon covers airfare and the workshops that I’m leading, the company still needs to raise an additional $5,000 to make this project happen. I hope that you will consider a donation towards RDT’s first international workshop and performance! Your support is greatly appreciated, and will be used to cultivate a cultural exchange in dance, support equitable artists fees, and promote access to dance education.</p>
<p><strong>Perks!</strong></p>
<p>In addition to supporting all of the artists and communities served, you will also receive some amazing perks! Take a peek and learn some Portuguese while you're at it!</p>
<p><strong>Funds will go towards the Azores tour and the company whether or not the goal is reached. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Description of work</strong></p>
<p><i>Battledress</i> challenges preconceptions of the female by juxtaposing stereotypical femininity with powerful figures clad in protective armour. At times, the women are held captive in unwanted cages; later, they are stern, statuesque, performing gestures of authority. The performance depicts an internal battle as its characters attempt to deconstruct their assigned roles, presenting an alternate reality that is at once dream-like and relatable.</p>

<p><strong>About The Azores!</strong></p>
<p>The Azores is one of two autonomous regions of Portugal. It is an archipelago composed of nine volcanic islands in the North Atlantic Ocean about 850 miles west of continental Portugal. There are nine major Azorean islands and an islet cluster, in three main groups. These are Flores and Corvo, to the west; Graciosa. Terceira, Sao Jorge, Pico and Faial in the center; and Sao Miguel, Santa Maria to the east.  The islands are characterized by dramatic landscapes, fishing villages, green pastures and hedgerows of blue hydrangeas. São Miguel, the largest, has lake-filled calderas (volcanic craters), natural hot springs and the Gorreana Tea Plantation.</p>

<p>Két évvel ezelőtt egy szép őszi napon megcsörrent a telefonom, és egy ismeretlen cég ismeretlenen alkalmazottja megkért, azonosítsam magam.</p>
<p>Azt, hogy miért hívott többszöri kérésemre sem közölte, egyre csak a személyes adataim iránt érdeklődött. Természetesen semmit nem mondtam el Neki, és az abszurd drámába illő beszélgetést posztoltam a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/folyougy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook falamra</a>.</p>
<p>A telefonhívások ez után rendszeressé váltak és egyre furcsábbak, röhejesebbek lettek, így kénytelen voltam minduntalan posztolni azokat. A hívások két év után nem rég maradtak abba. Ez alatt a két év alatt nem csak telefonbeszélgetéseket, hanem velem megesett városi sztorikat, párbeszédeket is írogattam.</p>
<p>A posztok egyre népszerűbbek lettek, egyre többen követték a történeteket, köztük kortárs írók, színészek, rendezők is, akik meggyőztek: írjak darabot a párbeszédekből. A szövegkönyv el is készült, az utolsó simítások vannak már csak hátra, az RS9 Színház pedig bevállalta, hogy áprilisban műsorra tűzi a darabot, melyet kis költségvetéssel már öt teltházas előadás árából meg is tudunk valósítani.</p>

<h2>Mire fordítjuk a támogatásokat? Céljaink. </h2>
<h3>Célok: </h3>
<p>A kampány során elsősorban a bemutató és az első öt előadás személyi költségeire gyűjtünk (ezért a kis költségvetés), hogy ki tudjuk fizetni a színészeket, a rendezőt, és a technikai személyzetet.  Négy színésszel, és a rendezővel számolva a próbafolyamatra 5 x 375 dollárt szeretnénk költeni, míg a darab technikai megvalósulására 200 dollárt. Természetesen nem csak próbapénzt, hanem előadásonként is szeretnénk fizetni a stábnak, 5 x 40 dollárt, plusz a technikai személyzetnek 25 dollárt. Így az előadás megvalósulásának minimális, de elégséges költségvetése $3200.</p>
<h3><strong>Mérföldkövek:</strong></h3>
<p>Ha elérjük az alapcélt, folytatjuk a kampány, hogy a lehető legjobb minőségű előadást láthassátok áprilisban az RS9 Színházban. Ehhez szükségünk van a látványosabb díszlethez, jelmezhez, és kelléktárhoz szükséges forrásokra.</p>

<li value=""3"">MÉRFÖLDKŐ: DÍSZLET - $2500<br/>Nem csak karakterből lesz sok a színpadon, de helyszínből is, ha volna lehetőségünk, szívesen bevonnánk a darab megvalósításába olyan különleges (és drága) színpadi technikát, melyeket jól lehet kis színpadon még nem is alkalmaztak ezelőtt.

</div></div>","A Folyügyről

Két évvel ezelőtt egy szép őszi napon megcsörrent a telefonom, és egy ismeretlen cég ismeretlenen alkalmazottja megkért, azonosítsam magam.
Azt, hogy miért hívott többszöri kérésemre sem közölte, egyre csak a személyes adataim iránt érdeklődött. Természetesen semmit nem mondtam el Neki, és az abszurd drámába illő beszélgetést posztoltam a Facebook falamra.
A telefonhívások ez után rendszeressé váltak és egyre furcsábbak, röhejesebbek lettek, így kénytelen voltam minduntalan posztolni azokat. A hívások két év után nem rég maradtak abba. Ez alatt a két év alatt nem csak telefonbeszélgetéseket, hanem velem megesett városi sztorikat, párbeszédeket is írogattam.
A posztok egyre népszerűbbek lettek, egyre többen követték a történeteket, köztük kortárs írók, színészek, rendezők is, akik meggyőztek: írjak darabot a párbeszédekből. A szövegkönyv el is készült, az utolsó simítások vannak már csak hátra, az RS9 Színház pedig bevállalta, hogy áprilisban műsorra tűzi a darabot, melyet kis költségvetéssel már öt teltházas előadás árából meg is tudunk valósítani.
Segíts, hogy megvalósulhasson az előadás! Röhögjünk együtt 2017 áprilisában!
Braun Barna vagyok, az ELTE BTK Irodalom és kultúratudomány mesterszakán végeztem, ezzel párhuzamosan kezdtem el az RS9 Színházban dolgozni mint PR-os és kommunikációs referens, az elmúlt két évben rengeteget tanultam itt a színházszakmáról, amely azóta nem csak a munkám, hanem szenvedélyem lett.
Előtte hasonló pozícióban a József Attila Kör irodalmi egyesületnél dolgoztam, az én ötletem alapján valósult meg pl. 2014-ben a népszerű ""búspoéták"" pólócsalád. 10 éve alapítottam a FÉLonline.hu nevű független kulturális-művészeti folyóiratot, melynek estjeit magam szervezem a színházi esemény-menedzsment feladatok mellett.
Dolgoztam már szabadúszó újságíróként, írtam konferencia előadást, tanulmányt, sőt még verseket is, ez lesz az első drámám. 

Csáki Rita kollégám, barátom az RS9 Színház lelke. Amit a színházcsinálásról tudok, azt tőle tanultam. Kiváló rendező, a háta mögött sok sikeres, népszerű RS9-es darabbal.

Amikor először felmerült, hogy színdarab készüljön a Folyóügyből, nem volt számomra kérdés, hogy Őt kérjem fel a rendezésre.

Társadalmi üzenet
2015 nyarán a 24.hu-n riport készült az abszurd telefonbeszélgetésekről. A cikkben megszólaló ügyvéd megalapozta a Folyóügy társadalmi üzenetét, hiszen 
""Dr. Székely Andrea, ügyvéd szerint, amit a követeléskezelő cég művel, az törvénytelen. Szimpla zaklatás, de lehetséges, hogy eddig bevált nekik a módszer. A tények: a követeléskezelő cég tényleg nem beszélhet meg egy ismeretlennel egy ügyet: azonosítaniuk kell az ügyfelet. Braun Barna viszont a lehető leghelyesebben jár el, amikor nem adja ki akárkinek a személyes adatait, hiszen azokkal bárki visszaélhet.""
A sztorikra többen úgy reagáltak: mióta olvasták az párbeszédeket és a cikket, bátrabban mondanak nemet a zaklató telefonokra, s ha már csak egy néző is tudni fogja, hogyan kell reagálni egy ilyen helyzetben megéri elkészíteni a darabot.

<h2>We are The NOW Collective! </h2>
<h3>A theatre company providing a collaborative environment for artists to develop and share new stories. </h3>
<p>This spring, we will be hosting two workshop productions at our favorite downtown theater space, Access Theater! Join us in experiencing the work of two up-and-coming playwrights in The NOW Collective community, Matthew McLachlan and Terilyn Elise Eisenhauer! </p>
<p><strong>Donate at least $10 and get 25% off a ticket to each production! That means if you give $10 now, you will a $10 discount when you come see both shows!</strong></p>
<p>With these workshop productions,  we’re encouraging you to engage in conversation with our playwrights, actors, directors, and production team to see what a show in-process looks like.  </p>
<p>But before we continue, we’d like to thank YOU for your support throughout the years. With our reading series and our full fledged production of <i>The Wild Parrots Of Campbell </i>in December you’ve supported us throughout this packed season of productions and now, we’re just asking for you to help us with the <strong>final push of $5,000</strong>.</p>
<p>The NOW Collective was founded to not only give theater artists the opportunity to collaborate with a supportive, dynamic community, but to also raise back the curtain, see what happens behind the scenes, hear our audience’s voices, and include you in the conversation. Join us as we wrap up this season to bring you the consistent work The NOW Collective is known for!</p>
<p>We have chosen two shows to be part of the new <a href=""https://www.nowcollective.org/workshopseries"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NOW Workshop Series</a>: <i>The Murder Play with Jack &amp; Melissa</i> by Matthew McLachlan, and <i>Lovelocked</i> by Terilyn Elise Eisenhauer. Both shows have been previously developed in the NOW Reading Series and will be staged for the very first time in the NOW Workshop Series! But that’s not all… the team will be highlighting a specific design element that is inherent to successful storytelling of each play. We’re excited to be finishing our season strong with these two new plays!</p>
<p><i>The Murder Play with Jack &amp; Melissa</i> takes the audience to a cabin on a mountain during a rain storm. Melissa wakes up to find herself taped to a chair and in the company of a kind-hearted serial killer named Jack...and he just wants a friend. This comedy explores the outrageous things we do to not feel so lonely, and the outrageous people we do it with. This two-hander involves a lot of fake blood. Special FX with props and costumes will be the highlighted tech element for this show. <i>The </i><i>Murder Play with Jack &amp; Melissa</i> runs March 18-22!</p>
<p><i>Lovelocked</i> tells the story of Killian and his pet rabbit living on the Ha'Penny Bridge in Dublin. One night, Patrick Foran, a local city councilman, offers to share his whiskey, and the story of Killian and Caoimhe unfolds. Where did she go? Why did she leave? And how long will Killian wait for her return? Lovelocked features a cast of three. The story plays with time and changing locations in an instant. The highlighted tech element for this show will be Lighting Design, which will help guide the audience through the story, and differentiate the multiple locations and realities. <i>Lovelocked</i> runs May 13-18!</p>
<p>Both shows will be in The Black Box at <a href=""http://www.accesstheater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Access Theatre</a>. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>This is the <strong>final push</strong> for the remaining $5,000 to make TWO shows happen! <br/>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<p>Actor Fees: $1,000<br/>Writer Fees: $200<br/>Director Fees: $500<br/><i>Murder Play</i> Props/SFX Designer Fee: $200<br/><i>Lovelocked</i> Lighting Designer: $200<br/>Master Electrician: $250<br/>Design Team: $450<br/><i>**Murder Play</i> Props/SFX Budget: $1,000<br/>Stage Management &amp; ASM Fees: $800<br/><i>*Murder Play</i> Fight Director: $200<br/><i>*Lovelocked</i> Dialect Coach: $200<br/><strong>TOTAL: $5,000!</strong></p>
<p>*In both productions, although the plays are still in progress, we’re asking our directors, actors, and entire design team to create a polished piece of theater. Each production has a little something extra that requires a special addition to the production team. For the actors safety, we will be hiring a Fight Director for <i>The Murder Play with Jack &amp; Melissa</i>. Since <i>Lovelocked</i> is set in Ireland, a dialect coach helps our actors speech with the natural cadence and tones of an Irish accent!</p>
<p>**We don't want to give anything away, but <i>Murder Play</i> is going to be a messy 5 day run!</p>
<h3>
<br/>What You Get</h3>
<p>By donating at least $10 you will get a personalized discount code for <strong>25% off</strong> a ticket to BOTH shows and a special thanks in our program! If you come see both productions, you will get a $10 savings when you donate $10.</p>
<p>Note: There is no perk to “claim”. Every person that donates will receive a discount code! So, you may give more than $10 if you'd like! You will receive an email from us with your individualized discount code shortly after you make your donation. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As you know, The NOW Collective supports the in-process generation of new work. With your help, we create an environment for playwrights to develop their plays alongside a cast and creative team. And we love giving our community a behind-the-scenes aspect of theater making. But most of all, two playwrights get to have their plays produced.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The NOW Collective makes indie theatre because we weren't seeing the kind of shows that our community is craving! There was a call for new work founded in collaboration, so we became a source. We dream big and take risks, that's why we've been so successful in the past. We introduced two new kinds of programming this season, our World Premiere Productions and our Workshop Series, which have given us three new plays in our 2019-2020 season. The first, the world premiere of <i><a href=""https://www.nowcollective.org/parrots"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Wild Parrots of Campbell</a>, </i>was a huge success for everyone involved! The 16-performance run at The Cherry Lane Studio Theater got raving reviews from <a href=""https://www.broadwayworld.com/off-off-broadway/article/BWW-Review-Squawking-slackers-in-the-compelling-world-premiere-THE-WILD-PARROTS-OF-CAMPBELL-from-NOW-Collective-at-Cherry-Lane-Studio-Theatre-20191210"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">critics</a> and audiences. The second, is our Workshop Series featuring <i>The Murder Play with Jack and Melissa</i> and <i>Lovelocked</i>. </p>
<p>We just need that final $5,000 for the Workshop Series to be successful! That's why we are reaching out to you. We understand The NOW Collective community, close friends, and family just donated back in September. We are so thankful for that! We are reaching out in case there were others who didn't get to give before or people generous enough to donate again!<br/> </p>

This spring, we will be hosting two workshop productions at our favorite downtown theater space, Access Theater! Join us in experiencing the work of two up-and-coming playwrights in The NOW Collective community, Matthew McLachlan and Terilyn Elise Eisenhauer! 
Donate at least $10 and get 25% off a ticket to each production! That means if you give $10 now, you will a $10 discount when you come see both shows!
With these workshop productions,  we’re encouraging you to engage in conversation with our playwrights, actors, directors, and production team to see what a show in-process looks like.  
But before we continue, we’d like to thank YOU for your support throughout the years. With our reading series and our full fledged production of The Wild Parrots Of Campbell in December you’ve supported us throughout this packed season of productions and now, we’re just asking for you to help us with the final push of $5,000.
The NOW Collective was founded to not only give theater artists the opportunity to collaborate with a supportive, dynamic community, but to also raise back the curtain, see what happens behind the scenes, hear our audience’s voices, and include you in the conversation. Join us as we wrap up this season to bring you the consistent work The NOW Collective is known for!
We have chosen two shows to be part of the new NOW Workshop Series: The Murder Play with Jack & Melissa by Matthew McLachlan, and Lovelocked by Terilyn Elise Eisenhauer. Both shows have been previously developed in the NOW Reading Series and will be staged for the very first time in the NOW Workshop Series! But that’s not all… the team will be highlighting a specific design element that is inherent to successful storytelling of each play. We’re excited to be finishing our season strong with these two new plays!
The Murder Play with Jack & Melissa takes the audience to a cabin on a mountain during a rain storm. Melissa wakes up to find herself taped to a chair and in the company of a kind-hearted serial killer named Jack...and he just wants a friend. This comedy explores the outrageous things we do to not feel so lonely, and the outrageous people we do it with. This two-hander involves a lot of fake blood. Special FX with props and costumes will be the highlighted tech element for this show. The Murder Play with Jack & Melissa runs March 18-22!
Lovelocked tells the story of Killian and his pet rabbit living on the Ha'Penny Bridge in Dublin. One night, Patrick Foran, a local city councilman, offers to share his whiskey, and the story of Killian and Caoimhe unfolds. Where did she go? Why did she leave? And how long will Killian wait for her return? Lovelocked features a cast of three. The story plays with time and changing locations in an instant. The highlighted tech element for this show will be Lighting Design, which will help guide the audience through the story, and differentiate the multiple locations and realities. Lovelocked runs May 13-18!
Both shows will be in The Black Box at Access Theatre.  

What We Need
This is the final push for the remaining $5,000 to make TWO shows happen! Here's the breakdown:
Actor Fees: $1,000Writer Fees: $200Director Fees: $500Murder Play Props/SFX Designer Fee: $200Lovelocked Lighting Designer: $200Master Electrician: $250Design Team: $450**Murder Play Props/SFX Budget: $1,000Stage Management & ASM Fees: $800*Murder Play Fight Director: $200*Lovelocked Dialect Coach: $200TOTAL: $5,000!
*In both productions, although the plays are still in progress, we’re asking our directors, actors, and entire design team to create a polished piece of theater. Each production has a little something extra that requires a special addition to the production team. For the actors safety, we will be hiring a Fight Director for The Murder Play with Jack & Melissa. Since Lovelocked is set in Ireland, a dialect coach helps our actors speech with the natural cadence and tones of an Irish accent!
**We don't want to give anything away, but Murder Play is going to be a messy 5 day run!

What You Get
By donating at least $10 you will get a personalized discount code for 25% off a ticket to BOTH shows and a special thanks in our program! If you come see both productions, you will get a $10 savings when you donate $10.
Note: There is no perk to “claim”. Every person that donates will receive a discount code! So, you may give more than $10 if you'd like! You will receive an email from us with your individualized discount code shortly after you make your donation. 

The Impact
As you know, The NOW Collective supports the in-process generation of new work. With your help, we create an environment for playwrights to develop their plays alongside a cast and creative team. And we love giving our community a behind-the-scenes aspect of theater making. But most of all, two playwrights get to have their plays produced.

 
Risks & Challenges
The NOW Collective makes indie theatre because we weren't seeing the kind of shows that our community is craving! There was a call for new work founded in collaboration, so we became a source. We dream big and take risks, that's why we've been so successful in the past. We introduced two new kinds of programming this season, our World Premiere Productions and our Workshop Series, which have given us three new plays in our 2019-2020 season. The first, the world premiere of The Wild Parrots of Campbell, was a huge success for everyone involved! The 16-performance run at The Cherry Lane Studio Theater got raving reviews from critics and audiences. The second, is our Workshop Series featuring The Murder Play with Jack and Melissa and Lovelocked. 
We just need that final $5,000 for the Workshop Series to be successful! That's why we are reaching out to you. We understand The NOW Collective community, close friends, and family just donated back in September. We are so thankful for that! We are reaching out in case there were others who didn't get to give before or people generous enough to donate again!

<p>When Texas Light Opera (TLO) was founded, its principle desire was to popularize classical work and music materials through new theatrical productions. Last year TLO was presented with multiple Alamo Theatre Arts Council Awards and Broadway World awards including “Best Musical” for its small professional touring production of “The Last Five Years,” by Jason Robert Brown. TLO now partners with Aria Creative Productions to present a unique production of <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> this Summer. The smash rock musical touches on themes such as love and loss, overcoming personal tragedy, the power dynamics inherent in human relationships, mental illness and issues of gender and identity.</p>
<p><i>Hedwig</i> opened Off-Broadway in 1998 and won the Obie Award and Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Off-Broadway Musical. The story follows Hedwig Robinson (Roy Thomas), a transgender East German singer of a fictional rock and roll band, who is the victim of a botched sex change operation which has left him, now her, with just “an angry inch”. The fourth-wall smashing rock signer’s relentless search for love and her other half is performed in song and monologue in the form of a rock gig backed by her band ‘The Angry Inch’. Notable songs painting the picture include “The Origin of Love” and “Sugar Daddy”. Multi-Award Winning Actress and Director, Morgan Clyde, will play the role of Yitzhak, one of Hedwig’s love interests and singers in the band. </p>
<p>The music is steeped in the androgynous 1970s glam rock style of David Bowie (who co-produced the Los Angeles production of the show), as well as the work of John Lennon and early punk performers Lou Reed and Iggy Pop.</p>
<p>The story draws on writer Mitchell's life as the son of a U.S. Army Major General who once commanded the U.S. sector of occupied West Berlin. The character of Hedwig was inspired by a German divorced U.S. Army wife who was Mitchell's family babysitter and moonlighted as a prostitute at her trailer park home in Junction City, Kansas.  “It’s been ten years since it has been here in San Antonio and I couldn’t be more thrilled to reprise the role of Hedwig”, says Roy Thomas, actor and co-producer.  “Our production is a conglomeration of a theatrical performance, rock concert, and standup/improv. The performers routinely interact with the audience and break through the fourth wall”, he says.</p>
<p>Performances will feature pre-show opening acts from local performance troupes including musicians, street performers, drag artists and burlesque performers. Vendors and local artists will sell their wares and creations in our lobby before and after the show. The Saturday afternoon performance will be a charity show benefit for Fiesta Youth, Pride San Antonio and American Veterans for Equal Rights. We hope to shine a spotlight on our local artists and charities and further help to enrich our community. A small reception will be held after each performance to meet, greet and network. The benefiting charities provide much needed social services benefiting LGBT persons and youth in our community.</p>
<p>From East Berlin to Junction City, Kansas and beyond, Hedwig’s story is outrageous, hilarious, and at times, unexpectedly poignant and surprisingly truthful. <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> is a rocking ride that’s sure to inspire anyone who has felt life gave them an inch when they deserved a mile.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>

<p>As a small production company we need your support to that we can pay for wigs (lots or wigs!), costumes, amazing lights and sound fitting for a rock concert. Oh, and we need to transform a large church space into a trailer park and a club!  So there's lot's of set work to do! We have an amazing team of designers and can't wait to see their ideas come to life and transport our audience into the life of Hedwig! </p>

The arts and culture represent one of the few areas in our society where people can come together to share an experience even if they see the world in radically different ways.

In art and other forms of cultural expression, disagreement is accepted and embraced as an essential ingredient. In this sense, the community created by arts and culture is potentially a great source of inspiration for politicians and activists who work to transcend the polarising populism and stigmatisation of other people, positions, and worldviews that is sadly so endemic in public discourse today.</li>

In this sense, the community created by arts and culture is potentially a great source of inspiration for politicians and activists who work to transcend the polarising populism and stigmatisation of other people, positions, and worldviews that is sadly so endemic in public discourse today.
With 7 years of award winning productions and critical praise, you support allows us to continue this tradition of impacting our community thru art.
The simple truth is, we need you to help us continue this artistic experience, by doing so we will strive to spread the value of your support to audiences far and wide.


Risks & Challenges

For 7 years we have thought outside the box to bring quality theatre to our supporters. As a company we have embraced the challenges of finding spaces and funding thru different  avenues along with investments of our own personal funds and resources. While always a challenge, we have always found a way..  
As we finalize production and planning, we know that we can count on our audience and contributors to help us once again achieve our goals and continue our tradition of bringing quality productions, unique experiences and artistic opportunities to those who join us for this cause. #ITSALLABOUTTHEART

<h3>Hey! What's this all about? Well, let us tell you.</h3>
<p>Front Porch Improv (FPI) is a high-quality, creative, progressive, and community-based improv comedy group in Savannah, GA. We currently have 25 company members, 80+ students, and regularly teach workshops for local non-profits, businesses, and schools. Savannah Magazine voted us the Best Comedy Group 2019. (Thanks, Savannah Magazine!) We believe that having fun, being weird, and making good art is vitally important to the community.</p>
<p>Currently, we have no theatre and we move from spot to spot, performing at any place we can find. While that sounds fun, we spend a huge chunk of our energy and time lugging equipment, setting up and taking down things like our stages, lights, sound equipment, curtain, seats, etc.  Plus, it makes it hard for audiences to find us.</p>
<p>We need a place to call our own...and we found a fantastic spot. A 3,000 square-foot space in the Starland District of Savannah. This building is an awesome blank slate that we can make into a versatile theatre, rehearsal area, bar, and workshop space, dedicated to growing affordable, high-quality improv theatre and comedy. What a time to be alive!</p>
<p>Are we going to stop there? Ummm, no!  FPI looks forward to supporting other artists in their creative goals. We’ll be booking other performers with fun, amazing, groundbreaking shows. Everything from a one-woman play to a Little Mermaid sing-along will be welcome in our space. Got an amateur wrestling team? Call Front Porch Improv and we’ll have a space for you to show off those sweet piledrivers. </p>
<p>FPI will also have a dedicated workshop space where we can offer even more classes for adults and businesses than we do now. We plan to expand our programs to kids as well. We look forward to seeing all those tiny improvisors saying “Yes, and!” Moreover, we will bolster our efforts to have our performers and students represent the entire community here in Savannah by providing more scholarships to people of color, LGBTQ+ people, and the disabled, so that everyone has a chance to create.</p>
<p>Front Porch Improv believes that laughing helps bring people together. We have an amazing opportunity to move into our new space, 210 W Victory, and transform it into a hub for creative people here in Savannah. To realize that vision, though, we need your help and support.</p>
<p>Join us and help make Front Porch Improv’s vision a reality. When you contribute to our efforts, you will receive exclusive donation rewards — like an original song from our improv team, your own private improv party, or even your own personalized Savannah for Morons romper!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are fundraising for $50,000. The entire cost of the project is roughly $110,000. We are putting in $40,000 of our own money and plan to fundraise and take out a business loan for the rest. It's just crazy enough to work.</li>
<li>The money that we raise will be used for HVAC ($25,000), electrical ($12,500), plumbing ($16,000), and basic theatre necessities like lighting, chairs, and the stage.</li>
<li>We have a ton of creative people in our community and we have awesome perks when you donate including personalized videos, private parties, boat rides, rompers, posters, shows, costumes, t-shirts, parking spaces, and more.</li>
<li>Along the way — every time we hit a new milestone (10K, 20K, 30K, 40K and 50K) — we will have pop-up events (online and in-person) as a thank you to our supporters. Expect free shows, ice cream parties, personalized songs &amp; videos, love letters, and more. Our plan is to make this as much fun as possible. Weirdness will ensue.</li>

<li>Front Porch Improv has a community of people who love performing and watching comedy, theatre &amp; music. Having a connection to your community is vital and we proudly provide that.</li>
<li>The arts are important! If you don't believe us go talk to teachers, social workers, parents, and more. They know that having a creative passion can make or break the lives of kids and adults. Savannah needs this outlet.</li>
<li>Life can be stressful. We all need to laugh.</li>
<li>So far, in 2019 we've given out 41 Diversity &amp; Inclusion scholarships for improv classes. Our goal is to give out 80+ in 2020. </li>
<li>Supporting other groups in the South. In the past two years, FPI has raised thousands of dollars for Habitat for Humanity, Prevent Suicide Today, Savannah Stage Company, Creative Coast, and the soup kitchen, Emmaus House. With a space of our own, we look forward to investing in the people and causes of our community.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Guess what, this isn't easy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk 1. Not raising enough money for building out the space. What will we do? Whatever we don't raise we will cover by taking out a small business loan. Unfortunately, the idea of taking out a small business loan is, frankly, terrifying. We'll do it, because we believe so much in ourselves and what we do. But it will make opening and operating this theatre 10 times more stressful and difficult. So this is where you come in, and how you can save us from years of emotional turmoil. We do know we can cover the monthly bills — we have an excellent track record of booking out big audiences for our shows and covering our expenses — but having your donations to help us build out our dream theatre space without having to take out a loan will truly make all the difference in the first few years of opening and running this space.</li>
<li>Risk 2. What if no one comes to our shows? John and Brianne — two of our co-founders — have more than 25 years of producing, directing, and comedy experience. We will put on powerhouse shows. We already average 70 audience members at our Saturday night shows, and having a consistent space will help us build bigger and bigger audiences. We're entirely confident that if we build it, they will come.</li>
</ul>
