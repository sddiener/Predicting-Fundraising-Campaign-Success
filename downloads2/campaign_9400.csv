Our current gallery will still serve as our main hub for now, but this next chapter will involve several unique spaces around Chicago to exhibit larger, more extensive shows by local, emerging artists exploring the allegorical elephant in the room. These spaces include R. Hanel Gallery in the West Loop and Frazier Studios in the Fulton Market district. This would not be possible without our amazing colleagues and friends at these locations.</h4><h4>
<br/>We are excited to pursue these pop-up endeavors as it will allow us more freedom and exposure for our artists. We will show these exhibits in the same spirit as we have been; focusing on passionate emerging artists who are taking risks and weaving relevant messages into their work. Our current location at 704 S Wabash Avenue will continue to host exhibitions acting as another pop-up space.<br/>In addition to the pop-ups we are interested in seeing some of our conversations with artists and other organizations come to fruition in the form of public art projects and educational workshops. This constant dialogue of artistic expression will provide greater exposure for Elephant's artists and projects. </h4><h4>
<br/>The transition will enable us to provide further services in Art Consulting for artists, gallerists, collectors, and interns. Such services include intern and gallerist employment placement, artist career strategy and professional planning, and private and public collection development. Kimberly Leja Atwood's vast network and sincere dedication to the Chicagoland arts community are invaluable resources to anyone seeking career development in the field. <br/>As we approach our 5 year anniversary this November, we are excited about the gallery’s professional trajectory and the participating artists and curators in 2015. Some of the artists we’ll be working with next year include Sentrock, Andy Bellomo, Lewis Taylor, Will Fitzpatrick, Abraham, Cydney Lewis, Nicholas Barron and Jennifer Cronin.</h4><h4>
<br/>Where will your money go?

</h4><h4>We are excited for this opportunity to expand our contemporary art conversations to broader communities in Chicago.

<br/>Please help us reach these goals and expand our arts community with a financial investment. We sincerely appreciate your support of our mission and the artists we represent.</h4></div>","Elephant Room Inc. is thrilled to announce our expansion beyond the borders of the Wabash Arts Corridor in the South Loop. Our current gallery will still serve as our main hub for now, but this next chapter will involve several unique spaces around Chicago to exhibit larger, more extensive shows by local, emerging artists exploring the allegorical elephant in the room. These spaces include R. Hanel Gallery in the West Loop and Frazier Studios in the Fulton Market district. This would not be possible without our amazing colleagues and friends at these locations.
We are excited to pursue these pop-up endeavors as it will allow us more freedom and exposure for our artists. We will show these exhibits in the same spirit as we have been; focusing on passionate emerging artists who are taking risks and weaving relevant messages into their work. Our current location at 704 S Wabash Avenue will continue to host exhibitions acting as another pop-up space.In addition to the pop-ups we are interested in seeing some of our conversations with artists and other organizations come to fruition in the form of public art projects and educational workshops. This constant dialogue of artistic expression will provide greater exposure for Elephant's artists and projects. 
The transition will enable us to provide further services in Art Consulting for artists, gallerists, collectors, and interns. Such services include intern and gallerist employment placement, artist career strategy and professional planning, and private and public collection development. Kimberly Leja Atwood's vast network and sincere dedication to the Chicagoland arts community are invaluable resources to anyone seeking career development in the field. As we approach our 5 year anniversary this November, we are excited about the gallery’s professional trajectory and the participating artists and curators in 2015. Some of the artists we’ll be working with next year include Sentrock, Andy Bellomo, Lewis Taylor, Will Fitzpatrick, Abraham, Cydney Lewis, Nicholas Barron and Jennifer Cronin.
Where will your money go? Your funds will be used to host the pop-up exhibitions around the city, to develop our Intern Placement Program so that more artists and students interested may utilize the program’s opportunities, and to help us pursue public art endeavors including workshops and lectures for the community. 
We are excited for this opportunity to expand our contemporary art conversations to broader communities in Chicago. With this more diverse audience in mind, Elephant Room will continue to bring local emerging artists to the forefront so they can been seen, celebrated and supported. 
Please help us reach these goals and expand our arts community with a financial investment. We sincerely appreciate your support of our mission and the artists we represent.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Vancouver-based Sheree Plett (singer songwriter) and Shari-Anne Vis (visual artist) who are old friends and have decided to go on an adventure and make a children's book! Inspired by recently becoming mothers ourselves, this creative project is meaningful and personal.  Sheree created an album of original lullabies for her son, Henry, and then asked Shari-Anne if she would illustrate one of her songs, Times Two. </p>
<p><span>This old-fashioned, hardbound book features hand-made, watercolor paintings: raccoons fly to the moon and back, wear sweaters and swim goggles, float on the sea while watching clouds; their adventures all express how limitless our love is for our little ones. This book is especially for infants and toddlers, but could really be for any dearly loved people in our lives. </span></p>
<p><span>Here is a glimpse into our little book:</span></p>
<p>""I love you right up to the moon, then back again, times two. As wide as I can stretch my arms, as tall as I can reach, I love you, I love you, times two.""</p>
<p>This book will include a free download of the song, Times Two!</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign, you would enable us to print many copies so that we can share this book not only with our community but yours as well! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $4800 to print 1000 hardbound books with 24 text pages.  We are excited to be getting them printed locally, in Canada, and would be so grateful for your contributions!</p>
<p>We have amazing perks that we will offer you to honour your generosity! These can include your very own copy of the book, Times Two, personally inscribed, as well as a song written personally by Sheree Plett.  Please see below for more details!</p>
<p>Even if we do not reach our goal, the funds we do receive will all go towards the cost of printing which will be so helpful!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are excited to sell our book in independent bookstores and through community events, but we are also excited to donate our book to those in our community who may have less access to beautiful children's literature.</p>

<p><strong>THE STORY</strong></p>
<p>The Bronx River Art Center put out an open call for submissions for an exhibit called ""Virtual/Monumental"", a group of works to be experienced throughout the West Farms neighborhood using iPhones, iPads, and other mobile devices.  <strong>Maria and Nate - classmates from NYU, great friends, and oft-collaborators - talked it through: ""We should submit a project!""</strong></p>
<p>We did some research about the neighborhood and found out about the Old West Farms Soldiers' Cemetery, an almost 200-year-old cemetery nestled in between project houses and a church, that is the home to 40 local soldiers who fought in the War of 1812, Spanish-American War, Civil War, and World War I.  We were mesmerized by the intimate nature of the cemetery and the stories of the men buried there.  <strong>We thought a lot about the ritual, location, and meanings of burial, and how these pieces play into the sacrifices men and women of the Bronx, New York, and USA have been making as soldiers from the Revoltionary War through today, in Afghanistan.</strong></p>
<p>We applied, crossed our fingers, and waited: soon enough, <strong>we were thrilled to learn we had been selected! </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p>Our piece, <em>A Play to Lay My Head</em>, seeks to pay homage to the long line of sacrifices made by soldiers from the Bronx by setting each viewer onto an intimate journey throughout the cemetery.</p>
<p><strong>The Bronx River Art Center is a modest organization</strong>, and one of the few arts organizations in the Bronx biting off way more than it can chew.  <strong>Therefore, we are looking to raise a small amount of funds to off-set the costs of the project</strong> that exceed the stipend we have been awarded.</p>
<p>We've been thrilled to work with three amazing collaborators on the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>LOU GRUBER, </strong>our Cinematographer and Editor</li>
<li>
<strong>BRIAN HASTERT </strong>and <strong>WILL SEEFRIED</strong>, our Performers</li>
</ul><p>All funds raised will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying Lou, Brian, and Will for their incredible work</li>
<li>Paying for the military costumes</li>
<li>Paying for props and other small equipment</li>
<li>Transportation (gas and tolls) to and from the cemetery while we made the piece</li>
</ul><p><strong>THE EVENT</strong></p>
<p>Finally, we very much hope you can join us on Saturday, August 11th for the opening reception of ""Virtual/Monumental"" and to experience <em>A Play to Lay My Head</em> for yourself.  We are incredibly proud of the piece and want to share it with as many of our friends as possible.</p>

<p>My name is Kayla Knadle. I am a self-employed artist. I work
from home, and while commissions may be slow, it is the passion in my life. I
am an artist of many different skills ranging from drawing, oil painting,
watercolors, airbrushing, and even painting dolls as well as sculpting. I pride
myself in my ability to paint quickly without losing quality of my work. I
recently had an art exhibition at Wake the Dead Coffee House in San Marcos, TX,
and I am currently looking to do more shows. I truly enjoy my work and I cannot
imagine myself doing anything else with my life!</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Long Story Short:</b></h3>
<p>I would love to exchange my artwork for expensive dental
bills to improve the quality of my life and continue making art.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>Why do I need help?</h3>
<p>When I went away to college, I had to get my braces taken
off early as I could no longer afford them- they were nowhere near ready to be
taken off, either. After recently graduating and moving to a new state, I lost
my health insurance as I cannot be covered by my parents anymore. I am hoping
to get insurance in this upcoming enrollment year through my fiancé, but right
now I am stuck between a rock and a hard place as I need work done ASAP.</p>
<p>After my braces were taken off early, I was affixed with a
permanent retainer that needed to be removed <i>3 years ago. </i>In that time, the retainer has shifted my teeth as
well as deteriorated my bone in my jaw. On top of that, bad genetics have left
me with cavities and nearing the edge of needing a root canal. I do need at
least one crown to be put on my tooth as soon as possible before the pain gets
even worse. At this point, braces may even become medically necessary because
of the deterioration. </p>
<p>I was given the pricing estimate of all the work that needs
to be done, not including braces, of $4,000. I have done everything in my power
to call every dentist, financing, carecredit, medical assistance program, etc
and nothing could be done to reduce this bill. Even if I had Medicaid, the
dentist wouldn’t accept it. My only option right now is to do one procedure at
a time, out of pocket, and hope it isn’t too late before I can get everything
fixed.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3>What will you get?</h3>
<p>I am willing and eager to provide artwork for your support. I
am very capable of working quickly and I can draw, paint, or create anything
you would like, just drop me a note/email specifying what you are looking for
and I can do my best. Sketches below contributions of $50 will be single
character (or animal) with no or little background. Artwork for contributions
above $50 may be talked about privately! Please, let me know if you are located
out of the United States. I will need to speak to you about shipping costs.</p><p><br/></p>

<h3>When will you receive your artwork?</h3>
<p>I have work that is already completed and ready to be
shipped, if you would like a piece please let me know and I can mail it out as
soon as possible. If you see an existing piece that you really like but is sold
let me know and I may be able to create something similar!</p>
<p>I will do my best to make sure that all work is completed
within the order of the contributions. As I do artwork for a living, I will
have to balance already existing commissions with indiegogo commissions.
Because I will need dental work done, there may be a period of resting time
between procedures as I’m sure I will be in a lot of pain. I promise you this:
you will receive your artwork in under 6 months of the campaign ending. Small pieces
under the $100 contribution mark will be completed  within a month after the campaign ends.  Larger, more intricate works will be discussed with you as they require more
time. I hope to speak with you individually on any dates that are important to
have your work done by (birthday, anniversaries, etc), so please do let me
know. I ask for your patience and trust.</p><p><br/></p><h2>Please view my image gallery for example of perks and available paintings!</h2><p><br/></p>

under the $100 contribution mark will be completed  within a month after the campaign ends.  Larger, more intricate works will be discussed with you as they require more
time. I hope to speak with you individually on any dates that are important to
have your work done by (birthday, anniversaries, etc), so please do let me
know. I ask for your patience and trust.Please view my image gallery for example of perks and available paintings!

<h3>The True You Project</h3>
<p>The True You Project is dedicated to seeing people at their best and giving them a chance to see it for themselves. I'll be having life coaching conversations with 100 people so that they can (re)discover their true selves and taste what their life could be if they were to continue living from that place.  The essence that we discover in each call will become the inspiration for a work of art, resulting in 100 pieces.</p>
<p>It was through a year-long life coach training program that I rediscovered I wanted to be an artist.  Through coaching, I was able to reconnect with the essence of who I am, which provided me with the clarity and strength to see my fears and doubts as thoughts that simply weren't true. This fearlessness to pursue my dreams is what inspired this project and it's what I'm hoping to share with each individual who takes part in it. </p>
<p>Through an hour and a half coaching conversation, people can see and own what makes them unique. For the people I've worked with so far, this has been a springboard into creating the life they dream about rather than they one they think they should be living.</p>
<p>Since words can only go so far in conveying the essence of a human being, I've decided to capture it through art.  The culmination of The True You project will be an Art Show in a gallery in Chelsea displaying all 100 works of those 100 individuals.  The Show is intended to be a celebration the amazing capacity human beings have for love.  And you're all invited!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is a passion project of mine to take action toward creating the world I envision—a world of love and collaboration rather than fear and competition.  It’s an ultimate work of collaboration because I can’t make this project a reality without some outside support. Your donations will go to:</p>
<p>·       Renting the venue for the final show/experience</p>
<p>·       Supplies for creating the art</p>
<p>·       Food and drinks that will be provided at the show</p>
<p>·      Hiring assistance in putting the show together</p>
<p>·       Production and marketing costs</p>
<p>What you get in return for your donation</p>
<p>·       $10 – personalized thank you note featuring a work from the show</p>
<p>·       $25 – thank you note and a free ticket to the event</p>
<p>·       $100 – thank you note, free ticket, and a free life coaching call as part of the project</p>
<p>·       $250 – all of the above, plus you get to take home your personalized artwork</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What I’m offering people is an opportunity for love, connection, and transformation.  It’s not every day that a person has the opportunity to talk about their life with an outside, unbiased, nonjudgmental party, and the gift of listening and reflecting without judgment is priceless. </p>
<p>The outcome of each conversation is a work of art, but it’s really a reflection of an experience and the possibility of the life you've been dreaming about but may not have thought possible. </p>
</div><ul></ul><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share on social media.</li>
<li>Share with friends and family.</li>
<li>Maybe's there a community bulletin board you post this on.</li>
<li>You may know someone looking for a personalized piece of art, who would be interested in being part of this project.</li>

<h2>My Story</h2>
<p></p>
<p>I am
an art therapist
in Nelson, British Columbia and have recently been invited to present at the 2016 International Art Therapy Conference in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>This invitation comes as a great honour and works
towards both the advocacy of the field of art therapy and the development of global
community. At the conference I will present my thesis, where I facilitated an
art therapy group with
International High School students from various world
regions including China, South Korea, Germany, France and Mexico. Findings revealed many benefits in
supporting international students who face the challenges of living and
studying in a host country. Through creative expression and social connection,
the art group allowed international students a safe and supportive environment
to explore and express aspects of personal and cultural identity, learn interpersonal
skills, improve linguistic and cultural fluency, and enjoy the connection and
creativity of the art group experience. Together, we
recognized that art
serves not only as a means of self-expression but as a language that has the
power to transcend cultural and linguistic barriers.</p>
<p>This
project will also take me to Taiwan, where I previously lived
as an artist and educator. In Taiwan I learned Mandarin Chinese,  immersed myself in Taiwanese culture, and over the years cultivated a rich community of local and international friends. As a Mandarin speaker, the ability to serve the
community in promoting mental health and wellness through the modality of art therapy for self-expression, personal growth, and healing is an
amazingly personal and cross-cultural connection. </p>
<p>Both my time as an ESL educator and as an art
therapist has shown me the significance of helping to build the self-esteem and
self-empowerment of those I interact with. It is in this spirit that,
while in
Taiwan I will offer a series of free art therapy workshops and hold several
exhibitions to share my own therapeutic art journey with my community there. </p>
<p>While in Hong Kong I will also have the opportunity to
further my training
in Trauma-Informed
Art Therapy through a 3-day certification program facilitated by
an American art therapy pioneer. This training will equip me for future work
with individuals and groups who have experienced trauma. This work has never
been more important than at this time where many countries including Canada are
welcoming refugees and immigrants from war-torn regions who require support in
adapting to their new homes and in healing traumas incurred through their
transitions.</p>
<p>Global
community is really important to me. I am so grateful for
the opportunity
to share my passion and experiences through this project, and in doing so,
continue to cultivate community, and expand my concept of ‘Home’.</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Individual:</b> To me, Art Therapy is about empowerment and healing at the personal level. At any age or stage in one's life, Art Therapy can be a used to tell one's story, and as a tool for self-expression, personal growth and insight. As an Art Therapist, I am passionate about advocating for the field of Art Therapy. This means that in addition to offering Art Therapy services to individuals and groups, I also embrace opportunities to present at conferences, offer workshops, and continue my professional development. </p>
<p><b>Community: </b>This project is about cultivating community on the local, international and global levels. Through participating in international Art Therapy training and conferences, and providing hand-on art therapy experience for individuals in Taiwan, international community is cultivated, and the benefits of the therapeutic arts process are shared more widely. </p>
<p><b>Global: </b>Our videographer will video document the project and create a documentary about the experience which will be shared locally and globally. We hope that the knowledge and experience gained from this project will benefit all those involved.</p>

</div>
<div><p><b>The 2016

<div>
<p>The Conference will feature keynote speakers as well as more than 20 other cutting-edge art therapy pioneers from 15 countries, delivering workshops and papers on the use of art therapy in different cultures and contexts. In view of the urgent need for assistance by children and adolescents with special educational needs and people who have experienced trauma, the theme of the Conference will focus on these populations of people in need.</p>
<p>The 2016 International Conference on Art Therapy is organized by a group of passionate and professional art therapists, clinical psychologists and social workers.

<br/><h3>What is Art Therapy?</h3>
<div>Art Therapy is a form of Expressive Arts Therapy that uses the creative process of making art within a therapeutic relationship, to improve a person's physical, emotional, and mental well-being. As Art Therapists we believe that the creative process is inherently healing and life-enhancing. </div>
<div>For more information, see this article by Cathy Malchiodi: <a href=""http://www.cathymalchiodi.com/about/what-is-art-therapy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"">What is Art Therapy?</a>
</div>
<h3>""But I'm not an Artist!""</h3>
<div>A common misconception that I often hear in my work is that one needs to be an artist to enjoy the benefits of Art Therapy. The intention of using art as a tool for self-expression is that through the use of color, line, metaphor and imagery, we can by-pass the conscious mind and express ourselves in ways that are sometimes not possible through verbal language.</div>

with individuals and groups who have experienced trauma. This work has never
been more important than at this time where many countries including Canada are
welcoming refugees and immigrants from war-torn regions who require support in
adapting to their new homes and in healing traumas incurred through their
transitions.
Global
community is really important to me. I am so grateful for
the opportunity
to share my passion and experiences through this project, and in doing so,
continue to cultivate community, and expand my concept of ‘Home’.


   Give and Receive
 



As a professional Art Therapist and a member of an international community in Taiwan and Hong Kong, I have accepted an important opportunity to:



Present my Art Therapy research thesis (about the benefits of a therapeutic art group with international high school students) at the 2016 International Art Therapy Conference in Hong Kong.
Complete Level 3 Trauma-Informed Art Therapy Certification in Hong Kong (with art therapy pioneer Dr. Cathy Malchiodi).

Your contribution will support me and my partner to complete this project. In Hong Kong I will complete the training, present my thesis at the conference, and cultivate connections with an international community of cutting edge Art Therapy pioneers. 
As the director of Avatar Computer and Technology, my partner/videogrpher will be a valued member of the Conference Volunteer Team to provide his technological expertise and support.
In addition we will spend time in Taiwan where I will be offering a series of free Art Therapy workshops to give individuals from both the local and international community an opportunity to experience first-hand the benefits of Art Therapy. My partner/videographer will video and photo document the project, and create a documentary which will be shared with contributors, participants, family and friends, and our local and international community.


Your contributions will cover our Basic Costs: 



$703 for Trauma-Informed Art Therapy Certification Level 3 with the renowned Dr. Cathy Malchiodi (in Hong Kong, May 21-23) ($703)


$500 each for Conference fees for presenting/participating at the 2016 International Conference on Art Therapy (in Hong Kong, May 27-29) ($500 x 2 = $1000)

$1100 each for round-trip flights from Nelson, B.
     C., to Taiwan ($1100 x 2 = $2200)
$270 each for round-trip flights from Taiwan to
     Hong Kong ($270 x 2 = $540)

In addition, your contributions will fund a series of Art Therapy Workshops in Taiwan for the local and international community:


3 workshops accommodating 14 participants each at $25/participant (42 participants x $25 = $1050)
Art materials for the workshops at $6/person (42 participants x $6 = $252)

Workshop total cost: $1302
Total
     expenses: $5745 CAD




If we do not reach our entire campaign goal, we
     will use your contributions to fund the Trauma-Informed Art Therapy Training, and Conference fees. We want to prioritize education and advocacy of the field
     of Art Therapy.
In the event that we raise more than our campaign
     goal, surplus funds will be utilized to provide professional Art Therapy services to individuals and groups who have experienced trauma, or who are working to integrate themselves inter-culturally, such as with international students, immigrants and refugees.

The Perks for Contributors:

In gratitude for your contributions, we are offering a variety of perks, from original art postcards mailed from Taiwan or Hong Kong, handmade art cards and art prints, a Mandala Coloring Book, Computer Consultation Sessions with Avatar Computer and Technology, Mandarin Chinese Lessons, Art Therapy Workshops, and Original Paintings. All art is original by Laura Andrew. Please see the 'Perks' section for specifics.








As a way of giving back to the local and international community in Taiwan, I will do the following:

Share my Art Therapy training and experience by offering a series of Free Art Therapy workshops in Taiwan.
Create a documentary about this international art therapy project to raise awareness of the benefits of art therapy in promoting mental health and well-being.
Hold two Art Shows at the Lei Gallery and Chameleon Workshop to share my therapeutic art journey which unfolded throughout my two years training as an art therapist.

To see these non-profit Art Collectives in Taiwan, please follow the links below:

Lei Gallery Facebook Page


Additionally, upon returning home to Nelson, BC, we will share our experience and documentary through a social action event at the Kuentai Art Therapy Institute. Details to follow.



The Impact

 
The impacts of this project will be felt on three levels: Individual, Community and Global.




Individual: To me, Art Therapy is about empowerment and healing at the personal level. At any age or stage in one's life, Art Therapy can be a used to tell one's story, and as a tool for self-expression, personal growth and insight. As an Art Therapist, I am passionate about advocating for the field of Art Therapy. This means that in addition to offering Art Therapy services to individuals and groups, I also embrace opportunities to present at conferences, offer workshops, and continue my professional development. 
Community: This project is about cultivating community on the local, international and global levels. Through participating in international Art Therapy training and conferences, and providing hand-on art therapy experience for individuals in Taiwan, international community is cultivated, and the benefits of the therapeutic arts process are shared more widely. 
Global: Our videographer will video document the project and create a documentary about the experience which will be shared locally and globally. We hope that the knowledge and experience gained from this project will benefit all those involved.




The 2016
International Conference on Art Therapy in Hong Kong:

The Conference will feature keynote speakers as well as more than 20 other cutting-edge art therapy pioneers from 15 countries, delivering workshops and papers on the use of art therapy in different cultures and contexts. In view of the urgent need for assistance by children and adolescents with special educational needs and people who have experienced trauma, the theme of the Conference will focus on these populations of people in need.
The 2016 International Conference on Art Therapy is organized by a group of passionate and professional art therapists, clinical psychologists and social workers. All surplus of this Conference will be donated to Psycho-Art Therapy Association, a team of volunteers using art therapy to help people in need in China, Hong Kong, Nepal, Cambodia and Myanmar.

What is Art Therapy?
Art Therapy is a form of Expressive Arts Therapy that uses the creative process of making art within a therapeutic relationship, to improve a person's physical, emotional, and mental well-being. As Art Therapists we believe that the creative process is inherently healing and life-enhancing. 
For more information, see this article by Cathy Malchiodi: What is Art Therapy?

""But I'm not an Artist!""
A common misconception that I often hear in my work is that one needs to be an artist to enjoy the benefits of Art Therapy. The intention of using art as a tool for self-expression is that through the use of color, line, metaphor and imagery, we can by-pass the conscious mind and express ourselves in ways that are sometimes not possible through verbal language.

<p>Ours is a time marked by great innovation and prosperity— alongside salient injustices. Economic inequality exists.

THE INSPIRATION

What do Uncommon Spaces look like? They are everyday public spaces that have been transformed into multi-faceted cultural centers through a combination of community outreach, public programs, and community-driven art. These spaces celebrate the beauty of place and the untold stories of what are often overlooked and misrepresented communities. 
I am particularly inspired by:Life is Living Festival in Oakland, which brings alive the the Black Panther legacy of community resilience and service through an art and music festival that sparks dialogue around community health and environmental issues. All this happens in deFremery Park, the very location where the revolutionary group held forth 50 years ago. The park becomes a living testament to the soulful Oakland identity that has overcome adversity by staying true to its legacy  while continuing to invent itself.Image via: youthspeaks.org

A 10-day railroad journey across America with stops in cities like Pittsburgh, Chicago, Kansas City, Albuquerque, and Los Angeles, Millennial Trains Project is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to travel cross-country by railroad, and connect deeply with what urban communities are making possible. Along the way, I’ll gain access to world class mentors, leadership development, design thinking skills, and an incredible opportunity to grow as a leader and innovator— I will come away from the experience poised to lead positive change in my San Francisco Bay Area community. 
I am using the MTP journey as a platform to investigate and gain an understanding of each city through the lens of  art, place, and community: 


What are the changes, challenges, and conditions that communities are facing? 
How are artists and leaders addressing those challenges in creative ways? 
What are the practices, processes, and theories of change faced by creative placemakers and visionary artists as they endeavor to build strong, diverse, empowered communities through their creative activations? 
How are the stories, dreams, triumphs, and challenges of these communities expressed through these projects? 

What can I share from my observations and experiences in the SF Bay Area that can support communities across the country?


Demographics in America are shifting, and I am placing particular focus on communities of color that have often been disenfranchised from resources, investment, and processes of urban planning and arts funding— yet it is these very communities that will drive growth and change.
These are communities on the verge— and through the MTP journey, I’ll get to curate content for Uncommon Spaces while investigating community-driven creative placemaking on one of the two Millennial Train Journeys happening this summer.
But I need your support! While my project has been shortlisted by the MTP Selection Committee, it's up to my community to get me all the way through. I need to be among the first 30 applicants to crowd fund the $5000 program fee to secure my spot on the train, and your support will help me achieve that. 
Your contribution is a tax-deductible donation to Millennial Trains Project, a 501(c)3 non-profit and it gets me on board one of these two journeys that are being offered through the Millennial Trains Project. I've researched and identified the following organizations in each city from which I will curate content for the Uncommon Spaces website. Let me know if there are other great organizations in these cities that I can connect with!
""CHANGE""  // August 1-7

PITTSBURGH: City of Asylum and Pittsburgh Cultural Trust
CHICAGO: Arts in Public Life Initiative
KANSAS CITY: Arts Council of Johnson County
ALBUQUERQUE: Stories of Route 66: The International District
LOS ANGELES: Manifest:Justice
""UNITY"" // August 10-17
LOS ANGELES: Manifest:Justice
SAN FRANCISCO: Quesada Gardens Initiative and Mission Community Market
DENVER: RedLine Art Space and Birdseed Collective
MILWAUKEE: The ARTery
DETROIT: Porous Borders Festival
A note on funding:


If this campaign is among the first 30 to reach its $5K goal, all funds raised will go to Millennial Trains Project, which is a 501(c)3 organization. Any donation you make will be tax-deductible. 

Your donation will help to underwrite the costs of the journey and its associated programming, transportation, and hospitality fees. 
If I am not not among the first 30 applicants to reach my crowdfunding goal, you will not be charged for your donation.
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Now, I know not all of us are rollin in it and in a position to make a monetary contribution. And there are other ways you can support me that would be just as meaningful!

<h3>About 'Grief' - A Performance art</h3>
<p>Hey all! As most of you know, along with my photography, I also try to explore my creativity by doing performance art shows. I've had the opportunity to perform two pieces in Japan and received positive feedback from people. Most people who attended the show said they had never seen a performance art show before and that it was an unexpectedly beautiful experience. </p>
<p>I have another project that I'd like to share with you all this fall, a show to portray my art and to ignite that artistic spark in people who are able to attend. A show that will make you forget about your past, present and future, a show that will connect you to your own primitive self.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>What I Need </h2>
<p>Right now, I'm still working on the details, and I wouldn't want to say too much without being certain of my creative direction. I'm really looking forward to sharing what I've got planned, and I'll be releasing more information closer to the performance date BUT I'm so excited to perform this show here in Japan this October. </p>
<p>The exact date and location of the show will be released later on, but right now I want you to hear me out. </p>
<p>The tickets to the show will cost ¥2500 and will cover the cost of the venue, equipment, props and make-up. If I can make it to ¥200,000 the show will be funded and you can all come and see the performance or stream it online!</p>
<p>So right now, I need your help with covering the costs of the show. And also, if, with your help, we can raise just a little bit extra....you'll be helping me on my way to achieve something even bigger, something even more important. My big move to study art history and curating to London! I'm extremely excited about this move and funding from this show will help to make this dream into a reality.</p>
<h2>What you get</h2>
<p>Ticket prices are ¥2500</p>
<p>My art shows are an interactive experience - the audience does not simply sit and watch the performance unfold in front of them, the audience engage and participate. The audience becomes the artist. So you get to experience what it's like to be an artist for a few hours. But since things are still a little bit difficult these days due the COVID-19 pandemic, I will also stream the show online. So wherever you may be, you can still experience this performance.</p>
<p>Along with that, I'd also like to offer a little bit more to friends out there who are willing to donate a little bit more. And here what they are;</p>
<h3>For donations over     </h3>
<p>¥5000 you can get a signed copy of one of my photos.</p>
<p> ¥10,000 a 2 hour shoot with me as your photographer, for a photoshoot of the concept of your liking.</p>
<p> ¥15,000 an all day photoshoot around Nagoya city with me as either your photographer or a model (for other photographers) and 3 printed copies of your favorite shots.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p>Please like and share this page! Even if you can't contribute funds, you can follow me on Instagram and support my art. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>

And also, if, with your help, we can raise just a little bit extra....you'll be helping me on my way to achieve something even bigger, something even more important. My big move to study art history and curating to London! I'm extremely excited about this move and funding from this show will help to make this dream into a reality.
What you get
Ticket prices are ¥2500
My art shows are an interactive experience - the audience does not simply sit and watch the performance unfold in front of them, the audience engage and participate. The audience becomes the artist. So you get to experience what it's like to be an artist for a few hours. But since things are still a little bit difficult these days due the COVID-19 pandemic, I will also stream the show online. So wherever you may be, you can still experience this performance.
Along with that, I'd also like to offer a little bit more to friends out there who are willing to donate a little bit more. And here what they are;
For donations over     
¥5000 you can get a signed copy of one of my photos.
 ¥10,000 a 2 hour shoot with me as your photographer, for a photoshoot of the concept of your liking.
 ¥15,000 an all day photoshoot around Nagoya city with me as either your photographer or a model (for other photographers) and 3 printed copies of your favorite shots.
Other Ways You Can Help:
Please like and share this page! Even if you can't contribute funds, you can follow me on Instagram and support my art.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Some reflections from Spotlight youth participating in <i>You Belong Here</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>TRAYVON </b>-- To actually sit there and hear the feedback on what we should integrate and what we would need to make the film was absolutely amazing, but different for me. I felt like I was actually in charge of something and that our movie actually matters. It was good to see everyone wanting to get engaged into the movie and think of it as their own. Also, I liked how they could visualize the movie in their heads and their bodies. I was pretty sure that everything would go smoothly. The whole experience was great. <b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>IZZA </b>-- The experience today for me was better than I expected. 1.) Everyone got together really well and respected each other's opinions. 2.) Everyone's points of view were so different but so on point. It really expanded my bubble of what this project/movie can/will be. I also thought that everyone's points of view were expressed in a good way without people clashing/disturbing. The ideas people gave were so wonderful, and a necessary point of view for us to have. My view/thoughts for this movie has really expanded and more and more ideas are flowing in. </p>
<p><b>MOSIAH </b>-- Receiving feedback on my movie was good. I heard a lot of good things from experienced people who know what they are doing. Whenever someone gave their feedback it seemed like they weren't criticizing it; they were trying to help make it better. I took what they said to heart and made a change to the movie. I really think it is going to turn out great. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
World renowned visionary artist, Adam Scott Miller, and aspiring author, Bridey Walker, are pleased to present our story ""Across the Rainbow Bridge"", a colourful tale of a little angel who dreams of meeting his Earth parents, and journeys through the seven colours of the Rainbow Bridge to wake up on Earth as a human baby.</div>

<div>With a complete manuscript and a publishing plan, we need to get the artwork completed in order to submit our work for publishing.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
For our publishing dream to be realised, we need to raise $7000. We have chosen to submit to Pickawoowoo Publishers, a publisher of spiritual books based in Western Australia. Although they are closed for submissions, they offer a trade publishing option for accepted authors who are willing to buy back a certain amount of books. This is called the ""authors wish list"" and details of this can be found at: <a href=""http://www.pickawoowoo.com/assets/Publishing/Authors-Wish-Agreement.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.pickawoowoo.com/assets/Publishing/Authors-Wish-Agreement.pdf</a>.</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
""Across the Rainbow Bridge"" is my attempt to explain how we all come to be here on planet Earth, and while it is marketed as a children's book, I believe it is the adults who will benefit the most from reading this story. It would appeal to anyone who has children or who dreams of having children, or anyone who is human. When published, ""Across The Rainbow Bridge"" will be a perfect marriage of text and imagery, and would make an ideal bedtime story.</div>

Across the Rainbow Bridge

High in the sky, where the angels fly,On a little, puffy white cloud,An angel lay sleeping, his eyes tightly closed,Snoring — but not very loud.
 
He dreamed of a man and a woman in love,Who were living together on Earth.They wanted the angel to come to them;And bless them with his birth.
 
When he awoke, his mind was filledWith constant thoughts of this pair.He wanted to go and meet them on Earth;He wanted to live with them there.
 
To the big angels this little one went,And shared with them his plan.“Please let me journey down to the Earth,To meet this woman and man.”“Of course you may go,” the big angels said,“But the journey is long, you should know.Close by is a bridge of beautiful colours,And across it you must go.”
 
The little angel gave up his wings,And to all of his friends bade goodbye.He set off towards the Rainbow Bridge,Connecting the Earth to the sky.
 
Ahead of him, the Rainbow BridgeGlimmered as bright as the sun.Through seven colours would he pass;His journey to Earth had begun.
 
He stepped forward slowly, and violet he saw.Voices from above he could hear.Words of love and good wishes they gave,Whispering into his ear.
 
Next came indigo, an owl in a tree,A thunder high in the sky.Memories were fading in the angel’s mind,Memories beginning to die.Indigo faded into blue,The beat of a drum somewhere near.Earthly music sang from below;The path ahead was now clear.
 
Continuing through to the colour green,A sensation of balance he felt;Neither good nor bad, scared nor brave.The colour began to melt.
 
Around him swirled yellow, angry like fireAnd as bright as the sun at midday.Feelings of power welled up inside,
And yellow, too, faded away.
 
Next was orange, a colour so clear.No longer an angel was this boy now;A physical form was appearing,Far, far away from his cloud.
 
Red was the colour that surrounded him now,Tucked in a space small and warm.Sleep, little baby, inside your womb.From there you’ll soon be born.All went black and the boy fell asleep.By now three seasons had passed.When he awoke, the world was so bright;On Earth he was at last.
 
Slowly he focused his eyes and he blinked.Smiling faces he saw through the blur,Of the man and woman from his dream;His mother and father they were.
 
Forgotten now was the Rainbow Bridge,And the puffy, white cloud way up high.A proud woman and man gazed down at their boy;They would love him the rest of their lives.

The dynamic environment facilitates growth, idea development, & collaboration; while pushing comfort zones & maximizing strengths to build passionate & profitable lives.

What is it exactly?
Community & support are critical elements of any equation. We offer story-features on artists, articles, business tools, thousands of resources, and our undying committment to do whatever we can to help our members dream big dreams and make them happen. This makes our community invaluable.

Your business to-do list will always be there, your monthly reports will update automatically, your trusty business peeps (that's us) are always here for you!
Imagine if YOU could do the one thing you thought you could never do. What if you were given everything you needed?

<p>As a college student, I have always struggled to get funding for school.The university has been unable to offer me any scholarships or other types of<br/>financial aid, so I have tried loans, grants, and government funding. But at<br/>the end of each semester I find I am always left with a negative balance.<br/>I have been able to put myself through 2 years of school so far and have<br/>been able to get by with hard work and the generosity of<br/>my family and friends.</p>
<p>I have managed to keep a job and take care of my studies so far, but the lack of funds makes it very difficult. I was unable to attend this past fall semester due to not having enough money to pay all of the different fees. It left me short on houseing and books. I have also not been able to register for the spring semester and am terribly upset with the setback. I want to continue my education and graduate. The loans and grants are available but not enough. I have spend last semester and will spend this semester working full time and saving as much as possible to put to next years tuition.</p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/>I have calculated that with my pay for the next few months and the amount I have already put back for tuition I will be $1450 short for the semester.

<h3>Who Am I?<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476116889/hp1qjdwhsmb8tf9g4k6q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Lyz Luidens (<a href=""http://www.lyzluidens.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.lyzluidens.com</a>), printmaker, teacher, and map enthusiast! I work in my print studio, the Prankster Press (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pranksterpressprinters"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.facebook.com/pranksterpressprinters</a>), housed in the Riopelle Artist Collective (<a href=""http://www.riopelle.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.riopelle.co</a>), which contains relief and etching presses, letterpresses, and space for screenprinting. I also teach art part time in schools and art centers. I am completely in love with printmaking, in all of it's various methods and techniques. Teaching other people how to make prints is the best way I know to share this meditative, inky dance between technical process and conceptual process that brings me so much joy.</p>
<h3><strong>What is the Detroit Atlas Collaboration?<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476117918/ypmguocwmwsxxbjq6pkt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h3>
<p>This collaborative community project combines mapmaking, bookbinding, data and historical map research, and printmaking through free art workshops! As a completed project, the Detroit Atlas will have been a collaboration between Detroiters in a wide range of neighborhoods to map Detroit as they have experienced it, within the bounds of the same art project, all while learning and experiencing the technical, tactile, and interactive process of printmaking. These maps will provide context for one another, a juxtaposition of personal experiences of people who live in the same geographic space, but often very different social, political, and historically contextualized spaces. You can read more in detail at <a href=""http://www.detroitatlas.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.detroitatlas.com</a> !</p>
<h3><strong>Why Printmaking?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476122526/k39nwbo3wnr6hclmgkiw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The processes of printmaking (of which there are many!) are already very meditative, and I personally use them as a mindfulness exercise to calm my thoughts and anxieties, focusing on the work my hands are doing with all of the tools involved. It makes perfect sense to me to combine the theme of mapmaking, of remembering how you have experienced particular physical spaces, with this already meditative practice. I believe that making art can be a truly transformative experience, especially when done collaboratively.</p>
<p>There’s also something especially beautiful about a hands on process that is meant to create multiples of a piece of art, meant to be seen and owned and accessed by a wide range of people. It makes for a good collaborative medium, because people can make many copies of their relief block or screen to keep and to share. The multiplicity of printmaking is a welcome contradiction to the inaccessible elitism often imposed on fine art making. I take pride in my craft as a printmaker, but I take more pride in sharing it. </p>
<h3><strong>What is the Goal?</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476122580/spg3lmxd32jdynmiboo3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The main goals of this project are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide free printmaking and mapmaking workshops in many neighborhoods in Detroit based on the idea of mapmaking</li>
<li> To allow the project to serve as a conversation starter about lived experience in Detroit as compared to the data based and historical depictions of the city, and to serve as a visual documentation of those interactions</li>
<li>To connect the themes and ideas that local community organizations, schools, teachers, and artists are passionate about to residents of the city through an accessible form of artmaking; mapping and printmaking are flexible activities, and can change as the conversation with collaborators changes</li>
</ul>
<p>The true value of this project comes from the variety of perspectives provided by workshop attendees, hosts, researchers and collaborators, all of whom will be credited as collaborators on the project website and any exhibitions of the final work. This is a printmaking project that is also an analog data collection project. It’s a mapping project that is also a mindfulness project. But most importantly, it’s a collaboration.  </p>
<p>In the end, I hope to have a set of Atlases of Detroit, printed by Detroiters, which will be housed in a public space like a library or community center, where this information about the city will always be accessible to anyone interested in it. The maps will also be digitally available on the project website, as well as all of the prompts and lesson plans for the workshops, so that it can be recreated anywhere, by anyone!</p>

<p>The Detroit Atlas Collaboration began when I received a Knight Arts Challenge Grant of $10,000 and the 2015 Fall Michele Schara Artist Residency. The Residency jumpstarted this project in a high school art class at Detroit Community High School. To fully execute this project, I need to raise a matching $10,000 to receive the Knight Arts Grant, and the supply budget of $3000 for the residency combined with a year of fundraising efforts through events, sales, and other campaigns brings that down to $3,150 left to raise, which is what brings us here!</p>
<p>Your donations will help to pay for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Printmaking supplies and materials for the workshops</strong> like paper, ink, brayers, lesson plan materials, wood and linoleum blocks for carving, screens for screen printing, and more! One of the best parts of this project is being able to reach out to schools and community organizations and tell them that I have a fully funded printmaking curriculum that just needs participants. </li>
<li>
<strong>Pay for Artists and Teachers!</strong> As soon as I have access to the Knight Foundation grant, I will be able to seek out local artists and teachers to help run some of these workshops and/or complete some prints for the project. Your donations help me to pay these dedicated folks for their time and effort!</li>
<li>
<b>Research and Creation</b> of screens and relief blocks depicting data based and historically maps of Detroit. Lasercutting relief blocks and burning screens for screenprinting requires access to tools that we will need to pay some fees to use.  </li>
<li>You'll receive a variety of handmade rewards for your contributions - check out the perks section to see what kind of printed goodies you can expect in the mail as a thank you for your contribution!</li>

</div> </div>","About the ArtistChristine Jimenez, was born and raised in Quezon City, Philippines and resides in London, England. Christine has been a fan of Lea Salonga since the age of 6 and with Miss Saigon opening the doors to many Filipino actors including her idol, it also opened her to the world of theatre.  She grew up listening to the songs of Miss Saigon, memorising each and every line.  With the influence of her sister, she started liking Les Misérables, the first professional production of a musical she has seen in Manila.  From there on, Christine had been painting caricatures and portraits of stage actors and giving it to them at the stage door. Most of them are from Les Misérables or its alumni. She had been featured on Broadway World on separate occasions and in the gossip section of What’s Onstage. (Up to this day, she doesn’t know why they would place a little tidbit on her in the gossip section.) In 2009, Christine moved to London. She dreams of one day having an art exhibition showcasing two of her passions, painting and theatre.ArtworksThere would be about 50 paintings are done in watercolour on 15” x 20” paper.  Most of which are signed by West End actors. A small picture of the cast holding their art will be place in the frame, if available.Several prints of drawings throughout the years will also be displayed.

The Event

I am aiming to have the art exhibition at the Lower Ground Floor of the Menier Gallery in London in April. The private viewing will be held on the first day of the event. 

Artworks will be divided in different sections:• Les Misérables - This would be the focused of the art exhibition. This will feature the cast from 2014-2016 including Peter Lockyer, David Thaxton, Rachelle Ann Go, Carrie Hope Fletcher, to name a few.• Miss Saigon - This would be before the Les Misérables display and will have the signed art of Sir Cameron Mackintosh at the end of the section.  • Plays - This will feature artworks from the cast of A View From the Bridge, The Ruling Class, Hamlet, and American Buffalo.• Musicals - This would feature actors from different musicals like Book of Mormon, Urinetown, Made in Dagenham and Kinky Boots. • Print - This area will be the featured first. Showing different prints of art from the past.  Tom Hiddleston in Coriolanus, Oliver Seville and Callum Francis as Fiyero and Lola from Wicked and Kinky Boots, the original principal cast of the Book of Mormon in which the art was sold to help those affected by Typhoon Haiyan.

They are a Swiss-based non-profit charity whose goal is to bring doctors anywhere they are needed, ignoring restrictions that would usually be placed on them due to different governments, budget problems or other forces.They've worked to provide COVID-19 relief in over 70 countries worldwide through volunteer-led expeditions; these accomplishments, along with our values to help struggling international individuals, made them the perfect choice to fund.After covering creation, shipping and other budget costs, all of the money will go to ‘Doctors without Borders’,     Funding and BudgetingWhile we plan for all of our profits to go towards ‘Doctors Without Borders’, we have several expenses that must be covered to determine campaign success.Essentially our budget of 750 euros will pay for:   If we fail to raise the sufficient amount of money to cover our costs after the campaign ends, we will proceed to continue our campaign on eBay until the minimum production cost is covered.    Shipping/SchedulePre-orders for FOCUS (A COVID-19 Charity Zine) will run from the 1st of December to the 15th of JanuaryDue to current restrictions on travel and shipment, we have devised a tentative schedule of the projects journey:
1 December- 15 of January- project runs
20th of January- every physical item ordered and digital goods dispensed
Production of items will be from 3 to 1 months (incluiding shipping said items to Head Mod Med for checking quality and packaging)
Delivery estimated in May- End of July (due to potantial virus-caused delays)
In order to maximise our donation, we ask that customers pay for shipping of any physical orders made.For convenience, the zines will be shipped from France and adjust to local shipping prices.France:  Zine- 4 eurosRest of the World (including Europe) :Zine - 8 eurosDue to the almost doubling of costs (especially for international orders), we will not be offering ups tracking with the shipping. If you would like tracking on your order regardless, please contact us at focuscharityzine@gmail.com. Any stretch goals will be included in the packages at no additional cost   Our ArtistsFOCUS is comprised of  16 individual creators who have selflessly volunteered their time and efforts to make a beautiful and positive impact.

We appreciate all the support that you have given this project!The ModsNice to meet you! This zine started as a passion project between three friends stuck during the first major lockdown in Spain. The negative news projected everywhere made us want to make a positive change, while somehow helping the relief effortsOur team is made up of three creatives who just wanted to spread a bit of positivity during this pandemic. We’re all avid art-lovers and we figured this would be the best way for us to do our part to help out, even if we are quite new to zine making!You can find our relevant social medias below our stylized doodles  Questions and ConcernsWe’d like to mention that this is our first time large-scale campaign and, while we’ve tried to have answers to all situations that may arise, if you have any other concerns or questions, please  don’t hesitate to look at our Q&A section or contact us at focuscharityzine@gmail.com or any of our socials. Questions are welcome and help improve the project!Thank You!Last, but certainly not least, we’d like to thank everyone who has helped support this project! Whether you’re someone who’s interested in donating, someone who sent in an application, one of our zine artists, or just simply someone who helped us get the word out, we really appreciate every single one of you and couldn’t have done this without your support. This project has been many months in the making and, thanks to you, we’ve been able to do our part and hope to spread a bit of positivity along the way.Special thank you to Nat Chang (@coldergeist on twitter, tumblr, instagram and carrd) for her endless support during this project. Without her insights, this would not have been possible and her kindness and expertise will forever humble us. Check out her involvement on other zine projects on her socials as well as her personal artwork.Stay safe-The moderators  By purchasing a zine copy, you will receive a magazine made by a multiracial team of creatives that will act as a positive momento for the otherwise unpleasant times while indirectly supporting medical professionals and the international virus victims that they are aiding.

l’est du Canada. La GaleRue d’art s’étend sur plus d’un kilomètre sur la rue commerciale
la plus importante de Montréal, soit la <b>rue Sainte-Catherine</b>, fermée à la
circulation tout l’été dans le centre-sud. Mtl en Arts offre aux visiteurs une
occasion exceptionnelle de rencontrer des artistes issus de toutes les
disciplines des arts visuels, professionnels ou émergents, et de se procurer
une œuvre directement de l’artiste.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Bien plus qu’une exposition en plein air, 
Mtl en Arts offre une programmation diversifiée
: des installations, de la peinture en direct, et plusieurs activités
participatives <span>tout le long du parcours de
l'événement.</span> Près de<b> 50 000
personnes par jour</b> viennent voir la GaleRue d’art à chaque année. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">L’atmosphère <b>conviviale et décontractée</b> crée un terreau
fertile pour l’échange et la rencontre grâce auquel le grand public se
sensibilise et s’initie à l’art. Les artistes, pour leur part, bénéficient
d’une rétroaction directe et immédiate du public, et d’un accès à une toute
nouvelle clientèle. C’est ainsi que l’événement, qui en est à sa <b>16e édition</b>,

<blockquote><i>What's Mtl en Arts?
</i></blockquote>
<p><i>Mtl en Arts is the greatest open air art gallery in eastern Canada. The BoulevArt expands over a
one-kilometre stretch of Montreal’s main artery, Sainte-Catherine Street, closed to the
automobile traffic all summer. The event offers festival goers a unique opportunity to meet artists
from various backgrounds, professionals and emerging artists, and to purchase artworks directly
from the artists. In 2015, close to 120 artists,
exhibitors and performers will take the street during 5 days. Over 200 000 people walk on the
BoulevArt.
</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<p><i>More than an open-air exhibition, Mtl en Arts presents a rich and diversified program: immersive
installations, live painting, interactive projects.
</i></p>
<p><i>Mtl en Arts's convivial and relax atmosphere is a fertile ground for exchanges and encounters,
allowing the public to familiarize with art. The artists can benefit from a direct feedback from the
public and have access to a whole new clientele. This is how for 16 years, Mtl en Arts has been
actively demystifying and democratizing visual arts in the heart of the city of Montreal. <br/></i></p>

The festival "" Mtl in Arts "" needs
you 


Cet été, la rue Sainte Catherine de Montréal est investie
par le 16ème  festival Mtl en Arts, manifestation où des
artistes professionnels et amateurs exposent en pleine rue. L'événement aura lieu du 1er au 5 juillet 2015. Cette année, nous
avons lancé un appel de projet participatif via les réseaux sociaux pour animer
les rues du festival et l’engouement fut tel, que nous avons beaucoup de
projets très intéressants mais pas assez de budget pour tous les réaliser. C’est
pourquoi nous avons décidé de tenter l’expérience Indiegogo  pour récolter des fonds ! 





This summer, Montreal Sainte- Catherine street will litterally be invaded by the 16th edition of festival Mtl in Arts,from July 1 to 5,  with its artists and performers both amateurs and professionnals. This year, we issued an appeal of participative project via the social networks to liven up the streets of the festival and the craze was such, that we got many very interesting projects but not enough budget to realize them all.
That is why we decided to try the experience Indiegogo to collect the necessary funds to realize most of them if not all. 












Mtl en Arts c’est
quoi ? 
Mtl en Arts est la plus grande galerie à ciel ouvert de
l’est du Canada. La GaleRue d’art s’étend sur plus d’un kilomètre sur la rue commerciale
la plus importante de Montréal, soit la rue Sainte-Catherine, fermée à la
circulation tout l’été dans le centre-sud. Mtl en Arts offre aux visiteurs une
occasion exceptionnelle de rencontrer des artistes issus de toutes les
disciplines des arts visuels, professionnels ou émergents, et de se procurer
une œuvre directement de l’artiste.
Bien plus qu’une exposition en plein air, 
Mtl en Arts offre une programmation diversifiée
: des installations, de la peinture en direct, et plusieurs activités
participatives tout le long du parcours de
l'événement. Près de 50 000
personnes par jour viennent voir la GaleRue d’art à chaque année. 
L’atmosphère conviviale et décontractée crée un terreau
fertile pour l’échange et la rencontre grâce auquel le grand public se
sensibilise et s’initie à l’art. Les artistes, pour leur part, bénéficient
d’une rétroaction directe et immédiate du public, et d’un accès à une toute
nouvelle clientèle. C’est ainsi que l’événement, qui en est à sa 16e édition,
orchestre annuellement une démystification et une démocratisation majeure des
arts visuels.



What's Mtl en Arts?

Mtl en Arts is the greatest open air art gallery in eastern Canada. The BoulevArt expands over a
one-kilometre stretch of Montreal’s main artery, Sainte-Catherine Street, closed to the
automobile traffic all summer. The event offers festival goers a unique opportunity to meet artists
from various backgrounds, professionals and emerging artists, and to purchase artworks directly
from the artists. In 2015, close to 120 artists,
exhibitors and performers will take the street during 5 days. Over 200 000 people walk on the
BoulevArt.






More than an open-air exhibition, Mtl en Arts presents a rich and diversified program: immersive
installations, live painting, interactive projects.

Mtl en Arts's convivial and relax atmosphere is a fertile ground for exchanges and encounters,
allowing the public to familiarize with art. The artists can benefit from a direct feedback from the
public and have access to a whole new clientele. This is how for 16 years, Mtl en Arts has been
actively demystifying and democratizing visual arts in the heart of the city of Montreal. 









Projets
participatifs :

Les projets que nous avons reçus sont tous très originaux. Ils  souhaitent  prendre vie sur la rue Sainte Catherine dans le cadre de Mtl en Arts. Nous voulons tout faire pour pouvoir les réaliser ! Il ne nous manque plus qu’un
petit coup de pouce de votre part pour permettre à ses projets de se
réaliser et vous aurez le plaisir d'y participer par la suite ! Les projets impliqueraient la participation d’au moins 50
artistes pendant 3 jours comme des projets d’ateliers créatifs pour enfants, création en
direct, murales collectives, plusieurs installations, des performances et des interventions participatives.Cette année s’annonce comme étant très active et très
originale ! On compte sur vous !Participative projects
The projects  we
received are all very original. They all want to take a live form  along Sainte
Catherine street. We are
only  lacking  a little bit of help from you to allow these  projects to come true! We ask you to help us  realize these projects. The
projects would involve the participation of at least 50 artists during 3 days, like the collective wall, live children workshops , creation, several
installations and performances, and participative interventions.             A quoi serviront les 10 000$ ?

Les 10 000$ serviront à bonifier
le nombre d'animations sur la rue Sainte-Catherine et ce montant sera entièrement utilisé pour les projets participatifs. Le
coût de la réalisation de certains projets est élevé
mais leur portée sociale peut être très importante. Le cachet des
artistes est à prévoir dans la somme ainsi que le coût
du matériel. Idéalement, nous voudrions
financer quinze projets participatifs qui se dérouleront sur trois
jours, du vendredi au dimanche pendant le festival. 
Ces projets vont animer
et donner de la visibilité au festival, grâce notamment aux partages sur les
réseaux sociaux qui devraient être très actifs. 
Grâce au hashtag #mtlenarts que nous placerons près des
installations, nous voulons privilégier la diffusion d’information pour donner
envie au public de venir fouler la rue Sainte Catherine ! 
10,000$ will be used for ?




$10 000 will be used to improve the number of animations on Sainte- Catherine St. and this amount will be completely used for the participative projects. The cost of some projects is important but their social impact can even be more important. The artist’s fee as well as material costs are included. Ideally, we would want to finance fifteen participative projects which will take place for three days, from Friday to Sunday during the festival. 



These projects are going to
give a great  visibility to the festival,
due to the sharings on the social networks which should be very active. 
Thanks to the hashtag #mtlenarts which we shall place near the installations we want to favor the
diffusion of the information.                   Ces projets ont
besoin de vous ! 

Voici donc un bref aperçu des projets. Nous ne souhaitons pas tout dévoiler à l'avance. La surprise sera
plus intense ! Nous pouvons quand même vous assurez que tous les
projets sélectionnés sont formidables ! Notre objectif : animer la rue sainte-Catherine sur la totalité du
site. Plusieurs installations 3D de grandes envergures, des performances
participatives originales qui vous feront passer par
toutes sortes d'émotions, un volet pour les enfants dont un nouveau projet  'Ma première expo' qui est une invitation à
l’intention  des
enfants de 7 à 12 ans qui ont de l’intérêt pour les arts visuels à
venir créer une œuvre en compagnie d’artistes professionnels. Le but est
d’offrir aux enfants une première vitrine au public en y exposant leur œuvre virtuellement.Nous comptons aussi sur  plusieurs artistes dans le cadre d'Art
Battle Canada et du Virus d'improvisation picturale etc... Voici un aperçu de
ce qui pourrait se passer dans le cadre du prochain Mtl en Arts. These
projects need you.



Our objective : liven up Sainte-Catherine St. on the entire site. Several big scales 3D installations, original participative performances which will give you all sorts of emotions. One project for children “My first exhibition“ which is an invitation to the children 7 to 12 years old who have interest for the visual arts to come and create artworks with professional artists. The purpose is to offer the children their first impression of exhibiting their art work to the public.









We also count on several artists from Art Battle Canada and of the Virus of pictorial improvisation etc... Here is an overview of what could take place within the framework of the next Mtl in Arts program.

<h3>Playa Grass Ballet</h3>
<p>Playa Grass Ballet is an organic, nature inspired gathering point on Inner Playa. It is place of shade in the blazing afternoon sun, a cozy crescent shaped amphitheater facing sunrise, a kinetic, moving skyscape viewpoint when looking up through it and a solid, cooling touchstone for grounding at any time.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532622753/gllpxemy7qovl94zfs26.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need fuel and transit expenses. It is a three day journey to Playa using ""Boomer"" the studio’s 1990 International 4600 boom truck with a 14' steel bed. It’s another three day journey back. Our truck runs on Biodiesel or regular diesel. Bio is a bit more difficult to find but that's our preference. With current prices we will incur about $2,000 in diesel costs. The truck also must be oiled and greased for the trip and the hydraulic boom system needs new filters and a top off, another $500. Total ask is $2,500. IndieGoGo gets 5% of whatever we raise here. Any overages will go to offsetting the fabrication costs for Playa Grass Ballet which currently stand above $75,000.</p>
<p>We plan on arriving on Playa Sunday, August 19, building all through Build Week, then sharing the experience during Burn Week and will complete Strike by Wednesday, September 5. Add the six days of RT transit and we are committing 22 days to bringing Playa Grass Ballet to our global tribe at BRC. </p>

<p>Requiem for Greece is a community of Live Action Role Playing Games enthusiasts, created at February 2014. Right now, it numbers more than 70 active players in three major cities in Greece: Athens, Thessaloniki and Heraklion and a Storytelling team of 12.</p>
<p>Our chronicle is based on Vampire: The Requiem (Second Edition) by Onyxpath Publishing and counts over a hundred local live sessions and 8 countrywide gatherings that we like to call Grand Elysiums. It is a political horror game, taking place in an alternative and darker version of our world in the southern country of the Balkan peninsula, Greece.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541430833/afrvgijghwo8669vgt86.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>These larger in scale, cross-city Events are the soul of our community. The backstory for these is created by the ongoing story of our Chronicle.</p>
<p>Players meet in one of the 3 cities to portray their characters and maneuver through the political scene of the dark creatures that are the focus of the story. These events are the best way for our community to get closer and also to connect the dots of the intercity plots.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541430876/ggr8bvruq7fqykpc5w6t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The 9th Grand Elysium will take place  in Thessaloniki (Greece) during the 8th and 9th of December 2018. It will offer around 6 hours of gameplay each day.</p>
<p>The location that has been chosen for the event is an old Jewish inn called Bensousan Han (""han"" in Turkish language means motel or inn) from the Ottoman Era. More info about the building and its history you can find in the links at the end of the description.</p>
<p>A big thanks for all the backers of the first campaign who helped us raise 732 euros for the Event! </p>
<p>Through this campaign we plan to cover the remaining amount of the base costs of the event that include the following:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541430908/cg4zcov59ulyqwu3pc4c.png"" src=""""/>            </p>

<p>Even though the base goal will offer every participant a great LARP experience, we will be able to augment the event with some additions if we reach the following stretch goals.</p>
<p>With a stretch goal of 900 Euros the event will be filmed and a documentation video will be available online!</p>
<p>Further stretch goals will be announced in the future.</p>

<p>Players of ""Requiem For Greece"" will get another chance to participate in a cross-city event that will change the in-game story forever.</p>
<p>Guests will get the chance to leave their daily routine behind for a few hours and be invited to a special Gala. With our help and instructions, they will portray various characters and will have the opportunity to interact with the creatures of our Chronicle.  How immersive this interaction is going to be depends on them and the character they choose...</p>

</h2><p><i>Fragments</i> represents a magical tale inspired by the Black Rock desert:</p><p>""<i>It is said that before the Age of Human Kind, a powerful giant was given a magic mirror by a goddess that allowed him to see into the future. Frightened by what he could foresee he broke the mirror into a thousand fragments which fell from the sky and landed in the desert floor. The sand and winds blew and the pieces began to emerge as mankind too slowly emerged out of obscurity. When thereafter discovered, the mythical site was employed as a magical place for meditation and wisdom. And it is said that the first light of sunrise seen from the top of the highest fragment will bring infinite power and knowledge to those who visit the temple. </i>""</p><p><strong><u>With <i>Fragments</i>, a legend comes to life! </u></strong></p><p><strong><u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555332489/ge6b1jrhrmo8y4imwsag.png"" src=""""/></u></strong></p><p>Marc Ippon de Ronda and Julio Araujo from  PLAC Studio designed a wonderfulanimation to illustrate the legend behind the Fragments temple.

We are extremely glad to have received a 27k Grant from Burning Man, but it only covers a part of  Fragments' total budget of around $150k! We need your help to raise some of the budget.We have set out first goal at 10k to start the pre-production and will need more to keep going!NB: This is an estimate if we can't find recycled materials, volunteers with pro skills. We'd be happy to find all that! See below if you want to help in that way.The more we can raise here, the more amazing Fragments will be  :) Help us take Fragments to Burning Man and we will take a part of you there with us! 
FRAGMENTS' CONCEPT 
Fragments represents a magical tale inspired by the Black Rock desert:""It is said that before the Age of Human Kind, a powerful giant was given a magic mirror by a goddess that allowed him to see into the future. Frightened by what he could foresee he broke the mirror into a thousand fragments which fell from the sky and landed in the desert floor. The sand and winds blew and the pieces began to emerge as mankind too slowly emerged out of obscurity. When thereafter discovered, the mythical site was employed as a magical place for meditation and wisdom. And it is said that the first light of sunrise seen from the top of the highest fragment will bring infinite power and knowledge to those who visit the temple. ""With Fragments, a legend comes to life! Marc Ippon de Ronda and Julio Araujo from  PLAC Studio designed a wonderfulanimation to illustrate the legend behind the Fragments temple. Look at the full video above to see it!HOW WE WILL BUILD FRAGMENTSWe are working hard on the technical aspects to craft a beautiful and safe experience for all the citizens. Marc Ippon de Ronda, Rbhu and ATO Designs have taken into consideration the structural calculations to support the gravitational, wind and live loads across the triangular shards and the central staircase. Most elements will be built on site. During Burning Man, ""Dusters"" will remove dust from Fragments in a daily ritual and circulate it back on the Playa.WHAT YOUR PLEDGE WILL GO TOIn more details, your pledge will help cover:

Materials, production, transportation, installation, and clean up  = approx $90,000

The specialty and safety services who will help us design an impeccable artwork = $35,000

Pre-production and team expenses: (external services, pre-production, architecture, communication, fundraising, press, travel expenses, and food ) = around $25,000

<h3>a children's art studio</h3>
<p>Love Lab Studio is about taking action, with children and community, to co-create a better + more just world for all. That sounds utopian, but we think that experimenting, with imagination, intention, and reflection, to co-create a better world is part of our work as human beings. And this starts with a children's studio.</p>
<p>Our studio is founded by artist Christina Bechstein (with awesome neighbors + collaborators) to support us all to make conscious creativity happen with simple materials, strategies, projects and tools that are good for us AND the environment.</p>
<p>Our bright new space will be thoughtfully curated for the needs of the children. We are located in a mixed residential and retail neighborhood in the West End of Portland, at the edge of a beautiful park and playground. We will support the tending of trees and plants at a nearby food forest, and plan to eventually harvest plums and make jam together!</p>
<h3>love lab studio: what will we do?</h3>
<p>Everything we do centers the art studio as both a place and an idea of creativity and imagination.One of our inspirations is the work of Detroit arts leader Josephine Herrald Love, who shared with us that ""in art, allow the child to teach you about them - you are the learner, they are the teacher.”  Another is the child-centered and creative pedagogy developed in Reggio Emilia, Italy by Loris Malaguzzi. This places the “atelier” or art studio in the center of the learning environment as a collaborative element in the creation of projects and learning.</p>
<p>In summer 2018 our work is to launch the studio  &amp; the community public art clay tile project.</p>
<p>For fall 2018, programming includes:</p>
<p><strong>1. Children's art workshops.</strong></p>
<p>Weekly + seasonal art workshops for children. Each workshop will incorporate natural materials and creative prompts, and respond to themes connected to the greater world around us, contemporary artists, nature and more.</p>
<p><strong>2. Saplings Studio.</strong></p>
<p>A creative, part-time learning + afterschool program. Co-created by a skilled teacher collaborative and offers hands-on learning in a joyful and playful atmosphere. Children engage in creative exploration of art, integrated reading and writing, and math skill development based in problem-solving. They learn in nature, in the community, and with each other. We value: the whole child through embodiment, diversity and inclusion within a caring community; the child as poet, communicator + participant through language development; the child as co-creator with project-based and individual learning; the child as artist through arts, creativity + imagination; and the child as community member, global &amp; ecological citizen through community projects.</p>
<p><strong>3. Community projects.</strong></p>
<p>The studio will offer monthly First Friday art exhibitions that focus on work by children and the community. We'll also be collaborating with organizations, community members and neighbors on specific projects. Some of the projects we partner with and collaborate on currently include: The Portland Lantern Walk, a creative community and public art series that culminates in a large-scale community event in Deering Oaks Park, with Annie Leahy and Friends of Deering Oaks Park. Sister Makings is a group that meets regularly to co-create space for local and new neighbor sisters and their children to gather around conversation, food, service, gardening and craft. Community partners include Heartfelt School and Cultivating Community.</p>
<h3>artists + teachers + caregivers: who we are</h3>
<p>We are led by and collaborate with a caring group of teachers, artists, caregivers and community members. Our teachers are trained and skilled in a variety of pedagogies and skills including: studio art and craft, <a href=""https://waldorfeducation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Waldorf</a>, <a href=""https://nylc.org/service-learning/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">service learning</a>, public school, <a href=""https://readingandwritingproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Teachers College Reading and Writing Program</a>, <a href=""http://www.social-sculpture.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">social sculpture,</a>  <a href=""https://www.reggioalliance.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reggio Emilia</a>, and more. Additionally, part of our team will include our community partners and community advisors. Love Lab Studio was founded by Christina Bechstein, a local artist, mother to Melu (age 6!) and educator. Christina has years of training and experience as a teacher of children, an art teacher, as associate professor of art and as a practicing community and public artist. She is grateful to have had wonderful mentors, and has a long record of creative, collaborative and community achievements and work.</p>

<h3>opening the doors: what's needed</h3>
<p>There are basic renovation costs to get the studio up and running!</p>
<p>We are grateful for the skilled design and construction support of the <a href=""http://www.barrettmade.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Barrett Made</a> team in Portland, Maine.

<p>NUTS + BOLTS We currently need to raise $20,000 to support the renovation of the space! The costs that will be covered in this amount in addition to permitting and design fees include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Drawing + reading + visiting window nooks</strong> Cozy &amp; inviting window seating for children and community with bright and soft cushions. Simple birch plywood seats with a plexi guard at the window will provide protection for little ones.</li>
<li>
<strong>Art + tool hanging</strong> Giant sheets of homasote will be installed on walls with screws + washers and painted, to hold art and supporting sound absorption. Additional hanging systems influenced by the creative wisdom of the Shaker community will layer in pegs for hanging as needed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Doors</strong> Safe, dry and warm front door and bathroom door with threshold (ADA compliant).</li>
<li>
<strong>Tracks for curtains + track lighting</strong> Lighting for space and tracks for felt and voile curtains to divide and create a flexible and gorgeous working space.</li>
<li>
<strong>Community clay wall + washing basin</strong> A long, narrow 6-foot farm sink will allow children to wash brushes and hands together. Above the washing sink will be a gorgeous community public art mosaic wall of small handmade clay tiles, each covered with marks made by children from Portland’s parks, food forests and urban gardens. Please note: additional patrons of public art clay wall needed.</li>
<li>
<strong>Paint</strong> We will use soft yellows, cool blues and other colors from nature to support creativity and co-regulation of community and children in the space.</li>
<li>
<strong>Signage</strong> Bright and joyful signage to hang outside and inside the space with names of all who contributed to the studio!</li>
</ul>
<p>If additional funds are raised over our goal, they will support the cost of furniture, art supplies, a temporary accessibility ramp as needed, and the goal of funding a number of free spaces in every single children's class that we offer.</p>
<h3>your gift will give</h3>
<p>We believe in one human family and in the rights of every child. So the money raised isn't just about the art studio. Love Lab Studio campaign will also donate 10% of all funds raised to support <a href=""https://www.raicestexas.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">RAICES</a> Family Reunification Fund.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Help Us Bring the Mad Sorcerer's Workshop To the Playa!</h3>
<p>We've formed this campaign to raise funds to help bring the New York Region's Guild project to the playa.</p>
<p>The Regional art installations at Burning Man are positioned on the Midway -- a circle of carnival-like craft and gaming awesomeness booths around the base of the Man.  This year, keeping with the DaVinci theme, the Regional installations are called ""Guild Workshops"", and are made to resemble medieval artisan guilds.  The guild representing New York is called, The Mad Sorcerer's Workshop, and we're perfectly positioned at 4 o'clock on the Midway:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469865021/bdzqficdaiq8kpv7kqvk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We think anyone can be a budding Vinci-esque sculptor, and we're here to help you get started.  We use modeling clay and encouragement to help visitors express their creativity, no matter their level of dexterity.  Each visitor will make a creature out of play-doh.  So, if you make a green cow, and I make a polka dot tree, together our creatures form an alien pastoral scene.  Now, put them into a custom-made multi-level infinity box, and there's a whole herd of awesome cows grazing by a forest of trees.  </p>
<p>  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>The project's mission is to evoke images of medieval sorcerers and mages, who would mess around with the elements, create homunculi and other odd mythical creatures, and generally control their versions of the universe. That's why we're calling the booth Mad Sorcerer's Workshop!!! ​</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Make</b>  a little clay Man, put him inside an infinity cabinet, and start a whole new world, populated by hundreds little clay homunculi.  And if the next person who comes into the booth makes a little clay UFO, then your Man and their UFO will interact, and the world just got interesting!  The more visitors we get, the more worlds within worlds we build.</p>
<p><strong>Who</strong> is this for?  Kids aged 2 to 102.</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong> contribute?  To help bring a kid-friendly project to the playa!  We invite participants of all ages and abilities to explore and express their creativity, and both kids and adults can volunteer to help at the booth!  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>We aim to support everyone's creative ability</strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>....even if they think they don't have any!</strong></i></p>

The Regional art installations at Burning Man are positioned on the Midway -- a circle of carnival-like craft and gaming awesomeness booths around the base of the Man.  This year, keeping with the DaVinci theme, the Regional installations are called ""Guild Workshops"", and are made to resemble medieval artisan guilds.  The guild representing New York is called, The Mad Sorcerer's Workshop, and we're perfectly positioned at 4 o'clock on the Midway:

 
We think anyone can be a budding Vinci-esque sculptor, and we're here to help you get started.  We use modeling clay and encouragement to help visitors express their creativity, no matter their level of dexterity.  Each visitor will make a creature out of play-doh.  So, if you make a green cow, and I make a polka dot tree, together our creatures form an alien pastoral scene.  Now, put them into a custom-made multi-level infinity box, and there's a whole herd of awesome cows grazing by a forest of trees.  
  
The project's mission is to evoke images of medieval sorcerers and mages, who would mess around with the elements, create homunculi and other odd mythical creatures, and generally control their versions of the universe. That's why we're calling the booth Mad Sorcerer's Workshop!!! ​
 
Make  a little clay Man, put him inside an infinity cabinet, and start a whole new world, populated by hundreds little clay homunculi.  And if the next person who comes into the booth makes a little clay UFO, then your Man and their UFO will interact, and the world just got interesting!  The more visitors we get, the more worlds within worlds we build.
Who is this for?  Kids aged 2 to 102.
Why contribute?  To help bring a kid-friendly project to the playa!  We invite participants of all ages and abilities to explore and express their creativity, and both kids and adults can volunteer to help at the booth!  
We aim to support everyone's creative ability
....even if they think they don't have any!
 

What We Need & What You Get

We are seeking to raise $3000 to cover 
Event insurance
Truck Rental
Last-minute and unexpected supplies
Helping low-income crew members with travel costs 


The Impact

The project allows people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities to interact collaboratively.
We're help break the ice, so visitors can meet and chat over the crafting table.
It's fun!!!

We can't thank you enough, and we can't wait to see you under the Tree of Ténéré. Meet the teamALEX GREEN, CO-LEAD ARTIST & SYMMETRY LABS CEOMy work as an artist and technologist bridges the digital and physical worlds. Before pursuing interactive art I was a physicist and jazz musician; both science and music remain lasting sources of inspiration in my work. I try to push the boundaries of both knowledge and expression through art -- often my projects require technological innovation as well as custom fabrication.Over the last few years, I've been focused on building modular ""light instruments"": volumetric lighting blocks with sophisticated software that can be played like a musical instrument. My work has been featured in Gizmodo, Creators Project, Discovery Channel’s In The Making, an upcoming PBS documentary on the future of art called Ineffable with violinist Tim Fain, and in music videos for Eric Prydz and Cathedrals. I've done light sculptures for Google, Cisco, Dreamforce, and many others.I've had the chance to perform at festivals around the world, including the Future of Storytelling, Treasure Island Music Festival, and Cannes Lions Innovation Festival, where I gave the keynote on “Beyond Sound: The Music Experience of the Future”. I'm thrilled to be bringing Ténéré to the world in 2017. MARK SLEE, CO-LEAD ARTISTMy visual art draws heavily on a background in computer programming. I develop algorithmic patterns inspired both by organic and mathematical process, employing procedural motion, subtle variation, and evolving shifts in form and hue. I find it fascinating to explore the way our visual perception works, and my goal is to create vivid, colorful experiences that are pleasing both aesthetically and intellectually - pretty lights can tickle both mind and soul.I've been developing an open-source stack for LED animation called LX since my first playa light-art installation at my second Burn in 2010. That system has gone on to see use in a variety of major installations, by myself and others. But Ténéré has to be one of the most audacious canvases I've ever seen envisioned, and I'm super excited to be creating for it. ZACHARY SMITH, CO-CREATOR I couldn't be prouder of the incredible team working to make Ténéré a reality, and I've been blown away by the support we've received from people all over the world. I spend most of my time on project management, fundraising (we need your support!), and creative direction.By day I'm an entrepreneur and product manager. I live in San Francisco with my wife Sophie. PATRICK DEEGAN, PHD, CO-CREATORI build intelligent and self-sovereign robots and am fascinated by the potential of technology, applied to the advancement of society for the benefit of all. I have been attending Burning Man since 1996. This year, I'm excited to bring a wealth of technical experience to the task of creating an open-platform that is at the intersection of art, interaction, and digital identity.  I'm inspired by an amazing team and the really beautiful vision we share, to illuminate and support transformational synergies with technology and offer an experience of transcendent oneness with nature and each other. TANNER BEREE, DIGITAL MEDIA LEADAfter my first burn I knew that becoming involved with an art project was in my future. As always the Playa provided; this time with The Tree of Ténéré. I work as a visual storyteller and couldn’t be more excited to document the journey of bringing this amazing piece of artwork to the world.Come find me under the LED canopy of Ténéré! RIWA HARFOUSH, COMMUNITY BUILDERIf the playa has taught me anything, it's the exponential nature of generosity. My fiancee Alex and I have felt how worthwhile our time, effort and love has been in building our camp (The Pineapple Motel) when we see our family of Pineapples come together each year to build our home in the dust. This year, we're looking beyond our little community and are so excited to rally an even larger family around this beautiful piece of art that can be experienced by all. NATHANIEL HEDGES, BUILD TEAMI moved to San Francisco from Honolulu. For eleven years I was a trauma medic/deep-sea-diver in the United States Navy, and recently I made the transition to studying furniture/product design at California College of the Arts (CCA). I love to bike and sail, and I'm passionate about Muay Thai and avidly committed to physical fitness/personal wellness.With encouragement from friends and family, I ventured into developing large-scale art installations for the Burning Man community. I'm grateful for an amazing community of Bay Area Burner friends and can't wait to see you all under Ténéré! MATT HERRICK, FUNDRAISING LEADAfter running fundraising for 2016's ""Catacomb of Veils,"" I swore that I would take this year off. However, Ténére's beauty and audaciousness inspired me to join the team. I am also a lead for Epic, Burning Man's ""World Series of Poker"" theme camp. In the default world, I live in San Francisco and work in enterprise sales. CLAY SADER, PROGRAMMING LEADI'm so incredibly excited to be a part of bringing Ténéré to the Burning Man community. Last year while being a small part of building Catacomb of Veils, I learned about the power of building spaces for healing and exploration. This year I'm proud be be bringing some of what I learned to help create this space of beauty, magic, and community. I cannot wait to lounge in the shade (and light) of Ténéré and see the community experience it for themselves.I live in SF, but I spend most of my time in the default world in Africa and elsewhere, working to build software in the developing world to strengthen healthcare, crisis response, and development systems. STEVE TAM, COMMUNITY & CROWDFUNDINGI help organize the Pineapple Motel camp and am excited about building the narrative and community around Ténéré. 2017 will be my fourth burn and I am looking forward to finally contributing to an artistically and experientially driven piece of magic on the playa.During the day I work in brand and marketing for an AI company. I helped launch Daybreaker in Toronto and now live with my wife in NYC. ALEXANDRE TERRIEN, FUNDRAISINGI'm the co-founder of the Pineapple Motel camp and better known as ""Monkey"" on the playa. I'm a dedicated Burner and community builder and so excited to bring Ténéré to the playa. SHLOMO ZIPPEL, HARDWARE ENGINEER & ARTISTI really enjoy combining art and engineering, and Burning Man provides ample opportunities to do so. I brought various projects to the playa over the years: climbable installations, art cars, and shiny wearables. It is great being part of a team and a project that is combing all of the above.You can find me at various hackerspaces in San Francisco working on Light Layer, helping makers add interactive LEDs to their costumes and art installations. JEFFREY ORD, BUILD TEAMComing soon JOSH ELBAZ, PROJECT MANAGERI manage hospital construction projects in Montreal. Throughout my career, I've learned to appreciate how beautiful art and light can affect the lives of patients and staff, and how these can help to heal the mind, body, and spirit. My hope is that the Tree of Ténéré will too have this effect on many Burners this summer, and so it is my great pleasure to collaborate with this amazing team to help bring this vision to fruition. TYLER GOIN, FUNDRAISINGOver five trips to Burning Man, I've developed a special bond to Black Rock City, especially around the unique collection of art, nature and people. For me, Burning Man is an expression of what humanity is capable of, and a reminder for how much stronger we are when we work together then we are divided. I believe deeply that facilitating the construction of a lonely tree in the desert for people to gather and come together is a beacon of hope and beauty in these tumultuous times.  Donations are tax deductible thanks to our fiscal sponsor, Gray Area Foundation for the Arts.",20.0,2,"3 Campaigns

<p>Infinity Vetro Project aims to preserve the 800-year-old glassblowing tradition in Tuscany, Italy by establishing a school, gallery and cultural center in the center of Florence. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $150,000 in 50 days to launch the first phase of the project, which includes securing and building out a studio space, obtaining necessary permits, purchasing certified specialized equipment, and covering operating costs during the first three months of programming.</p>
<p><strong>Tuscany and Glassblowing  - A long history; a new opportunity</strong></p>
<p>Italy is known throughout the world for its rich glassblowing tradition, and the Tuscan region has been a part of this tradition for nearly 800 years. Since medieval times, Florentine glass workers have passed their knowledge and skills from generation to generation at the furnaces of the many glass factories that thrived there until recent years.  Today, just one out of the forty factories specializing in hand blown glass that existed in the region 60 years ago still remains. </p>
<p>As competition with foreign glass factories increases, more and more historically important furnaces throughout Italy, and the rest of the world, are closing. The industry of handmade glass is no longer sustainable as a business model, yet the art of glassblowing is an important part of our cultural heritage and it should be preserved for future generations. </p>
<p>An artistic glassblowing school would change the course of the future of glassblowing in region of Tuscany by providing a new avenue for maestros to share their skills and experience, while also making the activity relevant and accessible to the next generation and allowing them to experience it in a fun, exciting and contemporary way.</p>
<p><strong>What is Infinity Vetro Project?</strong></p>
<p>Infinity Vetro Project’s goal is to preserve the rich history of glass working in Tuscany by offering courses and workshops in glassblowing taught by maestros from the region, and creating an opportunity for both locals and visitors to our region to connect with the glassmaking tradition in an exciting and meaningful way. By removing the art of glassblowing from the factory setting and placing it the realm of an art studio, we hope to inspire a glass renaissance similar to the American Studio Glass Movement of 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Our dream is to provide a comprehensive glass experience for people from a wide range of backgrounds and experience levels. We’ll start with “experience” classes for travelers and curious locals, then, we’ll build programming for more dedicated students, providing a place for them to learn, and then practice their skills by renting studio time. A small gallery space will be dedicated to showing instructor and advanced student work, and later, we’ll add a bar/café offering regional food and drinks (with proceeds supporting school operations). Plans for children’s programming are already in development, modeled on the wildly successful Kids Design Glass program at the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, WA. As we progress, we’ll add courses and programs for more advanced artists as well, including week-long advanced classes by internationally known artists and an artist-in-residence program.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 1: Making it happen</strong></p>
<p>The first phase of the Infinity Vetro Project includes securing and building out a small studio with a gallery space, obtaining necessary permits, purchasing certified specialized, environmentally sound equipment, and covering marketing and operating costs during the first three months of offering classes and workshops. Our goal is to have the school up and running by July of 2013, and that it will be self-sustaining within one year. </p>
<p><strong>Phase 1 Budget:</strong></p>
<p>Equipment Purchase:</p>
<p>€18,000  50kg glass furnace (where glass is prepared, melted and stored)</p>

<p>American glass artist Isak Lystad is the founder and director of Infinity Vetro Project. Originally a trained chef, Isak began his study of glass in 2003, surrounded by a large community of talented glass artists in Seattle, Washington.</p>
<p>After 6 months of dedicated study, he left his job as a chef and began working as a glassblower full-time. For the next four years, he spent all of his free time blowing glass and attending demonstrations, glass studios, galleries, and museums in an effort to learn as much as he could about the material. Isak’s time in Seattle provided a solid foundation of knowledge and skills for using glass as an artistic medium, as well as endless inspiration and a sense that anything is possible.</p>
<p>At the end of 2007, Isak and his wife had the opportunity to invest in a property in Tuscany. Only after discovering that there was glassblowing in the region, did they decide to make the move. Initially Isak worked in a factory with some Tuscan maestros, but with economic crisis at the end of 2008, many of the glassblowing factories began to struggle and he was eventually let go. With no glassblowing prospects, Isak returned to cooking, and began building his private glass studio in his free time, which he finished in November of 2011.</p>
<p>Although he will always love cooking, his true passion is for glass, and sharing that passion with others. In the Infinity Vetro Project, he has found a cause worth fighting for, a place where he knows he can make a lasting difference.

We will defeat this by continuing to unite our entire community until we achieve true liberation for all.” - Movement for Justice in El Barrio</em></p>
<p>In December of 2004, after enduring years of inhumane living conditions and abuse from their negligent landlord, <strong>a fearless group of Latina immigrants</strong> residing in several buildings in New York City’s historic East Harlem came together and formed<strong> Movement for Justice in El Barrio,</strong> as a way to fight back against landlords who rake in profits by tormenting and illegally evicting tenants.</p>
<p>Since coming together in these initial buildings, we have blanketed El Barrio, going door-to-door to build a grassroots, community-wide movement for dignity and against displacement that is<strong> led by hundreds of low-income people of color, women, and immigrants</strong> residing in <strong>over 70 buildings </strong>across the neighborhood. Today, we remain a predominantly women-of-color and immigrant organization that operates on the principles of <strong>self-determination, autonomy, and participatory democracy</strong>. We believe those who suffer injustice firsthand must design and lead their own struggles for justice.</p>
<p>Throughout our 8 year history, we have taken on and defeated some of the worst and most powerful landlords in New York City, including consecutive victories against one of the <em>Village Voice</em>’s <strong>“10 Worst Landlords of NYC”</strong> and a now-defunct multi-national corporation from the U.K. We have held complicit politicians and city institutions accountable to the low-income residents of El Barrio. We have built a culture of resistance and a community of solidarity.</p>
<p><em><strong>Help us celebrate our 8<sup>th</sup> Anniversary by donating to sustain our struggle in the coming year! Our humble goal is to raise $8,000 by the end of December—with your support we can make it happen.

In December of 2004, after enduring years of inhumane living conditions and abuse from their negligent landlord, a fearless group of Latina immigrants residing in several buildings in New York City’s historic East Harlem came together and formed Movement for Justice in El Barrio, as a way to fight back against landlords who rake in profits by tormenting and illegally evicting tenants.
Since coming together in these initial buildings, we have blanketed El Barrio, going door-to-door to build a grassroots, community-wide movement for dignity and against displacement that is led by hundreds of low-income people of color, women, and immigrants residing in over 70 buildings across the neighborhood. Today, we remain a predominantly women-of-color and immigrant organization that operates on the principles of self-determination, autonomy, and participatory democracy. We believe those who suffer injustice firsthand must design and lead their own struggles for justice.
Throughout our 8 year history, we have taken on and defeated some of the worst and most powerful landlords in New York City, including consecutive victories against one of the Village Voice’s “10 Worst Landlords of NYC” and a now-defunct multi-national corporation from the U.K. We have held complicit politicians and city institutions accountable to the low-income residents of El Barrio. We have built a culture of resistance and a community of solidarity.
Help us celebrate our 8th Anniversary by donating to sustain our struggle in the coming year! Our humble goal is to raise $8,000 by the end of December—with your support we can make it happen. All proceeds from this Indiegogo project will go towards our day-to-day fight for dignified living conditions and against displacement in El Barrio and beyond, and will ensure that we can continue building on...

8 years of grassroots, community-led resistance to gentrification/displacement and neoliberalism in El Barrio!

8 years of building a social justice organization based on self-determination, paticipatory democracy, and autonomy!

8 years of landmark victories against millionaire slumlords, corrupt politicians, and failing city insitutions!

8 years of breaking down borders and supporting movements from NYC to South Africa and beyond!

8 years of fighting sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, classism, and other forms of oppression!

8 AÑOS EN LA LUCHA POR OTRO MUNDO POSIBLE! / 8 YEARS OF STRUGGLE FOR AN ""OTHER"" POSSIBLE WORLD!


""We fight so that: The oceans and mountains will belong to those that live in and take care of them. The rivers and deserts will belong to those that live in and take care of them. The valleys and ravines will belong to those that live in and take care of them. Homes and cities will belong to those who live in and take care of them. No one will own more land than they can cultivate. No one will own more homes than they can live in.""- Movement for Justice in El Barrio",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Who I AM</h3>
<p>I am Carla and I'm a local Atlanta-based visual artist and writer. For people like me, it is difficult to fund my own art exhibition. Most can work many jobs, others have gracious family members that will help. I have neither at the current moment. For years now I've been working on this new series and I'm seizing this opportunity to exhibit my collages to the public.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I need from everyone is enough funds to purchase frames and libations for the exhibtion. Small donations will receive 5x7 in. signed digital glossy prints while large donations will receive single edition 10x15 in. specialty prints. All together, each donator will be able to own a piece of work as a collector and my lifelong appreciation of your warm gesture. Names of all donators will be showcased throughout the exhibition at City of Ink.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this campaign is crucial to the body of work and the concept behind it. In the American South, through the mix of racism and country politics, I find that no matter where you go, Southern people of all colors have the hospitality that is known to the region. We help one another when in need. We listen to one another when one needs to be heard. Please be the one to help me today. It's rare that I ask for help and now is the time to ask.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot donate money to my campaign then please send this information to a family member, coworker and/or friend. If you are in the Atlanta area, then please come out to the exhibition on 3 May 2013. I want you to have a grand time with me as I unveil my latest body of work and recreate an atmosphere that I loved in my youth. This night is for those that live and love the Dirty South. Long Live the Dirty South, y'all. Peace.</p>

<p>Imagine the Merry Pranksters taking to the road in 2013. Well, we are not the Merry Pranksters, but we are merry, and we are pranksters, and we hope someday to see Wavy Gravy walking his fish down main street. Picture, if you would, for real, the Burning Man mutant vehicle, and David Best sculpture, <strong>Temple Bus</strong>, on the highway as centerpiece for a west coast music Road Show! Might even have jugglers and clowns….</p>
<p>The goal is set to support a roadshow tour. Partial funding will ensure the curation of Temple Bus.</p>
<p>We are the <strong>Douglas Arts and Humanities Association</strong> (AKA: The Grand Theatre), a 501(c)3 non-profit community arts organization. Contributions to this campaign are tax deductible. Our goal is to preserve the Temple Bus as a work of art. Some larger mutant vehicle creations have been lost, for example: La Contessa, the wonderful pirate ship who once sailed the Playa. Patrick Dailey, caretaker (pink-slip holder) for Temple Bus has a home for her here in Arizona.</p>
<p>Here is the deal. After several years at Burning Man, serving as support vehicle for the temple build and public enjoyment during the event, the Temple Bus is heading for a new home in the Douglas/Bisbee, Arizona locale. She has been stored in the Petaluma, CA since she was built. The local authorities are in the process of condemning the storage yard where Temple Bus lives, and a new home is in order.</p>
<p>This campaign addresses the relocation of Temple Bus. Safe haven for her is in place here in Arizona. We wish to create an event around the move in the form of a music road show with five free concerts along the way. The concert locations are SF Bay area, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Tucson and Bisbee/Douglas.</p>
<p>The Road Show is a self-contained caravan of musicians and other performance artists, roadies, drivers, mechanics, groupies, hangers-on, and some folks who think the Grateful Dead are still on tour. The original music of Dan Simonis (The West Texas Millionares) and Bruce Northey (Wall of Dreamers) will rock center stage … and yes, you can dance all you want. Bring a picnic basket.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is to fund this tour. If we reach our goal, the Road Show will hit the road in autumn, 2013. The tour is one week. The funding goal is $40,000. This will provide for the basic costs of the caravan support vehicles (gas and oil, etc.), modest compensation for the performance artists, stage crew and film crew, food and lodging costs (we’re talking shopping at Safeway and staying in campgrounds), theater equipment rental (stage, lighting, sound), insurance (a special rider for our existing liability policy), audio and video documentation, and preparing the Temple Bus for safe highway travel. The concerts are free to the public.</p>
<p>What’s in this for you the contributor. First, your contribution is tax deductible. Second, you can feel good about securing the long-term preservation of this work of art. Third, this project will be documented as part of Wall of Dreamers film project (an Indiegogo project). The Perk delivery date is based on the audio post production schedule.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach the goal, we will trim the concert program as needed. The basic priority is keeping the Temple Bus in safe mechanical condition and funding travel costs associated with the relocation. If we exceed our goal, funds will go toward higher quality audio and film documentation, guest artists, maintenance fund for Temple Bus, and maybe a new set of tires.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this. Any funding received goes first to the preservation of the Temple Bus. Even a few thousand dollars will secure the future for Temple Bus. If the goal is far exceeded, excess funds will go to historic preservation of the Grand Theatre. Our tax records are public information. Tax ID 86-0339959. Thanks for considering our campaign and sharing our dream.</p>

<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
<p>My name is Dóra Votin. I am an Hungarian artist. I started to work as a freelance painter and a graphic designer in 2000. I
am a mother of three and have tried to earn my living through my art. Since Hungary is a
small country and there are many talented artists, I thought I would try to look around the world and show my art abroad. </p>
<p>Last year,
Agora Gallery, NY discovered my website and offered representation, promotion
and exhibition of my artworks there in New York City. Because of the expenses (shipping,
promotinal costs, etc.) it took me until now to decide what to do. Finally, I
decided to give it a try... This is a great challenge for me! </p>
<p>My paintings have been accepted and soon I will sign the agreement. </p>
<p>All I need
now is your support to get my art to NYC! Without that I have no chance to obtain all I need for this big opportunity.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>What Will Cover the Cost of This Campaign?</b></h3>
<p>The 
goal of this project is 7.050 USD</p>
<ul>
<li>For promotion, exhibition for
     18 months included in the representation agreement: 3.850 USD</li>
<li>For shipping the art pieces
     from Hungary to the States: 2.300 USD</li>
<li>For the flight (2 times in that
     period): 900 USD</li>
<li>If I exceed the goal of my
     campaign it may cover the costs of international customs fees and
     accomodation in NY.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any amount
of contribution is welcome!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>About My Paintings</b></h3>
<p>The theme of
the series of paintings I am planning to exhibit in NYC is based on one of Béla
Bartók’s ideas about going back to the clean and clear source. I started to search
for this clear source in the field of visual art in the Hungarian context when I arrived at the motifs of Hungarian folk art. These motifs vary in forms
and colors from region to region. I have chosen some of them and started to
open up their symbolic meaning, and redefined them in the context of our
postmodern time. This series is about women and being feminine. My plan is to continue this
theme and integrate it with other motifs.</p>
<p>I painted
them in oil on canvas, however as you can see on my website I can use different
mediums and technics depending on what I want to express.</p>
<p>For me it
would be a fantastic encouragement to reach my goal and get to NYC. It is not
only about going there and selling paintings. It is more about experiencing a setting where people love art and are interested in it. That would be a
sign for me that it is worth painting and being creative and would give me further encouragement to continue my painting.</p>
<p>Of couse, it
would be a great privilege to show these art pieces in New York City or anywhere in
the States! </p>

<p><a href=""http://radicalmycologyconvergence.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Radical Mycology Convergence</a> is happening in Orangeville, Illinois in mid-October, and I would
love to attend. While their main focus is mushrooms, they will have several
workshops that focus on lichens. These workshops will cover various topics such
as how to do chemical spot tests for lichen identification, how to properly
collect and preserve specimens, how to read growth patterns in order to use
lichens as environmental bioindicators, and how to use lichens in natural dyes.
By attending this event, not only will I gain these valuable skills, I will also
be able to study lichens in the U.S. for the first time. Which is kinda crazy
right? I've only ever studied lichens in Ireland! It's high time I got familiar
with the lichens here on my home soil. </p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/835344/files/20140904235800-DSCN7347.JPG?1409900280"" src="""" style=""width: 394.272884283247px; height: 526px;""/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><h3>
</h3><h3>Ok, so you need money to make this happen. What exactly are you going to be spending it on though? </h3>
<p>- Registration fees for the
Radical Mycology Convergence. There is no set fee for the event. Their
suggested donation is between $50 and $300 depending on how much of the weekend
you plan on attending. They encourage people to help volunteer for various
tasks during the weekend if they cannot afford the full registration fee. So of
course I plan on volunteering as much as I can without it hindering my ability
to take advantage of the workshops that I really want to attend. This obviously
cannot offset the full registration fee however, so the more I raise, the more
I can contribute. </p>
<p>- Transportation costs. The
event is in Orangeville, IL, so about two hours outside of Chicago. I will be
carpooling with other members of the mycological society who are attending from
Chicago, so I will need money to contribute towards gas. </p>
<p>- Camping equipment. Again,
this event is two hours outside of Chicago. It is held on farmland and the
majority of attendees camp on the event grounds for the weekend since there isn't a lot of
convenient accommodation around.  I need basic camping equipment to cover
my accommodation for the weekend. I've done some shopping around online and it
appears I can get everything I need, in decent quality, for a little over $150.
This may seem like a large expense to incur for a one-time event, but the
majority of lichenological events that I would like to attend in the future
require the ability to camp out where the lichens are. So in reality this is an investment that will enable me to keep hunting down lichens, not
simply a once and done expense. </p>
<p>- The last bit that I need
help covering is all of the seemingly small costs that add up quickly. I need to cover food for
the weekend, new batteries and memory card for my camera, materials to
transport any specimens collected. Etc. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/836814/files/20140905114914-IMG_3214.jpg?1409942954"" src="""" style=""width: 425.73058637083994px; height: 562px;""/></p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>But Timmi, what do I get in return for my generous donation?</h3><p>THIS IS THE BEST PART! I have a selection of lichen goodies for you all! You have probably
seen the various lichen photos I’ve posted on social media, and this is a
perfect way for you to take home a lichen of your own. You can choose from
stickers, prints of the photos, or even hand embroidered lichens of your very
own. The stickers and photos will be delivered to you as soon as the campaign
is over. Since the embroidered lichens take a bit more time to create (but not
nearly as much time as growing your own lichen!) you should expect to receive
your completed lichen sometime in November depending on how I can fit them in
around my law school workload. </p><p><br/></p>

My mission is to of course solicit your help for this project, but to also inspire you to pursue the things in life that you are most passionate about. I'm an artist who also loves technology, entrepreneurship, and community. After years of hurt, challenges, natural and spiritual struggles with life, losing a son to cancer, and divorce shortly afterwards, I should be running away from this path, hiding under a rock, and saying to heck with it all...</p>
<p>...But I'm not. This year I want to step out on faith, a very detailed business plan, a clear understanding of my goals, and a ton of passion, to open up a retail arts store called Airbrush4Life.</p>

<p>One of the goals of Airbrush4life is to provide an afterschool program that would be free for the kids in the community that will teach them about entrepreneurship by exposing them to my story, my entrepreneurial training received by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, and of course my airbrushing skills. </p>

Now, of course the typical airbrush artist doesn't need an investment so huge that a loan is needed to get it started. However, I am not just trying to open a store...I am trying to provide something that will make a HUGE impact in the community that it will reside in.</p>
<p>The main goal is $30,000. This will provide the type of atmosphere that will attract all types of customers. It will provide the tools that our artist will need to be the most creative. It will provide the marketing materials needed to sell ourselves and promote our brand. </p>

<p>I am fully aware that I cannot expect this campaign to be fully funded by the generosity of others, although that would be nice. Therefor I am organizing a launch party fundraiser to raise a portion of this money and market my business at the same time. Below are some of those videos.</p>

Losing a child to cancer. Divorce right after. Two of the worse things a person could go through yet I continue to press through. This is my request.
My name is Marcus Robinson and I'm on a mission. My mission is to of course solicit your help for this project, but to also inspire you to pursue the things in life that you are most passionate about. I'm an artist who also loves technology, entrepreneurship, and community. After years of hurt, challenges, natural and spiritual struggles with life, losing a son to cancer, and divorce shortly afterwards, I should be running away from this path, hiding under a rock, and saying to heck with it all...
...But I'm not. This year I want to step out on faith, a very detailed business plan, a clear understanding of my goals, and a ton of passion, to open up a retail arts store called Airbrush4Life.


Entrepreneurial Arts Program

One of the goals of Airbrush4life is to provide an afterschool program that would be free for the kids in the community that will teach them about entrepreneurship by exposing them to my story, my entrepreneurial training received by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship, and of course my airbrushing skills. 
   Our Plea for Support The money I am hoping to raise will give me the initial personal start-up investment that funders are requiring me to have in order to get a business loan which is $5000. Now, of course the typical airbrush artist doesn't need an investment so huge that a loan is needed to get it started. However, I am not just trying to open a store...I am trying to provide something that will make a HUGE impact in the community that it will reside in.
The main goal is $30,000. This will provide the type of atmosphere that will attract all types of customers. It will provide the tools that our artist will need to be the most creative. It will provide the marketing materials needed to sell ourselves and promote our brand. 
The video was such a blessing to make because it even shows me how serious and focused I am on this project. 
  Other Ways You Can Help Thank you in advance for your financial contribution. This will be the first of many fundraising attempts to help me bring light to the vision that is Airbrush4Life. Please help be making a contribution and sharing this link on your Twitter page, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, and every other social outlet that you have including email. 
""I'm not sure what everyone else is doing with their passion...but as for me, I'm going to Airbrush4life!""

<p> </p>
<p>I'm Katy Barker. I'm on a quest to build a Tiny House. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Don't know what a Tiny House is?  Watch this short youtube video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJLSoUkh1Vs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJLSoUkh1Vs</a></p>
<p>(Please note that I am not buying a Tumbleweed House, nor am I purchasing their plans, nor am I affiliated with them in any way)</p>
<p>The video shows you an idea of what I will be building next summer, but mine will be different. More decorated, more home-like.  It will be a work of art in itself.</p>
<p>My house will be about 8'x16' and around 13' high. I do not have any architectural plans yet, but they’re in the works. I’ll be posting updates and info as I go.  </p>
<p>My Budget for this project is between $9,000 and $10,000. I’m currently saving money by living simply and ridding myself of monthly rent. If I’m frugal enough, I can save thousands of dollars by next summer. But will it be enough?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This is where you come in!</strong></p>
<p>I’m offering original, one of a kind, completely unique pieces of art for your hard-earned money!</p>
<p>Just think of the possibilities! Art that you can give to a loved-one or art that you can pin in your office to cheer you up! The more you give, the more you get!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here are the categories:</p>
<p><strong>Illustration:</strong> An impression, maybe colorful, maybe not, yet fully finished.</p>
<p><strong>Likeness:</strong> A graphite detailed work that is nearly close to photo-realistic. </p>
<p>The above realte toportraits, abstract, landscape, etc. in sizes: 2""x3"", 5""x8"", and 8""x10""</p>
<p><strong>Greeting Cards</strong>: Holidays, Birthdays, “hellos” – You pick which ones you get!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to raise $1,000, but truly, any little bit counts. If I make $100, that's a large amount of the 2x4's I'll need! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Living Tiny</strong></p>
<p>You might be asking, “Why?” Let me take a moment to explain.</p>
<p>Since graduating high school, I’ve spent years traveling around the country and living life. I enjoy the nomadic lifestyle and very much wish to continue on this path. But consistency is necessary. This is how the Tiny House fits into my lifestyle. It’s a house that I can take with me no matter where I end up.</p>
<p>It’s also about living simply. How many t-shirts do I have? Do I truly need to keep all of those paperbacks? What about these dish sets? It’s the difference between want and need.  The Tiny house Movement is about Mobility and Simplicity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Don’t have Extra Money to Spend?</strong></p>
<p>Neither do I! But if you’re super pumped about this project, there’s other ways you can help.</p>
<p>Donate lumber and materials, lend me your power tools or ladder. Any type of construction gear helps.</p>

If we love and accept ourselves more, we will be able to do the same for others. </p> </div> <div> <h3>The Necessities</h3> <p>These are the approximate costs of the supplies needed for my ArtPrize Seven entry, <a href=""https://www.artprize.org/megan-lacroix/2015/love-your-self"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Love Your Self</a>. The paintings are large for a big impact. The spectrum of colors with pops of metallic are to bring your spirits up and encourage an open expression of poisitivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>The canvas sizes are as follow: I need two 6' X 12' canvases and one 5' X 8' canvas. The cost of these canvases will be about $300 for bulk canvas and wood frames.</li>
<li>The large size and colorfulness of these paintings will require an extremely large amount of paint. The expected cost for the paint I need is about $700. </li> <li>All of my funders will recieve a hand crafted, one of a kind piece of jewelry from me. </li> <li>If I don't make the expected goal, not to worry! My entry will still shine bright but the funds go to constructing the canvas.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Love Your Self Motto</h3> <p>The reasons Love Your Self is so important to a bigger picture and a brighter world:</p> <ul> <li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">My artistic back ground has shown me every one is creative but it is your expression of your creativity that is most disregaurded. Through the study of Art &amp; Design, photogaphy, creative writing and working with all kinds people in different back grounds, I found understanding and appreciation of one self is the only way to self expression and a deeper love for yourself. <br/></span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We experience it all the time, coworkers or bosses who don't share your vision, one thing about yourself you can't seem to like, a great idea you just don't know if you can share, a burning desire to make something, the need to try something new, etc. Leave your doubts from other voices and about yourself behind. Step into acceptance of who you are, the one that grows every day to do better and find happiness. </span></li>
<li>Self love is the only way to open your mind, heart, body and soul to things outside of yourself. A greater appreciation of yourself will reflect a greater appeciation of your look outward. </li>
<li>We are given this life with so many beautiful ways to experience it. Our heightened senses and consciousness allows us to learn and understand more and more each day while advancing as a global community. Sharing life is one of its meanings. Think about how many tiny things we are made up of. When we stand strongly as our selves, we stand stronger when we are together. Think of every time you proved not only others wrong but yourself by accomplishing something you even for a moment doubted in your mind. Think about if we talked to each other instead of trying to bring outide force into our lives. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> In life comes the risk of setting a goal and not finishing it. The expectation of a calculated out come is more times than not optimism meeting narsisism or just plain selfish. I'd also call it math. The feeling of defeat is a big deterrant from  creativity and as artists of life we feel it all the time. I also feel that the same things can be said about math. We plug in the numbers and variables to get an answer. Some times we get two answers, some times we get it wrong, some times there is a specific order to it, some times there is more than one equation, the problem can always be solved though. With time and steady calculating we accomplish anything we really want to. It is a matter of doing it or not. Trying and trying again or not at all. Doing anything is a risk and puts us through challenge. We can do anything we put our minds to though. Just give it an honest try and remember that it takes practice and experience to become an expert. I won't ever give up. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p> <ul> <li>Please help me share the word. All I want to do is make art that brings at least some one a little more happiness. (even if it's only me, haha)</li> <li>Share this page on your social media. Like I always say, being nice comes at no cost to you. </li> </ul> </div> <p>I can't wait to meet you at ArtPrize Seven in Grand Rapids, MI at 25 Ottawa from September 23 - October 11, 2015. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Megan LaCroix</span><br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.Arsoncapital.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Arsoncapital.com</a></p><p>All Around Artist</p></div>","Love Your Self A series of three large scale paintings for ArtPrize Seven in 25 Ottawa downtown Grand Rapids, MI painted by yours truely, Megan LaCroix.

Stamps School of Art & Design at the University of Michigan, founder of Arson Capital Alternative Magazine and a creative specialist. I am a freelance artist looking to build my reputation through love and passion for all things creative and self expressive while spreading positivity and self love.  Your contributions fund my ArtPrize Seven paintings, help spread a positive message and help build a better artistic world.  Love Your Self is just one series of work aimed at a more self loving and accepting world. If we love and accept ourselves more, we will be able to do the same for others.    The Necessities These are the approximate costs of the supplies needed for my ArtPrize Seven entry, Love Your Self. The paintings are large for a big impact. The spectrum of colors with pops of metallic are to bring your spirits up and encourage an open expression of poisitivity.

The canvas sizes are as follow: I need two 6' X 12' canvases and one 5' X 8' canvas. The cost of these canvases will be about $300 for bulk canvas and wood frames.
The large size and colorfulness of these paintings will require an extremely large amount of paint. The expected cost for the paint I need is about $700.  All of my funders will recieve a hand crafted, one of a kind piece of jewelry from me.  If I don't make the expected goal, not to worry! My entry will still shine bright but the funds go to constructing the canvas.    The Love Your Self Motto The reasons Love Your Self is so important to a bigger picture and a brighter world:  My artistic back ground has shown me every one is creative but it is your expression of your creativity that is most disregaurded. Through the study of Art & Design, photogaphy, creative writing and working with all kinds people in different back grounds, I found understanding and appreciation of one self is the only way to self expression and a deeper love for yourself. 
We experience it all the time, coworkers or bosses who don't share your vision, one thing about yourself you can't seem to like, a great idea you just don't know if you can share, a burning desire to make something, the need to try something new, etc. Leave your doubts from other voices and about yourself behind. Step into acceptance of who you are, the one that grows every day to do better and find happiness. 
Self love is the only way to open your mind, heart, body and soul to things outside of yourself. A greater appreciation of yourself will reflect a greater appeciation of your look outward. 
We are given this life with so many beautiful ways to experience it. Our heightened senses and consciousness allows us to learn and understand more and more each day while advancing as a global community. Sharing life is one of its meanings. Think about how many tiny things we are made up of. When we stand strongly as our selves, we stand stronger when we are together. Think of every time you proved not only others wrong but yourself by accomplishing something you even for a moment doubted in your mind. Think about if we talked to each other instead of trying to bring outide force into our lives.     Risks & Challenges  In life comes the risk of setting a goal and not finishing it. The expectation of a calculated out come is more times than not optimism meeting narsisism or just plain selfish. I'd also call it math. The feeling of defeat is a big deterrant from  creativity and as artists of life we feel it all the time. I also feel that the same things can be said about math. We plug in the numbers and variables to get an answer. Some times we get two answers, some times we get it wrong, some times there is a specific order to it, some times there is more than one equation, the problem can always be solved though. With time and steady calculating we accomplish anything we really want to. It is a matter of doing it or not. Trying and trying again or not at all. Doing anything is a risk and puts us through challenge. We can do anything we put our minds to though. Just give it an honest try and remember that it takes practice and experience to become an expert. I won't ever give up.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Please help me share the word. All I want to do is make art that brings at least some one a little more happiness. (even if it's only me, haha) Share this page on your social media. Like I always say, being nice comes at no cost to you.    I can't wait to meet you at ArtPrize Seven in Grand Rapids, MI at 25 Ottawa from September 23 - October 11, 2015. Megan LaCroixwww.Arsoncapital.comAll Around Artist",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</h3>Hi There, <br/>My name is Baris Izgordu. I am a Graphic Designer who resides in New York and have a passion about soccer (a.k.a. football). Most of my passion for this beautiful game comes from my unconditional love for my favorite team Beşiktaş. Beşiktaş is a Turkish Sports club founded in 1903 and continues to be one of the biggest clubs in Turkey. The club is based in Istanbul, the biggest city in Turkey and also where I came from. I've been living abroad for more than 15 years. Besides my close family, Beşiktaş is the greatest thing in my life that I miss the most. To ease this feeling of homesickness a little bit, I've been collecting these shirts for the last decade or so.<br/><br/>Finally, I've decided to put them in a good use and for a real good cause. I've designed a book that portrays all of my collection as well as a few other fellow collectors' pieces. All of the benefits will be contributed to the charitable funds that benefits children in the United States and abroad. It will be a totally personal, not-for-profit project and hopefully will succeed with your generous help.<br/><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>At first, I need funds to have this project printed.

After an immense search for various printers across the globe, I have finally found one that will be the most beneficial for the campaign. The goal in this campaign will be the printing cost only. Hopefully this campaign will reach its goal and some of the books will already be sold through the perks that you see on the side of this page.

<i>Frontera </i>was designed with the intention of producing theory from experience. Three units comprehended a methodology that was built as an aesthetic statement regarding contemporary art practices within its relation to social sphere. The first one aimed to deal with the unavoidable dissolution of the present when dealing with public art interventions: the exchanges, the frictions, the encounters, the unexpected, the miscalculations, the awkwardness; all of them as non-transmitable moments ready to be reinvented trough mnemonic-ludic exercises. From there, we developed the other two units: the book and the documentary film. The book goes beyond a summarizing exercise regarding the experience in the streets of Frontera. It is a theoretical cartography that projects fiction as a true possibility for a reachable future. <p></p>
<br/><p><u>Frontera. THE BOOK</u></p>
<p><i>Frontera. A Sketch for the Creation of a Future Society</i>, is a bilingual edition (Spanish/English) with more tan 20 texts from authors such as Sven-Olav Wallenstein, Jan de Vos, Tarek Elhaik or Gisele Lisa Bonnici, who analyze, reflect and create theory out of artistic and curatorial practices in relation with the project.

<p><u>Frontera. THE DOCUMENTARY FILM;</u></p>
<p>The film puts into question the notion of truth in artistic documentation. If, for a long time, we had overpassed the objectivity in documentary film, when we look at the artistic scene, the documents appear to have still an authority over the work of art as a genuine proof of the artistic execution. Thus the documentary deals with the notion of montage, with the creation of an independent narrative that aims to distort the point of view of the artists, the curators and the people from the town whether as passive spectators or as active  participants. Hence, the film follows the agents on their divers intents to produce meaningful relations. </p>
<p>The film will be presented in different venues from 2014 onwards. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">(2014, 107 min)</span></p>

I have dedicated a lot of time over the last several years in studying with master artists in order to learn both theory and craft from them. Apprenticing in small studios, just as artists used to. For three years I've worked in the studio of a professional landscape painter, John Mac Kah, based in Asheville, NC. I've studied in the school of Ben Long IV, a master draftsman, oil and fresco painter trained in Italy. I've also been studying at Studio Escalier in France, learning figurative drawing and painting. They offer world-class methods passed down from a historical succession of painters.</div><div><br/></div><div>In order to really learn drawing and painting and obtain a great freedom of expression, it takes years of dedicated study, applying oneself every day. And the fruits that come from it are sweet!</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p>My current plan is to return to <a href=""http://studioescalier.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Studio Escalier</a> in Paris, France this May to study drawing for three weeks. A good friend of mine, the artist <a href=""http://www.mtobiashall.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Toby Hall</a> is teaching a figure drawing workshop there, and as soon as he told me, I went and signed up. The cost of an apartment in Paris for the month is somewhat outside of my budget, however, and I'm asking for your help in paying for it.

</div></div>","---Thanks for all the help guys, a bonus perk has been added, 9x12 archival print of this painting:Hello and welcome to my first IndieGoGo Campaign! I'm Jason Rafferty, a young recently full-time fine artist based in Asheville, NC. I have been drawing and painting most every day and sharing that work with folks for a bit over five years now! I want to bring a ton of beauty and inspiration into the world! Why not!""The Diplomat"", detail image. Charcoal on paper. Available as a print reward.
I have dedicated a lot of time over the last several years in studying with master artists in order to learn both theory and craft from them. Apprenticing in small studios, just as artists used to. For three years I've worked in the studio of a professional landscape painter, John Mac Kah, based in Asheville, NC. I've studied in the school of Ben Long IV, a master draftsman, oil and fresco painter trained in Italy. I've also been studying at Studio Escalier in France, learning figurative drawing and painting. They offer world-class methods passed down from a historical succession of painters.In order to really learn drawing and painting and obtain a great freedom of expression, it takes years of dedicated study, applying oneself every day. And the fruits that come from it are sweet!
My current plan is to return to Studio Escalier in Paris, France this May to study drawing for three weeks. A good friend of mine, the artist Toby Hall is teaching a figure drawing workshop there, and as soon as he told me, I went and signed up. The cost of an apartment in Paris for the month is somewhat outside of my budget, however, and I'm asking for your help in paying for it. I have found a place in Montmarte, a ten minute walk from the studio.

""Argenton Roses"", oil on belgian linen. Available as a print reward.


To express my gratitude for your generous support, I have a bunch of nice donor rewards available. Original artwork and prints! 
- Prints start at 25.00. You can see a selection of all available prints on my website here.
-Check out the drawings (120.00) and oil sketches (150.00) available as rewards here.
-I am also offering finished, framed paintings, check those out  here. (300.00 & 450.00)

""Torrents of the French Broad"", oil on canvas. Available as a print reward.


""Two Hummingbirds and Trumpet Vine"", oil on hand-prepared panel. Available as a print reward.

So please help me to go and study with Toby in Paris this May! You'll also help enable me to study Ancient, Renaissance and Baroque paintings and sculptures in the Louvre, and observe the color of Monet's ""Waterlilies"" cycle in the Musee de l'Orangerie. You'll be able to follow updates about it on the blog here.

</h3><p></p></div>","Introduction
Hello, my name is Aviel Ben Yamin. I'm an artist and producer from Portland, Oregon.


For the last 2 years I have been working with many talented writers, artists, and producers which has exposed me to many different genres and styles. From performing at sold out shows, to struggling with a period of major depression, these experiences have ultimately helped my production credibility, business relationships and most importantly my understanding of who I am and what I stand for. In addition to vast networking, I gained a lot of knowledge and insight on ""the ins and outs"" of the music business, as well as various techniques for recording and production mixing, which ultimately led to the final touches on my debut album ""Alone (Truthfully Told)."" After many long hours in the studio, sleepless nights, and my self diagnosis of OCD, the album is nearing completion. Though I am releasing it a  year from the initial release date, I am confident the wait is well worth it. Currently my team and I setting up marketing campaigns, music videos, distribution options, and tour planning. 


What We Need & What You Get

Right now we are looking to raise $7,000. This money will be split up three ways The Promotional Campaign - Drip marketing, Twitter and Youtube ads, as well as various other social media and press outlets. CD Duplication & Merchandise - The design of the album cover, physical copies of the album, and the design and production of #Loners T-shirts, hoodies and crewnecks. The Tour - This includes the rental of the Tour Bus, the services of our Booking Agency, Hotel, and Gas.

The national tour will begin Fall of 2015. My fan base has increased significantly across the U.S. and The Alone Tour will be an amazing way for me to connect with my supporters.There are incentive rewards based off any monetary donation. Ranging from a single digital download all the way to a private performance in your city. We are all extremely excited to see this project come to fruition and bring you the best music we can.
The Impact

I believe that the music I have been making has the influence to change the way that we as young people have been trained to think. I believe that we have been losing our morals and our beliefs have been twisted. I am hoping to change that, and to bring common sense back into hip hop music. 

I have seen how negatively society views hip hop, and especially in Portland, where almost every hip hop show is shut down by the police, just because they are uncomfortable with minorities getting together in groups. This is wrong, and it should not be the way that free expression is viewed. 
I believe that we can change this view.
Risks & Challenges

I will be the first to admit that running a successful tour campaign is extremely difficult, there are so many factors for success. With the help of my team I know that we have looked at the risks and have done our best to plan solutions to anything that could happen.

Planning
We have been lucky enough to network with an amazing group of promoters and venues across the country as well as booking agents from NovaTalent, who will be contracted to help plan this tour, with their professional help there should be no problems in booking and planning out the tour.
Ticket Sales
One of the biggest risks with any tour is not selling enough tickets. This is a problem we factored in towards the beginning of brainstorming potential issues for this tour. As I had mentioned above, a portion of the money funded will go into the marketing and promotion of this tour. With our expanding demographic of fans across the U.S and the support of our fans on social media, we believe that every show will sell out.

Other Ways You Can Help

We completely understand that while some of you may want to support, you are not in a position to contribute monetarily. If this is the case we would still love your support by sharing our project around, and continuing to spread the word about what we are trying to do. Word of mouth goes a long way. 
I just would like to thank you all for reading through all of this and I hope to see you on the tour.

<p></p>
<p>Zoetic was born out of the single idea of bringing the different aspects of the design world in one space. Yes we are fashion students and being a part of this industry we realised that fashion alone was upheld way more than other design forms. The design industry is brimming with creatives doing inspirational and cutting -edge work and not enough platforms exist which can showcase their work.</p>
<p>After a lot of research over the months, we decided to showcase the work of different creatives in such a manner which makes our readers question and think about the present and the future of the design industry. Because we want to start a movement with Zoetic and these questions from our readers will give us the momentum we need! The content has been decided to be spread across 4 sections :</p>
<p>Design &amp; Sex i.e <b>AGENDA</b> - A very eye raising category that this is, we aim to talk about what sex and gender means in a fashion driven society. </p>
<p>Design &amp; Psychology i.e <b>TONIC</b> - Delves into the psychological aspects of the fashion and design industry. </p>
<p>Design &amp; Sustainability i.e <b>STANCE</b> - Promoters of sustainability across all spectrums of life, Zoetic dedicates an entire section to people who believe in the same ethos.</p>
<p>Design &amp; Technology i.e <b>RADAR</b> - How design based categories are embracing technology and using it to giving us cutting edge products.</p>
<p> All our contributors (journalists included) are young creatives from all over the globe and we plan to curate more topics related to all the categories on our online space because the talent out there is inexhaustive and we plan to curate and showcase as much of it as possible.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
For four years, two young Guatemalan painters have been providing Saturday classes for up to 36 kids, a monthly food basket for the families and school supplies when the project has some ""extra"" money.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>From this Saturday class, we want to select young people who have sufficient talent and interest to go further - to learn to paint in oils.   This is a viable future occupation, as San Pedro la Laguna is a town on the tourist circuit, known for its artists.  This study is a dream of a lifetime for those kids who just love to draw and scribble, for those who view the extraordinary paintings of the teachers of the program and wish they could paint like that.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>These are children of the poor in San Pedro - of older men no longer able to gain sufficient living in the fields, of single moms who are mostly illiterate, who work selling fruit on the side of the street, or cleaning houses for others.  Several of our children have been abandoned by one or both parents, and live with aunts or grandmothers.  Many of the children have known the problems of family alcoholism.   We want these kids to hope for a future so they don't fall into the same patterns.  We believe that the time spent in the gallery, during class and especially during our proposed private classes, will be time in which our male teachers can provide a good model, and a support for these young kids.   We have already seen this in a few instances.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our basic Saturday class program is covered, as is the food basket for the moms, by the contributions of our madrinas and padrinas, mostly in the U.S., who contribute $24 monthly toward the program.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But we don't have funding to teach those kids who are more serious about painting.   We would like to pay our dedicated young teachers for the time they would give to teaching the young artists, and the time they spend promoting their work here in Guatemala. This is a dream of these young painters - to give to other kids what they once received - and of the children, who live to paint.  And what a pleasure it is as program staff watch each of these kids develop their own personal style.</div>

<p><i>Up the Witchpunx </i> documents a new current of subculture. Many of those in radical scenes are exploring witchcraft for the first time. Many witches are radicalizing for the first time, after years in more mainstream circles. Our project tries to create a safe space where these concerns can be discussed.</p>
<p>You can trust us. We have high personal accountability and good reputations in the communities we are a part of. our sincere hope is that after this campaign, we will be supported well enough that it can sustain itself for many years.</p>
<p><strong>Where the Money Goes!</strong></p>
<p>300 dollars will be used for printing.</p>
<p>100 dollars will be used to pay our contributors.</p>
<p>100 dollars will be used for shipping costs, promotional materials and other costs of production (such as art supplies and creation of perks.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are certainly challenges! This is a time when situations are unstable all over the world. That is why we are crafting a work of art and magick which is as relevant as possible to peoples everyday struggles.</p>
<p>This is a lot of work! We will need to strengthen our artistic capacities and expand our understanding of the tools we use. We will need to learn how to balance simplicity and complexity. We will need to communicate with our printer in a professional and effective manner. We will need to make rewards/perks that are simple but still heartfelt and beautiful.  We will need to continue developing strong time management skills. We must continue to embrace the mundane aspects of art and media, rather than just focusing on the glamorous parts. </p>
<p>That being said, all of this is very possible, and with your help we will meet and overcome all of these challenges!</p>
<h3><strong>Our Stretch Goals</strong></h3>
<p><strong>If we reach 600 dollars, we can...</strong></p>
<p>pay a larger sum to our contributors!</p>
<p><strong>If we reach 700 dollars we can...</strong></p>
<p>the above, plus print with color covers!</p>
<p><strong>if we reach 800 dollars we can...</strong></p>
<p> do all of the above, plus increase the quality of the perks, increase our print count, and print more stickers. ​</p>
<p><strong>if we reach $1000 or more?</strong></p>
<p>All of the above, plus an even bigger print count, and even more money we can share with our contributors! Our biggest dream is an art studio or office space so that we can make art and zines in a place other than our tiny studio apartment. What do you think?</p>
<p>Send us your suggestions at upthewitchpunx@riseup.net !</p>

<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If you are very low income, thats fine! Even a dollar helps, and gets you included in the 'thank you' section of the zine! If you cant give a dollar...</p>
<p>You can still spread the word! Talk about us! Share, reblog, like!</p>

Many witches are radicalizing for the first time, after years in more mainstream circles. Our project tries to create a safe space where these concerns can be discussed.
You can trust us. We have high personal accountability and good reputations in the communities we are a part of. our sincere hope is that after this campaign, we will be supported well enough that it can sustain itself for many years.
Where the Money Goes!
300 dollars will be used for printing.
100 dollars will be used to pay our contributors.
100 dollars will be used for shipping costs, promotional materials and other costs of production (such as art supplies and creation of perks.)

Risks & Challenges
There are certainly challenges! This is a time when situations are unstable all over the world. That is why we are crafting a work of art and magick which is as relevant as possible to peoples everyday struggles.
This is a lot of work! We will need to strengthen our artistic capacities and expand our understanding of the tools we use. We will need to learn how to balance simplicity and complexity. We will need to communicate with our printer in a professional and effective manner. We will need to make rewards/perks that are simple but still heartfelt and beautiful.  We will need to continue developing strong time management skills. We must continue to embrace the mundane aspects of art and media, rather than just focusing on the glamorous parts. 
That being said, all of this is very possible, and with your help we will meet and overcome all of these challenges!
Our Stretch Goals
If we reach 600 dollars, we can...
pay a larger sum to our contributors!
If we reach 700 dollars we can...
the above, plus print with color covers!
if we reach 800 dollars we can...
 do all of the above, plus increase the quality of the perks, increase our print count, and print more stickers. ​
if we reach $1000 or more?
All of the above, plus an even bigger print count, and even more money we can share with our contributors! Our biggest dream is an art studio or office space so that we can make art and zines in a place other than our tiny studio apartment. What do you think?
Send us your suggestions at upthewitchpunx@riseup.net !

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Studio Vine Glass is owned and operated by newly-engaged Claire Anderson and Steven Woodruff. We spent a number of years travelling around working in other glass manufacturing plants and artistic studios before we decided we very much wanted to have a studio of our own. We are both insanely passionate about what we do and care very deeply about glass, local manufacturing and the importance of small businesses to the economy.</p>
<p>We began Studio Vine Glass about two and a half years ago and have finally reached a point with our customer base that it was necessary to make the next step; go from renting time to operating our own glass blowing studio. About seven months ago we bought a small, abandoned mechanic shop in Niagara Falls and have spent all of this time gutting then renovating it into our studio space. It is a really uniquely challenging experience and has proven to be the largest project we have taken on together,....and we are SO CLOSE!</p>
<p>Everything is built and ready, orders are lined up, but we are waiting on permitting! Turns out it is particularly difficult to get all of the proper stickers when building a glass blowing studio, and is an insanely costly process. This is where we could sure use a bit of help. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $10,000 for this final stretch. All of it will go to subsidizing building costs; we still have to re-do our public bathroom (to code), re-build our storage space, pay for all of the appropriate inspectors to come through and cover the first couple months of operational costs while we get back on our feet and into a production routine. </p>
<p>We are selling all kinds of goodies, so it is easy for you to choose the donation amount you are most comfortable with. Our hand blown glass wares are for sale; primarily our infamous 'Old Fashions', but we also have decanters up for grabs, private workshops and classes and the largest donation means we will name our furnace after you!! (among other things)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is important to us because this is the life we are so passionate about. We are willing to move worlds if it means we can just keep blowing glass. In a larger sense, glassblowing has been around since the Roman times and is a tradition that is beautiful and challenging. It is a difficult skill to learn, but that is where the best lessons are learned. We feel very strongly about all trades and arts and the benefits they have on not only the maker's life but for humans in general and our ability to learn and specialize.</p>
<p>While we have never run a crowd funding campaign before, with our determination and all of the skills we have learned this past seven months, I have no doubt we will succeed. With essentially nothing, we started our company two years ago and have grown to selling all over Canada, showcasing in gallery exhibitions all over Ontario and growing our company to a point of re-investing in property and equipment. Support local economy and creative/ entrepreneurial talent!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are SO MANY RISKS involved with building a glass blowing studio. Especially in a time when the economy isn't great, and our trade has already been largely taken over by robots. Fuel and raw material costs are huge, our equipment is all specialized and pretty difficult to build or source, and navigating through all of the necessary safety systems and compiling proper combustion systems is one of the most confusing tasks I have ever participated in.</p>
<p>But, we want this so bad and have come up with all kinds of ways to cut costs elsewhere; recycle used materials, build our own tools and equipment, and create a sleek and contemporary line of functional blown glass wares. We chose the Niagara region to partner up with the food and wine scene, as well as piggy back onto the 'local and handcrafted' marketing.  We have also found that there is a large percentage of the population looking to support businesses like ours. It's the push-back to our current throw-away culture. Our customers are the ones that value quality over quantity and that want to spend their money in ways that make a positive impact.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate, that is ok with us! We sure understand what it is like to be a little financially tight (I mean, here we are heh heh). You can still help us by sharing this video with everyone you know! Post it somewhere, email it to all your friends and family, send it to your rich uncle's brother that owns that small island....you know, whatever.</p>

My paintings reflect my passion about the ocean as well as my concerns about climate change, habitat loss, pollution and overfishing. With my work, I support local environmental organizations engaged in ocean advocacy.</p>
<p>I'm creating a full-colour 12-month eco-calendar of my ocean paintings that will be printed locally on environmentally-friendly paper. Each month will feature a different 8 x 10 image, as well as important ocean-related dates and resources. Your contribution will help cover the initial printing costs for the calendar. Raising more money would allow me to enhance the design and print a larger run. I'll sell the calendars through my studio, my website, at events, and through selected retailers. A portion of the proceeds from sales will benefit environmental organizations working to protect the BC coast from oil tankers.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<p>The calendar will be a full colour, 12-month wall calendar, with each month featuring an 8"" x 10"" image of one of my paintings. It will be printed locally in Vancouver on environmentally-friendly paper (FSC 100% post-consumer). Because of the great relationship I have with my commercial printer, I'm able to print a short run of calendars at a unit cost that is usually only available to businesses printing 5000 or more pieces. The initial $1500 raised will cover a print run of 200 calendars. (More money = more calendars, less money = fewer calendars.)</p>

I HAVE MADE THIS MY LIFE'S WORK AND PASSION TO<br/>DOCUMENT THESE MUSICIANS TO PRESERVE THEIR HISTORY AND CONTRIBUTION. I DEPICT THEIR LIVES ON CANVAS FROM YOUTH, TILL END OF LIFE. THEY ARE MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY, AND I KNOW MANY OF THEM PERSONALLY."" ~BRUNI</strong></span></p>
<p><span></span> </p>
<p><span><strong>BRUNI BIOGRAPHY: </strong></span></p>
<span><p>The Jazz Masters Series by BRUNI' is an explosive experience of color and<br/>soul, an emotional body of work that now numbers over 1,400 original canvases of Jazz greats. <span>Her wildly expressionistic brush captures the very depths of their spirit. One of BRUNI's Duke Ellington Portraits is in the </span>permanent collection of The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Regarded by many as “The greatest living portrait painter”, this highly acclaimed Artist has paintings in the permanent collections of these Museums:</p></span><p><span><b>MUSEUMS: <br/></b><b>-The Smithsonian Institution </b>in Washington D.C.</span><span><br/><b>-Universal Studios: The Downbeat Jazz Hall of Fame Museum </b>in Orlando, Florida <b>-Kansas City Jazz Museum: 18th &amp; Vine Authority </b>in Kansas City, Missouri <b>-The Putnam Museum – Bix Beiderbecke Hall </b>in Davenport, Iowa<br/><b>-The Los Gatos Historical Museum </b>in Los Gatos, California</span></p>
<p><b>EDUCATION:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Figure drawing and painting studies at Villa Montalvo and the University of Mexico<br/></strong></li>
<li><strong>Private color studies with Grumbacher Color Award winner Michael Linstrom<br/></strong></li>
<li><strong>20 years of owning and running her own Gallery, privately conducting intensive life drawing classes with live models. Teaching and leading workshops and lectures throughout the Bay Area.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>BRUNI’s work has recently entered the “Collectors Market”, after an exhibit in New York City, which also included Franz Kline, Jean Dufy, and Miles Davis, as part of The Definitive Jazz Auction. Her work has been published worldwide in many forms: Lithographs, CD covers, Feature magazine articles, posters and more. As a testament to her profound ability to “Capture the essence; that which is intangible”, many of the greatest Musicians in history are fans and collectors: the late Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Carmen McRae, Roberta Flack, Jazz critic Leonard Feather, and numerous others. <br/>You may view BRUNI’s work daily at her own BRUNI Gallery in Northern<br/>California. 1171 Lincoln Ave. San Jose, CA. 95125</p></span><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
<p>BRUNI needs $50,000 to keep the Jazz Master Series by BRUNI going. This only covers just the cost of canvases, paints, towels, easels, frames, ALL painting supplies, sketch books, cost of rent, and electricity for just one year. The cost to keep going is actually so much more, but we feel this would at least give BRUNI some much needed help. </p>
<ul>
<li>Fortunately, BRUNI has a rich body of work that has already been built through the years. The PERKS she will give are fantastic! </li>
<li>IF she does not reach her goal of $50,000, the money donated will still go to all that is listed above. Know that you are giving to a very worthy cause. We must help and support our 'artist treasures' while we have them here, not only after they have gone. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong> (Here is a personally written letter by BRUNI, sharing her feelings about the 'Impact' this will have.)</p>
<p><b>""This campaign is important to me because the art work I do for Jazz has to continue. I have not painted all the musicians that need to be painted, and I feel that they should all be represented by great portraits. </b><b>By your contributions,<br/>it will help me to continue this important, educative work because since it is<br/>of an educational nature, it is not easy to sell. I am not a non-profit. You<br/>will be helping to keep jazz, which is America's truly original art form alive<br/>through my portraits.<span>  I have spent 22 years going to live gigs, drawing the musicians in sketch books as they played.  I have studied and researched<br/>all of their lives, and when kids and local students come into my<br/>""gallery"" they learn who these great people are/were by gazing at<br/>their portraits, and learning about them.

I HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE VISUAL BIOGRAPHY OF JAZZ IN PORTRAITURE FORM FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE JAZZ IS AMERICA'S CLASSICAL MUSIC. I HAVE MADE THIS MY LIFE'S WORK AND PASSION TODOCUMENT THESE MUSICIANS TO PRESERVE THEIR HISTORY AND CONTRIBUTION. I DEPICT THEIR LIVES ON CANVAS FROM YOUTH, TILL END OF LIFE. THEY ARE MY FRIENDS AND MY FAMILY, AND I KNOW MANY OF THEM PERSONALLY."" ~BRUNI
 
BRUNI BIOGRAPHY: 
The Jazz Masters Series by BRUNI' is an explosive experience of color andsoul, an emotional body of work that now numbers over 1,400 original canvases of Jazz greats. Her wildly expressionistic brush captures the very depths of their spirit. One of BRUNI's Duke Ellington Portraits is in the permanent collection of The Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
Regarded by many as “The greatest living portrait painter”, this highly acclaimed Artist has paintings in the permanent collections of these Museums:MUSEUMS: -The Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C.-Universal Studios: The Downbeat Jazz Hall of Fame Museum in Orlando, Florida -Kansas City Jazz Museum: 18th & Vine Authority in Kansas City, Missouri -The Putnam Museum – Bix Beiderbecke Hall in Davenport, Iowa-The Los Gatos Historical Museum in Los Gatos, California
EDUCATION:

Figure drawing and painting studies at Villa Montalvo and the University of Mexico
Private color studies with Grumbacher Color Award winner Michael Linstrom
20 years of owning and running her own Gallery, privately conducting intensive life drawing classes with live models. Teaching and leading workshops and lectures throughout the Bay Area.

BRUNI’s work has recently entered the “Collectors Market”, after an exhibit in New York City, which also included Franz Kline, Jean Dufy, and Miles Davis, as part of The Definitive Jazz Auction. Her work has been published worldwide in many forms: Lithographs, CD covers, Feature magazine articles, posters and more. As a testament to her profound ability to “Capture the essence; that which is intangible”, many of the greatest Musicians in history are fans and collectors: the late Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Carmen McRae, Roberta Flack, Jazz critic Leonard Feather, and numerous others. You may view BRUNI’s work daily at her own BRUNI Gallery in NorthernCalifornia. 1171 Lincoln Ave. San Jose, CA. 95125What We Need & What You Get:
BRUNI needs $50,000 to keep the Jazz Master Series by BRUNI going. This only covers just the cost of canvases, paints, towels, easels, frames, ALL painting supplies, sketch books, cost of rent, and electricity for just one year. The cost to keep going is actually so much more, but we feel this would at least give BRUNI some much needed help. 

Fortunately, BRUNI has a rich body of work that has already been built through the years. The PERKS she will give are fantastic! 
IF she does not reach her goal of $50,000, the money donated will still go to all that is listed above. Know that you are giving to a very worthy cause. We must help and support our 'artist treasures' while we have them here, not only after they have gone. 

The Impact: (Here is a personally written letter by BRUNI, sharing her feelings about the 'Impact' this will have.)
""This campaign is important to me because the art work I do for Jazz has to continue. I have not painted all the musicians that need to be painted, and I feel that they should all be represented by great portraits. By your contributions,it will help me to continue this important, educative work because since it isof an educational nature, it is not easy to sell. I am not a non-profit. Youwill be helping to keep jazz, which is America's truly original art form alivethrough my portraits.  I have spent 22 years going to live gigs, drawing the musicians in sketch books as they played.  I have studied and researchedall of their lives, and when kids and local students come into my""gallery"" they learn who these great people are/were by gazing attheir portraits, and learning about them. That is priceless. I often talk tothem personally and hopefully have helped them in some inspirational way.
I feel that I need at least $50,000 to keep on going. These funds go specifically toward materials, studio maintenance, which includes rent, utilities, phones, display space for showing, assistants which allow me the freedom to paint in peace, research, time involved and freedom to paint the Jazz Series without interruptions from other work.
My unique perks are:Signed 5""x7"" reproductions, signed limited edition lithographs, andeven original sketches in pen and ink and more.
The funds will enable the 'Series' to continue whether I reach my goal or not, they will go toward materials, canvases, brushes, lights, studio, so that I may continue on my path.
My project is valuable to the contributor and to the world because there is no other artist of my caliber painting  these American Icons. I'll make it real by stating that without this Series the future generations will NOT KNOW WHO LOUIS ARMSTRONG, OR MILES DAVIS, OR MARY LOU WILLIAMS AND COUNTLESS OTHERS WERE. JAZZ WILL BE A FORGOTTEN PHOTOGRAPH BOOK IN A DEAD LIBRARY.
FINALLY FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT CONTRIBUTE YOU CAN STILL HELP BY GETTING THE WORD OUT, AND MAKING NOISE ABOUT BRUNI'S MASTERPIECES!!!  AND MAKE SURE TO USE THE INDIEGOGO SHARE TOOLS!

<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>I started Brooklyn Birdhouse to bring more birdhouses to nesting birds and to create objects inspired by birdhouses. Birdhouses are the perfect combination of my three passions: designing, building, and art-making. Brooklyn Birdhouses are designed and built by me. Each piece of wood is individually cut, drilled, and painted. Care is put into each birdhouse. My Instagram @bklynbirdhouse features some my functional and decorative pieces.</p>
<p>For the past 10 years, I ran my own successful small business--an art studio for children from 18m-grade 5 in Brooklyn, NY. It was a wonderful experience, and was difficult to make the decision to close. I loved being part of something bigger than me, creating with young students and bringing art to the neighborhood. But it was time to change things up. Bert from Mary Poppins said it best: “Winds in the east, there’s a mist coming in, like something is brewin’ and ’bout to begin.” After planning for many months, I created Brooklyn Birdhouse.  </p>
<p>I am crowdfunding to build the business. With funding, I will be able to acquire necessary saws and tools, build out my workshop (it’s micro!), develop a website/online store, and create digital/print materials. It would be amazing to go beyond the fundraising goal to create more designs for different birds (bluebirds, owls, and more) and home decor.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'>I plan to have the business up and running this spring, at which time I will end crowdsourcing and begin selling online and in brick and mortar shops. I welcome any leads or recommendations of shops that may be interested in carrying Brooklyn Birdhouse.</span></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Functional Birdhouses</h3>
<p>I created three functional birdhouse (nest box) designs after months of researching, designing, tweaking, prototyping, and redesigning. These nest boxes are for use outdoors specifically for <u>chickadees</u> and <u>wrens</u>. You may also prefer to keep them indoors as a decorative element in your home. There is door for hiding treasure!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546959270/drcrwappvjdfpxplmqjc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Functional birdhouses are designed with the bird’s needs in mind and they feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predator guard to deter little mammal arms</li>
<li>Ventilation to reduce overheating</li>
<li>Drainage to keep interior dry, prevent hypothermia</li>
<li>Access panel (with latch) for clean out and inspections</li>
<li>No perch to deter bird predators</li>
<li>Overhang and slanted roof to shed water and keep inside dry</li>
<li>Recessed floors to prevent water seepage</li>
<li>Ladder for fledglings to climb and exit the nest box</li>
<li>Appropriately sized entrance hole for intended species</li>
<li>Thoughtful materials: low VOC paints, weather-resistant cedar, non-toxic glues</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Decorative Birdhouses</h3>
<p>Decorative birdhouses are for indoor use or outdoors if they are sheltered from the elements. There is no space for an actual bird to nest. Detail is put in to every birdhouse: selection of birdhouse body, roof angle and design, perch choice, and proportion of house to base. Each piece is a unique work of art, using natural materials and vintage hardware.  </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Birdhouse Mirror</h3>
<p>The Birdhouse Mirror is a decorative and functional piece with a mirror in place of the entrance. This birdhouse is also handmade and has a shingled roof and natural branch perch, providing a unique decoration for your home. The Birdhouse Mirror is 12-3/8"" tall, 9-5/8"" wide, 1-7/8"" deep and is ready to hang.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>Birdhouses on the market today are either unsafe for birds or a tad on the plain side. I wanted to design birdhouses which are both super cute and functional. In addition, each of the three functional designs are available in four different accent colors, allowing for more personalization. </p>
<p>My decorative birdhouses are thoughtfully ""green."" They give new life to driftwood and downed trees and branches. I also source vintage hardware, to give a new appreciation to old metal findings.</p>
<p>The Birdhouse Mirror gives humans a fun and functional element for your home. It brings the birdhouse inside for you to enjoy. I hope to add more to this collection in the future.</p>

A beloved Husband, Dad, Son and Grandfather, and an artist that poured his soul into his creations. His death was sudden and tragic, and has affected so many people. Often beauty and tragedy are intertwined. We are still reeling from his passing, but we feel him with us and all around us. His will live on through his wife Laurel, his seven children, four grandchildren and the scores of people that he touched. His last art piece ""Transcendence"" will continue to inspire the art spirit in others, and his incredible body of sculptural works will impact and move people for generations to come. <p>We are grieving as a family, but we will honor your contributions to our campaign, and send the perks when we find some order amongst this tragic chaos. Please be patient with us. If you prefer a refund for your contribution, please let us know. If you do not wish to receive a perk, but would like to contribute to assist our family during this difficult time, we sincerely appreciate that as well. </p>
<p>We will be casting Steven's last incredible art piece ""Transcendence"" in the near future through a new campaign that will share his art legacy with the world. If you wish to be notified of this in the future, please send an email with your information to <a href=""mailto:webforms@artbyknight.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">webforms@artbyknight.com</a>. </p>
<p>My dad's dream was to share his art with the world, bring beauty into life and help inspire others to live their art spirit. Please help us honor him by living your art spirit and embracing life and love to the fullest. Thank you. ~Tawnya Knight</p>

of sculptural work. He is also a dad and grandpa, an avid
outdoors-man, and loves his quiet time to reflect on the beauty of the

</span></span></span></span></span></div>","Last Friday 09/27/13 Steven Knight passed from this earthly world. A beloved Husband, Dad, Son and Grandfather, and an artist that poured his soul into his creations. His death was sudden and tragic, and has affected so many people. Often beauty and tragedy are intertwined. We are still reeling from his passing, but we feel him with us and all around us. His will live on through his wife Laurel, his seven children, four grandchildren and the scores of people that he touched. His last art piece ""Transcendence"" will continue to inspire the art spirit in others, and his incredible body of sculptural works will impact and move people for generations to come. We are grieving as a family, but we will honor your contributions to our campaign, and send the perks when we find some order amongst this tragic chaos. Please be patient with us. If you prefer a refund for your contribution, please let us know. If you do not wish to receive a perk, but would like to contribute to assist our family during this difficult time, we sincerely appreciate that as well. 
We will be casting Steven's last incredible art piece ""Transcendence"" in the near future through a new campaign that will share his art legacy with the world. If you wish to be notified of this in the future, please send an email with your information to webforms@artbyknight.com. 
My dad's dream was to share his art with the world, bring beauty into life and help inspire others to live their art spirit. Please help us honor him by living your art spirit and embracing life and love to the fullest. Thank you. ~Tawnya Knight

  WHAT IS IT ABOUT?
""I Have the Art Spirit"" was created by a family and team of artists; husband, wife and daughter.  We have combined our artistic passions of sculpture, painting and music, all with a common theme of  “I Have the Art Spirit”. We are here to start a MOVEMENT...a world wide Art Spirit movement....and it begins, with you! We want to Inspire everyone to recognize their unique gifts.We wish for every human being to Embrace their own creative energy, and those of others.And we encourage each and every one of you that are still searching for your purpose, to find and Awaken your art spirit!We are humbly inviting you to be a part of this Universal Movement.  
     WHY WE NEED YOU!
Our goal is to accomplish a life-long dream of being able to get our art directly to you -- those who embrace the Art Spirit. Through Indiegogo we can finally reach out to all of you around the world! Our journeys haven't always been focused on living our Art Spirit, as many of you can likely identify with. With this campaign, we have now laid it on the line and we are pursuing what we were born to do! But we need your help to go forward.  Your generous contributions will help the Art Spirit Movement to gain traction and provide us with the ability to continue to create meaningful art that anyone can own and enjoy.  You will also be instrumental in establishing IHaveTheArtSpirit.com.  The website will be born of this campaign, and will create the platform for people anywhere, to share, support and embrace their creativity.



MEET THE ARTISTS!




(Click names to view the individual videos for each artist's creation)


Steven L. Knight is an accomplished classical, figurative realist sculptor.
He has lived a very colorful and diversified life. Steven grew up in
a rural environment, spending years in the beauty of nature,
surrounded by incredible wildlife and majestic horses. His connection
to this special period in his life is evident in his extensive body
of sculptural work. He is also a dad and grandpa, an avid
outdoors-man, and loves his quiet time to reflect on the beauty of the
world. Steven has shown in major galleries, has his line of relief
bronze belt buckles circulating the world, and is now continuing his
journey with “I Have the Art Spirit”.


Laurel Knight is a dynamic and passionate individual. She is a voracious
reader, always hungry for knowledge or a new experience. Laurel takes
pleasure in the little things, from the laughter of a young child, or
the enjoyable antics of a mischievous squirrel, to the light breeze
on a sunny summer day. She has built quite a diverse body of works,
which were inspired by her many years as a mother and grandmother, as
well as her love for the old masters and the great outdoors. Now that
all of her children are grown, Laurel has finally turned her full
creative energy to her oil painting, and is fully expressing her
artistry through this campaign.

Tawnya Knight is a person of many interests as well as the Creative Director
at Art by Knight.  She grew up singing & performing in live
musicals, and eventually turned toward the art of sales.  She has
since returned to her first love of music and art, and is able to
express her passion through “I Have the Art Spirit”. Tawnya spent
happy years growing up in the wild beauty of Montana, and after 11
years in Southern California, has found her heart in sunny Central
Oregon. Tawnya spends her time with her family at Art by Knight;
directing social media and creative aspects of the business, writing
poetry, working on music, and making hand-crafted jewelry.

________________________________________________________Original Song “I Will” by Tawnya Knight

Tawnya Knight has written an original song titled ""I Will"".  This song represents what lifts you when you are in your darkest hours.  It is clean, classic and genre-less.  It is still to be mastered in the recording studio, so please watch the project video below, to hear a few samples of the song.  ""I Will"", is to be released in three (3) versions.  The original piano version, a ""folksier"" acoustic version, and a ""full band"" version with piano, perhaps a violin and more!  Tawnya will master each of these versions in the recording studio to bring you the very best quality available.  You can see the lyrics at this link: ""I Will"" Lyrics


Tawnya has had experience working with some very talented musicians in the past. Please sample some of these awesome songs by ""Palace View"", vocals by Tawnya Knight, written by Graeme Dickson (also on guitar, bass and drums) and accompanied on keyboard by Brian Dickson. 
Sorrow Hole     Tawnya Knight on vocals
Without You     Tawnya Knight on vocals
Unforsaken      Tawnya Knight on vocals
Pieces Without Me      Tawnya Knight on vocals

The fabulous piano in the song, ""I Will"", is written and played by the incredible Dave Finch. He will be the ""Piano Man"" for two versions of the song, and he is playing the piano background in the videos.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
THE YARDS collaborative art space, located in the heart of Rochester's beloved Public Market, seeks to attract and unify people from all parts of the community through art installations and exhibitions, inspired dinners, performances, mural projects, readings, and education. We are a transformative and flexible space meant to serve as a centralization of local artistic power and collaboration.<br/><br/>We are committed to making art accessible to a greater audience by not staying confined within the walls of the “Gallery” space. We aim to promote art as living and ever changing as it continues to take shape reflecting the talents of the people participating. Our intention is to also extend our network to still further reaches and communities, while making Rochester a more interesting place to live.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help in raising enough money to keep The Yards going. The Yards is a noncommercial art space. The ideas we have aren't necessarily generating money, but they are allowing people opportunities who wouldn't have the chance or the resources to have a show at a traditional gallery. Our goal is to keep with our pursuit of providing exciting, nontraditional events to the Rochester community. Your contributions will help us keep this space opening by helping us in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our most basic need is help paying the rent and literally keeping the roof over our head!</li>
<li>Hosting events requires a lot more panache that simply rent! (check out the gallery to see some of our events) Your donations will help us cover the basics of running a space where people come to enjoy art, food, dancing, and mingling (dishes, cleaning supplies, paint, spackle, toilet paper, etc.)</li>
<li>Every dollar counts! We really want to reach our goal of $7,000, but every penny we get will go towards keeping The Yards running and bringing you the collaborative events Rochester loves.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>And what do you get if you help reach our goal? You get tons of fun, Yards related perks to use to enjoy this amazing space. Help us keep The Yards alive and going strong for another year!</p>

To help foster an economy which financially supports the arts by creating more paid opportunities for artists.
Celebrate and promote Olde Towne East's rich artistic heritage.
Promote the work of contemporary artists living in our neighborhood.
Our Mural ProjectThe Olde Towne Arts Association will be creating a mural reproduction on Oak Street of the renowned painting Riverfront No.1 by George Wesley Bellows because:
Bellows was a resident of Olde Towne East. 
He is recognized as an American Realist painter of great significance. The Columbus Museum of Art calls him "" the most acclaimed American artist of his generation"".
There currently are no murals in Columbus celebrating his work.
Riverfront no.1 is housed in the Columbus Museum of Art
This painting is a good choice for a mural because it is bright in color and dynamic.
It's subject is people at leisure gathered around the ""urban equivalent of 'the old swimming hole'"".
The Impact
Economic Value - Oak St is a vibrant corridor of our neighborhood and we believe a mural will increase visibility and revenue for the wonderful businesses in this area such as The Olde Towne Tavern, Angry Baker, L'Appat Patissierie and Yellow Brick Pizza. This mural will also create a paid opportunity for an artist who is living and working in our area.
Aesthetic Value - This mural will beautify the area and make it more pleasant place to live and visit.
Positive PR - The creation of this mural will draw positive news coverage to Olde Towne East.

<h3 align=""left"">■ <strong>Aim of the Project</strong>
</h3>
<p align=""left"">This is a <strong>trans-continental fieldwork project</strong> by a Berlin based independent curator Shinya Watanabe. This trip aims <strong>to verify that Europe and Asia is one continental culture</strong>, and to do so, <strong>I will travel from Berlin to Japan by land, without using an airplane</strong>. I would like to raise the cost of this fieldwork, and would like to <strong>share both the processes and the outcome of the fieldwork with supporters</strong>.</p>
<h3 align=""left"">
<strong>■ Why do I</strong><strong> want to realize this project?</strong>
</h3>
<p align=""left"">While living in New York City for 7 years and had traveled 43 countries mainly in Europe and Asia as a back-packer, I have continued my research on art history.</p>
<p align=""left"">In the process, I realized that what is so called<strong> “Europe” and “Asia”, or “West” and “East” is mere an imaginary division</strong>, and found that <strong>both of them shares the same roots</strong>, and had been developed by influencing each other.</p>

<p align=""left"">To think like that, I have been influenced by <strong>German Artist Joseph Beuys and Korean artist Nam June Paik’s life long collaborative art project called “Eur-Asia”</strong>. Through this project, they tried to unite Europe in its west and Asia in its east as <strong>one continental culture of “Eur-Asia”</strong>.</p>
<p align=""left"">On the background of their artistic activities of ""Eur-Asia"", there are <strong>severe World War II experience</strong>, and the subsequent <strong>divide of east-west Germamany and north-south Korea</strong>. To overcome these divides, such as ideogogy and the states which could be also the cause of war, they declear <strong>the ideal – the unity of Europe and Asia as “Eur-Asia”</strong>.</p>
<p align=""left""><img alt=""Joseph Beuys, Fat Chair and Felt Suit"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BLQWybQCEAAUeZy.jpg:large"" src="""" style="""" title=""Joseph Beuys, Fat Chair and Felt Suit""/></p>
<p>When 22 years old <strong>Joseph Beuys</strong> piloting Germany Air Force bomber, <strong>his airplane  crashed in Crimea, Ukraine</strong>. He says that local Tatars warmed up injured Beuys’s body with fat and felt, therefore he could save his life. Later he used these materials for his scuptural artwork, and his concept of ""<em><strong>social sculpture</strong></em>"" lead him to be the founding member of the <strong>German Green Party</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt=""Nam June Paik"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://knifefight.typepad.com/my_weblog/images/njp_rip.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Nam June Paik""/></p>
<p>Born 1932 in Korea under Japanese occupation, <strong>Nam June Paik</strong> became an exile in Japan due to the outbreak of Korean War, together with his family who supported Japanese occupation military. After graduating University of Tokyo, he started his artistic activity in West Germany and later in the States. Known as the <strong>father of video art</strong>, Paik also created the ""<strong>Electronic Superhighway</strong>"", the prototype of the Internet in 1974, which later had been established during Bill Clinton’s administration. Moreover, his <strong>satellite art project connected Western world and Eastern world in real time</strong>.</p>

<p>Both Beuys and Paik frequently used Genghis Khan as a motif of the work. <strong>The origin of Criream Tatars goes back to the Mongol invasion of Rus</strong>', and Paik considered that the <strong>root of Korean culture goes back to Scythian who had traffic to Siberia</strong>, before the Han Dynasty. At the first Venice Biennale after the reunification of Germany in 1993, <strong>Paik represented German National Pavilion as a foreigner, the first time in the world</strong>.  Having aware of the misunderstanding and the fear toward the East in Europe, Paik created the video sculpture  ""<em><strong>Rehabilitation of Genghis Khan</strong></em>,"" riding on old Korean bicycle, for the recovery of his reputation in the Western world.</p>
<p><img alt=""Joseph Beuys and Dalai Lama"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://wdw-nl.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Beuys_DalaiLama1-e1358763719152.jpg?a36242"" src="""" style="""" title=""Joseph Beuys and Dalai Lama""/></p>
<p><strong>Joseph Beuys tried to invite Dalai Lama to Documenta 7</strong>, the largest art festival in Europe, and tried to collaborate his social sculpture “<em><strong>7000 Oaks</strong></em>”. Beuys’s intention could not be successful, but after the death of Beuys, the <strong>Dalai Lama purchased seven oaks</strong>, to commemorating their permanent cooperation. As a memorial to Beuys, <strong>Paik travelled to Irukutk in Siberia</strong>, the city built by Japanese prisoners of war who were taken by the Soviet army, and made a video art work.</p>
<p>I became confident that <strong>the concept of the East and the West is mere imaginary existence</strong>, and both have been developed by influencing each other. However, <strong>I feel a need to know how the continuity of language, religious and musical connection exist in Eurasian “Steppe Road”</strong>.  Therefore <strong>I decided to cross the Eurasian continent by land</strong>, by spending 10 week, from mid July to the end of September.</p>
<p align=""left""><img alt=""Eurasia Visiting Cities"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BLQNxtxCMAAGChZ.jpg:large"" src="""" style="""" title=""Eurasia Visiting Cities""/></p>
<p align=""left"">First, I depart Berlin, and <strong>go to Crimean Peninsula</strong> of Ukraine where <strong>Joseph Beuys’s bomber crashed</strong>, and will do a research with local Tatars whether the treatment using fat had actually existed or not. Then visit some <strong>Silk Road cities including Samarkand</strong>, and go to <strong>Irkutsk via Siberia</strong>, and there I will offer flowers to the Japanese prisoners who passed away. Then continue <strong>“Steppe Road” of Siberia to east through Mongolia and China</strong>, and then goes to <strong>Korean Peninsula</strong> by ferry, and visit the <strong>Nam June Paik Art Center in Seoul</strong>. Then I will go back to my home country Japan by ferry.</p>
<p align=""left"">Based on this field work, <strong>I will complete my doctoral thesis on “<em>Eur-Asia</em>”</strong>, which proves that Eurasia is a one continental culture as Beuys and Paik suggested, at the University of the Arts in Berlin. Moreover, based on this thesis, <strong>I would like to curate the exhibition “Eur-Asia” with their artworks,  and would like to make it travel from Germany, Korea and Japan to realize their dream.</strong></p>

<p align=""left"">Isn’t it a cause of war, that all of us living on the same earth do not know each other, and considering others as completely different thing, which cause any suspision or hostility? Don’t you think that we can abolish the war, if we could consider other people or cultures which you had thought completely different is actually connected to your own?</p>
<p align=""left"">Now we are facing the end of modernity, and even experiencing the shift of civilization. I believe that the outcome of this field work will be the great common assets of humankind, and will illuminate our future after the end of modernity.</p>

<em>""Searching for Eur-Asia"" Video Project:</em><br/><em>Homage to Chris Marker </em>
</h2>
</li>
</ul><p><em>Hello everybody! This is Shinya Watanabe. Today, I would like to offer you the additional perks.</em></p>
<p><em>In the process of this field work, I would like to make a video work. As a motivation to do so, there is a meeting and farewell with a film maker, Chris Marker.</em><br/><br/><em> I love movie, and when I was in a college, I was a member of the cinema research club. When I was 20-year-old, I left for a journey of visiting seven countries in Asia as a back-packer, and want to make a short movie.</em><br/><br/><em> This is a story in the Jungle Train, a train crossing the jungle from Singapole to Malaysia. An old man sat next to me, and he kindly told me about the customs and language of Malaysia for three hours. When the train approached the destination and started to slow down, the old man says, ""I have a song which I would like to sing for you"", and swinging his right arm, he began to sing, such as ""hakkou ichiuno"". I was surprised, but I could intuitively tell that it is Japanese military’s war song, which had been forced to local people under imperial policy of Japan.</em><br/><br/><em> Afte singing this short phrase, this old man collapsed on the spot. So I asked, "" Could you tell me the story a little bit more?"", then he got off the train with me. Then he told me that the language policy of the Japanese army was throughgoing, and the Malaysian people who experienced it and now become old put that memory deep into their own hearts.</em></p>
<p><em>I was moved, and said, ""it is not possible that I can do something for  you here, but I will tell this story to young Japanese people for sure."" He cried, and squeezed my hand strongly.</em><br/><br/><em> To achieve the promise of this old man, as soon as I return to Japan, I started to stay my senior friend’s house, and start the video editing. I already had a plan ahead to study abroad to the United States within a month. Unfortunately, because of the technical problem, I could not complete the film editing in the end.</em><br/><br/><em> To encourage me, my senior frined invited me to the film screening of ""Level Five"" directed by Chris Marker. The theme of the film is based on the memory of the Battle of Okinawa. In the collective self-determination of Okinawa, Mr. Kinjo who became priest was asked, why did you kill your own family member, and he answers, because I loved them. Then the narrator asks “what is love?”, and the film continues. Then I realized that it is impossible to make a better film than what Chris Marker had made, and I should be on the side to introduce great works, and decided to be a curator, and left to America.</em></p>
<p><em>After I became a curator, I curated an exhibition on the theme of post-war art under Japan’s peace constitution, and I made this exhibition travelled from NY to Tokyo and Okinawa.  On that occation, by all means, I thought I should realize the screening of Chris Marker’s “Level Five” on the theme of collective self-determination of Tokashiki Island, in Okinawa Prefecture.</em></p>
<p><em>To screen this movie in Okinawa was difficult, but I realized it, and made it success. I sent a news of film screening’s success to Chris Marker, together with the photos of the screening, and Marker was happy, and digitally edit the photo and send back to me. It became my treasure.</em><br/><br/><em> I have always paid respect to Chris Marker. When I curated the charity exhibition for Tohoku Eartuquake orphans in Switzerland, I quoted the title of Marker film ""Remembrance of things to Come"", and titled “Remembrance of the Future to Come.”</em></p>
<p><em>But when I was hospitalized last year, I strongly felt that I must meet Chris Marker. In the beginning of July 2012, I send him an email and requested the meeting. Soon I received a reply from him, and it says that he is currently hospitalized and not able to meet, and the sentence follows as below. </em></p>
<p><em>“but please, don’t consider that seeing Level Five at 20 should prevent you to make films for ever. You have a lot of creative life ahead of you, and that’s a treasure you have to enjoy fully – and believe me, I know what I’m talking about.”</em><br/><br/><em> Three weeks after I receive this e-mail, Marker has passed away. Since then, I was forced to think about the meaning of his words.</em><br/><br/><em> Chris Marker was born in 1921, the same birth year of Joseph Beuys, and moreover, Chris Marker himself says that he was born in Ulan Bator, Mongolia. So I started to think that in the process of the “Searching for Eur-Asia”, I will visit his birthplace Ulan Bator, and, can make a simple video work.</em><br/><br/><em> I call myself as a curator, so I am still a bit hesitant to make the video work, but in this time, I would like to challenge it.</em></p>
<p><em>I do not know exactly how it will turn out, but I am happy if you could join the perks, and could cooperate.</em> <br/><br/></p>

<h3 align=""left"">■今回のプロジェクトの目的、成果</h3>
<p align=""left"">　このプロジェクトは、ベルリンにてキュレーター活動を行う渡辺真也による、ユーラシア大陸横断のフィールドワーク・プロジェクトです。このプロジェクトでは、ヨーロッパとアジアが一つの大陸文化であることを確認すべく、ベルリンから日本へと飛行機を使わずに陸路で旅をしながらリサーチを行います。このフィールドワークと研究に必要となる費用を皆さんからご協力頂き、その成果を支援者の皆さんと共有したいと考えています。</p>
<h3 align=""left"">■なぜこのプロジェクトをやりたいのか</h3>
<p align=""left"">　私はニューヨークに7年滞在し、またバックパッカーとしてアジア・ヨーロッパを中心に43カ国を旅しながら、美術の研究を続けて来ました。その過程にて、西洋と東洋、もしくはヨーロッパとアジアと呼ばれているものはあくまで想像上の分断に過ぎず、双方が同じルーツを共有し、影響を受け合いながら発達してきたことに気付きました。</p>
<p align=""left""><img alt=""Joseph Beuys and Nam June Paik"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.asahi.com/culture/news_culture/images/TKY200912240242.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p align=""left"">　私がそう思うに至る過程には、西のヨーロッパ（Europe）と東のアジア（Asia）は一つの大陸文化であると考え、その二つを「ユーラシア(Eur-Asia)」として融合させようと試みた　ドイツ人アーティストのヨーゼフ・ボイスと、韓国人アーティストのナム・ジュン・パイクの活動からの影響があります。また彼らの芸術活動「ユーラシア」の背景には、第二次世界大戦の体験と、それに続くドイツと朝鮮半島の東西・南北の分裂があり、彼らは戦争の原因である国家やイデオロギーなどの分断を乗り越えるべく、東西融合の理想を掲げました。</p>
<p align=""left""><img alt=""Joseph Beuys, Fat Chair and Felt Suit"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BLQWybQCEAAUeZy.jpg:large"" src="""" style="""" title=""Joseph Beuys, Fat Chair and Felt Suit""/></p>
<p align=""left"">　ドイツ空軍のパイロットだったヨーゼフ・ボイスは22歳の頃、自身の操縦する爆撃機がクリミア半島に墜落した際、現地のタタール人が彼の身体に脂肪を塗り、フェルトを巻いて彼の身体を暖めてくれたことから一命を取り留めました。その後アーティストとなった彼は、脂肪やフェルトを使った彫刻作品を作り始め、後に「社会彫刻」という概念を生み出し、ドイツ緑の党を結党しました。</p>
<p><img alt=""Nam June Paik"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://knifefight.typepad.com/my_weblog/images/njp_rip.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Nam June Paik""/></p>
<p align=""left"">　日本占領下の朝鮮半島に生まれたナム・ジュン・パイクは、家族が日本軍の協力者だったことから朝鮮戦争の勃発に伴い日本に亡命し、東京大学を卒業後、ドイツとアメリカにて芸術活動を開始しました。ビデオアートの父として知られるパイクは、1974年にクリントン政権によって後に実現されたインターネットの原型「エレクトロニック・スーパーハイウェイ」構想を生み出し、さらに世界初の衛星技術を用いたアートプロジェクトにて、東洋世界と西洋世界をリアルタイムで繋ぐことに成功しました。</p>
<p><img alt=""Rehabilitation of Genghis Khan"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://eng.theartro.kr/__boardstyle/TAE/ISSUE/file/20121018190946_1048125215_1.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Rehabilitation of Genghis Khan""/></p>
<p align=""left"">　ボイスとパイク共に、ユーラシア大陸の東西を繋いだチンギス・ハーンを、作品のモチーフとして多用しています。ボイスを救済したクリミア半島に住むタタール人のルーツはモンゴル帝国のロシア侵攻から始まりますが、パイクは韓国文化のルーツは漢王朝以前にシベリアを往来した騎馬民族スキタイにあると考えました。ドイツ統一後初となるベニス・ビエンナーレにて、ドイツのナショナル・パビリオンを初の外国人アーティストとして代表したパイクは、西洋世界における東方への誤解を解くべく、韓国の古い自転車に乗ったビデオ彫刻作品「チンギス・カーンのリハビリテーション」を制作し、西洋世界における彼の評判の回復に務めました。</p>
<p><img alt=""Joseph Beuys and Dalai Lama"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://wdw-nl.s3.amazonaws.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Beuys_DalaiLama1-e1358763719152.jpg?a36242"" src="""" style="""" title=""Joseph Beuys and Dalai Lama""/></p>
<p align=""left"">　芸術家として社会を彫刻しようと試みたヨーゼフ・ボイスは、世界最大の美術展ドクメンタにダライ・ラマを招致し、樹木を植えて社会を彫刻する作品「7000本の樫の木」の共同制作を試みました。ボイスの当初の試みは失敗したものの、ボイスの死後、ダライ・ラマは「彼のダライ・ラマ法王との永久協力を記念して」7本の樫の木を購入しました。またボイス追悼として、パイクはソ連軍に強制連行された日本軍捕虜たちの強制労働により建てられたロシアの都市イルクーツクへと旅し、その記録からビデオ作品を制作しました。</p>
<p align=""left"">　私はこの東洋と西洋という概念が想像上のものに過ぎず、双方が影響を受け合いながら発達してきたと確信を得るに至ったのですが、このユーラシアの「草原の道」における言語的、宗教的、音楽的な繋がりがどう存在しているのか、現地に行ってフィールドワークする必要を感じています。そこで私は今年の夏、7月半ばから9月末までの10週間、ユーラシア大陸を陸路で横断してみよう、と考えるに至りました。</p>
<p align=""left""><img alt=""Eurasia Visiting Cities"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BLQNxtxCMAAGChZ.jpg:large"" src="""" style="""" title=""Eurasia Visiting Cities""/></p>
<p align=""left"">　まずベルリンから、ヨーゼフ・ボイスが墜落したウクライナのクリミア半島へと向かい、現地のタタール人たちに会って、実際に身体に脂肪を塗るという治療が行われていたのか、調べてきたいと思います。その後サマルカンドなどのシルクロードの都市を通過してシベリア経由でイルクーツクへと向かい、現地でお亡くなりになった日本人捕虜たちに献花して来ます。その語シベリアの「草原の道」を東に向かい、モンゴルと中国を通過して船で朝鮮半島へと渡り、ソウルのナム・ジュンパイク・アートセンターを訪ねた後、船で日本へと帰国します。</p>
<p align=""left"">　そこでのフィールドワークを元に、ユーラシアは一つの大陸文化だとする、ボイスとパイクの芸術活動の意味を立証してベルリン芸術大学の博士論文としてまとめ、さらにヨーゼフ・ボイスとナム・ジュン・パイク作品による美術展示といった形へと昇華させ、ドイツ、韓国、日本を巡回させることで、彼等の夢であったユーラシア大陸を一つに繋げたいと思います。</p>
<p align=""left""> </p>
<p align=""left"">　同じ地球上に住む私たちが、お互いを知らず、全く別のものだと考えることが、互いの猜疑心や敵対概念を生んでいて、それが戦争を引き起こしているではないでしょうか？自分たちとは全く別だと思っていた文化や人々が、自分と繋がっていることに気付くことができれば、戦争を揚棄することさえ可能なのではないでしょうか？</p>
<p align=""left"">　このフィールドワークから齎された結果が、近代の終焉を迎えつつある人類の未来を照らし出す、大きな共有資産になることを信じて疑いません。</p>

</ul><p><br/><em>皆さんこんにちは。渡辺真也です。今日は追加のパークスをご案内したいと思います。 </em></p>
<p><em>私は今回のフィールドワークの様子を、映像作品にしたいと考えています。そこには、映画監督クリス・マルケルとの出会い、そして別れがあります。 </em></p>
<p><em>私は映画が好きで、大学時代にはシネマ研究会に所属していました。20歳の頃、バックパッカーとしてアジア7カ国周遊の旅に出た際、その様子を撮影して映画を作りたい、と考えていました。</em></p>
<p><em> シンガポールからマレーシア中部を通る電車の中でのことです。私の隣に一人の老人が座り、マレーシアの習慣や言葉などについて、3時間ほど親切に教えて下さいました。目的地の駅が近づくにつれ、その老人はそわそわし始めたのですが、電車が減速し始めると、彼は決心したかの様に「君に聞いてもらいたい歌がある」と言うなり、右手を大きく振りながら「ハッコウイチウノー」と歌い始めました。突然のことでとても驚いたのですが、それが日本の皇民化政策の際に強制させられた日本の軍歌だ、ということが直感的に理解できました。 </em></p>
<p><em>そのフレーズを歌うなり、老人はその場に泣き崩れてしまいました。「お願いです。もう少し話を聞かせてもらえませんか？」と言うと、彼は電車を降りて、日本軍の言語政策が徹底的だったこと、そして今老人となったマレーシア人の多くがその経験を心の奥にしまってきた事など、胸の詰まる話をして下さいました。私は「私がここで直接あなたに何かをしてあげることはできないけれど、あなたから伺ったお話を、日本の若者に絶対に伝えます」と言うと、彼は涙を流しながら私の手を強く握ってくれました。</em></p>
<p><em>このやりとりの一部をビデオに録画していた私は、老人との約束を果たすべく、帰国するなり先輩の家に泊りこみ、編集作業を開始しました。私は帰国の1ヶ月後にアメリカ留学を控えていたのですが、パソコンの不良で作業が進まず、ついに映画を完成させることができませんでした。 </em></p>
<p><em>落ち込んでいた私を励ます為、先輩が連れて行ってくれたのが、クリス・マルケル監督の映画「Level Five」の上映会でした。この映画は沖縄戦の記憶をテーマとしたものですが、渡嘉敷島の集団自決にて自らの家族を殺めた金城神父が、その理由を「愛故に」と語り、それでは「愛とは何か？」と映画が進むにつれ、私はこれより優れた映画を作ることは到底不可能だと悟り、この優れた映像作品を紹介する側、つまりキュレーターになろう、と決心して渡米しました。 </em></p>
<p><em>キュレーターとして、日本の平和憲法と戦後美術をテーマとした展示を作り、ニューヨークから沖縄へと巡回させた際、私はどうしても、この沖縄県渡嘉敷島の集団自決をテーマとしたマルケル監督の『Level Five』を上映しなくてはならない、と強く思い、それを実現しました。沖縄にてこの映画を上映することは困難でしたが、上映会が成功したことを写真を添えてマルケル監督に送った所大変喜んで下さり、その写真をデジタル加工して送り返して下さいました。それは私にとっての宝物です。</em></p>

Searching for Eur-Asia Video Project:Homage to Chris Marker


*For the details of the project, please click the image above. (The English text version is also availabe in the bottom of this English description.)
 
■ Aim of the Project

This is a trans-continental fieldwork project by a Berlin based independent curator Shinya Watanabe. This trip aims to verify that Europe and Asia is one continental culture, and to do so, I will travel from Berlin to Japan by land, without using an airplane. I would like to raise the cost of this fieldwork, and would like to share both the processes and the outcome of the fieldwork with supporters.

■ Why do I want to realize this project?

While living in New York City for 7 years and had traveled 43 countries mainly in Europe and Asia as a back-packer, I have continued my research on art history.
In the process, I realized that what is so called “Europe” and “Asia”, or “West” and “East” is mere an imaginary division, and found that both of them shares the same roots, and had been developed by influencing each other.

To think like that, I have been influenced by German Artist Joseph Beuys and Korean artist Nam June Paik’s life long collaborative art project called “Eur-Asia”. Through this project, they tried to unite Europe in its west and Asia in its east as one continental culture of “Eur-Asia”.
On the background of their artistic activities of ""Eur-Asia"", there are severe World War II experience, and the subsequent divide of east-west Germamany and north-south Korea. To overcome these divides, such as ideogogy and the states which could be also the cause of war, they declear the ideal – the unity of Europe and Asia as “Eur-Asia”.

When 22 years old Joseph Beuys piloting Germany Air Force bomber, his airplane  crashed in Crimea, Ukraine. He says that local Tatars warmed up injured Beuys’s body with fat and felt, therefore he could save his life. Later he used these materials for his scuptural artwork, and his concept of ""social sculpture"" lead him to be the founding member of the German Green Party.

Born 1932 in Korea under Japanese occupation, Nam June Paik became an exile in Japan due to the outbreak of Korean War, together with his family who supported Japanese occupation military. After graduating University of Tokyo, he started his artistic activity in West Germany and later in the States. Known as the father of video art, Paik also created the ""Electronic Superhighway"", the prototype of the Internet in 1974, which later had been established during Bill Clinton’s administration. Moreover, his satellite art project connected Western world and Eastern world in real time.

Both Beuys and Paik frequently used Genghis Khan as a motif of the work. The origin of Criream Tatars goes back to the Mongol invasion of Rus', and Paik considered that the root of Korean culture goes back to Scythian who had traffic to Siberia, before the Han Dynasty. At the first Venice Biennale after the reunification of Germany in 1993, Paik represented German National Pavilion as a foreigner, the first time in the world.  Having aware of the misunderstanding and the fear toward the East in Europe, Paik created the video sculpture  ""Rehabilitation of Genghis Khan,"" riding on old Korean bicycle, for the recovery of his reputation in the Western world.

Joseph Beuys tried to invite Dalai Lama to Documenta 7, the largest art festival in Europe, and tried to collaborate his social sculpture “7000 Oaks”. Beuys’s intention could not be successful, but after the death of Beuys, the Dalai Lama purchased seven oaks, to commemorating their permanent cooperation. As a memorial to Beuys, Paik travelled to Irukutk in Siberia, the city built by Japanese prisoners of war who were taken by the Soviet army, and made a video art work.
I became confident that the concept of the East and the West is mere imaginary existence, and both have been developed by influencing each other. However, I feel a need to know how the continuity of language, religious and musical connection exist in Eurasian “Steppe Road”.  Therefore I decided to cross the Eurasian continent by land, by spending 10 week, from mid July to the end of September.

First, I depart Berlin, and go to Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine where Joseph Beuys’s bomber crashed, and will do a research with local Tatars whether the treatment using fat had actually existed or not. Then visit some Silk Road cities including Samarkand, and go to Irkutsk via Siberia, and there I will offer flowers to the Japanese prisoners who passed away. Then continue “Steppe Road” of Siberia to east through Mongolia and China, and then goes to Korean Peninsula by ferry, and visit the Nam June Paik Art Center in Seoul. Then I will go back to my home country Japan by ferry.
Based on this field work, I will complete my doctoral thesis on “Eur-Asia”, which proves that Eurasia is a one continental culture as Beuys and Paik suggested, at the University of the Arts in Berlin. Moreover, based on this thesis, I would like to curate the exhibition “Eur-Asia” with their artworks,  and would like to make it travel from Germany, Korea and Japan to realize their dream.
 
Isn’t it a cause of war, that all of us living on the same earth do not know each other, and considering others as completely different thing, which cause any suspision or hostility? Don’t you think that we can abolish the war, if we could consider other people or cultures which you had thought completely different is actually connected to your own?
Now we are facing the end of modernity, and even experiencing the shift of civilization. I believe that the outcome of this field work will be the great common assets of humankind, and will illuminate our future after the end of modernity.

-- New Perks Offer! -- 



""Searching for Eur-Asia"" Video Project:Homage to Chris Marker 


Hello everybody! This is Shinya Watanabe. Today, I would like to offer you the additional perks.
In the process of this field work, I would like to make a video work. As a motivation to do so, there is a meeting and farewell with a film maker, Chris Marker. I love movie, and when I was in a college, I was a member of the cinema research club. When I was 20-year-old, I left for a journey of visiting seven countries in Asia as a back-packer, and want to make a short movie. This is a story in the Jungle Train, a train crossing the jungle from Singapole to Malaysia. An old man sat next to me, and he kindly told me about the customs and language of Malaysia for three hours. When the train approached the destination and started to slow down, the old man says, ""I have a song which I would like to sing for you"", and swinging his right arm, he began to sing, such as ""hakkou ichiuno"". I was surprised, but I could intuitively tell that it is Japanese military’s war song, which had been forced to local people under imperial policy of Japan. Afte singing this short phrase, this old man collapsed on the spot. So I asked, "" Could you tell me the story a little bit more?"", then he got off the train with me. Then he told me that the language policy of the Japanese army was throughgoing, and the Malaysian people who experienced it and now become old put that memory deep into their own hearts.
I was moved, and said, ""it is not possible that I can do something for  you here, but I will tell this story to young Japanese people for sure."" He cried, and squeezed my hand strongly. To achieve the promise of this old man, as soon as I return to Japan, I started to stay my senior friend’s house, and start the video editing. I already had a plan ahead to study abroad to the United States within a month. Unfortunately, because of the technical problem, I could not complete the film editing in the end. To encourage me, my senior frined invited me to the film screening of ""Level Five"" directed by Chris Marker. The theme of the film is based on the memory of the Battle of Okinawa. In the collective self-determination of Okinawa, Mr. Kinjo who became priest was asked, why did you kill your own family member, and he answers, because I loved them. Then the narrator asks “what is love?”, and the film continues. Then I realized that it is impossible to make a better film than what Chris Marker had made, and I should be on the side to introduce great works, and decided to be a curator, and left to America.
After I became a curator, I curated an exhibition on the theme of post-war art under Japan’s peace constitution, and I made this exhibition travelled from NY to Tokyo and Okinawa.  On that occation, by all means, I thought I should realize the screening of Chris Marker’s “Level Five” on the theme of collective self-determination of Tokashiki Island, in Okinawa Prefecture.
To screen this movie in Okinawa was difficult, but I realized it, and made it success. I sent a news of film screening’s success to Chris Marker, together with the photos of the screening, and Marker was happy, and digitally edit the photo and send back to me. It became my treasure. I have always paid respect to Chris Marker. When I curated the charity exhibition for Tohoku Eartuquake orphans in Switzerland, I quoted the title of Marker film ""Remembrance of things to Come"", and titled “Remembrance of the Future to Come.”
But when I was hospitalized last year, I strongly felt that I must meet Chris Marker. In the beginning of July 2012, I send him an email and requested the meeting. Soon I received a reply from him, and it says that he is currently hospitalized and not able to meet, and the sentence follows as below. 
“but please, don’t consider that seeing Level Five at 20 should prevent you to make films for ever. You have a lot of creative life ahead of you, and that’s a treasure you have to enjoy fully – and believe me, I know what I’m talking about.” Three weeks after I receive this e-mail, Marker has passed away. Since then, I was forced to think about the meaning of his words. Chris Marker was born in 1921, the same birth year of Joseph Beuys, and moreover, Chris Marker himself says that he was born in Ulan Bator, Mongolia. So I started to think that in the process of the “Searching for Eur-Asia”, I will visit his birthplace Ulan Bator, and, can make a simple video work. I call myself as a curator, so I am still a bit hesitant to make the video work, but in this time, I would like to challenge it.
I do not know exactly how it will turn out, but I am happy if you could join the perks, and could cooperate.

ユーラシアを探して：クリス・マルケル監督に捧げる映像化プロジェクト



＊クリス・マルケル監督に捧げる映像化プロジェクト紹介に関しては、イメージをクリックして下さい。（日本語文による詳細は下までスクロールしてご覧下さい）
 
■今回のプロジェクトの目的、成果
　このプロジェクトは、ベルリンにてキュレーター活動を行う渡辺真也による、ユーラシア大陸横断のフィールドワーク・プロジェクトです。このプロジェクトでは、ヨーロッパとアジアが一つの大陸文化であることを確認すべく、ベルリンから日本へと飛行機を使わずに陸路で旅をしながらリサーチを行います。このフィールドワークと研究に必要となる費用を皆さんからご協力頂き、その成果を支援者の皆さんと共有したいと考えています。
■なぜこのプロジェクトをやりたいのか
　私はニューヨークに7年滞在し、またバックパッカーとしてアジア・ヨーロッパを中心に43カ国を旅しながら、美術の研究を続けて来ました。その過程にて、西洋と東洋、もしくはヨーロッパとアジアと呼ばれているものはあくまで想像上の分断に過ぎず、双方が同じルーツを共有し、影響を受け合いながら発達してきたことに気付きました。

　私がそう思うに至る過程には、西のヨーロッパ（Europe）と東のアジア（Asia）は一つの大陸文化であると考え、その二つを「ユーラシア(Eur-Asia)」として融合させようと試みた　ドイツ人アーティストのヨーゼフ・ボイスと、韓国人アーティストのナム・ジュン・パイクの活動からの影響があります。また彼らの芸術活動「ユーラシア」の背景には、第二次世界大戦の体験と、それに続くドイツと朝鮮半島の東西・南北の分裂があり、彼らは戦争の原因である国家やイデオロギーなどの分断を乗り越えるべく、東西融合の理想を掲げました。

　ドイツ空軍のパイロットだったヨーゼフ・ボイスは22歳の頃、自身の操縦する爆撃機がクリミア半島に墜落した際、現地のタタール人が彼の身体に脂肪を塗り、フェルトを巻いて彼の身体を暖めてくれたことから一命を取り留めました。その後アーティストとなった彼は、脂肪やフェルトを使った彫刻作品を作り始め、後に「社会彫刻」という概念を生み出し、ドイツ緑の党を結党しました。

　日本占領下の朝鮮半島に生まれたナム・ジュン・パイクは、家族が日本軍の協力者だったことから朝鮮戦争の勃発に伴い日本に亡命し、東京大学を卒業後、ドイツとアメリカにて芸術活動を開始しました。ビデオアートの父として知られるパイクは、1974年にクリントン政権によって後に実現されたインターネットの原型「エレクトロニック・スーパーハイウェイ」構想を生み出し、さらに世界初の衛星技術を用いたアートプロジェクトにて、東洋世界と西洋世界をリアルタイムで繋ぐことに成功しました。

　ボイスとパイク共に、ユーラシア大陸の東西を繋いだチンギス・ハーンを、作品のモチーフとして多用しています。ボイスを救済したクリミア半島に住むタタール人のルーツはモンゴル帝国のロシア侵攻から始まりますが、パイクは韓国文化のルーツは漢王朝以前にシベリアを往来した騎馬民族スキタイにあると考えました。ドイツ統一後初となるベニス・ビエンナーレにて、ドイツのナショナル・パビリオンを初の外国人アーティストとして代表したパイクは、西洋世界における東方への誤解を解くべく、韓国の古い自転車に乗ったビデオ彫刻作品「チンギス・カーンのリハビリテーション」を制作し、西洋世界における彼の評判の回復に務めました。

　芸術家として社会を彫刻しようと試みたヨーゼフ・ボイスは、世界最大の美術展ドクメンタにダライ・ラマを招致し、樹木を植えて社会を彫刻する作品「7000本の樫の木」の共同制作を試みました。ボイスの当初の試みは失敗したものの、ボイスの死後、ダライ・ラマは「彼のダライ・ラマ法王との永久協力を記念して」7本の樫の木を購入しました。またボイス追悼として、パイクはソ連軍に強制連行された日本軍捕虜たちの強制労働により建てられたロシアの都市イルクーツクへと旅し、その記録からビデオ作品を制作しました。
　私はこの東洋と西洋という概念が想像上のものに過ぎず、双方が影響を受け合いながら発達してきたと確信を得るに至ったのですが、このユーラシアの「草原の道」における言語的、宗教的、音楽的な繋がりがどう存在しているのか、現地に行ってフィールドワークする必要を感じています。そこで私は今年の夏、7月半ばから9月末までの10週間、ユーラシア大陸を陸路で横断してみよう、と考えるに至りました。

　まずベルリンから、ヨーゼフ・ボイスが墜落したウクライナのクリミア半島へと向かい、現地のタタール人たちに会って、実際に身体に脂肪を塗るという治療が行われていたのか、調べてきたいと思います。その後サマルカンドなどのシルクロードの都市を通過してシベリア経由でイルクーツクへと向かい、現地でお亡くなりになった日本人捕虜たちに献花して来ます。その語シベリアの「草原の道」を東に向かい、モンゴルと中国を通過して船で朝鮮半島へと渡り、ソウルのナム・ジュンパイク・アートセンターを訪ねた後、船で日本へと帰国します。
　そこでのフィールドワークを元に、ユーラシアは一つの大陸文化だとする、ボイスとパイクの芸術活動の意味を立証してベルリン芸術大学の博士論文としてまとめ、さらにヨーゼフ・ボイスとナム・ジュン・パイク作品による美術展示といった形へと昇華させ、ドイツ、韓国、日本を巡回させることで、彼等の夢であったユーラシア大陸を一つに繋げたいと思います。
 
　同じ地球上に住む私たちが、お互いを知らず、全く別のものだと考えることが、互いの猜疑心や敵対概念を生んでいて、それが戦争を引き起こしているではないでしょうか？自分たちとは全く別だと思っていた文化や人々が、自分と繋がっていることに気付くことができれば、戦争を揚棄することさえ可能なのではないでしょうか？
　このフィールドワークから齎された結果が、近代の終焉を迎えつつある人類の未来を照らし出す、大きな共有資産になることを信じて疑いません。

ユーラシアを探して：クリス・マルケル監督に捧げる映像化プロジェクト


皆さんこんにちは。渡辺真也です。今日は追加のパークスをご案内したいと思います。 
私は今回のフィールドワークの様子を、映像作品にしたいと考えています。そこには、映画監督クリス・マルケルとの出会い、そして別れがあります。 
私は映画が好きで、大学時代にはシネマ研究会に所属していました。20歳の頃、バックパッカーとしてアジア7カ国周遊の旅に出た際、その様子を撮影して映画を作りたい、と考えていました。
 シンガポールからマレーシア中部を通る電車の中でのことです。私の隣に一人の老人が座り、マレーシアの習慣や言葉などについて、3時間ほど親切に教えて下さいました。目的地の駅が近づくにつれ、その老人はそわそわし始めたのですが、電車が減速し始めると、彼は決心したかの様に「君に聞いてもらいたい歌がある」と言うなり、右手を大きく振りながら「ハッコウイチウノー」と歌い始めました。突然のことでとても驚いたのですが、それが日本の皇民化政策の際に強制させられた日本の軍歌だ、ということが直感的に理解できました。 
そのフレーズを歌うなり、老人はその場に泣き崩れてしまいました。「お願いです。もう少し話を聞かせてもらえませんか？」と言うと、彼は電車を降りて、日本軍の言語政策が徹底的だったこと、そして今老人となったマレーシア人の多くがその経験を心の奥にしまってきた事など、胸の詰まる話をして下さいました。私は「私がここで直接あなたに何かをしてあげることはできないけれど、あなたから伺ったお話を、日本の若者に絶対に伝えます」と言うと、彼は涙を流しながら私の手を強く握ってくれました。
このやりとりの一部をビデオに録画していた私は、老人との約束を果たすべく、帰国するなり先輩の家に泊りこみ、編集作業を開始しました。私は帰国の1ヶ月後にアメリカ留学を控えていたのですが、パソコンの不良で作業が進まず、ついに映画を完成させることができませんでした。 
落ち込んでいた私を励ます為、先輩が連れて行ってくれたのが、クリス・マルケル監督の映画「Level Five」の上映会でした。この映画は沖縄戦の記憶をテーマとしたものですが、渡嘉敷島の集団自決にて自らの家族を殺めた金城神父が、その理由を「愛故に」と語り、それでは「愛とは何か？」と映画が進むにつれ、私はこれより優れた映画を作ることは到底不可能だと悟り、この優れた映像作品を紹介する側、つまりキュレーターになろう、と決心して渡米しました。 
キュレーターとして、日本の平和憲法と戦後美術をテーマとした展示を作り、ニューヨークから沖縄へと巡回させた際、私はどうしても、この沖縄県渡嘉敷島の集団自決をテーマとしたマルケル監督の『Level Five』を上映しなくてはならない、と強く思い、それを実現しました。沖縄にてこの映画を上映することは困難でしたが、上映会が成功したことを写真を添えてマルケル監督に送った所大変喜んで下さり、その写真をデジタル加工して送り返して下さいました。それは私にとっての宝物です。
その後も、私は震災復興のチャリティ展示をスイスでキュレーションした際、そのタイトル「来るべき未来への追憶(Remembrance of the Future to Come)」を、マルケル監督の映画""Remembrance of things to Come""から引用するなど、彼へのリスペクトを常に払ってきました。しかし去年、私が体調を崩して入院した際、私はどうしてもマルケル監督だけには会わなくてはならない、という気持ちが強く湧いてきて、2012年7月のはじめに「ぜひお会いしたい」という旨のメールをお送り差し上げました。するとマルケル監督から返事があり、現在入院中であり、会うことができないというメッセージに続いて、そこにはこう書かれていました。
「二十歳のあなたが私の映画を見て映画監督の夢を諦めたことは、あなたが今後映画を撮らない理由にはなりません。あなたのクリエイティブ・ライフは目の前に開いていて、それがあなたの宝なのです。Believe me, I know what I am talking about」 
その3週間後、マルケル監督はお亡くなりになりました。そして私は、その言葉の持つ意味を考えざるを得なくなりました。
 マルケル監督は、ヨーゼフ・ボイスと同じ1921年の生まれ、しかも彼自身はモンゴルのウランバートルに生まれた、と言っています。そこで私は、今回の「ユーラシアを探して」の旅の途上にて、彼の生まれ故郷であるウランバートルの様子も撮影し、簡単な映像作品を作ってみたい、と思うに至りました。

The amount I am seeking will cover what it takes to put on an exhibition showcasing a full and varied collection with many pieces being much larger and  exploring media from fiber to metallic, to deep matte, to canvas.  Then, there's framing using different formats and treatments along with space rental, installation, reception, etc.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Hello all! Let me start by just saying thank you for taking the time to read my story. Every little bit helps...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ever since I was legally old enough to get inked I have made it a yearly tradition to add a new piece of art to the canvas that is my body. It all started back in 2008 when I lost someone very close to me. My aunt had passed away after battling with cancer. This woman was like a second mother to me. As a means of coping, as well as to give proper tribute to her, I got my first tattoo in memory of my aunt.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After that I felt a great sense of emotional release. I was also hooked. For any of you who have gotten work done, you know what I am talking about. For those who havent, it is truly an addicting experience and when done by a skilled artist, you are left with an amazing piece of art that is unique and has a story behind it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Every October, the month in which she passed, I would go and add to my collection. This year however, I may be forced to break tradition. After recieving financial aid my whole college career, I was denied this semester and am forced to pay my tuition out of pocket. I am struggling as it is to make that work - let alone to put enough aside to get my next piece.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
I am looking to recieve enough to complete my next tattoo. Every tattoo I get has a special meaning and a purpose. I use imagery and elements from Norse mythology to tell my story and honor those that mean the most to me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have been doing my best to pick up extra hours at work to put some money aside but it has been very hard. I will be utilizing the flexible campaign option so I will use what i get to get as much work done as possible. The great thing about tattoos is that they can be done in segments. I will be greatful for every penny I get and my passion for the art form, alongside the fact that my tattoos hold a personal meaning, will ensure that the funds are used as promised. I will post pictures as soon as I get the tattoo finished.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I realize that some of you will be giving up your money to help my cause so I will be offering perks to those amazing indivduals who do contibute.  For those of you who are brave enough to give a large amount, there will be a special perk just for you - take a look.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Aside from the listed perks, as a tattoo lover, anyone who contibutes a significant amount: if you have a tattoo related campaign in the future, let me know and I will be sure to repay the favor.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
October is a rough month for me to get through, the memory of my aunt is one that will continue to live on with every year that passes. Those who have lost a loved one know how hard it can be; it never truly goes away. Finding ways to cope and remember the good times are all that we can do. For me its done through tattoos.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I meet my goal I can continue my tradition. Even if you cant relate to my story, as long as you have an appreciation for the art form you can help.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I just want to once again say thank you for taking the time to read my story. Please help spread the word about this campaign. For those who do help me out, know that I wont forget it.</p>

<p> </p>Todos sabemos que debajo de la cama viven monstruos, lo que poca gente conoce es que estos monstruos se llaman Alicuencanitos. No son feos, no muerden, y no intentarán asustarte. Normalmente se conforman con merendar pelusas y esconderte las zapatillas, pero también les gusta la compañía y salir de debajo de la cama. Recuerda asomarte y saludarles siempre que puedas.<br/> <p> </p>

<p>Este proyecto empezó como una forma de aplicar ilustración a producto, de manera artesanal y hecha a mano. Poco a poco fue tomando forma, pero la falta de tiempo y presupuesto obligó a ""parar"" el proyecto, ya que con pocos recursos resultaba desbordante e inasumible.</p>
<p>Básicamente, la cifra que se pretende alcanzar se dedicará a 3 objetivos:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Fabricación de los muñecos (producto principal).</b> Los prototipos y primeros muñecos a la venta se han estado realizando en sarga de algodón impresa y posteriormente cosida. El resultado es un muñeco con todo lujo de detalles, 100% ecológico, seguro para los más pequeños, y por supuesto, blandito y adorable!</li>
<li>
<b>Packaging.</b> O lo que es lo mismo, embalaje de cada producto para su venta.</li>
<li>
<b>Productos alternativos.</b> Calcomanías, láminas, material de papelería, accesorios, bolsos... la magia de este proyecto es que ofrece infinitas posibilidades, al fin y al cabo, todo comenzó aplicando una ilustración a un producto. ¡Expansión!</li>
<li>
<b>¡Gastos aburridos!</b> Pero igualmente necesarios. Comenzar cualquier actividad de este tipo requiere una serie de gastos burocráticos lamentablemente ineludibles.</li>
</ul>

<p>El primero. El clásico. El primogénito. Habichuela vive debajo de la cama y se alimenta de pelusas. Tiene cierta tendencia a la cleptomanía de calzado, especialmente zapatillas de cuadros y franela, que son sus favoritas. Hace años, un verano, descubrió que no tenía ombligo y se puso triste. Salvo ese momento, siempre ha sido el Alicuencanito más feliz y con menos dientes de todos.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/808987/files/20140824132723-presentacion05.jpg?1408912043"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>El único Alicuencanito volador, que no vive bajo la cama, ya que es alérgico a las pelusas. Calabaza prefiere el aire libre durante el día, y duerme en los armarios por las noches, siempre y cuando estén lo suficientemente desordenados como para sentirse cómodo. Cree que puede camuflarse entre las lámparas de Ikea, pero no.</p>

<p>Con sus cuatro patas, Galleta es un portento del fútbol alicuencanil. Compagina su trabajo de jugador profesional con el de balón de reglamento. En sus ratos libres juega a la petanca. Es algo corto de vista, pero demasiado presumido para usar sus tres monóculos.</p>

<p>Cuentan que el señor Wilson es un emigrante gallego, originalmente llamado Eulogio Pazos, que se dedica al extraperlo de percebes y licor café. Ahora vive sus días de retiro en Inglaterra, acompañado de su mujer Margaret. Perdió las cejas en el año 43, combatiendo en la guerra cuando tan sólo era un joven cojín de trinchera.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#999;text-align: center;""><strong>Espera... ¿sólo esos?</strong></h3>
<hr style=""height:1px;background:#dddd01;""/>
<p>¡Claro que no! Alicuencanitos hay tantos como camas en el mundo, evidentemente. Tendréis que buscarlos, si se dejan.</p>
<p>Aparte de los cuatro que ya conocéis, hay otros que han cedido sus derechos de imagen para este proyecto:</p>
<p>Mrs. Margaret, señora de Wilson, toda una artista del macramé con pelusas, y profesora de la escuela alicuencanil. Menta y Arándano son sus dos únicos alumnos, el primero y el último de la clase, respectivamente. Y por último, Dumb. Es un alicuencanito.... especial. Hay que quererlo.</p>

</div></div>","Todos sabemos que debajo de la cama viven monstruos, lo que poca gente conoce es que estos monstruos se llaman Alicuencanitos. No son feos, no muerden, y no intentarán asustarte. Normalmente se conforman con merendar pelusas y esconderte las zapatillas, pero también les gusta la compañía y salir de debajo de la cama. Recuerda asomarte y saludarles siempre que puedas.  

 

Este proyecto empezó como una forma de aplicar ilustración a producto, de manera artesanal y hecha a mano. Poco a poco fue tomando forma, pero la falta de tiempo y presupuesto obligó a ""parar"" el proyecto, ya que con pocos recursos resultaba desbordante e inasumible.
Básicamente, la cifra que se pretende alcanzar se dedicará a 3 objetivos:


Fabricación de los muñecos (producto principal). Los prototipos y primeros muñecos a la venta se han estado realizando en sarga de algodón impresa y posteriormente cosida. El resultado es un muñeco con todo lujo de detalles, 100% ecológico, seguro para los más pequeños, y por supuesto, blandito y adorable!

Packaging. O lo que es lo mismo, embalaje de cada producto para su venta.

Productos alternativos. Calcomanías, láminas, material de papelería, accesorios, bolsos... la magia de este proyecto es que ofrece infinitas posibilidades, al fin y al cabo, todo comenzó aplicando una ilustración a un producto. ¡Expansión!

¡Gastos aburridos! Pero igualmente necesarios. Comenzar cualquier actividad de este tipo requiere una serie de gastos burocráticos lamentablemente ineludibles.

 
 
 

Te presento a los Alicuencanitos:
 

El primero. El clásico. El primogénito. Habichuela vive debajo de la cama y se alimenta de pelusas. Tiene cierta tendencia a la cleptomanía de calzado, especialmente zapatillas de cuadros y franela, que son sus favoritas. Hace años, un verano, descubrió que no tenía ombligo y se puso triste. Salvo ese momento, siempre ha sido el Alicuencanito más feliz y con menos dientes de todos.

El único Alicuencanito volador, que no vive bajo la cama, ya que es alérgico a las pelusas. Calabaza prefiere el aire libre durante el día, y duerme en los armarios por las noches, siempre y cuando estén lo suficientemente desordenados como para sentirse cómodo. Cree que puede camuflarse entre las lámparas de Ikea, pero no.

Con sus cuatro patas, Galleta es un portento del fútbol alicuencanil. Compagina su trabajo de jugador profesional con el de balón de reglamento. En sus ratos libres juega a la petanca. Es algo corto de vista, pero demasiado presumido para usar sus tres monóculos.

Cuentan que el señor Wilson es un emigrante gallego, originalmente llamado Eulogio Pazos, que se dedica al extraperlo de percebes y licor café. Ahora vive sus días de retiro en Inglaterra, acompañado de su mujer Margaret. Perdió las cejas en el año 43, combatiendo en la guerra cuando tan sólo era un joven cojín de trinchera.
Espera... ¿sólo esos?

¡Claro que no! Alicuencanitos hay tantos como camas en el mundo, evidentemente. Tendréis que buscarlos, si se dejan.
Aparte de los cuatro que ya conocéis, hay otros que han cedido sus derechos de imagen para este proyecto:
Mrs. Margaret, señora de Wilson, toda una artista del macramé con pelusas, y profesora de la escuela alicuencanil. Menta y Arándano son sus dos únicos alumnos, el primero y el último de la clase, respectivamente. Y por último, Dumb. Es un alicuencanito.... especial. Hay que quererlo.
 
     
     
 
Todos los muñecos están fabricados en sarga de algodón 100%, posteriormente impresa con tintas ecológicas, cosida, y rellena con fibras también de algodón natural.El proceso, hoy por hoy hecho a mano, es tedioso y caro. El principal objetivo es poder asumir una fabricación de mayor volumen, de manera que sea posible encargar la manufactura a artesanos/fabricantes locales. De esa forma sería posible atender pedidos de una manera más lógica y abaratar los costes (tanto de producción, como el precio final del producto).
 
 
Hemos probado con tazas, mochilas, calcomanías (tattoos), peluches gigantes, camisetas... nuevos personajes, e infinidad de nuevas ideas. Las posibilidades son casi infinitas! Y nos encanta seguir creando y experimentando. O al menos, nos encantaría poder hacerlo. 







 
 
 


A ti, que has llegado hasta aquí. Quizá en este punto pienses, ""por qué no, voy a colaborar!"". Genial. Para empezar tienes todo mi agradecimiento, y espero firmemente que los dioses de tu elección te den una vida feliz llena de chocolate, gatos e hijos. O lo que prefieras. Aún así, de una manera más tangible, te ofrezco lo siguiente:


Donando 1€. Lámina digital. Elige entre varios tamaños/formatos, y úsala como más te guste! De fondo de escritorio, en tu móvil, imprímela...

Donando 5€. Set de calcomanías/tattoos, a elegir entre varios modelos.

<p>Veterans commit 20% of suicides in the United States. However, veterans only make up 1% of our total population.  My name is Richard Casper, and I can relate to veterans who are burdened by things they have seen or done during war.  I have been able to cope with my war-related issues through art, and would like to help other veterans do the same.  Please help me introduce art into the lives of people who do not have outlets for their problems…I believe art can help save them.</p>
<p>I am a disabled veteran and who was injured while deployed in Iraq in 2006 and 2007. When I came home I realized I brought with me problems that I did not know how to deal with: anxiety, depression, and a disconnect from normal life. I tried to better myself through the Veterans Hospital and other therapies, but nothing was working for me. It wasn’t until I started taking art classes at the local community college that I discovered art could help me. I now attend one of the best art schools in the country.</p>
<p>I truly believe that art can heal. One can take whatever pain is inside of himself and put it into clay, on paper, or canvas. I have better control over my disabilities and thoughts when I’m creating artwork. Give other veterans that same chance at a better life through art.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The impact of this program will be lives bettered, and possibly lives saved through art.  Veterans need an outlet for many issues they may come home with.  For me, there is no better outlet than art, and I believe other veterans can discover the same if they have the opportunity.  Non-veterans will be impacted by this program as well since they will get to experience any works that veteran artists would like to display.  The art can be thought-provoking and eye opening through the stories it will tell of the veterans’ experiences.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
Konichiwa!  My name is Linda and I want to go to Japan.  For the past three years I have taken on an early morning paper route so I could pay my bills while attending Boise State University pursuing a BFA Visual Arts - Photography emphasis degree.  As part of that program, I now have the opportunity to participate in an International exhibit through the Nagoya Zokei University in Japan.<br/><br/>I will have the opportunity to spend two weeks in Japan exhibiting my work at the Nagoya Zokei University while participating in workshops with other art and design students.  While there we will also have the opportunity to visit art museums and conduct field trips related to various art and design disciplines of Japan including paper making, textiles, ceramics, and landscape design.  As well as seeing Nagoya and the surrounding area, we will also visit Kyoto, visiting temples and gardens.<br/><br/>The trip is slated for June 8 - 23.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
It's hard to say what kind of an impact this will have on my life.  I do know, it will not be the same as it is today.  This will help launch the career I have always dreamed of.  For you, you'll know that you've supported the arts, helped me become better at my craft and have also assisted in making a dream come true for me.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
I need to raise enough money to cover everything for this trip.  Unfortunately, a paper route salary is not even enough to meet basic needs. There is nothing left over to plan a trip.  Costs will cover tuition, airfare, meals, event tickets, ground transportation, and lodging, as well as cover a substitute paper carrier in my absence.  There again, a paper carrier at the Idaho Statesman is not allowed a ""vacation.""  The paper must be delivered 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  International Learning Opportunities is providing scholarships to each student participant of $1300.  This will help greatly in reducing the cost, but it is still expensive.<br/><br/>You can help get me there by supporting this campaign with a contribution of whatever size.  Anything will bring me one step closer.  <br/><br/>If you've read this far, I already send my deepest gratitude.  If you decide to donate, look to the right to see perks offered.  <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Needless to say, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">SPREAD THE WORD!</span>  Please share this campaign every day on Facebook, Twitter, or anywhere you spend your time to get the word out and make some noise about my ""International Learning Opportunity.""  <br/><br/>And, use the share tools provided by IndiGoGo to get other folks in-the-know.  Thank you so much.<br/><br/>

<h3>#GivingTuesday Update!!</h3>
<h4>As we approach #GivingTuesday and we are nearly passed our goal (raising a whopping 99% in less than a week!). Help us to raise a new goal of $5000 to double our efforts in the local community by bringing even more arts-making activities into the community and funding for more opportunities to impact our women in our community through arts-based entrepreneurship. <br/>
</h4>
<h4>We have made such great progress in less than a week! Imagine what we can accomplish by December 22nd (the end of our campaign). Let's do even more! #GivingTuesday is only two days away so let's not only double our efforts for #GivingTuesday but keep pushing to enhance these programs. We have 23 more days until the campaign ends. So let's work together!</h4>
<h4>Double our efforts AND you will<br/>
</h4>
<h4>--Help us to fund another $250 in art supplies/materials to teach ongoing art/making classes with local children.</h4>
<h4>--Help to raise another $500 for our Young Curators Program to take young women ages 13-17 to another regional museum.</h4>
<h4>--Help us raise another $1000 toward support our Creative Entrepreneurship program.</h4>
<h4>--Help us to raise another $250 to hire 2-3 more artists to teach art classes.</h4>
<h4>--And help us to give another $500 grant to a local artists of color in the DFW area! <br/>
</h4>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>WoCA Projects is a non-profit artspace that highlights the works of women artists of color and artists of all backgrounds through exhibitions, and creates opportunities for the local community to become engaged in art through our community arts programs. WoCA Projects was founded in February 2013 by local Fort Worth artist, Lauren Cross, and since its opening has featured amazing exhibtions and art programs to the local community.</p>
<p><b>Beginning on #GivingTuesday</b>, WoCA Projects is raising funds to develop new, ongoing community arts programs for children, youth, and adults in the local Greater Fort Worth community. In a world where funds for art programs are continuously dwindling for the communities that need them the most, WoCA Projects would like to create more opportunities to serve children, youth, and adults in our local community. Community citizens who don't typically have access to art-making opportunities, and allow the community to have a voice in participating in creative approaches for social and cultural change.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3>
<p></p>
<p>By giving to our #GivingTuesday campaign you will help WoCA to create and bring innovative art programs to the local Fort Worth community that are relevant to the lives of local citizens in need of art education and creative development. <b>Your contribution of $25 could help us to raise some of these programming budget goals:</b></p>
<p>1. $250 worth of art supplies/materials to teach ongoing art-making classes and workshops to children from low to moderate income families both in our WoCA facility and in partnership with local community groups and organizations. </p>
<p>2. $500 to take a group of 15 young women, ages 13-17, on a trip to a local museum for WoCA's Young Art Curators Program: a program developed for young women ages 13-17  to be taught, trained, and given opportunities to explore careers in art/curating/exhibition-making. We hope to offer the program at little to no cost so your contribution will helps us to do it!</p>
<p>3. $1000 to begin a Creative Entrepreneurship program, which invests creative skill development and entrepreneurship training into 10-15 adult women in the local community to create their own supplemental income (i.e., art, jewelry-making, sewing, fashion, home/body products, etc), to fight poverty, and to help develop the local creative economy. The program will support participants by teaching skills in product development, marketing/communications, packaging/display, online store development, and allow participants to sell their products in the WoCA Projects a new WoCA Gift Shop, and at local hand-made market events.</p>
<p>4. $250 Hire to 2-3 teaching artists/creatives to offer affordable courses/workshops to the local community and to support our programs.</p>
<p>5. $500 to offer a modest artist material grant of up to $500 to a local Dallas/Fort Worth artist of color so that they can create new, innovative artwork.</p>
<p><b>Our #GivingTuesday campaign goal is to raise $2500, which would allow us to fund all of the programs listed above. So the more we raise the more we can do! </b>We are starting with one modest funding goal to support a variety of different projects in hopes that we will build support from the global community to keep these diverse programs going and refine them for the future. So help WoCA make a difference through art and creative practice! </p>

<h3><b>If We Don't Reach Our Entire Goal</b></h3>If we don't reach our goal, WoCA will still receive all funds that were raised; however, not raising our funding goal will limit the range of programs that we would like to offer. We want to be able to offer all of our programs, but we understand that sometimes budget does not allow us to. This is why we intentionally created contribution levels that match specific program needs so that if you are passionate about getting a certain program off the ground you can be a major contributor to that effort and make sure that it happens. This way, Groups/Businesses/Organizations might choose to come together and support and fund a specific program. So if the entire funding goal is not reached we at least are able to bring certain programs that funders felt passionate about to fruition. <br/><br/>If all funds are not raised and specific programs are not funded we will begin with the smallest funding goals and build from there (i.e., if we raise $500 we will be able to fund $250 worth of art supplies/materials to teach art-making classes to children in the local community and $250 to hire 2 to 3 teaching artists to teach workshops to the local community and to support our programs. Not bad for $500 raised!)</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This #GivingTuesday campaign will allow us to make a considerable impact in our local community by creating art programs that empower creative change and experiences. Your contribution will:</p> <ul> <li>Not only supports our initiative but allow you to be a change-maker in our community not just by your contribution but as an active participant in the lives of the people we hope to touch. </li>
<li>Spark creative action and help to build the local creative economy.</li>
<li>Encourage local communities to participate in more art-making activities and support a greater attention to building community through art.</li> </ul>
<div>In 2014, WoCA offered some really exciting art-making activities and programs that were connected to our featured art exhibitions. In 2015, our community arts program initiatives hope to reach beyond our exhibitions and create ongoing opportunities for the local community to benefit socially, culturally, and economically from our programs. We have already begun to partner with some local community groups and organizations that will allow us to accomplish our program initiatives and objectives. All we need is the funding to kick these programs off the ground. </div>
<div>Your contribution will help us to make a positive impact in the local community through the arts!</div> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We are aware that the programs we are trying to initiate in 2015 are ambitious! We have high goals and expectations for what art can accomplish in our local community.  We are driven by recent feedback from within the local community about how we can better serve the community through our programs. Please take heart! We will not be beginning these programs alone. We have many organizations and individuals in the local community that have already agreed to partner and volunteer and help us with our vision, and as we kick off these programs we will continue to seek community imput on how to best perfect our programs through: </p>
<p>- focus groups, interviews, and surveys to help evaluate or programs and strengthen them for future participants. </p>

As a funded project of Indiegogo, WoCA's Art 
in Community Programs campaign is now participating in Indiegogo's 
InDemand program--that is, our Art in Community programs campaign will 
continue to receive contributions!   As some of you know, as of 
January 2015, we recently moved from our then location on Race Street, 
and are in the process of moving to a new space. Nonetheless, through 
our community partners like the TCU Art Galleries and many other 
organizations, we are thrilled to be in the planning stages of many of 
our community arts programs!
Within the next few months 
we will begin disbursing links and information about our campaign perks,
 starting with a virtual tour of our 2nd Annual Juried Artist's Books 
Exhibition! 
We are grateful to the individuals and organizations that have given to our campaign through our fiscal sponsorship with Fractured Atlas even after the campaign ended. Fractured Atlas is the best way to give to our campaign if you would like your contribution to be tax-deductible. 
We
 are well on our way everyone! Great partnerships are popping up left 
and right and we are so excited! Looking forward to sharing new official
 updates with you. 
If you know someone who didn't have the opportunity to contribute to our campaign urge them to give now! #WoCAinCommunity #InDemand  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/art-in-community-programs-at-woca-projects/x/2813367___________________________________________________________________________
#GivingTuesday Update!!
As we approach #GivingTuesday and we are nearly passed our goal (raising a whopping 99% in less than a week!). Help us to raise a new goal of $5000 to double our efforts in the local community by bringing even more arts-making activities into the community and funding for more opportunities to impact our women in our community through arts-based entrepreneurship. 

We have made such great progress in less than a week! Imagine what we can accomplish by December 22nd (the end of our campaign). Let's do even more! #GivingTuesday is only two days away so let's not only double our efforts for #GivingTuesday but keep pushing to enhance these programs. We have 23 more days until the campaign ends. So let's work together!
Double our efforts AND you will

--Help us to fund another $250 in art supplies/materials to teach ongoing art/making classes with local children.
--Help to raise another $500 for our Young Curators Program to take young women ages 13-17 to another regional museum.
--Help us raise another $1000 toward support our Creative Entrepreneurship program.
--Help us to raise another $250 to hire 2-3 more artists to teach art classes.
--And help us to give another $500 grant to a local artists of color in the DFW area! 

Short Summary
WoCA Projects is a non-profit artspace that highlights the works of women artists of color and artists of all backgrounds through exhibitions, and creates opportunities for the local community to become engaged in art through our community arts programs. WoCA Projects was founded in February 2013 by local Fort Worth artist, Lauren Cross, and since its opening has featured amazing exhibtions and art programs to the local community.
Beginning on #GivingTuesday, WoCA Projects is raising funds to develop new, ongoing community arts programs for children, youth, and adults in the local Greater Fort Worth community. In a world where funds for art programs are continuously dwindling for the communities that need them the most, WoCA Projects would like to create more opportunities to serve children, youth, and adults in our local community. Community citizens who don't typically have access to art-making opportunities, and allow the community to have a voice in participating in creative approaches for social and cultural change.   What We Need 

By giving to our #GivingTuesday campaign you will help WoCA to create and bring innovative art programs to the local Fort Worth community that are relevant to the lives of local citizens in need of art education and creative development. Your contribution of $25 could help us to raise some of these programming budget goals:
1. $250 worth of art supplies/materials to teach ongoing art-making classes and workshops to children from low to moderate income families both in our WoCA facility and in partnership with local community groups and organizations. 
2. $500 to take a group of 15 young women, ages 13-17, on a trip to a local museum for WoCA's Young Art Curators Program: a program developed for young women ages 13-17  to be taught, trained, and given opportunities to explore careers in art/curating/exhibition-making. We hope to offer the program at little to no cost so your contribution will helps us to do it!
3. $1000 to begin a Creative Entrepreneurship program, which invests creative skill development and entrepreneurship training into 10-15 adult women in the local community to create their own supplemental income (i.e., art, jewelry-making, sewing, fashion, home/body products, etc), to fight poverty, and to help develop the local creative economy. The program will support participants by teaching skills in product development, marketing/communications, packaging/display, online store development, and allow participants to sell their products in the WoCA Projects a new WoCA Gift Shop, and at local hand-made market events.
4. $250 Hire to 2-3 teaching artists/creatives to offer affordable courses/workshops to the local community and to support our programs.
5. $500 to offer a modest artist material grant of up to $500 to a local Dallas/Fort Worth artist of color so that they can create new, innovative artwork.
Our #GivingTuesday campaign goal is to raise $2500, which would allow us to fund all of the programs listed above. So the more we raise the more we can do! We are starting with one modest funding goal to support a variety of different projects in hopes that we will build support from the global community to keep these diverse programs going and refine them for the future. So help WoCA make a difference through art and creative practice!
