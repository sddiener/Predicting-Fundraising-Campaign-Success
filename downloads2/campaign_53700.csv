<h3>WHO WE ARE</h3>
<p>The Nest presents También: a new Nest experience and a fresh take on the original classic. También is a love letter to you, our amazing guests. The ones who have stuck with us from day one as well as everyone who has recently discovered their love for breakfast delivery during COVID-19. If you know The Nest, you know there are pain points at our wonderful, little original location; from minimal parking, long wait times for a table (or for pick up), to desperately wanting a mimosa or beer with your Sunday Bacon Waffle while you are out with your people. The good news…También (as we like to call it) was designed with a goal of solving all those pain points for you. Ultimately, we decided to keep foraging ahead even despite the social climate, the pandemic, and all the obstacles we are all dealing with so that we could provide you some hope and not just new normalcy but something dope to look forward to.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>WHY A NEW SPACE?</h3>
<p>We wanted you to be able drive up and park without having to walk blocks, to not have to wait 45-60 minutes for a table, to have outdoor/patio dining options, to grab a drink with your friends and family over a meal or after a long day to unwind. We have heard your feedback and we are so close to opening our doors to be able to continue to provide you with dope food, fresh vibes, and counter cultural service. </p>
<p>Will you partner with us to finalize this dream and help push this project into fruition? We sure hope so, this will be another exciting journey and we need you to be a part of it!</p>

<h3>TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE, LIKE YOU!</h3>
<p>In keeping with our mission, “Taking Care of People,” we ventured to utilize and partner with local vendors, architects, and restaurant specialists to help with the design, planning, and execution of this project. With each of you in mind, we went to the drawing board to create a unique space to house our vision so that we can continue to not only take care of people but to recognize those who have made us who we are. Be on the lookout for the easter eggs that nod to our original location and the cultural and pop cultural elements strategically placed that showcase our diverse customers. </p>
<h3>THE IMPACT/THE OPPORTUNITY</h3>
<p>También is a wonderfully large space (over 3,000 square feet) with great character. This location is housed on the busiest street in Bellflower, CA and is guaranteed to be the place for all your dining needs from brunch to a  quick lunch spot to ultimately a private intimate dinner spot for celebrations. The Nest: También will NOT replace our OG location on Alondra Blvd but will instead offer an alternative experience. You can gather and enjoy an elevated menu with more lifestyle options to suit your changing dietary needs or it can be your place to just grab a mimosa or breakfast cocktail. You’ll be reminded of why you started coming to The Nest in the first place, and also have an opportunity to be a part of the future (both yours and ours together) as we navigate this new day in food and service. </p>

With five different and unique areas in the restaurant, También aims to offer experiences. If you are on the patio you can have an upbeat, lively experience with great music under the southern california sun. If you are at the large, extended thirty seat bar you will feel the breeze from the outside but have more face time with your bartender. If you are in the main area you will get the food hall experience that we are most known for at our current location. We also have a family style dining room off to the side with a huge communal table and an adjacent multi-purpose room that can be closed off or opened up depending on your desires. There might even be a hidden room for private tastings. </p>

<p>Our kitchen space has nearly tripled in size from our cozy kitchen at the OG Nest. A larger kitchen not only means quicker ticket times so that you get your food sooner but also means we have the space and capacity to expand our offerings. With this brand new kitchen we will be able to offer exciting and unique pop-ups, showcase guest chefs, provide outreach to the community through kitchen partnerships, and so much more. One vision we have is for our kitchen to be a female led and run kitchen. It is worth noting that our deepest desire is to have this kitchen run by women of color. When there are so many pain points in today's culture (even within the restaurant industry) pertaining to people of color and especially women of color we cannot think of a better triumph than to help those marginalized to succeed, shape, and lead También.</p>

<h3>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h3>
<p>At the commencement of this funding campaign, the space is 75% complete with the remaining 25% faithfully moving forward in the coming weeks. We are sprinting towards getting open but really wanted to open up a chance for our people to partner with us to finish this project. We have some fantastic perks available for you that are exciting and will provide you exclusive access to The Nest: También and all it’s experiences. We hope you will join us in this next chapter. As always we cannot do it without you. Help partner with us as we continue to take care of people. </p>
<p><strong>OUR ASK:</strong> Help us buy our bar and patio. In order to finalize the bar and patio areas of the restaurant we need to raise $100,000. These funds will go to finalizing the patio space (seating, privacy wall, lighting fixtures), bar space, and securing a full liquor license. We know a major pain point for our guests is not being able to enjoy a glass of champagne, or mimosa, blood mary, or fun breakfast cocktail with their meal. Then you add in the complexities of COVID-19 and outdoor dining is not longer a luxury but a necessity. We want to finish our beverage build out with great fixtures and furniture, awesome counter space, and of course great drinks and selections for you and your friends and family and apply for a full liquor license to enhance your experience even more. This will also allow us to move into a lunch and dinner concept faster. This is one of our last steps and your contribution will go directly to helping us finish the bar and patio areas and get you enjoying a guava mimosa or craft beer on our outdoor patio as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET:</strong></p>
<p>SWAG:</p>
<ul><li>Mugs, pint glasses, special edition t-shirts</li></ul>
<p>RECOGNITION:</p>
<ul><li>Social media shout out, a drink on the menu named after you, your picture on our gallery wall, your name on a table or chair</li></ul>
<p>INSIDER PASSES:</p>
<ul><li>Friends and family soft opening pass with two drink tickets, pick a beer on tap for a 1 month rotation, bartending lesson for two with a También bartender, private cooking class for two with the También chef, free brunch and cocktail for a year, private dinner for 6</li></ul>

<h3>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h3>

One vision we have is for our kitchen to be a female led and run kitchen. It is worth noting that our deepest desire is to have this kitchen run by women of color. When there are so many pain points in today's culture (even within the restaurant industry) pertaining to people of color and especially women of color we cannot think of a better triumph than to help those marginalized to succeed, shape, and lead También.

WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
At the commencement of this funding campaign, the space is 75% complete with the remaining 25% faithfully moving forward in the coming weeks. We are sprinting towards getting open but really wanted to open up a chance for our people to partner with us to finish this project. We have some fantastic perks available for you that are exciting and will provide you exclusive access to The Nest: También and all it’s experiences. We hope you will join us in this next chapter. As always we cannot do it without you. Help partner with us as we continue to take care of people. 
OUR ASK: Help us buy our bar and patio. In order to finalize the bar and patio areas of the restaurant we need to raise $100,000. These funds will go to finalizing the patio space (seating, privacy wall, lighting fixtures), bar space, and securing a full liquor license. We know a major pain point for our guests is not being able to enjoy a glass of champagne, or mimosa, blood mary, or fun breakfast cocktail with their meal. Then you add in the complexities of COVID-19 and outdoor dining is not longer a luxury but a necessity. We want to finish our beverage build out with great fixtures and furniture, awesome counter space, and of course great drinks and selections for you and your friends and family and apply for a full liquor license to enhance your experience even more. This will also allow us to move into a lunch and dinner concept faster. This is one of our last steps and your contribution will go directly to helping us finish the bar and patio areas and get you enjoying a guava mimosa or craft beer on our outdoor patio as soon as possible.
WHAT YOU GET:
SWAG:
Mugs, pint glasses, special edition t-shirts
RECOGNITION:
Social media shout out, a drink on the menu named after you, your picture on our gallery wall, your name on a table or chair
INSIDER PASSES:
Friends and family soft opening pass with two drink tickets, pick a beer on tap for a 1 month rotation, bartending lesson for two with a También bartender, private cooking class for two with the También chef, free brunch and cocktail for a year, private dinner for 6

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey there! We are Miri Plowman and Gabriel Skoda the owners of a food enterprise in Seattle, comprised of Miri's Snack Shack, Miri's Poffertjes and Miri's Catering. We collectively have over <strong>20 years</strong> of experience in the food service industry, and have been in business and <strong>in love</strong> for three years! We are in the process of opening our new venture--a beach cafe located in the heart of Golden Gardens-- one of Seattle's most beautiful parks! The opportunity is so unique-- our cafe will serve the parks attendees with delicious food and beverages and will also<strong> activate</strong> the park through inclusive events that will be fun for the whole family. (Think campfire sing along nights, and puppy brunches!) We are asking for $20,000.00 to help us complete our remodel, create outdoor seating, and market our new space to the public. Please help us open and further our success, so that we can serve this magical place and the people who visit it the best that we can!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are so close! We have renovated the interior including electrical and plumbing, fresh paint (Gabe did most of it!), and the majority of the equipment! However the exterior will be the seriously important component of getting the attention of park goers. Most people who use Golden Gardens are accustomed to there not being a significant eatery here, and we have to really make our presence KNOWN to get the attention of the public!</p>
<p><strong>Seating</strong>: Outdoor seating that can be easily moved but sturdy enough to last and to not get stolen. ($4k) </p>
<p><strong>Signage/branding</strong>: We are in the process of redoing our logo ($2k), and once this is complete we will design a sign for the exterior ($2k) and have our sign hung ($500.00). In addition we'll need marketing materials like posters, postcards, sandwich boards ($1+k).</p>
<p><strong>Planters and beautification</strong>: Planters have to be sturdy enough to withhold the wind and tricksters that may try to tip it over or drag them to the ocean! (1k)</p>
<p><strong>Walk-in Refrigerator</strong>: The refrigerator is ($5.5k) hardwiring the fridge ($1k)</p>
<p><strong>Marketing/events</strong>: As we open, we would like to reach as many different groups of people as possible to increase our visibility and ensure our success. This means spending money on marketing and events that will engage varying sectors of the public. This last 4k is money that will go directly back into community events that activate park and the space around the concession. Examples include: A Grand Opening Party, Sponsoring Bonfires, Sponsoring Musicians/Face-painters/Yoga and fitness instructors to offer free classes for the public, and more! </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll still be able to do a great deal on this list accomplished! We're asking for this money to ensure that we open with as much support and potential for success as possible. Because let's be honest, opening a food establishment is risky! The margins are small, and the first year is the hardest. This money will also allow us to <b>HIRE </b>sooner, which will allow us to retain the revenue streams that we already have in place. We're hoping to put as many cards in our favor as we can so that we might continue to be the stewards of Golden Gardens and help activate the park for many years to come. If we make MORE than we need through this campaign the funds will be solely used for creating even more events and programming for the public.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Opening a business in a Seattle Public Park poses numerous opportunities to intersect environment, culture and community. In opening our small concession at Golden Gardens our goal is to:</p>
<p>-<strong>SERVE</strong>: All people that enjoy the park with equality, respect and joy.</p>
<p>-<strong>PROVIDE</strong>: High quality, affordable, and thoughtful food and drinks that accommodate cultural, socioeconomic and dietary needs.</p>
<p>-<strong>CREATE</strong>: Inclusive events that draw from the varied needs the community and encourages people from all parts of the city and beyond to utilize, adore and develop memories in this magnificent park.</p>
<p>-<strong>STEWARD</strong>: Golden Gardens and The Salish Sea through conscious packaging and limited plastic and single use products in our venue. </p>
<p>-<strong>COLLABORATE</strong>: With non profit organizations and businesses that are also passionate about Golden Gardens, Seattle's Public Spaces, The Great Outdoors, and Free and family focused activities.</p>
<p>-<strong>SUPPORT: </strong>Local and sustainable agriculture and other local small producers through purchasing power.</p>
<p>In the end, I still believe that the entrepreneurial spirit has the potential to move forward causes of social and environmental justice. It is our intention to be an exemplar of this ethos. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Gabe and I have been in business for over 3 years. In those three years we have made calculated moves, growing our business slowly and intentionally. We have managed until now to take on no debt for our business, and operate at a profit. We have done this by maintaining low overhead and few employees, and many a 100+ hour work week. </p>
<p>In this new step we will hire multiple employees, have higher monthly overhead, and take some of the ""mobile flexibility"" out of our business. Labor and overhead costs are expensive, but also allow us an opportunity to grow. Our ability to adapt has served us well over the years and will continue to do so. In addition, we are maintaining previous revenue streams while also increasing our capacity to generate income through the busy summer months at Golden Gardens. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We acknowledge that not everyone has the financial means to support our business in this way. In addition, there are so many brilliant ideas, causes and struggles vying for financial resources, how do you choose what you can and can't support! We believe that if you are supporting causes that are important to you then you are also vicariously supporting our cause! So thank you, and you do you!</p>
<p>Please still join us in celebration at our May 12th celebration, and any other event we sponsor or host!</p>
<p>Please like, follow and share our Crowdfunding Campaign and our Grand Opening with those that may be excited about our project or would like to collaborate with us.</p>
<p>Please just send us some positive juju as we dive into this new adventure head first! </p>

<p>I’m Tom Coughlan, the chef and owner of Lunch Different; a direct-to-office catering company I’m working to start in New York City. I need your help to get started and that’s why I’m reaching out here on Indiegogo. There is no such thing as a free lunch and I need money to get my business started.</p>
<p>Lunch at the office is often rushed, impersonal and unhealthy. The choices are leftovers, something quick, something cheap, or something bad for you and no one has time for a full week of meal prep. So usually it becomes some mix of all these. But as more companies are buying their employees lunch they are finding an improvement in company culture and productivity along with a satiated staff. People get the chance to engage with their fellow employees in an unforced social environment and share in humankind's oldest tradition, a meal.</p>
<p>Lunch Different will target the emerging market of employer purchased office lunches with local, seasonal and healthy options. This is not lunch catered by Shake Shack. This is real food, prepared by an experienced chef and delivered directly to the office to be enjoyed.</p>
<p>I’ve been a chef in New York City for over six years, working at various establishments ranging from small cafes to Michelin starred restaurants. Last year I opened Sunken Hundred as the executive chef and received high praise from the local and national food press. But I am leaving the restaurant scene behind to focus on Lunch Different and bring lunch right to your office.</p>
<p>In order to get started I am asking for $8000 to cover my startup costs. In return I’m offering some great and unique perks for those that donate.</p>
<p>Please donate now and I hope to see you for lunch soon!</p>

<h2>Crystal Clear Ice Maker Molds</h2>
<p>Whether your favorite refreshment is iced coffee or adult beverage, <strong>once you go clear you will never go back to ordinary ice</strong>. There are many cocktail ice makers on the market but only a few that actually make relatively clear ice. Having purchased these products and encountering one defect disappointment or another, I set out to perfect the clear ice mold. Clear ice won't actually make your cocktail taste better, but it sure seems that way! </p>
<p>Don't <strong>ruin the enjoyment</strong> of your fine iced coffee or premium bourbon whiskey brand by using cloudy ice! A single, oversized ice ball in your cocktail slows down the melting process and won't dilute your cocktail as fast as ordinary ice.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615319219/z01v5xipcyzwbil58l3o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The design goal with the <i><strong>TuVuoi</strong></i> (pronounced <i><strong>'two-voy'</strong></i>, Italian for <strong><u>You Want</u></strong>) ice mold is to make the <strong>largest and clearest ice possible</strong>. By studying the other brand ice makers I was able to improve the quality and performance of the ice mold. Many of these other brands even use fake ice in their advertising photos to make you think their molds produce ice which is clearer than it actually is! After 6 months of design, prototyping, and testing, I have created the best clear cocktail ice freezer molds possible. <strong>Every picture I use is of actual ice from the mold!</strong></p>
<h3>The Top-Down Freeze Method</h3>
<p>As ice freezes in a typical ice tray, it creates air pockets inside the ice which will make the ice appear cloudy. To create clear ice, the freeze process must be carefully controlled by insulating the ice mold on all sides except the top. This forces the ice to form <strong>from the top down</strong>.</p>
<p>Don't be fooled by those other ice molds that claim to make clear ice. There is <strong>only one way</strong> to make clear ice from a freezer mold and any ice mold that does not also contain an insulated reservoir surrounding the ice mold will not make crystal clear ice, no matter how pure your water is!</p>
<p>Much like a lake freezes in winter, as the ice freezes from the top down our ice maker pushes the air bubbles into the reservoir beneath the actual cavity in the ice mold. This leaves the ice to form inside the mold cavity with as few flaws in <strong>clarity and purity as possible</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615319248/vkjlwt3aps3xsoxeuaqn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Removing as many air bubbles as possible while the ice freezes will produce a <strong>near perfectly clear ice shape</strong>. A single, large and flawless ice shape is less likely to crack and break apart than cloudy ice which contains air pockets, spoiling your enjoyment.</p>
<p>I set out to perfect the top-down freeze method with the <i><strong>TuVuoi</strong></i> line of ice molds. I purchased every style of insulated clear ice maker on the market and after testing them all, I felt we could improve those designs to make the best ice maker possible.</p>
<h3>About <i>TuVuoi</i>
</h3>

<h3>Choose From Five Different Ice Molds</h3>
<p>Share your passions with your friends over a cocktail with specialty ice. I will offer ice molds to make a <strong>golf ball, a large round sphere, a d20 board game dice, a 6-sided craps dice, or a diamond shaped ice.</strong></p>
<p><u><i><strong>We can even make a custom ice shape on special order.</strong></i></u></p>

<h3>How To Make Clear Cocktail Ice</h3>
<p>Tap water can vary in quality from location to location. After using our ice maker and you are still experiencing some cloudiness in your ice, <strong>try experimenting</strong> with different water purity, warm water (not boiling!), freezer time, and increase your freezer temperature to about +10 Degrees F to slow the freezing cycle even more.</p>
<p>Simply fill the reservoir with your favorite water, allow it to sit to let any bubbles escape, then slowly lower the ice molds into the reservoir. Place in the freezer for 24-36 hours and remove the ice and place into your favorite refreshment!</p>
<p>Check out the extra images for detailed instructions.</p>

<p>The <i><strong>TuVuoi</strong></i> ice maker is comprised only of top quality materials. The custom vacuum insulated tumbler is made from top quality 304 stainless steel, the insulation sleeve is made from neoprene foam, and the molds are made from <strong>FDA approved, BPA and Phthalates</strong> free silicone rubber. </p>
<p>Each component of the <i><strong>TuVuoi</strong></i> ice maker is <strong>machine washable and fully recyclable</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","Crystal Clear Ice Maker Molds
Whether your favorite refreshment is iced coffee or adult beverage, once you go clear you will never go back to ordinary ice. There are many cocktail ice makers on the market but only a few that actually make relatively clear ice. Having purchased these products and encountering one defect disappointment or another, I set out to perfect the clear ice mold. Clear ice won't actually make your cocktail taste better, but it sure seems that way! 
Don't ruin the enjoyment of your fine iced coffee or premium bourbon whiskey brand by using cloudy ice! A single, oversized ice ball in your cocktail slows down the melting process and won't dilute your cocktail as fast as ordinary ice.

The design goal with the TuVuoi (pronounced 'two-voy', Italian for You Want) ice mold is to make the largest and clearest ice possible. By studying the other brand ice makers I was able to improve the quality and performance of the ice mold. Many of these other brands even use fake ice in their advertising photos to make you think their molds produce ice which is clearer than it actually is! After 6 months of design, prototyping, and testing, I have created the best clear cocktail ice freezer molds possible. Every picture I use is of actual ice from the mold!
The Top-Down Freeze Method
As ice freezes in a typical ice tray, it creates air pockets inside the ice which will make the ice appear cloudy. To create clear ice, the freeze process must be carefully controlled by insulating the ice mold on all sides except the top. This forces the ice to form from the top down.
Don't be fooled by those other ice molds that claim to make clear ice. There is only one way to make clear ice from a freezer mold and any ice mold that does not also contain an insulated reservoir surrounding the ice mold will not make crystal clear ice, no matter how pure your water is!
Much like a lake freezes in winter, as the ice freezes from the top down our ice maker pushes the air bubbles into the reservoir beneath the actual cavity in the ice mold. This leaves the ice to form inside the mold cavity with as few flaws in clarity and purity as possible.

Removing as many air bubbles as possible while the ice freezes will produce a near perfectly clear ice shape. A single, large and flawless ice shape is less likely to crack and break apart than cloudy ice which contains air pockets, spoiling your enjoyment.
I set out to perfect the top-down freeze method with the TuVuoi line of ice molds. I purchased every style of insulated clear ice maker on the market and after testing them all, I felt we could improve those designs to make the best ice maker possible.
About TuVuoi


Choose From Five Different Ice Molds
Share your passions with your friends over a cocktail with specialty ice. I will offer ice molds to make a golf ball, a large round sphere, a d20 board game dice, a 6-sided craps dice, or a diamond shaped ice.
We can even make a custom ice shape on special order.
The Golf Ball Ice Maker

The 6-Sided 'Craps"" Dice Ice Maker

The d20 Board Game Dice Ice Maker

The Largest Sphere Ice Maker

The Diamond Ice Maker

How To Make Clear Cocktail Ice
Tap water can vary in quality from location to location. After using our ice maker and you are still experiencing some cloudiness in your ice, try experimenting with different water purity, warm water (not boiling!), freezer time, and increase your freezer temperature to about +10 Degrees F to slow the freezing cycle even more.
Simply fill the reservoir with your favorite water, allow it to sit to let any bubbles escape, then slowly lower the ice molds into the reservoir. Place in the freezer for 24-36 hours and remove the ice and place into your favorite refreshment!
Check out the extra images for detailed instructions.
What Comes In The Clear Ice Maker Kit

The TuVuoi ice maker is comprised only of top quality materials. The custom vacuum insulated tumbler is made from top quality 304 stainless steel, the insulation sleeve is made from neoprene foam, and the molds are made from FDA approved, BPA and Phthalates free silicone rubber. 
Each component of the TuVuoi ice maker is machine washable and fully recyclable.

<p>We would love to be able to ship customized portions of Winecream across the country, and even the globe - but we're not there yet. We hope to offer direct-to-consumer shipping to select U.S. locations in 2015, but can't make any promises (and for this campaign, perks that include Winecream can only be redeemed in-person). For now, our product can only be purchased at select food and wine festivals in the Mid-Atlantic region.

Or, contribute to this campaign to help us get our storefront up and running!</p>
<h4><i>Do I have to be of legal drinking age to eat Winecream?</i></h4>
<p>Yes, because the product contains approximately 10% alcohol by volume, customers must be 21+ to enjoy. We check for a valid photo ID for all sales and samples. but don't worry - as a consolation prize we offer ""virgin"" concoctions for younger fans until they're old enough to enjoy the real thing.</p>

We want to give back to the Vegan Community and we believe this is the best way to do so. We've felt nothing but l<u>ove and support</u> and we want to pay that forward. <br/><br/>I (Ryan) had the pleasure of creating Vegan Pizzas at Wegmans for my fellow Vegans. Now that my time has come to an end at Wegmans, it only made sense to start our very own pizzeria. During this time, we have been perfecting our recipes at home. Also, during the month of February, I will be enrolled in the Worlds <strong>FIRST</strong> Vegan Pizza school, which will allow us to bring worldly varieties and flavors to our menu! <br/><br/>I (Emily) am grateful for all of the positive life changes that have happened for me since adopting a plant-based diet. I have always felt a true passion for making people happy through their stomachs! In my spare time I am constantly working on new creative recipes to serve at our pizzeria and even concurring gluten sensitive options.  My background, though not in food service, is strong in marketing and advertising. My career is rich in music entertainment and radio.  This has inspired us to theme our creations after vegan-musicians who spread the word of a more compassionate world. Won't you come try a slice of the ""Wu Wisdom"" or ""Thirty Seconds to Parm?""<br/><br/>We cannot wait to bring you the Vegan Pizza you deserve!<br/><br/><strong><u>Why This Campaign Is Important to Us -</u></strong> This campaign will allow us to further the process of getting the pizzeria up and running! We have both been Vegan for a year and we feel completely at home within the Vegan Community. Creating pizzas for our fellow Vegans brings us a tremendous amount of joy. We will be looking to collaborate with other Plant Based entrepreneurs in WNY, as well as Non-For Profits. Everyone has an emotional attachment to pizza. When you adopt a plant based life-style, that desire for pizza as a comfort food does't go away. We want to provide the community pizzas that they'll fall in love with. <br/><br/><strong>Pizza for Earthlings, not made of Earthlings.</strong><br/>We're so grateful for your support, it truly means the world.<br/>Without <strong>YOU</strong>, there is no <strong>US</strong>​. <br/> </p>

<h3>About The Sauce &amp; Me</h3>
<p>As a home cook who has always loved hot sauce, I was starting to get annoyed with the constant bombarding of gross-tasting heat in all these gimmicky sauces! All heat, no flavor and NEVER would you consider putting them on food.</p>
<p>I wanted something with flavor, depth, controlled and natural heat and a combination of flavors that hit different spots on the tongue. SO, my hot sauce was born!! </p>
<p>Tropical Coffee Habanero is a blend of Mango, Espresso grounds and Habanero peppers! With all-natural ingredients, the sauce is 100% vegan and gluten-free.  </p>
<p>The sauce has been APPROVED by the Cornell Food Lab as shelf-stable and safe!</p>
<p>My goal is to make food that has ingredients you can pronounce, flavors you recognize and love, and no hesitancy due to lack of knowledge of these crazy ingredients other sauces use. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Funding &amp; Rewards</h3>
<p>The funding that I am seeking is ONLY for the cost of health department inspections, courses, certifications, and licenses. ALL the things that NY makes you go through when you make a hot sauce. This money would allow me to be able to start selling online, at farmer's markets and to stores &amp; restaurants. </p>
<p><strong>ANY DONATION AMOUNT IS WELCOME!</strong></p>
<p>What you will get: </p>
<ul>
<li>$10+ higher pledge - 5oz bottle of Hot Sauce</li>
<li>$25+ pledge - 3 of the 5 oz bottles of Hot Sauce</li>
<li>$50+ Pledge - Personalized Bottle of Sauce with One-of-a-kind Label</li>
<li>$100+ or more - 5 of the 5oz bottle of Hot Sauce AND a LIFETIME 30% discount on future bottles</li>
</ul>
<p>I am only asking for the funds for licenses. I am not looking for everyone to fund this company, I want people to be able to still get my sauce in some way while I go through the rigorous and extensive process that NY state requires when you make something this acidic! </p>
<p>This is a chance for you to support an independent business that could grow exponentially, and a chance for me to continue sharing my passion for good, clean and natural foods with the world!</p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>Vegan Armenian Kitchen is a collaborative project between Lena, a vegan cook and writer based in Toronto, and Siroon, a photographer and creative director based in Los Angeles. They met in Armenia in 2012, and reunited in Los Angeles six years later to set the wheels in motion for this endeavor. After living in Armenia for six years, Lena is on a mission to not only veganize the Armenian dishes she grew up with, but also highlight the plant-based staples present in both Armenia and the diaspora. Siroon, with her unique vision and style, is passionately bringing the recipes, stories, and the cookbook itself to life.</p>
<p>Integral components of Armenian dining include abundance, generosity and a love of food. Vegan Armenian Kitchen will showcase that it is possible to cut down or eliminate animal product consumption while still being able to enjoy Armenian classics.</p>
<p>While the recipes are the main component of this venture, Vegan Armenian Kitchen is an all-in-one resource for Armenian cooking which is intertwined with its rich culture and heritage. From food idioms and detailed explanations on dishes, names and customs, to pantry staples, menu pairing and holiday planning, Vegan Armenian Kitchen will be an invaluable tool that will serve not only to educate and fascinate readers on Armenian cuisine and history, but also inspire them to create the plant-based and veganized dishes in their own kitchen!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are pouring our hearts and souls into research, content creation, recipe writing and testing, collecting stories, photographing, and creating videos -- the majority of which is done apart from each other, with occasional travel to our respective cities as well as to Armenia. Our goal is to raise $18,000 in order to cover the costs of publishing, designing and printing 1500 high-quality hardcover cookbooks, which include approximately 250 pages filled with stories, photos and recipes.</p>
<p>We will be donating a portion of proceeds from each cookbook to Centaur, the only animal-assisted hippotherapy center in Armenia, that also operates as a rescue horse and dog shelter. More information on Centaur can be found below.</p>
<p>We also have a wide variety of exciting perks for our special backers! They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A signed copy of the cookbook as soon as it’s available</li>
<li>An Armenia-themed tote bag</li>
<li>The ability to participate in a vote on which dishes from the cookbook become video recipes</li>
<li>Your name/business thanked in cookbook (if desired)</li>
<li>An invite to our book signing party for Vegan Armenian Kitchen</li>
<li>Promotional perks (for sponsors)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While the cookbook is intentionally made up of both authentically plant-based dishes and veganized classics, our cookbook is for everyone--vegan or not, Armenian or not. Whether you are vegetarian, pescetarian, reducetarian, lactose-intolerant, observing Lent, or just looking to add some life into your plant-based dishes, Vegan Armenian Kitchen is the cookbook for you.</p>
<p>The preorder and sale of each cookbook also guarantees a donation to Centaur Animal-Assisted Therapy &amp; Rescue Center.</p>

<p>Centaur Animal-Assisted Therapy &amp; Rescue Center was established in 2008 by Hasmik Hovhannisyan in Ushi, Armenia. Since its opening, the center has provided treatment for over 1000 people and rescued over 400 animals.</p>
<p>It is a one-of-a-kind place where stray animals and those that are in danger are rescued and trained for animal-assisted therapy (AAT). The team at Centaur teaches them that humans are their friends, and for some it takes years — due to extremely bad experiences in the past. And vice-versa: the dogs of Centaur professionally treat cynophobia (fear of dogs) in both children and adults.</p>
<p><i>“Therapeutic dogs help children with autism thrive by entering a relationship where they become naturally responsible for the well-being of their furry friend. People with cerebral palsy benefit from our horses: within a few first hippotherapy sessions, the physical and mental condition of most people improve.”</i></p>
<p>Today the goal is to educate new therapists — both furry &amp; two-legged alike — and make AAT more accessible in Armenia by partnering with more rehabilitation &amp; crisis centers and orphanages. To do this, Centaur has partnered up with Orphans &amp; Their Dogs, PeaceCorps and PAWS Armenia and has launched collaborative projects. All donations to Centaur convert into food, training and daily care for therapy animals.</p>

<p>Cocao growers and their families get paid less than 2 dollars per day.  This does not allow children in these communities to afford an education, or families to develop a greater style of life.  Cocoa Crate is looking to change this by buying our beans at a higher cost directly from Co-Ops that we have helped set up.  We are also working closely with the Equitable Trade Fund to give a percentage of each sale back to the farmers.  Through the Equitable Trade fund, we are helping to build schools, and train farmers in the agricultural skills they need to increase cocao yields.  By purchasing a Cocoa Crate subscription, you are directly helping the farmers who have helped bring this incredible chocolate to your doors!</p>

<h3>I started making pasta for girls' night.</h3>
<p>I grew up helping my <i>nonna</i> Josephine (grandmother, in Italian) make pasta for special meals like Easter and Christmas.  Now I make it for the girls when I have them over for dinner.  Friends love my innovative pasta and joked about me starting my own business (being unemployed at the time).</p>
<p>Then I started researching and found out that there is a need for a pasta to shake up the category.  Bloom Pasta was born.  I've verified product fit by interviewing 100+ potential consumers and food professionals about my product.  I wrote a business plan and a pitch deck. I spoke with packaging companies and frozen food manufacturers. </p>
<p>Now it's time to move to the next stage and start producing large amounts of samples - that is, to move up from hand-rolling and hand-cranking, to upgraded kitchen products that use electricity and motors to accomplish the same tasks in less time!</p>
<h3>What Your Contribution Means</h3>
</div><div><p>Your contribution will help me begin prototyping - making samples to finalize my recipe development, for focus groups, and for marketing events.  Your contributions will be used to build my ""starter kit"" of mixers, scales, mixing bowls, and other items needed to start this business.</p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Bloom Pasta is a startup, but has a vision of how it will give back to the community once it's underway.  Bloom Pasta will be a manufacturing facility located in an underserved community in Broward County, Florida.  My dream is to  employ locals from that community by providing them an option within walking distance.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>This is Only the Starting Point</h3>
<p>This equipment is part of my earliest activities as a startup business.  My plan is to move into a commercial kitchen space once I have some momentum.   This equipment will help me get those initial orders!  </p>

<h3>My Love of All Things Chile Pepper (and my cat, Izzy)</h3>My mom's family is from the town of Clarksburg in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and they've been farming in the area for 6 generations - almost 160 years. Mom was adamant that we learn how to grow our own food, that we knew where our food came from, and that we ate well. I have been gardening since I was old enough to walk and carry small tools. Chile peppers have always been a big part of my gardening. My first love was chile rellenos that my mom made for us at the end of the season. Of course, as I grew up my chile pepper horizons expanded and my addiction to all things hot and spicy led to a love of hot sauces.<br/><br/>I've been making salsas for a few years and now I want to turn those into hot sauces. The contributions from this campaign will help me buy the equipment I need to get started, refine my recipes, search for the best quality, locally-available sources for my ingredients, and help pay for some of my branding.<br/><br/>If the R&amp;D phase goes well, I will have the tools I need to launch my company. This is an exciting time to be starting a food business in Sacramento. I would look for every opportunity to partner with local growers who grow organically and sustainably and with local businesses who support the local Sacramento food scene.<br/> </div><div>
<h3>What You Are Funding</h3>
<p>You may well ask, ""Where is my money going?"" You would be funding several things. </p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment - I need buckets for bottling and fermenting, bottles, caps, and labels. I will also need an immersion blender and assorted small kitchen tools. I will also need smoking boxes and wood chips for smoking chile peppers. Yes, some of my recipes will include smoked chiles!</li>
<li>Recipe development - I already have two fully conceived recipes that are ready to be transformed into sauces. The first is an habanero, pineapple, mango pico de gallo based on a traditional recipe from the Caribbean! The second is my take on a traditional Mexican style hot sauce with cascabel, roasted poblano, and Fresno chiles with a tomatillo base. All of this recipe R&amp;D means lots of ingredients!</li>
<li>Conceptual artwork - Everyone who has purchased artisan hot sauce knows that artwork and label design is important. I'm going to be hiring a friend of mine to design my company logo and help with my label design. The company logo will feature a cartoon of my cat, Izzy! It will be ready to go when the company launches! </li>
</ul>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>PERKS! - Some of what you are funding will go directly into your perks.</p>
<ul>
<li>All contributors will be invited to a tasting at Burly Beverages Gift Shoppe &amp; Tasting Room in Sacramento, CA. I will be working a chef friend of mine to develop great hot sauce pairings.</li>
<li>Contributors of $20 or more will receive the tasting plus at least one 2 oz. bottle of hot sauce.</li>
<li>Contributors of $50 or more will receive the tasting plusat least one 5 oz. bottle of hot sauce.</li>
<li>For contributors who are unable to attend the tasting:<ul>
<li>At the $10-20 level, I will ship two 2 oz. bottles of hot sauce.</li>
<li>At the $20-50 level, I will ship two 5 oz. bottles of hot sauce.</li>
<li>At the $50+ level, I will ship four 5 oz. bottles of hot sauce.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Support Dizzy Izzy's?</h3>
<p>You would be helping me fulfill a lifelong dream to make hot sauces that I can market in Northern California, and maybe even beyond! I would also be committed to seeking out local growers and supporting their missions to provide the best quality, fresh ingredients to the Sacramento region and Northern California.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>There is very little risk in contributing. If I don't make at least $100, Indiegogo returns the funds to you. If I receive $100-200, I will realistically be able to provide a tasting at Burly Beverages Gift Shoppe &amp; Tasting Room. At the $200-300 funding level, I should be able to provide the tasting and ship bottles of sauce to those who can't attend. At $300+, I should be able to meet all of my perks with no issues.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

src=""""/></strong></p><p>Less than a year ago in December 2019, I popped up a 6-foot fold up table and crossed my fingers…nervous doesn’t even begin to describe how I felt, I slept two hours the night before.  I didn’t know if anyone would show up honestly, this was a new concept in town and after all, what did I know, I was a civil engineer by day, student by night, and spent what little time I had obsessing over my new found hobby: cookies (not baking, literally only cookies, I don’t know how to bake anything else really).</p><p>Fast forward 3 months and we had 6 successful pop-ups under our belt!  We broke the North Market pop-up record on our first day there and each time we went back we kept breaking our own record, it was so exciting, I felt like we had a bright future ahead of us, it was just a matter of time.  I say we because by this time I had 3 part-time employees that helped me make dough one night a week, all of whom are still a part of the team today; pretty cool right?</p><p>Then, things changed.  COVID-19 hit, businesses shut down, people got laid off, mandatory quarantine, <u>no more pop-ups</u>.  At first I figured we’d wait it out and pop-up again when possible.  But some of those layoffs affected my employees as well.  Two of my employees lost their other jobs and they asked me if there was anything I could do to keep them busy…this is the turning point in the short but exciting story that is Lion Cub’s Cookies.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601844435/jwnrylr0hzaiblxh9kkd.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Two days later (yes, all of two days of planning went into this), I had an idea to keep them busy: delivery.  I stayed up until 2 or 3 am each night planning how we could pull this off, I was exhausted from my day job, but I was determined.  I viewed this not only as an opportunity to help them out, but also to show them that I actually cared about them, they were more than just employees to me, and I wanted to show them they could always trust me to act in their best interests, something that will benefit us for years to come. </p><p>The early days were rough, we did everything manual, from taking orders, to collecting payments, to planning routes, you name it.  But we grew and adapted, we got better everyday, constantly changing how we did things until we found what worked best, and eventually with the help of technology we were able to grow delivery way faster than I ever thought!  We went from doing deliveries one day a week, to two, then three, then we started hitting the suburbs too.  Before I knew it, we grew from a team of 4 to a team of 11 in a matter of months. </p><p>Our growth over the last couple months has been exhilarating, and I don’t ever take for granted what we’ve been able to do together over the past year.  There weren’t too many bright spots in our country in 2020 but here we are, a start-up with the most humble beginnings, growing amidst a global pandemic, putting smiles on peoples faces, keeping people employed, and staying true to who we are the whole time. </p><p>What we’ve done to this point will always be a part of who we are, but we have so much more left to do.  We have so much more left to achieve, and we are now ready and eager to take the next step with you: we want to open up our very first store front, <strong>we’re ready for a new home</strong>. </p><p style=""text-align:

Fort (a shared production kitchen) has been great to us, and has allowed us to grow as much as we could, but we’re ready for more…and  we think we’ve found a perfect home, and we want you to be part of this, we want to build this together.  You’ve been such a huge part of what we’ve done to this point we didn’t see any other way than to do this together.</p><p>When I say together, I truly mean that.  It refers to not just me and the rest of the Lion Cub’s team, but the community that has formed around us and rallied to support us: you.  What you have done and meant to me alone, I honestly can’t put into words without getting emotional in some way.  You’ve allowed me to chase a dream of mine now, and you’ve allowed me to do it in all the right ways. </p><p style=""text-align:

year ago in December 2019, Lion Cub’s Cookies has grown faster than even we could have predicted, and is becoming another one of Columbus’ own, storied, beloved brands.  What started as a guy behind a fold up table, has blossomed to a team of 11, serving tens of thousands of cookies, all in less than a year, a crazy year at that to say the least.We’re still a very young company, but we’re growing up right in front of your eyes, and we’re now ready to take the next step: we are ready for a new home, a home we invite you to help us build.  Your contributions will allow us to finally be readily available to any and all who want to experience Lion Cub’s Cookies.  To this point we’ve done our best to reach as many people as possible while operating out of a shared commissary kitchen, and we’ve done all we can.  But, to take the next step and to finally be able to spread the cookie love, we need to do this, and we’ve never been more excited to do so.Our new home will be at 1261 Grandview Ave. in Grandview Heights, right next to a couple other Columbus beloved brands: Jeni’s, Staufs, Grandview Café…the fit seems so perfect, we can’t wait, and we hope you will contribute to this campaign and build our new home with us. We’re hoping to raise $40,000 to help pay for the equipment in our new space!  We should have enough to cover the construction costs but we need your help to make our home complete and functional! The space we’re moving into is going to get an incredible makeover, it’s going to look, feel, and have the aroma of space that you can be proud of.  In return for your generous contributions, we have a range of rewards we hope will make you feel like you’re getting something neat in return, we think we have something for everyone in here.  Our perks range from cookies, to dough making parties, to swag that comes with lifetime discounts associated with it!    Once we move into our new home in Grandview Heights, we plan to have a space that everyone is welcome in, no matter who you are, where you’re from, what you believe in.  This will be a space where everyone can enjoy themselves and get the best cookies on the planet. This space will finally be a space where people can come say hi to us, and get cookies when it is most convenient for them, their friends, and their families.  We also plan to continue building out our delivery service once in this space, as that has become part of who we are and we know how much many of you appreciate us doing that.  The way in which we approach delivery may change, we hope to become more advanced and more readily available here.  This space will allow to us to shed the limitations we faced in our previous space, and we're so excited about that.  We understand not everyone has the ability to contribute to this campaign by buying perks and that's ok!  What would be awesome for anyone though, whether buying perks or not, would be to simply spread the word!  Tell all your friends, share our story with them, tell them who we are and let them know what we're trying to accomplish with this campaign!  Also, if you or your friends aren't already, we highly recommend you follow on us IG/Facebook @lioncubscookies!  Less than a year ago in December 2019, I popped up a 6-foot fold up table and crossed my fingers…nervous doesn’t even begin to describe how I felt, I slept two hours the night before.  I didn’t know if anyone would show up honestly, this was a new concept in town and after all, what did I know, I was a civil engineer by day, student by night, and spent what little time I had obsessing over my new found hobby: cookies (not baking, literally only cookies, I don’t know how to bake anything else really).Fast forward 3 months and we had 6 successful pop-ups under our belt!  We broke the North Market pop-up record on our first day there and each time we went back we kept breaking our own record, it was so exciting, I felt like we had a bright future ahead of us, it was just a matter of time.  I say we because by this time I had 3 part-time employees that helped me make dough one night a week, all of whom are still a part of the team today; pretty cool right?Then, things changed.  COVID-19 hit, businesses shut down, people got laid off, mandatory quarantine, no more pop-ups.  At first I figured we’d wait it out and pop-up again when possible.  But some of those layoffs affected my employees as well.  Two of my employees lost their other jobs and they asked me if there was anything I could do to keep them busy…this is the turning point in the short but exciting story that is Lion Cub’s Cookies.Two days later (yes, all of two days of planning went into this), I had an idea to keep them busy: delivery.  I stayed up until 2 or 3 am each night planning how we could pull this off, I was exhausted from my day job, but I was determined.  I viewed this not only as an opportunity to help them out, but also to show them that I actually cared about them, they were more than just employees to me, and I wanted to show them they could always trust me to act in their best interests, something that will benefit us for years to come. The early days were rough, we did everything manual, from taking orders, to collecting payments, to planning routes, you name it.  But we grew and adapted, we got better everyday, constantly changing how we did things until we found what worked best, and eventually with the help of technology we were able to grow delivery way faster than I ever thought!  We went from doing deliveries one day a week, to two, then three, then we started hitting the suburbs too.  Before I knew it, we grew from a team of 4 to a team of 11 in a matter of months. Our growth over the last couple months has been exhilarating, and I don’t ever take for granted what we’ve been able to do together over the past year.  There weren’t too many bright spots in our country in 2020 but here we are, a start-up with the most humble beginnings, growing amidst a global pandemic, putting smiles on peoples faces, keeping people employed, and staying true to who we are the whole time. What we’ve done to this point will always be a part of who we are, but we have so much more left to do.  We have so much more left to achieve, and we are now ready and eager to take the next step with you: we want to open up our very first store front, we’re ready for a new home. Our current home, The Food Fort (a shared production kitchen) has been great to us, and has allowed us to grow as much as we could, but we’re ready for more…and  we think we’ve found a perfect home, and we want you to be part of this, we want to build this together.  You’ve been such a huge part of what we’ve done to this point we didn’t see any other way than to do this together.When I say together, I truly mean that.  It refers to not just me and the rest of the Lion Cub’s team, but the community that has formed around us and rallied to support us: you.  What you have done and meant to me alone, I honestly can’t put into words without getting emotional in some way.  You’ve allowed me to chase a dream of mine now, and you’ve allowed me to do it in all the right ways. I could go on and on about this but I want you all to know regardless of the future of this company, this will be a chapter in my life I never forget, the first time in my life I felt like I was living with a purpose.  My purpose now is to continue to build something with you that we can all be proud of.  By donating to this campaign you are taking a stake in what we’re building together, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.Cheers to the future.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Good cold brewed coffee can take up to 12 hours to make. With FrankOne it is possible to prepare exceptional cold brewed coffee in as little as 4 minutes. Our Vacuum Extraction Technology™ accelerates the process by forcing cold water through finely ground coffee. We ourselves were surprised to try such a strong yet smooth cup made in so little time.</p>

Our Vacuum Extraction Technology™ accelerates the process by forcing cold water through finely ground coffee. We ourselves were surprised to try such a strong yet smooth cup made in so little time.
 

 
 


FrankOne pulls enough pressure that it is possible to make a shot very similar to espresso. It gives a kick, is sweet, and very intense. 
 


FrankOne has a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other manual brewers: our patented Vacuum Extraction Technology™ uses negative pressure to force water through a bed of ground coffee, extracting more of the flavors that coffee has to offer, while reducing bitterness. Our patented method generates pressure that is strong enough to allow brewing with any grind size; from very fine to very coarse. Different grind sizes mean the possibility of preparing a wide range of brew types and cup profiles–from coffee to cold brew, all with the same machine.
Our patented technology also provides superior convenience and ease of use: press a button and your coffee is ready in seconds.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>What ""The Basement"" will be is a safe haven for all things nerdy. This is the place to go knowing that there won't be any sports on TV or a loud band to interrupt, or worry about being made fun of for being openly a nerd. We hope to create a space that is officially and overtly intended to be everyone's nerdy basement away from home! Movie, Game and TV premieres, Comic Book events, Craft Beverages, Retro Arcade and Console games, Tabletop games, Esports Tournaments, like minded customers and staff to meet and make friends with, the list goes on and on about all of the things this bar is going to have, but the biggest, coolest thing we plan on having is you.</p>
<p>All of these things and events are cool but our focus is going to be dedicated on just having an atmosphere that is relaxed and open enough that any nerd can feel comfortable and enjoy themselves even during events about things they're not familiar with. TVs and Music will be kept at a good volume for conversation, we'll make every effort to make everything we do inclusive, and ensure the space is pleasant and comfortable for everyone there.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We don't need a whole lot in comparison to other starting bars. We're literally going into the basement of an established bar (The Distillery on Heatherdowns) in Toledo, but it's running independent of the bar above it, so we need to raise funds to set the place up and stock it. We're donating a lot of our own time and funds to make our Geekeasy a reality, and despite not having a lot of either, we're almost there. However, with your help, not only will we be able to open the doors, we can also make something truly incredible right out of the gate.</p>
<p>And you'll be a part of it.</p>
<p>We already have had a lot of local interest before doing any marketing and we're confident that this venture is going to be successful. However, it still needs help. If you donate, you're instantly a part of the inner circle. One of the coolest nerds in Toledo's only nerdy bar!</p>
<p>The great folks that donate will be treated like royalty, get their name on a sign on the wall, and get to tell people that they're a major part of what makes The Basement so great.</p>
<p>Sure, there are a bunch of really awesome rewards, but everyone who donates anything will be helping to make a welcoming place for any nerd to call their home away from home (because it will look like the basement of their home) and we'll sing your praises forever. </p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>What we're shooting for is $10,000. That's it, just $10k. We'll take what we can get, which is why we're on Indiegogo, but to really get an awesome space done right, that's what will make it all happen. </p>
<p>The way the budget looks is this...</p>
<ul>
<li>Inventory - $4000</li>
<li>POS System - $1500</li>
<li>TVs, Entertainment, Arcade, and Retro Games - $1500</li>
<li>Decor and Furniture -$1000</li>
<li>Ice Maker - $500</li>
<li>Freezer - $200</li>
<li>Marketing, Opening Expenses, Rewards, Etc. - $1300</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>All of this is fine and dandy, but what are the goods, right? Well, check this out, all of the following are the first class of rewards and they all fold over, meaning that you get everything that is listed underneath what you spent with in the following...</p>
<p><u>$5 - Your Name on The Wall</u></p>
<p>Yup, you get to say how much more awesome you are than everyone else. Bragging rights guaranteed. You get what every nerd covets, the right to tell other nerds that you're more worthy. All we want in addition to that $5 is your photo if you're ok with it. We want to make something special.</p>
<p><u>$10 - Backer Sticker</u></p>
<p>Spend a little more and you get to brag a little more. You get your name on the wall, but also you get a spiffy sticker to tell tailgaters what's up! Cover up that stick figure family with something you can actually be proud of!</p>
<p><u>$15 - Pint Glass</u></p>
<p>Serious backers demand serious glassware. $15 gets you a backers glass, backers sticker, and, of course, the backers wall.</p>
<p><u>$25- Shirt</u></p>
<p>If you chip in a little more, you're gonna get everything above, plus a sweet backers shirt with the nifty logo on it. 'Nuff said, right?</p>
<p><u>$30 - Invitation to our private backers party</u></p>
<p>Ok, Shirt, Pint Glass, Sticker, Name on a thing, those things are standard, right? Well, check this out. Toss an extra $5 and you get all of that stuff, plus a special invitation to a super secret backers only Geekeasy party. Break in the place before the lessers and make friendly with the staff so that we all know you first hand and get an extra nod when you come back in.</p>
<p><u>$50 - Special Edition Backers Growler!!!</u></p>
<p>Ok, this may be one of the most awesome perks ever offered for a bar. You get all of the above, sure, but the growler is the best part. This is no ordinary growler. This little piece of awesome will get you the honor of having the privilege of getting it filled for the same price as our weekly discount day, FOR THE LIFE OF THE GROWLER!!! That's right! You heard me! This sucker gets you an extra deep discount so long as it lives. Never to be made or issued again!</p>
<h3>""Ok, Good for the Plebeians, but what about me?""</h3>
<p>Glad you asked.</p>
<p>Just for the extra hardcore and hard pressed geeks in the community, we cooked up a few really awesome rewards.

</div></div>","Short Summary
What ""The Basement"" will be is a safe haven for all things nerdy. This is the place to go knowing that there won't be any sports on TV or a loud band to interrupt, or worry about being made fun of for being openly a nerd. We hope to create a space that is officially and overtly intended to be everyone's nerdy basement away from home! Movie, Game and TV premieres, Comic Book events, Craft Beverages, Retro Arcade and Console games, Tabletop games, Esports Tournaments, like minded customers and staff to meet and make friends with, the list goes on and on about all of the things this bar is going to have, but the biggest, coolest thing we plan on having is you.
All of these things and events are cool but our focus is going to be dedicated on just having an atmosphere that is relaxed and open enough that any nerd can feel comfortable and enjoy themselves even during events about things they're not familiar with. TVs and Music will be kept at a good volume for conversation, we'll make every effort to make everything we do inclusive, and ensure the space is pleasant and comfortable for everyone there.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We don't need a whole lot in comparison to other starting bars. We're literally going into the basement of an established bar (The Distillery on Heatherdowns) in Toledo, but it's running independent of the bar above it, so we need to raise funds to set the place up and stock it. We're donating a lot of our own time and funds to make our Geekeasy a reality, and despite not having a lot of either, we're almost there. However, with your help, not only will we be able to open the doors, we can also make something truly incredible right out of the gate.
And you'll be a part of it.
We already have had a lot of local interest before doing any marketing and we're confident that this venture is going to be successful. However, it still needs help. If you donate, you're instantly a part of the inner circle. One of the coolest nerds in Toledo's only nerdy bar!
The great folks that donate will be treated like royalty, get their name on a sign on the wall, and get to tell people that they're a major part of what makes The Basement so great.
Sure, there are a bunch of really awesome rewards, but everyone who donates anything will be helping to make a welcoming place for any nerd to call their home away from home (because it will look like the basement of their home) and we'll sing your praises forever. 
The Goal
What we're shooting for is $10,000. That's it, just $10k. We'll take what we can get, which is why we're on Indiegogo, but to really get an awesome space done right, that's what will make it all happen. 
The way the budget looks is this...

Inventory - $4000
POS System - $1500
TVs, Entertainment, Arcade, and Retro Games - $1500
Decor and Furniture -$1000
Ice Maker - $500
Freezer - $200
Marketing, Opening Expenses, Rewards, Etc. - $1300

Rewards
All of this is fine and dandy, but what are the goods, right? Well, check this out, all of the following are the first class of rewards and they all fold over, meaning that you get everything that is listed underneath what you spent with in the following...
$5 - Your Name on The Wall
Yup, you get to say how much more awesome you are than everyone else. Bragging rights guaranteed. You get what every nerd covets, the right to tell other nerds that you're more worthy. All we want in addition to that $5 is your photo if you're ok with it. We want to make something special.
$10 - Backer Sticker
Spend a little more and you get to brag a little more. You get your name on the wall, but also you get a spiffy sticker to tell tailgaters what's up! Cover up that stick figure family with something you can actually be proud of!
$15 - Pint Glass
Serious backers demand serious glassware. $15 gets you a backers glass, backers sticker, and, of course, the backers wall.
$25- Shirt
If you chip in a little more, you're gonna get everything above, plus a sweet backers shirt with the nifty logo on it. 'Nuff said, right?
$30 - Invitation to our private backers party
Ok, Shirt, Pint Glass, Sticker, Name on a thing, those things are standard, right? Well, check this out. Toss an extra $5 and you get all of that stuff, plus a special invitation to a super secret backers only Geekeasy party. Break in the place before the lessers and make friendly with the staff so that we all know you first hand and get an extra nod when you come back in.
$50 - Special Edition Backers Growler!!!
Ok, this may be one of the most awesome perks ever offered for a bar. You get all of the above, sure, but the growler is the best part. This is no ordinary growler. This little piece of awesome will get you the honor of having the privilege of getting it filled for the same price as our weekly discount day, FOR THE LIFE OF THE GROWLER!!! That's right! You heard me! This sucker gets you an extra deep discount so long as it lives. Never to be made or issued again!
""Ok, Good for the Plebeians, but what about me?""
Glad you asked.
Just for the extra hardcore and hard pressed geeks in the community, we cooked up a few really awesome rewards. Needless to say, of course you get all of the rewards that the commoners above get, but if you throw down on one of these treats, you get the honor of knowing that you're one of the real serious players in our bar. These rewards go to a very limited number of people and if you're one of them, believe me, everyone is going to know.

<h3>Peter Newell: The NFB</h3>
<p>Newells’ as it is now opened in March, 2018 at The Historic Fort Bidwell Hotel in Fort Bidwell, California. The restaurant is owned by R.K. Newell and his wife, Laura Lee Newell. The location is ran onsite day to day by R.K.’s older brother, Peter Newell who lives on location at the hotel.</p>
<p>Peter has a history in the restaurant industry totaling over forty years in various positions, primarily as a line cook. He also has six years of experience in the banking industry, giving him a great number of skills needed to own and manage a restaurant. He also has a very loyal and helpful staff including a head waitress, baker, additional waitstaff and a busboy. </p>
<p>This campaign will help to keep a local restaurant in Fort Bidwell, a small rural town in Northeastern California open as it is now. This will also help to keep about five local jobs available and provide the local community with an excellent location for good food. We hope to establish this restaurant as a staple of the community in the future provide excellent foods and a great place for friends and family to spend a meal. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funding goal is $3,000 in order to ensure a smooth transition from RK and Lauralee to Peter and his team. This goal will allow Peter to purchase some equipment for the restaurant, specifically, computer and printing equipment as well as a Point of Sale system, operating software and office supplies. Peter has already taken action to purchase an LLC from which the business will be ran. In addition, some small kitchen tools and appliances will be replaced or updated and supplied and inventory will be taken care of. </p>
<p>We hope to be able to make this transition as smooth as possible, so the goal is to be able maintain a full stock of all of our inventory for the kitchen, so that we can offer all of our menu options everyday. We also want to be able to build a new, slightly smaller menu with a few more light options and winterize it all for the upcoming season. The laptop computer and the printer and office supplies will allow us to put together updated menus to reflect the changes to the restaurant, while keeping all the favorites. </p>
<p>Our restaurant is the only BBQ place in over 100 miles, and the only restaurant in 20 miles, making it uniquely located to serve the community. As we transition to update our menu, we hope to be able to offer excellent, simple food options including some BBQ and add in a few local special requests like the California club salad and some additional options for vegetables as well as making the place more walk-in friendly for our special treats like pretzels and donuts. We are hoping to make this restaurant a staple of the community by hosting game nights and making game boards available on all slow nights for guest to come in, grab a snack and have some fun with their friends. </p>
<p>Our goal is a bit ambitious for a small restaurant to be pursuing, but we believe that this goal is what it will take to really get this place switched over without any big hiccups along the way. </p>
<p>If we cannot reach our goal of $3,000 from this campaign, we will use whatever funds are earned to make some smaller purchases for the restaurant, depending on how much is earned from this fundraiser. Our other thoughts have included using any funds gained from this to purchase a computer and printer to work with for the restaurant itself, or maybe using our funds to pay for a fundraising dinner for the restaurant itself through Peter and his team. </p>
<p>We are also on the hunt for reasonable, reliable angel investors or shadow backers to help us fund our project with a loan at a reasonable interest rate. Business loans are not out of the question either, but we are hoping to avoid any loans if we can and keep our business local as much as possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fort Bidwell is a small town, and it is not flush with business here. The Historic Fort Bidwell Hotel, where Newells' is located and where we hope to relaunch The NFB is the only hotel in town, and has had a few restaurants try to make their way at this location. We hope to be one that remains, even as the owners change and we make some alterations. We want The NFB to remain a restaurant that people stop in on a trip or business from somewhere far away and they enjoy the food so much that they go home to Palm Springs, CA or Olympia, WA and tell their families. We want to be a place for the community and a draw for visitors beyond here. </p>
<p>This location has been running as a restaurant under the ownership of RK and Lauralee for the past six months or so with excellent success, drawing in a good number of people and we hope to maintain that momentum, even as we change over to Peter running more than just the kitchen. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Peter has plenty of restaurant experience, as we have mentioned, and he has some banking experience that will help him move out of just the kitchen and taken on full ownership of this location. Peter has also built and excellent team to help him along the way. He has been getting business help from Krystal Whittaker, a local seasonal worker who has agreed to stay the winter to help him. She will be utilizing her degree in business management and entrepreneurship to help him put together proper business plans and maintain his bookkeeping. She will also be working in the kitchen as baker, utilizing her experience as a local cottage foods baker and learning about line cooking along the way.</p>
<p>Our team also has Roxanne Klugherz as the head waitress and operations manager for our restaurant as well, utilizing her years of waitressing and managing experience in order to ensure that our service runs smooth and excellent. We also have a waitress lined up to take a spot when we relaunch and a busboy, both of whom are experienced and well trained for our restaurant. </p>
<p>One of our largest hurdles will be reaching our funding goals to get this project into place and relaunch the restaurant under it's new name with it's new owner. The fundraising is just one of our many projects to help fund our restaurant, and we are very ambitious about reaching this goal before the year is through. Our other hurdle will be to take this business and survive through the winter, when our customer turn over may slow significantly and make sales a bit more difficult. </p>
<p>We have a few plans in place to work through our funding issues right now, including this fundraiser, and a few more that might develop in the future. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sharing our story with others is an excellent way to help, please give us a hand in promoting our story across the web! We are also on the hunt for board games and decorative items that match the antique style of the hotel. Even if you can't contribute financially, we would love to have your support through networking. Locals can keep in touch with us as well, and keep an eye out for future fundraising events. </p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your interest and support in developing The NFB as a local restaurant and hangout spot~!</p>

<p><strong><i>We have heard some rumors that the Santa Fe Greenhouse property might be sold.</i></strong> We are open to all options - be it this property or a comparable property in Santa Fe for the Project Urban Greenhouse Farm. Please <a href=""mailto:info@projecturbangreenhouse.org?subject=Property"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact us</a> asap if you know of something.</p>
<h3>Local Healthy Food!</h3>
<p>Did you know that 27% of NM children go hungry? It's the highest in the nation, but nothing to boast about.</p>
<p>This fact has haunted me for as long as I have known about it, Project Urban Greenhouse was born of it. I thought that if only we could teach children, families and community how to grow food all year round, we could put a huge dent into this problem.</p>
<p>And so it began.</p>
<p>My passions are business, making a change in the world, and the long term sustainability of farming in our arid southwest climate. While the farm will be providing healthy, organic, local food, it will also give us the funding for the work of making sure our kids get enough to eat.</p>
<p>There are no commercial farms in Santa Fe. My name is Darshan and I am starting Project Urban Greenhouse Farm on the former Santa Fe Greenhouses property with a team of experts in Aquaponic farming. I have certification in Controlled Environment Agriculture and I am really excited to bring you healthy food: no preservatives, no pesticides - just fresh, yummy food, all year round.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help us build out the 21,000 square foot facility, with a complete aquaponic system - deep water troughs, vertical towers, fish tanks, plumbing, electricity, backup systems, processing space. It will also help us get us started with the tools and materials we need to grow over 25,000 plants a month - that's a lot of seeds. We'll be growing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of lettuce, types like bibb, dragoon, butter, and romaine</li>
<li>Greens like chard, watercress, and kale</li>
<li>Herbs like basil, rosemary, thyme, mint, parsley and dill</li>
<li>Cucumbers, those cute Persian style ones that are crunchy and delicious</li>
<li>Tomatoes</li>
<li>Gourmet mushrooms<ul><li>and more...</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We estimate it will take 4-6 weeks to get everything set up and running and then it's 4-6 weeks until we are harvesting our first crops.</p>
<p>Once the farm is up and running successfully, we will start putting funding into our 501(c)(3) organization and this is where the work will begin, going out into the community to teach children and families how to grow food all year round. Our idea was to create a consistent resource for our funding, rather than seeking short term grants.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495329449/qzveoo5g38wj4d1jj4sw.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $250,000 to set up the farm. Even though we're doing a lot of work ourselves and being very conservative with fixed assets here's an overview of what we think we need to get going efficiently:</p>
<ul>
<li>a cooled walk-in storage space,</li>
<li>a delivery truck (cooled),</li>
<li>a small pick-up,</li>
<li>wood, screws, corner braces, food grade lining and other materials to build the troughs,</li>
<li>some hired help to build them (approx 38 troughs, 4'x60')</li>
<li>oxygen concentrators, airstones and aeration tubing throughout</li>
<li>fish tanks, clarifiers, mineralization tank(s)</li>
<li>electrical and plumbing contractors</li>
<li>backup generators so nothing dies if there's a brown-out or a black-out</li>
<li>a bato bucket system (buckets, lids, plumbing, reservoirs, media)</li>
<li>simple monitoring systems</li>
<li>and a lot of start up materials - everything from seeds, to gloves, to boxes, grow plugs, office supplies, cleaning supplies, hoses, and so many little things</li>
<li>utilities</li>
<li>we will hire two people full time once the farm is up and running - it's a lot of space, it takes time and energy to manage 21,000 square feet. This is the minimum amount of help we can get by on and we will hire more people as it moves forward.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495330125/db310hl4h8tucnwxwydt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>We've thought long and hard about how we can share with you. What gifts could be better than our own produce? And being very practical, we came up with different levels of giving and packages all including our produce - you get fresh greens and herbs for three months to a year; AND we got creative so that people who are not in Santa Fe can also participate.</p>
<p>For Santa Feans the produce packages will be available for weekly pick up on site (Rufina St, Santa Fe).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495757239/beqosqfxbtnj6asaq3w3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For our out-of-state friends or those who prefer to donate the food, we are working with three local nonprofits and you can choose who we will deliver food to each week: The Food Depot, Esperanza Shelter for Battered Families, or the Espanola Ashram Langar program.  Each of these nonprofits has agreed to issue a donation letter which you will receive from them at the end of your donated food cycle.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Project Urban Greenhouse Farm will produce amazing, local, healthy food for you AND, once it's established, it will contribute to our 501 C3 non profit, Project Urban Greenhouse Impact. Project Urban Greenhouse Impact will teach people, especially those struggling financially, how to grow healthy food all year round.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always inherent risks in a start up - the electricity could go out and the fish could die, pests could overtake a crop and require that we pull everything out and start over. To mitigate this risk, all those experts I mentioned earlier, have helped set up systems for proactive Integrated Pest Management (no pesticides! only organic pest control practices!), back up systems that don't fail, and systems and controls to keep on top of things.</p>
<p>Further, the budget has been built in such a way that there is room for some mishaps without the business being put into jeopardy. We think that a great deal of care and attention has been given to Project Urban Greenhouse Farm planning, so that we can be on our toes and proactive in any situation we could imagine.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we have one of the most world-renown aquaponics experts on our advisory team who is very actively helping with design and set up. We feel very equipped to look at any situation and work together to find immediate, viable solutions.</p>

</div></div>","We have heard some rumors that the Santa Fe Greenhouse property might be sold. We are open to all options - be it this property or a comparable property in Santa Fe for the Project Urban Greenhouse Farm. Please contact us asap if you know of something.
Local Healthy Food!
Did you know that 27% of NM children go hungry? It's the highest in the nation, but nothing to boast about.
This fact has haunted me for as long as I have known about it, Project Urban Greenhouse was born of it. I thought that if only we could teach children, families and community how to grow food all year round, we could put a huge dent into this problem.
And so it began.
My passions are business, making a change in the world, and the long term sustainability of farming in our arid southwest climate. While the farm will be providing healthy, organic, local food, it will also give us the funding for the work of making sure our kids get enough to eat.
There are no commercial farms in Santa Fe. My name is Darshan and I am starting Project Urban Greenhouse Farm on the former Santa Fe Greenhouses property with a team of experts in Aquaponic farming. I have certification in Controlled Environment Agriculture and I am really excited to bring you healthy food: no preservatives, no pesticides - just fresh, yummy food, all year round.
Your contributions will help us build out the 21,000 square foot facility, with a complete aquaponic system - deep water troughs, vertical towers, fish tanks, plumbing, electricity, backup systems, processing space. It will also help us get us started with the tools and materials we need to grow over 25,000 plants a month - that's a lot of seeds. We'll be growing:

Lots of lettuce, types like bibb, dragoon, butter, and romaine
Greens like chard, watercress, and kale
Herbs like basil, rosemary, thyme, mint, parsley and dill
Cucumbers, those cute Persian style ones that are crunchy and delicious
Tomatoes
Gourmet mushroomsand more...


We estimate it will take 4-6 weeks to get everything set up and running and then it's 4-6 weeks until we are harvesting our first crops.
Once the farm is up and running successfully, we will start putting funding into our 501(c)(3) organization and this is where the work will begin, going out into the community to teach children and families how to grow food all year round. Our idea was to create a consistent resource for our funding, rather than seeking short term grants.


What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $250,000 to set up the farm. Even though we're doing a lot of work ourselves and being very conservative with fixed assets here's an overview of what we think we need to get going efficiently:

a cooled walk-in storage space,
a delivery truck (cooled),
a small pick-up,
wood, screws, corner braces, food grade lining and other materials to build the troughs,
some hired help to build them (approx 38 troughs, 4'x60')
oxygen concentrators, airstones and aeration tubing throughout
fish tanks, clarifiers, mineralization tank(s)
electrical and plumbing contractors
backup generators so nothing dies if there's a brown-out or a black-out
a bato bucket system (buckets, lids, plumbing, reservoirs, media)
simple monitoring systems
and a lot of start up materials - everything from seeds, to gloves, to boxes, grow plugs, office supplies, cleaning supplies, hoses, and so many little things
utilities
we will hire two people full time once the farm is up and running - it's a lot of space, it takes time and energy to manage 21,000 square feet. This is the minimum amount of help we can get by on and we will hire more people as it moves forward.


What's in it for you?
We've thought long and hard about how we can share with you. What gifts could be better than our own produce? And being very practical, we came up with different levels of giving and packages all including our produce - you get fresh greens and herbs for three months to a year; AND we got creative so that people who are not in Santa Fe can also participate.
For Santa Feans the produce packages will be available for weekly pick up on site (Rufina St, Santa Fe).

For our out-of-state friends or those who prefer to donate the food, we are working with three local nonprofits and you can choose who we will deliver food to each week: The Food Depot, Esperanza Shelter for Battered Families, or the Espanola Ashram Langar program.  Each of these nonprofits has agreed to issue a donation letter which you will receive from them at the end of your donated food cycle.
          

The Impact
Project Urban Greenhouse Farm will produce amazing, local, healthy food for you AND, once it's established, it will contribute to our 501 C3 non profit, Project Urban Greenhouse Impact. Project Urban Greenhouse Impact will teach people, especially those struggling financially, how to grow healthy food all year round.

Risks & Challenges
There are always inherent risks in a start up - the electricity could go out and the fish could die, pests could overtake a crop and require that we pull everything out and start over. To mitigate this risk, all those experts I mentioned earlier, have helped set up systems for proactive Integrated Pest Management (no pesticides! only organic pest control practices!), back up systems that don't fail, and systems and controls to keep on top of things.
Further, the budget has been built in such a way that there is room for some mishaps without the business being put into jeopardy. We think that a great deal of care and attention has been given to Project Urban Greenhouse Farm planning, so that we can be on our toes and proactive in any situation we could imagine.
Last but not least, we have one of the most world-renown aquaponics experts on our advisory team who is very actively helping with design and set up. We feel very equipped to look at any situation and work together to find immediate, viable solutions.

<p>The Franklin Hotel Bar is pleased to introduce it's inaugural offering in the Barrel Buyers Club.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A limited number of 60 guests will have the opportunity to pre-purchase a voucher for a bottle of  Knob Creek 9 Year Old, 120-Proof Single Barrel Bourbon to be stored at the Franklin Hotel Bar and consumed neat, on ice, as an Old Fashioned or as a Manhattan at no additional charge whenever they stop in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How the program works:</p>
<p>•Purchase your membership to the Franklin Hotel Bar Barrel Buyers Club:  Knob Creek 9 Year Old, 120-Proof Single Barrel Bourbon for $149.</p>
<p>•For every bottle purchased, you will be granted one admission to the Private Barrel Selection Event, to be held on a Monday evening at a date to be determined. Members will sample three (3) Knob Creek 9 Year Old, 120-Proof Single Barrel Bourbons from three (3) different barrels. Complimentary small plates to enjoy with your samples will be provided as well.</p>
<p>•Each member will be able to cast one vote for every bottle they have pre-purchased. The barrel that receives the most votes will be the one that is bottled especially for us.</p>
<p>•Once the bottles arrive from the distillery, each buyer may redeem their voucher for a hand-numbered bottle with the Franklin Hotel Bar logo printed on it that they can request whenever they patronize the Franklin Hotel Bar. Their Knob Creek may be requested neat, on ice, as an Old Fashioned or as a Manhattan at no charge  for themselves or their guests whenever they stop in, for the duration of their bottle.</p>
<p>•Once the bottle has been finished, the empty limited-edition custom bottle will be presented to the Barrel Club Buyer as a keepsake from the experience.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges and Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>We believe that food and farming have an incredible capacity to transform and heal. We have seen the effect that working in the soil has had on people who’ve been disconnected from it. We have experienced the joy and transformation that come when people eat lovingly grown food prepared with great care. We have worked to build stronger, more engaged communities through food and farming. We know the improved health benefits that come with a more natural, less processed, and nutritionally balanced diet.</p>
<p>We have the opportunity to create a more just and representational food system. As a farm with women, intergenerational, interracial, and queer and straight owners, focused on building an equitable business, we hope to model a new possibility in the world of farming. A justice based farm that is financially sustainable, and shares what we learn and do to continue to build a more representational food movement.</p>
<p>We are ready to take the next step in building this model - a community kitchen, just down the road from our farm. The kitchen will allow us to host more classes near the farm, both during the growing season, and beyond. It will enable us to grow the diversity of products we create, including drying herbs for teas and herb salts, a greater range of fermented food products, and traditionally canned items. It will be a resource for other local farmers and local food based businesses to use to create value added products. And we will partner with our neighboring business, The Green Onion, to host events, dances, retreats and more for all the communities we serve.</p>

<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>We are Rise &amp; Root Farm, a 3 acre collectively run farm located in the famous and fertile black dirt of Chester, NY. We grow vegetables, flowers, and herbs using sustainable growing methods. In addition to being farmers, we are educators, community organizers and food entrepreneurs with deep roots in New York City and an unwavering commitment to engaging rural and urban communities through food and farming.

<p><strong>How We’ll Make This Happen Together (What We Need &amp; What You Get)</strong></p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is $10,000, with a stretch goal of $20,000. Our budget to build out and equip the kitchen space is $45,000. We have already secured a low interest loan of $25,000, so the funds we raise through this campaign will help us close the gap.</p>
<p>The money will help us pay for reconstruction of an existing barn into a commercially certified kitchen. The barn hasn’t been used since 1999 and previously held a farm market. The infrastructure is sound, and it has power and town water. We will build out the interior of the space, putting in functioning bathrooms, walls, plumbing and gas lines. We will add in windows for lighting and finish the second floor as a drying area with a fan. We will equip the space with sinks, stoves, a fermentation walk-in cooler and standard walk-in coolers, preservation equipment such as dehydrators and canning equipment, tables and chairs for classes, and storage shelves for neighbors who rent the kitchen. The costs for the buildout are estimated at $20,000 with the equipment estimated at an additional $25,000.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473286256/sgpargbakzpr2ws1qjk0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When you help us plant the seeds to grow the kitchen space, your harvest will be bountiful. Everyone who donates $25 or more will receive a kitchen magnet and have their name added to a donor sign in the kitchen. For higher donations, additional perks include an invitation to a grand opening party, free classes, the opportunity to have one of our products named after you or someone you love, a private label product for your event, host your event at the kitchen space, and more. And most importantly, your contribution is a chance to feel great about the fact that you are making a real difference in strengthening the roots of our farm and helping us continue the work that we are doing.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>In the first season and a half of our farm, we have done a lot to build a better food landscape. With the kitchen space, we will build on this existing work: creating healthy food products; hosting more classes and events in our local community; creating new partnerships around education and employment opportunities; reinvigorating the downtown of our new home in the Village of Chester; and building a welcoming, safe space to experience, learn, grow, and heal around farming and cooking.</p>
<p>Here's some of what we've done so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Growing organically with an eye to our ecosystem</strong> - We are transitioning the land from conventional agriculture to organic. We choose varieties of plants that will encourage beneficial insects, and we discourage pests through crop rotation, flower plantings, and row covers.  We are pleased to see that in our second season there are far more pollinators and other insects present.</li>
<li>
<strong>Providing fresh produce to a variety of communities </strong>- We sell our food and flowers at two markets in New York City - La Familia Verde, a community market in the Bronx, and Union Square, in the heart of Manhattan. We also sell closer to the farm in Goshen, NY. We strive to create a balance of markets so we can provide fresh food for all communities.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hosting healing work days</strong> - individuals come to the farm and work beside us in the soil. We talk, listen to the birds and frogs, taste plants, and enjoy a lunch together where we talk about the work we are doing and why.</li>
<li>
<strong>Partnering with the local food pantry</strong> - located in the kitchen of the Chester Presbyterian Church, we create nutritious dishes that highlight the fresh produce available at the monthly pantry. We encourage people to taste how the fresh produce can be used and take it home to try it themselves.</li>
<li>
<strong>Collaborating with food justice and educational organizations</strong> - Through classes, workshops, tours, and pop-up events in NYC or on the farm, we continue to build connections within the farming and food justice community and the broader communities we serve. Some of these organizations include: such as Farm School NYC, Just Food, Northeast Atlantic Marine Alliance, The Youth Farm, International Rescue Committee, Mary Mitchell Center, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473286303/lwzqcadmrzanbcupuevx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>One of the major risks involved in farming is weather. The kitchen space will allow us to mitigate some of this risk by creating diversified revenue that is less weather dependent.</p>
<p>The major risk for the kitchen is taking on additional fixed monthly expenses including rent and utilities. We will manage risk through diverse streams of revenue. In addition to making value-added products (products that add value to crops grown in the field) ourselves, we will rent the kitchen space to other farmers and local food producers. We will create a shared kitchen that specializes in fermented food products - something that does not exist in New York state. We will also host classes - both agricultural, culinary, and justice based - and events, both food and cultural.</p>
<p>All four owners of the farm are teachers. Collectively we’ve taught for Farm School NYC, the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems at UCSC, the Natural Gourmet Institute, Just Food, and for a myriad of local, regional and national food and farming organizations. Our connections to each other and our communities are what make us strong. We will draw on those connections as much as we work to build them - to ensure that this next step of our farm dream is successful.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We understand that not everyone is in a position to contribute to our campaign with money. Even if you don’t donate, there are still great ways that we can build this thing together:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Spread the word!</strong> Share this campaign to your friends and followers on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. Share with your loved ones and help us grow this network.</li>
<li>
<strong>Donate your services:</strong> if you have construction, plumbing, electrical, painting or other building skills, let us know if you’d like to raise this kitchen in a physical way.</li>
<li>
<strong>Donate stuff:</strong> we need a lot of equipment and supplies to make this kitchen happen. If you have prep tables, metro shelving, plywood, sheetrock, tools, paint, nails, stoves, etc. we can probably use it. See our website for a longer list of things we can use at the farm.</li>
<li>
<strong>Spread the word!</strong> We can’t emphasize this one enough. If you tell your friends and they tell their friends, and so on, we really start to build something super cool.</li>

</div></div>","Challenges and Opportunity
We believe that food and farming have an incredible capacity to transform and heal. We have seen the effect that working in the soil has had on people who’ve been disconnected from it. We have experienced the joy and transformation that come when people eat lovingly grown food prepared with great care. We have worked to build stronger, more engaged communities through food and farming. We know the improved health benefits that come with a more natural, less processed, and nutritionally balanced diet.
We have the opportunity to create a more just and representational food system. As a farm with women, intergenerational, interracial, and queer and straight owners, focused on building an equitable business, we hope to model a new possibility in the world of farming. A justice based farm that is financially sustainable, and shares what we learn and do to continue to build a more representational food movement.
We are ready to take the next step in building this model - a community kitchen, just down the road from our farm. The kitchen will allow us to host more classes near the farm, both during the growing season, and beyond. It will enable us to grow the diversity of products we create, including drying herbs for teas and herb salts, a greater range of fermented food products, and traditionally canned items. It will be a resource for other local farmers and local food based businesses to use to create value added products. And we will partner with our neighboring business, The Green Onion, to host events, dances, retreats and more for all the communities we serve.

Who we are
We are Rise & Root Farm, a 3 acre collectively run farm located in the famous and fertile black dirt of Chester, NY. We grow vegetables, flowers, and herbs using sustainable growing methods. In addition to being farmers, we are educators, community organizers and food entrepreneurs with deep roots in New York City and an unwavering commitment to engaging rural and urban communities through food and farming. Collectively we have decades of farming and gardening experience, both rural and in the city. We are committed to increasing opportunities for all people to grow and eat good food.

Among us are founders, teachers, and the former Director of New York City’s Farm School NYC, three graduates of the internationally acclaimed Ecological Horticulture Apprenticeship program at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), a 2014 James Beard Leadership Award recipient, founders of Black Urban Growers, a Gramercy Tavern chef alum, and the Founder and Chef of Crock & Jar. In 2012, our farm team participated in Grow NYC's Farm Beginnings program, developing our farm vision and business plan, which includes a commercial kitchen space. In 2015, we launched our first Indiegogo fundraiser, reached our funding goal, and have been running our farm successfully for a year and a half. Now it's time to grow.
With our collective knowledge, skills and experience working with food from seed to table, we are creating a farm that reflects our values for growing ethically and sustainably on the land while providing healthy food and healing experiences to our communities and growing a strong local food economy.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After a successful first year at lauded soba restaurant Kamonegi, Chef Mutsuko Soma and fellow sake sommelier Russell King will open Hannyatou, a sake bar and retail shop to highlight unique, specialized sake along with promoting sake education and enjoyment in Seattle. Hannyatou will also boast a bar menu highlighting traditional fermentation techniques that have been practiced for generations, creating seasonal small dishes meant to enhance the sake experience. Hannyatou will open in the former Lama G Cafe space, two doors down from Kamonegi, and will seat about 20 people along with additional patio seating in the Spring and Summer months.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.seattlemet.com/articles/2019/1/2/kamonegi-chef-mutsuko-soma-is-opening-a-sake-bar"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We’re happy to announce that we have secured the Hannyatou space</a>, one close enough to Kamonegi with hopes of providing a different experience and perhaps a waiting spot to enjoy small bites and sake before securing your table at Kamonegi. Your support will help provide funds to fix up the intimate patio space for the Spring and Summer months and renovate the space. Hannyatou is a small space, and we hope to install an awning or shade over the patio and purchase heat lamps so we can continue to utilize the space on fair weather days; sounds crazy, but there’s nothing quite like sake on a grey drizzly day.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the last few years, the enjoyment and production of sake in western markets have grown exponentially making sake a top contender with other spirits and even wine in restaurants. Such growth has led to more local sake brewers and a diverse array of sake being introduced to western markets. Despite its growing popularity, we are still limited in places and retail options where one can obtain and experience a wide range of sakes from the classic, clean Junmai Daigingo to more eccentric varieties utilizing new rice strains or varietal flower yeasts. We aim to provide a space through Hannyatou for producers and brewers to showcase new products and for guests grow from casual sake drinkers to true enthusiasts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While restaurant and bar openings are always a challenging endeavor, we ask for your support to minimize our risk. Your support will be an added safeguard that will allow us to address all necessary changes to the space, which may otherwise have to address gradually as we acquire the funds. What this means is that we will be able to start work on the most challenging aspects of the space which includes clean up, renovation, and weather proofing of our space and patio. This head start, particularly in our first year of opening, will lend to our success, longevity, and greater ability to service the local community.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>For some time now Jerrel Goins and I (Chris Ehorn) have wanted to open our own Ice Cream shop. Not just any Ice Cream shop though. One that combines ORGANIC cream with LIQUID NITROGEN to create a FRESH ice cream right before your eyes! I bet you didn’t even know ice cream could be fresh. We want to open it in beautiful down town San Diego where I live. We want to stand out even more by having nothing but the best flavors by using fresh fruit, homemade cookie dough, etc. We want to support local business also by buying our fruits from local markets, getting our chocolate and caramels from family owned businesses and so forth. We want everyone to benefit. We thought about going with investors on this, but ones we have spoken with want to do things their way, and the cheap quick way. We want it to be not just a great show by seeing the ice cream made right in front of you, but we want you to love the taste so it keeps you wanting more. We want our providers to want and enjoy doing business with us. We want people to make it an event coming to Sempre Dolce so they can experience this liquid nitrogen organic ice cream. Having lived in Italy for two years, I've eaten my fair share of gelato, the best ice cream you can get, and I know what makes people happy. We want to have those unique flavors that are loved so much, that separate us from every other ice cream parlor.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have our business plan and know that we need to raise $60,000 to get things up and running so we can open up right away. We already have a location right accross the street from Petco Park were the Padres play! Its in a prime location, but we need your help to secure it. Also your contributions will go to us getting the equipment that is needed to make gallons upon gallons of liquid nitrogen ice cream everyday.  We need your support to get this done. We are going to give back in more ways than one. not just directly back to you as you will see in our perks section, but also to those that need it most.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We saw this not just as a great business opportunity, or a way to make the most exciting organic ice cream, but a way we can give back to those that need it most. For example, during national breast cancer awareness month, we will donate 5% to the American Cancer Society, as well as have pink ice cream cups, spoons, and napkins to raise awareness. It is something that has touched us and our families personally and we want to help. Also having a wife that works as a radiation therapist and works with cancer patients daily, it is something we feel strongly about. We have many more ideas when it comes to ways to help, whether it’s to help those less fortunate, sick, or struggling, we will find ways to help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Anything you can contribute helps. Even if its word of mouth. You can direct people to our page by posting our url on your Facebook, twitter, or even myspace (we wont judge you for that). Share our video and page with the world.</p>

<br/>Why did we build it?</h3><p>We want you to be able to not only <strong>cook perfectly</strong>, but <strong>cook safely</strong>. <br/><br/>Food borne illness is still a very big public health challenge in the United States alone. The CDC estimates that EVERY year there are 48 million cases resulting in 128,000 hospitalizations, and out of that unfortunately 3000 fatalities. This is really too much of a social problem to ignore and we can reduce these numbers dramatically and save lives if more households in America had the K-Mometer. </p><p>The only way to TRULY know if your food is safe to eat is if you cook it to the exact internal temperature recommended by the USDA. For example, that’s 165 degrees Fahrenheit for turkey. Recent research has also shown that color and texture are not RELIABLE indicators of whether the food is truly done. If you don’t have this information, chances are you can get very sick, and of course that’s not a very good thing, especially if you have young children and/or seniors you’re taking care of.</p><h3>
<br/>It has to be fun and affordable too!</h3><p>We want to help solve real world challenges with our connected devices, like the K-Mometer. The devices shouldn’t just be about the coolness factor. They should also address a real need. But how many times have you walked into Best Buy or Target or Walmart and said, ""That looks like a cool gizmo but it’s way too pricey for me"" … you get that sticker shock right? Our goal is to make these devices affordable so that everyone can have access to them, not just if you’re in the middle or upper class income range. The K-Mometer is only the first device in what we hope to be a pipeline of devices that will each help solve different challenges. <br/><br/>Also, it should be fun to use. How many times have you used a gizmo for a few weeks and then it sits on the shelf? That’s why we’re also building a true rewards system into the mobile app. Collect points for using the K-Mometer on a regular basis and then redeem them for rewards later. </p><p>So not only are you going to be ensuring that the food you cook tastes great, is safe, but you’ll have fun doing it.  </p><h3>
<br/>When are we delivering it?</h3><p>The K-Mometer will be ready to ship in the Fall of 2017. The first 250 units will be ready to ship in November, followed by product delivery to our next 1000 backers in December. It will make a great Thanksgiving and Christmas gift this holiday season.

<h2>About The Sauce &amp; Me</h2>
<p>As a home cook who has always loved hot sauce, I was starting to get annoyed with the constant bombarding of gross-tasting heat in all these gimmicky sauces! All heat, no flavor and NEVER would you consider putting them on food.</p>
<p>I wanted something with flavor, depth, controlled and natural heat and a combination of flavors that hit different spots on the tongue. SO, my hot sauce was born!! </p>
<p>Tropical Coffee Habanero is a blend of Mango, Espresso grounds and Habanero peppers! With all-natural ingredients, the sauce is 100% vegan and gluten-free.  </p>
<p>The sauce has been APPROVED by the Cornell Food Lab as shelf-stable and safe!</p>
<p>My goal is to make food that has ingredients you can pronounce, flavors you recognize and love, and no hesitancy due to lack of knowledge of these crazy ingredients other sauces use. </p>
<h2>Funding &amp; Rewards</h2>
<p>The funding that I am seeking is ONLY for the cost of health department inspections, courses, certifications, and licenses. ALL the things that NY makes you go through when you make a hot sauce. This money would allow me to be able to start selling online, at farmer's markets and to stores &amp; restaurants. </p>
<h3>ANY DONATION AMOUNT IS WELCOME!</h3>
<p>What you will get: </p>
<p>$10+ higher pledge - 5 oz bottle of Tropical Coffee Habanero</p>
<p>$25+ pledge - 3 of the 5 oz bottles of Tropical Coffee Habanero</p>
<p>$50+ pledge - 6 of the 5 oz bottles of Tropical Coffee Habanero</p>
<p>I am only asking for the funds for licenses. I am not looking for everyone to fund this company, I want people to be able to still get my sauce in some way while I go through the rigorous and extensive process that NY state requires when you make something this acidic! </p>
<p>This is a chance for you to support an independent business that could grow exponentially, and a chance for me to continue sharing my passion for good, clean and natural foods with the world!</p>

<h3>Who is Good Boy?</h3>
<p>Good Boy is not a single person or well-behaved animal. It is everyone that enjoys drinking quality wine ... accessible, authentic and appropriately imperfect. A wine to bring a friend's housewarming, pair with your partner's famous Khao Soi, or toss in a cooler and imbibe outside whilst watching the sun sink slowly into the mighty Pacific. </p>
<p>In 2017 — and admittedly over a couple of hazy pints and fried chicken in an Echo Park dive — the thought hit us. Why is it that in most of western Europe you can't go two blocks without finding a wine that is reasonably priced, vibrant, balanced and shows an expression of place? While here in Los Angeles it is rare to find a locally made, fun and easy drinking wine.</p>
<p>After our second-ish beer, we decided it was time to look behind the smoke and mirrors of the industrialized winemaking industry and get back to basics in our home cellar. We set out to create a wine with little intervention and little knowledge, but heaps of passion.</p>
<p>And after a year of meeting with organic farmers in southern California, learning as much as possible from skilled natural winemakers, and reading more scientific texts with terms such as ""anaerobic"", ""malolactic"", ""VvADH activity"", we finally harvested and foot stomped our first vintage of Good Boy Wine in 2018.</p>

<p>To make wine it takes a few things - Knowledge, Time &amp; Grapes. Grapes definitely help. </p>
<p>Now, we've got the knowledge on lock. And we have the time, but we need the grapes for our new vintage. For that, we need you. </p>
<p>We've sourced 2 types of grapes from organic farmers in the Santa Ynez Valley. Although, as we have learned, organic farming is not easy work. We're committed to only sourcing unsprayed and unmodified grapes to make our wine. And it doesn't come cheap.</p>
<p><strong>This is where you come in</strong>. We are not looking for donations, <u>we are looking for partnerships.</u> With every contribution, you will be receiving some wine in which without you, it wouldn't be possible to create. With your contribution, you become a Good Boy (or Girl of course), because honestly, at the start with any contribution, you become part of the family.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $7,500. With your support, we will be able to acquire the grapes, a couple of barrels, bottling equipment, and all the other necessities (bottles, corks, labels, etc) to grow our production.</p>
<p>As a big ol' thank you for your partners, we have some pretty nice perks, including an all you can eat, all you can drink backyard Bacchanalia!  After all, our goal is to not only make wine in Los Angeles but to build a supportive community of Good Boys and Girls that appreciate the finer, funkier, (and more sustainable) things in life.</p>

Our goal is to raise $7,500. With your support, we will be able to acquire the grapes, a couple of barrels, bottling equipment, and all the other necessities (bottles, corks, labels, etc) to grow our production.
As a big ol' thank you for your partners, we have some pretty nice perks, including an all you can eat, all you can drink backyard Bacchanalia!  After all, our goal is to not only make wine in Los Angeles but to build a supportive community of Good Boys and Girls that appreciate the finer, funkier, (and more sustainable) things in life.
Join us and together let's bring great natural wine to Los Angeles!

<h3>Why Deep Steeps</h3>
<p>Matt Bius had tea with an Austin tea master one day and it changed how he would look at tea forever. He discovered the style of Gongfu Cha, the art of cultivating the experience of tea and it was wonderful. He knew that he wanted to share this amazing experience with as many people as he could, so with his friend Justin Phillips, LAc. in tow he set out to create Deep Steeps; not just another tea crate, but a tea adventure! Bringing together the practice of Gongfu Cha, with incredible teas sourced from top tea importers, teaware, and education Deep Steeps helps every subscriber get the best out of their tea.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To reach a broader audience Deep Steeps needs to get their hands on enough great tea, teaware, and shipping materials to get the Gongfu Cha experience out to the world. That means start up. Our goal of $2500 will give us the ability to get enough of those things to get a first month up and running, which will then give us the ability to create a second month, and then a third, and so on. </p>
<p>For helping us get started you get some great stuff. First off, you get a subscription to Deep Steeps which will include your first month (with later months auto-billed month to month if you like the service). This can be at our one tea per month, or our two teas per month level. For being one of our founding members you get a few extra things. We'll be running some behind the scenes fun like a Snapchat so you can watch the program you helped build grow, as well as keep up with all our fun tea-fueled shenanigans. You'll also be enrolled in our Founders Club which will entitle you to bonus teas and items periodically throughout the year, stuff no one else will ever be able to get!</p>
<p>More than anything what we want to do is help you feel like you're a part of this process. There is a real sense of community around Gongfu Cha, and for everyone that helps us make this dream real we want you to know that you will always be a part of our community!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our greatest challenge is just getting off the ground, but we can all overcome that together! One of the great things about a service like this is that even if we don't hit our full funding goal, we can still launch for the backers that supported us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate all our friends and tea lovers and recognize that not everyone can get involved with a monthly subscription. That's ok, please share this campaign, talk about it, hash tag us, and more! We would love to hear from you!</p>

<h3>The Handover Gin Story</h3>
<p>Handover Gin has been in progress since 2014, when I took delivery of our first custom test equipment and built a small test lab in an unused unit upstairs from my apartment to work on the recipe for Handover Gin, including researching licensing, meeting with various government departments, and working closely with a consultant to confirm the requirements for setting up Hong Kong’s first craft distillery.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542741297/el1qwjtyhxt53py8oyoo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since I’m originally from New Zealand, where it’s legal to make spirits for personal consumption, I’ve been producing spirits on a small scale for friends and family since I was eighteen, the past 4 years I have been traveling to the States to train as a Artisan Distiller </p>

<p><strong>The Gin</strong></p>
<p>What once was British turns eastward and undergoes a reinvention.</p>
<p>Such is the story of Handover Gin, the first Hong Kong gin. We earned that distinction by building the first distillery in the Pearl of the Orient and then infusing the complexity of Hong Kong into every hand-crafted batch. Classic ginseng (人參) lends a luscious earthiness, balanced by the delicate citrus notes of bitter orange (酸橙). Chinese cinnamon (肉桂) has a warming effect, while the effects of horny goat weed (淫羊藿) are legendary. In all, eleven organic botanicals complement the fundamental essence of fresh juniper, resulting in a gin that honours a past tradition while establishing a new one.</p>
<p>This is gin by our rules. As rich and vibrant as the culture that inspired it, Handover Gin is the spirit of Hong Kong.</p>

<h3><strong>Where, Exactly, Is the Money Going?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Funding Goal</strong></p>
<p>Starting Hong Kong first distillery and producing award winning Gin isn't easy.  It requires top shelf distilling equipment, as well as extensive experience and professional knowledge. Fortunately, we’ve already accomplished most of this. We already have our custom made 100 litre Artisan Still and the facilities to produce. Now we need to start purchasing more botanicals and bottles, mixing tanks for our first production run  of our award winning Handover Gin</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goal #1</strong></p>
<p>We've set a  stretch goal at $63,000, which will allow for the purchase of additional equipment enabling us to finalize R&amp;D and begin production of our other spirits like Vodka, Rum and every Hongkongers favourite....Whisky, we can all drink to that, yes?</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div><div>
<p>In order to manufacture spirits, we have obtained various permits and licenses from the Hong Kong government. Each of these has had its own challenges. There is much red tape surrounding the production of alcohol in this region and we have worked with various parts of the Hong Kong government for four years to get this far in the process; our primary risk is delays on equipment manufacturing as most Distillery equipment is custom made  </p>

<p>Our first treasure – the original Blackbeard frying pan – has been delivered in December 2018 and January 2019, and many backers were thrilled. We received some great feedback. Prior to the moment our backers received their Blackbeards, we surprised some of them last autumn. We delivered the first Blackbeards in person as a way to say “thanks” to our crowd.

We never imagined our initial goal of €50.000 would turn into €332.437 so fast: more than 3,400 backers from across the seven seas helped us bring the Blackbeard to life.That was just the beginning: after the end of our campaign, we launched the Blackbeard frying pan on Indiegogo for those who missed out on our Kickstarter campaign. On 1 November more than 273 backers pledged over €28.000.Ultimately, more than 800 backers provided us with feedback: they wanted more! In the spirit of the holidays, we created the Blackbeard Armada: a tribute to our backers and to the success of the Blackbeard. Again, our campaign became a great success: more than 2.000 backers pledged over €315.000. Amazing!Yet again, we receive many requests from our crowd: people are still eager to order items of our Blackbeard Armada set. Therefore, we launched our campaign on Indiegogo InDemand. You can preorder your cookware items, but don’t hesitate for too long. Our campaign is only running for a limited time. 
Crowd Cookware is based upon a community of thousands of food lovers. Together we develop, design and create new chef-grade products that otherwise would only be available to the famous brands we all know.
Our first treasure – the original Blackbeard frying pan – has been delivered in December 2018 and January 2019, and many backers were thrilled. We received some great feedback. Prior to the moment our backers received their Blackbeards, we surprised some of them last autumn. We delivered the first Blackbeards in person as a way to say “thanks” to our crowd. Check out the great response and find out how the Blackbeard arrived at Kickstarter’s HQ.
Below you can read a few comments backers left behind on our page.

Patron-cuisinier chef Johan van Groeninge - Restaurant: Avant-Garde van Groeninge * (One Michelin star) 
 
 Food connects, especially when it’s shared with others. Surprise a loved one and give away one of our Blackbeard Armada items as a ‘future gift’. We’ve recorded a short video in which you can see me – Tacco – and the one who taught me everything about cooking – my mother.Pre-order one of our fleet essentials and share this video: amaze someone else!We believe the cookware industry needs pirates. That’s how we originally came up with our first hack: the Blackbeard. A unique collaboration between our crowd, Michelin star chefs and manufacturers working for the world’s best-known brands. High-quality pans usually do not come cheap. A lot of the price is taken up by marketing activities, distribution networks, and local agencies, which mainly focus on brand positioning and do not necessarily reflect the quality of the pan. We are working together with our crowd to create another smuggling route that evades the big brands. The Blackbeard Armada will be manufactured by the same producers as the famous brands we all know. But instead of paying for the big-brand frills, we are only paying for chef-grade manufacturing. This makes the complete Armada fleet available for a fair price. All resources go into the quality of our products: that’s why we haven’t recruited native speaking actors for our crowdfunding video :).The days of sticking food and organizing cookware in the kitchen are over. The Blackbeard Armada is carefully assembled, consisting of chef-grade frying pans, saucepans, deep casseroles and a lid for the Blackbeard frying pan. A complete fleet of stackable cookware; with an eye for design and easily stored due to the compact design. While being optimized for ease of use for cooks of all levels: whether you’re an ambitious home cook or a Michelin star chef.Thanks to the stainless steel honeycomb pattern that protrudes above the non-stick coating, the Armada pans are scratch-resistant and extremely suitable for intensive use. Forget regular non-stick layers that start to wear out after 1 to 2 years of use – or even faster, and where the coating layer ends up in your food. The honeycomb pattern extends the lifespan of the current non-stick layers to at least 5 years.Our quality isn't just premium: our frying pans, saucepans, deep casseroles and lid can measure up to quality demands of top chefs. The three-layer construction forms the canvas for the honeycomb pattern that is etched into it. The dimples are then filled with a PTFE Whitford non-stick coating that is PFOA-free. We have thoroughly tested our coating and our pans have received a PASS for all tests with excellent test results.We have designed the pans with a 2.6 mm thick surface, which consists of three layers: a stainless steel bottom layer, an aluminum layer and another mirror polished stainless steel layer as a finish. This technique makes the pans suitable for all heat sources and very energy-efficient.The Blackbeard is not like any other non-stick pan. Before cooking like a real pirate, here’s how to use our wild & rugged mate:
Slowly heat up the pan over low heat. The aluminum core is a great heat conductor and gets hot very fast.
Use enough oil.

 When you hold the Blackbeard - a member of the Armada - for the first time, you can feel and see the quality we had in mind. That’s exactly what we wanted you to experience again when holding the different cookware essentials of our Blackbeard Armada. The pans are not too light, but certainly not too heavy. The mirror polishing of our pans provides a glorious and ultimate cooking experience. SmileEarly on in our first campaign, many pirates asked us about a lid for the Blackbeard frying pans. It’s upon their request that we’ve come up with a lid to control heat easily and preserve flavor, while reducing oil splatter at the same time: the Tricorne. A compact and modern mirror polished stainless steel lid that matches the design of the Blackbeard ø28 cm/11” frying pan and wok perfectly and can be stored and cleaned easily. The lid also has a steam vent to let steam escape, so the lid doesn’t bang around.Serve your meals in style with the Tricorne: use the lid like a cloche to cover your dish, causing surprise and expectation among your guests.Top chefs know better than anyone what it takes to create the perfect pan. That’s why we took their advice on board and designed several handles for our Blackbeard Armada. The handles of the Blackbeard frying pans, Queen Anne’s saucepans and Concord casseroles are made of solid cast stainless steel. The handles of the frying pans are riveted onto the pans and we’ve decided to use the same handles - adjusted in size - for the saucepans. After extensive testing, we made a choice to use welded handles for both the lid and the deep casseroles. Instead of one handle, our deep casseroles have two small handles that perfectly fit the minimalistic design and make the casseroles easy to store.Whether you’re pan-frying a thick steak, preparing a traditional beef stew or making a delicious gravy: you can prepare the dish of your choice for every occasion and create a chef-grade meal with the Blackbeard Armada cookware.The road to perfection took a long time during which we carefully looked at the design process, so that craftsmanship, design and love for cooking merge seamlessly. Piece by piece we put together our fleet, using the successful techniques of the original Blackbeard. For our first campaign, we tested the prototypes of the Blackbeard extensively within our community until we had the pan that fits perfectly with what our crew of pirates wants. We rigorously tested prototypes of the Blackbeard with a very wide range of foodies. Among other things, we discovered that stainless steel thickness less than 2mm is suboptimal, but when it’s more than 3mm, the frying pan becomes too heavy for convenient handling. We found the perfect thickness to be 2.6mm. We tested a huge range of handles, because the importance of the handle can’t be underestimated: it provides control and is closely linked to the pleasure of cooking. We also extensively tested how far the Blackbeard honeycomb coating should reach for maximum effect, leaving an area near the rim untouched. Last but not least: we bent the edge of the Blackbeard, but we finally put it upright. This allows you to pour without worrying about spillage. Both the saucepans and deep casseroles are designed using the successful techniques of the original Blackbeard frying pans, including a 2.6mm three-layer construction, honeycomb pattern and mirror polish.As middlemen of the global cookware industry, we got to know the manufacturers who produce for renowned brands, allowing us to get to know the ins and outs of this industry. We wanted to turn the tide by working from the inside, so we signed a partnership with a top-notch manufacturer. A rebellious ‘pan-whisperer’ who, like no other, is acquainted with all techniques and knows everything about creating the best pans, and has been doing so for many years for the world’s best-known brands. As the youngest member of a pans bakers’ guild, he wanted to break through the monopoly that generations before had adhered to.Looking back at our previous campaign, together we can literally do anything. Especially since more cookware manufacturers want to join us. Rather than having a rack filled with scratched, un-coated and excessive kitchen utensils, owning a few will give you the flexibility and the performance to cook whatever you want - even improving your cooking skillsAre you ready for a life of adventures and never-ending fun? The call of the sea is in the heart of every pirate who ever swashed a buckle. Become part of our community by kick-starting our Blackbeard Armada.

<h3>Our goal is to gift cold frosty treats, to hot dusty burners, often when they least expect it.</h3>
<p>We are a group of veteran and virgin burners from California and beyond. (Video being uploaded)</p>
<p>It all started with a dream last year to bring liquid nitrogen (LN2) to the desert to gift ice cream for the citizens of Black Rock City.</p>
<p>Getting giant cryogenic tanks to Burning Man is no easy task, making ice cream with the nitrogen by hand is also not easy in the desert. Alas, we were unable to make it happen last year. We did provide tea and naan bread to many happy people from an air conditioned dome at Camp Noonaantea.</p>
<p>We spent the year researching and planning and finally have the equipment and experience to make it a reality! We are bringing 260 liters of nitrogen and a variety of bases like coconut milk, fresh fruit juices, and alcohol (21+ only!)</p>
<p>If you are able to donate it will help cover the cost of the nitrogen, ingredients, and trailer needed to get the tanks up to BRC.</p>
<p>There will be different flavors each day! Breakfast Cereal Ice Cream with milk, Coffee with chocolate covered espresso beans, cookie butter and smores, cheesecake ice cream, frozen mojitos, margaritas, Coladas, Jager and Red Bull, and many other crazy combinations.</p>
<p>Making ice cream with liquid nitrogen produces a smoother creamier texture than regular ice cream because the ice crystals that form are almost non existent.</p>
<p><strong>Even without any funding, we'll be on the playa making treats for the camps in our neighborhood.</strong> When we do reach our goal, we'll post the location in the guide so more people know we exist and can experience our delicious treats for themselves!</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need tanks:</p>
<p>Already purchased a tank and our nitrogen supplier has generously donated a 50 and 160 liter tank! We just need to pay for the nitrogen.</p>
<p>We need a trailer:</p>
<p>The rented cargo trailer will allow us to secure the tanks and transport everything to BRC and back safely!!</p>
<p>We need ingredients:</p>
<p>We will be making non-dairy ice cream so we don't have to worry about spoilage and keeping a large amount of the base cold. Fruit juice, coconut milk, and booze have all come out amazing at our early tasting parties.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We'll be gifting our flavors of the day to the citizens of Black Rock City Wednesday - Saturday. Citizens only need to bring their own cup/bowl/container and their spoons. We will also put it on a cookie, pie, or slice of cheese if you bring it.</p>
<p>If you aren't going to Burning Man, but would like to donate please do! We will be grateful for your support and will make sure you get some ice cream when we get back if you're local. Long distance supporters of $50 will get ice cream shipped to them when we return!</p>

<h2>Our Story:</h2>
<p>Last year we set out to build a small coffee bar with some really BIG dreams. We wanted a place that would feel like a holiday, a place for rich specialty coffee, decadent savory pastries and tasty treats, but most of all, a place for our local Burbank community to gather...  </p>

<p>Along our journey of building, our contractor turned unwell and was increasingly unable to work. Quickly 3 months of building turned into almost <i>a year.</i> There were too many days going by and we were getting nervous that we may not be able to stretch our loan long enough to get our doors open. We thought long and hard about our options and decided to ""wall off"" the front section of our coffee bar in order to make opeing quick. Space &amp; seating would have to come later. </p>
<p>(Below is a photo of ""The Palm"" in early stages of the build.... Whoa! It's come a long way!)</p>

<p>The goal was always to apply for seating permits and build a small intimate seating area for our customers to stay, relax and enjoy a good cup of coffee with a friend or sit with a journal in the quiet moments before a busy work day. </p>

</strong><p><strong>Short
Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>Hi, my name is Fern
Lashley. I am one of the caretakers (together with Lucille Lambert) of a tropical fruit farm located at Claremont, in the
southwestern area of Antigua, West Indies. I have decided to launch this
crowdfunding campaign in order to raise funds for fences to protect this tropical fruit farm against the plague of
<strong><em><em>PRAEDIAL LARCENY</em></em></strong>. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>WHAT ON EARTH IS
PRAEDIAL LARCENY?</strong> </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Praedial larceny is an act of theft. It is when a person steals fruit, vegetables, livestock or even farm equipment from a farm. This is frustrating to say the least for farmers and farm owners.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p>
<p>Praedial Larceny <u>is not a petty crime but an organized crime which is negatively affecting the sustainability of the agriculture sector in Antigua</u>.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) conducted a comprehensive study, <b><i>An
Analysis of the State of Praedial Larceny in Member States of CARICOM</i></b>, where

FENCES:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The security fences are low
carbon steel wires which are galvanized after welding with a coating of zinc.
This zinc coating protects the fence from corrosion due to aging and weather. The
rectangular narrow openings make it impossible for fingers and toes to grab
(Anti-Climb) or difficult or impossible to cut (Anti-Cut). The fences require very little maintenance as they do not need to be painted or stained. They also cannot rust or rot. <strong>See an enlarged illustration of a security fence below, use with permission. </strong></p><p></p><strong>

Summary

Hi, my name is Fern
Lashley. I am one of the caretakers (together with Lucille Lambert) of a tropical fruit farm located at Claremont, in the
southwestern area of Antigua, West Indies. I have decided to launch this
crowdfunding campaign in order to raise funds for fences to protect this tropical fruit farm against the plague of
PRAEDIAL LARCENY. 
WHAT ON EARTH IS
PRAEDIAL LARCENY? 
Praedial larceny is an act of theft. It is when a person steals fruit, vegetables, livestock or even farm equipment from a farm. This is frustrating to say the least for farmers and farm owners.


Praedial Larceny is not a petty crime but an organized crime which is negatively affecting the sustainability of the agriculture sector in Antigua.
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) conducted a comprehensive study, An
Analysis of the State of Praedial Larceny in Member States of CARICOM, where
it was observed that ""conservative estimates are that 18% of the value of farm
output regionally is taken by thieves, resulting in the loss of millions of
United States dollars annually."" [Praedial Larceny in the Caribbean, FAO Subregional Office for the Caribbean Issue #3 July 2013, p. 2]
Please join our campaign to purchase security fences to protect
this tropical fruit farm from praedial larceny so that it can be successfully cultivated into a tropical organic fruit and vegetable farm using
sustainable agriculture methods. 
We would truly appreciate your generous contribution in helping
fence this tropical fruit farm with security fences and you would be joining the fight against praedial larceny in the Caribbean in general
and Antigua in particular.
THE PROJECT FOR FENCING THE TROPICAL FRUIT
FARM AT CLAREMONT ANTIGUA W.I. IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PHASES:

1. 
PHASE I - $40,000.00:  We hope to raise $40,000 to purchase security fences to protect two-third of the perimeter at the main asphalt road  which is equivalent to 285 security fences. The following pictures show part of the perimeter of the fruit farm at the main asphalt road that, hopefully with your help, will be fenced to deter praedial larcenists.2. 
PHASE II - $70,000.00: If we are successful with PHASE I, we will
continue to raise funds (inter alia through crowdfunding) to protect the rest of
the fruit farm perimeter. If we raised in PHASE II $70,000.00,
we will be able to purchase 500 security fences. Then this tropical fruit farm will be completely protected against praedial larceny.  DESCRIPTION OF THE SECURITY
FENCES:
The security fences are low
carbon steel wires which are galvanized after welding with a coating of zinc.
This zinc coating protects the fence from corrosion due to aging and weather. The
rectangular narrow openings make it impossible for fingers and toes to grab
(Anti-Climb) or difficult or impossible to cut (Anti-Cut). The fences require very little maintenance as they do not need to be painted or stained. They also cannot rust or rot. See an enlarged illustration of a security fence below, use with permission. 

THE SIZE OF
THE ANTI-CLIMB/ANTI-CUT SECURITY FENCE FRAME IS: 91” Wide X 98” High (Height 2.5m x Width
2.3m), the wire mesh is 0.5”x3” horizontal wire dia 0.157 inch vertical wire
dia 0.236 inch.
Post size is about:
122X3X2X0.10 inches (3100X80X60X2.5mm).

Caffeine forces body to ""forget"" sleepiness temporarily by tricking our brain, but it doesn't actually re-energize our body.
To create energy, we need to restore ATP.
 
Supherb's main ingredients have been clinically proven to ramp up ATP production, fundamentally raising our energy level.
 
 

 

 
Bo-yak, more than just tea
Bo-yak is a restorative herbal drink with 2000 years of tradition in Korea. Supherb is the first in market to modernize & bring this hidden-gem to world.
 

 
 

 

 
No one drinks 3-4 cups of coffee a day from beginning.
But how have we become so dependent on coffee everyday?
 
And even with several cups of coffee, why are we still tired?
Answer is in afternoon caffeine.
Caffeine stays in our body for a long time (it takes 6 hours for just half of caffeine to dissolve in body), disrupting our good night sleep and thus making us more tired next day. 
So what do we do about it? 
Supherb can help.
 
 

 

 
Supherb introduces a blend of best Asian herbs specialized for building stamina & long-term energy. It might not be as instant as caffeine, but good vitals gradually accumulates in body to help break vicious cycle*

<h3>DHM</h3>
<p>Morning Recovery is centered around <strong>Hovenia Dulcis</strong>, an Oriental raisin tree. It contains <strong>Dihydromyricetin (DHM) </strong>which has anti-hepatotoxic properties to help detoxify our body after alcohol poisoning.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498936692/zactmzlzs84kbihpotss.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>1. Toxins in your liver</h3>
<p>Alcohol undergoes a two-step process of metabolism in our liver:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498936744/elatfspnbcse7dgv88ag.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>A. </strong>First, our liver enzyme Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) converts Alcohol into metabolite called Acetaldehyde through oxidation. Acetaldehyde binds to proteins, and causes cellular inflammation; resulting in sweating, nausea and vomiting. Sound familiar?</p>
<p><b>B. </b>Luckily, our body is equipped with enzymes like Aldehyde-Dehydrogenase (ALDH) and glutathione that convert this toxic chemical into Acetic Acid that gets safely flushed out of our body.</p>
<p>Dihydromyricetin (DHM) works by increasing the ability of two key enzymes to function (ADH and ALDH), which speeds up the breakdown of Acetaldehyde into Acetic Acid. Consuming Morning Recovery allows your body to flush out acetaldehyde.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>2. Glutamate rebound in our brain</h3>
<p>In our brain, alcohol affects two neurotransmitters: Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) and Glutamate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498996571/nwaddurwztmsz5k5n48j.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Alcohol binds to GABA receptors, and increases GABA production, an inhibitor that causes relaxation, lowered inhibitions, slurred words and loss of motor control.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> This, in turn, suppresses the release of Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter that increases brain activity and energy levels. When you stop drinking, there's a rebound effect of glutamate production, which is why we fall asleep easily at first, but often wake up tired with anxiety.</p>
<p>Dihydromyricetin (DHM) binds to GABA receptors, and blocks the effect alcohol has on the brain. It minimizes the rebound effect our brain experiences after consuming alcohol.</p>

DHM
Morning Recovery is centered around Hovenia Dulcis, an Oriental raisin tree. It contains Dihydromyricetin (DHM) which has anti-hepatotoxic properties to help detoxify our body after alcohol poisoning.

1. Toxins in your liver
Alcohol undergoes a two-step process of metabolism in our liver:

A. First, our liver enzyme Alcohol Dehydrogenase (ADH) converts Alcohol into metabolite called Acetaldehyde through oxidation. Acetaldehyde binds to proteins, and causes cellular inflammation; resulting in sweating, nausea and vomiting. Sound familiar?
B. Luckily, our body is equipped with enzymes like Aldehyde-Dehydrogenase (ALDH) and glutathione that convert this toxic chemical into Acetic Acid that gets safely flushed out of our body.
Dihydromyricetin (DHM) works by increasing the ability of two key enzymes to function (ADH and ALDH), which speeds up the breakdown of Acetaldehyde into Acetic Acid. Consuming Morning Recovery allows your body to flush out acetaldehyde.
 
2. Glutamate rebound in our brain
In our brain, alcohol affects two neurotransmitters: Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA) and Glutamate.
 

 
A. Alcohol binds to GABA receptors, and increases GABA production, an inhibitor that causes relaxation, lowered inhibitions, slurred words and loss of motor control.
B. This, in turn, suppresses the release of Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter that increases brain activity and energy levels. When you stop drinking, there's a rebound effect of glutamate production, which is why we fall asleep easily at first, but often wake up tired with anxiety.
Dihydromyricetin (DHM) binds to GABA receptors, and blocks the effect alcohol has on the brain. It minimizes the rebound effect our brain experiences after consuming alcohol.

I want to share with you when and where Familia Español started, my first dishes, our vision and how you can be a part of Familia Español's journey. </p><p>      Familia Español has been a dream in the making for the past four years. I started the business from my kitchen in a two bedroom apartment in National City. The first foods I created for the menu were empanadas and Cuban sandwiches. Back then I would invite my family and friends to taste test my dishes. But I never really explained to them how big my dream is for Familia Español. </p><p>      Now I will explain to you all; the vision I have for Familia Español is to create a place where we can share the hispanic cultures  and enjoy unique authentic Hispanic dishes from around the world. You may be asking yourself “What Hispanic Cuisine exactly?” by this point. Well when it comes to people, Hispanic means a person who relates their roots to Spain or to Spanish-speaking countries. So when it comes to our menu it is inspired by dishes from Spain, Equatorial Guinea, and 19 countries from Latin America. Our choices for our menu are inspired to share a special flavor from each country showing their lifestyle choices in what they enjoy to eat. But besides our menu we will create an experience from our service that will make you feel like you are a part of La Familia. How will we do this you ask? We will serve you like you’re on vacationing at one of the 21 locations from the menu. We are digging deep by working alongside some of our locals that originate from the countries that we feature to learn how to best share the culture and the food. </p><p>     Just to be clear, my vision is to eventually open a restaurant but for now to get there we must take smaller steps to achieve the bigger goal, so with your support today you will be a part of our journey to be able to purchase our own food truck. We will be able to spread our message to be better known throughout San Diego, and we can start making these delicious dishes that your taste buds can experience. Also remember to make this dream a reality we are asking for your support, and it doesn’t all require for you to give money, so please share our message with your friends and family. We look forward to serving you soon, thank you.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>Our financial goal to fund the beginning of Familia Espanol's Food Truck is to be able to raise $25,000.

I want to share with you when and where Familia Español started, my first dishes, our vision and how you can be a part of Familia Español's journey.       Familia Español has been a dream in the making for the past four years. I started the business from my kitchen in a two bedroom apartment in National City. The first foods I created for the menu were empanadas and Cuban sandwiches. Back then I would invite my family and friends to taste test my dishes. But I never really explained to them how big my dream is for Familia Español.       Now I will explain to you all; the vision I have for Familia Español is to create a place where we can share the hispanic cultures  and enjoy unique authentic Hispanic dishes from around the world. You may be asking yourself “What Hispanic Cuisine exactly?” by this point. Well when it comes to people, Hispanic means a person who relates their roots to Spain or to Spanish-speaking countries. So when it comes to our menu it is inspired by dishes from Spain, Equatorial Guinea, and 19 countries from Latin America. Our choices for our menu are inspired to share a special flavor from each country showing their lifestyle choices in what they enjoy to eat. But besides our menu we will create an experience from our service that will make you feel like you are a part of La Familia. How will we do this you ask? We will serve you like you’re on vacationing at one of the 21 locations from the menu. We are digging deep by working alongside some of our locals that originate from the countries that we feature to learn how to best share the culture and the food.      Just to be clear, my vision is to eventually open a restaurant but for now to get there we must take smaller steps to achieve the bigger goal, so with your support today you will be a part of our journey to be able to purchase our own food truck. We will be able to spread our message to be better known throughout San Diego, and we can start making these delicious dishes that your taste buds can experience. Also remember to make this dream a reality we are asking for your support, and it doesn’t all require for you to give money, so please share our message with your friends and family. We look forward to serving you soon, thank you. What We Need & What You GetOur financial goal to fund the beginning of Familia Espanol's Food Truck is to be able to raise $25,000.

This keeps the egg from exploding, but you wind up with a rubbery egg. That's because the egg is being cooked by the microwaves themselves. It's not realy a boiled egg. It's more like the egg from an Egg McMuffin (mmmmm... :P ).</p><p>Besides, the American Egg Board says ""Piercing shells before cooking is not recommended. If not sterile, the piercer or needle can introduce bacteria into the egg. Also, piercing creates hairline cracks in the shell, through which bacteria can enter after cooking.""</p><h1>How does The Egg Cage work?</h1><p>The egg cage keeps the microwaves out in the same way the microwave oven keeps them in. Have you ever noticed the small holes you have to look through to see your food in the microwave oven? Those holes are in a metal sheet that, when combined with the other walls in microwave oven, form an impenetrable barrier to the microwaves. This barrier is called a Faraday Cage.</p><p>The Egg Cage is a basically a Faraday cage you can slip an egg into. When you use the cage in a mug of water, it keeps the microwaves out of the egg but still lets the boiling water reach the egg shell. The key to making a good Farraday cage is making sure the gaps between the wires are sufficiently small. The Egg Cage as been designed with small enough gaps to block virtually all the microwaves from entering the egg. In this way you get an egg that is truly boiled and will never explode or cook to a rubbery texture.</p><h2>Isn't it bad to put metal in the microwave?</h2><p>As a general rule, you should avoid putting metal objects in the microwave. Metal objects absorb more than their fair share of the microwaves and can become very hot. Also, if the metal has any sharp points exposed to air, it can cause sparks to form that can damage your microwave.</p><p>The Egg Cage is safe because it is submerged in water. The metal acts as an antenna for the microwaves, absorbing them and heating up. The water, however, prevents the metal from getting too far above boiling temperature so the egg doesn't overheat. The boiling water then cooks the egg (just like it does on the stove).</p><p>The water also prevents the metal from sparking. The Egg Cage is designed so that the wire ends sit near to the bottom of the mug. That means, even if much of the water boils off, they won't be exposed to the air to form sparks.</p><p>You should never run The Egg Cage in the microwave without water.</p><h1>How did you get to where you are?</h1><p>It took a lot of experimentation to find the right design and manufacturing method. We make The Egg Cage out of 100% stainless steel so it won't leech into the boiling water. There's evidence that aluminum and plastics shouldn't be used with boiling water.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">(this is one of our early prototypes)</span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/298548/files/20140108195015-IMG_2606.JPG?1389239415"" src="""" style=""width: 289.6px; height: 362px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Safety</h2><p>The Egg cage is dishwasher and microwave safe (when submerged in water in a microwave safe container).</p><p>Always ensure that The Egg Cage is submerged in water during operation. The Egg Cage is recommended to be used with the egg horizontal in a tall mug with a wide base. Shorter mugs will work but they often boil too vigorously in high-powered microwaves. This can cause the water to spill into onto the bottom surface of the microwave and, if left in the microwave too long, expose the metal cage to the air.

Just microwave the submerged cage for 3-6 minutes. For soft boiled eggs, replace the hot water with cold water and enjoy. For hard boiled eggs, let the egg sit in the water about 8 minutes after the microwave time. Here's a little video to make it clear:Why do I need a special device?Without The Egg Cage to block the microwaves, you could wind up with this happening (the exiting part is at 38 second)Some people avoid the explosions by cracking or piercing a hole in the shell. This keeps the egg from exploding, but you wind up with a rubbery egg. That's because the egg is being cooked by the microwaves themselves. It's not realy a boiled egg. It's more like the egg from an Egg McMuffin (mmmmm... :P ).Besides, the American Egg Board says ""Piercing shells before cooking is not recommended. If not sterile, the piercer or needle can introduce bacteria into the egg. Also, piercing creates hairline cracks in the shell, through which bacteria can enter after cooking.""How does The Egg Cage work?The egg cage keeps the microwaves out in the same way the microwave oven keeps them in. Have you ever noticed the small holes you have to look through to see your food in the microwave oven? Those holes are in a metal sheet that, when combined with the other walls in microwave oven, form an impenetrable barrier to the microwaves. This barrier is called a Faraday Cage.The Egg Cage is a basically a Faraday cage you can slip an egg into. When you use the cage in a mug of water, it keeps the microwaves out of the egg but still lets the boiling water reach the egg shell. The key to making a good Farraday cage is making sure the gaps between the wires are sufficiently small. The Egg Cage as been designed with small enough gaps to block virtually all the microwaves from entering the egg. In this way you get an egg that is truly boiled and will never explode or cook to a rubbery texture.Isn't it bad to put metal in the microwave?As a general rule, you should avoid putting metal objects in the microwave. Metal objects absorb more than their fair share of the microwaves and can become very hot. Also, if the metal has any sharp points exposed to air, it can cause sparks to form that can damage your microwave.The Egg Cage is safe because it is submerged in water. The metal acts as an antenna for the microwaves, absorbing them and heating up. The water, however, prevents the metal from getting too far above boiling temperature so the egg doesn't overheat. The boiling water then cooks the egg (just like it does on the stove).The water also prevents the metal from sparking. The Egg Cage is designed so that the wire ends sit near to the bottom of the mug. That means, even if much of the water boils off, they won't be exposed to the air to form sparks.You should never run The Egg Cage in the microwave without water.How did you get to where you are?It took a lot of experimentation to find the right design and manufacturing method. We make The Egg Cage out of 100% stainless steel so it won't leech into the boiling water. There's evidence that aluminum and plastics shouldn't be used with boiling water.(this is one of our early prototypes)SafetyThe Egg cage is dishwasher and microwave safe (when submerged in water in a microwave safe container).Always ensure that The Egg Cage is submerged in water during operation. The Egg Cage is recommended to be used with the egg horizontal in a tall mug with a wide base. Shorter mugs will work but they often boil too vigorously in high-powered microwaves. This can cause the water to spill into onto the bottom surface of the microwave and, if left in the microwave too long, expose the metal cage to the air. If at at any time you hear a buzzing sound, open the microwave and add more water to the cup. Only use with microwave safe containers.Egg cooking times may vary with egg size and microwave power.International supportersIf you want your perks shipped to an international address, please add $5 to your pledge ($10 if the mug is included)",2.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3>Uvod i počeci Pivovare Krigl:</h3>
<p>Koprivnica je jedna od najpoznatijih prijestolnica komercijalnih piva, a od nedavno se može i službeno pohvaliti i s craft pivom. Craft pivo i komercijalno pivo velikih pivovara nisu konkurencija - ponudom craft piva ugostitelji primarno dobivaju razlikovni moment širinom ponude, privlače goste koji do tada nisu dolazili u objekt te povećavaju ukupnu prodaju piva.

<h2>Are you ready for something unique?</h2>
<p>You might not always know what beer we will have on tap, but you’ll always know it’ll be good. Flavor, fun and quality are things we hope to bring to the already awesome Kansas City beer scene.</p>
<p>We will NOT have flagship beers. We WILL have awesome beer, though. We are hoping to focus on novelty, barrel-aged and innovative sour beers. We also will have craft soda!<br/><br/>Some of the beers we plan to brew the first year include our popular Rainbow Sorbet Sour, Smores Imperial Stout, a variety of smoothie style sours and several one-off, barrel-aged imperial stouts. We’ve been known to add all kinds of interesting things to our beers, including whole pumpkin pies, entire boxes of red velvet cake mix, chocolate chip cookies and much more.<br/><br/>We don’t like to brew the same thing over and over again. Instead, we like to push ourselves to see what the next crazy thing is that we can pull off. Have a crazy good idea? Share it with us!</p>

<p>Servaes Brewing Co. is the culmination of passion, hard work and persistence. Courtney began brewing in 2012 with a kettle, a propane burner and a few beer-loving friends. That casual hobby evolved into what can only be described as an obsession. Since then, Courtney has brewed hundreds of different beers, challenging herself to try new things, learn new styles and explore new and inventive flavor profiles. She has had the opportunity to participate in a few scale-ups at professional breweries and has won several awards for her homebrew. Awards and scale-ups include:</p>

<h2>The Plan and Timeline:</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539626787/h5ajr2bzxka8jjasil8z.png"" src=""""/><br/>Servaes Brewing Co. will be a 2,700-square-foot brewery and taproom located in downtown Old Shawnee.</p>
<p>We plan to have the taproom and brewery open to the public in spring 2019. We have filed for brewing permits and have begun renovations on our building. Our brewing system is on order and should be delivered in early 2019. We aim to have our grand opening in early spring 2019.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Why Shawnee?</h2>
<p>When we first started looking for a location for Servaes Brewing Company, we weren't married to a particular place. We just knew we wanted to be close to other breweries. We looked in Lawrence. We looked at the Crossroads. We looked in North Kansas City. We looked on Southwest Boulevard. </p>

</div></div>","Are you ready for something unique?
You might not always know what beer we will have on tap, but you’ll always know it’ll be good. Flavor, fun and quality are things we hope to bring to the already awesome Kansas City beer scene.
We will NOT have flagship beers. We WILL have awesome beer, though. We are hoping to focus on novelty, barrel-aged and innovative sour beers. We also will have craft soda!Some of the beers we plan to brew the first year include our popular Rainbow Sorbet Sour, Smores Imperial Stout, a variety of smoothie style sours and several one-off, barrel-aged imperial stouts. We’ve been known to add all kinds of interesting things to our beers, including whole pumpkin pies, entire boxes of red velvet cake mix, chocolate chip cookies and much more.We don’t like to brew the same thing over and over again. Instead, we like to push ourselves to see what the next crazy thing is that we can pull off. Have a crazy good idea? Share it with us!

Who are we?

Servaes Brewing Co. is the culmination of passion, hard work and persistence. Courtney began brewing in 2012 with a kettle, a propane burner and a few beer-loving friends. That casual hobby evolved into what can only be described as an obsession. Since then, Courtney has brewed hundreds of different beers, challenging herself to try new things, learn new styles and explore new and inventive flavor profiles. She has had the opportunity to participate in a few scale-ups at professional breweries and has won several awards for her homebrew. Awards and scale-ups include:

Courtney has a bachelor’s degree in mass media from Baker University and an MBA from Ottawa University. She currently works in marketing at the University of Kansas. In her free time, Courtney enjoys writing, cooking, traveling and spending as much time as possible with her wife, Brandi, and sons, Aaron, 12, and Dylan, 9 months.
Did you say craft soda?

We will ALWAYS have a craft soda (or two or three or four) on tap at the brewery for adults and children alike. Aaron has a list of 25 proposed sodas to make in 2019. Here are some of his favorites:

Butterscotch cream soda (inspired by Harry Potter’s Butterbeer!)
Peach cobbler cream soda
Pumpkin pie soda
Fruit punch soda
Smoked pineapple soda
Ghost pepper root beer


The Plan and Timeline:
Servaes Brewing Co. will be a 2,700-square-foot brewery and taproom located in downtown Old Shawnee.
We plan to have the taproom and brewery open to the public in spring 2019. We have filed for brewing permits and have begun renovations on our building. Our brewing system is on order and should be delivered in early 2019. We aim to have our grand opening in early spring 2019.

Why Shawnee?
When we first started looking for a location for Servaes Brewing Company, we weren't married to a particular place. We just knew we wanted to be close to other breweries. We looked in Lawrence. We looked at the Crossroads. We looked in North Kansas City. We looked on Southwest Boulevard. 
Eventually, we decided we cared more about what felt right than about whether there would be breweries nearby. We found the perfect location on Johnson Drive in Old Shawnee. As luck would have it, we soon found out we would not be the only brewery in Shawnee. Or the only brewery on Johnson Drive. We wouldn't even be the only brewery on Johnson Drive IN Shawnee.By the end of 2019, we're hoping Johnson Drive will have made a name for itself as another KC craft beer destination.

<h3>Vessel Meats</h3>
<p>Vessel Meats started very organically at the Alderney Landing Farmer's Market 5 years ago; when Brianna, who was working part time at a butcher shop began selling meat to her vegetable customers on Saturdays. </p>
<p>It has been 5 years, and in that time the business has grown to have 1 full time employee and operates out of several markets. The one thing Vessel Meats is lacking is A RETAIL BUTCHER SPACE OF OUR VERY OWN. </p>
<p>Vessel has grown to the point where we can't grow any further. We need a place to train staff, to educate customers, gain more autonomy over our product and MAKE OUR DELICIOUS MEATS available FULL TIME. In our own home we can expand our product line and make fresh local meat available every day of the week. </p>
<p>But to do this we need infrastructure. You need clean government certified facilities; you need walk in coolers and work space. And although we have been VERY lucky to rent these spaces from our friends thus far, we are outgrowing our shared space and it is time to move onward and upward (and into the city!)</p>
<p>Building this space is no small feat. Brianna has been working on it tirelessly full time for over a year. (as many of you know). But we have found a place that we think will suit us up on Primrose Street, in North Dartmouth. </p>
<p>It has been 5 years since Brianna first packed up her meats at 4 am and trucked them in to Dartmouth and now it is time to build a full time space in the same community we started in. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Building a butchery from the ground up is no small feat! The space on Primrose is literally an empty canvas, where we will be building every piece of infrastructure in the space. Although we have most of the funds for this project there are a few things that require additional funding.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is a butcher shop without a meat rail? Since we work with whole carcasses having a rail system and loading door makes everything a lot easier to manage. It is SAFER for the staff as it will carry the brunt of the weight that otherwise is literally put onto the backs of humans. The cost of having the rail built and the ceiling reinforced to carry the weight has been quoted at $30 000. </li>
<li>BACON - we NEED a smoker for bacon! A smoker is currently scheduled into the second phase of the project and is a service we currently contract out from another local third party. Having our own will allow us more autonomy over the quality of our product and enable us to manage costs associated with contracting out this work. Approximate cost is $10 000. </li>
<li>We tried to design our perks so there would be something for everyone. Non-locals can support us by purchasing a tshirt or a tote bag which we can ship anywhere! We are also offering meat packages for your freezer or back yard BBQ as well as various classes in the shop or in your home! </li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the cost of this entire project it has been designed in phases. The first phase and build is to get the craft butchery built and off the ground. If we don't meet the goal? If we can't afford the rail system then there is more heavy lifting and hand bombing work. The smoker will have to wait for 2-3 years until we have found our footing. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Vessel Meats started very organically and grew because THE COMMUNITY supported it. There are not enough butchers in Nova Scotia who are working with local farmers to help them grow better products. There are not enough butchers in Nova Scotia dedicating their energy to dedicated local sourcing for the consumers. We pride ourselves on sourcing all our meat directly from Nova Scotia farms and doing our best to bring delicious, healthy, sustainable meat to our community. </p>
<p>Vessel Meats, until this point has built our business slowly, but surely. We have gradually built the business based in farmer's markets, over the past 5 years. The more conversations we have the more people want to talk, and see, and know about where there food is coming from. We pride ourselves on using local ingredients from Nova Scotia suppliers. We take our time to mix all our spices by hand and create everything in small batches. Over 5 years the people have encouraged us time and again. Now it's time to make our current products available full time and expand to create new products. </p>
<p>Currently we are only available at the Farmer's Market on Saturday and Sunday, which is the maximum our current permits allow. Building a full retail and production facility in our community will allow us not only to make our products available full time, it will also allow us to;</p>
<ul>
<li>Expand our training and create full time employment opportunities. We are ready to hire and train another butcher but this is unsustainable until we have a full time retail facility. </li>
<li>Provide educational opportunities. We really believe in connecting farmers to our community. This project will allow us to provide space for farmers to talk to the community about sustainable farming practices and provide information about farming practices in Nova Scotia. </li>
<li>Expand our product line. In a full retail facility we will be able to expand on the products we currently produce and create new ones! </li>
<br/> </ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Building a small scale butcher shop doesn't come without challenges. We pride ourselves on paying fair pricing to all of our suppliers - without farmers we have no food! But paying local farmers fair pricing means we often are paying a higher then ""market value"" - competing against big time processors. This means that our products may cost more then the average ""grocery store"" meat. But our experience time and again tells us that Nova Scotia and it's citizens are ready for quality vs quantity when it comes to the meat they consume. </p>
<p>The long term scope of this project is to expand the business into an operational deli as well. Although the butchery/deli is very common in other parts of the country they don't seem to exist on the East Coast. We have seen first hand how they operate in other parts of Canada and are confident that we too, can and want to eat, local artisinal products grown by neighbours in our province. Although it will take some trailblazing; our experience already has shown us that if you keep putting one foot in front of the other anything is possible. </p>
<h3>The Delivery</h3>
<p>As we have learned, getting this project to this point; things can often take longer then we think! That's why we have spread our rewards out over a period of time based on the building phases of the project and us getting comfortable in our new home. TShirts and Tote bags can be shipped once they are printed and we don't need the butchery to deliver those rewards. Packages and steaks will be available once we open our doors (anticipated June 2020) and classes will be offered in the fall and winter (2020/2021) as we get settled into our new space and are comfortable welcoming others into our shop!</p>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Brianna started her journey learning about butchery 6 years ago when she started working part time in a custom and retail butcher shop to ""learn about meat"". Over time (not over night :) ) she fell in love with the trade and started Vessel Meats in her free time to help bring local, ethical meat into her community. <br/>Vessel Meats allowed her to hone her skills and put her own twist on various meat products. Over the next 5 years, she visited various farms and butcher shops including an all-female meat camp in Texas, a month spent in various shops in Montreal, and appearing on the first season of The Butcher (History Channel S01E01).

And it's made of leather, so it's a much better gift for a man than some of the wine totes I've looked at that are to feminine, although it is a great gift for any wine lover.""</em><br/>– SunDawg</p>
<p><em>""We LOVE this wine holder. We take it with us whenever we need to transport wine, for dinner, to a BYOB, on picnics or when visiting friends. The insert keeps chilled wine cold too. It never fails that when we have it, someone stops us to admire our bag. We have given this exact bag to many friends. It makes a great gift for the wine enthusiast. Love it!""</em><br/>– ShoeGal</p>

</center></div>","CAMPAIGN OVERVIEWAre you tired of your favorite wine turning warm too quickly? Do you leave your wine at home because you do not have an easy way of carrying it?Introducing CaraVino and Tote duo Vino wine totes by ChillnJoy. These portable cooling solutions will chill your wine in just 30 minutes and keep it chilled up to six hours. The products can also be used with various bottle sizes including champagne, sparkling wine, water, and alcohol.                                                                                   OUR STORYI’m Joy, President of ChillnJoy.  I’ve always had the entrepreneurial spirit in me, just like my father did, who came to the U.S. from Italy. The idea of these products is to cool beverages quickly, and keep them cool for a long period of time without the need for refrigeration.  The quality and craftsmanship are top of the line. I take the totes to places I really enjoy such as picnics, parties, restaurants, beaches, friend’s houses, and even when I'm at home. &lt;br&gt; 

Make your wine portable with the elegant CaraVino iceless chiller and leather wine tote by ChillnJoy. It couldn’t be easier.  Simply place the iceless chiller in a freezer for at least 4 hours. When ready for use, remove it from the freezer and place a bottle of your favorite wine directly into the chiller.  Put the chiller and bottle in the elegant, soft-sided leather tote, zip it up, and you’re off! The technology will chill a bottle of wine in 30 minutes, and keep its cool for up to 6 hours.
 

 
 

A bag with a dual personality. Chill your wine on both sides.  It comes with 2 black chillers, multi-functional corkscrew bottle opener and foil cutter, an adjustable shoulder strap, and large pockets on either side to conveniently fit wine glasses or other accessories. It can even safely hold up to 4 bottles simply by removing the chillers, and is machine washable.
The bag zips apart to become 2 individual bags – each with a carrying handle.


“I bought this as a gift for a co-worker who loves wine, traveling (car trips) and bring your own wine restaurants. He already receives so many bottles of wine for the holidays and other special occasions, that I thought this would be a thoughtful companion gift for all the other wine gifts he receives. Of course, I also included a nice bottle of wine inside! He uses it a lot and loves it” – Averose
“This is a great product for taking wine on the go. The core chilled nicely in the freeze and kept our wine chilled a long time. We frequently take wine to BYOB restaurants or over to parties and get compliments wherever we go! One of our chiller cores did eventually crack and had to be replaced, but that was after at least six years of owning it. The attached accessories are very helpful as well.”– Lanette
“I love the look and feel of the product. It is the perfect added touch for our VIP guests as they enter their hotel rooms. They are selling very quickly in the gift shop”– Amy V., Hyatt Regency
""I love, love, love this thing! Being a wine connoisseur, I take it with me to restaurants often so I can have my favorite wine. I know the temperature will be ideal when I get there.”– Marcio P.
""Perfect carry-all for any wine lover. One awesome part of the tote is the chiller. It is great to be able to carry your wine and keep it chilled. It is durable and sturdy, and looks magnificent when traveling. The genuine leather adds to the style. I just luv the black. It’s very stylish!""– Appaloosa
“This is a great product and I am pleased to receive such a prompt and positive response to my questions. Your company will be a prosperous enterprise for many years. You have given me a great story to tell my friends as they inquire about my product.” – Tim P.
""I received this wine tote for a gift a few years ago. I use it often and love it. Just purchased another one for a friend who always admires my tote. Great quality. Great Gift! Perfect to take to B.Y.O.B dinners.""– Bzus
""I have one for myself and I love the fact that you can keep wine chilled. Red or White wines - this is perfect!!!! Gave this as gifts and received rave reviews. If you need a gift for anyone that drinks wine - order this.""– Andid
""I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend who's a wine lover. It's very well made, has nice accessories, and has a cooler insert that you can put in the freezer to keep the wine cold when it's in transit. I think he'll like it a lot. And it's made of leather, so it's a much better gift for a man than some of the wine totes I've looked at that are to feminine, although it is a great gift for any wine lover.""– SunDawg
""We LOVE this wine holder. We take it with us whenever we need to transport wine, for dinner, to a BYOB, on picnics or when visiting friends. The insert keeps chilled wine cold too. It never fails that when we have it, someone stops us to admire our bag. We have given this exact bag to many friends. It makes a great gift for the wine enthusiast. Love it!""– ShoeGal
""This wine tote has sturdy construction and is practical when transporting room temperature or chilled wine. The two separate compartments can be zipped together to carry two bottles or, if you need only a single tote you can unzip them and take only one.""– QSurfer
""I received my leather wine tote yesterday. My husband and I were so pleased with the design and quality, we immediately got online to order another for an additional gift for a friend.""– Janey S.
""My mother gave this to my husband and I as a gift at Christmas and we LOVE it! We have had no problems with it so far, and have received rave reviews from our friends at all of the events we have brought it to. Since it keeps the wine chilled for about 8 hours, and looks super stylish we often bring it to after work and weekend parties. This is well worth the money and is sure bet for wine lovers.""– Tellicus
“It is really good quality and sturdy. Very pleased with it!”– Ross6

[ INTEGRITY ] Since day one our goal was to create a product with a purpose to create awareness for a local or global cause, as our competitors are only concern about their bottom line we are concern about global and local issues.
[ INNOVATION ] We put sweat and blood into everything we do from product to packaging! The best is yet to come!
[ TACTICALLY ] Over the past 12 months we've been taking the punches from growing our branch organically and everything we do has a tactic behind it.

<h3>Hello, we are BrewDog.</h3>
<p>In 2007, <a href=""https://www.brewdog.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BrewDog</a>  was born on the rugged coast of North East Scotland. Over the past 10 years, we have grown to become UK's best selling craft beer, we export to 60 countries and we run 49 bars across the world. We started out with a mission to make other people as passionate about great craft beer as we are, and that's still our mission today.</p>
<p>Our first craft brewery in the US launched this year in Columbus, Ohio. We are now offering the opportunity to get involved in the world's first <strong>crowdfunded craft beer hotel</strong>, attached to a brand new <strong>sour beer facility,</strong> all located on our site in Columbus. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488191072/yr6mvp9dpwgzvzq3inyb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>By supporting this project, you will be staking your claim on one of our most ambitious projects to date. This hotel will provide a complete experiential environment in which to truly immerse yourself in the world of craft beer. From waking up to a view of our sour beer foeders and the smell of freshly mashed malt, to hop-infused spa treatments and beer breakfasts, and even amazing craft beer on tap in your bedroom - this hotel will have it all.</p>

<h3>Why The DogHouse?</h3>
<p>We want to create the top craft beer destination on the planet. Our brewery in Ellon, Scotland has become a destination for craft beer fans across Europe, and we want to build an even more amazing beer destination stateside. With The DogHouse focused on amazing craft beer from BrewDog and our favourite breweries worldwide, we're creating the ideal environment in which to immerse yourself in the ultimate beery weekend.<br/><br/>Forget Disneyland. This is the new happiest (or hoppiest) place on Earth.</p>

<p>Sour brewing provides the opportunity to experiment and innovate with the weirdest, most wonderful styles of beer the world has to offer. By building a dedicated sour beer facility on site at our brewery in Columbus, Ohio, we're setting ourselves up to start building some insane recipes without impacting on our day-to-day brewing. <br/> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The BrewDog hotel &amp; sour beer brewery will cost $6million to build and furnish, and the proceeds of this campaign will enable us to fast track the project through to completion. As you can see, the designs are well underway and we should have these finalized by June 2017. The build will then be accelerated in order for the hotel to be operational by Q3 2018. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488205172/euknv9wmexzp8whhneh3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>DogHouse will have craft beer at its core. We have already started work developing some craft beer spa treatments, with bespoke hop oils (to emulate your favorite beers) and malted barley massages, as well as a 'hoppy feet' pedicure to put a spring in your step before a brewery tour! Fully immerse yourself in the world of craft beer during your stay, enjoy craft beer infused breakfasts, lunches and dinners, with beers paired to every course. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>BrewDog owns the land on which we intend to construct The DogHouse, and we have established great connections with the City of Canal Winchester. The local authorities are fully supportive of our mission and goals in the region, and the brewery is located just 10 miles away from downtown Columbus with plenty of travel links on our doorstep. Although this will be our first hotel worldwide, we have an expert retail division with extensive experience in the hospitality and hotel industries.</p>

<p> Kula is a sanskrit word which means community of choice or heart. I started making vegan cheese in my kid’s closet a year ago. Since then, through the will of the community, we have grown into a full-fledged rapidly expanding business. In order to get our products to more locations, near you, we need help. </p>
<p>We re-invest every cent in the company and have been going without heat just to keep going. When you help us today you will be helping us pay to get the additional product testing done so we can launch more of our products, source sustainable packaging and hire some help in the kitchen. </p>
<p>We are trying to raise $55,000 </p>
<p>This amount will solve all of our immediate growth needs and set us up to keep growing. The money for a good quality heating/air system will allow us to work in greater comfort and better regulate temperatures for fermentation.</p>
<p>The money for two part-time salaries will allow us to expand exponentially. With more help we will be able to create more products, sell more products and grow. </p>

</div></div>","Hi! I’m Chef Shel Leigh or Michelle, whichever you prefer to call me. I have a Master’s degree in Education, am a certified plant-based chef, and a woman with a vision. I want to make it easier to be healthy by bringing my line of plant-based gluten-free products to a store near you. 
 Kula is a sanskrit word which means community of choice or heart. I started making vegan cheese in my kid’s closet a year ago. Since then, through the will of the community, we have grown into a full-fledged rapidly expanding business. In order to get our products to more locations, near you, we need help. 
We re-invest every cent in the company and have been going without heat just to keep going. When you help us today you will be helping us pay to get the additional product testing done so we can launch more of our products, source sustainable packaging and hire some help in the kitchen. 
We are trying to raise $55,000 
This amount will solve all of our immediate growth needs and set us up to keep growing. The money for a good quality heating/air system will allow us to work in greater comfort and better regulate temperatures for fermentation.
The money for two part-time salaries will allow us to expand exponentially. With more help we will be able to create more products, sell more products and grow. 
The money “earmarked” for testing will allow us to create HACCP plans and test our mushroom jerky and mushroom meat products. 
New market gear is needed before the next farmer’s market season which starts in late March. We want to purchase sustainable electric coolers, signage, and displays.  If we don’t reach our funding goals any monies earned will be spent in the order listed: heat, salaries, testing, market gear. $8000 will go for heat/air system for the Kula Kitchen
20,000 part-time salary 
20,000 part-time salary
$2,000 New Market Gear 
$5,000 Product Testing and Packaging For helping with our campaign you’ll be the first to receive our exclusive products. 
$50 contribution = powder pack (includes our powdered cheese, coco mix, and brownie mix)
$100 contribution = Lg. Powder pack (includes our powdered cheese, coco mix, brownie mix, pancake mix and waffle mix)
$500 contribution = Refrigeration pack (5 powders + refrigerated cashew cheese sampler pack)
$1000 contribution = Lg Powder pack & Refrigeration pack PLUS all new Kula products for life! Anytime Chef Shel Leigh creates a new product (which is several times a year)...you will be the first to receive it and invited to provide feedback, help name and market the product.

<p></p></div>","With lessons learned, Pruno & Hooch has partnered with Homeboy Industries to provide high-risk, formerly gang-involved inmates, counseling and support to enter back into society as contributing members of our communities.
A portion of pledged funds will go directly to Homeboy Industries.Joe Davis, the Co-founder of Pruno & Hooch had the unfortunate and fortunate experience of spending time in jail. Prior to prison, Joe was the executive producer for the movie BOTTLE SHOCK; an award winning film that tells the true story of Chateau Montelena, and how it launched Napa Valley as a wine community. So what does Joe do after serving his time of 5 1/2 months? He brings home and creates an American heritage brand; capitalizing on 100 year old iconic brands, pruno & hooch, that have been inside the prison systems. Pruno has been around for over a century, and is known west of the Mississippi. This prison made alcohol east of the Mississippi is known as hooch. It has been an inmate staple for inside prison walls for centuries. Both are alcoholic beverages made by prisoners for prisoners. Hidden from the guards and prison wardens, pruno and hooch is stashed under the inmates’ bunks, inside walls and toilets, or in the shower area. VOTE! The coast with the most funds raised will be host to the Exclusive Pruno & Hooch After Party. By making a $2 pledge or ""vote"", your $2 pledge will be your ticket in, should your coast come on top.

Inmates make their “wines” with scraps of apples, oranges, fruit cocktail, ketchup, sugar, milk, and other ingredients, they can smuggle into their cells. Bread provides the yeast for the Pruno or Hooch to ferment, then turning it into alcohol. The concoction can be made using only a plastic bag, hot running water, and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation. A dangerous undertaking for a prisoner... but in the end, much worth the risk for a coveted glass of Pruno or Hooch! This historical, classic beverage, originating from prisoners, is now a concept bottled with delicious California juice. It can be purchased at your local Mom & Pop shops. Pruno & Hooch Moscato will be a third wine product. Moscato is by far, the fastest-growing wine varietal in the United States marketplace today, and especially among the millennial generation and urban demo-graphic.Anything but homemade.To the contrary, while the brand harkens back to a dark memory, the present-day Pruno & Hooch wines will be professionally bottled, attractively bottled, well-priced and wonderful wines. All of the juice will come from California, from delicious grapes. With an unbeatable price tag, equaling the same price as a 20 oz. Red Bull. Support Pruno & Hooch by pledging for some of the rewards below. Pruno & Hooch Money Roll - 2 for $5DESCRIPTION: The Pruno & Hooch money roll band.

müssen aufklären!</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Jeden Tag wird über die 
AfD-Partei berichtet und ich frage mich, ob die Befürworter der AfD eine
Ahnung davon haben was sie da wählen? Und ich frage mich, was unser Land
dagegen tut? </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><u style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Auszug aus dem Wahlprogramm:</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Gender-Mainstreaming abschaffen, Euro abschaffen, EU-Austritt, Grenzen
schließen, Flüchtlinge abschieben, Ehen stabilisieren, ideologiefreie LGBT- freie Kindererziehung,
Jungen fördern,<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  Frauenquote abschaffen,

<p>Die AfD-Partei (Alternative für Deutschland) gewinnt an Zuwachs...
derzeit 10% und mehr. Weil kaum einer das Wahlprogramm im Detail kennt.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Und wenn wir in unserem Land dieser rechtspopulistischen Partei
kein Mitspracherecht geben wollen, müssen wir selbst aktiv werden und uns nicht
auf unsere Politiker verlassen. Die haben derzeit genügend andere Probleme.</p>
<p><u>Und wieso gewinnt die AfD Partei immer mehr Wähler? </u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Weil die neuen Anhänger der AfD-Partei oftmals unwissende Protestwähler
sind! Unwissend, weil die nach außen getragenen Wahlslogans vom Wahlprogramm massiv
abweichen.  Auf den Plakaten steht zum
Beispiel nur „Familie stärken“, aber das LGBT feindliche Wahlprogramm dahinter
steht nicht dabei.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mag sein, dass unsere derzeitige Regierung nicht immer eine
Glanzleistung hingelegt hat, auch nicht in der Flüchtlingskrise... aber mal
ehrlich: Welches Land bzw. welche dahinter stehende Regierung kann sich auf ein
solches Szenario vorbereiten? Kein Land und keine Regierung kann das.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Nehmen wir mal an die AfD wäre an der Macht? Würde es unserer
Nation damit besser gehen? Schauen wir doch mal aktuell in unser Nachbarland
nach Polen, dann wissen wir was uns blühen wird, wenn die AfD in Deutschland an
Zuwachs gewinnt. Wir müssen aufklären!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Natürlich bringt die Flüchtlingskrise auch Probleme mit sich. Aber
mit Motzen wird das auch nicht besser. Probleme muss man lösen und man löst
eine Flüchtlingskrise nicht mit rechtsradikaler Propaganda und schon garnicht mit
Grenzzäunen. Es geht immer noch um Menschenleben.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wollen wir, dass die Alternative für Deutschland in Landtagen oder
im Bundesstag Mitspracherecht bekommt? Wollen wir noch mehr unaufgeklärte
Wähler an die AfD verlieren?</p>
<p><b>2. Was ist
unser Ziel? Was müssen wir erreichen?</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Wir müssen Protestwähler vermeiden. Müssen über das homophobe, frauenfeindliche, ausländerfeindliche, europafeindliche Wahlprogramm aufklären.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wir wollen AfD-Protestwähler vermeiden! Wir sind parteilos aber
wir machen den Mund auf!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wir klären über das rechtspopulistische Wahlprogramm der AfD-Partei
auf. Online und auf der Straße. Wir wollen Deutschland aufzeigen, was im Detail
hinter der AfD-Partei steckt. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Protest gegen die AfD-Partei begegnet man derzeit hauptsächlich
nur online im Social-Media Bereich. Auf der Straße sieht man zwar Gegendemos,
aber reicht das aus? </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Das müssen wir dringend ändern! Derzeitige Online-Diskussionen bspw.
auf Facebook sind zwar hilfreich, erreicht aber viele Menschen in unserem Land
nicht.  Nicht weil die Menschen kein
Internet haben, sondern weil nicht alle Menschen an Online Diskussionen
teilnehmen wollen.</p>
<h2><b>Machen wir den Mund auf! #noafd</b></h2>

<b>2.1. Das passiert mit deiner

Partei unser Land mitregiert.</p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p><u><b>Gegenwerbung:</b></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Überall dort wo die AfD-Partei Werbung macht, platzieren wir
Gegenwerbung in Form von Plakaten und Aufstellern. Diese Werbung soll Menschen
zum Umdenken bewegen, im Kopf bleiben und darf auch belustigen. Keine
Straßenzüge mehr nur mit alleiniger AfD- Wahlkampfwerbung! </p>
<p>Die AfD-Partei darf kein Mitspracherecht in
unserem Land erhalten.</p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p><u><b>Demonstrationen:</b></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Die AfD-Partei ruft ihre Anhänger zu Demonstrationen auf.
Gewalttätig gehen die AfD Anhänger gegen die Presse vor und demonstriert auf
Straßen. Redner versuchen mit rechtspopulistischen Äußerungen und Propaganda
Menschen in Ihren Bann zu ziehen. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wir müssen dagegen halten, aufklären und dagegen demonstrieren.  Wir organisieren und mobilisieren zu Gegendemos
und bewerben diese aktiv. </p>
<p><u><b>Aufklärungsarbeit in den Fußgängerzonen:</b></u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Zusammen mit Helfern werden wir in den Fußgängerzonen aktiv

erhalten. </p>

<p><b>3. Aufklärung: Wahlprogramm der AfD im Detail</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Ich behaupte, dass nur ein Bruchteil der AfD-Wähler die
Landtagswahlprogramme im Detail gelesen hat. Ich habe mir das 64-Seitige
Landtagswahlprogramm in Baden-Württemberg und die andere Wahlprogramme der AfD durchgelesen
und bin schockiert. Willkommen in der Steinzeit.</span></p>
<p>Selbst ehemalige AfD Mitglieder wie bspw. Hans-Olaf Henkel sagen
mittlerweile: </p>
<p>„Anständige können die AfD nicht mehr wählen.“ </p>
<p>„Die AfD hat einen extrem hohen Anteil von gescheiterten
Existenzen.“</p>

<p>usw.</p>
<p>Ich fasse hier nur Auszüge zusammen, AfD Originaltexte in kursiv:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Die
AfD beharrt darauf, dass es das Recht und die Aufgabe eines souveränen Staates
ist, selbst zu bestimmen, wer seine Grenzen überschreitet und wer sich
dauerhaft auf seinem Territorium aufhalten darf. Diesem Recht mit umfassenden
Grenzkontrollen und notfalls auch mit Grenzzäunen Geltung zu verschaffen, ist
ein elementares Gebot staatspolitischer Vernunft und Verantwortung.</i></p>
<p>-&gt; Grenzzäune? Nein Danke!</p>
<p></p><div style=""text-align: justify;""><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Jeder
soll nach seiner Façon selig werden, aber niemandem darf vorgeschrieben werden,
welche Lebensform er gut zu finden hat. Nirgendwo gibt es heute noch
nennenswerte Diskriminierung Homosexueller und anderer sexueller Minderheiten –
und das ist auch gut so. Der grün-rote Kampf gegen die angeblich
allgegenwärtige Diskriminierung, der unter der Fahne des „Gender Mainstreaming“
geführt wird, hat die Zerstörung der traditionellen Familie und die Auflösung
der geschlechtlichen Identität von Mann und Frau zu seinem eigentlichen Ziel.</i></div><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Die
Politik des „Gender Mainstreaming“ mit all ihren Folgeerscheinungen wie
Frauenquoten,</i><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Gleichstellungsbeauftragten
und staatlicher Propaganda für sexuelle Minderheiten lehnt die AfD rigoros ab.</i>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Homosexuelle nicht diskriminiert? Bestes Beispiel ist die AfD doch
selbst -&gt; keine Ehe für alle und kein Adoptionsrecht für homosexuelle Paare?
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Homophobe sitzen zu Hauf bei der AfD! Sind nicht genügend AfD´ler
bei den Demos für Alle federführend dabei?</p>
<p>Ehe: </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Alle Paare, die den Bund fürs Leben schließen sollten, egal ob
hetero- oder homosexuell gleich behandelt werden und die gleichen Rechte haben.
68% der Deutschen stimmen dafür.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ehe heißt auch Fürsorge füreinander und damit bspw. im Pflegefall
finanzielle Entlastung für den Staat. Aufgrund dessen gewährt der Staat
Steuererleichterung wie bspw. Ehegattensplitting.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Und jeder, der eine Ehe führt, sollte das Adoptionsrecht erhalten,
egal ob hetero- oder homosexuell. Familie ist da, wo Liebe ist!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Oder glaubt die AfD wirklich, dass Kinder bspw. schwul werden weil
die Eltern schwul sind?</p>
<p><i>Kriminalstatistik
reformieren für eine effektivere Integration und Strafverfolgung. </i><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Die
AfD tritt dafür ein, dass die polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik eine
Differenzierung von Tatverdächtigen mit Migrationshintergrund zulässt.</i></p>
<p>Kriminalstatistik für Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund? Das ist
Propaganda.</p>
<p><i>Die Wiedereinsetzung der allgemeinen
Wehrpflicht für männliche Deutsche.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In dieser modernen Welt sollte jeder selbst entscheiden, ob er
Wehrdienst leisten möchte oder lieber bspw. Zivildienst.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Die
AfD fordert, die Familie in Schulbüchern positiv und realitätsnah darzustellen.
Schulbücher, welche die Familie relativieren 
und zugleich gesellschaftlich kaum relevante Konstellationen (LSBTTIQ)
überhöhen, sollen für den Gebrauch an öffentlichen Schulen nicht zugelassen
werden.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Jedes
Kind verdient vollständige Aufklärung und sollte so erzogen werden, dass es
keine Berührungsängste zu anderen Menschen mit anderer sexueller Orientierung
hat. Man wird nicht schwul, nur weil der beste Freund schwul ist.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Die
AfD wendet sich gegen Diskriminierung, auch die Diskriminierung von
LSBTTIQ-Menschen und eingetragenen Lebenspartnerschaften. Deren Gleichstellung
mit der Ehe lehnt die AfD jedoch ab, da nur die Ehe zwischen Mann und Frau eine
Familie begründen kann. Projekte und Lehrstühle an Hochschulen sollen helfen,
den Wert von Ehe und Familie darzustellen und nicht – wie im Falle von
Gender-Studies – genau das Gegenteil bewirken.</i></p>
<p>Irgendwie wiederspricht sich das? Das ist homophob.</p>
<p><i>Jungen
fördern</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Die
AfD fordert eine das Potenzial von Jungen wertschätzende Bildung und Erziehung.
Mädchen und Jungen sind gleichberechtigt zu behandeln und zu fördern. Jungen
sind schon seit vielen Jahren die großen Verlierer unserer Gesellschaft.
Kindergarten und </i><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Schule
sind auf Mädchen zugeschnitten, Jungen erfahren eine strukturelle
Benachteiligung. Dem ist entschlossen entgegenzuwirken. Zukünftige Familien
brauchen nicht nur starke Frauen, sondern auch starke Männer.</i></p>
<p>Liest sich wie zu Adolf´s Zeiten. </p>
<p><i>Chancengleichheit
wiederherstellen – Gleichstellungsbeauftragte und Frauenquoten abschaffen</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Die
an allen baden-württembergischen Universitäten und Hochschulen per Gesetz
installierten sogenannten Gleichstellungsbeauftragten sollen angeblich die
Chancengleichheit von Frauen und Männern garantieren. In Wahrheit führen sie –
im Verein mit dem Instrument der Frauenquote – regelmäßig zur Diskriminierung
von männlichen Stellenbewerbern. Die AfD fordert ihre ersatzlose Abschaffung.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">... so ein Schwachsinn. Wo sind denn die benachteiligten Männer?
Ahja... die wissen ja vor lauter Gender Mainstreaming gar nicht mehr was sie
sind. Deshalb auch Jungen fördern.</p>
<p>...und noch vieles mehr.</p>

<p><b>6. Persönlich Meinung </b></p>
<p><u>Politische Meinung:</u></p>
<p>Ich bin weder Rechts, Links noch Mitte. Ich bin der Meinung, dass
unsere Bundesregierung nicht nur mit positiven Taten in den letzten Jahren
geglänzt hat. Aber es wurde auch viel Gutes getan. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Auch ist die Flüchtlingskrise unter der derzeitigen Bundesregierung
als Außenstehender oftmals chaotisch und planlos wahrzunehmen. Aber wer kann
die Flüchtlingskrise zeitnah ohne Chaos lösen? Niemand! </p>
<p>Das ist für mich jedoch kein Grund der AfD meine Stimme zu geben.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Wie die Mehrheit der Deutschen teile ich die Meinung, dass man
sich in einer humanitären Flüchtlingskrise den Menschen gegenüber solidarisch zeigen
muss und ihnen helfen muss. </p>
<p>Ich kann nicht an einem weinenden Flüchtlingskind vorbei gehen!
Ihr? </p>
<p>Dort wo es Gutes gibt, gibt es auch Schlechtes. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Unter deutschen Staatsbürgern gibt es, genauso wie unter
Flüchtlingen, einen gewissen kleinen Prozentsatz an Kriminellen. Das braucht
man nicht verheimlichen und auch nicht schön reden. Ich selbst konnte bei
aktiver Hilfe vor Ort feststellen, dass die Mehrheit der Flüchtlinge nicht
kriminell ist und trotz allem Erlebten friedlich ist und bei uns Schutz vor
Krieg und Verfolgung sucht. </p>
<p><u>Angela Merkel:</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ein ganz kurzes Wort zu Angela Merkel, die auch meine Interessen
nicht immer so vertritt wie ich es mir wünsche, aber: Die Frau hat einen harten
Job, einen Job den alleine physisch und psychisch nur wenige über die Jahre so
aushalten könnten, denn der Job eines Bundeskanzlers hat sich massivst
gewandelt. Dennoch ziehe ich vor Ihr den Hut. </p>
<p><u>Was mich bewegt:</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Die AfD-Partei will „Familie stärken“. So schön das auch auf den
ersten Blick klingt, so homophob ist es auf den zweiten Blick. Ich bin schwul
und lebe seit 2010 in einer eingetragenen Lebenspartnerschaft. Eigentlich führen
wir eine Ehe wie jedes andere Hetero-Paar auch. Wir sind in guten wie in
schlechten Tagen füreinander da, halten uns die Hand an schlechten Tagen und heben
uns hoch an schönen Tagen. Was ist an uns anders als bei Mann und Frau? </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ein adoptiertes Kind hätte es bei uns besser als in einem
Kinderheim oder in einer Familie, wo es ungewollt ist. Und wir könnten einem
Kind die gleiche Liebe schenken, wie ein heterosexuelles Paar.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Egal ob hetero, schwul, lesbisch, transsexuell, jeder kann eine
gute Mutter oder ein guter Vater sein. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Oder glaubt die AfD-Partei, dass man schwul oder lesbisch wird,
weil die Eltern es sind?  Das würde zum
AfD-Wahlpunkt Gender-Mainstreaming passen. Kinder nicht über alle sexuellen
Orientierungen aufklären?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Deutschland ist ein Einwanderungsland und wir brauchen Zuwanderung.
Deutschland lebt von seiner kulturellen Vielfalt. Egal woher man kommt oder
egal was man ist, man ist kein besserer oder schlechterer Mensch. Freunde von
mir kommen aus Spanien, aus der Türkei usw. teilweise mit deutscher
Staatsbürgerschaft, teilweise ohne. Und? Vllt. kommen jetzt noch neue Freunde
aus Syrien dazu.</p>
<p><u>Migrationshintergrund?:</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Damit sind wir beim nächsten Punkt -&gt; Ich bin deutscher
Staatsbürger, oder halt Moment... ich habe zwar einen deutschen Pass aber meine
Großmutter kommt aus Ungarn... habe ich jetzt einen Migrationshintergrund?  Ist das dann nicht so? Oder verwäscht sich
das dann?</p>
<p><u>Homophobie:</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ein aktuelles Beispiel: Am 23.01.2016 gab es mal wieder eine  „Demo für alle“. Auch viele AfD Anhänger waren
dort und haben aktiv gesprochen. Muss so eine Demo sein? Was haben die Menschen
denn getan? Leben wir noch in Hitler-Zeiten, wo Homosexuelle und Behinderte
verfolgt wurden oder leben wir in einer modernen Gesellschaft die alle Formen
des Daseins, sofern es den anderen nicht schadet, akzeptiert?</p>
<p><u><b>TV-Duelle:</b></u></p>

<br/></div>","#noafdWir klären über das Wahlprogramm der AfD auf. Wir sind parteilos. Mag sein, dass unsere derzeitige Regierung nicht immer mit Leistung glänzt und durch Ihre Handlungen der AfD einen größeren Nährboden zur Verfügung stellt. Die Verlockung ist groß, die AfD aus Protest zu wählen – allerdings weichen die Botschaften der Wahlplakate teilweise massiv von den Inhalten der Landtagswahlprogramme ab. Wir klären über das Programm der AfD auf, um die Menschen zum Umdenken anzuregen. Viele Werte, die wir uns in den letzten Jahren erarbeitet haben, würden von der AfD vernichtet werden – das muss nicht sein! Unterstützt unsere Crowdfunding-Kampagne, damit wir noch mehr Menschen zum Umdenken anregen können. 

Es wird Zeit aufzuklären und aktiv eine
Kampagne gegen das rechtspopulistische Wahlprogramm der AfD-Partei zu
starten. Sei mit dabei und werde Teil unserer Kampagne! 

Unser Ziel:Eine rechtspopulistische Partei wie die AfD-Partei
darf kein Mitspracherecht in unserem Land erhalten!2.000.000 EUR hat die AfD für die eigene Partei gesammelt. Sammeln wir 2.000.000 EUR gegen das Wahlprogramm der AfD! Mit deiner Unterstützung klären wir auf!



Inhalt:

1. AfD - Wir müssen aufklären! 
2. Was ist unser Ziel? Was müssen wir erreichen?
2.1. Das passiert mit deiner Unterstützung.
2.2.  Was ist unser Ziel – was wollen wir erreichen?
3. Aufklärung: Wahlprogramm der AfD im Detail
4. Wie könnt Ihr uns unterstützen?
5. Wie könnt Ihr uns außerhalb des
Crowdfundings helfen?
6. Persönlich1. AfD – Wir
müssen aufklären!
Jeden Tag wird über die 
AfD-Partei berichtet und ich frage mich, ob die Befürworter der AfD eine
Ahnung davon haben was sie da wählen? Und ich frage mich, was unser Land
dagegen tut? Auszug aus dem Wahlprogramm:
Gender-Mainstreaming abschaffen, Euro abschaffen, EU-Austritt, Grenzen
schließen, Flüchtlinge abschieben, Ehen stabilisieren, ideologiefreie LGBT- freie Kindererziehung,
Jungen fördern,  Frauenquote abschaffen,
Ehe nur für Mann und Frau usw...Original-Aussagen aus der AfD:In Thüringen fordert die AfD die Zählung der Homosexuellen. Unsere Bundeskanzlerin mit der Zwangsjacke abführen. ""3000 Jahre Europa, 1000 Jahre Deutschland!"", ""Wir sind das Volk!"" und ""Blonde Frauen müssen in Deutschland Angst haben"", solche und noch viele weitere Aussagen kommen von der AfD.
Die AfD-Partei (Alternative für Deutschland) gewinnt an Zuwachs...
derzeit 10% und mehr. Weil kaum einer das Wahlprogramm im Detail kennt.
Und wenn wir in unserem Land dieser rechtspopulistischen Partei
kein Mitspracherecht geben wollen, müssen wir selbst aktiv werden und uns nicht
auf unsere Politiker verlassen. Die haben derzeit genügend andere Probleme.
Und wieso gewinnt die AfD Partei immer mehr Wähler? 
Weil die neuen Anhänger der AfD-Partei oftmals unwissende Protestwähler
sind! Unwissend, weil die nach außen getragenen Wahlslogans vom Wahlprogramm massiv
abweichen.  Auf den Plakaten steht zum
Beispiel nur „Familie stärken“, aber das LGBT feindliche Wahlprogramm dahinter
steht nicht dabei.
Mag sein, dass unsere derzeitige Regierung nicht immer eine
Glanzleistung hingelegt hat, auch nicht in der Flüchtlingskrise... aber mal
ehrlich: Welches Land bzw. welche dahinter stehende Regierung kann sich auf ein
solches Szenario vorbereiten? Kein Land und keine Regierung kann das.
Nehmen wir mal an die AfD wäre an der Macht? Würde es unserer
Nation damit besser gehen? Schauen wir doch mal aktuell in unser Nachbarland
nach Polen, dann wissen wir was uns blühen wird, wenn die AfD in Deutschland an
Zuwachs gewinnt. Wir müssen aufklären!
Natürlich bringt die Flüchtlingskrise auch Probleme mit sich. Aber
mit Motzen wird das auch nicht besser. Probleme muss man lösen und man löst
eine Flüchtlingskrise nicht mit rechtsradikaler Propaganda und schon garnicht mit
Grenzzäunen. Es geht immer noch um Menschenleben.
Wollen wir, dass die Alternative für Deutschland in Landtagen oder
im Bundesstag Mitspracherecht bekommt? Wollen wir noch mehr unaufgeklärte
Wähler an die AfD verlieren?
2. Was ist
unser Ziel? Was müssen wir erreichen?Wir müssen Protestwähler vermeiden. Müssen über das homophobe, frauenfeindliche, ausländerfeindliche, europafeindliche Wahlprogramm aufklären.

Wir wollen AfD-Protestwähler vermeiden! Wir sind parteilos aber
wir machen den Mund auf!
Wir klären über das rechtspopulistische Wahlprogramm der AfD-Partei
auf. Online und auf der Straße. Wir wollen Deutschland aufzeigen, was im Detail
hinter der AfD-Partei steckt. 
Protest gegen die AfD-Partei begegnet man derzeit hauptsächlich
nur online im Social-Media Bereich. Auf der Straße sieht man zwar Gegendemos,
aber reicht das aus? 
Das müssen wir dringend ändern! Derzeitige Online-Diskussionen bspw.
auf Facebook sind zwar hilfreich, erreicht aber viele Menschen in unserem Land
nicht.  Nicht weil die Menschen kein
Internet haben, sondern weil nicht alle Menschen an Online Diskussionen
teilnehmen wollen.
Machen wir den Mund auf! #noafd

2.1. Das passiert mit deiner
Unterstützung.
Vorab: Der Rahmen unserer Möglichkeiten ist abhängig von der
tatsächlich am Ende zustande gekommenen Crowdfunding- Summe. Je mehr zusammen
kommt, desto mehr ist möglich. Die AfD-Partei hat nach neuesten Angaben 2.000.000
Euro für Ihr Wahlprogramm gesammelt. Da müssen wir dagegen halten, daher haben wir, auch wenn wir es vllt. nicht erreichen werden, die gleiche Summe als Ziel angegeben. 
Mach mit, wenn du nicht willst, dass eine rechtspopulistische
Partei unser Land mitregiert.

Gegenwerbung:
Überall dort wo die AfD-Partei Werbung macht, platzieren wir
Gegenwerbung in Form von Plakaten und Aufstellern. Diese Werbung soll Menschen
zum Umdenken bewegen, im Kopf bleiben und darf auch belustigen. Keine
Straßenzüge mehr nur mit alleiniger AfD- Wahlkampfwerbung! 
Die AfD-Partei darf kein Mitspracherecht in
unserem Land erhalten.

Demonstrationen:
Die AfD-Partei ruft ihre Anhänger zu Demonstrationen auf.
Gewalttätig gehen die AfD Anhänger gegen die Presse vor und demonstriert auf
Straßen. Redner versuchen mit rechtspopulistischen Äußerungen und Propaganda
Menschen in Ihren Bann zu ziehen. 
Wir müssen dagegen halten, aufklären und dagegen demonstrieren.  Wir organisieren und mobilisieren zu Gegendemos
und bewerben diese aktiv. 
Aufklärungsarbeit in den Fußgängerzonen:
Zusammen mit Helfern werden wir in den Fußgängerzonen aktiv
Gegenwerbung machen.  Ziehen Stände auf
und klären über das Wahlprogramm der AfD auf. Die Wähler müssen aufgeklärt werden.
Wurfsendungen:
Und am wichtigsten ist, wir machen den Inhalt der
Landtagswahlprogramme für alle öffentlich, so zusammengefasst, dass alle es
verstehen und bereit sind 64 Seiten (Beispiel Baden-Württemberg) gekürzt und
ungeschönt auf wenige Seiten zu lesen. Das muss jeder Haushalt per Wurfsendung
erhalten. 
Immer das Ziel vor Augen -> Die AfD Partei
darf kein Mitspracherecht in unserem Land erhalten.
3. Aufklärung: Wahlprogramm der AfD im DetailIch behaupte, dass nur ein Bruchteil der AfD-Wähler die
Landtagswahlprogramme im Detail gelesen hat. Ich habe mir das 64-Seitige
Landtagswahlprogramm in Baden-Württemberg und die andere Wahlprogramme der AfD durchgelesen
und bin schockiert. Willkommen in der Steinzeit.
Selbst ehemalige AfD Mitglieder wie bspw. Hans-Olaf Henkel sagen
mittlerweile: 
„Anständige können die AfD nicht mehr wählen.“ 
„Die AfD hat einen extrem hohen Anteil von gescheiterten
Existenzen.“
Auszüge aus dem Landtagswahlprogramm (Beispiel Baden-Württemberg):
- Gender-Mainstreaming abschaffen
- Euro abschaffen 
- Grenzen schließen 
- Ehen stabilisieren
- ideologiefreie LGBT-freie Erziehung
- Jungen fördern 
- Frauenquote abschaffen 
- Ehe nur für Mann und Frau 
usw.
Ich fasse hier nur Auszüge zusammen, AfD Originaltexte in kursiv:
Die
AfD beharrt darauf, dass es das Recht und die Aufgabe eines souveränen Staates
ist, selbst zu bestimmen, wer seine Grenzen überschreitet und wer sich
dauerhaft auf seinem Territorium aufhalten darf. Diesem Recht mit umfassenden
Grenzkontrollen und notfalls auch mit Grenzzäunen Geltung zu verschaffen, ist
ein elementares Gebot staatspolitischer Vernunft und Verantwortung.
-> Grenzzäune? Nein Danke!
Jeder
soll nach seiner Façon selig werden, aber niemandem darf vorgeschrieben werden,
welche Lebensform er gut zu finden hat. Nirgendwo gibt es heute noch
nennenswerte Diskriminierung Homosexueller und anderer sexueller Minderheiten –
und das ist auch gut so. Der grün-rote Kampf gegen die angeblich
allgegenwärtige Diskriminierung, der unter der Fahne des „Gender Mainstreaming“
geführt wird, hat die Zerstörung der traditionellen Familie und die Auflösung
der geschlechtlichen Identität von Mann und Frau zu seinem eigentlichen Ziel.Die
Politik des „Gender Mainstreaming“ mit all ihren Folgeerscheinungen wie
Frauenquoten,Gleichstellungsbeauftragten
und staatlicher Propaganda für sexuelle Minderheiten lehnt die AfD rigoros ab.
Homosexuelle nicht diskriminiert? Bestes Beispiel ist die AfD doch
selbst -> keine Ehe für alle und kein Adoptionsrecht für homosexuelle Paare?

Homophobe sitzen zu Hauf bei der AfD! Sind nicht genügend AfD´ler
bei den Demos für Alle federführend dabei?
Ehe: 
Alle Paare, die den Bund fürs Leben schließen sollten, egal ob
hetero- oder homosexuell gleich behandelt werden und die gleichen Rechte haben.
68% der Deutschen stimmen dafür.
Ehe heißt auch Fürsorge füreinander und damit bspw. im Pflegefall
finanzielle Entlastung für den Staat. Aufgrund dessen gewährt der Staat
Steuererleichterung wie bspw. Ehegattensplitting.
Und jeder, der eine Ehe führt, sollte das Adoptionsrecht erhalten,
egal ob hetero- oder homosexuell. Familie ist da, wo Liebe ist!
Oder glaubt die AfD wirklich, dass Kinder bspw. schwul werden weil
die Eltern schwul sind?
Kriminalstatistik
reformieren für eine effektivere Integration und Strafverfolgung. Die
AfD tritt dafür ein, dass die polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik eine
Differenzierung von Tatverdächtigen mit Migrationshintergrund zulässt.
Kriminalstatistik für Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund? Das ist
Propaganda.
Die Wiedereinsetzung der allgemeinen
Wehrpflicht für männliche Deutsche.
In dieser modernen Welt sollte jeder selbst entscheiden, ob er
Wehrdienst leisten möchte oder lieber bspw. Zivildienst.
Die
AfD fordert, die Familie in Schulbüchern positiv und realitätsnah darzustellen.
Schulbücher, welche die Familie relativieren 
und zugleich gesellschaftlich kaum relevante Konstellationen (LSBTTIQ)
überhöhen, sollen für den Gebrauch an öffentlichen Schulen nicht zugelassen
werden.
Jedes
Kind verdient vollständige Aufklärung und sollte so erzogen werden, dass es
keine Berührungsängste zu anderen Menschen mit anderer sexueller Orientierung
hat. Man wird nicht schwul, nur weil der beste Freund schwul ist.
Die
AfD wendet sich gegen Diskriminierung, auch die Diskriminierung von
LSBTTIQ-Menschen und eingetragenen Lebenspartnerschaften. Deren Gleichstellung
mit der Ehe lehnt die AfD jedoch ab, da nur die Ehe zwischen Mann und Frau eine
Familie begründen kann. Projekte und Lehrstühle an Hochschulen sollen helfen,
den Wert von Ehe und Familie darzustellen und nicht – wie im Falle von
Gender-Studies – genau das Gegenteil bewirken.
Irgendwie wiederspricht sich das? Das ist homophob.
Jungen
fördern
Die
AfD fordert eine das Potenzial von Jungen wertschätzende Bildung und Erziehung.
Mädchen und Jungen sind gleichberechtigt zu behandeln und zu fördern. Jungen
sind schon seit vielen Jahren die großen Verlierer unserer Gesellschaft.
Kindergarten und Schule
sind auf Mädchen zugeschnitten, Jungen erfahren eine strukturelle
Benachteiligung. Dem ist entschlossen entgegenzuwirken. Zukünftige Familien
brauchen nicht nur starke Frauen, sondern auch starke Männer.
Liest sich wie zu Adolf´s Zeiten. 
Chancengleichheit
wiederherstellen – Gleichstellungsbeauftragte und Frauenquoten abschaffen
Die
an allen baden-württembergischen Universitäten und Hochschulen per Gesetz
installierten sogenannten Gleichstellungsbeauftragten sollen angeblich die
Chancengleichheit von Frauen und Männern garantieren. In Wahrheit führen sie –
im Verein mit dem Instrument der Frauenquote – regelmäßig zur Diskriminierung
von männlichen Stellenbewerbern. Die AfD fordert ihre ersatzlose Abschaffung.
... so ein Schwachsinn. Wo sind denn die benachteiligten Männer?
Ahja... die wissen ja vor lauter Gender Mainstreaming gar nicht mehr was sie
sind. Deshalb auch Jungen fördern.
...und noch vieles mehr.

6. Persönlich Meinung 
Politische Meinung:
Ich bin weder Rechts, Links noch Mitte. Ich bin der Meinung, dass
unsere Bundesregierung nicht nur mit positiven Taten in den letzten Jahren
geglänzt hat. Aber es wurde auch viel Gutes getan. 
Auch ist die Flüchtlingskrise unter der derzeitigen Bundesregierung
als Außenstehender oftmals chaotisch und planlos wahrzunehmen. Aber wer kann
die Flüchtlingskrise zeitnah ohne Chaos lösen? Niemand! 
Das ist für mich jedoch kein Grund der AfD meine Stimme zu geben.
Wie die Mehrheit der Deutschen teile ich die Meinung, dass man
sich in einer humanitären Flüchtlingskrise den Menschen gegenüber solidarisch zeigen
muss und ihnen helfen muss. 
Ich kann nicht an einem weinenden Flüchtlingskind vorbei gehen!
Ihr? 
Dort wo es Gutes gibt, gibt es auch Schlechtes. 
Unter deutschen Staatsbürgern gibt es, genauso wie unter
Flüchtlingen, einen gewissen kleinen Prozentsatz an Kriminellen. Das braucht
man nicht verheimlichen und auch nicht schön reden. Ich selbst konnte bei
aktiver Hilfe vor Ort feststellen, dass die Mehrheit der Flüchtlinge nicht
kriminell ist und trotz allem Erlebten friedlich ist und bei uns Schutz vor
Krieg und Verfolgung sucht. 
Angela Merkel:
Ein ganz kurzes Wort zu Angela Merkel, die auch meine Interessen
nicht immer so vertritt wie ich es mir wünsche, aber: Die Frau hat einen harten
Job, einen Job den alleine physisch und psychisch nur wenige über die Jahre so
aushalten könnten, denn der Job eines Bundeskanzlers hat sich massivst
gewandelt. Dennoch ziehe ich vor Ihr den Hut. 
Was mich bewegt:
Die AfD-Partei will „Familie stärken“. So schön das auch auf den
ersten Blick klingt, so homophob ist es auf den zweiten Blick. Ich bin schwul
und lebe seit 2010 in einer eingetragenen Lebenspartnerschaft. Eigentlich führen
wir eine Ehe wie jedes andere Hetero-Paar auch. Wir sind in guten wie in
schlechten Tagen füreinander da, halten uns die Hand an schlechten Tagen und heben
uns hoch an schönen Tagen. Was ist an uns anders als bei Mann und Frau? 
Ein adoptiertes Kind hätte es bei uns besser als in einem
Kinderheim oder in einer Familie, wo es ungewollt ist. Und wir könnten einem
Kind die gleiche Liebe schenken, wie ein heterosexuelles Paar.
Egal ob hetero, schwul, lesbisch, transsexuell, jeder kann eine
gute Mutter oder ein guter Vater sein. 
Oder glaubt die AfD-Partei, dass man schwul oder lesbisch wird,
weil die Eltern es sind?  Das würde zum
AfD-Wahlpunkt Gender-Mainstreaming passen. Kinder nicht über alle sexuellen
Orientierungen aufklären?
Deutschland ist ein Einwanderungsland und wir brauchen Zuwanderung.
Deutschland lebt von seiner kulturellen Vielfalt. Egal woher man kommt oder
egal was man ist, man ist kein besserer oder schlechterer Mensch. Freunde von
mir kommen aus Spanien, aus der Türkei usw. teilweise mit deutscher
Staatsbürgerschaft, teilweise ohne. Und? Vllt. kommen jetzt noch neue Freunde
aus Syrien dazu.
Migrationshintergrund?:
Damit sind wir beim nächsten Punkt -> Ich bin deutscher
Staatsbürger, oder halt Moment... ich habe zwar einen deutschen Pass aber meine
Großmutter kommt aus Ungarn... habe ich jetzt einen Migrationshintergrund?  Ist das dann nicht so? Oder verwäscht sich
das dann?
Homophobie:
Ein aktuelles Beispiel: Am 23.01.2016 gab es mal wieder eine  „Demo für alle“. Auch viele AfD Anhänger waren
dort und haben aktiv gesprochen. Muss so eine Demo sein? Was haben die Menschen
denn getan? Leben wir noch in Hitler-Zeiten, wo Homosexuelle und Behinderte
verfolgt wurden oder leben wir in einer modernen Gesellschaft die alle Formen
des Daseins, sofern es den anderen nicht schadet, akzeptiert?
TV-Duelle:
Politik heißt auch sich unbequeme Diskussionen zu stellen und sein
Volk, dass einen gewählt hat, dort zu vertreten.  Wenn einen das Fernsehen zum TV-Duell einlädt,
hat man da ohne Wenn und Aber hinzugehen und nicht von oben herab Debatte
darüber zu führen, mit wem man diskutieren möchte. So funktioniert es leider
auch nicht. Also habt Mut und stellt euch in den TV Debatten. 
Euch kann nichts Besseres passieren, als sachlicher TV-Wahlkampf
gegen die AfD. 
AfD bedeutet für Deutschland und Europa Rückschritt -> Willkommen
in der Steinzeit.
Die AfD Partei darf kein Mitspracherecht in
unserem Land erhalten.

<li>We use Sugar Kelp (Saccharina latissima) (don't let the name freak you out - it has just 0.6g of natural plant sugars per 100g). It's also known as Sweet Kelp, Kombu Royale, Sea Belt, and Poor Man's Weather Glass. It's a delicate, delicious, and edible brown macroalgae. </li>
<li>Kelp is full of vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, amino acids, omega-3 fats and fiber, including zinc, magnesium, iron, potassium, copper, and calcium (<i>10x more than milk!</i>). </li>
<li>Kelp supports your body’s ability to absorb water and is a rich, natural source of iodine that helps to stimulate a healthy metabolism. </li>
<li>Kelp is also one of the only foods that expands in your stomach, making you feel fuller, longer. </li>

We never wild-harvest kelp, which is detrimental to our ocean's ecosystems. Our kelp is sourced from our network of New England ocean farms, which function as storm-surge protectors and shoreline ecosystems for 150+ species. <i>And did you know that seaweed soaks up 5x more carbon from the water than land based plants do from the air?</i></p><p><b>The benefits of kelp for both the human body as well as the long-term health of the planet are incredible. It is truly a food for a better future.</b></p><h1>Help us Grow</h1><p>We're a small, lean team on a big mission, which is why we're raising $25,000 in funds on Kickstarter today. </p><ul>
<li>The funds will help support our first fully scaled production run so we can move out of our little East Village kitchen. </li>
<li>They will also go towards the purchase of recyclable packaging for our Kelp Jerky (which costs twice as much as regular packaging!)</li>
<li>And the funds will support <a href=""http://akua.co"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">our online shop</a> so we can sell internationally to you from day one!</li>
<li>
<b>Stretch goals:</b> If we can go past $25,000 in funding, this means we can expedite our launch this summer, sell in more stores across the country from day one, and support more farmers in the New England area to grow more Kelp for more Kelp Jerky! </li>

By backing us on IndieGogo InDemand, you're helping us bring this ancient, magical seagreen to the world this year. 
 
Introducing Kelp Jerky - Your New Favorite Snack
Ever found yourself looking for a high-protein snack? One without loads of sugar? And one that's plant-based? It's not easy! But we've got you!Richard Branson approved. After a year of R&D, we’re ready to launch our first product, Kelp Jerky to the world - a delicious, savory, vegan jerky in 3 flavors made with kelp, mushrooms, and superfoods - the only high-protein, high-fiber, plant-based snack on the market that’s free from refined sugar, soy, and gluten. Our Kelp Jerky is packed with outrageously delicious flavors like our sea salt & sesame with hints of nori, our ""High Thai'd"" with turmeric and coconut, and our rosemary BBQ with a touch of maple, all layered on top of hints of umami mushroom and mineral-rich sugar kelp. Want to create your own flavor of Kelp Jerky? We've got a reward tier for that! We're super excited about creating new flavors with you!Sea Salt & Sesame Turmeric Thai & Coconut Rosemary Maple & BBQ
 Put down the soy sticks and skip the protein bars with 10g of sugar. We've got you covered. Whether you're gearing up for a triathlon or just getting hangry on a road trip, with 8g of protein and less than 1g of made-in-the-USA organic maple tree sugar, Kelp Jerky, is going to be your new favorite snack. To date, we've received rave reviews! Kelp Jerky in the Media
 We're using only recyclable packaging + hitting the shelves this year!  Kelp for Your Health 
We use Sugar Kelp (Saccharina latissima) (don't let the name freak you out - it has just 0.6g of natural plant sugars per 100g). It's also known as Sweet Kelp, Kombu Royale, Sea Belt, and Poor Man's Weather Glass. It's a delicate, delicious, and edible brown macroalgae. 
Kelp is full of vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, amino acids, omega-3 fats and fiber, including zinc, magnesium, iron, potassium, copper, and calcium (10x more than milk!). 
Kelp supports your body’s ability to absorb water and is a rich, natural source of iodine that helps to stimulate a healthy metabolism. 
Kelp is also one of the only foods that expands in your stomach, making you feel fuller, longer. 
A Nutritious Blade of Sugar KelpKelp for the Planet's HealthWe use ocean-farmed kelp, which is a zero-input crop, which requires no fresh water, fertilizer, or dry land on which to grow. We never wild-harvest kelp, which is detrimental to our ocean's ecosystems. Our kelp is sourced from our network of New England ocean farms, which function as storm-surge protectors and shoreline ecosystems for 150+ species. And did you know that seaweed soaks up 5x more carbon from the water than land based plants do from the air?The benefits of kelp for both the human body as well as the long-term health of the planet are incredible. It is truly a food for a better future.Help us GrowWe're a small, lean team on a big mission, which is why we're raising $25,000 in funds on Kickstarter today. 
The funds will help support our first fully scaled production run so we can move out of our little East Village kitchen. 
They will also go towards the purchase of recyclable packaging for our Kelp Jerky (which costs twice as much as regular packaging!)
And the funds will support our online shop so we can sell internationally to you from day one!

Stretch goals: If we can go past $25,000 in funding, this means we can expedite our launch this summer, sell in more stores across the country from day one, and support more farmers in the New England area to grow more Kelp for more Kelp Jerky! 
Today, the global plant-based meat market is projected to reach $5.2 billion by 2020. Projections include seaweeds accounting for at least 15% of that -- $750 million in the next 2 years. We want to go bigger but we need your help!Beyond Kelp Jerky, our future products will include kelp burgers, kelp sausages, kelp broth, kelp noodles, kelp dressings, and more. We want to grow AKUA into a household name for seagreens based products for decades to come. CBM, Co-Founder, CO-CEO/CMO We hope you'll join our community of supporters as we explore the boundless potential of the ocean’s seagreens that lie just beyond every shoreline in the world.It’s not always easy making the world a better place. But with your help and our kelp… we can do it together! #kelpjerkyiscoming! Your Rewards!We will be thanking you via email and publicly but we also want you to have awesome rewards! So we are shipping you bags and bags of our brand new Kelp Jerky along with cool AKUA and artist-created swag. Check out the list below for a full rundown of our reward tiers!

<p></p>The Sweet Tooth is a specialty bakery known for our delicious variety of gourmet cupcakes serving the entire KC metro for catering and a store in Blue Springs. Our mission is to promote happiness by providing customers with the ideal dessert in individual serving sizes. Baking is our passion and our great line of products and extensively researched business plan positioned us to grow and promote happiness in our community for many years to come! We offer an amazing lineup of cupcakes, cookies, cake pops and cheesecakes from our store in Blue Springs and we think it's time we spread our sweet happiness all across the Kansas City Metro. We have built an active Facebook fanbase and keep them engaged with frequent and interesting posts. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sweettoothkc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click Here</a>, to become our fan on Facebook.  We are growing our business and we recently purchased <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/3girlscupcakes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3 Girls Cupcakes</a>, a mobile cupcakery!  <p></p>

<h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/172692/files/20131103092537-image.jpeg?1383499537"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We always wanted a cupcake truck, and now we have one.  The problem, our cupcake truck says 3 Girls Cupcakes and has outdated contact information.  This leads to a lot of confusion, our customers are looking for The Sweet Tooth and they see 3 Girls Cupcakes.  We need to end the confusion so our customers know it's actually us!  We are looking to replace the old information with brand new accurate information!  Will you help us?  We are accepting any level of support, no amount is too small.  <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/172689/files/20131103091859-MockUp-Driver.jpg?1383499139"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We also have stretch goals set up depending on how much support our campaign receives.  We need to update both websites to reflect complete and accurate information.  When staff is out on The Cupcake Cruiser, they also have to deal with the elements.  Kansas City has hot Summers and cold Winters.  There is no AC or heat in the back of The Cruiser and it can get a little uncomfortable back there.  If we stretch far enough past our goal, we will get a permanent system installed in the back of The Cupcake Cruiser.  </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We run our business in a way that allows our staff and customers to feel a close connection to us, and even involved when coming up with new flavors.  The perks that we have set up with our campaign support that as well.  We are giving our supporters the opportunity to take over our creative process and really leave a lasting impression.  Our perks include, of course free cupcakes, but also unique opportunities like a VIP Pass to skip the line at The Cupcake Cruiser and a chance to create your own cupcake flavor and name!  We have a bit more information about some of our perks below, check them out and help us out if you can!  </p>
<h3>News and Recognition</h3>
<p>The Sweet Tooth has been recognized for many accomplishments even though we have only been open for a short amount of time.  In March 2011, only 6 months after we started taking orders, we entered and won the cupcake contest at the Love in Bloom Bridal Show at Powell Gardens.  We had an article on the front page of <a href=""http://www.examiner.net/news/x2011269655/Business-profile-The-Sweet-Tooth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Independence Examiner</a> and a follow up article later in the year.  We appreciate the support we receive from our community and give back whenever we can.  We have worked with Marian Hope, Alex’s Lemonade Stand, Grow Blue Springs and many other non-profit organizations.   We have been on several local news shows and we also competed on the hit Food Network TV show Cupcake Wars!<br/></p>

Baking is our passion and our great line of products and extensively researched business plan positioned us to grow and promote happiness in our community for many years to come! We offer an amazing lineup of cupcakes, cookies, cake pops and cheesecakes from our store in Blue Springs and we think it's time we spread our sweet happiness all across the Kansas City Metro. We have built an active Facebook fanbase and keep them engaged with frequent and interesting posts. Click Here, to become our fan on Facebook.  We are growing our business and we recently purchased 3 Girls Cupcakes, a mobile cupcakery!  


What We Need


We always wanted a cupcake truck, and now we have one.  The problem, our cupcake truck says 3 Girls Cupcakes and has outdated contact information.  This leads to a lot of confusion, our customers are looking for The Sweet Tooth and they see 3 Girls Cupcakes.  We need to end the confusion so our customers know it's actually us!  We are looking to replace the old information with brand new accurate information!  Will you help us?  We are accepting any level of support, no amount is too small.  

We also have stretch goals set up depending on how much support our campaign receives.  We need to update both websites to reflect complete and accurate information.  When staff is out on The Cupcake Cruiser, they also have to deal with the elements.  Kansas City has hot Summers and cold Winters.  There is no AC or heat in the back of The Cruiser and it can get a little uncomfortable back there.  If we stretch far enough past our goal, we will get a permanent system installed in the back of The Cupcake Cruiser.  

What You Get

We run our business in a way that allows our staff and customers to feel a close connection to us, and even involved when coming up with new flavors.  The perks that we have set up with our campaign support that as well.  We are giving our supporters the opportunity to take over our creative process and really leave a lasting impression.  Our perks include, of course free cupcakes, but also unique opportunities like a VIP Pass to skip the line at The Cupcake Cruiser and a chance to create your own cupcake flavor and name!  We have a bit more information about some of our perks below, check them out and help us out if you can!  
News and Recognition
The Sweet Tooth has been recognized for many accomplishments even though we have only been open for a short amount of time.  In March 2011, only 6 months after we started taking orders, we entered and won the cupcake contest at the Love in Bloom Bridal Show at Powell Gardens.  We had an article on the front page of The Independence Examiner and a follow up article later in the year.  We appreciate the support we receive from our community and give back whenever we can.  We have worked with Marian Hope, Alex’s Lemonade Stand, Grow Blue Springs and many other non-profit organizations.   We have been on several local news shows and we also competed on the hit Food Network TV show Cupcake Wars!



Cupcakes in Space 
Who sends a cupcake to the edge of space?  The Sweet Tooth... that's who!  We have a picture below of one of our Rouge (Red Velvet) Cupcakes floating above the clouds! 



The Perks - Details 
We are excited about the perks we are offering with this campaign, and we wanted to provide a bit more details about some of them. Please keep in mind, we will have final approval on names to make sure they are appropriate.  
Level 2 - Only $20We will have a space reserved on The Cupcake Cruiser, next to the service window, for our Hall of Fame.  For this level of support, we will add your name to our wall of fame! Look for your name on our hall of fame each time you visit!  

Level 3 #TeamCupcake #YOLO At this level you will get one of our popular T-Shirts!
Level 5 Have you been to The Cupcake Cruiser and had to wait in a long line to get your cupcakes?  Standing in line for up to an hour will have you frustrated and hungry (but the cupcakes are worth the wait). Skip the line with our VIP Experience!  We will issue you a VIP Pass, with your picture on it, that will allow you to skip to the front of the line for a full year.  After you get your goodies with no wait, you can brag to everyone else in line that you are ""kind of a big deal!"" 
Level 6You can use this level to put a badge with your company's name and logo on the back of The Cupcake Cruiser.  It's great to have your company associated with our customers while they are having an amazing experience.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi there, we are Steve Ronalds and Sallie Jones (not married, just friends in case you were wondering), and we are the co-founders of Gippsland Jersey … a small milk brand that was formed out of personal adversity and the milk crisis in 2016. We are so proud of what we have been able to achieve in such a short time – producing milk you love while giving back to the community and shining a light on the mental health of farmers. Thanks to all of you who have supported us along the way and bought our milk.</p>
<p>We got a phone call from our milk processor telling us that we had four weeks until they would stop processing our milk. We’ve had to solve this problem really fast, as that decision could close our business.</p>
<p>Since that conversation we have made hundreds of phone calls to try and find an answer. We’ve found a temporary solution to keep our milk on the shelf … but we’re still left with a serious problem.</p>
<p>Having our own processing facility has always been part of the ‘Gippsland Jersey’ dream, as with our own facility we could control the whole process from the milking shed to the store shelf. If we can do this, we can ensure that our farmers are getting a fair price for their milk.</p>
<p>Sal's dad built a  factory in the 1980’s and was the first person in Australia to build a milk factory next to his dairy and to process milk and make ice cream on his own farm. Tragically Mike (Sallie's Dad) took his own life two years ago and left behind an incredible gift. Sometimes answers to life's problems are right under our noses  ... a factory, located on the organic dairy farm, with a rich history of home grown manufacturing and only five minutes from the township of Lakes Entrance is right the key to solving our processing crisis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we’re going to do is setup our very own milk processing plant, right here in the factory at Lakes Entrance. We’re going to transport Steve's beautiful Jersey milk from Jindivick and process  in Lakes Entrance. This is the perfect solution for us right now, as it means that we can be operational in three months time and our temporary solution will hold us over until then. With this plan we have one big problem though… we need to pay for it. To make this happen we need to buy and install a processing plant into this factory. We estimate that this is going to cost about $250,000 … and that’s where we need you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re launching a ‘Crowd Fund’ campaign to raise $100,000 towards getting this factory operational. Achieving this will help Gippsland Jersey in its dream to grow by bringing more farmers into our brand … and most importantly to pay them a fair price for their milk. </p>
<p>We know that this brand is people powered thanks to people like you … who choose to buy Gippsland Jersey milk and believe in us.</p>

<p>How many of these milk bottles would you be willing to ‘pre-purchase’ in contributing to our crowd fund? If you hold on to a copy of your receipt you can claim your milk and/or milkshakes at the new milk factory or at the Warragul Farmers Market</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't buy a bottle of milk, no worries. We get that sometimes it just isn't possible.

<h2><a href=""http://www.champagnesupplyco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Champagne Supply Company</i></a></h2>
<p><i>We offer a unique champagne bartending service for your wedding, bachelorette party, backyard brunch and holiday gatherings. Our champagne bar truck will be a hit at your event and your guest will leave with a lasting memory. Customized to your style, our bartenders are not just any bartenders, our champagne attendants will take care of every detail... from your champagne toast, to a night cap send off.</i></p>
<p>When we started Champagne Supply Company, we wanted to defeat two different stereotypes:</p>
<p>1. Women can’t work together</p>
<p>2. Family should never go into business</p>
<p><i>So far we have succeeded in both AND we’re growing! </i></p>

<p>The inspiration behind this business is based off a small food vending truck from Italy. We searched high and low for this truck in the United States and then exhausted the possibilities of importing. There was not a single option available in our world of domestic google searches and the foreign options seemed too complicated and risky for our young business. </p>
<p>We found the Cushman and jumped in! This is the American version of our Italian dream - she is perfect. Champagne Supply has been received with the warmest of welcoming arms into the Austin wedding community as well as nation wide. </p>
<p>But we didn’t stop there and our google searches haven't stopped. There isn't a rhyme or reason why this most recent google search came up with a new, relevant and available truck option BUT there she was! The Vintage Lambertta! Fully renovated, ready serve and deliver champagne to our Austin market!  </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Through our current business operations, we have the funds to cover half the cost of the new truck and we are looking to you to support us in raising the rest of the funds to bring this truck back to Texas from California! </p>
<p>We need $10,000 to meet the difference of full purchase price of the truck, shipping, title, first year’s insurance  as well as outfitting the bed of the truck to serve as your favorite champagne bar. </p>
<p>* Total Truck Price $15,000</p>
<p>* Estimated Shipping Cost $1,500</p>
<p>* Estimated Texas Taxes and Title $75.00</p>
<p>* Estimated Vehicle Insurance $1,200</p>
<p>* Estimated Bar Outfit $1,000</p>

<p>To successfully purchase this truck, our goal is to be fully funded by April 14, 2018! </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We set out to start a company that brought us together as friends, sisters and to set an example for other women to follow their dreams and support each other. </p>
<p>Ana has a background in retail business management, event production, client relations and company budgets. Her professional advancements have afforded her the learning to run a start up company with a profitable margin as well as the connections to strategically place Champagne Supply Co. in front of the area's event influencers. Experience in event planning, she has managed event budgets for clients up to $200,000 per event, planned multiple events at the same time and managed client communications and business development.</p>
<p>Gabrielle has achieved a successful career in corporate sales. She has been ranked in the top 5 (place 3 and 4th) sales executive for 3 years in a row.  Her training in this sales position brings proven tactics to Champagne Supply for optimal growth in numbers. Bringing to the team the ability to see the “40,000 Foot View,” she sees the big picture and how current decision might effect the future of the company. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522353184/ff9za5zy6lglt8ha24ie.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have big plans and they don't stop with two trucks. Our long term plan is to franchise into 3 different markets by 2020. This is just the beginning.</p>
<p><i><strong>What if we don't reach our funding goal?</strong></i></p>
<p>If we do not reach our full funding goal, we will use the amount raised towards:</p>
<p>* Full Branding Design - Hire a professional graphic designer to design our full company branding.</p>
<p>* Expand our glassware rental collection.</p>
<p>* Make updates and improvements to our current truck.</p>
<p>* Financially reimburse our parents for their time spent helping set up early morning events. </p>
<p>* We will even still have a champagne toast to celebrate all the support shown through this campaign!</p>
<p>* For any brides who contributed through the Bride To-Be options, don't worry, your champagne dreams can still come true and we will apply your contribution to the booking of our existing Cushman.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Risk Mitigating Factors</h2>
<p>Risk 1: Another company taking on the idea.. </p>
<p>Once the truck is ordered and delivered to the US we will be able to start talking about business to planners and brides with mock ups visuals. Until we have ordered the truck there is a higher chance the idea will be adopted by another company in the United States. Our goal is to be ahead of the market.</p>
<p>Risk 2: Connecting with Venues and Clients</p>
<p>Marketing will need to start taking place before the truck arrives to create awareness. This means staying active on Instagram, attending event networking events and keeping our marketing personal and targeted. </p>
<p>Risk 3: Liquor Licensing and TABC Laws</p>
<p>Navigating the laws around serving liquor at Texas events is challenging. The risk is misunderstanding the laws and getting fined which would set us back financially us back in the payout schedule. We will combat this risk by taking small licensing steps and partnering with catering companies who have been in the service business for 3+ years as consultants. </p>
<p>Risk 4: Booking through Wedding Season</p>
<p>To successfully book the truck through out wedding season, we will need to attend venue’s open houses and partner in our markets to show off the truck in order to be booked through Wedding Season. In order to stay ahead of each wedding cycle, we will need to fine tune our marketing plan to target each season of bride when they are booking their services. For Example, Spring 2019 brings will start booking vendors in Fall 2018. </p>

There isn't a rhyme or reason why this most recent google search came up with a new, relevant and available truck option BUT there she was! The Vintage Lambertta! Fully renovated, ready serve and deliver champagne to our Austin market!  


What We Need 
Through our current business operations, we have the funds to cover half the cost of the new truck and we are looking to you to support us in raising the rest of the funds to bring this truck back to Texas from California! 
We need $10,000 to meet the difference of full purchase price of the truck, shipping, title, first year’s insurance  as well as outfitting the bed of the truck to serve as your favorite champagne bar. 
* Total Truck Price $15,000
* Estimated Shipping Cost $1,500
* Estimated Texas Taxes and Title $75.00
* Estimated Vehicle Insurance $1,200
* Estimated Bar Outfit $1,000

To successfully purchase this truck, our goal is to be fully funded by April 14, 2018! 
What You Get
We are located in Austin, Texas and our main market (so far) has been wedding planners and Texas brides. So, we have curated a bridal package that will directly contribute to an event as well options that have some great rewards attached! 

 Austin Bride To-Be Package:  
$100 contribution  = $150 off your event booking * and Champagne Campaign Hat
$200 contribution = $300 off your event booking*, Champagne Campaign Hat and ONE invitation to our Funding Celebration*
$400 contribution = $550 off your event booking*, Champagne Campaign Hat and TWO Invitations to our Funding Celebration*
(* We want to be sure and reserve your event date as soon as you contribute. So, expect an email shortly after your contribution to ensure your date is secure to cash in your reward! Event dates available starting July 2019. ) 
Not getting married and still want to support?
Contribute $25 - $50 and receive a Champagne Campaign 
Contribute $100 and receive a hat plus ONE invitation to our Funding Celebration*
Contribute $200 and receive a hat plus TWO invitation to our Funding Celebration*
(* Upon complete funding, the celebration will be held in Austin, Texas*)

The Impact
We set out to start a company that brought us together as friends, sisters and to set an example for other women to follow their dreams and support each other. 
Ana has a background in retail business management, event production, client relations and company budgets. Her professional advancements have afforded her the learning to run a start up company with a profitable margin as well as the connections to strategically place Champagne Supply Co. in front of the area's event influencers. Experience in event planning, she has managed event budgets for clients up to $200,000 per event, planned multiple events at the same time and managed client communications and business development.
Gabrielle has achieved a successful career in corporate sales. She has been ranked in the top 5 (place 3 and 4th) sales executive for 3 years in a row.  Her training in this sales position brings proven tactics to Champagne Supply for optimal growth in numbers. Bringing to the team the ability to see the “40,000 Foot View,” she sees the big picture and how current decision might effect the future of the company. 

We have big plans and they don't stop with two trucks. Our long term plan is to franchise into 3 different markets by 2020. This is just the beginning.
What if we don't reach our funding goal?
If we do not reach our full funding goal, we will use the amount raised towards:
* Full Branding Design - Hire a professional graphic designer to design our full company branding.
* Expand our glassware rental collection.
* Make updates and improvements to our current truck.
* Financially reimburse our parents for their time spent helping set up early morning events. 
* We will even still have a champagne toast to celebrate all the support shown through this campaign!
* For any brides who contributed through the Bride To-Be options, don't worry, your champagne dreams can still come true and we will apply your contribution to the booking of our existing Cushman.

 
Risk Mitigating Factors
Risk 1: Another company taking on the idea.. 
Once the truck is ordered and delivered to the US we will be able to start talking about business to planners and brides with mock ups visuals. Until we have ordered the truck there is a higher chance the idea will be adopted by another company in the United States. Our goal is to be ahead of the market.
Risk 2: Connecting with Venues and Clients
Marketing will need to start taking place before the truck arrives to create awareness. This means staying active on Instagram, attending event networking events and keeping our marketing personal and targeted. 
Risk 3: Liquor Licensing and TABC Laws
Navigating the laws around serving liquor at Texas events is challenging. The risk is misunderstanding the laws and getting fined which would set us back financially us back in the payout schedule. We will combat this risk by taking small licensing steps and partnering with catering companies who have been in the service business for 3+ years as consultants. 
Risk 4: Booking through Wedding Season
To successfully book the truck through out wedding season, we will need to attend venue’s open houses and partner in our markets to show off the truck in order to be booked through Wedding Season. In order to stay ahead of each wedding cycle, we will need to fine tune our marketing plan to target each season of bride when they are booking their services. For Example, Spring 2019 brings will start booking vendors in Fall 2018.

Their goal was to create a company that put pets and their health first, above profits. A company that would operate with integrity and transparency. </p><p>Since it’s inception, Red Dog Deli has been instrumental in setting standards for the emerging real food industry for pets. In addition to creating a quality raw food line under the Red Dog Blue Kat brand, the company and its owner have heavily <strong>invested </strong>in:</p><ol>
<li>
<strong>Education and research</strong> … including building a robust education platform, researching diseases and dietary solutions, hiring a full-time nutritionist to support customers and develop tools and educational materials for pet parents, and ongoing training initiatives.</li>
<li>
<strong>Raw food formulation expertise</strong> by working with leading pet nutrition experts like Dr. Karen Becker, Julie Ann Lee, and Steve Brown. We are continually reviewing our formulas and adjusting them with the most up to date information. </li>
<li>
<strong>Food safety and quality manufacturing standards</strong> including building a state-of-the-art food manufacturing facility and implementing a rigorous food safety program (HACCP Certification). We have a full-time microbiologist and quality control expert on staff. </li>
<li>
<strong>Ethics and sustainability</strong> – we have always believed that all animals should be treated with respect and only use suppliers that share our values and commitment to animal welfare. We are continually reviewing and revising our processing practices and programs to reduce waste and materials used both in our packaging and in our manufacturing process.</li>
</ol><p>We often joke that <strong><i>“We put all our money into your pets’ mouths …”</i></strong>  We always try to keep our pricing as low as possible, but real food is not cheap. By the time we pay for raw materials, labour, delivery costs, and overhead for the facility, there is not much left over. We invest everything that remains into education and raising the bar in the pet food industry … but often this is not enough.  In contrast, kibble companies have large margins (due to the use of low-quality ingredients and/or extensive processing practices) and millions to spend on marketing. </p><p><strong>In 2016 we faced a very difficult and costly decision</strong>. Due to a significant contractor error in the construction of our freezer, our facility would have become unusable in less than a year. We literally had an iceberg forming under our building. We were running out of time and building a new plant required a significant investment.</p><p>In order to be able to move and continue our good work, our only option at the time was to bring in an outside investor group to help us build the new amazing facility that we are in today. For a while, things seemed to be going well … However, most investors don’t often invest in education and social purpose, unless there is a quick financial return. And our investors are no exception.

We are building a campaign for FrontFundr, but this requires funds to both set up the campaign, go through a screening process, and put together all the legal information required for the securities regulations. </p><p>So, part of the initial funds raised in this campaign (roughly $15-20K) will go toward implementing this bigger vision.</p><p>Before we launch this ambitious campaign on FrontFundr to offer the RDBK company to pet parents, we need permission from our current investor group, and they need to know that there are enough passionate pet parents out there who are interested in supporting us. <strong>So, the more funds we can raise ASAP through this Indiegogo campaign</strong>, the more confidence the investor group will have, and the more quickly we can launch the next campaign.</p><p>The rest of the funds raised will go to ensuring we can continue to build our education platform and work on our sustainability initiatives. We have already invested a significant amount into our education platform and want to ensure we can keep going on this.  </p><p><strong>RDBK Goal for Freedom: $2,000,000+ </strong>will be used for educational and sustainability initiatives as described above and to buy our independence. We will be launching a campaign on FrontFundr to raise funds and sell shares for every pet parent that wants to be part of the real food revolution for pets.</p><p>OUR DREAM is to create a company that belongs to YOU - the pet parents, so we can ensure that health is never compromised by corporate greed!  </p><p><strong>If you are an accredited investor and interested in learning more about being a partner in our company or think you can help in another way?

We are building a campaign for FrontFundr, but this requires funds to both set up the campaign, go through a screening process, and put together all the legal information required for the securities regulations. So, part of the initial funds raised in this campaign (roughly $15-20K) will go toward implementing this bigger vision.Before we launch this ambitious campaign on FrontFundr to offer the RDBK company to pet parents, we need permission from our current investor group, and they need to know that there are enough passionate pet parents out there who are interested in supporting us. So, the more funds we can raise ASAP through this Indiegogo campaign, the more confidence the investor group will have, and the more quickly we can launch the next campaign.The rest of the funds raised will go to ensuring we can continue to build our education platform and work on our sustainability initiatives. We have already invested a significant amount into our education platform and want to ensure we can keep going on this.  RDBK Goal for Freedom: $2,000,000+ will be used for educational and sustainability initiatives as described above and to buy our independence. We will be launching a campaign on FrontFundr to raise funds and sell shares for every pet parent that wants to be part of the real food revolution for pets.OUR DREAM is to create a company that belongs to YOU - the pet parents, so we can ensure that health is never compromised by corporate greed!  If you are an accredited investor and interested in learning more about being a partner in our company or think you can help in another way? Please contact us at: campaign@reddogbluekat.com.About Us“Health is a state of complete, physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” –  World Health Organization   As a company, we're committed to creating positive change in the pet food industry and the way we look at nutrition. We envision a world where all food is grown naturally and sustainably and is processed in a manner that preserves its natural nutrients. We envision a world where food safety is based on a natural balance and medicine is based on prevention, not disease and suppression.
We believe integrity and ethics are paramount in life and business.
We are values-driven but profit-responsible. We believe in honoring all business partners, associates, staff, and even our competitors.
We believe in the ethical treatment of all animals.
We believe in food safety (we are HACCP Certified).
Above all, we believe that even a small local company can be a big force for good in the world! 
We're making a substantial investment in educating all pet advocates and pet lovers about food processing, pet food safety, food quality, and other aspects of the food industry that impact the value of the foods we feed our pets.If you want to learn more? We suggest you check out our FREE online LEARNING CENTER and FEEDING GUIDEWe are constantly challenging ourselves to do better and push the bar even higher. As pet parents, we are fortunate to share our lives with amazing dogs and cats who show us daily the real meaning of love and loyalty. We want to empower people to feel informed and free to feed real food to their pets and give them the best chance at a healthy life, free from nutritional disease. Because pets make us better … and we need to do right by them!Other ResourcesThere are volumes of research about food for people that support the link between processed food and disease, and similarly, the link between fresh food and health. There are also studies being done about food for pets (YES, apparently, we need studies to prove that nature was right all along). Check out some of our favorite studies:

Cold brew has a longer extraction process which gives it several advantages over your typical cup of coffee. <strong>The taste is much smoother.</strong> The bitterness of traditional brewed coffee is caused by the extraction of fatty acids, which doesn't happen during the cold brewing process.  Additionally, the acids in regular coffee actually trigger your stomach to pump out gastric acid, which leads to the butterflies in your stomach and leads to heartburn. This means it’s not only easier on your taste buds but on your stomach as well. Cold brew is also bolder than hot coffee. You can easily control the strength by just adding more coffee grounds or letting it extract for longer periods.

It comes with a lifetime guarantee.This brewer is a game changer for your morning, and it's a solution that lasts!  We're standing behind our words with a Lifetime Warranty on the brewer - so if anything ever breaks, we've got you covered. Most cold brewing systems only have a single-layered filter, but we took a scientific approach & used iterative design to create the perfect dual-layered filter. Keep your grounds where they belong - in the filter! For more details, read our section on the filter design. Skip your morning stops at coffee shop with this brewer. It's the quickest morning solution ever. Keep a cold brewer at work! Make brews in your cupholder on a roadtrip. Make it at the hotel while on vacation. If you already cold brew, our system gives you tons of flexibility in how you handle the prep and cleanup process. Our design allows the filter to remain installed while you drink your coffee on the go. Other designs require you to disassemble the brewer and cleanup your used grounds before you can enjoy. Choose between 2 finishes: 'Onyx'; or 'Pearl' shown above.   Let's say you already have the best coffee setup in the world. Can you take it with you when you're away from home? What's your morning flavor on the road? Odds are, it's either a pricey drink from the nearest Starbucks, or it's gross gas station coffee. With our brewer, you can enjoy the bold flavor of cold brew affordably - no matter where life takes you!  We have a saying in the mechanical engineering industry: ""Simpler is Always Better"". We think this applies to everyday products as well. For a product to be great, it must also be simple. We have competitors out there that actually have removable flimsy gaskets. Some of them (we won't name names) have 8 individual pieces that must be assembled before you can brew! We lost our gasket to that 8-piece unit after 2 weeks, rendering it useless.  The Mastermind Kōld Brewer has only 3 pieces to take apart: a filter, lid, & a tumbler. We love the simplicity that this brewer has brought to our daily lives.We can't understate the quality of this filter - we thought you should see the GIF above twice. Read on for a deep dive. Most cold brewing systems only have a single-layered filter, consisting of a stainless steel perforated shell with 200 micron holes. We got tired of making muddy cold brews (with that filter shown above & on the left), so we bought a finer 80 micron mesh filter. That 80 micron filter clogged up really easily, & the coarse mesh was difficult to clean. We knew something had to change for the better.We tested 8 different prototype filters before achieving perfection. The Dual-Layered MK filter uses a 200 micron perforated shell wrapped around a delicate dutch-weaved 120 micron mesh. Having dual-filtration enables us to get the same filtration as the 80 micron unit, but without the clogging issues that plague it. The thin dutch-weave makes the mesh really easy to clean, plus the surgical grade 304ss really doesn't hold onto coffee grounds anyways. Call it innovation.The MagSeal Lid uses magnets to slide open and closed with a satisfying, addicting snap. It doesn't have any nooks or crannies, so it's really easy to clean. It has two ergonomic handles, so that you can remove the lid easier. It's made of BPA-free Tritan material, a unique polymer that's super clear, and strong. It looks like glass until you drop it! The filter twists into the lid without needing a flimsy gasket, so you have one less thing to lose as well.Our Magseal Lid fits All 30oz YETI & Ozark trail tumblers.Our lid does not fit: RTIC or BUILTWe traveled across the world with our travel mug. This picture was taken in Iceland, no joke!We added measures like thicker steel and copper lining to ensure that the brewer can keep itself cold the entire work day without any ice, after spending the night in the fridge. This brewer will also stay cold for up to 24 hours if you add ice and keep the lid closed, which is great for things like traveling & camping.  We tested our brewer for a week backpacking in the wilderness of Yellowstone National Park - it was the ultimate lifestyle test. It's sleek and small, so you can stick it in your backpack or keep it in the work fridge. It creates over 20 ounces of concentrated cold brew before milk, cream or water is added, (or 24 oz of brew if you set up a a balanced brew). This is more than enough brew for the entire day, or you can share it with your friends.Traveling without making an ecological dent is HARD. As we said already, stopping by a Starbucks is easy when you're away from home. But you also contribute to landfills with your disposable cup and straw. Backpackers believe in not leaving a trace, so while roadtripping in Wyoming, we brewed coffee in the cupholders and skipped the coffee stops (Other than Cowboy Coffee in Jackson!). Reduce your plastic footprint and drink great coffee! It's a win-win situation. Even if you're not in the mood for coffee, this brewer is great for making fruit infused water and tea, hot or cold. It's coffee that is brewed slowly by soaking coffee grounds in cold water rather than hot. Cold brew has a longer extraction process which gives it several advantages over your typical cup of coffee. The taste is much smoother. The bitterness of traditional brewed coffee is caused by the extraction of fatty acids, which doesn't happen during the cold brewing process.  Additionally, the acids in regular coffee actually trigger your stomach to pump out gastric acid, which leads to the butterflies in your stomach and leads to heartburn. This means it’s not only easier on your taste buds but on your stomach as well. Cold brew is also bolder than hot coffee. You can easily control the strength by just adding more coffee grounds or letting it extract for longer periods. For those who hate making iced coffee with their normal drippers because it always tastes watered down, cold brew is the perfect fix. Say goodbye to those coffee shop visits for the strong stuff.With the Kōld Brewer, you can become your own barista, easily making delicious and bold drinks yourself. You can finally make Good iced coffee at home, avoiding all the melted ice that plagues hot-brewed iced coffee.In the video, we talked about how we partnered up with Goshen Coffee Company to provide Complimentary coffee beans as a Kickstarter exclusive. What we didn't tell you was that we tried dozens of coffee beans from all over the St. Louis area to find the best ones for cold brew, before we finally bought Goshen Coffee Company's Delicious Bonafide Roast. Doing a blind taste test, Bonafide was head and shoulders SO MUCH BETTER than the competition. We were so blown away that we immediately knew we HAD to partner up.   The Lite Brewer comes with only our filter and lid. Refer back to the 'MAGSEAL LID' Section to learn which tumblers this will fit.This is the main package. Everything but the Lite Brewer is based on multiples of this package. We are in talks with major retailers already (out of Germany if you can believe it), to get products in front of tens of thousands of customers worldwide. We're signing with Amazon Prime immediately once the production run is complete.Eventually, we would love to talk with Bed Bath and Beyond, REI, Dicks, and other sporting goods stores, because our brewing system and future brand line is definitely a great fit there.We are also looking into developing our own special line of coffee roasts this summer, dedicated to cold brewing.",53.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Who is Four Fires Meadery?</h2>
<p>We are just four friends who love to make the best, and most unique meads that we can dream up.  We all met through a mix of home brew clubs, local beer tastings, and events.  It wasn't long before we all realized that we appreciated high end craft beverages, whether it was mead, beer, whiskey, etc., and that we all had a passion for making or experimenting with them.  Through that, we all became really good friends and started brewing and making mead together.  It's been about 3 years now, and about a year and a half since we decided to take the giant leap and go commercial.</p>
<h2>Creation Through Collaboration</h2>
<p>Our motto is ""Creation Through Collaboration,"" and it is with this guiding principle that we seek to come up with unique, bold, and flavorful recipes.  Our focus is to develop a broad range of flavor profiles from simple and elegant to outright insane with nothing being off limits.  With an extensive barrel program in the works, barrel shares, and eventually a sour program, you can be sure there will be an endless flow of rare, unique, and special meads.</p>
<p>For those of you who have been following us over the last year and a half, you may have noticed that we have done several collaborations with breweries, and even a distillery.  Awesome things can happen when people get together to create.  So we intend on continuing these collaborations and can't wait to see who we get to work with in the future.</p>
<h2>The Impact Of Your Generosity</h2>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to have a full functioning taproom/bar, with a large, rotating selection of our meads on tap.  As soon as it's feasible, we will also work to bring in a large selection of beer, and also liquor for mead cocktails.  Our taproom will be a great place to bring friends, enjoy live entertainment, and have a bite to eat with frequent food trucks.  The layout of our facility is set up perfectly for this to happen....unfortunately, it only has one restroom, and no air conditioning.  This is where you come in!</p>
<p>We have already secured enough funding to complete the production portion of the facility, as well as a majority of the taproom, but we need your help to complete the build out.  With only one restroom, the capacity of our taproom will only be 14 people.  With the addition of a second restroom, that capacity will jump closer to 50....so a second restroom is absolutely critical to our success. </p>
<p>As for the HVAC system, we have recieved multiple quotes in the $11,000 range.  The taproom itself stays at a reasonable temperature when empty, but as soon as we fill it with people and kegerators, air conditioning will be a necessity.</p>
<p>Your contributions will go towards these two large, critical items as well as any incidentals with finishing the taproom.</p>

<div>We've decided to create the world's <strong>best</strong> ever <strong>wine course for neophyte</strong> wine enthusiasts.</div>
<p>A course that is far from what the word ""course"" conveys: dry, academic theory. </p>
<p>Course comes from the latin <i>cursus</i> which means journey; and that's exactly what we want to offer:</p>
<p>An<strong> interactive</strong>, <strong>fun</strong> learning journey.</p>
<p>This journey combines <strong>knowledge and experiences</strong>, that together, make learning about wine so magical.</p>
<p>These moments you never forget:</p>
<p>- Visiting a famous <strong>Chateau in Bordeaux</strong>.</p>
<p>- Walking through the historical vineyards of <strong>Burgundy</strong> to see and understand what makes this region so special.</p>
<p>- Enjoying a <strong>guided wine tasting </strong>with the winemaker who produced the wine...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563284758/zdnoqvogaf8ugyq8pbpb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong><i>""Through the use of Virtual Reality, interactive video and our course toolbox we can bring these experiences to you.""</i></strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Best enjoyed with a VR headset (that you also get with the course toolbox)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT'S IN THE COURSE?</strong></h2>
<p>The Art of Wine course combines an <strong>online part</strong> and a  <strong>course toolbox</strong>.</p>
<p>The online part consists of multiple<strong> interactive videos</strong>, including <strong>virtual reality</strong> to fully experience the magic of the voyage, interactive games, exercises and quizzes.</p>
<p>Alongside the interactive course, course toolbox packed with a whole bunch of fun educational tools as well as tasting samples.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE ONLINE PART</strong></h2>
<p>The course is a rich blend (no wine pun intended) of videos where we share with you fascinating wine knowledge, stories and anecdotes.</p>
<p>But it's not just listening there's also lots for you to get stuck in and “do”.</p>
<p>The course is broken down into 3 main parts.</p>
<p>These parts are made up of multiple videos, each around 10 minutes in length.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Part 1: The Origins</strong></h3>
<p>In this part, we look at what the heritage of the 8,000-year history of wine is.</p>
<p>We’ll then go to the vineyards to see how great grapes are produced, and how the wine growing is going to influence your wine.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll discover the differences between the main grape varieties, but also the climate, the heritage of history and other important factors.</p>
<p>From there we’ll head to the winery to look at winemaking and how the choices in the cellar will affect what you have in the glass.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Part 2: Enjoying wine</strong></h3>
<p>In part 2, we’ll focus on how you can enjoy wine to its full.</p>
<p>We’ll obviously be looking at developing your tasting skills, with a focus on being able to perceive all the small details that make great wine special.</p>
<p>We’ll also be working on developing your sense of taste and your sense of smell through various, fun exercises.</p>
<p>But that’s not all… the way you serve wine, what you serve it in, how you prepare it and how the wine is stored all have an enormous impact on how your wine will express itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Part 3: Choosing your wine</strong></h3>
<p>Which wine? What should I get?</p>
<p>That’s one of the most fascinating subjects.</p>
<p>In this part, we’ll start by diving in to the art of food and wine pairing.</p>
<p>We’ll then look at choosing wine whether in a store or a restaurant: different approaches and ways to choose your wine with confidence.</p>
<p>We’ll then look at all the other things you should get to enjoy wine.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Interactive Vineyard and Winery Visits</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563209146/b9z40jwmrztmrsbzqsje.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>This is where the magic all begins.</p>
<p>Being able to walk through vineyards will help you get an altogether other understanding of the wine.</p>
<p>Seeing where the vineyards are situated, how they are planted, with someone explaining why that is, will help be more thank just an eye opener.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Discover Wineries</strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563209283/f2vml7sxq4psenpwcrm1.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A winery's winemaking cellar is a bit like the kitchen of a fine restaurant.</p>
<p>We want to show you the journey of the grape from the moment it is harvested all the way to when it leaves the winery in a bottle.</p>
<p>What happens during the fermentation process?</p>
<p>What does the oak ageing process look like?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563209370/y806mtp03ifj1opbohz6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With our interactive visits, you will be able to walk around the winery and see this crucial part of a wine's life.<br/> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Activities and exercises</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Developing your sense of smell</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563209495/kvnmpdqwnasjhyivylpa.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Smell is probably the most important sense needed in the appreciation and enjoyment of wine.</p>

A course that is far from what the word ""course"" conveys: dry, academic theory. 
Course comes from the latin cursus which means journey; and that's exactly what we want to offer:
An interactive, fun learning journey.
This journey combines knowledge and experiences, that together, make learning about wine so magical.
These moments you never forget:
- Visiting a famous Chateau in Bordeaux.
- Walking through the historical vineyards of Burgundy to see and understand what makes this region so special.
- Enjoying a guided wine tasting with the winemaker who produced the wine...

 
 
 
""Through the use of Virtual Reality, interactive video and our course toolbox we can bring these experiences to you.""
 

Best enjoyed with a VR headset (that you also get with the course toolbox)
 
 
WHAT'S IN THE COURSE?
The Art of Wine course combines an online part and a  course toolbox.
The online part consists of multiple interactive videos, including virtual reality to fully experience the magic of the voyage, interactive games, exercises and quizzes.
Alongside the interactive course, course toolbox packed with a whole bunch of fun educational tools as well as tasting samples.
 
THE ONLINE PART
The course is a rich blend (no wine pun intended) of videos where we share with you fascinating wine knowledge, stories and anecdotes.
But it's not just listening there's also lots for you to get stuck in and “do”.
The course is broken down into 3 main parts.
These parts are made up of multiple videos, each around 10 minutes in length.
 
Part 1: The Origins
In this part, we look at what the heritage of the 8,000-year history of wine is.
We’ll then go to the vineyards to see how great grapes are produced, and how the wine growing is going to influence your wine.
Of course, you’ll discover the differences between the main grape varieties, but also the climate, the heritage of history and other important factors.
From there we’ll head to the winery to look at winemaking and how the choices in the cellar will affect what you have in the glass.
 
Part 2: Enjoying wine
In part 2, we’ll focus on how you can enjoy wine to its full.
We’ll obviously be looking at developing your tasting skills, with a focus on being able to perceive all the small details that make great wine special.
We’ll also be working on developing your sense of taste and your sense of smell through various, fun exercises.
But that’s not all… the way you serve wine, what you serve it in, how you prepare it and how the wine is stored all have an enormous impact on how your wine will express itself.
 
Part 3: Choosing your wine
Which wine? What should I get?
That’s one of the most fascinating subjects.
In this part, we’ll start by diving in to the art of food and wine pairing.
We’ll then look at choosing wine whether in a store or a restaurant: different approaches and ways to choose your wine with confidence.
We’ll then look at all the other things you should get to enjoy wine.
 
Interactive Vineyard and Winery Visits

This is where the magic all begins.
Being able to walk through vineyards will help you get an altogether other understanding of the wine.
Seeing where the vineyards are situated, how they are planted, with someone explaining why that is, will help be more thank just an eye opener.
 
Discover Wineries

 
A winery's winemaking cellar is a bit like the kitchen of a fine restaurant.
We want to show you the journey of the grape from the moment it is harvested all the way to when it leaves the winery in a bottle.
What happens during the fermentation process?
What does the oak ageing process look like?
 

With our interactive visits, you will be able to walk around the winery and see this crucial part of a wine's life. 
Activities and exercises
Developing your sense of smell

Smell is probably the most important sense needed in the appreciation and enjoyment of wine.
We’re creating a whole bunch of fun interactive exercises around the wine scents you get in the course toolbox.
These will help you improve your sense of smell, get a much better appreciation of wines you are tasting as well as see the differences between different grape varieties, and wines.
 

 
 
TRAINING YOUR PALATE
Obviously, your sense of taste is important.
We’ve sending you the primary tastes of wine to help you improve your sense of taste.
In the course toolbox, you get natural powdered forms of tannin, acidity and sweetness.
These come from wine and are isolated to help you get a precise understanding of what they are like in isolation as well as mixed with other tastes but without the flavours that exist in wine.
 
 
TASTING EXERCISES
The course toolbox also includes a selection of a 6 wine samples to help you understand the influences, of grape variety, climate, ageing, blend, and more.

Through the guided tastings, some of which are with the winemakers who produced the wine, you'll learn to see all the small details and secrets hidden in a wine.
As Dali once said:
""Learn the art of tasting and you no longer drink wine but you get to taste its secrets""
 
 
FOOD AND WINE PAIRING

 
Food and wine not only complement each other...   paired them well and you will improve the taste experience of both.
You'll get exercises to learn the art of food and wine pairing.
Ordering wine in a restaurant won't ever be the same again.
 
 
 
THE ART OF WINE TOOLBOX
 

Alongside the online part, the course  toolbox is packed with everything you need to boost your understanding and appreciation of wine.
 


 

 
TASTING SAMPLES
Wine tasting is crucial help you understand wine, which is why we include 6 wine samples in our course toolbox.
These come in 2cl single taster sized samples which is the typical serving you get in wineries.
You'll be tasting each wine in guided tasting, (some of which will be with the winemaker who produced the wine) to help you truly appreciate every tiny detail.
What's the difference between a young wine and an old vintage?
What do oak barrels bring to a wine?
What are the differences between New World and Old World wines?
What are the differences between grape varieties?
These are some of the things you'll be learning during these tastings.
 
 
AROMAS OF WINE

Your sense of smell is the most important sense used in wine appreciation and tasting.
We've included 6 key aroma phials in this box.
These are scents you get to keep and you can go back to regularly.
This kind of training is often used by the world's best sommeliers,  we've created a bunch of enjoyable exercises around them for you to have fun alone or with friends.
 
 
TASTES OF WINES
This often comes as a surprise but there are only 5 tastes our palates can detect:
Salty, sweet, bitter, sour and umami.
Wines only have 3 primary tastes: sweetness, bitterness and sourness.
To understand taste precisely, we're including dehydrated tastes of wines.
All you need to do is add them to a glass of water and you'll be able to truly understand each taste, without having flavours distracting your learning.
 
 
GOOGLE VR HEADSET
To ensure you enjoy each one of our 360 degree and 3D experiences to their full, we're also adding a Google VR headset absolutely free of charge.

 
 
AROMAS POSTER
 

There are numerous aromas that can be found in wine: our poster of the aromas and flavours of wine will help you when tasting wine.
 
COLOURS POSTERS
 

There may only be 3 colours of wine: red, rosé and white. But there are a near incalculable number of different tints and hues for each colour.
We've regrouped many of them into beautiful posters.
 
AN ONLINE COMMUNITY
 
An important part of wine is the social aspect, the sharing.
When you join the Art of Wine Course you will also be part of a closed group with other like minded wine enthusiasts.
You can ask us your questions or ask us for advice, but you can also ask the community, or help others.

<h2>What will the cart look like?</h2>
<p>We are still working on the final plans with our carpenter but the design will be inspired by other carts that we've seen having success in other cities. Here are two examples that I keep coming back to:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524090464/a9nmcv4c8smlufcpjaot.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524090476/yojb5jmo1dhq9ma495bp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>The Company</h2>
<p>The idea for Lost and Found was born out of two of my loves: the first being the city of Indianapolis and the second, delicious coffee. Despite great coffee shops opening in Indy and the surrounding areas, who are continually expanding on quality and service, I noticed that almost every time I would go to a wedding, networking event, conference, or in-office meeting, that the taste of the coffee was almost always terrible -- embarrassingly so. Serving great coffee at your event shouldn't be so daunting. Lost and Found aims to simplify that process by providing locally roasted, ground to order, custom gourmet coffee orders using a fully mobile cart.</p>
<p>Most of our competitors' ideas of ""catered coffee"" is brewing an hour or more before being served and then delivering the final product to the event in cardboard boxes. So what, you may ask. The coffee ends up cold within 30 minutes of arrival and taste like the cardboard box it came in.</p>
<p>L&amp;F will only serve fresh-roasted coffee brewed on-site, not at a home kitchen and brought to your event. Minutes after espresso is brewed, the flavor compounds begin breaking down, degrading flavor, and the sediment in drip coffee settles which disintegrates the full taste that you have come to expect. These two problems will be solved by L&amp;F's mobile cart by brewing each coffee fresh to order, never letting coffee spoil on the counter before being served.</p>
</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Founder</h2>
<p>The earliest memory I have of drinking espresso is in the back of a minivan on the way to gymnastics practice in 2010. I hated coffee at the time but was perpetually tired because I never went to bed early enough. The people I carpooled with would swing by a Starbucks on the way to the gym, and one day I decided to begin ordering espressos as a quick pick-me-up. I remember thinking it was disgusting but being enamored with its mystery and strength, not to mention the effect it had on my energy! I was hooked.</p>
<p>My introduction to brewed coffee came when I stumbled across a black and white video in 2011 of someone walking the viewer through making a french press coffee in detail. Up to this point I had never understood brewing ratios or that there was more than one way to brew coffee at all. I was a senior in high school and never looked at coffee the same again. I took that interest with me to college where I brewed french presses daily in my dorm and continued to study coffee origins and brew methods. Throughout my time at Indiana University, I experimented with different pour over methods and fell in love with creating an accessible experience for people who had never tasted the fullness of coffee that I was discovering.</p>
<p>Over the last seven years of brewing coffee for hundreds of people at home, I’ve also grown to love educating people on what goes into coffee and how to make it themselves. Many think that specialty coffee is hard to get into and requires a massive vocabulary base, pallet maturity, and an understanding geography, but, in my experience, a great tasting cup of coffee or espresso speaks for itself and even the most novice coffee drinker can taste the difference between a well-made cup of coffee and one made with no care. Initiating someone into specialty coffee is a life passion for me and bringing that experience to a wedding, office, or event is the obvious next step.</p>

<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>The funds raised on this Indiegogo campaign will be pushed right into the payments for all of the equipment needed to get the first mobile coffee cart up and running. The $7,500 goal encompasses the cost for a commercial espresso machine, two coffee grinders, all accessories like scales, milk pitchers, refrigeration, a point of sale device, the lumber for constructing the cart, and all of the other small pieces that go into providing delicious coffee at fast-paced events! </p>
<p>By utilizing Indiegogo's flexible funding option, I will be able to immediately withdraw donations as they come into the account so no time will be wasted in getting the cart up and running.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Timeline</h3>
<p>My goal is to have all of the funds raised by May 10th and have the cart ready for business by June 1st. I've been reaching to out venues, companies, wedding planners, and other event planners over the past couple months and have received tons of positive feedback and many that are ready for this style of a coffee cart to be available in Indianapolis. The city is ready for cafe-quality coffee at its events, so let's give it what it wants!</p>

 MeoMitt is an ultimate revolutionary oven mitt.
MeoMitt will make you forget all the potholders or oven mitts that you have at home.
According to Consumer Reports, cooking related fires and burns top the list of kitchen injuries each year. Fires involving cooking equipment account for two of every five home fires reported. MeoMitt was created to stop those injuries and allow you to protect yourself instantly. We all know these horrible potholders ;( 
 
The idea of MeoMitt is to protect yourself easily and instantly from hot dishes or hot devices in your Kitchen. When you take MeoMitt, you feel like you have nothing in your fingers but that you have that power you can’t burn yourself when you take something hot.

For some dishes or pans, it is necessary to have 2 Meomitts. 
 
 
MeoMitts can also be used as protective handles.
 
 
 MeoMitt is the first Magnetic Ergonomic Oven MITT in the world, available instantly when you need it and not when it’s too late !
With its magnetic power, MeoMitt can be placed to the majority of metal surfaces such as fridges, hoods, toasters, ovens, microwaves, credence, etc ... You can also hang it on a simple hook if necessary. With its ergonomic shape, you catch it instantly because the overflowing water or the burning bread do not wait. No need to flip or snap MeoMitt to grab it, you can catch it up instantly wherever you need it !
Get the magnetic power now !
We all know this situation in which the water of our pan starts to overflow and that we do not have time to catch or find the potholder to remove it from the fire. Aren’t we ?
That’s why Meomitt was designed ! To put an end to this situation and even more ! 
 
Multifunction :
Use also MeoMitts to store and hold your other kitchen tools :

 
Use also your MeoMitts as a trivet to put your pan or your dishes :

With the magnetic power, you can even stick the MeoMitts under the pan. Very convenient :

 
With MeoMitt, you'll be able to protect your fingers in 1 second and take every hot stuff in less than 2 seconds.

The heart of the Project is such that can impact the life and health of many people all over the world. The core micro-farming and light manufacturing Project builds-out into packaging and advertising focused on markets for finished product sales first on the Island of Jamaica and then for export.</p><p> </p><p>The Project is essentially green, recycling excess from existing farming projects growing papaya fruit in Jamaica into new farmed and manufactured products on island that may save and preserve lives all around the world.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Business Objective</strong></p><p> </p><p>The Julia Ruffin Project partners with specific micro-farms to grow young papaya leaves and dry them to drink as a tea. The papaya leaf tea is produced with a specific grow method for the consumer market with a goal to look and taste as good as other specialty teas in the high-end market space. The objective of the Project is to produce and make markets for the tea while, with the assistance of qualified researchers, prove and promote its unique life-giving properties. Papaya leaf tea has expectant cash markets and a socially profitable future.</p><p> </p><p>The by-product of the Project is fresh papaya fruit pulp. The pulp will be manufactured into an exquisite dry white wine that contains the basic fermented papaya that may rival the well documented medicinal qualities known in the market as FPP, (Fermented Papaya Product). The Project made and tested the wine product in 2011 and it has been reviewed by an award-winning vintner. Some of the clinical studies and health benefits of fermented papaya are documented in <u>Studies on Papaya Wine</u>, 2013 by V. Robertson, and are also made available on the blog and website at <a href=""http://www.papayaleaves.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.papayaleaves.wordpress.com</a> and  <a href=""http://www.papayaleavesforcancer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.papayaleavesforcancer.com</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Research</strong></p><p> </p><p>The Project researched the history of enzyme therapy specifically related to the unusual occurrence of the enzyme papain in the papaya leaf and its effect as a tea. The research was documented in the paper <u>Studies on Papaya Leaf Tea</u>, 2009 by V.Robertson. The enzyme papain and other protein dissolving enzymes have shown systemic effect on cancers and malaria, inflammation, arthritis, and bronchitis. The tea has also shown effect with our research partner in the lab at Clemson University as applied topically on skin cancers and legions.</p><p> </p><p>In a five year program the Project tested growing the leaves in three states; Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. From this research the Project discovered the opportunities for markets based on a grow method and specie selection to produce young leaves with significant alkaloid material for medicinal use and for the mildest tasting tea. The young leaf tea is milder and more flavorful than a green tea.

The heart of the Project is such that can impact the life and health of many people all over the world. The core micro-farming and light manufacturing Project builds-out into packaging and advertising focused on markets for finished product sales first on the Island of Jamaica and then for export. The Project is essentially green, recycling excess from existing farming projects growing papaya fruit in Jamaica into new farmed and manufactured products on island that may save and preserve lives all around the world.  Business Objective The Julia Ruffin Project partners with specific micro-farms to grow young papaya leaves and dry them to drink as a tea. The papaya leaf tea is produced with a specific grow method for the consumer market with a goal to look and taste as good as other specialty teas in the high-end market space. The objective of the Project is to produce and make markets for the tea while, with the assistance of qualified researchers, prove and promote its unique life-giving properties. Papaya leaf tea has expectant cash markets and a socially profitable future. The by-product of the Project is fresh papaya fruit pulp. The pulp will be manufactured into an exquisite dry white wine that contains the basic fermented papaya that may rival the well documented medicinal qualities known in the market as FPP, (Fermented Papaya Product). The Project made and tested the wine product in 2011 and it has been reviewed by an award-winning vintner. Some of the clinical studies and health benefits of fermented papaya are documented in Studies on Papaya Wine, 2013 by V. Robertson, and are also made available on the blog and website at www.papayaleaves.wordpress.com and  www.papayaleavesforcancer.com Research The Project researched the history of enzyme therapy specifically related to the unusual occurrence of the enzyme papain in the papaya leaf and its effect as a tea. The research was documented in the paper Studies on Papaya Leaf Tea, 2009 by V.Robertson. The enzyme papain and other protein dissolving enzymes have shown systemic effect on cancers and malaria, inflammation, arthritis, and bronchitis. The tea has also shown effect with our research partner in the lab at Clemson University as applied topically on skin cancers and legions. In a five year program the Project tested growing the leaves in three states; Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. From this research the Project discovered the opportunities for markets based on a grow method and specie selection to produce young leaves with significant alkaloid material for medicinal use and for the mildest tasting tea. The young leaf tea is milder and more flavorful than a green tea. The founder of the Charleston Tea Plantation, the only tea plantation in the United States, commented that the tea has a beautiful “cup”, for its color and presentation, and commented that the standard market leaves are bitter. Our young leaf tea is mild and sweet. In September, 2013 Teaview rated our tea 8/10 and commented that “…This young leaf tea definitely ranks among the most unique and memorable teas that I have reviewed over the years”. https://www.teaviews.com/2013/09/24/review-julia-ruffin-project-ltd-papaya-leaf-tea/ Research has continued with the collection of related university studies around the world published on the blog at www.papayaleaves.wordpress.com . In 2014 the Julia Ruffin Project contracted with the University of the West Indies in Mona, Jamaica to study its tea and wine products for their effect on disease, specifically cancer.

<h3>The Maple Leaf Coffee Roasters Story</h3>
<p>I've been guzzling coffee for well over half my life and have always wanted to open my own business.  Over the summer, I realized that the time was right to bring together my love of coffee with my desire to do my own thing.</p>
<p>I'm excited to take the experience I have built roasting my own coffee at home and share it with others in my community.  It's been a life long dream to run my own business and I'm thrilled for next year to be here so I can welcome visitors into the store.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Maple Leaf Coffee Roasters is opening up in February (or March) of 2018.  The work on the store is making great progress and to prepare for that opening date, we need to get a lighted sign ready for the storefront.</p>
<p>Your donation will go straight towards an attractive sign to welcome visitors.  Importantly, this will help us dedicate funds to sourcing high quality beans and equipment for crafting a great cup of coffee.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>&amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Simply put, we want to raise the funds to put a welcoming lighted sign on the front of the store.</p>
<ul>
<li>The estimates for the sign pictured run around $6400 plus permit costs.</li>
<li>You will receive our infinite gratitude for donating any amount.</li>
<li>Limited edition t-shirts, mugs and tote bags are included in most levels.  All levels will receive a bit of coffee to enjoy.</li>
<li>Be so bold as to sponsor a letter (or the logo!) and we will make it worthwhile with even more swag.</li>
<li>All funds will go directly towards the sign cost and any amount above the goal will be put towards equipment purchases.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A great looking sign will go a long way toward attracting attention from people driving by the store, not to mention it will look pretty badass.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to donating, you can help spread the word - share amongst your friends, families and animal companions.  Better yet, come visit when we open in February (or March) of 2018!</p>

Tired of not fitting into my clothes, I went on a low-carb diet and lost 10kg in 3 months! But once I stopped, the weight came back with a vengeance.  Anyone familiar with this?Bye Bye Yo-yo DietingAfter bouts of yo-yo dieting, I realized a key problem: A meal is usually built around a starchy carbohydrate like rice, noodles or mashed potatoes. But have you tried eating bangers without mash? Or curry without rice? To restrict certain foods like mash and rice only serves to make us want it more. I thought why not make a mash or rice from the stuff you're supposed to eat more of anyway. Like good ol' vegetables!Instead of rice, I would have rice-like cauliflower, and instead of mashed potato, I would have mashed cauliflower. But not everyone's on a diet; for each meal, I had to make 2 types of rice or mash – the starchy one, and the veggie one.So cooking took twice as long.I started to look for instant versions but found none. But I did find plenty of other friends with similarly sluggish metabolisms looking for solutions too. For all my fellow carbophobics, after a year of research and development (back story below), we have invented instant Cauliflower Mash for me and you – wherever you are!Hello Zero CuisineThis is how our packaging would look once we hit critical mass. For now, we have durable, food-safe aluminum stand-up pouches with our branding. If you like how this looks, support us by picking a Perk and we'll get there sooner. Thanks!60 Calories, Zero Guilt Cauliflower Mash 
Meet the leaner, better-looking cousin of the traditional mashed potato. Low carb. Low calorie. Low GI. Gluten-free. Preservative-free.
High fiber. High in vitamins. And all natural. Because it's made from cauliflower, herbs, spices, sea salt, guar gum and nothing else. Every pack is made from approximately 1.2kg of fresh cauliflower, and contain all you need (except water) to make 4 servings of 140g of mash. This is the recommended serving size by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). That's one and a half portions of the five servings of vegetables you need daily in one serving!
Also available in Wasabi and Chives for that extra kick.This is how our packaging would look once we hit critical mass. For now, we have durable, food-safe aluminum stand-up pouch with our branding. If you like how this looks, support us by picking a Perk and we'll get there sooner. Thanks!Zero Cuisine, One Solution For Many From Diabetics To Kids Who Refuse To Eat Their Veggies

So far, about 100 family and friends including children have tasted Zero Cuisine's Cauliflower Mash and what do they think of it? They've given it a thumbs up, or should we say spoon up!One Ton Of Zero    So now we have the formula, and we have one of South East Asia's largest vegan / vegetarian manufacturers with the HACCP and Halal certification to help us. For economies of scale, the minimum order is one ton. That's 1000kg. Or roughly equivalent to 10,000 packets of Zero Cuisine Cauliflower Mash so there's probably a few packs with your name on it :)If you're carbophobic like me, please pick a Perk and help end Carbophobia for yourself.If you know a carbophobe, please help him or her by gifting a Perk or forwarding this to them.At the very least, click 'like' to help end Carbophobia.Before Zero: The Back Story After more than a decade as a creative person in advertising, I struggled for a couple of years to stay on to work grueling yet unfulfilling 12- to 15-hour days. Next I decided to try out a role in a social enterprise sector despite a 33% pay cut but it was still not what I wanted. Finally I took a leap of faith to leave the security of a well-paying job and started Zero Cuisine from scratch.Our first 2 products took a whole year to research and develop with much goodwill from friends in manufacturing, food technologists, designer friends, animation and sound artists, business associates and of course, family.

We are Dan McQuade and Paul Neves, and we founded KnowSeafood after having both worked in the seafood industry for decades. We KNOW what goes on when seafood gets pushed to the middlemen – supermarkets. Realistically, seafood goes through anywhere from four to seven middlemen before reaching your plate. Additives, antibiotics, rampant seafood fraud, unsustainable fishing, and food safety problems are widespread, and consumers are left unaware, and don't trust seafood even though they know it is healthier for them.  It’s time to get rid of the middlemen!   We want to solve your “fear of fish” by putting you first.
Connecting you to the people who actually harvest your seafood.Finally, you can follow every piece of seafood we offer from when it leaves the water until you serve it for dinner. We’re focusing on providing the ability to fully discover the people and their story behind your seafood. Join and support us so that we can bring you sustainable and natural seafood you can trust and enjoy, direct from the dock to your doorstep. KnowSeafood, KnowWhy That Matters   According to the USDA, “Overall, about 80-90% of U.S. consumers did not meet their seafood recommendations."" When they dug into reasons why, they found that Americans’ concerns about food safety, mislabeling of imported seafood products and unfamiliarity with preparation methods kept them from buying it.“1-in-4 fish we sampled were mislabeled,” found the New York Attorney General at her state’s supermarkets.“Not knowing what fish is on your plate may present a health risk,” reported National GeographicRampant seafood fraud – about 1-in-5 servings of fish worldwide – causes many people to avoid it altogether rather than risk patronizing shady businesses, support unsustainable fishing, unfair-trade, and risk spending money for a dish destined to fail.  KnowSeafood Seafood with a Story  KnowSeafood skips the broken supply chain. We go straight from dock to door.We are building trust through transparency and we use blockchain technology to share it, prove it, trust it. Your seafood has a story. Be part of the story. We combat seafood fraud and seafood safety by working directly with the fishermen and with blockchain-backed technology, we share this information with you...even before you order. Follow KnowSeafood’s journey from the dock to front door, and then use custom recipes or your own to cook it like a pro. The guaranteed quality, through verifiable tech-driven systems and high sustainability standards, takes the fear out of getting great natural seafood to your plate.KnowSeafood boxes make it easy to discern your flipper from your shrimp and to be proud of your paella! Our Solution   Frozen is FresherBuying fresh seafood isn’t as fresh as you might think.All KnowSeafood is harvested fresh, inspected, & graded. Our KnowSeafood is then filleted/processed and packed into individual portions. Next, we super blast freeze  our seafood at -40°c to -80°c (that’s right, Celsius!) which locks in the natural taste and flavor! All of this is done within hours of being landed at the dock. The next time our KnowSeafood is thawed is when you are getting ready to prepare it and cook it! Thaw/Freeze, Thaw/Freeze etc. just destroys the quality of the seafood.All of our KnowSeafood is only once frozen and that makes a big differenceAlas, why we have a happiness guarantee! We have KnowSeafood shipped to us,and then sent directly to you...that’s it, no middlemen! We only offer seafood that is grown or managed in a sustainable manner, using environmentally friendly packaging, even shipping to you from our facility which is net zero carbon. This is a critical piece of our philosophy that supports our goal to reduce global challenges, such as climate change - one of the greatest threats to wild seafood, bio-diversity, and malnutrition.We will pack KnowSeafood boxes with dry ice – which stays frozen through transit until it reaches your door.We are so confident in our quality, KnowSeafood offers a happiness guarantee.Now that you’re a KnowBuddy, our expectation is that you trust and enjoy all of our seafood, every time you eat! Here are our Perks Each perk box has complimentary shipping included!    - By redeeming one of our perks, you are not locked into an ongoing monthly subscription. After you receive your shipment(s), and we launch our site, then you can BeAKnowBuddy if you'd like! A KnowBuddy saves 5% and receives free shipping on every box that is over $99. A KnowBuddy that orders 12 times a year receives an additional 5% credit on that year's purchases.You can choose from one of our 3 specially selected seafood favorite boxes listed here - don’t worry, you will also be able to build your own box once our site launches!So, for this campaign, choose a box, order it once, or get a special price on a 3-month subscription.  Make It Easy!KnowHow to prepare this awesome seafood as well. We will have our own recipes, recipes from Knowbuddies like you to share, and we will even have recipes from our curated rotating chef series boxes too! The chef’s recipes are amazing! Here’s one from author and chef Barton Seaver for the Aurora Salmon that’s in every box!  Our Aurora Salmon is fed an exceptionally rich, natural marine algae called Verarmaris. This diet innovation not only increases the amount of healthy Omega 3s in our Aurora Salmon, but it also helps conserve the natural biodiversity of our oceans and helps to combat global challenges like climate change and malnutrition.   So, Join us!KnowWhat you’re eating, KnowWhere it came from, and KnowWhy that matters by joining us now to help us reel in our community of seafood-loving food-nerds. Let’s change the way seafood should be bought and start enjoying seafood you can get excited about!   The KnowSeafood Team Daniel McQuade CEO/Co-Founder/Mis-fit I am a co-founder with one of my best friends in KnowSeafood. I’m also a husband, a dad to 3 great sons, one new grandson and a soon to be granddaughter. (Yay finally a girl!)I was recently introduced a “mis-fit” at a global blockchain conference and had a chuckle but realized later it was spot on. I tend to see what’s missing versus what’s already there and then I try to understand why. This “mis-fit” condition has always made me want to challenge, to make things better, to do what’s right, not who is right.Even back in Mid 80s, myself and 2 partners were the first in the US to develop, breed and feed and market cattle that were the first allowed to be called “Natural Night Beef” by the USDA. I was fed up with the use of hormones and antibiotics and fatty beef.I grew up on Buzzards Bay, near Cape Cod, love seafood, love sailing, fishing, lobstering...yes I was very fortunate. However, knowing how really great seafood can be, I became frustrated trying to change the seafood industry's culture for better/safer seafood. The middlemen's first question was always ""how much""?  Well, that's not putting you first. What was also missing was the trust in buying seafood.So we decided to do it ourselves…and I couldn’t be more excited launching KnowSeafood!Join us, let’s do this together!  Paul Neves  COO/Co-FounderAs founders of KnowSeafood, Dan and I are looking forward to sharing our knowledge of seafood with you.My most important job is being a dad to my 2-year-old son, he is the reason for all that I do. I have found purpose in being a better husband, father, son, and person.My family has been in the fishing industry for generations, so I really know what good seafood is. Having made many changes in my life over the past few years, one major change for me was my diet, to be healthy, to live a longer life for my family and myself. We will be very selective in our seafood choices at KnowSeafood, not only for you and your family, but for ours as well. I have “lived” seafood my whole life and sharing my knowledge, my experience about seafood with you is part of my family’s legacy, ensuring the safety and sustainability of our oceans for generations to come. Sahil SachdevCTO / CSO (Chief Smile Officer)Hi Everyone! I am highly curious and passionate entrepreneur and crypto-enthusiast. My strengths and experience lie in leveraging technology to develop innovative products and “better for you” life changing solutions. As CTO for KnowSeafood, I strive to bring the vision of KnowSeafood to life including allowing our customers to trace the journey of their seafood right from sea to home (using blockchain)! From water skiing in Mauritius, to surfing in Santa Monica, and traveling around the world for swim competitions since the age of 6, I have always loved the water. I am excited to share my love of the ocean with all of you through seafood! Beth ClarkeDirector of Brand Strategy / CCO (Chief Calm Officer)I am a hospitality-professional-turned-marketer who is passionate about how great storytelling and targeted messaging can create business changing content. As the KnowSeafood Brand Strategist, I am responsible for implementing the great stories about our seafood, and the stories from the people and parts of the world it comes from. Being a seafood lover, just like you, it has been really rewarding to understand what makes seafood great and surprisingly it’s truly very simple. Put the customer (you) first and do what’s right for them! When I’m not working with KnowSeafood, you can find me calm and happy spending time with my dogs and taking awesome canyon rides on my motorcycle! (Dan keeps asking me when am I going to give that up!). Jared GosselinPlatform & Blockchain Manager / CST (Chief Seafood Tester)I was a picky eater growing up and after learning a little about the typical food supply chain, I'm starting to think it's best I pick up those picky habits again!

<p>Hi Guys</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As I am sure most of you know, we have been running La Marmita since 2015. For those who don’t know us, We for a long time have been the number one restaurant in Fuengirola, serving our “Twisted Tapas”, which encapsulates our background of fine dining, put into a relaxed, and lively informal restaurant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need to be honest about the future of La Marmita. 2020 hit us all hard, but we are not ready to quit ! And we hope our fans and friends feel the same. With a view to opening again in spring 2021, your help and support can take us to the next level</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are looking for donations to help us in the reopening of La Marmita in May 2021, and to help in sustaining this great business through the summer Months</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our vision, dreams and passion have not changed, to use the best ingredients, prepared and served to the best of our abilities in an atmospheric restaurant</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are therefore asking for help in the form of donations to assist us in the quest of keeping this cracking restaurant open for the years to come. No contribution is too large or too small, as we really need your help. Any person donating over 500 euros will receive a 10% discount for life</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are forever grateful to be a part of this funky concept and to you for your contributions. We look forward to seeing you all in person, hopefully at a time when hugging is permitted</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Help comes in all forms.</p>
<p>If you are not able to make a monetary contribution we would really appreciate if you could share your enthusiasm for our project via social media, or by sending links of our campaign to your friends</p>

</div></div>","Hi Guys
 
As I am sure most of you know, we have been running La Marmita since 2015. For those who don’t know us, We for a long time have been the number one restaurant in Fuengirola, serving our “Twisted Tapas”, which encapsulates our background of fine dining, put into a relaxed, and lively informal restaurant.
 
We need to be honest about the future of La Marmita. 2020 hit us all hard, but we are not ready to quit ! And we hope our fans and friends feel the same. With a view to opening again in spring 2021, your help and support can take us to the next level
 
We are looking for donations to help us in the reopening of La Marmita in May 2021, and to help in sustaining this great business through the summer Months
 
Our vision, dreams and passion have not changed, to use the best ingredients, prepared and served to the best of our abilities in an atmospheric restaurant
 
We are therefore asking for help in the form of donations to assist us in the quest of keeping this cracking restaurant open for the years to come. No contribution is too large or too small, as we really need your help. Any person donating over 500 euros will receive a 10% discount for life
 
We are forever grateful to be a part of this funky concept and to you for your contributions. We look forward to seeing you all in person, hopefully at a time when hugging is permitted
 
Help comes in all forms.
If you are not able to make a monetary contribution we would really appreciate if you could share your enthusiasm for our project via social media, or by sending links of our campaign to your friends
