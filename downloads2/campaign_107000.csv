<h3>Logline</h3>
<p>An animated Hip Hop/Afrofuturistic adult satirical comedy series that parodies anime, cartoons, video games, geek culture, and life as a young adult.</p>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>JumpBeat City, a futuristic society on earth, where everything looks and seems otherworldly—but basically all of the same crappy social issues still exist. When identical twins Yeze and Tule accidentally become the subjects of a freak lab experiment, they gain the powers to transform into the mecha robotic suit Funkadelic and the magical girl BangBang.</p>
<p>Through story tropes and character archetypes that anime is known for (including the obnoxiously long title), combined with a unique animation style and a bitingly dry comedic and satirical tone, SSBB will magnify and deconstruct some of the most ridiculous and hilarious socio-historical and political aspects imbedded in their (and consequently our) society.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Well first of all-- we're all gigantic geeks. Manga, Anime, comics, video games, cosplay, programming; you name it, between the three of us, we geek out about it. </p>
<p>But we're also creatives, intellectuals, children of immigrants, and story lovers. Often though, these worlds rarely coincide. Where are all the syfy and fantasy shows, with smart, compelling storylines, and relatable characters-- that truly reflected the world that we live in? </p>
<p>These questions, these desires, are what sparked the idea and propelled the creation of SSBB. We've put our hearts and our souls into this project-- but we need Y'ALL. Our greater team, our community, to take this to another level. We'll need your amazing support and every good vibe you can muster to truly bring the world of SSBB to life.  </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A lot of time, effort, and funds go into animation. Your contributions will help us reach these goals!</p>
<p><u>$10,000</u>- We will produce a fully animated trailer showcasing what you can expect to experience in the world of SSBB! We will also develop more dope and diverse character art to fill out our world!</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals!</strong></p>
<p><u>$50,000</u>- We will produce a fully animated, 10 minute proof of concept episode to include in our pitch package to networks and studios! We will also develop more dope and diverse character art to fill out our world!</p>
<p><u>$100,000</u>- We will produce TWO fully animated, 10 minute episodes as well as more dope and diverse character art to fill out our world!</p>

<h3>More Porsche -- More Fun!</h3>
<p>The 900 Series debuted on MotorTrend TV on April 6, 2020 and aired weekly through the end of June. It was the first real episodic car show dedicated completely to Porsche vehicles. Season #1 just wrapped, but we are eagerly preparing for season #2.</p>
<p>Fans contacted us with all types of feedback, but the most popular request was for us to expand the show from a half-hour to an hour-long show and asked how they could get involved.</p>
<p>So, we've listened and are launched this Indiegogo campaign for season #2 to let fans get more involved in the show, help us expand the show into a full hour, and help us cover more Porsche races and events around the country!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Be an Insider with Special Perks!</h3>
<p>We've heard from a lot of fans since the show began and the feedback we've received the most is folks wanting us to expand into an hour-long show, and for us to cover more Porsche events around the country.</p>
<p>So, we are offering you the opportunity to become an insider of the show with limited edition swag and opportunities to get involved in the show itself while helping us stretch out budget to expand the show in season #2, which would be used to cover additional production expense for the expanded show, and it would provide the funds to cover travel expenses for the talent and crew to film Porsche events all over the country.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Fans Make the Difference</h3>
<p>While The 900 Series team and the production team produce the show on a modest budget, it does take a lot of time and equipment to do it right. So, expanding the show and highlighting more Porsche clubs and enthusiasts will increase the cost of production.</p>
<p>As the only recurring, Porsche-exclusive car show on being produced (that we know of anyway), we want to bring our fans the highest quality and the most fun, showing them different cars, celebrities that love Porsche, and coverage of Porsche events around the country.</p>
<p>Your support will be the difference in making those things happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways To Participate</h3>
<p>We realize that times are tough given the pandemic of 2020, so we understand if your wallet does not allow you to what your heart wants to do, so there are other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the link to this Indiegogo campaign with your friends on social media</li>
<li>Share the social media links of the show to your social media friends</li>
<li>Spread the word about the show with your friends and your PCA region</li>
<li>Let our sponsors know you saw their name or logo in the show when you shop with them</li>
</ul>
<p>We are excited to get started on season #2 and hope to count you among our insiders who help us make it happen!</p>

The 900 Series debuted on MotorTrend TV on April 6, 2020 and aired weekly through the end of June. It was the first real episodic car show dedicated completely to Porsche vehicles. Season #1 just wrapped, but we are eagerly preparing for season #2.
Fans contacted us with all types of feedback, but the most popular request was for us to expand the show from a half-hour to an hour-long show and asked how they could get involved.
So, we've listened and are launched this Indiegogo campaign for season #2 to let fans get more involved in the show, help us expand the show into a full hour, and help us cover more Porsche races and events around the country!

Be an Insider with Special Perks!
We've heard from a lot of fans since the show began and the feedback we've received the most is folks wanting us to expand into an hour-long show, and for us to cover more Porsche events around the country.
So, we are offering you the opportunity to become an insider of the show with limited edition swag and opportunities to get involved in the show itself while helping us stretch out budget to expand the show in season #2, which would be used to cover additional production expense for the expanded show, and it would provide the funds to cover travel expenses for the talent and crew to film Porsche events all over the country.

Our Fans Make the Difference
While The 900 Series team and the production team produce the show on a modest budget, it does take a lot of time and equipment to do it right. So, expanding the show and highlighting more Porsche clubs and enthusiasts will increase the cost of production.
As the only recurring, Porsche-exclusive car show on being produced (that we know of anyway), we want to bring our fans the highest quality and the most fun, showing them different cars, celebrities that love Porsche, and coverage of Porsche events around the country.
Your support will be the difference in making those things happen!

Other Ways To Participate
We realize that times are tough given the pandemic of 2020, so we understand if your wallet does not allow you to what your heart wants to do, so there are other ways you can help:

Share the link to this Indiegogo campaign with your friends on social media
Share the social media links of the show to your social media friends
Spread the word about the show with your friends and your PCA region
Let our sponsors know you saw their name or logo in the show when you shop with them

<h3>Captain Tall Tale's Adventure Club</h3>
<p>Teaching how to adventure safely in the world. </p>
<p>The foundation of the club is to change the world for the better by empowering the next generation with the tools it takes to succeed. </p>
<p>We focus on foundation, how to help guide the youth to be well-rounded adults by the time they turn eighteen. </p>
<p>The program is great for any age and can set strong foundations in adults that would like to learn how to become grounded in a mindset that sets themselves for success. </p>
<p>Each lesson is between one to five minutes. </p>
<p><strong>It's recommended to watch one lesson a day (five days a week)  though adventurers can view as many a day as they desire.  There is a mission at the end of most lessons so it's good to focus and finish a mission before moving on to the next lesson. </strong></p>
<p><strong>How is our teaching different?</strong></p>
<p>Captain Tall Tale's Adventure Clubs' teaching method is focused on practicality, teaching youth what happens in the real world and how to navigate the world by still being moral, just, and caring. </p>
<p>The list of starting programs are: </p>
<p>-<strong>Step Into Adventure</strong>: Foundation learning, morals, leadership, speaking up for self, animal ambassadorship, confidence, morals, culture, health, and much more. </p>
<p><strong>Family Fun Times Adventure</strong>: The program is made to create family togetherness and to build a solid support system within the family. </p>
<p><strong>The Three Steps to Health</strong>: The habits of health are the best tools to succeed. The program teaches Nutrition, Excercise, and Stress Management. </p>
<p><strong>Animal Ambassadorship</strong>: The most caring humans on the planet take care of others and that includes animal companions. The program teaches how to give a voice to animals. </p>
<p><strong>The Future is Yours</strong>: The program teaches the future generation how to build the world they want to live in. The foundation focus of the program teaches culture and how to appreciate other cultures. </p>
<p><strong>Storytime</strong>: An added bonus to being a member of the club is hearing Captain Tall Tale tell stories. Featuring the four-part series that tells the story of ""How Captain Tall Tale Became Tall."" Included are many more original stories such as: How the Cow Trained to Jump Over the Moon, Big Bad Joins the Circus, What I'll Miss the Most, Jack Trials, Meet Mr. Yeah!!, and many many more fantastic stories. </p>
<p>There will be many more programs added, those are just the first to set in motion to change the world for the better. </p>

<li>The narrative of an exotic dancer has never been offered to the mainstream audience from her own perspective.  She has never been more than set dressing or the butt (pun intended) of the joke, let alone anywhere near the focal point of the story.  It's time this tale takes a front seat, and through the vulnerable, human, and fiercely feminine lens that it warrants and deserves.</li>
<li>I think it's noteworthy and highly marketable that I'm writing the 1st Season of <i>Running Laps</i> in it's entirety, an endeavor that is typically taken on by a writing team after the success of the pilot.  Though I hope the show will adopt such a team in the future, bringing a full body of work to the table as a newcomer will help me earn the trust and interest of production industry professionals.</li>
<li>The world of the show is provocative, niche, and widely unexplored.  The atmosphere of Club Athena is something folks rarely stray from the moral high ground to enter, but will they enter it discretely from the comfort of their own home?  The answer is ABSOLUTELY.  Curiosity pressed 'Yes, I'm still watching,' on the cat's Netflix.  In fact, ""niche"" worlds are exactly the what streaming networks seek in selecting content, because that is where the most interesting stories live.</li>

<li>Submit the pitch to networks, production companies, and further funding entities.</li>
<li>Write proposals to state and non-profit film initiatives.</li>
<li>Staff, rehearse, rent space and equipment, and film the pilot episode, which is likely to be a necessary qualifier for certain routes to the green light.</li>

<h2>The Title Of The Show Is Bubbly Brown Sugar...</h2>
<p>And as the name suggests, it’s about<i> love, dreams and every succulent thing in between.</i> But it’s so much more than a series about relationships and toe curling sex with smoking hot brown people. <i>This is Serendipity</i> meets <i>How I Met Your Mother</i>, magical like <i>Amelie,</i> quirky like <i>Chewing Gum </i>and a fairy tale like, <i>Love Is</i>.</p>
<h3>This is a story about the journey of two soulmates destined to find one another in this lifetime.</h3>
<p>Now, these two are not your average soulmates that are meeting in human form just to pass the time until the next incarnation. <strong>These two have been together since the beginning of time</strong>. Their souls have chosen to be reborn only to experience the delight and sheer thrill of finding one another over and over again for an eon.</p>
<p>But as evolved as their souls may be, the human part of them don’t have a clue about what they’re doing and are just trying to figure out this thing called life – just like everyone else on this bloody rock. But no matter how often they fall flat on their faces, it is only a matter of time before they stumble into each other’s arms. It is their destiny.</p>

<h3>A Modern Fairy Tale...</h3>
<p>I want to tell a modern fairy tale about a beautiful young woman and her one true love. They don’t have to battle evils in a mythical kingdom, but they each must ready themselves in their respective ways, before they can meet. So, what does that mean?</p>
<p>The lovers in our story must learn how to stop poking the poop that exists in their lives, so they can move on with it. We can all relate to that – and how hard that can  be. There’s just something so addicting about playing in our own crap. The tone of the show is melodramatic at times, with this quirky/raunchy humor, and a whole ton of love – hell this is a romantic dramedy after all.</p>

<h2>Shattering Myths Around Black Love</h2>
<p>I love love.  I love to watch holiday movies that have this air of magic and wonder weaved throughout the storyline. Out of the 50 Christmas movies I watched or saw promoted on TV last December, I  only recall seeing approximately 5 movies that starred black and brown people. Why is that?</p>
<h3>Do black people care about love? Do they get married?</h3>
<p>Of course we do, and it is important to see that represented on the screen.</p>
<p>There are a plethora of tv programs that suggest there are too few black men are available for marriage; a ton of <i>black</i> movies that showcase toxic and dysfunctional relationships; and let's not get started on the barrage of articles that perpetuate the unlikelihood for finding an elgibible mate for the single black female. </p>
<p>Bubbly Brown Sugar is a series that affirms that a magical love story isn’t reserved for the likes of Barack and Michelle Obama and that a happily ever after is the norm for people of color.</p>
<h2><strong>The Spiritual And Religious </strong></h2>
<p>There is a huge growing population of people that identify as spiritual but not religious. This can take so many different forms and is too broad to tackle in our series. Valuing the importance of connecting with a higher source, Bubbly Brown Sugar gives voice to those that were raised in the church and have an affinity for reading sacred texts, but also incorporate other spiritual practices to deepen their relationship with Source. When you see faith-based programming, it only paints one picture and leaves this audience out. Bubbly Brown Sugar gives voice to those that do not allow dogma to hinder their pursuit for God.</p>

<h2>How The Funds Will Be Used</h2>
<p>Nothing great can be accomplished alone and your contribution is a wonderful act of love that we cherish. Bubbly Brown Sugar started out as an idea that popped into Tamala's head while sitting in rush hour traffic, and less than a year later, she has been watering this seed everyday and now it is time to take it to the next level... and we need you to make that happen. </p>
<p>We’ve already begun pre-production of the film including rewrites of the script and three table readings to nail down the story, auditions to book every character (everyone is cast!), and iron out the logistics like budget, locations, equipment, and insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Everything you contribute will go towards production costs to create a first-rate series that you will be proud of. </strong></p>
<h3>Here’s the longer list of needs:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>SAG day/rate for cast members </strong>because everyone deserves to receive compensation for their gifts and time. This is very important.</li>
<li>
<strong>Production crew for the whole shoot</strong> (director of photography, camera operator, 1st assistant camera, 2nd assistant camera, gaffer, script supervisor, grip &amp; electric)</li>
<li>
<strong>Lighting, and sound equipment</strong> (Camera rental already provided by our DP)</li>
<li>
<strong>Editing in post-production</strong> (color correction, composition, sound matching)</li>
<li>
<strong>Music</strong> (custom songwriting and recording from RYDE Productions)</li>
<li>
<strong>Art department</strong> (set design, costume design, graphic designer, hair &amp; makeup stylist)</li>
<li>
<strong>Craft services </strong>(a fancy phrase for FOOD)</li>
<li>
<strong>Locations &amp; permits</strong> (including two conference rooms, a dance studio, and two apartments for a majority of the scenes)</li>
<li>
<strong>Insurance</strong> ($1,200 alone, we need it for permits and to be safe)</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing</strong> (submitting to film festivals and doing PR for the film costs money)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re shooting the film for ten days toward the end of October, and aiming for a post-production completion date of early 2019. In terms of risks and challenges, as with any ultra low-budget project  there may be unforeseen delays. No matter what, we promise to keep you updated throughout the process and let you know if we foresee any updates to our completion timeline.</p>

</div></div>","The Title Of The Show Is Bubbly Brown Sugar...
And as the name suggests, it’s about love, dreams and every succulent thing in between. But it’s so much more than a series about relationships and toe curling sex with smoking hot brown people. This is Serendipity meets How I Met Your Mother, magical like Amelie, quirky like Chewing Gum and a fairy tale like, Love Is.
This is a story about the journey of two soulmates destined to find one another in this lifetime.
Now, these two are not your average soulmates that are meeting in human form just to pass the time until the next incarnation. These two have been together since the beginning of time. Their souls have chosen to be reborn only to experience the delight and sheer thrill of finding one another over and over again for an eon.
But as evolved as their souls may be, the human part of them don’t have a clue about what they’re doing and are just trying to figure out this thing called life – just like everyone else on this bloody rock. But no matter how often they fall flat on their faces, it is only a matter of time before they stumble into each other’s arms. It is their destiny.

A Modern Fairy Tale...
I want to tell a modern fairy tale about a beautiful young woman and her one true love. They don’t have to battle evils in a mythical kingdom, but they each must ready themselves in their respective ways, before they can meet. So, what does that mean?
The lovers in our story must learn how to stop poking the poop that exists in their lives, so they can move on with it. We can all relate to that – and how hard that can  be. There’s just something so addicting about playing in our own crap. The tone of the show is melodramatic at times, with this quirky/raunchy humor, and a whole ton of love – hell this is a romantic dramedy after all.

Shattering Myths Around Black Love
I love love.  I love to watch holiday movies that have this air of magic and wonder weaved throughout the storyline. Out of the 50 Christmas movies I watched or saw promoted on TV last December, I  only recall seeing approximately 5 movies that starred black and brown people. Why is that?
Do black people care about love? Do they get married?
Of course we do, and it is important to see that represented on the screen.
There are a plethora of tv programs that suggest there are too few black men are available for marriage; a ton of black movies that showcase toxic and dysfunctional relationships; and let's not get started on the barrage of articles that perpetuate the unlikelihood for finding an elgibible mate for the single black female. 
Bubbly Brown Sugar is a series that affirms that a magical love story isn’t reserved for the likes of Barack and Michelle Obama and that a happily ever after is the norm for people of color.
The Spiritual And Religious 
There is a huge growing population of people that identify as spiritual but not religious. This can take so many different forms and is too broad to tackle in our series. Valuing the importance of connecting with a higher source, Bubbly Brown Sugar gives voice to those that were raised in the church and have an affinity for reading sacred texts, but also incorporate other spiritual practices to deepen their relationship with Source. When you see faith-based programming, it only paints one picture and leaves this audience out. Bubbly Brown Sugar gives voice to those that do not allow dogma to hinder their pursuit for God.

How The Funds Will Be Used
Nothing great can be accomplished alone and your contribution is a wonderful act of love that we cherish. Bubbly Brown Sugar started out as an idea that popped into Tamala's head while sitting in rush hour traffic, and less than a year later, she has been watering this seed everyday and now it is time to take it to the next level... and we need you to make that happen. 
We’ve already begun pre-production of the film including rewrites of the script and three table readings to nail down the story, auditions to book every character (everyone is cast!), and iron out the logistics like budget, locations, equipment, and insurance.
Everything you contribute will go towards production costs to create a first-rate series that you will be proud of. 
Here’s the longer list of needs:


SAG day/rate for cast members because everyone deserves to receive compensation for their gifts and time. This is very important.

Production crew for the whole shoot (director of photography, camera operator, 1st assistant camera, 2nd assistant camera, gaffer, script supervisor, grip & electric)

Lighting, and sound equipment (Camera rental already provided by our DP)

Editing in post-production (color correction, composition, sound matching)

Music (custom songwriting and recording from RYDE Productions)

Art department (set design, costume design, graphic designer, hair & makeup stylist)

Craft services (a fancy phrase for FOOD)

Locations & permits (including two conference rooms, a dance studio, and two apartments for a majority of the scenes)

Insurance ($1,200 alone, we need it for permits and to be safe)

Marketing (submitting to film festivals and doing PR for the film costs money)

We’re shooting the film for ten days toward the end of October, and aiming for a post-production completion date of early 2019. In terms of risks and challenges, as with any ultra low-budget project  there may be unforeseen delays. No matter what, we promise to keep you updated throughout the process and let you know if we foresee any updates to our completion timeline.

Love is an EXCHANGE of energy and if you decide to love on us, it is a PLEASURE to send that energy right back. We spent so much time thinking of fun perks to show our appreciation and gratitude. As a backer of this series, you get some pretty dope Bubbly Brown Sugar SWAG!

Huge thanks to Jane Middle Art for the beautiful illustrations!

<h3>So here we are...</h3>
<p>Actor and Producer-Christopher J. Prado, Actor and Assistant Director-Fausto Olmos Renteria, Crime Novelist-Mark P. Sadler, Actor and Executive Producer-Solomon Carranza. Friends, colleagues and now collaborators. Some of you may know us from the films ""Sacred Goals"", ""El Patron"", ""Amazed By You"" by Avondale Pictures and the novels, ""Blood On His Hands"" and ""Kettle of Vultures"", some of you may know us personally, and many of you probably don't know us at all. Regardless, we're here to introduce you to a project that inspires hope. </p>
<p>""You Only Live Twice"" is an episodic narrative drama project we’ve lived and breathed for the last year of our lives. It’s a story formed partly from circumstances Christopher is familiar with, but primarily a fiction following friends dealing with life’s unexpected challenges.</p>
<p> If you think it’s worth your contribution, small or large, you’ll be satisfying the budget for 3 60 minute episodes of “You Only Live Twice.” That’ll make our first season 3 total episodes. The first season scripts are all written, casting is done, rehearsals are underway, locations selected and we’re ready to attack this production as soon as we have the funds. Over the next 60 days, you have the ability to bring this 3 episode series several steps closer to the launch of our first season and well on our way to becoming a full second season of narrative drama television that takes a real look at the recovery side of addiction and the fight it takes to succeed and live a life of purpose and hope.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>Now for the fun part. We’ve put a lot of thought into what we can offer our backers a.k.a., The YOLT Family. We think many of the campaigns that forged a path before us had some incredible ideas, so you’ll see a few familiar incentives. We also dashed in a few things we think are inspiring and original, but we’ll let you be the judge of that. </p>
<p>We’re very grateful for every cent put forward and are looking forward to expressing that gratitude through these incentives and more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are we crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>In an ever-changing landscape of Film and TV, more and more people are taking matters into their own hands and seeing incredible results. We're constantly inspired by filmmakers who fiercely protect their creative integrity. Crowdfunding our budget allows us to do exactly that. We want to remind creatives and audiences alike that there's always interest — and room — for great content. Here you will not only support “You Only Live Twice,”  you will also be showing your belief in independent television.</p>
<p>We’re grateful to take this route because it gives us more creative freedom and the ability to take you on the journey with us — every step of the way. Our incentives will provide you with updates and opportunities to put your own stamp on the series! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
<p>We have a small, but incredibly talented and proficient team of independent filmmakers — a team that’s worked together on multiple projects over the years — actors, producers, cinematographers and sound mixers who have spent over combined decades carving out an efficient and effective system to create peak production value on a modest budget.</p>
<p>Since we already completed the writing and are currently in pre-production on our own, these funds will pay for the production of 3 episodes to make a total of one complete 3 episode season. Our efforts to help minimize production costs will include using several locations we personally own, shooting all episodes on one schedule to save time, and taking nominal pay rates relative to industry standards.</p>
<p>But no matter how cost-effective we are, there will be expenses. Our shoot will last around 4 full months of principal photography on a tight schedule and with a cast and crew of around 15-25 people, it will take significant funds to compensate these warriors fairly. There will also be insurance to buy, food for the crew, make-up and hair, trailers, lights to rent, music licensing and all post-production costs (editing, sound mixing, color grading) amongst a truckload of other line items. The camera and lenses are all supplied by Avai D'Amico, our incredible Director of Photography.

</div></div>","So here we are...
Actor and Producer-Christopher J. Prado, Actor and Assistant Director-Fausto Olmos Renteria, Crime Novelist-Mark P. Sadler, Actor and Executive Producer-Solomon Carranza. Friends, colleagues and now collaborators. Some of you may know us from the films ""Sacred Goals"", ""El Patron"", ""Amazed By You"" by Avondale Pictures and the novels, ""Blood On His Hands"" and ""Kettle of Vultures"", some of you may know us personally, and many of you probably don't know us at all. Regardless, we're here to introduce you to a project that inspires hope. 
""You Only Live Twice"" is an episodic narrative drama project we’ve lived and breathed for the last year of our lives. It’s a story formed partly from circumstances Christopher is familiar with, but primarily a fiction following friends dealing with life’s unexpected challenges.
 If you think it’s worth your contribution, small or large, you’ll be satisfying the budget for 3 60 minute episodes of “You Only Live Twice.” That’ll make our first season 3 total episodes. The first season scripts are all written, casting is done, rehearsals are underway, locations selected and we’re ready to attack this production as soon as we have the funds. Over the next 60 days, you have the ability to bring this 3 episode series several steps closer to the launch of our first season and well on our way to becoming a full second season of narrative drama television that takes a real look at the recovery side of addiction and the fight it takes to succeed and live a life of purpose and hope.  

What's in it for you?
Now for the fun part. We’ve put a lot of thought into what we can offer our backers a.k.a., The YOLT Family. We think many of the campaigns that forged a path before us had some incredible ideas, so you’ll see a few familiar incentives. We also dashed in a few things we think are inspiring and original, but we’ll let you be the judge of that. 
We’re very grateful for every cent put forward and are looking forward to expressing that gratitude through these incentives and more!

Why are we crowdfunding?
In an ever-changing landscape of Film and TV, more and more people are taking matters into their own hands and seeing incredible results. We're constantly inspired by filmmakers who fiercely protect their creative integrity. Crowdfunding our budget allows us to do exactly that. We want to remind creatives and audiences alike that there's always interest — and room — for great content. Here you will not only support “You Only Live Twice,”  you will also be showing your belief in independent television.
We’re grateful to take this route because it gives us more creative freedom and the ability to take you on the journey with us — every step of the way. Our incentives will provide you with updates and opportunities to put your own stamp on the series! 

Where does the money go?
We have a small, but incredibly talented and proficient team of independent filmmakers — a team that’s worked together on multiple projects over the years — actors, producers, cinematographers and sound mixers who have spent over combined decades carving out an efficient and effective system to create peak production value on a modest budget.
Since we already completed the writing and are currently in pre-production on our own, these funds will pay for the production of 3 episodes to make a total of one complete 3 episode season. Our efforts to help minimize production costs will include using several locations we personally own, shooting all episodes on one schedule to save time, and taking nominal pay rates relative to industry standards.
But no matter how cost-effective we are, there will be expenses. Our shoot will last around 4 full months of principal photography on a tight schedule and with a cast and crew of around 15-25 people, it will take significant funds to compensate these warriors fairly. There will also be insurance to buy, food for the crew, make-up and hair, trailers, lights to rent, music licensing and all post-production costs (editing, sound mixing, color grading) amongst a truckload of other line items. The camera and lenses are all supplied by Avai D'Amico, our incredible Director of Photography. Oh and that reminds us, some of our talent will be coming from out of town and even though we will house them in our modest homes, some just may not fit and hotel accommodations will need to be made. But, we are also going to use the hotel as one of our locations so we will be able to make it a multipurpose use along with our own vehicles!
All things considered, the number we’ve set for this campaign allows us to make a season of ""You Only Live Twice"" for the very least amount of money possible. Down to the last woman and man, we are a filmmaking team and family dedicated to the passion and love for storytelling first. 
Tucson is our home town and our team of writers have done a phenomenal job making Tucson a character in the show itself. Featuring the beautiful desert landscape, along with its historic and gorgeous bario district, will enhance the value and drive you to want to really be a part of this production.

How else can I help?
Some people just can't contribute and we understand that.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>This entire project has somewhat of an interesting start. Imagine this: It's night, it's raining, and you're walking down a shadowy street in New York City. The neon signs are reflecting off the rain covered streets and everyone rushes by, completely unaware that you've disconnected from the usual robotic march into the concrete jungle. Then suddenly, synthwave music rushes from your headphones and fills your mind with an idea; a story of mystery that takes place in the year 2058 in a cyberpunk city called Retro-City. Well...here we are! </p>
<p>We had the opportunity to create a couple of episodes for a college class and, to our surprise, it was well received! The one major thing that Retro-City needed was better audio. Essentially, in order to have better audio, we need better equipment. </p>
<p>Which is why we need your help. You would aid us in purchasing new equipment for this web-series. Not only will this improve the overall quality of Retro-City, it will also allow us to access the equipment we need to create more content in the future that we can be proud of.  If you donate, you would be giving us the opportunity to recreate Retro-City with our desired vision, as well as provide White Owl Productions the means to produce future content! </p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Andrew and Emilio </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>Here is a list of the equipment we are planning on buying with the money raised:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shotgun Microphone Boom Set</li>
<li>Lavalier Microphone Set</li>
<li>Portable Digital Audio Recorder</li>
<li>Light Reflectors </li>
<li>Extra Battery Packs for our Cameras</li>
<li>DSLR Shoulder Mount </li>
<li>3 Point Lighting Kit</li>
<li>Camera Field Monitor</li>
<li>2nd Camera</li>
</ul>
<p>For each donation we will be sure to send a special thank you. We are looking into a sending perks that range anywhere from a Retro-City shirt, to a signed virtual script from the cast, or a video call from on set! </p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>The impact that your contributions would make will be incredible. Not only for Retro-City and all of the actors and people working on the web-series, but also for future projects. Being just out of acting college in New York City, there are countless opportunities to collaborate with likeminded artists, actors, writers and directors who we want to work with in creating content. We plan on using the equipment that we buy from your contributions to give White Owl Productions its foundation, that will provide these incredibly creative individuals with the tools they need to turn thought into action! </p>
<p>Know that the sky is the limit when it comes to your donation.  You will be giving actors, writers, directors and many others amazing opportunities to follow their dreams.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The major risk we face at the moment is trying to start and finish shooting for Retro-City before summer ends. Many of the actors that we have cast are not going to be in New York City by the end of the season, so we would need to recast. Also, the majority of the scenes take place at night, so filming in warmer weather would all around easier for everyone.  The sooner we are able to get better equipment, the sooner we can begin production before fall.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Being fresh graduates from college we understand that money can be tight. If you are not able to donate but still want to give Retro-City the best shot it can get, please share this campaign! Use the social media sharing tools already provided by Indiegogo! </p>

<p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to read our campaign. My name is John Wolfe and I am the writer and producer of Wrongfully Convicted - a first of its kind UK male prison drama series. We were set for production in March this year but with the current Covid crisis we had to put it back until just two months ago. Covid has caused a massive impact on all of our lives and has made it harder for me to self-fund this series but needless to say I have strived on and managed to pay for everything needed to date to help launch the careers of everyone involved. We now however need more of a budget for better locations, props and travel costs among other things.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625330500/sosbnw8rgaqpeaml7fjd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2><u><strong>Series Summary</strong></u></h2>
<p>The series follows Vincent Prince, a quiet man from the north east on a night out with his friend - Garry. A series of violent events that were out of their control lead to Vincent being incarcerated for 5 years. We follow Vincent step by step in his life before the events of that evening, the court proceedings and whilst he serves his time in prison. We watch as he witnesses all the horrors of prison and crawls his way to being top dog.</p>
<p>I wrote the series to tell the story of what truly happens in prison. It is written from real inmate’s life stories both past to present and no fabricated life stories.</p>
<p>The production will be made to raise awareness and hopefully rehabilitate people from offending. We also aim to help launch the careers of the actors portraying each role and the crew that are carrying them through it all. As an actor, I understand the difficulty of getting that foot in the door, especially when you aren't too sure how it all works and I am passionate about helping these individuals pursue their passion like I did with mine.</p>
<p>The actors and crew in the production have all been hand-picked to showcase the talent the UK truly has, while creating a one of a kind unique show and some bigger names have come on board to offer their experience and help for the other actors.</p>
<p>We will be looking to take this to a major broadcaster once the pilot episode is made and start a much bigger production with more actors and crew.</p>
<h2><u><strong>What We Need</strong></u></h2>
<p>We expect the series to take 6-9 months to make. As you see from the images we have already started shooting the pilot episode. We seek £10,000 to cover all costs, including UK travel, editing costs, post production, sound and picture grading, etc.</p>
<p>£1,500 towards Camera crew</p>
<p>£1,500 towards Sound</p>
<p>£1,000 to other crew</p>
<p>£4,000 Court room and prison hire.</p>
<p>£1,000 travel expenses for cast</p>
<p>£1,000 Costume and prop hire</p>
<p>We have equipment to shoot the episode, and an enthusiastic network of supporters. We believe strongly in open access and we guarantee to make a free version available of the pilot episode.</p>
<p>Whatever position you hold in respect of crime and punishment, there are hidden stories that need to be told from all sides. This series will tell those stories.</p>
<h2><u><strong>What You Get</strong></u></h2>
<p>We have spent a long time discussing the perks for our campaign and we feel that what we chosen will be warmly welcomed. </p>
<p>We have a range of different perks including social media shout outs, IMDB Thank You credits, signed clapperboards, Executive Producer credits and more. Every penny helps in order to make this dream a reality, whilst giving cast and crew valuable experience on set. If more money is raised than the target, these funds will go into making the production bigger and better, although the standard is already at a extremely high. </p>
<h2><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></h2>
<p>Wrongfully Convicted is a gripping drama of which will tells the story of what life is really like in UK prisons. We hope for this to not only have a story line of which is gripping and immerses the audience but is also educational - as sometimes visuals are the best ways to understand. </p>
<p>We have an amazing cast and crew, who have already been working extremely hard to make this show a reality. They have all put their hearts and souls into this project, we hope to give them the opportunity to continue to grow with us and the show by making the pilot the best it can be. This not only gives everyone useful showreel footage, experience and knowledge but also the chance to build relationships within the industry. We believe in giving as many people the opportunity to hone their craft whilst having fun and enjoyment on a professional set. </p>
<p>We have already won multiple laurels and awards from film festivals for the script of which we hope to win many more. We feel this not only shows the high standard of the script and it's writing but also our professionalism and dedication to Wrongfully Convicted. </p>
<p>Everyone working on the project has a range of skills and understanding - some professionals, semi-professionals and some new talent in the industry - all of whom have and are working extremely well together, all with the same intent to make Wrongfully Convicted the best it can be. </p>
<h2><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges </strong></u></h2>
<p>With any production there is a risk, but we feel that the more we film the more we learn. Throughout this process we have all, already learnt a lot and we continue to learn everyday. We use our different experiences both in life and in the industry in order to educate and train each other. Whilst this can be a challenge, it is also a wonderful opportunity to expand our knowledge and share it too. There are so many different challenges of which we have to overcome on any production, all of which we take as a learning opportunity. These challenges include:</p>
<p>Organisation - This is a very big and important challenge of which we focus on a lot. We are aware that organisation can make or break a production. It is extremely important for everyone to know where they have to be and when, what they need to be doing, what costume they need and so on. We believe that organisation is the way to success. </p>
<p>Shoot Schedule - We have a large cast all shooting on different days and at different times. Having a shoot schedule and sticking to it, is such an important detail in order to keep us running smoothly. </p>
<p>Safety on Set - This is another challenge of which has our focus. Without health and safety in place we would not be making the show. Ultimately, filming is not more important than someone's life. We would rather not film than risk someone. This is very relevant with Covid-19 where we take the rules and regulations very seriously, whilst keeping a watch of any and all updates. We feel at present this is one of our biggest hurdles but with everyone's amazing attitudes to keep each other safe, we are so far succeeding. We require PPE to be worn, social distancing to be kept in place, hand sanitizer is used as well as hand washing on a regular basis. We check everyone's temperatures and have a very open way of communication should anyone have any concerns or feel the need to discuss. If anyone shows any symptoms or feels unwell before or during their shoot times, they will be assessed by the Covid trained team members in order to keep everyone as safe and updated as possible. Not only is this important for Covid-19 reasons but for everyone's general health, safety and well being. </p>

</div></div>","Hello and thank you for taking the time to read our campaign. My name is John Wolfe and I am the writer and producer of Wrongfully Convicted - a first of its kind UK male prison drama series. We were set for production in March this year but with the current Covid crisis we had to put it back until just two months ago. Covid has caused a massive impact on all of our lives and has made it harder for me to self-fund this series but needless to say I have strived on and managed to pay for everything needed to date to help launch the careers of everyone involved. We now however need more of a budget for better locations, props and travel costs among other things.

Series Summary
The series follows Vincent Prince, a quiet man from the north east on a night out with his friend - Garry. A series of violent events that were out of their control lead to Vincent being incarcerated for 5 years. We follow Vincent step by step in his life before the events of that evening, the court proceedings and whilst he serves his time in prison. We watch as he witnesses all the horrors of prison and crawls his way to being top dog.
I wrote the series to tell the story of what truly happens in prison. It is written from real inmate’s life stories both past to present and no fabricated life stories.
The production will be made to raise awareness and hopefully rehabilitate people from offending. We also aim to help launch the careers of the actors portraying each role and the crew that are carrying them through it all. As an actor, I understand the difficulty of getting that foot in the door, especially when you aren't too sure how it all works and I am passionate about helping these individuals pursue their passion like I did with mine.
The actors and crew in the production have all been hand-picked to showcase the talent the UK truly has, while creating a one of a kind unique show and some bigger names have come on board to offer their experience and help for the other actors.
We will be looking to take this to a major broadcaster once the pilot episode is made and start a much bigger production with more actors and crew.
What We Need
We expect the series to take 6-9 months to make. As you see from the images we have already started shooting the pilot episode. We seek £10,000 to cover all costs, including UK travel, editing costs, post production, sound and picture grading, etc.
£1,500 towards Camera crew
£1,500 towards Sound
£1,000 to other crew
£4,000 Court room and prison hire.
£1,000 travel expenses for cast
£1,000 Costume and prop hire
We have equipment to shoot the episode, and an enthusiastic network of supporters. We believe strongly in open access and we guarantee to make a free version available of the pilot episode.
Whatever position you hold in respect of crime and punishment, there are hidden stories that need to be told from all sides. This series will tell those stories.
What You Get
We have spent a long time discussing the perks for our campaign and we feel that what we chosen will be warmly welcomed. 
We have a range of different perks including social media shout outs, IMDB Thank You credits, signed clapperboards, Executive Producer credits and more. Every penny helps in order to make this dream a reality, whilst giving cast and crew valuable experience on set. If more money is raised than the target, these funds will go into making the production bigger and better, although the standard is already at a extremely high. 
The Impact
Wrongfully Convicted is a gripping drama of which will tells the story of what life is really like in UK prisons. We hope for this to not only have a story line of which is gripping and immerses the audience but is also educational - as sometimes visuals are the best ways to understand. 
We have an amazing cast and crew, who have already been working extremely hard to make this show a reality. They have all put their hearts and souls into this project, we hope to give them the opportunity to continue to grow with us and the show by making the pilot the best it can be. This not only gives everyone useful showreel footage, experience and knowledge but also the chance to build relationships within the industry. We believe in giving as many people the opportunity to hone their craft whilst having fun and enjoyment on a professional set. 
We have already won multiple laurels and awards from film festivals for the script of which we hope to win many more. We feel this not only shows the high standard of the script and it's writing but also our professionalism and dedication to Wrongfully Convicted. 
Everyone working on the project has a range of skills and understanding - some professionals, semi-professionals and some new talent in the industry - all of whom have and are working extremely well together, all with the same intent to make Wrongfully Convicted the best it can be. 
Risks & Challenges 
With any production there is a risk, but we feel that the more we film the more we learn. Throughout this process we have all, already learnt a lot and we continue to learn everyday. We use our different experiences both in life and in the industry in order to educate and train each other. Whilst this can be a challenge, it is also a wonderful opportunity to expand our knowledge and share it too. There are so many different challenges of which we have to overcome on any production, all of which we take as a learning opportunity. These challenges include:
Organisation - This is a very big and important challenge of which we focus on a lot. We are aware that organisation can make or break a production. It is extremely important for everyone to know where they have to be and when, what they need to be doing, what costume they need and so on. We believe that organisation is the way to success. 
Shoot Schedule - We have a large cast all shooting on different days and at different times. Having a shoot schedule and sticking to it, is such an important detail in order to keep us running smoothly. 
Safety on Set - This is another challenge of which has our focus. Without health and safety in place we would not be making the show. Ultimately, filming is not more important than someone's life. We would rather not film than risk someone. This is very relevant with Covid-19 where we take the rules and regulations very seriously, whilst keeping a watch of any and all updates. We feel at present this is one of our biggest hurdles but with everyone's amazing attitudes to keep each other safe, we are so far succeeding. We require PPE to be worn, social distancing to be kept in place, hand sanitizer is used as well as hand washing on a regular basis. We check everyone's temperatures and have a very open way of communication should anyone have any concerns or feel the need to discuss. If anyone shows any symptoms or feels unwell before or during their shoot times, they will be assessed by the Covid trained team members in order to keep everyone as safe and updated as possible. Not only is this important for Covid-19 reasons but for everyone's general health, safety and well being.

<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>The Baobab, this magnificent and upside down tree from Africa reminds me to keep an open mind about not only nature but ourselves too. And from an old African myth related to it, that we were all wanderers at one point...</p>
<p>I'm <strong>Ariel Tweto</strong>, an Alaskan Inupiaq  Eskimo, expert wanderer, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Wild_Alaska"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TV personality</a>, <a href=""https://macgillivrayfreeman.com/project/into-americas-wild/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">adventurer</a>, and my new passion is figuring out the origins of our human species! Where did we originate from?  Where are my actual roots?</p>
<p>From somebody whose ancestors crossed the Bering Strait some 30,000 years ago, and who began their journey from Africa some 2M years ago, I am so eager to learn more about Africa and where humanity began! </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am raising money to finish covering costs for an exciting new series about humanity and its origins as seen through the eyes of an Eskimo from Unalakleet, Alaska.</p>
<ul>
<li>This extra amount will cover costs to film a proof of concept for this series that came from the pandemic. The extra costs include extra cars for the film crew (social distancing), drone permits, park permits, scientists, and covid tests and precautions for everyone on the set on a frequent basis.</li>
<li>As a perk, you will be able to receive exclusive videos from me while we are filming on location (filming-of), as well as a copy of the proof of concept reel (after you sign a NAD). I will also encourage you to write me with ideas on what you want to see and even give us editing pointers on the proof of concept we share with you. This is a group effort - which is one of the main points of the series, that as humans we are better when we work together!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, we would film a shorter proof of concept and donate 25% of the funds to the Zara Foundation in Tanzania for the education of Maasai girls in the Ngorongoro area.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are living in a very divisive moment both in our country and on our planet. This level of distrust among ourselves, along with covid-19, has exacerbated tensions between us.</p>
<p>I propose to show that humans were perhaps not always like that. By visiting the sites of our origins as a species, I propose to argue that perhaps empathy was <strong>more</strong> important than weapons when my ancestors started their long trek out of Africa and ended up in Alaska, where I come from.  I will involve scientists in this discussion who both share or disagree with this viewpoint. </p>
<p>I will also show the importance of women in this process, and how it was them  who kept these groups together as they traveled far from their origins and eventually learned how to adapt within the Arctic Circle. Don't estimate girl power 2M years ago!</p>
<p>The 8 episode original series will also interview important scientists in the fields of paleo-anthropology, primatology, sociology and medicine.  I hope to take you to where Jane Goodall did her research with her chimpanzees or Diane Fossey with the gorillas - both women who have made an impact on how we see ourselves as humans. </p>

<p>I will also give you an inside look on how different tribes in Africa live today and how their habits keep them in much better health than ours.</p>
<center><p style=""text-align: left;"">Your contribution will allow these topics to be seen by millions - and most importantly, the idea that as humans, we have many more things in common than differences.

And therefore, that as an American and as a human, we need to learn to look for these common traits in order to survive and better flourish as a society.</p></center>
<p>I have a solid track record in docuseries with 4 years of <strong>Flying Wild Alaska</strong> and recently, an IMAX movie:<strong> Into America's Wild.</strong></p>
<p>I now wish to make my own statement on how to defuse our current divisiveness in the US and the rest of the planet.</p>
<p>And this brings me to <strong>YOU</strong>. We are all in this together.</p>
<p>So please give me a hand, spare some money, and help me in making this inspiring series a reality. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our major obstacle has been the <strong>COVID-19 pandemic</strong>. Filming and investments have ground down to almost a halt with the traditional pathways for financing such ventures. </p>
<p>I come from a small town in Alaska, and as a survivalist I have made it into docuseries and movies. The divisiveness we live, along with the pandemic,  are yet other obstacles that I will overcome with your help. </p>
<p>Help me show the world that as humans we are a better lot than what we have seen lately. </p>
<p>As for the risks, we have scientists on our team that will watch for us with regards to malaria, typhoid, and of course covid. We are filming with a top crew, and we have chosen the most reputable safari group in Serengeti for our transport and lodging. </p>
<p>With your help, we will be able to film and edit a very high quality proof of concept that you can be part of in an effort to help turn our planet around. </p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>In an Alternative &amp; Utopian 2019, as a form of slavery reparations, African-Americans of a certain age must choose who they want to be for the rest of their lives from a list of preset archetypes.</p>
<p>Blaque Brown’s coming of age was supposed to be no different, but it is only when her procedure goes horribly wrong that she realizes that her life has taken a turn for the chaotic. As Blaque’s new identity invalidates everything she once knew about herself and her blackness, she must learn to harness her newfound power to grow into the woman she chose to be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Behind the Story</h3>
<p>When I was younger, kids in elementary and middle school would tell me that I was “not black enough” due to the way I spoke, the music I listened to, the movies I liked, etc. For years, I was widely known as the ""oreo"" in the room– black on the outside, white on the inside, and this destroyed my self-esteem and my own perception of my cultural identity until high school.</p>
<p>In high school, I entered an environment where I was suddenly one of the only black kids and in contrast to my previous years, I suddenly became hyperaware of my blackness and felt uncomfortable on the other end of the spectrum– feeling too black and defined by stereotypes I've never known to be true. As a result, I strayed even further from what I thought my blackness should be and I tried for many years to be something I wasn't.  </p>
<p>Navigating the spectrum of blackness has always been confusing (and at times, discouraging) because to me I’ve always felt ""black enough"".  Coming to college (a less structurally defined institution), I realized that it should be enough to exude blackness simply by just being black. There is no one singular way to be adequately black and I wrote Exotic Blaque as an exploration of that concept.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've always thought of myself as a ""girl-next-door"" type, but I've realized that although I see myself this way, I have rarely (if ever) seen myself represented this way in media. The ""Girl-Next-Door"" archetype has never looked like me, and while that has become ""acceptable"" and gone unquestioned, it most certainly is not true. Relatability isn't gained solely by having a bouncy, blonde ponytail and lily white skin and that is what I hope to prove through this project.</p>
<p>While this campaign is only in support of Exotic Blaque as a proof of concept, the impact of this project continues to look at the bigger picture. The goal is to deconstruct typical archetypal associations and show the many faces and personalities that come along with the potentially limitless representations of blackness in the media.  </p>
<p>I am making this project not only for myself, but for those who feel marginalized and pressured to fit into a specific identity– those who have not seen enough of themselves in the media as it stands today. </p>

<h3>Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We will be shooting over the course of three weekends July 2019, and a significant percentage of the budget is allocated towards <strong>camera rentals </strong>and <strong>various</strong> <strong>equipment.</strong> Additionally, the world of this project is highly stylized, on top of having many science-fiction visual elements and sequences. With this is mind, art department plays a huge factor in the total budget as it includes <strong>costumes</strong>, <strong>hair</strong>, <strong>makeup</strong>, and <strong>props</strong>. Other costs include <strong>craft services</strong> (food) and securing <strong>locations.</strong> </p>

Ways You Can Help
We will be shooting over the course of three weekends July 2019, and a significant percentage of the budget is allocated towards camera rentals and various equipment. Additionally, the world of this project is highly stylized, on top of having many science-fiction visual elements and sequences. With this is mind, art department plays a huge factor in the total budget as it includes costumes, hair, makeup, and props. Other costs include craft services (food) and securing locations. 

We understand that $15,000 is a large number, but considering the demands of this project, it's well worth it and your money surely will not go to waste.
We appreciate anything you can do to help, so regardless of whether or not you choose to donate, please share this page and spread the word about this project! Feel free to share on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or whatever else you can think of! We just want to prove that this story works, that the world is interesting, and that the characters of Exotic Blaque are innovative and worth watching, so let's get people interested!
Thank you for your support!

<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>I'm Zachary Michaels the creator of the web series ""Generation Z""! I created this series back in 2017 and I've been working tirelessly ever since to complete it and now we've just got 1 episode left to film. This series was really important for me to make because when I was a teenager I didn't have anybody who looked like me dealing with mental health and I had nothing to look to, So with ""Generation Z"" I wanted to have different people from various walks of life coming together, finding better ways to deal with their mental health and to create a series that anybody could connect to and learn from.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're hoping to raise $3,500 so we can film the Season 1 finale episode of ""Generation Z""! Realistically we'll likely need more than $3,500 to complete the episode but this money will give us a solid foundation to start on. If you donate to our campaign you'll not only get the satisfaction of helping young artists but you'll be able to claim some cool perks like your name in the credits, a ""Generation Z"" t-shirt, a day on set, a producer credit, tickets to the finale premiere and more! </p>
<p>*If you donated to our initial Indiegogo campaign you can expect to receive any additional physical perks in the coming months!*</p>

<p>Mirador Television wants to unite the small towns and villages of the world through small scale television. A mighty tough task? Yes, but if you do nothing, nothing gets done. There has to be a starting point</p>
<p>Already we speak to our local community through a social media page, LEWES LOCAL TELEVISION MIRADOR but we’ve also established an infrastructure on all the major streaming channels such as Roku, Amazon Fire etc.</p>
<p>This way our television programmes stream across the globe, to the parts that other television channels cannot reach!</p>
<p>We do it through a programme loop of six hours, revolving through the day and week, with the content created by our small team of television professionals.</p>
<p>We’re punching well above our weight, but the project can stand proud against any TV service in the world, including the iconic BBC, PBS, ABC and ITV.</p>
<p>Our production team is mixed. There are grizzled veterans with experience of over 40 years in mainstream TV and young apprentices, just out of college and raring to go.</p>
<p>You can see their combined efforts on miradortelevision.com or on the streaming channels on your phone or smart TV sets.</p>
<p>Its different, its intriguing, its geared to a mature audience, is a bit quirky but perfectly watchable by the family.</p>
<p>We provide information, news, entertainment, comment and a few giggles, while supporting small businesses which are suffering lockdown blues and charities, who have been hit hard by the shift in emphasis to COVID type support from the standard charitable giving who fight cancer, heart disease and mental health.  </p>
<p>But if we are to conquer the world, we need to expand a bit. We need a bit more studio space, a smidgen more equipment and a bit of working capital to go along with it.</p>
<p>We are the Biggest Little Television Channel in the World.</p>
<p>Now we want to make sure everyone knows it.</p>
<p>So we need a little more cash. And that’s why we want daring pioneers who are like ourselves. Ready to achieve the impossible. Ready to take on the big boys, ready to fulfil the Mark Twain proposition, ‘Most men see things as they are. I see them as they could be.’</p>
<p>No little local television unit anywhere has taken up the challenge of being small in size, but so big in heart that we make David loom large in facing Goliath. We think there is room for global ‘tiny towns’ television and we want an army of tiny towners to support us.</p>
<p>So, get on board. It’s going to be a thrilling ride.</p>
<p>We need a few million pounds to get to the final dream. But just for now, we could do with about £20,000 to take the first step outside our own house.</p>
<p>So what does £20,000 buy for Mirador Television?</p>
<p>First, some more space. We operate from a small office and studio combination right now. We would like to double the size of the studio so we can make more programmes. Production is limited by the amount of space and equipment we have. While good weather gives us the ability to shoot outside, COVID has cut down the number of people we can use and the locations we can go to. So a bigger studio is a must.</p>
<p>We are using the miracle of modern technology. We have one good quality video camera, some smaller web cams and we use our phones, along with the fantastic, well priced Apps that allow editing, special effects and animations. The internet sends our programmes to a central distributor who then places them on the streaming channels. Half a billion people worldwide can then see the fantastic creative television programmes that a tiny town’s television can create. Another good quality camera, an improvement to our sound system and some studio bits and bobs need funding.</p>
<p>We are excellent trainers as well. We give chances to grow into the television industry through courses, on the job training and mini apprenticeships. </p>
<p>Another videographer and a part time producer are on the list and some extra space will also be bought. Finally, we need to do some self promotion. Our viewing audience is growing but we want it to speed up. So spending a little on shouting about ourselves is going to count a lot.</p>
<p>£20,000 doesn’t seem a lot, I know. But we have invested almost £40,000 already and the revenue side of things was slow to start. And why shouldn’t it? In the harsh commercial world, the businessman wants a bang for his buck. We’ve spent six months getting the product right. Now we can bang all over the place for the commercial buck, without cutting back on our quality programmes.</p>
<p>We can become self sufficient within a couple of months, but we need a bit of help from our friends, known and soon to be.</p>
<p>The Mirador Television Icon is a medieval helmet, drawn like a statue in Lewes’s Priory Park. The statue stands as a memorial to the Battle of Lewes in 1264, credited by historians as the conflict that sparked English democracy.</p>
<p>So we’re inviting you to become a Knight of Mirador and spark a revolution in the television media industry and make Netflix look ordinary!</p>
<p>There is no other band of media Knights fighting the good fight for local media to make its impact on the world. And let’s face it, the big boys aren’t that interested in getting involved with the more discerning television fan.  </p>
<p>So being a part of Mirador through a knighthood, (COVID has stopped the Queen tapping you on the shoulder with a sword) is a way to spread a great voice across the world, talking in a language the common man can take in.</p>
<p>Mirador was born out of the struggles to establish local TV some five years ago. We had a rough ride when equipment was expensive, the need for manpower was extensive and the support from small investors was stretched.</p>
<p>But we came through the fire and Mirador, established three years ago has slowly proved that the little television project can not only survive in its own little corner, but dare to branch out and win the citizen of the greater world.</p>
<p>We are stubborn, hard working full of self-belief and faith. So Mirador is here to stay. Give a bob or two and stay with us.</p>
<p>Life during COVID is harsh. Money is scarce, we understand that. But you can still help. Spread the word about Mirador to your friends, share our programmes with your friends, point others in the direction of miradortelevision.com, even form a fan and supporters club to back us up. Indiegogo</p>
<p>You’ll get lots of recognition from us. We’ll put your actions on telly. Aunt Maude always wanted to see you on the small screen, didn’t she?</p>
<p>Be a Mirador Knight and help us battle our way across the world. We’re a new set of Crusaders, so join trek. It’s fun but also putting something into our society which right now, it badly needs.</p>

After my mother's untimely death from cancer, I  loaded up my truck, left Alcorn State University and I moved to Beverly. Hills that is. Well, it wasn't actually Beverly Hills, it was Baldwin Hills.  And it wasn't actually a truck, it was a 1983 Nissan Sentra. I moved to Los Angeles to pursue a dream I had had since the age of four. A dream of waiting tables, driving Uber and doing various other thoughtless jobs. All with the hopes of one day seeing my name in lights. However, after 25 years I thought, maybe everything I had been shown in the brochure of following your dreams wasn't true. Then one morning I woke up with a brilliant ideal. How about a web series about a middle-aged man who was the hot ticket back in the day, but had not fulfilled any of his life's dreams or goals. Yes, this is my life.</p><h2>And What Is He Doing</h2><p><strong>Trials &amp; Tribulations of A Former Hot Guy</strong> - is a 3-7 minute, 11 episode romantic comedy web series about Troy Maurice, a former hot guy of the 80’s, 90’s and early 2000’s who wakes up one morning in distress. He realizes after 25 years of living in LA that this hot guy title has netted him nothing. Not only is his acting and writing career not flourishing, but he never got the wife nor had the children he longed for. So, now Troy is on the fast track to get his career rolling along with finding his soulmate to have a child with, all before his 86-year-old father/antagonist dies thinking he was shooting blanks. The only challenge is, Troy has to date women among a demographic that is of childbearing age. Unfortunately, he absolutely loathes that demographic, millennials.</p><p>(Example of an Episode) Episode One: <strong>Mastering the Art of Non-Commun</strong><strong>ication</strong></p><p>The female council members give Troy a tutorial on the various reality TV shows that millennials are interested in, like Love and Hip Hop, Atlanta Housewives, The Kardashians etc... They believe this will give him things to talk about on his date. Troy tells them he is a master of the art of communication and he can find something to talk about with anyone. In the next scene Troy is on his date. His date is not very interested in his conversation and tells him she doesn't watch very much TV. Then  she begins texting on her cell phone. Troy becomes annoyed, but comes up with an idea. He starts texting his date while sitting at the table with her. She responds favorably?</p><p> </p><h2>So, Why Is This Former Hot Guy Bothering Me?</h2><p>Because <strong>I need you</strong>. My producing partners and I believe <strong>$15,000</strong> will allow us to do the following:</p><ul>
<li>Hire Director</li>
<li>Hire Camera person with equipment</li>
<li>Hire Cast</li>
<li>Hire Craft Services</li>
<li>Post production </li>
</ul><p>I have had a dream of being a filmmaker since I was four years old, but let's face facts. My dream is not going to help us find the cure for cancer or aids.

After my mother's untimely death from cancer, I  loaded up my truck, left Alcorn State University and I moved to Beverly. Hills that is. Well, it wasn't actually Beverly Hills, it was Baldwin Hills.  And it wasn't actually a truck, it was a 1983 Nissan Sentra. I moved to Los Angeles to pursue a dream I had had since the age of four. A dream of waiting tables, driving Uber and doing various other thoughtless jobs. All with the hopes of one day seeing my name in lights. However, after 25 years I thought, maybe everything I had been shown in the brochure of following your dreams wasn't true. Then one morning I woke up with a brilliant ideal. How about a web series about a middle-aged man who was the hot ticket back in the day, but had not fulfilled any of his life's dreams or goals. Yes, this is my life.And What Is He DoingTrials & Tribulations of A Former Hot Guy - is a 3-7 minute, 11 episode romantic comedy web series about Troy Maurice, a former hot guy of the 80’s, 90’s and early 2000’s who wakes up one morning in distress. He realizes after 25 years of living in LA that this hot guy title has netted him nothing. Not only is his acting and writing career not flourishing, but he never got the wife nor had the children he longed for. So, now Troy is on the fast track to get his career rolling along with finding his soulmate to have a child with, all before his 86-year-old father/antagonist dies thinking he was shooting blanks. The only challenge is, Troy has to date women among a demographic that is of childbearing age. Unfortunately, he absolutely loathes that demographic, millennials.(Example of an Episode) Episode One: Mastering the Art of Non-CommunicationThe female council members give Troy a tutorial on the various reality TV shows that millennials are interested in, like Love and Hip Hop, Atlanta Housewives, The Kardashians etc... They believe this will give him things to talk about on his date. Troy tells them he is a master of the art of communication and he can find something to talk about with anyone. In the next scene Troy is on his date. His date is not very interested in his conversation and tells him she doesn't watch very much TV. Then  she begins texting on her cell phone. Troy becomes annoyed, but comes up with an idea. He starts texting his date while sitting at the table with her. She responds favorably? So, Why Is This Former Hot Guy Bothering Me?Because I need you. My producing partners and I believe $15,000 will allow us to do the following:
Hire Director
Hire Camera person with equipment
Hire Cast
Hire Craft Services
Post production 
I have had a dream of being a filmmaker since I was four years old, but let's face facts. My dream is not going to help us find the cure for cancer or aids. It's not going to help bring an end to poverty or social injustice. Nor will it help to bring world piece or resolve any other issues we face as a nation. However, I guarantee you that the 3-7 minutes to spend watching one of the 11 episodes of Trials & Tribulation of A Former Hot Guy will make you laugh out loud and  simply remind you of how funny and fun everyday life can be when you don't take yourself or this world  so seriously.

<h3>B-to-C Summary | Creator Statement</h3>
<p>Hey, it's Nikita! If you’re reading this right now, I’ve won half the battle. Because you either care about the series or care about me (or both, which is rad! Or you hate me, and are eager to read this so you can go, “ugh she’s not even funny” in which case, thank you for your closeted obsession!)</p>
<p>If you know me and my style of comedy, you know I do nothing just for the sake of being funny. I always want to call out things we take for granted, to expose hard truths, to have a MESSAGE.</p>
<p>I’ve worked a combined 3+ years of office and startup jobs. And here’s the thing: startups claim to be a paradise away from corporate jobs and offer an experience that traditional workplaces could never have. But it comes at a high and often unclear cost. </p>
<p>But! Paranormal Disruption is not specific to startups - the story is universal for all jobs! Did you walk into work today and go “not these people again?” Would you rather poop at work because you technically get paid for it? Good! You’ll find something you relate to in this series!</p>
<p>If you have a job, you’re not a bad person. In fact, you’re lucky and you’re making money that I desperately want! But we’ve all bought into some lies in the workplace. That's what the series is about.</p>

<h3>Market Penetration | Why Does This Matter? </h3>
<p>Paranormal Disruption is about teasing startup culture, yes. But it's more about individual empowerment in an environment that wants everyone to function as a unit. It’s about finding your voice in an echo chamber and listening to yourself.</p>
<p>And, it's about mental health. A lot of us suffer silently with brains that aren’t our friends. We’re anxious, we doubt ourselves, we think everyone else has it right and somehow we messed up. But sometimes, the best gift we can give ourselves is to end up in a situation so dysfunctional that we wake up and realize our true power.</p>
<p>In a way, it’s meant to empower the voice inside you when something just… isn’t… right.</p>
<p>Also, the protagonist? A badass woman of color. How often do you see <i>those</i> as the leads of a film? There are plenty of stories and perspectives that haven’t been heard just because we don’t have the <u>access</u> to tell them.</p>
<p>And if you’re a woman of color, how much of your REAL life is being your white friend’s sidekick, an exotic token girlfriend, a poster-employee for diversity, a punchline for your accent? None, I hope! You’re a whole person and not someone’s statement! You’ve fallen in love! You’ve experienced loss! You’ve sh*t your pants! My point is, YOU’VE LIVED A LIFE.</p>

These fairies are born from the first seed of a new strain of cannabis, named after terpenes, and are residents of Humboldt county. They are pure in intent and spirit, yet quite naive in their understanding of humans' ways, leading to much of the humor and commentary the show will carry. They are very distinct in personality and relationships to each other and humanity. They have come out from hiding due to the ""acceptance"" of cannabis in our culture with a poignant message to the world about how we are ""missing the mark"". They curse and rant at times, losing their shit, only to remember that they are hosting a news show and they have to keep it together. They also devote some coverage and give props for the moves they see us taking towards sustainability and preservation. Their mission is ultimately to educate about cannabis, environmental issues, social justice issues, and the corporate take over of the world while bringing the ""medicine"" of laughter. Every episode will be having a segment tied to the Emerald Triangle as well, so both tourism aspects and local cannabis related companies get some regular exposure.</p><p> </p><h2>Message to the Emerald Triangle</h2><p>Greetings Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties. We are at a crossroads as a community and our economy is going in the tank. The struggle is real and is impacting ALL businesses in our communities. While corporations move into the cannabis market with regulations on their side, we must find ways to keep revenue flowing here and ways to promote some of our business on a national level for when full legalization comes around. While things may get better when we are able to move product across state lines, there will be the inevitable competition of the GORM spending 10s of millions on their advertising and their pursuit of monopolizing the market. The CannaFairies project is devoted to keeping the Emerald Triangle and its cannabis related companies in the public eye, promoting tourism, and supporting local artists whenever possible. Please consider funding our pilot EARLY as an investment in the Emerald Triangle itself and letting the public know we provide the best cannabis products as well as let them know they won’t go missing or get murdered on a mountain if they visit!</p><h2> </h2><h2>Message to the World</h2><p>Hey World. How's it going? We are at a crossroads as a community and our environment is going in the tank. The struggle is real and impacting ALL life on our planet. While corporations run rampant with sociopathic tendencies, we must find ways to raise awareness and organize for the change that is needed. We have a near endless supply of topics to cover and inform on. CannaFairies can reach millions with vital information and even become an activism hub in time. Please consider funding our pilot as an investment in our future, our children's future, and the future of all living things on the planet. No pressure though. Oh, and hey, SHARING this helps a lot too. We know times are tight for many, but the share will cost you nothing!</p><p> </p><h2>Solid Production Foundation</h2><p>Creator Ben Jacob has extensive experience in the Voice Over field having been a casting director, teacher, and production engineer in Hollywood for many years before moving to Humboldt. Solid casting, character development, and direction for the voices will be the foundation this production will build off of. Fortunately we have an expert in this unique field.</p><p>On top of that Alan Peterson, Professional photographer/videographer/animator brings both his experience and Epic Red set up to our production for top quality live action footage. This adds a depth and quality to this project from the very start.</p><p> </p><h2>What you see vs. What will be - CannaFairies 2.0</h2><p>While we are quite happy with the current line up of CannaFairies created, these are only mock ups for this campaign. Our software and hardware for these initial models and renders is almost 7 years old! So be prepared to see significant upgrades in what will be coming. This will allow for more realism on renders to blend them into live action settings, which we will be doing quite a bit of. As mentioned in our production schedule, one of our first goals will be to revamp and re-create our CannaFairies and we will be sharing with you along the way each new creation to join our FAEK News team!</p><p> </p><h2>Our Campaign Goal</h2><p>This campaign is to fund the pilot episode of FAEK News. From there it would be to get picked up by a network that isn't afraid of a bit of controversy such as HBO, Showtime, Netflix, or Comedy Central to name a few. However if the networks don't catch on right away, we hope to create a Patreon following to keep us moving into episode 2 and beyond as we will have the hardware and software to continue production.</p><p> </p><h2>Supporting local business</h2><p>We are dedicated to supporting local businesses with the CannaFairies project and most perks will be fulfilled using local companies or done in house. Crystal laser sculptures will be done by Swanlund’s Camera in Eureka, gem stones by Chapman’s and Bead Supply Inc., Hemp shirts by Divine Tribe, and so on. We also plan to host an online consignment shop of local artists doing renditions of our CannaFairies in all kinds of mediums. If you are a local artist and have any interest, please shoot us an email! </p><p> </p><h2>Tree Perks</h2><p>As you may have noticed, in each perk we have included the gift of trees being planted. This service will be provided by Trees for the Future (Trees.org), a non-profit that has been doing amazing work for a very long time. They have planted over 149 million trees to date helping many communities rebuild their lives in the process, and sequestered over 192,000 tons of carbon. We know that this campaign, with your support, plants an entire forest while funding the pilot. We also fully intend to continue to offset the CannaFairies footprint by having 20,000 trees planted for each episode we create. In addition we will be creating a FAEK News segment about this collaborative effort!</p><p> </p><h2>Politics</h2><p>The CannaFairies are not champions for any political party. They are independent in their views and see that the government is under corporate rule on both sides. When covering politics, they will be looking directly at the relationship of politicians to corporations, and what impact those corporations are having on our world. The lobbying and corporate money in politics must come to an end, and politicians willing to turn down the GORM’s attempt to buy policy will be recognized and those in the pockets of the GORM will be called out.</p><p> </p><h2>Segments for pilot episode of FAEK News</h2><p>The following are our intended segments for this pilot episode you can support. We hope to cover all these with a few surprises we are keeping under wraps. However, due to time constraints or possible budget issues, we may have to delay some for later episodes.</p><p>1. “The CannaFairies” - an introduction by the Queen giving background on the CannaFairies origin and why they have come out to combat the GORM and their take over of the cannabis industry. This will be the deeper look into what our Indiegogo trailer is alluding to.</p><p>2. “CBD B Healin’” - CannaFairies give an overview of all the ailments CBD has been found to be an effective treatment for. Future episodes will go into more detail on the medical benefits of CBD and how human biology finds cannabinoids to be an incredibly perfect match for health and wellness.</p><p>3. “Profiles in GORM” - CannaFairies will be taking an in depth look at one of these greedy old rich men and how they are shaping our culture with their unlimited financial wealth. We have a short list and plan to keep this as a regular segment as, sadly, there are so many to cover. No mercy will be shown in calling these disgusting individuals out for their crimes against our planet, animals, and the people.</p><p>4. “Your Shit Matters” - This is a one shot segment that will focus on the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary. This incredibly successful, yet little known project, started back in the 70’s. It provides a roadmap for all communities great and small to follow to establish a symbiotic system for waste/sewage management and how it can beautify and create a habitat for wildlife. Truly an amazing success story that we look forward to sharing.</p><p>5. “True Resistance” - This segment will be reoccurring and will focus on individuals and organizations resisting the corporate rule. For our pilot episode we will be looking at Standing Rock - NODAPL, and the Water Protectors who stood firm against the GORM and their truly disturbing tactics to build this unwanted pipeline.</p><p>6. “The indoor grow weather report” - Those who know, know. Haha! Just having a bit of fun here!</p><p>7. “Inside the Emerald Triangle” - This segment will begin with a look at what the legalization and over production of cannabis in California has done so far to our community in the ET. The CannaFairies will interview one or two local business owners to detail the very real struggle of coming into compliance with regulations, and how that has crushed small farms and impacted our local economy.</p><p>8. The “Read a Fucking Book” report - Another reoccurring segment highlighting books with relevance towards progressive thinking and action. Even if you get the audio version, our fairies will be pleased that you received the knowledge provided by this author.</p><p>9. “Plastosis” - CannaFairies look into and provide solutions to our addiction to plastics, the environmental impacts, and the absolute absurdity of continuing this insane practice of production and consumption.</p><p>10. “A New Forest” - This is a one time segment on how we, as a unified group of creators and supporters, planted a massive forest in the making of this pilot. It will be highlighted that all endeavors great and small should consider offsetting their environmental impacts, and how every future episode and project by the CannaFairies will be offset with more trees being planted.</p><p>11. - 13. We got to keep some surprises for you. We know what they are, and so will you as long as we get support! Please consider funding and sharing!</p><p> </p><h2>Production Schedule </h2><p>Starting once Indiegogo funds received:</p><p>Weeks one and two - Acquire new hardware, software, office space, book keeper, web developer, and business lawyer. Set up new content libraries in Daz 3D, test Motion Capture, prep auditions for voice over artists.</p><p>Week three - Begin CannaFairies character creation v 2.0. Set creation 2.0. Begin voice over auditions for the 4 roles we intend to cast. More mo cap testing. Begin stop motion animation for FAEK News intro. Finalize our script for pilot episode.</p><p>Weeks four and five - Record voice over and motion capture for entire show. Begin the “clean up” of mo cap files. Start seeing the CannaFairies come to life.</p><p>Weeks six and seven - Record live action interview segments and possible pick up lines or segments with voice over actors. Continue with animation clean up and begin on final renders. </p><p>Weeks eight through sixteen - Heavy post production and rendering. This will include Photoshop and After Effects graphics, intensive rendering for the fairies, adding particle effects and spells, editing in Premier, mixing audio, creating credits, and the detailed refinements once the episode is pieced together.</p><p>Week seventeen - Hold our live stream “smoke out” with the team and share the pilot with all of you lovely contributors! You guys rock! Thanks so much for supporting this vision!</p><p> </p><h2>Budget</h2><p>The budget requirements are somewhat flexible to produce our pilot episode. The budget set forth is for optimum production, speed, and tools for our team of four. However, if we can reach even half this, we can still make significant headway into the production while working on raising additional funds. If we are over funded we can hire additional team and place the rest towards promotional efforts once completed.</p><p>Animation Design and Production - $35,000</p><p>Live Action Elements - $5,000</p><p>Hardware - $10,000 (2 top end iMacs and 4 iPhones for Mo Cap)</p><p>Writing and Research -  $4500</p><p>Social Media Management and perk fulfillment - $11,000</p><p>Music Licensing and composition - $4000</p><p>Voice Over casting and recording - $5500</p><p>Software - $4000</p><p>Website Development - $1500</p><p>Office space and 2nd hand furnishings- $5000</p><p>Legal and book keeping - $2000</p><p>13% for fees and withholdings for Indiegogo - $11,400</p><p> </p><p>Total Budget = $99,000</p><p> </p><h2>The Team</h2><p>Ben Jacob - Director/Producer/Animation/Writer</p><p>Alan Peterson - Animation/Cinematography/Special Effects/Motion Graphics</p><p>Katy Warner - Social Media Management/Stop Motion Animation/Gift Fulfillment/Finances</p><p>Laurel Jean - Lead Writer/Campaign Promotion/Research</p><p> </p><p>CannaFairies creator, Ben Jacob, has twenty one years experience in audio/visual production. Having spent 8 years in Hollywood as an audio engineer, voice casting director, and in commercial production, he then moved to Humboldt county in 2000 to pursue a happy life. He became self-taught in 3D animation in his spare time using Daz 3D over many years and eventually fell back on his earlier training to produce adult animated content. While successful enough to pay bills in this endeavor, it was unfulfilling on many levels and his drive to create something to “change the world for the better” eventually gave way to the CannaFairies project. His passion lies in protection of the natural world and looking/living outside the box that our culture of consumption has created. Oh and cannabis, he likes cannabis.</p><p>Alan Peterson lives in McKinleyville, California and has been an animator, videographer, editor and photographer for twelve years. He studied film and animation at California College of the Arts, and now dedicates much of his time to documenting the ecology of California’s northern coast, and pretending that global warming won’t kill us all. His work has been featured by the BBC Natural History Unit and National Geographic, as well as independent documentaries about the region’s natural history and infrastructure. Growing up in Oakland, he learned how cruel liberal economics and ideology can be to the poor and people of color, moving him to become a social worker and activist before being priced out of the Bay Area.</p><p>Katy Warner is a McKinleyville-based multimedia artist, specializing in digital printing and screen printing. She grew up in Sacramento, CA and decided to become an artist after receiving a hand-me-down laptop for her 14th birthday. Her life's goal is to illustrate how anyone can become an artist using the wasted and neglected objects our society creates. Her training was in Oakland, CA, receiving her BFA from California College of the Arts in 2009 and her MFA from Mills College in 2013. She is currently a Co-Operator at the Sanctuary, managing their print room and co-supervising their arts programming. She also maintains social media pages for several Humboldt County institutions such as Arts Alive! Humboldt, the Redwood Art Association and the Sanctuary.</p><p>Laurel Jean is a HumCo transplant from SoCal. She has been writing stories since she could talk (which used to get her into trouble). She studied Creative Writing at Humboldt State University, and graduated in 2013 with a dual MA in Literature and Teaching Writing. Currently she teaches English Composition. She also writes porn and is less embarrassed about that than she is about how she used to write fanfiction.</p><p> </p><h2>Challenges</h2><p>There is only one challenge we face other than taking on the GORM. We (Alan Peterson and Ben Jacob) are going from traditional key frame animating to Motion Capture in Daz 3D. We are expecting a sharp learning curve in the first few weeks, but the latest tech is in our favor. It seems to be as easy as recording the voice artist with an app in iPhone, and using bridging software to translate the motions/expressions into Daz. If at any point we don’t see the mo cap being viable, we can fall back on our traditional key frame animating to see the show through. This may cause a slight delay in release time but we can still get to that finish line either way. </p><p> </p><h2>Final Words</h2><p>Thanks for taking the time to read all this and for considering CannaFairies FAEK News as a project to support. We are all passionate about the project and know it will be unique, fun, and educational. We look forward to bringing you the very best in FAEK NEWS!</p></div>","Who are the CannaFairies?CannaFairies are the hosts of FAEK News, a satirical adult news show that is looking at our culture from the outside in.

Every episode will be having a segment tied to the Emerald Triangle as well, so both tourism aspects and local cannabis related companies get some regular exposure. Message to the Emerald TriangleGreetings Humboldt, Mendocino, and Trinity counties. We are at a crossroads as a community and our economy is going in the tank. The struggle is real and is impacting ALL businesses in our communities. While corporations move into the cannabis market with regulations on their side, we must find ways to keep revenue flowing here and ways to promote some of our business on a national level for when full legalization comes around. While things may get better when we are able to move product across state lines, there will be the inevitable competition of the GORM spending 10s of millions on their advertising and their pursuit of monopolizing the market. The CannaFairies project is devoted to keeping the Emerald Triangle and its cannabis related companies in the public eye, promoting tourism, and supporting local artists whenever possible. Please consider funding our pilot EARLY as an investment in the Emerald Triangle itself and letting the public know we provide the best cannabis products as well as let them know they won’t go missing or get murdered on a mountain if they visit! Message to the WorldHey World. How's it going? We are at a crossroads as a community and our environment is going in the tank. The struggle is real and impacting ALL life on our planet. While corporations run rampant with sociopathic tendencies, we must find ways to raise awareness and organize for the change that is needed. We have a near endless supply of topics to cover and inform on. CannaFairies can reach millions with vital information and even become an activism hub in time. Please consider funding our pilot as an investment in our future, our children's future, and the future of all living things on the planet. No pressure though. Oh, and hey, SHARING this helps a lot too. We know times are tight for many, but the share will cost you nothing! Solid Production FoundationCreator Ben Jacob has extensive experience in the Voice Over field having been a casting director, teacher, and production engineer in Hollywood for many years before moving to Humboldt. Solid casting, character development, and direction for the voices will be the foundation this production will build off of. Fortunately we have an expert in this unique field.On top of that Alan Peterson, Professional photographer/videographer/animator brings both his experience and Epic Red set up to our production for top quality live action footage. This adds a depth and quality to this project from the very start. What you see vs. What will be - CannaFairies 2.0While we are quite happy with the current line up of CannaFairies created, these are only mock ups for this campaign. Our software and hardware for these initial models and renders is almost 7 years old! So be prepared to see significant upgrades in what will be coming. This will allow for more realism on renders to blend them into live action settings, which we will be doing quite a bit of. As mentioned in our production schedule, one of our first goals will be to revamp and re-create our CannaFairies and we will be sharing with you along the way each new creation to join our FAEK News team! Our Campaign GoalThis campaign is to fund the pilot episode of FAEK News. From there it would be to get picked up by a network that isn't afraid of a bit of controversy such as HBO, Showtime, Netflix, or Comedy Central to name a few. However if the networks don't catch on right away, we hope to create a Patreon following to keep us moving into episode 2 and beyond as we will have the hardware and software to continue production. Supporting local businessWe are dedicated to supporting local businesses with the CannaFairies project and most perks will be fulfilled using local companies or done in house. Crystal laser sculptures will be done by Swanlund’s Camera in Eureka, gem stones by Chapman’s and Bead Supply Inc., Hemp shirts by Divine Tribe, and so on. We also plan to host an online consignment shop of local artists doing renditions of our CannaFairies in all kinds of mediums. If you are a local artist and have any interest, please shoot us an email!  Tree PerksAs you may have noticed, in each perk we have included the gift of trees being planted. This service will be provided by Trees for the Future (Trees.org), a non-profit that has been doing amazing work for a very long time. They have planted over 149 million trees to date helping many communities rebuild their lives in the process, and sequestered over 192,000 tons of carbon. We know that this campaign, with your support, plants an entire forest while funding the pilot. We also fully intend to continue to offset the CannaFairies footprint by having 20,000 trees planted for each episode we create. In addition we will be creating a FAEK News segment about this collaborative effort! PoliticsThe CannaFairies are not champions for any political party. They are independent in their views and see that the government is under corporate rule on both sides. When covering politics, they will be looking directly at the relationship of politicians to corporations, and what impact those corporations are having on our world. The lobbying and corporate money in politics must come to an end, and politicians willing to turn down the GORM’s attempt to buy policy will be recognized and those in the pockets of the GORM will be called out. Segments for pilot episode of FAEK NewsThe following are our intended segments for this pilot episode you can support. We hope to cover all these with a few surprises we are keeping under wraps. However, due to time constraints or possible budget issues, we may have to delay some for later episodes.1. “The CannaFairies” - an introduction by the Queen giving background on the CannaFairies origin and why they have come out to combat the GORM and their take over of the cannabis industry. This will be the deeper look into what our Indiegogo trailer is alluding to.2. “CBD B Healin’” - CannaFairies give an overview of all the ailments CBD has been found to be an effective treatment for. Future episodes will go into more detail on the medical benefits of CBD and how human biology finds cannabinoids to be an incredibly perfect match for health and wellness.3. “Profiles in GORM” - CannaFairies will be taking an in depth look at one of these greedy old rich men and how they are shaping our culture with their unlimited financial wealth. We have a short list and plan to keep this as a regular segment as, sadly, there are so many to cover. No mercy will be shown in calling these disgusting individuals out for their crimes against our planet, animals, and the people.4. “Your Shit Matters” - This is a one shot segment that will focus on the Arcata Marsh and Wildlife Sanctuary. This incredibly successful, yet little known project, started back in the 70’s. It provides a roadmap for all communities great and small to follow to establish a symbiotic system for waste/sewage management and how it can beautify and create a habitat for wildlife. Truly an amazing success story that we look forward to sharing.5. “True Resistance” - This segment will be reoccurring and will focus on individuals and organizations resisting the corporate rule. For our pilot episode we will be looking at Standing Rock - NODAPL, and the Water Protectors who stood firm against the GORM and their truly disturbing tactics to build this unwanted pipeline.6. “The indoor grow weather report” - Those who know, know. Haha! Just having a bit of fun here!7. “Inside the Emerald Triangle” - This segment will begin with a look at what the legalization and over production of cannabis in California has done so far to our community in the ET. The CannaFairies will interview one or two local business owners to detail the very real struggle of coming into compliance with regulations, and how that has crushed small farms and impacted our local economy.8. The “Read a Fucking Book” report - Another reoccurring segment highlighting books with relevance towards progressive thinking and action. Even if you get the audio version, our fairies will be pleased that you received the knowledge provided by this author.9. “Plastosis” - CannaFairies look into and provide solutions to our addiction to plastics, the environmental impacts, and the absolute absurdity of continuing this insane practice of production and consumption.10. “A New Forest” - This is a one time segment on how we, as a unified group of creators and supporters, planted a massive forest in the making of this pilot. It will be highlighted that all endeavors great and small should consider offsetting their environmental impacts, and how every future episode and project by the CannaFairies will be offset with more trees being planted.11. - 13. We got to keep some surprises for you. We know what they are, and so will you as long as we get support! Please consider funding and sharing! Production Schedule Starting once Indiegogo funds received:Weeks one and two - Acquire new hardware, software, office space, book keeper, web developer, and business lawyer. Set up new content libraries in Daz 3D, test Motion Capture, prep auditions for voice over artists.Week three - Begin CannaFairies character creation v 2.0. Set creation 2.0. Begin voice over auditions for the 4 roles we intend to cast. More mo cap testing. Begin stop motion animation for FAEK News intro. Finalize our script for pilot episode.Weeks four and five - Record voice over and motion capture for entire show. Begin the “clean up” of mo cap files. Start seeing the CannaFairies come to life.Weeks six and seven - Record live action interview segments and possible pick up lines or segments with voice over actors. Continue with animation clean up and begin on final renders. Weeks eight through sixteen - Heavy post production and rendering. This will include Photoshop and After Effects graphics, intensive rendering for the fairies, adding particle effects and spells, editing in Premier, mixing audio, creating credits, and the detailed refinements once the episode is pieced together.Week seventeen - Hold our live stream “smoke out” with the team and share the pilot with all of you lovely contributors! You guys rock! Thanks so much for supporting this vision! BudgetThe budget requirements are somewhat flexible to produce our pilot episode. The budget set forth is for optimum production, speed, and tools for our team of four. However, if we can reach even half this, we can still make significant headway into the production while working on raising additional funds. If we are over funded we can hire additional team and place the rest towards promotional efforts once completed.Animation Design and Production - $35,000Live Action Elements - $5,000Hardware - $10,000 (2 top end iMacs and 4 iPhones for Mo Cap)Writing and Research -  $4500Social Media Management and perk fulfillment - $11,000Music Licensing and composition - $4000Voice Over casting and recording - $5500Software - $4000Website Development - $1500Office space and 2nd hand furnishings- $5000Legal and book keeping - $200013% for fees and withholdings for Indiegogo - $11,400 Total Budget = $99,000 The TeamBen Jacob - Director/Producer/Animation/WriterAlan Peterson - Animation/Cinematography/Special Effects/Motion GraphicsKaty Warner - Social Media Management/Stop Motion Animation/Gift Fulfillment/FinancesLaurel Jean - Lead Writer/Campaign Promotion/Research CannaFairies creator, Ben Jacob, has twenty one years experience in audio/visual production. Having spent 8 years in Hollywood as an audio engineer, voice casting director, and in commercial production, he then moved to Humboldt county in 2000 to pursue a happy life. He became self-taught in 3D animation in his spare time using Daz 3D over many years and eventually fell back on his earlier training to produce adult animated content. While successful enough to pay bills in this endeavor, it was unfulfilling on many levels and his drive to create something to “change the world for the better” eventually gave way to the CannaFairies project. His passion lies in protection of the natural world and looking/living outside the box that our culture of consumption has created. Oh and cannabis, he likes cannabis.Alan Peterson lives in McKinleyville, California and has been an animator, videographer, editor and photographer for twelve years. He studied film and animation at California College of the Arts, and now dedicates much of his time to documenting the ecology of California’s northern coast, and pretending that global warming won’t kill us all. His work has been featured by the BBC Natural History Unit and National Geographic, as well as independent documentaries about the region’s natural history and infrastructure. Growing up in Oakland, he learned how cruel liberal economics and ideology can be to the poor and people of color, moving him to become a social worker and activist before being priced out of the Bay Area.Katy Warner is a McKinleyville-based multimedia artist, specializing in digital printing and screen printing. She grew up in Sacramento, CA and decided to become an artist after receiving a hand-me-down laptop for her 14th birthday. Her life's goal is to illustrate how anyone can become an artist using the wasted and neglected objects our society creates. Her training was in Oakland, CA, receiving her BFA from California College of the Arts in 2009 and her MFA from Mills College in 2013. She is currently a Co-Operator at the Sanctuary, managing their print room and co-supervising their arts programming. She also maintains social media pages for several Humboldt County institutions such as Arts Alive! Humboldt, the Redwood Art Association and the Sanctuary.Laurel Jean is a HumCo transplant from SoCal. She has been writing stories since she could talk (which used to get her into trouble). She studied Creative Writing at Humboldt State University, and graduated in 2013 with a dual MA in Literature and Teaching Writing. Currently she teaches English Composition. She also writes porn and is less embarrassed about that than she is about how she used to write fanfiction. ChallengesThere is only one challenge we face other than taking on the GORM. We (Alan Peterson and Ben Jacob) are going from traditional key frame animating to Motion Capture in Daz 3D. We are expecting a sharp learning curve in the first few weeks, but the latest tech is in our favor. It seems to be as easy as recording the voice artist with an app in iPhone, and using bridging software to translate the motions/expressions into Daz. If at any point we don’t see the mo cap being viable, we can fall back on our traditional key frame animating to see the show through. This may cause a slight delay in release time but we can still get to that finish line either way.  Final WordsThanks for taking the time to read all this and for considering CannaFairies FAEK News as a project to support. We are all passionate about the project and know it will be unique, fun, and educational. We look forward to bringing you the very best in FAEK NEWS!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Hi, we're Olympia Productions, a group of filmmakers and actors from different backgrounds and production companies looking to bring our exciting TV concept to life.
Our writers and producers, Alex Carter (Black For a Cause) and Claire Rose (From Mansfield with Love), have been working on the series plan and scripts since 2015, from a concept by our friend David Green (Out of Bounds Theatre). Now they have gathered a talented creative team to get this show on the road, but we need some funding to get this project going.

Meet the Cast

IMDb/Wikipedia
19-year-old Helen Swann is a demigod, and – unknowingly – Zeus’ daughter. She struggles to balance her studies and social life with keeping her powers under control. Despite her lack of self-confidence, her godly charisma makes her popular, which people are quick to exploit.

IMDb
Formerly king of the gods, Zeus now has no control over the Olympians who are at each other’s throats. He's in a funk, pursuing the temporary highs of drink and sex to remind him of his old life. Zeus has brought the Olympians together, but can he make them a family again?

IMDb
God of the basement apartment, Hades emerges from time to time to bother his brother Zeus. He’s pretty laid back and doesn’t really want to take sides – he is aware he has a reputation as “the evil one”, but doesn’t let anyone know it bothers him.

IMDb
Zeus’ most irritating brother, Poseidon doesn’t live with the Olympians, but he’s constantly haranguing Zeus for money. He aims for a certain lifestyle (yachts, girls, dolphins) and pays for it with money he doesn’t have.

IMDb/YouTube
Goddess of love and beauty, Aphrodite's star has risen in recent years and thus she has a strained relationship with her fellow gods. She runs a popular dating app, longing for the love and admiration she once had.

IMDb
Goddess of wisdom, Athena strives to keep peace between the gods. She is the first to take Helen under her wing, but she’s also the goddess of war, terrifying when she’s angry.

IMDb
Hyperactive psychopomp Hermes hangs around the university, helping people out, but he’s not a student and he doesn’t live with the other Olympians. However, that doesn’t mean he’s not going to get involved in their business.
 
Twitter/Facebook
A former child star, Lucia ""Eris"" Argento has fallen off the wagon and been sent to uni for rehabilitation. An attention seeker, she has built the persona of “Eris”, tabloid-magnet.

IMDb
A half-nymph senior librarian, PhD student and seer, Tiresias is willing to help people out with their problems… sometimes. Tiresias has a friendly rivalry with Athena, who spends most of her time in the university library as well.

Where Your Funding Will Go
 
We want to make this the best it can be, and we also want to be able to reimburse everyone involved for their hard work. That is why we need your help to make Olympia a reality.

£1000 will enable us to cover our pre-production: actors' travel to locations, food expenses, hair and makeup, visual effects, music composition and promotional material. Every little helps - even if you can only spare £1.
We have budgeted for a 15-day shoot, as well as contingency days, rehearsal time and post-production, so going forward we won't skimp on the expenses or additional costs needed to bring our world of gods and monsters to life.

This is a high concept project and we want to do justice to the myths and legends we're adapting, to provide you - the audience - with the high-quality experience of a full-budget TV episode! So please donate if you can! And, you can get some great perks too...
 
 
The Perks
 

Witness the making of the pilot. As the Muse of History, you'll have access to special behind-the-scenes updates and fun videos, as well as a written thank you on social media.
 

Our Muse of Comedy backers will receive an all-important digital copy of the pilot episode itself upon completion!
 

As the Muse of Epic Poetry, enjoy a digital album of songs that were written for - and inspired by - the series.
 

Muse of Music backers will receive an additional digital album featuring the Olympia pilot episode's original score by James Walker. Here's a taster!

 
 

A very personal perk. Muse of Hymns backers will be treated to a ""Thank You"" video from cast and crew, addressed specially to you.
 

Muse of Dance backers get the opportunity to spend a day on set as an extra, meet the cast and crew as we film the pilot, and receive a signed art print to commemorate the occasion!
 

Two lucky Muse of Tragedy backers will each get an exclusive voiceover role in the pilot episode, and join the cast and crew for dinner. You'll also receive a replica ""Trojan Horse"" branded varsity jacket as worn in the show.
 

Muse of Love Poetry backers can enjoy a night at the theatre! You will be treated to two cinema seats for a special premiere of the pilot episode in London.
 

This perk is out of this world! As the Muse of Astronomy, you will be credited as executive producer (both in the pilot and on IMDb), and have a hand in the future of the series.
 
 
Very Special Thanks

The Future of Olympia
 
The pilot episode itself will be pitched to online and streaming TV distributors, with the support of our existing audience (you!). However, the more we make on this campaign, the more we can make going forward. This series could go far and we can't wait to share it with the world!

 
 
Risks & Challenges
 
We will make time to rehearse with the actors before shooting, as well as making risk assessments of locations and scenes. On each shooting day we will view the rushes on field monitors and computers to ensure we have the footage we need to move on, and reduce the need for reshoots.
Physical locations may change, but they are written in broad enough terms to be able to accommodate potential changes. The pilot has minimal stunts, but following health and safety protocol we will work to ensure that everyone is safe in scenes involving cars and swords.
 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
 
We appreciate even the smallest donations, but if there's no way you can contribute monetarily, please share our campaign on your social media, by email, and even in person - with your friends, family and anyone else who may be interested!

<h3>Once Upon a Time...</h3>
<p>There was a nerdy actress in Los Angeles who realized that her group of friends consisted almost exclusively of professional RPG players and professional princesses. How can you resist a mashup like that?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534546550/lgz1olsujdnzvrk46tsg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And here's the good news: We have scripts for 6 more episodes, a full season of Royal RPG (that's role-playing game) antics! And we've already filmed the pilot!  It's full of nerdy, silly shenanigans that we hope to release after the <i>next two</i> episodes are funded.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534546895/ztiaf7c9dsyj0mggwxkx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Here's where you come in, kind stranger/new best friend. We have everything ready to go, but filming a web series takes resources and we need all the help we can get!</p>
<p>All fundraising will go straight to offsetting the costs of production: Renting equipment, locations, paying our hardworking cast and crew, feeding, clothing, and wigging the princesses, dressing the set, etc. This project has been a labor of love by everyone involved, and we just need a little boost to share the full season with you! </p>
<h3>We've Got Gadgets and Gizmos Aplenty...</h3>
</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534549455/ycbulnn9niy6wzknoars.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A shiny RED Camera! Professionally styled, custom wigs! Handmade props and costume pieces!</p>
<p>~We just need some help from our Fairy Godmothers to pay for them~</p>
<p>We were fortunate enough to be able to film the pilot ourselves, but we have 6 more episodes we would love to bring to life. This show means the world to us, and that means we want to make it the best that it can be. We want our princesses to shine!</p>
<p>With that in mind, each episode costs about $10,000 to make. That covers everything from the highest quality equipment and wigs, to competitive compensation for the cast and crew. Here's a breakdown of the expected budget for each episode: </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535081377/fbwebhzoqgduhqzorlvx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>A Dream is a wish your heart makes...</h3>
<p>And we have the power to make those dreams a reality!</p>
<p>At its heart, ""Damsels, Dice, and Everything Nice"" is about a group of girls getting together to tell their own stories. It has never been a better time to shine a light on a diverse, female ensemble taking charge of their own lives.  It's finally the moment for these princesses to rescue themselves...with a little help from their friends, some magic, and most importantly you!</p>
<h3>All we need is Faith, Trust, and a little Pixie Dust...</h3>
</div><div>

<h3>""It's kind of fun to do the impossible""-Walt Disney</h3>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Once Upon a Time...
There was a nerdy actress in Los Angeles who realized that her group of friends consisted almost exclusively of professional RPG players and professional princesses. How can you resist a mashup like that?

And here's the good news: We have scripts for 6 more episodes, a full season of Royal RPG (that's role-playing game) antics! And we've already filmed the pilot!  It's full of nerdy, silly shenanigans that we hope to release after the next two episodes are funded.

Here's where you come in, kind stranger/new best friend. We have everything ready to go, but filming a web series takes resources and we need all the help we can get!
All fundraising will go straight to offsetting the costs of production: Renting equipment, locations, paying our hardworking cast and crew, feeding, clothing, and wigging the princesses, dressing the set, etc. This project has been a labor of love by everyone involved, and we just need a little boost to share the full season with you! 
We've Got Gadgets and Gizmos Aplenty...


A shiny RED Camera! Professionally styled, custom wigs! Handmade props and costume pieces!
~We just need some help from our Fairy Godmothers to pay for them~
We were fortunate enough to be able to film the pilot ourselves, but we have 6 more episodes we would love to bring to life. This show means the world to us, and that means we want to make it the best that it can be. We want our princesses to shine!
With that in mind, each episode costs about $10,000 to make. That covers everything from the highest quality equipment and wigs, to competitive compensation for the cast and crew. Here's a breakdown of the expected budget for each episode: 


A Dream is a wish your heart makes...
And we have the power to make those dreams a reality!
At its heart, ""Damsels, Dice, and Everything Nice"" is about a group of girls getting together to tell their own stories. It has never been a better time to shine a light on a diverse, female ensemble taking charge of their own lives.  It's finally the moment for these princesses to rescue themselves...with a little help from their friends, some magic, and most importantly you!
All we need is Faith, Trust, and a little Pixie Dust...

Donations are delightful and you'll get some super fun perks as a backer for the series, but we understand if you're a little short on gold right now. 
If you can't give us the power of your dollars, please give us the power of your voice (If you haven't already sold it to a sea witch)!

<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">This is gonna' be big!</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><i>Vegan Round the World: The Series</i> is the world's first international vegan documentary series. Over the next six months, the Vegan Round the World (VRTW) team will be traveling to over ten countries and capturing inspiring stories from all across the vegan movement. We'll be compiling the footage into five exciting episodes, each covering a unique aspect of the vegan world as we know it!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The vegan movement is one of the fastest growing social justice movements on the planet and it comes at a pivotal time, as we desperately search for a way of living that will lessen our impact on the environment, promote worldwide health, and be kinder to the animals that we share this earth with. The VRTW team is here to inspire viewers by showing them the human side of the vegan movement, while also throwing in some beautiful imagery and comedic relief while we're at it. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Vegans should get excited because they're going to get to see all of their favorite faces up on the big screen (or whatever screen you've got, size isn't everything) such as Rawvana, Dr. Michael Greger, Mercy for Animals, Dr. Neal Barnard, Jon Venus, Animal Place Sanctuary, VegFest, Chocolate Covered Katie, Vegan Camp-Out UK, and so many more!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">And to all the non-vegans out there: don't worry! There will be plenty of fun for you too! This isn't a series about vegans for vegans. It's a series about vegans for everyone! If you've ever wondered how on earth they make ""vegan cheese"" or what exactly B12 is supposed to do, you've come to the right place!</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Let's be real for a second: the vegan movement doesn't exactly have the best image going for it.  Much of the general public is still under the impression that vegans are hippy weirdos who don't wear shoes. We're on a mission to show them that not only are we proud of our non-leather slippers, but that we're having a ton of fun making them too!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We know that to inspire change, we must first inspire. That's been our goal since day one and it will remain that way until the day we hang up our cameras.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Anyone can go on Netflix and watch any number of pro-vegan documentaries covering health, environmental impact, animal rights, etc. However, they'll all scare the socks right off of the viewer and some people just don't react well to that type of information. That's where <i>Vegan Round the World: The Series</i> comes in. We're here to show people the inspiring, human side of the vegan movement. We're here to show the world that this movement is made up of people from all backgrounds and professions and that it's certainly here to stay. </p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523678674/zd1g0t6j5upht1qu3qii.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">We've partnered with Trees for the Future, a non-profit organization that gives aid to impoverished rural families in Africa and gives them the resources and training to turn their land from infertile and barren to beautiful and filled with trees and crops! For every mile that we drive, fly, or hyperloop (we're waiting, Elon), we'll be making a donation to Trees for the Future to offset our carbon emissions by 100 percent! We will be tracking our monthly donations and sharing all of the juicy details with all of our VRTW Club Members!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">But that's not all! Every VRTW backer is also going to receive their very own tree certificate via email! We aren't even going to print them out on paper for you! Think about all of the trees we're saving!</p>

<h3>Well, let us explain:</h3>
<p>Filming a documentary isn't cheap. There are a lot of moving parts, different people for each job, and the equipment's price tag is enough to raise anyone's voice a few octaves. And if you think that sounds pricey, now just imagine that you're filming a multi-part documentary series and you've gotta drive/fly/Hyperloop (ELON COME ON!) around the globe! CHA-CHING!</p>
<p>But don't worry, our team is made up of efficient travelers that know how to do things on the cheap. </p>
<p>For example, on our recent East Coast US filming tour, we spent a whopping $0 on accommodation for 8 days. How? Well, we aren't exactly bashful. We sent out a V-blast (similar to the bat signal, but made out of broccoli) to all of our vegan people along our tourstops and they gave us a free place to stay! And we got to make new friends! How cool is that?!</p>
<p>So we've got accommodation taken care of '<i>round the world</i>, but we still need help with a few things:</p>

<p><strong>Where and when can I watch the series?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We plan to release the series on a major subscription platform by Spring 2019, but don’t worry, if you’re part of the VRTW backer’s club, you’ll get awesome behind the scenes footage from all around the world to keep you entertained in the meantime! And don’t forget, if you’re part of the backer’s club, you’re also going to get the pilot episode MONTHS before everyone else! How cool is that?!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>So what exactly is the VRTW Backer's Club?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Great Question! The VRTW Backer's Club gets you exclusive access to the behind the scenes as the VRTW team travels the world and meets amazing vegans from all around the globe. We'll be blasting out an email and video update monthly to all of our club members so that they can keep up with our progress and see all the amazing sights!</p>
<p><strong>How can I get involved?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">There are so many ways to get involved! First, come and meet us at one of the events we’re filming at! We’d love to see all of your shining faces (that whole lack of dairy thing must be good for the skin)! Tell your friends about us! Share this campaign! It’s as simple as hitting a button and it really does mean the world to us! And if you’re got an an amazing vegan story or company, shoot us a message and we’ll try and get you in the series!</p>
<p><strong>How many people will this reach?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We hope to reach a lot of people! We’re planning on an early 2019 release through a major subscription network while spending all of 2018 gaining a following and spreading the message about the series! We think that because we’re going to be traveling to so many countries over the next six months, we’ll be able to meet lots of people and get some serious hype going!</p>
<p><strong>How much does shipping cost for my sweet, 100% organic, water-based-ink t-shirt that’s made in a wind-powered factory?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Great question and thanks for being so specific! The price for shipping is a flat $5 for within the US, $10 in the EU, and $15 to Israel. Outside of those regions we’re unable to ship t-shirts, but feel free to check out some of our other perk options! If you're somewhere else in the world and really want a shirt (we don't blame you!) shoot us a DM on Instagram about wherabouts and we'll get you a quote!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Where can I stalk you?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Find us on Instagram! You can follow along @veganroundtheworldtheseries - We’re trying to keep the whole social media thing from taking over our lives completely, so we’re just sticking to the Instagram world for now, but we’re sure someone will “strongly advise” that we make a Facebook and Twitter later down the line. Until then, long live minimalism!!!</p>
<p><strong>When are you coming to Australia/Poland/South America/China/Abu Dhabi/Antarctica/etc?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Season one has come together so smoothly that we’d be more than happy to head to every destination on the planet to capture the amazing vegan stories within every region! As promised, if we hit our 200k bonus mark, you can count on a season two heading your way!</p>
<p><strong>When will the pilot episode be released to the members of the VRTW backers club?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We’ll have the VRTW Backers Club early-release episode out by March 2019, so you’ll get to see it before the rest of the world!</p>
<p><strong>Why so many colors?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">WE DRANK TOO MUCH COFFEE OKAY, RELAX</p>
<p><strong>Will the VRTW team get enough protein while they travel?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Please stop.</p>
<p><strong>What about B12?</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Seriously. Please stop.</p>

There are so many possibilities!
First off, thank you for your generosity! Even if you aren't able to make a monetary contribution, there are lots of ways that you can help support the series!

Follow us on Instagram!! You can find us @veganroundtheworldtheseries 
Share this campaign on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter! You can even Snapchat about it! Throw up some smoke signals! Do whatever you want! 
Tell your friends about the series! Every extra person that we can get behind this project will help spread the vegan movement further and faster!
Send us pictures of puppies! For real, that will make our day. 


From the bottom of all of our hearts here at Vegan Round the World: The Series, we want to sincerely thank each and every one of our backers, supporters, parents, siblings, flight attendants, vegan chefs, etc etc for being so kind and supportive. We couldn't have made it this far without you!
We're looking forward to seeing you all, well, 'Round the World. 

Where and when can I watch the series?
We plan to release the series on a major subscription platform by Spring 2019, but don’t worry, if you’re part of the VRTW backer’s club, you’ll get awesome behind the scenes footage from all around the world to keep you entertained in the meantime! And don’t forget, if you’re part of the backer’s club, you’re also going to get the pilot episode MONTHS before everyone else! How cool is that?!
So what exactly is the VRTW Backer's Club?
Great Question! The VRTW Backer's Club gets you exclusive access to the behind the scenes as the VRTW team travels the world and meets amazing vegans from all around the globe. We'll be blasting out an email and video update monthly to all of our club members so that they can keep up with our progress and see all the amazing sights!
How can I get involved?
There are so many ways to get involved! First, come and meet us at one of the events we’re filming at! We’d love to see all of your shining faces (that whole lack of dairy thing must be good for the skin)! Tell your friends about us! Share this campaign! It’s as simple as hitting a button and it really does mean the world to us! And if you’re got an an amazing vegan story or company, shoot us a message and we’ll try and get you in the series!
How many people will this reach?
We hope to reach a lot of people! We’re planning on an early 2019 release through a major subscription network while spending all of 2018 gaining a following and spreading the message about the series! We think that because we’re going to be traveling to so many countries over the next six months, we’ll be able to meet lots of people and get some serious hype going!
How much does shipping cost for my sweet, 100% organic, water-based-ink t-shirt that’s made in a wind-powered factory?
Great question and thanks for being so specific! The price for shipping is a flat $5 for within the US, $10 in the EU, and $15 to Israel. Outside of those regions we’re unable to ship t-shirts, but feel free to check out some of our other perk options! If you're somewhere else in the world and really want a shirt (we don't blame you!) shoot us a DM on Instagram about wherabouts and we'll get you a quote!
Where can I stalk you?
Find us on Instagram! You can follow along @veganroundtheworldtheseries - We’re trying to keep the whole social media thing from taking over our lives completely, so we’re just sticking to the Instagram world for now, but we’re sure someone will “strongly advise” that we make a Facebook and Twitter later down the line. Until then, long live minimalism!!!
When are you coming to Australia/Poland/South America/China/Abu Dhabi/Antarctica/etc?
Season one has come together so smoothly that we’d be more than happy to head to every destination on the planet to capture the amazing vegan stories within every region! As promised, if we hit our 200k bonus mark, you can count on a season two heading your way!
When will the pilot episode be released to the members of the VRTW backers club?
We’ll have the VRTW Backers Club early-release episode out by March 2019, so you’ll get to see it before the rest of the world!
Why so many colors?
WE DRANK TOO MUCH COFFEE OKAY, RELAX
Will the VRTW team get enough protein while they travel?
Please stop.
What about B12?

<ul>
<li>Furthering the diverse representation of artists in Chicago’s film industry: Over 90% of the roles in our pilot episode featured actors of color.

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every filmmaker undertakes an inherently expensive task to do this work well.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>When the business isn’t doing well, who saves the day? Are we at the mercy of those in charge? Or can we realize our power in those around us?</p>
<p>Our 10 episode comedy mini series hashes each side out as the staff of a struggling old town staple “Bangers”; clashes with a new duo of management know-it-alls determined to change everything for their dishonorable scheme. </p>
<p>Inspired equally by lives of real servers who double as film creatives, Gratuity Not Included aims to depict a victory of the bunch over the few – the battle we each wage in real life. Only in fiction can we guarantee the bunch a win – or at least give the few a burger to the face! </p>
<p>Shot in mockumentary style, Gratuity Not Included’s visual style deliberately evokes the feel of NBC’s Community, paying loving homage to the look of The Office and Parks and Recreation. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As humans, we live according to social rules that we've come to accept as the norm. But what if you came from a world where people lived in a completely different way? Where interactions and relationships were purely utilitarian, and showing emotion was frowned upon? What would you make of dating, friendship, and social conventions? That's exactly the situation our protagonist, Lex Kepler, finds herself in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alien explorer and scientist, Lex Kepler, comes from a very logical and science-oriented society. Xalax, her colleague, is creative and intuitive; basically the black sheep of their race, and the total opposite of Lex. The captain has assigned Lex and Xalax to study the human race from a sociological perspective, a subject matter that's totally out of Lex's element.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The aliens are enrolled in a university where they pretend to be brother and sister, and they cultivate friendships with several humans. In the beginning of the series, Lex and Xalax have a hard time working together. Lex views Xalax as an incompetent slacker, and Xalax feels that Lex is too stringent. As time goes on, they develop a deep bond. They go from pretending to be brother and sister to forming an emotional connection that's equivalent to a sibling relationship.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566795921/a9xmzcms4t1lgextm6sp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>My Human Experience</i> gives us an outsider's perspective on our society today and what it means to be human. Lex and Xalax learn about our society and the human condition (relationships, creativity, family, social media, pop culture, current trends, and friendship) -- and in the process, they remind the audience about the things that are truly important. Their misadventures are sure to make you laugh along the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a series that was created by two women, and one of our most important priorities is to give a voice to women (including women of color) and others with underrepresented perspectives. The show features a woman scientist as the lead character, and her human friend is a woman who is earning a graduate level degree in the sciences. Because women in STEM careers are still woefully underrepresented in popular media, we feel it's important to put female scientists front and center.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for $15,000, which is the minimum of what we need to be able to film the 1<sup>st</sup> episode. The funds go toward securing a talented cast &amp; crew (and feeding them during filming hours), quality costumes, set &amp; props, location and insurance costs, and any other filmmaking expenses that could arise. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every contribution and campaign share gets us closer to our dream of turning our sci-fi comedy script into a fun, and engaging digital series for you to watch!</p>
<p>We wrote this as something fun for us to do as friends, but after entering it into contests, sharing it with industry professionals, and seeing how well received it was, and how funny people found it, we were inspired to have it produced as an online series. The original script placed as a finalist (one of the top 10) in the Creative World Awards Contest, and has placed decently in several other contests such as Screencraft and WeScreenplay.</p>
<p>As mostly writers, we didn't feel we had the experience to direct it ourselves so we reached out to an accomplished, multi-award winning director, Jenn Page, who was enthusiastic about the script. She and her multi-award winning production team, Heart on Fire Productions, will take our script and make it into a professional looking digital series. We are elated to find such an exceptional team to work with! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks in filmmaking. In fact, taking creative risks is often a necessity if you want  a final product that will truly resonate with audiences. There are a lot of moving pieces with a film or, in our case, a web series. Everything from cast and crew to equipment, location, and food has to be coordinated in detail. But we've got a team that's great at organization and we're confident we will make this happen. All we need is the funding, so that all the awesome people on our team can do their thing.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
As humans, we live according to social rules that we've come to accept as the norm. But what if you came from a world where people lived in a completely different way? Where interactions and relationships were purely utilitarian, and showing emotion was frowned upon? What would you make of dating, friendship, and social conventions? That's exactly the situation our protagonist, Lex Kepler, finds herself in.
 
Alien explorer and scientist, Lex Kepler, comes from a very logical and science-oriented society. Xalax, her colleague, is creative and intuitive; basically the black sheep of their race, and the total opposite of Lex. The captain has assigned Lex and Xalax to study the human race from a sociological perspective, a subject matter that's totally out of Lex's element.  
 
The aliens are enrolled in a university where they pretend to be brother and sister, and they cultivate friendships with several humans. In the beginning of the series, Lex and Xalax have a hard time working together. Lex views Xalax as an incompetent slacker, and Xalax feels that Lex is too stringent. As time goes on, they develop a deep bond. They go from pretending to be brother and sister to forming an emotional connection that's equivalent to a sibling relationship.
 
                                             
 
My Human Experience gives us an outsider's perspective on our society today and what it means to be human. Lex and Xalax learn about our society and the human condition (relationships, creativity, family, social media, pop culture, current trends, and friendship) -- and in the process, they remind the audience about the things that are truly important. Their misadventures are sure to make you laugh along the way.
 
This is a series that was created by two women, and one of our most important priorities is to give a voice to women (including women of color) and others with underrepresented perspectives. The show features a woman scientist as the lead character, and her human friend is a woman who is earning a graduate level degree in the sciences. Because women in STEM careers are still woefully underrepresented in popular media, we feel it's important to put female scientists front and center.

<p><i>Little Roar and His Big Family</i> will be a webseries for preschool and young school aged children that follows the adventures of Little Roar, a five-year-old Tyrannosaurus Rex, his sister, Tiny Claw, and their two moms, Mommy and Mama Rex. Together, with a diverse cast of characters, the young dinosaurs will learn lessons about kindness and teamwork, as well as their ABC’s and 123’s.</p>
<p>Elaine Wall is the creator and a co-writer for the series. She and her wife are parents to a 3-year-old and 4-year-old.  When their kids were two, and songs like Baby Shark and Finger Family were the rage at story times around town, Elaine began to look around for nursery rhymes or children’s television or webseries that depicted families like their own to share with her kids, but found none.  And once she began to pay attention, she noticed that many other kinds of families, families through adoption or foster care, single parent or grandparent lead families, families with differently abled members, as well as LGBTQ+ families, were also hard to find. Soon after, the idea for<i> L</i><i><i>it</i>tle Roar and His Big Family</i> was born. Two T. rex siblings and their two moms; Grandpa Brachiosaurus and his grandson Olly; the Pterodactyl twins, Hank and Frank, and their single mom Ms. Dactyl; the Stegosauruses, Bruce and Judy, who live with their mom and dad, Sally and Bob Triceratops; as well as many others help demonstrate to young children that love and kindness is what makes a family great.</p>
<p>A group of artists have come together to produce the show with the help of Wolverine Farm Publishing, a 501c3 literary and arts nonprofit. They include artist Moby Donigian, animator and graphic artist Justin Maul, voice artist Hanna Doreen Brown, writer Melissa Mitchell, and the band Trash Cat, comprised of Brian and Mary Claxton and Hayden Farr.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Times are tough, the news is horrifying, and we are all in desperate need of fun and entertainment and unadulterated ridiculousness. Also people like space.</p>
<p>Burlesque kingpin Doc Wasabassco and science enthusiast Kat Green invite you to join us as we pull together our varied interests and Rolodex of fascinating human beings to create a talk show for the future age:  Outer Space with Doc Wasabassco. One part talk show, one part science fiction adventure, all parts absurd.</p>
<p>With your help we'll be able to produce a web series chronicling the adventures of the Captain and crew of the spaceship UAS Dorothy Fontana, 200 years into the future, and the beings and entertainers they encounter in the far reaches of the galaxy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the thing, we've already sunk a bunch of our own money and countless person-hours into building sets and models and and costumes, and we have a laundry list of people who's services we'll need to acquire to realize our objective. The final product is going to be free to view, so we're asking for upfront help to make this the best space-themed talk show we can.</p>
<p>We've designed our perks to get you involved, to make this show as much about you and your love of sci-fi and science and nonsense as about our own. We want you to be able to tell your friends you helped - or maybe appeared on - a science fiction web series.</p>
<p>We've set our goal at $10,000. That's going to reimburse us for what we've spent already and allow us to pay for the facilities, personnel, and equipment we need to create episodes of the show.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we'll still spend what funds we do raise on the show - we'll just use more duct tape to solve problems, less cool aliens and stuff, and we'll make fewer episodes. If we raise MORE than our goal, we'll use the funds for cooler stuff and to help pay the rent and feed ourselves.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Look, our mission here is to add a little joy to your life and ours, and to balance the grim news cycle with a little pure unadulterated fun - and we want to do it on a spaceship, because who doesn't love sci-fi stupidity? We're not saving the world here but we do want to entertain you and we promise to pull together everything our experience has taught us and to utilize everything we know to amuse you as much as we amuse ourselves. Sound good?</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that times are tough right now. If you're unable to financially contribute you can still assist us by helping getting the word out about this campaign! Share this campaign with your friends and followers using the Indiegogo share tools.

<p><u><strong>Logline:</strong></u></p>
<ul><li>Seven passionate partisans from both sides of the border and a dual-citizen moderator look for common ground by discussing issues from a 2LGBTQ+ perspective.</li></ul>
<p>         “CROSSOVER. Finding Common Ground. Discussing Common Sense.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></p>
<ul><li>The full acronym for the community is lengthy.  However, it is important to understand what each of the letters mean.  There has never been a formal acronym, as it constantly evolves and considerations like region and local understanding have played significant roles in determining the local acronyms that are used.  With that, some common forms of the acronym include:</li></ul>
<p>         2LGBTQQIAAP+</p>
<p>         2-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, ally, pansexual with the plus sign denoting “more” or “additional” as well as HIV Positive.  CROSSOVER will use 2LGBTQ+.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""> </p>
<p><u><strong>CONCEPT:</strong></u></p>
<ul><li>A combination political and current affairs show with Co-hosts representing diverse gender, racial and sexual identities (2LGBTQ+). Each Co-host represents, <strong>unofficially</strong>, a major political party in the United States or Canada. American Co-hosts represent the Republican Party, the Democratic Party and the Libertarian Party. Canadian Co-hosts represent the Conservative Party of Canada, the Green Party of Canada, the Liberal Party of Canada and Canada’s New Democratic Party.</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;""> </p>
<ul><li>There will be no official financial involvement or participation by any of the political parties; the moderator and co-hosts will maintain editorial control over the show’s content.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>PILOT EPISODE: A pilot episode of CROSSOVER will be filmed <strong>JANUARY 21, 2018</strong> at an Air Canada hangar at Toronto’s Pearson international Airport, with the anchor cast and moderator and will be available for review shortly after.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong>PHASE I</strong> will broadcast online each Sunday evening, twice filmed in each of the co-hosts respective cities, and twice each month filmed in the “on location” city outlined in the “Schedule” portion of this document.  The approximate length of each episode will be 40 minutes airing both online and on Air Canada's in-flight entertainment as well as other platforms to be announced.</li></ul>
<ul><li>PHASE II will broadcast 60-minutes using the same format as Phase I, except via live television broadcast as the primary medium.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<strong>PHASE I</strong> (ONLINE/AIR CANADA IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT) LAUNCH DATE: MARCH 25, 2018</li></ul>
<ul><li>PHASE II (BROADCAST TELEVISION) PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE: FALL 2019</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>TARGET AUDIENCE:</strong></u></p>
<ul><li>The target audience, while wholly inclusive of the 2LGBTQ+ community, will not exclude anyone.  The show will draw interest, viewership and support from multiple communities and individuals across North America, and likely from around the world.  Our confirmed partnership with Air Canada as the Canadian Air Carrier also brings a potentially larger mainstream audience through Air Canada’s in-flight entertainment, a medium also being sought with an American Air Carrier.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>OUR GOAL:</strong></u></p>
<p>CROSSOVER seeks to combine the cultural power of mass communication with the healing power of 2LGBTQ+ identities as an agent of social transformation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe that existing media narratives are not always complete, and that voices like ours have something relevant to offer in terms of a call for mutual respect and the unity that comes from prioritizing diversity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In other words, the world is filled with political partisans, and our aim is to show what it looks like when people are nice, or at least “politely sassy” as they cross-over multiple boundaries.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are many educational benefits that come from setting aside the partisan animosity traditionally seen as an impasse, without setting aside our shared, underlying motives for a peaceful, prosperous world and ideas for achieving them:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Increased understanding of Canadian and US politics by people of both nations</li>
<li>Restored public confidence in the electoral process as a vehicle for positive change</li>
<li>Facilitate meaningful electoral choices not driven by fear or character assassination</li>
<li>Respect for the relevance of 2LGBTQ+ voices to issues beyond gender &amp; sexual identity politics</li>
</ul>
<p>2LGBTQ+ people have historically been known as voices of healing and unity in our communities. Without trying to generalize, we can confidently say that our unique lived experiences provide a lens through which the value of finding common ground is seen as an opportunity for the famed creative spirit of our people to shine through opportunities including:</p>
<ul><li>“Crossing over” segments where partisans switch roles to defend and illuminate one another’s positions in unexpected ways</li></ul>
<ul><li>Introspective segments where partisans are offered space to critique areas for improvement within their own parties</li></ul>
<ul><li>Explanations and guided tours from Parliament Hill (Ottawa, Ontario) and Capitol Hill (Washington, DC), inviting viewers to learn with the Co-hosts about the governments of each nation, and episodes filmed in each of the Co-hosts respective cities.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Guest appearances by local activists, candidates and elected 2LGBTQ+ people from each nation</li></ul>
<ul><li>“Wholesome Family Discussion” segments where Co-hosts debate current, politically charged issues or scandals within the loving context of queer-culturally traditional “snark”</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>“Fake News Bulletin” segments where dubious material is examined and consensus regarding its veracity is reached</li>
<li>“Quiz Show” segments to present educational material in the form of entertainment</li>
<li>Audience participation through social media and contests to win a chance to appear on the show</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Leading by example, CROSSOVER hopes to set a tone of mutual respect and camaraderie across partisan and international boundaries, helping to pave the way for a global spirit of peaceful dialogue to benefit everyone on the planet.  </u><strong><u>The tone of CROSSOVER will, in many ways, be opposite to most pundit shows</u></strong><strong><u>.</u></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While certain elements of our program, as currently planned, may not strictly fall within existing media funding categories, in our view, CROSSOVER broadly complies with the <i>spirit </i>of many funding criteria in that:</p>
<ol><li>One of our two co-producers is a Canadian citizen, and the other an American citizen, each holding an integral part in determining what content will appear on the show.  Our Canadian Co-Producer, as does the U.S. Cp-Producer, hold veto over content proposed by others, and is prepared to use his power to exclude any content that would devalue the production for either country, or otherwise run counter to the ideals behind most major funder’s policies.</li></ol>
<p style=""margin-left:.75in;""> </p>
<ol><li value=""2"">CROSSOVER’s American Co-Producer has visited Canada more than two dozen times over the past fourteen years and has researched and published papers on Canadian politics and shares in a commitment that the Canadian nature of our production be preserved and highlighted, often a disadvantage many Canadian productions encounter.</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<ol><li value=""3"">In each and every episode, five of CROSSOVER’s eight cast members (including our dual-citizen moderator) are Canadian citizens.  Of the remaining three, one regularly appears on Canadian television (on networks such as the CBC), and the other two share the vision that the show’s content reflect all of the markings of a cross-border production.</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<ol><li value=""4"">While points of view will inevitably be expressed in CROSSOVER’s exploration and discussion of Canadian issues, no <i>single</i> point of view will be assigned a higher importance or level of validity over another (though all content presented will have a factual basis), due to the representation of all of Canada’s political parties.  This falls in line with a core mission of the show, which is to educate holistically about Canadian issues, and not to propagandize.</li></ol>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;""> </p>

</div></div>","Logline:
Seven passionate partisans from both sides of the border and a dual-citizen moderator look for common ground by discussing issues from a 2LGBTQ+ perspective.
         “CROSSOVER. Finding Common Ground. Discussing Common Sense.”
 
BACKGROUND:
The full acronym for the community is lengthy.  However, it is important to understand what each of the letters mean.  There has never been a formal acronym, as it constantly evolves and considerations like region and local understanding have played significant roles in determining the local acronyms that are used.  With that, some common forms of the acronym include:
         2LGBTQQIAAP+
         2-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, ally, pansexual with the plus sign denoting “more” or “additional” as well as HIV Positive.  CROSSOVER will use 2LGBTQ+.
 
CONCEPT:
A combination political and current affairs show with Co-hosts representing diverse gender, racial and sexual identities (2LGBTQ+). Each Co-host represents, unofficially, a major political party in the United States or Canada. American Co-hosts represent the Republican Party, the Democratic Party and the Libertarian Party. Canadian Co-hosts represent the Conservative Party of Canada, the Green Party of Canada, the Liberal Party of Canada and Canada’s New Democratic Party.
 
There will be no official financial involvement or participation by any of the political parties; the moderator and co-hosts will maintain editorial control over the show’s content.
 
PILOT EPISODE: A pilot episode of CROSSOVER will be filmed JANUARY 21, 2018 at an Air Canada hangar at Toronto’s Pearson international Airport, with the anchor cast and moderator and will be available for review shortly after.
 

PHASE I will broadcast online each Sunday evening, twice filmed in each of the co-hosts respective cities, and twice each month filmed in the “on location” city outlined in the “Schedule” portion of this document.  The approximate length of each episode will be 40 minutes airing both online and on Air Canada's in-flight entertainment as well as other platforms to be announced.
PHASE II will broadcast 60-minutes using the same format as Phase I, except via live television broadcast as the primary medium.

PHASE I (ONLINE/AIR CANADA IN-FLIGHT ENTERTAINMENT) LAUNCH DATE: MARCH 25, 2018
PHASE II (BROADCAST TELEVISION) PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE: FALL 2019
 
TARGET AUDIENCE:
The target audience, while wholly inclusive of the 2LGBTQ+ community, will not exclude anyone.  The show will draw interest, viewership and support from multiple communities and individuals across North America, and likely from around the world.  Our confirmed partnership with Air Canada as the Canadian Air Carrier also brings a potentially larger mainstream audience through Air Canada’s in-flight entertainment, a medium also being sought with an American Air Carrier.
 
OUR GOAL:
CROSSOVER seeks to combine the cultural power of mass communication with the healing power of 2LGBTQ+ identities as an agent of social transformation.
 
We believe that existing media narratives are not always complete, and that voices like ours have something relevant to offer in terms of a call for mutual respect and the unity that comes from prioritizing diversity.
 
In other words, the world is filled with political partisans, and our aim is to show what it looks like when people are nice, or at least “politely sassy” as they cross-over multiple boundaries.
 
There are many educational benefits that come from setting aside the partisan animosity traditionally seen as an impasse, without setting aside our shared, underlying motives for a peaceful, prosperous world and ideas for achieving them:
 

Increased understanding of Canadian and US politics by people of both nations
Restored public confidence in the electoral process as a vehicle for positive change
Facilitate meaningful electoral choices not driven by fear or character assassination
Respect for the relevance of 2LGBTQ+ voices to issues beyond gender & sexual identity politics

2LGBTQ+ people have historically been known as voices of healing and unity in our communities. Without trying to generalize, we can confidently say that our unique lived experiences provide a lens through which the value of finding common ground is seen as an opportunity for the famed creative spirit of our people to shine through opportunities including:
“Crossing over” segments where partisans switch roles to defend and illuminate one another’s positions in unexpected ways
Introspective segments where partisans are offered space to critique areas for improvement within their own parties
Explanations and guided tours from Parliament Hill (Ottawa, Ontario) and Capitol Hill (Washington, DC), inviting viewers to learn with the Co-hosts about the governments of each nation, and episodes filmed in each of the Co-hosts respective cities.
Guest appearances by local activists, candidates and elected 2LGBTQ+ people from each nation
“Wholesome Family Discussion” segments where Co-hosts debate current, politically charged issues or scandals within the loving context of queer-culturally traditional “snark”

“Fake News Bulletin” segments where dubious material is examined and consensus regarding its veracity is reached
“Quiz Show” segments to present educational material in the form of entertainment
Audience participation through social media and contests to win a chance to appear on the show

Leading by example, CROSSOVER hopes to set a tone of mutual respect and camaraderie across partisan and international boundaries, helping to pave the way for a global spirit of peaceful dialogue to benefit everyone on the planet.  The tone of CROSSOVER will, in many ways, be opposite to most pundit shows.
 
While certain elements of our program, as currently planned, may not strictly fall within existing media funding categories, in our view, CROSSOVER broadly complies with the spirit of many funding criteria in that:
One of our two co-producers is a Canadian citizen, and the other an American citizen, each holding an integral part in determining what content will appear on the show.  Our Canadian Co-Producer, as does the U.S. Cp-Producer, hold veto over content proposed by others, and is prepared to use his power to exclude any content that would devalue the production for either country, or otherwise run counter to the ideals behind most major funder’s policies.
 
CROSSOVER’s American Co-Producer has visited Canada more than two dozen times over the past fourteen years and has researched and published papers on Canadian politics and shares in a commitment that the Canadian nature of our production be preserved and highlighted, often a disadvantage many Canadian productions encounter.
 
In each and every episode, five of CROSSOVER’s eight cast members (including our dual-citizen moderator) are Canadian citizens.  Of the remaining three, one regularly appears on Canadian television (on networks such as the CBC), and the other two share the vision that the show’s content reflect all of the markings of a cross-border production.
 
While points of view will inevitably be expressed in CROSSOVER’s exploration and discussion of Canadian issues, no single point of view will be assigned a higher importance or level of validity over another (though all content presented will have a factual basis), due to the representation of all of Canada’s political parties.  This falls in line with a core mission of the show, which is to educate holistically about Canadian issues, and not to propagandize.
 
Moreover, the bi-national nature of CROSSOVER makes us better positioned to promote the spirit of the major funding policies than a traditional, strictly “Canada-only” production would, in the following respects:
 
Content related to the United States, bearing high salience around the world, will be presented, but done mostly by Canadians (in partnership with their American co-hosts) and with a Canadian perspective; coverage of U.S. and world events with a Canadian “twist” is currently available nowhere else outside of the domestic Canadian market.  The existence of a show like CROSSOVER changes this unfortunate reality.
 
U.S.-based content will be presented to our audience alongside our Canadian content, giving the large U.S. viewer base immediate access to information and educational material on Canada, and over the long term, will promote interest and commerce in, and affinity for, Canada among U.S. viewers.  Exposure to Canadian culture and perspectives for U.S. viewers will be facilitated throughout.
 
The broadcast medium chosen for CROSSOVER enables our cast to reach a worldwide audience, who in turn, will also be introduced to Canadian perspectives on issues important to them and in ways that may not reach these audiences who are often inundated with broadcasts from the United States
 
DRAFT CONTENT/SHOW TOPICS:
 
Similar to high-school debate club, Co-hosts will express their views as they relate to their respective parties on issues/topics, but also each episode will have two Co-hosts (varied by episode) who will defend the other Co-hosts position in a “crossing over” segment.
 
Co-hosts will be asked to provide critiques of their own party, ways to make their party better in the direction they would like or believe their party should be taking on different issues.
 
Two episodes will include explanations and guided tours from Parliament Hill and Capitol Hill representatives of the respective legislative buildings, and electoral explanations, including explanation of things like swing states and ridings
 
2LGBTQ+ and allies/elected Legislators will join the show, including US and Canadian Ambassadors
 
The political “Coattails” between Canada and the United States
 
“So What?” segment – how does the issue we are talking about relate to the 2LGBTQ+ community?
 
1-minute pre-taped, cohost monologue (Rants-Rick Mercer style) https://youtu.be/gFgPX0hnNfA

 
Interviews with local 2LGBTQ+ individuals in various co-hosts districts
 
Invite viewers, including rural, to comment by social media including tweet, skype, email etc…
 
""Wholesome Family Discussion” For each filming, the show identifies either a salient, politically- charged issue for which differences are irreconcilable (abortion, gun control), discussing a recent news story on the topic, or an instance of scandal (Mueller probe, sexual misconduct e.g. Larry Craig's foot-tapping, Weinergate), a controversial tweet or other tabloid-style issue that elicits a s, strong response.  All Co-hosts (and guests, if present) contribute in one 3-minute moderated block.  This may be the least ""serious"" segment; if any mudslinging does occur, it will likely be here.

<h3>Why Support This Project?</h3>
<p>This web series is created by emerging film artists, writers, illustrators, photographers, and aims to engage with a diverse audience. Your donations support up-and-coming Canadian artists and a story focused on not only making you laugh (our number one goal is to make you laugh) but also a story that touches on contemporary issues of inequality, social structures, politics, race and sexuality all with a funny twist that is meant to be self-aware and reflexive. Further, our intention for this pilot episode is to pitch the comedy series at the 2018 Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal. We want to continue making this show, but we need your help to get it started!</p>

<p>I have always been into warm, cozy turtleneck sweaters. Donning the turtleneck first as a young adolescent, this is when I first began to realize that the suffocating nature of the turtleneck was a minor inconvenience in return for the encompassing warmth that such a garment can provide in retaliation against cold Canadian winters. Now, in my early twenties, I am fully committed to bringing audiences the same love and affection I have for the turtleneck sweater to this web series and the variety of quirky, emotional and off-the-wall characters that I hope you guys fall in love with.</p>
<p>I graduated from Queen’s University Film and Media department. This is also where I met a majority of this incredible team behind Turtleneck.</p>
<h3>Eric Tisch (aka Andy) – Writer/Actor </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519889476/v7xryx4unh6xcfhwagxj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My life motto is the fairly common idiom “You are what you eat”. I interpret this as an instruction to only consume the finest works of art to ensure that my creative excretions are supreme art works themselves. I am thrilled that I was given the opportunity to chronicle my experiences as a part of this society as one of the writers on the series, and I have sought to conduct my pen in a fashionable manner that behooves the memories it details. I was also given the opportunity to portray myself in the series, a privilege I do not take lightly. As an actor, I chew only the finest of scenery, which is why this project with its particularly delicious setting is so obviously appealing. I treat this endeavour not only as a reflection of myself, but equally of the carefully chosen diet that has crossed my perfectionist palette. Thanks to the efforts of the cast and crew to bring my stories to life, I feel confident that you will be enraptured and enlightened</p>
<h3>Fenton Isaacs - Director of Photography </h3>

<p>I'm Fenton and I will be the cinematographer for <i>The Turtleneck Society Web Series</i>. I'm excited to capture the elegance, the grace and the beauty of these characters in a picturesque way. Not only am I excited about making this series look great but I'm also stoked to work on the comedy aspect. How to translate the humour in the script and onto the screen and how to shoot this in a way that reflects the prestige of the club and how they wish others to see them but also who they <i>really </i>are at their core which is superficial, insecure, ridiculous and flawed. </p>
<h3>Jordana Green - Production Designer/Illustrator</h3>

<p>Jordana’s ideal turtleneck would be one that can be worn while consuming copious amounts of coffee. Its colour would match, or at the very least complement the colour in an artistic way. When at Queen’s University, the lack of properly coordinated coffee-clothing combinations concerned her. Being in the art department of <i>The Turtleneck Society</i> as production designer is a far more comfortable position in this respect, and the lack of appalling exposed necks is just a bonus.</p>
<h3>Danielle Bolick - Lead Animator/Illustrator </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519889889/fvrmbaaixqkgfgmxhnqu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Every time I wear a turtleneck, it feels like a noose is tightening just a little more around my neck; thereby bringing me closer to death. As a masochistic individual, that sweet and deadly embrace comforts me.</p>
<p>As an animator I wanna be famous, but like how voice actors or authors are famous. I wanna be able to go to conventions and sign stuff and meet people that are way cooler than me but somehow like my work and feel famous but then drive out to Robertitos taco shop for lunch in my Nissan Cube and not have anybody recognize me as I scarf down my chicken burrito and spill hot sauce on my shirt. Animating for <i>The Turtleneck Society</i>, and bringing these characters to life, gave me absolute joy. It was the closest thing I could be to being in front of the camera without having to actually be in front of the camera. Also the free wine was some good quality stuff. Thanks y’all!</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Jason Fung, and I am in charge of music for <i>The Turtleneck Web Series</i>. The decision to record a soundtrack of entirely classical music for piano has been an interesting challenge for me. One wants to find something that will ironically embody the 'hoity-toitiness' of the club, yet provide a pleasant and varied listening experience with the inclusion of a few 'not-quite-so-popular favorites'. This has all been a terrifically fun experience for me, and I hope you will find the series to your liking.</p>

<p>Dear Maria,</p>
<p>As you embark on the journey of being Unit Publicist on <i>The Turtleneck Society</i>, you should remember the experiences you’ve encountered in this great journey of life. Be it as a graduate from Queen’s University, a socials Guru at Wax, or that time you spilled the sunflower oil and had to settle for tequila. You have matured like a fine wine, and now it is time to savour the oaky undertones that you have imbued into your position.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Maria from the future</p>

<p>Existential dread is a humorous thing -- one day your mind screams ""AHHHHHH!"" and the next it barely musters an ""aHhHhHhHh?"" When I'm not drowning in the pain of existence I drown instead on the finest of wines. Not out of desire to escape the pain, you understand, but because I genuinely don't like wine. The bitter taste makes my lips tense up and frown involuntarily and in turn furthers my own bitterness towards the world. Why did I pay $80 for this high-class drink I don't even enjoy? I drink the wine out of self-loathing. Haha, just kidding! That was just a bit of a taste of my poetry. I'm really quite a happy person. I play a fellow with some slammin' poetry: the president of the Turtleneck Society. Grab some wine and enjoy. Or don't, the void is indifferent.</p>
<h3>Jackson Fielding - Søren von Sørenson, <i>Cultural Attaché</i>

<p>A turtleneck was never something I enjoyed nor sought in my life. Clunky, itchy and often too warm, I made a conscious choice throughout my young life to avoid, shun and on occasions lambaste. It wasn't until I was forcibly gifted a turtleneck that I begrudgingly began to wear them. And while now, three years later, much of that original scorn remains, I put up with it because that's what an artist does. And yes, I am an artist. Not in the literal sense, but the metaphorical. I learnt what 'metaphorical' meant at Queen's university where I went to school and where this whole turtleneck trouble began. And here we are now, making something explicitly centered around the turtleneck top. That's okay, I suppose.</p>

<p>Alexandra Lloyd, playing the role of Lizzie, could not be more excited to be a part of such a wonderful project! As someone living on a university student’s budget, Alexandra is looking forward to portraying a character who is a true bougie-ass b*tch. In addition for her passion for the arts, Alexandra loves ranting about the cisheteropatriarchy and using the third person to discuss herself. Alexandra currently resides in one of the indistinguishably hellish towns of Southern Ontario.</p>

<p>The art of performance is a medium I'm constantly trying to find new ways to grow in. It's something as old as mankind, and as a history fan you can see how character tropes overlap each other throughout the ages. It's something that informs even a ridiculous character like Randy, who is all too relatable in today's world which glorifies sleeze</p>

<p>On the topic of ""who is Jared Aronoff?"" it is absolutely imperative that one include the name Toby-Keith in conversation, as there is no Jared Aronoff without Toby-Keith.

This web series is created by emerging film artists, writers, illustrators, photographers, and aims to engage with a diverse audience. Your donations support up-and-coming Canadian artists and a story focused on not only making you laugh (our number one goal is to make you laugh) but also a story that touches on contemporary issues of inequality, social structures, politics, race and sexuality all with a funny twist that is meant to be self-aware and reflexive. Further, our intention for this pilot episode is to pitch the comedy series at the 2018 Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal. We want to continue making this show, but we need your help to get it started!
Meet The Turtleneck Creative & Production Team!
Samantha Rousseau - Creator and Director

I have always been into warm, cozy turtleneck sweaters. Donning the turtleneck first as a young adolescent, this is when I first began to realize that the suffocating nature of the turtleneck was a minor inconvenience in return for the encompassing warmth that such a garment can provide in retaliation against cold Canadian winters. Now, in my early twenties, I am fully committed to bringing audiences the same love and affection I have for the turtleneck sweater to this web series and the variety of quirky, emotional and off-the-wall characters that I hope you guys fall in love with.
I graduated from Queen’s University Film and Media department. This is also where I met a majority of this incredible team behind Turtleneck.
Eric Tisch (aka Andy) – Writer/Actor 

My life motto is the fairly common idiom “You are what you eat”. I interpret this as an instruction to only consume the finest works of art to ensure that my creative excretions are supreme art works themselves. I am thrilled that I was given the opportunity to chronicle my experiences as a part of this society as one of the writers on the series, and I have sought to conduct my pen in a fashionable manner that behooves the memories it details. I was also given the opportunity to portray myself in the series, a privilege I do not take lightly. As an actor, I chew only the finest of scenery, which is why this project with its particularly delicious setting is so obviously appealing. I treat this endeavour not only as a reflection of myself, but equally of the carefully chosen diet that has crossed my perfectionist palette. Thanks to the efforts of the cast and crew to bring my stories to life, I feel confident that you will be enraptured and enlightened
Fenton Isaacs - Director of Photography 

I'm Fenton and I will be the cinematographer for The Turtleneck Society Web Series. I'm excited to capture the elegance, the grace and the beauty of these characters in a picturesque way. Not only am I excited about making this series look great but I'm also stoked to work on the comedy aspect. How to translate the humour in the script and onto the screen and how to shoot this in a way that reflects the prestige of the club and how they wish others to see them but also who they really are at their core which is superficial, insecure, ridiculous and flawed. 
Jordana Green - Production Designer/Illustrator

Jordana’s ideal turtleneck would be one that can be worn while consuming copious amounts of coffee. Its colour would match, or at the very least complement the colour in an artistic way. When at Queen’s University, the lack of properly coordinated coffee-clothing combinations concerned her. Being in the art department of The Turtleneck Society as production designer is a far more comfortable position in this respect, and the lack of appalling exposed necks is just a bonus.
Danielle Bolick - Lead Animator/Illustrator 

Every time I wear a turtleneck, it feels like a noose is tightening just a little more around my neck; thereby bringing me closer to death. As a masochistic individual, that sweet and deadly embrace comforts me.
As an animator I wanna be famous, but like how voice actors or authors are famous. I wanna be able to go to conventions and sign stuff and meet people that are way cooler than me but somehow like my work and feel famous but then drive out to Robertitos taco shop for lunch in my Nissan Cube and not have anybody recognize me as I scarf down my chicken burrito and spill hot sauce on my shirt. Animating for The Turtleneck Society, and bringing these characters to life, gave me absolute joy. It was the closest thing I could be to being in front of the camera without having to actually be in front of the camera. Also the free wine was some good quality stuff. Thanks y’all!
Jason Fung - Music Supervisor 

Hello! My name is Jason Fung, and I am in charge of music for The Turtleneck Web Series. The decision to record a soundtrack of entirely classical music for piano has been an interesting challenge for me. One wants to find something that will ironically embody the 'hoity-toitiness' of the club, yet provide a pleasant and varied listening experience with the inclusion of a few 'not-quite-so-popular favorites'. This has all been a terrifically fun experience for me, and I hope you will find the series to your liking.
Maria Vlasova - Unit Publicist 

Dear Maria,
As you embark on the journey of being Unit Publicist on The Turtleneck Society, you should remember the experiences you’ve encountered in this great journey of life. Be it as a graduate from Queen’s University, a socials Guru at Wax, or that time you spilled the sunflower oil and had to settle for tequila. You have matured like a fine wine, and now it is time to savour the oaky undertones that you have imbued into your position.
Sincerely,
Maria from the future
Meet the (real life) Turtleneck Society
Gregory Guevara - Alain Improviste,The President 


Existential dread is a humorous thing -- one day your mind screams ""AHHHHHH!"" and the next it barely musters an ""aHhHhHhHh?"" When I'm not drowning in the pain of existence I drown instead on the finest of wines. Not out of desire to escape the pain, you understand, but because I genuinely don't like wine. The bitter taste makes my lips tense up and frown involuntarily and in turn furthers my own bitterness towards the world. Why did I pay $80 for this high-class drink I don't even enjoy? I drink the wine out of self-loathing. Haha, just kidding! That was just a bit of a taste of my poetry. I'm really quite a happy person. I play a fellow with some slammin' poetry: the president of the Turtleneck Society. Grab some wine and enjoy. Or don't, the void is indifferent.
Jackson Fielding - Søren von Sørenson, Cultural Attaché


A turtleneck was never something I enjoyed nor sought in my life. Clunky, itchy and often too warm, I made a conscious choice throughout my young life to avoid, shun and on occasions lambaste. It wasn't until I was forcibly gifted a turtleneck that I begrudgingly began to wear them. And while now, three years later, much of that original scorn remains, I put up with it because that's what an artist does. And yes, I am an artist. Not in the literal sense, but the metaphorical. I learnt what 'metaphorical' meant at Queen's university where I went to school and where this whole turtleneck trouble began. And here we are now, making something explicitly centered around the turtleneck top. That's okay, I suppose.
Alexandra Lloyd - Elizabeth ""Lizzie"", Club Photographer 

Alexandra Lloyd, playing the role of Lizzie, could not be more excited to be a part of such a wonderful project! As someone living on a university student’s budget, Alexandra is looking forward to portraying a character who is a true bougie-ass b*tch. In addition for her passion for the arts, Alexandra loves ranting about the cisheteropatriarchy and using the third person to discuss herself. Alexandra currently resides in one of the indistinguishably hellish towns of Southern Ontario.
Joey Cifala - Randall ""Randy"", Club Sleazebag 

The art of performance is a medium I'm constantly trying to find new ways to grow in. It's something as old as mankind, and as a history fan you can see how character tropes overlap each other throughout the ages. It's something that informs even a ridiculous character like Randy, who is all too relatable in today's world which glorifies sleeze
Christian Milanovic - Crispin, Club Prankster 

Christian enjoys pretending to do things. So we filmed him and everything worked well from there.
Jared Aronoff (also the First Assistant Director and Script Editor) - Toby-Keith, Unknown


On the topic of ""who is Jared Aronoff?"" it is absolutely imperative that one include the name Toby-Keith in conversation, as there is no Jared Aronoff without Toby-Keith. Vice versa, however, is not the same. Toby-Keith, in question, is an indescribable, divine essence, that transcends this very realm. His very Being is a force that, if we must describe for describings sake, is best described as a phenomenon. Toby-Keith is an experience, a phenomenon, that is best honoured in the very flesh that is reality. Note: should you ever have the pleasure of engaging with Toby-Keith in person we plead you not to question why he never takes off his leather gloves.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>All 6 episodes of The Bachelor: Princess Edition mini-series are in the can and YOU got it there. We can't thank you enough for getting us through Pre-Production and Production. With the funds from our first Indiegogo we were able to film in a beautiful location fit for a Prince Bachelor, cast Princess contestants with stunning Disneybound outfits, hire the best possible crew to get us through all 6 episodes in only 2 short days at the mansion, purchase insurance needed for the location, feed the cast/crew, and provide all the lights, filming equipment, sound recording equipment, props, make-up, set dec, and costume changes needed. </p>
<p>Even though our footage looks AMAZING (seriously, we could not be more ecstatic with the footage), it's not ready to be released yet. We didn't raise all of the money we needed to complete the project in our first Indiegogo, so we need your help again to get it through Post Production and onto YouTube. We were $2,000 shy of our goal the first time around and that was delegated to the budget for Post Production. Read on to find out what that entails. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Now that we have all the gorgeous footage from filming, we need to be able to put it together in a way that will highlight the high production value we always strive for in our parody videos. We are able to edit a rough cut of the footage together ourselves; however, we need to pay others to use their unique skills and equipment to make it look and sound professional. In order for you as the viewer to be sucked in and not distracted by the harsh cuts between scenes, we will have a <strong>COMPOSER</strong> provide special transition music as well as sound effects that you would expect on a cheesy reality show. He will also <strong>MIX THE SOUND</strong> of characters’ voices so that there are no dramatic shifts in volume or tone, which can sometimes happen when cutting together shots that were filmed in different rooms with completely different acoustics. Also, since we filmed this series on two separate cameras (which is a glorious thing, we must say!), the coloring of each shot is going to look pretty different. We will need to spend a small chunk of this goal on having someone <strong>COLOR CORRECT THE FOOTAGE</strong> so that the color matches in each scene.</p>

<p>The last thing we need to account for is <strong>ADVERTISING</strong> this web series. While it is always a huge help to have backers and friends share our projects on social media, it is essential for us to be able to promote to more far-reaching audiences in order to get the views we think this deserves. We want all the dedication and hard work that every cast and crew member put into this production to be recognized all over the world, which is very possible already through YouTube. We just need that extra push from paid advertisements and press releases to get more viewers who haven’t yet discovered our channel.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Episode One (Pilot) - <strong>“Invasion”</strong><br/>Invasion is happening.  From what?  No one knows for sure at first.  Tony, Ashley, and Mikayla join Adam and Laura at Adam’s house.  At first, there are various news reports from around the country.  Reports of mysterious Men In Black appearing out of nowhere and snatching up loved ones.  Our small group thinks they're safe.  That is until one of those Men In Black shows up on their doorstep.  Ruthless and methodical it will stop at nothing until it achieves its objective.  What is the objective?   You'll have to contribute to our <strong>ENCOUNTER</strong> campaign to find out. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h2>
<p><i>Seeking Refuge </i>is a four-episode digital series exploring the lives of four female refugees living in the city of Toronto.<i> </i>Inspired by M. Émeraude Domingos-Mbuku's documentary,<i> It's a Little Complicated</i>, which focused on her mother's journey to Scarborough, Ontario, Canada from Kinshasa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaïre), <i>Seeking</i> <i>Refuge </i>aims to emphasize female immigrants, migrants, and refugees and create a space for them to tell their stories in their own words. In sitting down with these women and giving them a platform to talk about their experiences, we are giving them an opportunity to teach Canadian citizens about the immigration/refugee process and open doors for honest dialogue. Women have always been a viable source of information. As of late, it has become commonplace for women to remain silent when talking about themselves or the traumas they have endured. We are looking to connect people through poignant storytelling.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Once upon a time some friends thought it would be fun to film a cooking show, so they did. It was so much fun that they want to do it some more. The idea is for hosts Donnie Price and Paula Reynolds to welcome a different artist every episode. Singers, songwriters, musicians- they all have recipes to share and stories to tell. Director/Executive Producer Taylor Price has assembled a team of some of Texas' most talented professionals to assure that those sights and sounds are presented in the highest quality, and many of your favorite artists are excited to get in the kitchen with us.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are crowdfunding for the final goal of $25,000 to shoot at least three episodes of <i>Texas Cookin'</i>  to edit down into a sizzle reel to send to networks and perspective sponsors.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500421790/wyoodchhaccai1pvfpik.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With these funds we will hire a crew of professionals and acquire the best equipment possible to showcase the talented musical guests, and also procure the rights to the songs performed each episode. Also, we will pay for studio and artist fees to re-cut the <i>Texas Cookin'</i>  theme song with some of Texas' best musicians; including a few Grammy winners. On top of that we will cover the costs for food and wine each episode as well as paying our talented guest artists for their time.</p>
<p> </p>

Once upon a time some friends thought it would be fun to film a cooking show, so they did. It was so much fun that they want to do it some more. The idea is for hosts Donnie Price and Paula Reynolds to welcome a different artist every episode. Singers, songwriters, musicians- they all have recipes to share and stories to tell. Director/Executive Producer Taylor Price has assembled a team of some of Texas' most talented professionals to assure that those sights and sounds are presented in the highest quality, and many of your favorite artists are excited to get in the kitchen with us.
 

What We Need
We are crowdfunding for the final goal of $25,000 to shoot at least three episodes of Texas Cookin'  to edit down into a sizzle reel to send to networks and perspective sponsors.
Here is the breakdown:

With these funds we will hire a crew of professionals and acquire the best equipment possible to showcase the talented musical guests, and also procure the rights to the songs performed each episode. Also, we will pay for studio and artist fees to re-cut the Texas Cookin'  theme song with some of Texas' best musicians; including a few Grammy winners. On top of that we will cover the costs for food and wine each episode as well as paying our talented guest artists for their time.
 
Meet the Team

<h3>Major Update:</h3>
<p>May 10, 2017: We have an Angel Investor and are so thankful. Outside of this campaign platform, a very generous investor has commited to funding two episodes. Filming will take place in late June and we are already moving into pre-production. But we still need your help. We need to fund one more episode. If we get more than needed for the third episode, we can move into filming episodes 4, 5 and 6. </p>

<p><strong>Get Onboard! </strong>This fundraiser is about helping this timely show that puts women in roles which portray them as strong, independent characters, on the airways.</p>
<p>The concept for the show comes from actress <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1683409/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nicole Criss</a> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2901516/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A HORSE FOR SUMMER</a>) and the screenplay and story is award-winning actress <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3796165/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mandalynn Carlson</a> (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4668450/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GREY'S ANATOMY</a>). Their goal was to work on a woman-centric project ▬ one created by, written, produced, directed and distributed by women.</p>

<ol>
<li>In 2014, 85% of films had no female directors, 80% had no female writers, 33% had no female producers, 78% had no female editors and 92% had no female cinematographers.</li>
<li>Women comprised 13% of directors on the top 700 films, but just 7% on the top 250 films.</li>
<li>Women made up 13% of writers on the top 700 films, and 11% on the top 250 films.</li>
<li>Women made up 27% of producers on the top 700 films, while 23% on the top 250 films were female.</li>
<li>Women accounted for 9% of cinematographers on the top 700 films, but 5% of cinematographers on the top 250 pictures.</li>
<li>The number of female editors stayed consistent at 18% in both test samples.</li>
</ol>
<p>Evidence suggests that women in positions of power are more likely to employ other women. The study also suggests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Films with female directors, women comprised 52% of writers, 35% of editors and 26% of cinematographers. When men directed, the number of female writers shrank to 8%, editors fell to 15% and cinematographers dropped to 5%.</li>
<li>The same is true for directing opportunities. Women comprised 20% of directors on projects where at least a third of the producers were female, but just 7% of directors when the representation of female producers fell below that percentage.</li>

<p><strong>ABOUT US</strong>: <strong><u>Nandar Pictures LLC is a family of filmmakers in a variety of genres.</u></strong> Our first series, a single cam comedy is being looked at by Netflix and has already been funded.  ""A BLIND EYE"" will be our first drama series and our goal is to fund, create and air in time for Daytime Emmy nominations.</p>
<p><strong><u>Our Goal:</u></strong> Six episodes for the first phase,  with a total of 18 episodes for a complete season. Having enough episodes available, creates an opportunity for people to binge watch, like what they see and ask for more. This also allows us to take a successful ""showing"" in the marketplace to the online platform leaders like Amazon, NetFlix, Hulu and pitch the show as one of their original shows.</p>

While Mandalynn waits, she continues to train with some of the best coaches in Hollywood and she is creating projects. Just like Sylvester Stalone and many others, she has taken to creating opportunities for work in Hollywood, in front and behind the camera. ""Sometimes you create while you wait for the perfect vehicle for your acting to appear,"" states Carlson. </p>

<p><strong><u>We Need Your Help!</u></strong> Great ideas are a dime a dozen. Getting the money to move forward is the hard part.

<ul>
<li>Creative input in our show by naming victims, landmarks and dressing our characters. </li>
<li> <strong>The ability to put brands in our project at a very affordable price is available to you. </strong>As low as $500 and your brand enjoys perpetual life on our series. AND, if we get the Emmy nod, we take you with us!</li>

<h3>Brand Sponsorship:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each episode, for our first season, will be shot on a micro-budget of $10,000. This will create 15 minutes of quality drama and use familiar names in the soap opera genre.</li>
<li>For a $500 donation and the product for our main cast (or entire cast, we keep our cast small in each episode), a brand will be highlighted in the episode. Season sponsors welcome. Email us for details.<ul>
<li>Select the perk for Female Shoes.</li>
<li>In Episode 1, we have three females and four different wardrobe changes. The opportunity is to put in 3-12 pairs of a particular shoe brand.</li>
<li>We will photograph each pair of shoes in the scenes and post those photos on our social media, tagging the brand. </li>
<li>The photos will also be available for the brand to use in their own advertising. </li>
<li>The shoes will be seen in the episode, everywhere it airs, for as long as it airs. That could be years! It could be global.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A $500 donation and product for an episode, with left over products being gifted to the cast after each episode in a pretty gift bag:<ul>
<li>Makeup for our entire cast</li>
<li>Hair products for our entire cast</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>A $1000 donation and you can name a victim in the episode. Our screenwriter will create the backstory and will email you a signed copy of the script (once aired) with your victim named. </p></li>
<li>A $1000 donation and the brand will be incorporated across multiple episodes, depending on the type of brand. It requires the donation and the product. Examples are:<ul>
<li>Tea in the cabinet (all episodes)</li>
<li>Coffee maker on the counter (all episodes)</li>
<li>Make-up on the dresser</li>
<li>Magazines and books</li>
<li>Snacks and beverages used in cabinets, on tables, in stores, in normal life situations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A donation of $2500 and we will incorporate your brand into various show landmarks for the entire season. Your brand could be incorporated into:<ul>
<li>The bar</li>
<li>The high rise apartment</li>
<li>The prison</li>
<li>The street (we have a couple streets)</li>
<li>The restaurant </li>
</ul>
</li>

What is A Blind Eye?
A visual thriller. An unseen killer. 

""A BLIND EYE"" is a crime thriller series, developed for a streaming platform and adaptable for other media. 
 

 

About The Project: A Blind Eye
‘A BLIND EYE' has a killer script, a crew ready to bring it to life and WE HAVE distribution to get it out to the audience.
A BLIND EYE : Everything begins to fall in place as Valentina De Luca gains the trust of Chicago Police Department detectives Matthew Coleman and Karen Jackson by feigning blindness. Believing her story about having visions about the murders, she manipulates the detectives and begins to frame the men who put her father in prison. Marisa, Valentina's roommate and Matthew's sister, garners another win as she tries to connect with her brother. Karen starts keeping secrets from Matthew about her personal life as the police Captain struggles with his addiction while trying to balance a home life.

Get Onboard! This fundraiser is about helping this timely show that puts women in roles which portray them as strong, independent characters, on the airways.
The concept for the show comes from actress Nicole Criss (A HORSE FOR SUMMER) and the screenplay and story is award-winning actress Mandalynn Carlson (GREY'S ANATOMY). Their goal was to work on a woman-centric project ▬ one created by, written, produced, directed and distributed by women.
According to an article by Brent Lang for Variety Magazine on 10/27/15, who quoted the results of a 2014 study from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University:

In 2014, 85% of films had no female directors, 80% had no female writers, 33% had no female producers, 78% had no female editors and 92% had no female cinematographers.
Women comprised 13% of directors on the top 700 films, but just 7% on the top 250 films.
Women made up 13% of writers on the top 700 films, and 11% on the top 250 films.
Women made up 27% of producers on the top 700 films, while 23% on the top 250 films were female.
Women accounted for 9% of cinematographers on the top 700 films, but 5% of cinematographers on the top 250 pictures.
The number of female editors stayed consistent at 18% in both test samples.

Evidence suggests that women in positions of power are more likely to employ other women. The study also suggests:

Films with female directors, women comprised 52% of writers, 35% of editors and 26% of cinematographers. When men directed, the number of female writers shrank to 8%, editors fell to 15% and cinematographers dropped to 5%.
The same is true for directing opportunities. Women comprised 20% of directors on projects where at least a third of the producers were female, but just 7% of directors when the representation of female producers fell below that percentage.

 
Let’s help encourage young women like Mandalynn and Nicole to change the landscape of filmmaking! Support our campaign for A BLIND EYE.
 
 

ABOUT US: Nandar Pictures LLC is a family of filmmakers in a variety of genres. Our first series, a single cam comedy is being looked at by Netflix and has already been funded.  ""A BLIND EYE"" will be our first drama series and our goal is to fund, create and air in time for Daytime Emmy nominations.
Our Goal: Six episodes for the first phase,  with a total of 18 episodes for a complete season. Having enough episodes available, creates an opportunity for people to binge watch, like what they see and ask for more. This also allows us to take a successful ""showing"" in the marketplace to the online platform leaders like Amazon, NetFlix, Hulu and pitch the show as one of their original shows.

To get the most bang for our backer's money, those who have businesses, we offer the opportunity to get wide-exposure that is affordable for businesses of all sizes.

 The ability to put brands in our project at a very affordable price is available to you. As low as $500 and your brand enjoys perpetual life on our series. AND, if we get the Emmy nod, we take you with us!
Twenty major sponsors per episode and we can pay quality name actors who daytime drama fans will recognize.
The funds will allow us to produce a high-quality episode.

Opening up our show to brand sponsorship is a win-win. For less than the cost of a newspaper ad, a brand could be seen ""normal use in a slice of life"" visual ad. And, the exposure is nearly unlimited. Our distributor is able to put this show into the global marketplace. All of our sponsors will get perpetual exposure of their brand, globally, for the life of the show. If it does into syndication, that means a long life for the small price.
Are you ready to take your brand to this level? This project has guaranteed distribution! Your products will be seen on a broad scale.
 
 

 

Brand Sponsorship:

Each episode, for our first season, will be shot on a micro-budget of $10,000. This will create 15 minutes of quality drama and use familiar names in the soap opera genre.
For a $500 donation and the product for our main cast (or entire cast, we keep our cast small in each episode), a brand will be highlighted in the episode. Season sponsors welcome. Email us for details.
Select the perk for Female Shoes.
In Episode 1, we have three females and four different wardrobe changes. The opportunity is to put in 3-12 pairs of a particular shoe brand.
We will photograph each pair of shoes in the scenes and post those photos on our social media, tagging the brand. 
The photos will also be available for the brand to use in their own advertising. 
The shoes will be seen in the episode, everywhere it airs, for as long as it airs. That could be years! It could be global.


A $500 donation and product for an episode, with left over products being gifted to the cast after each episode in a pretty gift bag:
Makeup for our entire cast
Hair products for our entire cast


A $1000 donation and you can name a victim in the episode. Our screenwriter will create the backstory and will email you a signed copy of the script (once aired) with your victim named. 
A $1000 donation and the brand will be incorporated across multiple episodes, depending on the type of brand. It requires the donation and the product. Examples are:
Tea in the cabinet (all episodes)
Coffee maker on the counter (all episodes)
Make-up on the dresser
Magazines and books
Snacks and beverages used in cabinets, on tables, in stores, in normal life situations


A donation of $2500 and we will incorporate your brand into various show landmarks for the entire season. Your brand could be incorporated into:
The bar
The high rise apartment
The prison
The street (we have a couple streets)

Evie is one of the most warm-hearted, kind, caring, jovial, and giving people you'll ever meet; her ability to make people feel welcome and appreciated is astounding. Superpowers: Sonic scream; siren song (can bend a person's will to hers by singing).</li>
<li>
<strong>Keilah Wilson as Bryn Cooke. </strong>Bryn is 17, extremely socially and politically active (she is an aspiring journalist), and a military brat. After the loss of her mother Korinne, she and her father moved to Champaign to be closer to her grandmother. The loss, which shattered both their worlds, forged an even closer relationship with her father. She is one of Evie's best friends and is on the school newspaper staff with her. Superpower: Super intelligence; developing telekinesis. </li>
<li>
<strong>Jess Schlipf as Hayden Bennet. </strong>Hayden is 17, and has become a close confidant of Evie, and a good friend with the rest of the group. She's formed a bond with Tempest--Hayden was once the new kid just like Tempest--and has helped her adjust. On the surface, Hayden is friendly but after years of battling insecurities has developed defenses that can cause her personality to flip quickly. No super powers.</li>
<li>
<strong>McKenzie Deremiah as Tempest Grace.  </strong> Tempest is a 15-year-old dance student who has a love for ballet. She has only been studying for about 6 months or so, but has oddly picked everything up rapidly. Tempest identifies as Queer, and currently has a crush on a junior named Bree. While socially awkward and not entirely skilled at making friends, when she is able to she is incredibly loyal to them. Such is the case as the group of girls (Evie, Bryn, and Hayden) have welcomed them into the group. For most of her youth Tempest has searched for friends to help her break out of her shell, and finally, she's found said friends. She and Hayden have formed a close bond as they both battle through insecurities. Superpower: We'll just call it ""kinesthetics"" for now. She has a sort of super agility, is able to pick up and replicate physical movements (sports, dance, etc) extremely quickly, and can foresee a person's movements/attacks several steps ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Selima Samaha- TBA. </strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Madelyn Childress as Bree Gonzales. </strong>Bree, 16, is a warm, caring, bubbly person who sees the best in people. Her mother is of Filipino decent (her father white), and she is learning to appreciate the culture of her ancestors. She has fallen in love with graphic design, and does most of the design for the high school's newspaper. Also Tempest's crush, the two of them build a close relationship in which Bree becomes the yang to Tempest's yin. Bree helps Tempest come out of her shell, and become more comfortable with herself.</li>
<li>
<strong>Prince F. Robertson as Dr. Gregory ""Greg"" Cooke. </strong>Greg, 42 and Bryn's stern yet loving father, is a recently retired Colonel in the U.S. Army. After graduating from Westpoint, his exceptional intelligence helped him climb the military ranks quite rapidly until he reached Colonel by his mid-30s, in addition to obtaining a PhD while serving his country. As a military intelligence and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) officer, Greg conducted biological/scientific research on the regenerative capabilities in animals and their potential human applications. Said research was pushed along after the manifestation of his own regenerative powers—these powers explain why Greg appears to look much younger than he actually is. By the time of his retirement, he had reached the rank of colonel and certainly had a much longer and illustrious career ahead of him. However, his decision to retire and move back home to teach at the University of Illinois was spurred on by two factors: 1) his fear of the military discovering his powers and using them immorally/for military medicine and weapons (these fears weren't completely off base as military intelligence began suspecting something and 2) the death of his wife Korinne—she was killed as a superpowered individual attempted to stop a robbery. Very much in love with her, her death shook Greg to the core and left him guilt- ridden for not being there to use his powers to protect her. Seeking comfort and now raising his now 16-year-old daughter Bryn alone, he retired, moved back home to be near his parents in Champaign, and accepted a position as a professor at the university. To this day he has kept his powers completely secret.</li>
<li>
<strong>James R. Ling as Alex Davenport.</strong>  Alex, 30, is a PhD candidate at the local university and works as a TA for Bryn Cooke's father Gregory. What Alex lacks in powers, he makes up for in intelligence and his ability to absorb new information quickly. Throughout his academic career, Alex has been obsessed with the regenerative nature of certain organisms. That obsession leads him to discover Gregory Cooke's research, which in turn became the catalyst for Alex's desire to work under Cooke.</li>

<h3>What We Need to Get</h3>
<p>For this leg of the crowdfunding campaign, we are seeking a total of $4,000. Your donations to this campaign will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Production/Production/Post-Production Costs (Test shots, equipment rental, crew, reshoots/pick ups if necessary)</li>
<li>Catering/Crafts Table for Cast and Crew</li>
<li>Props/Practical Effects</li>
<li>Travel and Lodging for One or Two Cast Members</li>
<li>Fulfilling perks</li>
</ul>
<p>Any excess or leftover funds will be applied to branding such as posters, etc., and used to fund the full season. </p>
<p>Perks for contributing will range from a hearty thank you to digital and physical copies of both the pilot and the script to actual props from production to even invitations to set, screenings, and after parties. We even offer an opportunity to be an executive producer. </p>
<p>Funds, if we reach at least 80% of our goal but fall short, will still be applied to production costs as best we can. If we do not raise enough funds, production will not be possible and refunds will be offered. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>While our overall goal is to create an entertaining and well-produced pilot episode, our intentions are to bring a new perspective to the superhero genre. As superhero and comic book fans, we have grown frustrated with not only the lackluster representation of females, but also realistic female heroes when they are present. We have decided to remedy this issue by creating superheroes women, young and old alike, can relate to and support. No fawning over boys. No costumes that make them look like Jane Fonda in an exercise video. Real, down to earth, teenage girls that face everyday struggles and just happen to have powers. </li>
<li>In addition to the female representation, we seek to tackle issues that currently face the nation; issues/topics that we feel the nation needs to see and hear. </li>
<li>In the end, we hope to create a world of superheroes that ALL people can look up to and cheer on. </li>

As a military intelligence and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) officer, Greg conducted biological/scientific research on the regenerative capabilities in animals and their potential human applications. Said research was pushed along after the manifestation of his own regenerative powers—these powers explain why Greg appears to look much younger than he actually is. By the time of his retirement, he had reached the rank of colonel and certainly had a much longer and illustrious career ahead of him. However, his decision to retire and move back home to teach at the University of Illinois was spurred on by two factors: 1) his fear of the military discovering his powers and using them immorally/for military medicine and weapons (these fears weren't completely off base as military intelligence began suspecting something and 2) the death of his wife Korinne—she was killed as a superpowered individual attempted to stop a robbery. Very much in love with her, her death shook Greg to the core and left him guilt- ridden for not being there to use his powers to protect her. Seeking comfort and now raising his now 16-year-old daughter Bryn alone, he retired, moved back home to be near his parents in Champaign, and accepted a position as a professor at the university. To this day he has kept his powers completely secret.

James R. Ling as Alex Davenport.  Alex, 30, is a PhD candidate at the local university and works as a TA for Bryn Cooke's father Gregory. What Alex lacks in powers, he makes up for in intelligence and his ability to absorb new information quickly. Throughout his academic career, Alex has been obsessed with the regenerative nature of certain organisms. That obsession leads him to discover Gregory Cooke's research, which in turn became the catalyst for Alex's desire to work under Cooke.


What We Need to Get
For this leg of the crowdfunding campaign, we are seeking a total of $4,000. Your donations to this campaign will cover the following:

Pre-Production/Production/Post-Production Costs (Test shots, equipment rental, crew, reshoots/pick ups if necessary)
Catering/Crafts Table for Cast and Crew
Props/Practical Effects
Travel and Lodging for One or Two Cast Members
Fulfilling perks

Any excess or leftover funds will be applied to branding such as posters, etc., and used to fund the full season. 
Perks for contributing will range from a hearty thank you to digital and physical copies of both the pilot and the script to actual props from production to even invitations to set, screenings, and after parties. We even offer an opportunity to be an executive producer. 
Funds, if we reach at least 80% of our goal but fall short, will still be applied to production costs as best we can. If we do not raise enough funds, production will not be possible and refunds will be offered. 
The Impact

While our overall goal is to create an entertaining and well-produced pilot episode, our intentions are to bring a new perspective to the superhero genre. As superhero and comic book fans, we have grown frustrated with not only the lackluster representation of females, but also realistic female heroes when they are present. We have decided to remedy this issue by creating superheroes women, young and old alike, can relate to and support. No fawning over boys. No costumes that make them look like Jane Fonda in an exercise video. Real, down to earth, teenage girls that face everyday struggles and just happen to have powers. 
In addition to the female representation, we seek to tackle issues that currently face the nation; issues/topics that we feel the nation needs to see and hear. 
In the end, we hope to create a world of superheroes that ALL people can look up to and cheer on.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h2><strong>Story Time!</strong></h2>
<p>ThingzThatMakeUGoHmmm is a online game show created by WeAre1CHICAGO.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WeAre1CHICAGO United, NFP is an organization that focus on creating programs, activities and events that financially support the younger generation in Chicago. With all that is going on today, we feel it is extremely important to support our youth and create a bridge to help make their dreams a reality. Some of the current programs we have is ""I Love The 90s Millennium Virtual Show"", ""ChiTown Movie Nite"", and ""ThingzThatMakeUGoHmmm"".</p>
<p><strong>“I Love The 90s Millennium Virtual Show”</strong>, is a tribute showcase to artists from 1990-2005. Hosted by Greg Owens, Dedrick D. Banks Gray, &amp; SJ Williams.  Performances by various artists from episode 1-5! We have partnered up with WeAre1CHICAGO and ThingzThatMakeUGoHmmm to assist these artists and the production team during COVID-19. The audience can literally donate to these artists directly through CashApp to show support and win prizes. </p>
<p><strong>“ChiTown Movie Nite”</strong>, gives independent filmmakers a platform to showcase their work while also bringing the city together. There is a submission process in order to be approved. This program takes place once a month. </p>
<p><strong>""ThingzThatMakeUGoHmmm""</strong>, is a program that was specifically created to raise money for the younger comedians and entertainers in the Chicagoland area.This show will highlight the creativity, the humor and talents of our young Chicago natives, giving you 1 hour of pure entertainment!</p>
<p> My name is Jae Davis, born and raised on the south side of the Chicagoland area.  I'm able to live out my passion everyday as a producer who curates her own content. I also work with artists who are looking for platforms to share their art. </p>
<p>I see my city as something that has great potential and amazing creativity when it comes to our youth and young adults. In the past, our youth have been let down with our lack of involvement and consistency with helping to nourish and catapult their talents and gifts. It is important that we look past today’s and yesterday’s issues, and channel with them to future possibilities for their generation. COVID-19 will not slow us down. </p>
<p>Our team decided that this game show will help our country to #stayhome and #staysafe. We created a way that we can support our youth and young adults with donations and more opportunities during this second wave of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>This game show will give great energy... like the youth of the<br/>90’s era that stood for unity, justice and equality. I am excited and thrilled to share with you, ThingzThatMakeUGoHmmm!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Easy As 1-2-3 </strong></h2>
<p>The game show will consist of 2 teams of 4 players on each team. Each team  will have special invited guests (influencers, celebrities, VIPs, etc.) and  random individuals from our youth community. There will be 5 games with 3 rounds each game.  Each round gives each team a chance to win the cash prize for that game, allowing everyone to walk away a winner.</p>
<p>Youth can watch the show with a chance of winning monetary prizes to invest in their craft/school supplies by summarizing the episode or answering the questions asked during the game. </p>
<p>This series will be live on a weekly basis available via, Twitch,  YouTube and Facebook.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>The support from our community can come in many forms. The first phase to build the consistency that we want comes at a price. We are asking for the public to invest in their youth. Our overall goal is to raise over $300,000, with a goal to donate at least $10,000 each week for 30 weeks.  However, we are requesting $60K at a time, to allow us to continue the process of fundraising as we build the pot. The funding that is raised will be used for the following;</p>
<ul>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Recording, Editing, Techs (hired youth and young adults in the community)</li>
<li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Promotion (Social media, Billboards, Radio)</li>

</ul>
<h2><strong>The Impact </strong></h2>
<p>We know just about everyone in Chicago wants to see these better days ahead and would like to participate the best way they can. Well, we’ve created the platform and now we need your help to push for our city.</p>
<p>This is not our first attempt to create resources for our Youth in Chicago.  We did a live show, bringing all of the popular local acts together, creating unity, diversity and overall more opportunities.  However, we didn't have the monetary resources to promote it, therefore, majority of Chicago wasn't able to support because they didn't know that it was even happening.  That's why, this year, we need your support.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Contribute</strong></h2>
<p>Every bit helps even if your donation isn't monetary. Other items you can donate are the following: </p>
<ul>

I'm the host of <i>The Fallen State</i>, a unique and wildly popular YouTube series. In little more than two years, we've garnered over 17 million views, multiple viral videos, and 175,000 subscribers. Why?</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541438715/xfrlnrquoogtnsm2ojmn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>The Fallen State</i> is compelling content at its finest.  It’s unscripted, unpredictable, and authentic.  Every time I sit down to interview someone, I’m 100% honest and myself. I never know exactly where my conversations are going to lead.  It's led some of my guests to major breakthroughs. Other guests have stormed off the set in anger.  But regardless of how it may go over, I always tell the truth. And viewers constantly tell me that the show is a breath of fresh air.</p><p>At <i>The Fallen State</i>, we love variety.  On any given week, you'll find something new and exciting: from timely, cinematically-edited “man-on-the-street” interviews, to intense debates, to meaningful dialogues.  And our guests are incredibly diverse! From entertaining “regular folks,” to celebrity therapist Dr. Drew, to an anarcho-communist, to SlutWalk creator Amber Rose and conservative commentator Ann Coulter—our guests run the gamut.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541440860/sefmbnzklwivjqpkyquy.png"" src=""""/></p><p>I ask the questions no one else will, and tackle the spiritual, political, and cultural topics others run from. In this age of safe spaces and politically correct thought police, <i>The Fallen State</i> stands out like a beacon.  Furthermore, we are not beholden to any network, handler, or advertiser restricting our speech and content.</p><p>Unfortunately, not everyone wants to see free thought and free dialogue flourish.  Because of this, we’re being targeted. George Soros-funded Media Matters for America wants to see us removed from YouTube. They're calling me (a black man) a racist and... wait for it... a white supremacist, of all things!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542064635/cwhkl1lq85of41kdhpcq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>It's incredibly ironic, as <i>The Fallen State</i> gives a voice to the most diverse spectrum of voices imaginable.  We feature guests of every race, gender, income level, age, faith, and political affiliation.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541625740/cwp1doag3iyyxumknlrq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We will not cave to this threat.

As a result of this old equipment, our editors, graphic designers, and producers are forced to spend far too much time completing tasks.

I'm the host of The Fallen State, a unique and wildly popular YouTube series. In little more than two years, we've garnered over 17 million views, multiple viral videos, and 175,000 subscribers. Why?The Fallen State is compelling content at its finest.  It’s unscripted, unpredictable, and authentic.  Every time I sit down to interview someone, I’m 100% honest and myself. I never know exactly where my conversations are going to lead.  It's led some of my guests to major breakthroughs. Other guests have stormed off the set in anger.  But regardless of how it may go over, I always tell the truth. And viewers constantly tell me that the show is a breath of fresh air.At The Fallen State, we love variety.  On any given week, you'll find something new and exciting: from timely, cinematically-edited “man-on-the-street” interviews, to intense debates, to meaningful dialogues.  And our guests are incredibly diverse! From entertaining “regular folks,” to celebrity therapist Dr. Drew, to an anarcho-communist, to SlutWalk creator Amber Rose and conservative commentator Ann Coulter—our guests run the gamut.I ask the questions no one else will, and tackle the spiritual, political, and cultural topics others run from. In this age of safe spaces and politically correct thought police, The Fallen State stands out like a beacon.  Furthermore, we are not beholden to any network, handler, or advertiser restricting our speech and content.Unfortunately, not everyone wants to see free thought and free dialogue flourish.  Because of this, we’re being targeted. George Soros-funded Media Matters for America wants to see us removed from YouTube. They're calling me (a black man) a racist and... wait for it... a white supremacist, of all things!It's incredibly ironic, as The Fallen State gives a voice to the most diverse spectrum of voices imaginable.  We feature guests of every race, gender, income level, age, faith, and political affiliation.We will not cave to this threat. In fact, we are seeking your help to make the show even BETTER, making necessary upgrades to reach even more people who seek truth and enlightenment.Support a platform where you—not the censors—get to decide which viewpoints you’ll accept. Your views will be challenged, you’ll laugh, you’ll tear up, you may even get mad—but you'll be entertained while gaining a greater understanding about yourself and the world we live in. The digital domain is rife with competition, and producing shows of exceptional quality is an absolute must. Our equipment is woefully dated, and we are holding the show together pretty much with wire and duct tape right now.The two most glaring problems are The Fallen State computers and cameras.  Two of these computers are dinosaurs (Macs from 2009).  And the remaining computers are operating with outdated software.  Then there’s the most indispensable type of gear for a TV show: the cameras.  Ours are 10 years old! As a result of this old equipment, our editors, graphic designers, and producers are forced to spend far too much time completing tasks. And even then, the visuals don’t end up as vibrant nor as sharp as they could with the latest tech updates.Then there are the issues with our audio:  We’ve experienced everything from bad microphone malfunctions, to challenges syncing audio and visuals.  We had to pull a popular episode because the audio and visual aspects were grossly mismatched (picture an old poorly dubbed Chinese Kung Fu movie!).Cameras, sound equipment, computers, and software happen to be some of the priciest items to replace.  So it's crucial that we raise $40,000 to make the necessary upgrades to the show to improve its look, sound, and entertainment value, and make The Fallen State TV better than ever before. Here's a breakdown of what we need and what it will accomplish: CAMERAS & ACCESSORIES total = $17,400 (44.5%)-4 cameras: $16,000Our current cameras are from 2008.  In order to stay competitive, we need updated equipment that shoots higher-quality video. -2 tripods: $1,400Our current tripods are inadequate for panning or moving the camera.  Having tripods will cut down on shaky shots so we capture the footage right the first time. PRODUCTION / EDITING / DESIGN total = $12,600 (32.2%)-3 HD camera monitors: $600This allows our crew to see three different camera shots on large, high-definition screens, which prevents mistakes from happening while filming.  Saves time in post-production, and prevents re-shoots. -3 iMacs with software: $12,000This allows us to update our team's outdated, malfunctioning computers. It also enables us to expand our production team so that everyone has access to the equipment they need. SOUND total = $5,880 (15.1%)-8-track field audio recorder: $1,100This recorder seamlessly syncs the audio portion of the show with the video portion—normally a painstaking process. This will also let us incorporate more multi-guest panel discussions and debates on the show. Saves major time in the editing room and makes the show look and sound more professional. -3 lavalier microphones: $3,180Enables us to have live panels on the show (including up to 4 guests simultaneously) and saves us from paying to rent equipment.   -Boom microphone with boom pull: $1,200Helps us capture audio much better during our ""man-on-the street"" filming, shooting promotions and commercials, etc. -Wireless receiver: $400Allows us to film street interviews using a cordless mic. This makes it much easier to maneuver in crowded events. STORAGE total = $2,000 (5.1%)-SSD drives and SDXC cards: $2,000These store hours of valuable footage from the show, and transfer the data between devices. No room for failure. SET total = $1,200 (3.1%)-Green Screen background: $200Enables editors to add special visual effects in post production. This saves us time and money because we don’t have to go elsewhere to film or pay for another studio. -Darker Black Curtain: $1,000This will improve the overall color quality of the show and cut down on adjustments in post-production. GRAND TOTAL: $17,400 + $12,600 + $5,880 + $2,000 + $1,200 = $39,080 The Fallen State started in January of 2016 with no subscribers, no headlines, and no connections to big celebrities.  In little more than two years, we’ve created a cultural, political and spiritual earthquake felt around the world by the rich and famous, as well as the unknown.As an example, one of our most impactful shows was with Amber Rose.  It went viral, getting picked up everywhere—from Yahoo! News, to BET, The Daily Mail, PerezHilton.com, Vibe, Fox News, TooFab, Vlad TV, XXL Mag, and much more.  In this exclusive interview, Amber Rose weighed in on her ex, Kanye West, pronouncing that Donald Trump was ""Kanye in a white man's body.""It was this same interview that created the viral ""slutmaker"" meme.  As a SlutWalk organizer, Rose strives to take the stigma out of the word ""slut.""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Allyson. In 2010 I placed my son for adoption. It was the hardest thing I've done in my life. My son is now 8, and I'm very fortunate for our relationship. I'm looking to make a web series about the various sides of adoption. We will have people share stories, discuss open, semi-open and closed adoptions. How the foster care system has changed kid's lives, and much more. The series will air in February 2019 and run 10 episodes for the first season. </p>
<p>I wanted to start this project because adoption is something I think about everyday. As a birth mother there aren't a lot of places to express your thoughts. I wanted to learn what kids in the foster system deal with. How does being adopted into a family at various ages change a child? How does adopting a child change a family dynamic? What are different reasons birth parents placed their children? I want to give people a platform to share their experiences, and a place to relate.</p>
<p>Helping fund this campaign will help in many ways. I'll be able to travel to more cities, and collect more stories. Currently I am planning on traveling to California, Illinois, Florida and Georgia. I'll be able to help pay for the crew's travel and food. The funds will also help donate clothes and school items to foster children.</p>

I have a degree in Scriptwriting for Film &amp; TV and a masters in Producing for Film &amp; TV from Bournemouth University, UK – and I've also completed a Sundance Directing course, Carbon Literacy training and a bunch of other cool stuff. I'm a 2020 Nicholl Fellowship semifinalist, a Mind Media Award nominee, and most recently won my first award for a short film drama script about how hoarding disorder affects a family.</p><p>I’ve written a lot of drama but I’m also very much a student of comedy, and Litter Pickers is the culmination of everything I enjoy about comedy, and British sitcoms in particular - the main three influences being Spaced, Father Ted and Detectorists. Father Ted mainly for its affectionately odd characters and surreal situations, Spaced for similar reasons plus the dynamic directorial style of Edgar Wright and the inspired music mix, and Detectorists for its outdoors setting and gentle characterisations. Mix up all three with my own unique perspective on life and you get Litter Pickers!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621113195/hlkzw5dmn02mvttbif3j.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>For this series, we’re engaging with the important theme of caring for our environment. Our trio of litter pickers are spending their time tidying up their local community – the best place for anyone to start! And it’s also an activity that can have the added benefit of positive mental wellbeing from spending time outside in nature. While of course having a lot of laughs along the way, I believe that Litter Pickers can provide another positive way to get these messages out there and hopefully encourage at least a few more people not to litter. I also think that now more than ever, we need comedy! Through contributing to our project, you’ll be directly helping to spread these messages and some laughter – similar to that bigger theme of cleaning up our environment – it can only happen through the involvement of many awesome people!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621113504/kumvwwugd0tssshiesij.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Supporting local talent is important to me, and I’ve been very lucky to find three incredibly talented actors local to Bedfordshire, UK. <strong>Albert Welling</strong> (Succession, Doctor Who, Outlander) has a list of credits longer than anyone’s leg and will be playing our lead litter picker, the naïve and luckless nature-lover Charlie. <strong>Jordan Lewis</strong> is an upcoming comedy talent who writes and produces his own comedy sketches – Litter Pickers will be his first step into series content as he plays Brighton, the kind-hearted yet reluctant environmentalist. And last but not least, <strong>Elizabeth Cristo</strong>, is returning to work with me again after starring as Anxiety in my previous project Today or Not Today, and she is playing the dog-loving , doll-playing rebel, Jess.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621113338/tx0vhvhcpn7kfgtbgi29.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Charlie, Brighton, Jess – three very different characters who find it difficult to understand each other at first, they’re thrown together, and yet somehow a wonderful friendship forms between this unlikely trio.

I have a degree in Scriptwriting for Film & TV and a masters in Producing for Film & TV from Bournemouth University, UK – and I've also completed a Sundance Directing course, Carbon Literacy training and a bunch of other cool stuff. I'm a 2020 Nicholl Fellowship semifinalist, a Mind Media Award nominee, and most recently won my first award for a short film drama script about how hoarding disorder affects a family.I’ve written a lot of drama but I’m also very much a student of comedy, and Litter Pickers is the culmination of everything I enjoy about comedy, and British sitcoms in particular - the main three influences being Spaced, Father Ted and Detectorists. Father Ted mainly for its affectionately odd characters and surreal situations, Spaced for similar reasons plus the dynamic directorial style of Edgar Wright and the inspired music mix, and Detectorists for its outdoors setting and gentle characterisations. Mix up all three with my own unique perspective on life and you get Litter Pickers!For this series, we’re engaging with the important theme of caring for our environment. Our trio of litter pickers are spending their time tidying up their local community – the best place for anyone to start! And it’s also an activity that can have the added benefit of positive mental wellbeing from spending time outside in nature. While of course having a lot of laughs along the way, I believe that Litter Pickers can provide another positive way to get these messages out there and hopefully encourage at least a few more people not to litter. I also think that now more than ever, we need comedy! Through contributing to our project, you’ll be directly helping to spread these messages and some laughter – similar to that bigger theme of cleaning up our environment – it can only happen through the involvement of many awesome people!Supporting local talent is important to me, and I’ve been very lucky to find three incredibly talented actors local to Bedfordshire, UK. Albert Welling (Succession, Doctor Who, Outlander) has a list of credits longer than anyone’s leg and will be playing our lead litter picker, the naïve and luckless nature-lover Charlie. Jordan Lewis is an upcoming comedy talent who writes and produces his own comedy sketches – Litter Pickers will be his first step into series content as he plays Brighton, the kind-hearted yet reluctant environmentalist. And last but not least, Elizabeth Cristo, is returning to work with me again after starring as Anxiety in my previous project Today or Not Today, and she is playing the dog-loving , doll-playing rebel, Jess.Charlie, Brighton, Jess – three very different characters who find it difficult to understand each other at first, they’re thrown together, and yet somehow a wonderful friendship forms between this unlikely trio. Each character has a secret, and these individual and collective story arcs show how everyone has hurdles to overcome as we go about trying to achieve our hopes and dreams in life. The end message will be one of hope as we come to learn about our trio and care about what’s best for them, while laughing at them and with them along the way. And as you’ll see from the additional content that will be released throughout this campaign, the actors are already so passionate about the themes of Litter Pickers, their characters, and the potential of the series.In terms of filmmaking talent, I will be working with award-winning Director of Photography Malgorzata (Gosia) Pronko. Gosia has a wealth of experience that includes shooting a comedy feature, and a superhuman skill for finding beautiful shots that convey the mood of a scene. She’s as excited as me to get started on the challenge of making Litter Pickers as visually appealing as possible, with that Edgar Wright dynamism being an important influence on our style while incorporating our own sensibilities and what we love about the comedy genre.And I'm equally delighted that Colin Skevington has agreed to come aboard as Production Manager.

<h3><strong>Our Story</strong></h3>
<p>Trillo &amp; Suede is a multi-award-winning film noir parody web series, featuring a ventriloquist detective and his wooden partner. All ten episodes of Season 1 were released in early 2020 on our youtube channel: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/TrilloSuede"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/c/TrilloSuede</a></p>
<p>The series has been burning up the international film festival circuit. Winner for Best Web Series at the New York International Film Awards; Winner for Best Web Series at the MP Film Award; Winner for Best Web Series at the Top Shorts Film Festival; Winner for Best Comedy at the Assurdo Film Festival, Milan Italy; Winner of the Outstanding Achievement Award at the IndieX Film Fest, Hollywood CA; Winner of the Bronze Medal in the Independent Shorts Awards...and numerous other awards.</p>
<p>I (Jonathan Geffner) am the writer/creator/executive producer/lead actor.  A real-life professional ventriloquist, I play the roles of both Trillo and Suede. Inspired by the tremendous critical success of Season 1, I have written all ten episodes of Season 2, and have lined up most of the cast and crew to shoot it. We plan to shoot it as soon as the pandemic situation allows us to - this July/August if it is safe to do so, or as soon afterward as possible. It will be shot in and around New York City, as was Season 1.</p>
<p>Join us now in the creation of Season 2 of this uniquely exciting project, and receive some cool perks for your support!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>Our Goal &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Every dollar of your contribution will go toward the production of Trillo &amp; Suede Season 2. Our $22,000 goal will barely cover the cost of shooting and editing Season 2 on a very tight budget. If we are fortunate enough to surpass our goal, every dollar of it will go toward adding production value to the episodes - to do some of the shots and scenes that we would love to do if our budget will allow us to - plus the many additional costs of promoting the series: film festival fees and transportation costs, additional post-production costs, social media ads, costs involved with pitching the series to Netflix and other cable tv platforms etc.</p>
<p>All of our talented cast and crew will be working for very modest fees because of their enthusiasm for and belief in the Trillo &amp; Suede project. But even modest fees will add up quickly over the ten or eleven 12-hour days that we will need to shoot Season 2. Plus there will be equipment rental fees, location fees, transportation fees, cost of props and wardrobe, and lots of nutritious food to keep our cast and crew well-fed and energetic throughout the grueling-yet-exciting shoot. </p>
<p>Season 2 will be even wilder and crazier than Season 1. I am determined to bring my vision to life even if our campaign goal is not met. But your support will greatly reduce the stress of worrying about the financial strain on my own pocket, and allow us all to better focus on making Season 2 the amazing project that it has the potential to be. And you'll get some cool perks in appreciation for your support.</p>

<p>Security Television Network (STN) specializes in “breaking stories about victims, criminals, justice, security business and financial market news.” STN is the world's first television channel to provide 24-hour security news coverage -- poised to shape the future of security communication.</p>
<p>Before I share more about the channel, it’s fair that you should know something about who is bringing this Indiegogo campaign to you for support.  Here is a fact, we’re ready to deliver to you a service that I believe every informed citizen needs, and should become familiar with our start-up, the worlds first 24-hour security news channel. </p>
<p>Our great country is being challenged by those who choose to divide us by race, political ideology, and the right of a collective people to feel secure. </p>
<p>The second paragraph of the United States Declaration of Independence, however, lets us know and we shall remember that: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.  While these words and ideals are enshrined in our collective culture as Americans, we’re blitzed by sensational and exploitative soundbite news, the nationalization of media, thousands of news outlets with varying levels of quality and integrity, and what appears to remain are ideological debates, which fail to embrace the promise of a shared destiny.   While I’m hopeful, it’s clear our common stories that unite and connect us as people, are under siege.</p>
<p>America, is where I was born and raised.  I grew-up living on the fence line of a strawberry farm in Norwich, CT.  Life quickly changed, however, when my mother, a single mom of five children, became one of the first women welders at General Dynamics, working night shifts in subzero temperatures to weld the hull of a “Trident” nuclear submarine. Since this time, I became well aware of what it would take to keep a country safe, and how the creation of might can be a deterrent to war, not invite war.  The Big Stick Ideology by, President <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Theodore_Roosevelt#Foreign_policy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Theodore Roosevelt</a>’s foreign policy: ""speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.""</p>
<p><u>STN news coverage will include</u>:</p>
<p><strong>Gun Violence Epidemic</strong>, Full disclosure, the founder of STN, Dr. James Hall, joined the NRA before he became a teenager, raised on the belief that owning a gun is an American value. He grew up hunting and fishing but no longer has an interest in shooting animals.  Today, his values of safety and gun ownership are challenged by gun violence, which is a public health epidemic. Many innocent people died as a result of firearm injuries every year in the United States, while so many others are wounded. How do we balance these competing values of safe gun ownership and the gun violence epidemic?  It’s time to move past single events, dig deeper into the root cause(s) of this epidemic, and deliver the long-form news to allow for real-change.  In fact, 39,707 Americans died from gun violence in 2019. This equates to over 3,300 gun deaths each month, over 763 gun deaths a week, and nearly 109 people killed with guns every day. The numbers are staggering, and we must never forget that behind them are very real stories of people with stories of their own.  Individuals who are no longer with us because of a preventable tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>Domestic terrorism</strong>, Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.</p>
<p><strong>International terrorism</strong>,﻿ Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups who are inspired by, or associated with, designated foreign terrorist organizations or nations (state-sponsored).</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>, the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at assessing, modifying, or destroying sensitive information; <strong>Ransomware</strong>: extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer privacy</strong>, which involves the handling and protection of sensitive personal information provided by customers in the course of everyday transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Global health security</strong>, how strong and resilient is our public health system, which should be able to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, wherever they occur in the world? </p>
<p><strong>Election security</strong>, the heart of our democracy is the protection of elections and the voting infrastructure, keeping it safe from cyberattack or cyber threat – including the tampering with or infiltration of voting machines and equipment, election office networks and practices, and voter registration databases. Election security also includes voter suppression and the efforts to erase voting rights for millions of people, which has escalated across the country.</p>
<p><strong>Community policing</strong>, or community-oriented policing (COP), a strategy of policing that focuses on developing relationships with community members. The central goal of community policing is for police to build relationships with the community, including through local agencies to reduce social disorder.  STN coverage news coverage will also include Police misconduct, referring to inappropriate conduct and illegal actions taken by police officers in connection with their official duties, and America’s commitment to justice.</p>
<p><strong>National security</strong>, the security and defense of the United States, including its citizens, economy, and institutions, which is regarded as a duty of government. This includes defense, arms control, nuclear proliferation, military families, space force, immigration &amp; border security, among other aspects of protection.</p>
<p><strong>Diplomacy or International Relations</strong>, the practice of influencing the decisions and conduct of foreign governments or intergovernmental organizations through discussion, negotiation, and other nonviolent more thoughtful means.</p>
<p><strong>Global action on Global Threats</strong>, the global challenges facing the United States—from climate change and mass migration to technological disruption and infectious diseases—have grown more complex and more urgent, while the rapid advance of authoritarianism, nationalism, and illiberalism has undermined our ability to collectively meet them. </p>
<p><strong>Violence against women (VAW)</strong>, also known as gender-based violence and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), which are violent acts primarily or exclusively committed against women or girls. Such violence is often considered a form of hate crime, committed against women or girls specifically because they are female.</p>
<p><strong>Hate Crimes</strong>, a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias. For the purposes of collecting statistics, the FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.” Hate itself is not a crime—and the FBI is mindful of protecting freedom of speech and other civil liberties.</p>
<p><strong>Drug-related crime</strong>, possession, manufacture, or distribution of drugs among so many other topics of concern to citizens. It’s time to re-balance these citizen concerns with long-form investigative journalism – giving stories the air time they deserve!</p>

<p>Apart from establishing our own in-house journalism staff, STN has a significant partnering opportunity with CNN.</p>
<p>VIDEO AFFILIATE NETWORK (VAN)</p>
<p>STN was invited to partner with CNN, the world’s digital news video leader, in a reciprocal agreement and join its one-stop digital video syndication platform that is built with newsrooms and digital news publishers in mind. The platform leads with what’s most important to its partners: great content by trusted news publishers.  CNN Newsource’s Video Affiliate Network (VAN) is a powerful digital video syndication network focused exclusively on quality news and lifestyle video from CNN and its trusted affiliates. The CNN advantage for STN is enormous as we have an opportunity to combine our in-house journalism efforts with CNNs unparalleled footprint.  </p>
<p>With access to the largest news gathering footprint in the market, CNN has 1,000+ news partners across broadcast, radio, newspaper and digital. Their regional news gathering team brings in more regional news than any other network, often by 3 or 4 times. With 36 domestic and international editorial operations, CNN Newsource is the industry’s most powerful newsgathering resource and North America’s most widely-distributed syndicated news service.</p>
<p>CNN Newsource will enable STN to specifically select and focus on their security niche content as a supplement to our own journalism and broadcasting staff.  With 24-hour digital distribution and eleven live digital satellite channels to create a compelling STN Newscast, collaborate on stories as they develop, and gather news that matters to our collective audience.  This afford STN premium reach on its platform, while profiting from its advertising revenue share model, powerful video content, and flexible technology.</p>
<p><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></p>
<p>CNN Newsource Digital, an affordable, end-to-end solution built for digital news publishers. CNN Newsource curates content from CNN, local affiliates and select content partners. CNN Newsource sells advertising against this video inventory and shares revenue with participating affiliates. The more VAN video published, the more revenue earned. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625775002/pbivitu2mawzojl0hfnc.png"" src=""""/>VAN is available exclusively for CNN Newsource affiliates and select distribution partners. VAN video is continuously updated and curated with content that cover the big stories each day across news, lifestyle and entertainment. VAN affiliates generate revenue by publishing VAN video across their website (pre-sold by CNN Newsource) as well as distributing their own video content through the VAN platform. VAN’s flexible video player and technology platform offers a variety of options for publishing, distribution and content management. Affiliates also have access to Newsource expertise on best practices for optimal performance and monetization.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625775073/brtmttttxlowmlmnybqd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As this opportunity relates to security business news, and financial market coverage, STN can provide niche programming coverage to an industry long overdue.  As an example, the market size of the security services industry alone in the United States has increased steadily since 2011, reaching a value of approximately 49.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. Despite the economic effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19), the industry is expected to continually increase by 0.2 percent in 2021 (Published by Statista Research Department, Mar 30, 2021).  On a global scale, the cyber security market size was valued at USD 156.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.0% from 2020 to 2027(Grand View Research).  </p>
<p>While growth is significant, the market, however, is becoming saturated, raising  marketability concerns, which drive increasing cost in marketing campaigns.  We, however, see this as a significant opportunity to provide visibility to important business stories, as the security industry is constantly evolving with new and evolving threats, technology, and business opportunities.  STN will aggregate, deliver, and produce the business stories that are so important to today’s citizens, while earning/sharing revenue.</p>

<p><strong>SOCIALIVE multi-year software license</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625776522/kdbc27qa2gwxei1rengh.png"" src=""""/>Video Production Requires Time, Money, and Expertise</p>
<p>Socialive makes it refreshingly easy to capture, create, and distribute video across multiple platforms — giving every team the power to connect more authentically with customers and employees. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625776580/pgqrcmlocsgoplk00b6h.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Socialive simplifies video content creation, and  because the case studies confirm the cost savings to produce video, STN is also going to take advantage of these cost savings.  Below is an example of how POLITICO saved money and time in its video production.</p>
<p>Staying On Top Of A Fast-Paced News Cycle</p>
<p>To harness the power of the newsroom and equip its audience with impactful information, POLITICO transitioned from live to virtual events. The Events team looked for a video creation platform to help them keep up with a dizzying news cycle. In search of a flexible solution tailored to their video needs, they encountered several problems:</p>
<p>High video production time, cost, and complexity</p>
<p>Inability to integrate with POLITICO’s product and teams</p>
<p>Low production value</p>
<p>Lack of customization</p>
<p>In addition to figuring out how to efficiently package and distribute video content, the team simplified their end-to-end video workflow and scaled video creation with its existing resources. In an era of social distancing, it was also key to land on a solution built for team collaboration.</p>
<p>Best practices, feedback, quality control.  STN journalist would be enabled to capture video in the field, and it appears instantly in a central library for review, refinement, and sharing out.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625776548/t8xecmcvhyvcmfmjdo3n.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>
<strong>FUTURE</strong> API INTEGRATION</h2>
<p><strong>Website Development</strong></p>
<p>The STN website Beta is now complete.  With the exceptional growth in the telecommunication sector, news is shared almost instantly, a capability that STN must share. The news website for the current generation requires more features than just posting and sharing the news.</p>
<p>Ongoing website development will give it the technological freedom to rapidly speed up the process of integrating it with an open application programming interface (API), connecting between other computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.  STN will use them for everything, from niche topics to creating the next big general news platform, and connecting its platform to partner networks like Socialive, cVent for webinars, and Wistia to launch STN Radio.</p>
<p><strong>Personnel Salaries</strong></p>
<p>The hiring process begins by identifying a need within your organization. STN has identified the following needs for its organization: </p>
<p>(1) Virtual Assistant (Part-time) - A virtual assistant is generally self-employed and provides professional administrative, technical, or creative assistance to clients remotely from a home office.</p>
<p>(1) Digital Media Manager (Full-Time) - A digital marketing manager is responsible for developing, implementing and managing marketing campaigns that promote a company and its products and/or services. He or she plays a major role in enhancing brand awareness within the digital space as well as driving website traffic and acquiring leads/customers.</p>
<p>(2) Journalist  (Part-Time) - An individual trained to collect/gather information in form of text, audio or pictures, processes them to a news-worth form and disseminates it to the public.</p>
<p>(1) TV/Radio Broadcasters (Part-Time) - Broadcast journalists research, investigate and present news and current affairs content for television, radio and the internet.</p>
<h2><strong>PRODUCTION</strong></h2>
<p><strong>STN Studio</strong></p>
<p>Building an in-house video studio can be a very expensive endeavor.  While the evidence is clear that a virtual in-home studio did work initially for the STN Beta, it's no longer sustainable as a primary production studio.  Additionally, while renting studio time is a short-term solution, our long-term goal serves the growth and talent advantage of the employment base in Arizona.  Maricopa County is in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The area boasts major employers such as Axon, Norton Lifelock, Amazon, KPMG, Securitas, the City of Phoenix, and several financial companies including American Express, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.</p>
<p>It's home to the Center of the Future of War at Arizona State University, Johnson Controls, and  several local businesses ranging from mom-and-pop country stores to well-known national retailers, giving the city a true Hometown, USA feel. This is especially important for STN as it will strive to become a part of the employment base of opportunities in the Phoenix metro, which has a population of nearly five million people.</p>
<p>In these conditions, its clear to us that the hassle of scheduling a shoot, booking a studio, and traveling to the location was a short-term solution.  STN goal is to own its on-site studio, meaning no setup and teardown time; the space is always ready to use at our convenience. This provides great peace of mind for executives, who often have to go live at a moment’s notice. For the marketing team, this provides a whole new level of creative control.</p>
<p>STN will use a  dedicated video studio to interview executives, broadcast news and radio, stream product demos, webinars, employee addresses, and much more.</p>
<p>While STN specializes in “breaking stories about victims, criminals, justice, security business and financial market news.”  Its content will be in the form of documentaries, specials, security tradeshows, webinars, and RealityTV, Court TV Cases, among other types of productions.  STN currently partners with multiple producers and security related production houses for content and we aim to increase these partnerships, while producing STN content in-house.  Below is an example of our current library.</p>

<h2><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact of Your Support</span></h2>
</div>
</div>
</div><div>
<p>Your support is critical to fuel our continued existence and growth strategy.</p>
<p>Apart from strategic use of social media as a growth strategy, partnering with platforms like CNN, and the global distribution of news stories that matter, your customer experience is our #1 growth mechanism, and it will be the primary reason for our success.  STN understands the power entrusted with the freedom of the press, and it’s this principle of communication and expression, which should be considered a right to be exercised freely.  At the same time, freedom of the press comes with substantial responsibility.</p>
<p>When peeling back the layers of this responsibility, as we do with each investigative story, getting to the core of a story is what readers seek. Readers want reporters to go beyond the basic elements of the story. STN will regularly take a  critical look at its reporting and make sure it attempts to fully explore all aspects of the story. This might include explaining background information, providing context beyond the facts of the latest update, and taking an investigative approach whenever possible.</p>
<p>STN will address terminology, particularly as it relates to new issues and concerns like cybersecurity, artificial intelligence among so many other newer Internet related Technology fields, which thoroughly require taking a step back and thinking about whether the average reader would have a full understanding of all the terms in a story. This not only applies to journalistic terms and procedures that are part of your everyday vocabulary, but not entirely familiar to your entire audience, but also extends to the industries discussed in your story. To help with this concern, STN will consider breaking down a story into its detail, utilizing more long-form vs soundbite news delivery, accounting for the processes and procedures associated with the story in addition to avoiding industry jargon.</p>
<p>Because readers don’t have an inside look at STNs reporting process, it's unclear to them why STN ended up with certain interviews and not others, who declined to speak, or who did not answer your request for an interview. This is part of a more significant issue where readers often associate this with a perceived imbalance in the reporting. STN will include a variety of voices in the story and/or balance stories with opposing counter stories, perhaps more importantly, to explain why certain voices were chosen and why others were left out or unavailable.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are so many questions about bias centered on the journalists’ motivations, possible affiliation with the subject of the story, among other overall angles. One way STN will guard against perceived bias is to provide a statement of independence that makes it clear that STN and/or its journalist has no relationship with story sources. STN will also clarify key information about how and why the story was reported. The bottom line, STN Readers will always have questions and there are countless ways STN will go about addressing these concerns. However, as the founder of STN, Dr. James Hall’s mission is that each STN journalist considers Edward R. Murrow in this regard, an American broadcast journalist and war correspondent who gained prominence during World War II.  He delivered live radio broadcasts from Europe for the news division of CBS, and was considered one of journalism’s greatest figures, noting his honesty and integrity in delivering the news.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are multiple obstacles STN will face on the way to achieving its goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2019, the failure rate of startups was around 90%.  Research concludes 21.5% of startups fail in the first year, 30% in the second year, 50% in the fifth year, and 70% in their 10th year.</li>
<li>According to business owners, reasons for failure include money running out, being in the wrong market, a lack of research, bad partnerships, ineffective marketing, and not being an expert in the industry.</li>
<li>The ways to avoid failing include setting goals, accurate research, loving the work, and not quitting.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><i>Please know this about the founder and CEO of STN, if I don't have the answer I will find out who does.  I will surround myself with people who are a hell of a-lot smarter than myself, and work tirelessly to provide the best quality of news available.</i></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm a military veteran, leader and founder of emerging video platform, the Security Television Network (STN), which excels at digital media, social media, marketing campaigns, operations, leadership, managing technical teams, working closely with internal/external stakeholders, video, its storage, and distribution.  Both strategic and tactical, Dr. James Hall has a strong focus on delivering results, and leading a group into “click, follow, and engagement infamy.”</p>

</div></div>","Security Television Network (STN) specializes in “breaking stories about victims, criminals, justice, security business and financial market news.” STN is the world's first television channel to provide 24-hour security news coverage -- poised to shape the future of security communication.
Before I share more about the channel, it’s fair that you should know something about who is bringing this Indiegogo campaign to you for support.  Here is a fact, we’re ready to deliver to you a service that I believe every informed citizen needs, and should become familiar with our start-up, the worlds first 24-hour security news channel. 
Our great country is being challenged by those who choose to divide us by race, political ideology, and the right of a collective people to feel secure. 
The second paragraph of the United States Declaration of Independence, however, lets us know and we shall remember that: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, and that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.  While these words and ideals are enshrined in our collective culture as Americans, we’re blitzed by sensational and exploitative soundbite news, the nationalization of media, thousands of news outlets with varying levels of quality and integrity, and what appears to remain are ideological debates, which fail to embrace the promise of a shared destiny.   While I’m hopeful, it’s clear our common stories that unite and connect us as people, are under siege.
America, is where I was born and raised.  I grew-up living on the fence line of a strawberry farm in Norwich, CT.  Life quickly changed, however, when my mother, a single mom of five children, became one of the first women welders at General Dynamics, working night shifts in subzero temperatures to weld the hull of a “Trident” nuclear submarine. Since this time, I became well aware of what it would take to keep a country safe, and how the creation of might can be a deterrent to war, not invite war.  The Big Stick Ideology by, President Theodore Roosevelt’s foreign policy: ""speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far.""
STN news coverage will include:
Gun Violence Epidemic, Full disclosure, the founder of STN, Dr. James Hall, joined the NRA before he became a teenager, raised on the belief that owning a gun is an American value. He grew up hunting and fishing but no longer has an interest in shooting animals.  Today, his values of safety and gun ownership are challenged by gun violence, which is a public health epidemic. Many innocent people died as a result of firearm injuries every year in the United States, while so many others are wounded. How do we balance these competing values of safe gun ownership and the gun violence epidemic?  It’s time to move past single events, dig deeper into the root cause(s) of this epidemic, and deliver the long-form news to allow for real-change.  In fact, 39,707 Americans died from gun violence in 2019. This equates to over 3,300 gun deaths each month, over 763 gun deaths a week, and nearly 109 people killed with guns every day. The numbers are staggering, and we must never forget that behind them are very real stories of people with stories of their own.  Individuals who are no longer with us because of a preventable tragedy.
Domestic terrorism, Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.
International terrorism,﻿ Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and/or groups who are inspired by, or associated with, designated foreign terrorist organizations or nations (state-sponsored).

Election security also includes voter suppression and the efforts to erase voting rights for millions of people, which has escalated across the country.
Community policing, or community-oriented policing (COP), a strategy of policing that focuses on developing relationships with community members. The central goal of community policing is for police to build relationships with the community, including through local agencies to reduce social disorder.  STN coverage news coverage will also include Police misconduct, referring to inappropriate conduct and illegal actions taken by police officers in connection with their official duties, and America’s commitment to justice.

Hate Crimes, a traditional offense like murder, arson, or vandalism with an added element of bias. For the purposes of collecting statistics, the FBI has defined a hate crime as a “criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.” Hate itself is not a crime—and the FBI is mindful of protecting freedom of speech and other civil liberties.
Drug-related crime, possession, manufacture, or distribution of drugs among so many other topics of concern to citizens. It’s time to re-balance these citizen concerns with long-form investigative journalism – giving stories the air time they deserve!

PARTNERS
CNN VAN multi-year license

Apart from establishing our own in-house journalism staff, STN has a significant partnering opportunity with CNN.
VIDEO AFFILIATE NETWORK (VAN)
STN was invited to partner with CNN, the world’s digital news video leader, in a reciprocal agreement and join its one-stop digital video syndication platform that is built with newsrooms and digital news publishers in mind. The platform leads with what’s most important to its partners: great content by trusted news publishers.  CNN Newsource’s Video Affiliate Network (VAN) is a powerful digital video syndication network focused exclusively on quality news and lifestyle video from CNN and its trusted affiliates. The CNN advantage for STN is enormous as we have an opportunity to combine our in-house journalism efforts with CNNs unparalleled footprint.  
With access to the largest news gathering footprint in the market, CNN has 1,000+ news partners across broadcast, radio, newspaper and digital. Their regional news gathering team brings in more regional news than any other network, often by 3 or 4 times. With 36 domestic and international editorial operations, CNN Newsource is the industry’s most powerful newsgathering resource and North America’s most widely-distributed syndicated news service.
CNN Newsource will enable STN to specifically select and focus on their security niche content as a supplement to our own journalism and broadcasting staff.  With 24-hour digital distribution and eleven live digital satellite channels to create a compelling STN Newscast, collaborate on stories as they develop, and gather news that matters to our collective audience.  This afford STN premium reach on its platform, while profiting from its advertising revenue share model, powerful video content, and flexible technology.
HOW IT WORKS
CNN Newsource Digital, an affordable, end-to-end solution built for digital news publishers. CNN Newsource curates content from CNN, local affiliates and select content partners. CNN Newsource sells advertising against this video inventory and shares revenue with participating affiliates. The more VAN video published, the more revenue earned. 
VAN is available exclusively for CNN Newsource affiliates and select distribution partners. VAN video is continuously updated and curated with content that cover the big stories each day across news, lifestyle and entertainment. VAN affiliates generate revenue by publishing VAN video across their website (pre-sold by CNN Newsource) as well as distributing their own video content through the VAN platform. VAN’s flexible video player and technology platform offers a variety of options for publishing, distribution and content management. Affiliates also have access to Newsource expertise on best practices for optimal performance and monetization.

As this opportunity relates to security business news, and financial market coverage, STN can provide niche programming coverage to an industry long overdue.  As an example, the market size of the security services industry alone in the United States has increased steadily since 2011, reaching a value of approximately 49.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. Despite the economic effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19), the industry is expected to continually increase by 0.2 percent in 2021 (Published by Statista Research Department, Mar 30, 2021).  On a global scale, the cyber security market size was valued at USD 156.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.0% from 2020 to 2027(Grand View Research).  
While growth is significant, the market, however, is becoming saturated, raising  marketability concerns, which drive increasing cost in marketing campaigns.  We, however, see this as a significant opportunity to provide visibility to important business stories, as the security industry is constantly evolving with new and evolving threats, technology, and business opportunities.  STN will aggregate, deliver, and produce the business stories that are so important to today’s citizens, while earning/sharing revenue.

SOCIALIVE multi-year software license
Video Production Requires Time, Money, and Expertise
Socialive makes it refreshingly easy to capture, create, and distribute video across multiple platforms — giving every team the power to connect more authentically with customers and employees. 

Socialive simplifies video content creation, and  because the case studies confirm the cost savings to produce video, STN is also going to take advantage of these cost savings.  Below is an example of how POLITICO saved money and time in its video production.
Staying On Top Of A Fast-Paced News Cycle
To harness the power of the newsroom and equip its audience with impactful information, POLITICO transitioned from live to virtual events. The Events team looked for a video creation platform to help them keep up with a dizzying news cycle. In search of a flexible solution tailored to their video needs, they encountered several problems:
High video production time, cost, and complexity
Inability to integrate with POLITICO’s product and teams
Low production value
Lack of customization
In addition to figuring out how to efficiently package and distribute video content, the team simplified their end-to-end video workflow and scaled video creation with its existing resources. In an era of social distancing, it was also key to land on a solution built for team collaboration.
Best practices, feedback, quality control.  STN journalist would be enabled to capture video in the field, and it appears instantly in a central library for review, refinement, and sharing out.

 

FUTURE API INTEGRATION
Website Development
The STN website Beta is now complete.  With the exceptional growth in the telecommunication sector, news is shared almost instantly, a capability that STN must share. The news website for the current generation requires more features than just posting and sharing the news.
Ongoing website development will give it the technological freedom to rapidly speed up the process of integrating it with an open application programming interface (API), connecting between other computers or between computer programs. It is a type of software interface, offering a service to other pieces of software.  STN will use them for everything, from niche topics to creating the next big general news platform, and connecting its platform to partner networks like Socialive, cVent for webinars, and Wistia to launch STN Radio.
Personnel Salaries
The hiring process begins by identifying a need within your organization. STN has identified the following needs for its organization: 
(1) Virtual Assistant (Part-time) - A virtual assistant is generally self-employed and provides professional administrative, technical, or creative assistance to clients remotely from a home office.
(1) Digital Media Manager (Full-Time) - A digital marketing manager is responsible for developing, implementing and managing marketing campaigns that promote a company and its products and/or services. He or she plays a major role in enhancing brand awareness within the digital space as well as driving website traffic and acquiring leads/customers.
(2) Journalist  (Part-Time) - An individual trained to collect/gather information in form of text, audio or pictures, processes them to a news-worth form and disseminates it to the public.
(1) TV/Radio Broadcasters (Part-Time) - Broadcast journalists research, investigate and present news and current affairs content for television, radio and the internet.
PRODUCTION
STN Studio
Building an in-house video studio can be a very expensive endeavor.  While the evidence is clear that a virtual in-home studio did work initially for the STN Beta, it's no longer sustainable as a primary production studio.  Additionally, while renting studio time is a short-term solution, our long-term goal serves the growth and talent advantage of the employment base in Arizona.  Maricopa County is in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The area boasts major employers such as Axon, Norton Lifelock, Amazon, KPMG, Securitas, the City of Phoenix, and several financial companies including American Express, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.
It's home to the Center of the Future of War at Arizona State University, Johnson Controls, and  several local businesses ranging from mom-and-pop country stores to well-known national retailers, giving the city a true Hometown, USA feel. This is especially important for STN as it will strive to become a part of the employment base of opportunities in the Phoenix metro, which has a population of nearly five million people.
In these conditions, its clear to us that the hassle of scheduling a shoot, booking a studio, and traveling to the location was a short-term solution.  STN goal is to own its on-site studio, meaning no setup and teardown time; the space is always ready to use at our convenience. This provides great peace of mind for executives, who often have to go live at a moment’s notice. For the marketing team, this provides a whole new level of creative control.
STN will use a  dedicated video studio to interview executives, broadcast news and radio, stream product demos, webinars, employee addresses, and much more.
While STN specializes in “breaking stories about victims, criminals, justice, security business and financial market news.”  Its content will be in the form of documentaries, specials, security tradeshows, webinars, and RealityTV, Court TV Cases, among other types of productions.  STN currently partners with multiple producers and security related production houses for content and we aim to increase these partnerships, while producing STN content in-house.  Below is an example of our current library.

FROM WAR TO WISDOM

 
If STN does not reach its entire budget goal, we will prioritize what funds we receive in the following order.  We would first solidify the CNN VAN partnership, and license the SOCIALIVE software to allow for the production of in-house news.  Thereafter, we would deliver on website development at a slower pace, continuing to plow all profits back into the company for maximum growth.

 
Our Budget:
Priority #1 $21,600 : CNN VAN multi-year license
Priority #2 $18,000 : SOCIALIVE multi-year software license
Priority #3 $116,000: Website Development
Priority #4 $124,800: Personnel Salaries
Priority #5 $360,000: STN Studio
The Impact of Your Support



Your support is critical to fuel our continued existence and growth strategy.
Apart from strategic use of social media as a growth strategy, partnering with platforms like CNN, and the global distribution of news stories that matter, your customer experience is our #1 growth mechanism, and it will be the primary reason for our success.  STN understands the power entrusted with the freedom of the press, and it’s this principle of communication and expression, which should be considered a right to be exercised freely.  At the same time, freedom of the press comes with substantial responsibility.
When peeling back the layers of this responsibility, as we do with each investigative story, getting to the core of a story is what readers seek. Readers want reporters to go beyond the basic elements of the story. STN will regularly take a  critical look at its reporting and make sure it attempts to fully explore all aspects of the story. This might include explaining background information, providing context beyond the facts of the latest update, and taking an investigative approach whenever possible.
STN will address terminology, particularly as it relates to new issues and concerns like cybersecurity, artificial intelligence among so many other newer Internet related Technology fields, which thoroughly require taking a step back and thinking about whether the average reader would have a full understanding of all the terms in a story. This not only applies to journalistic terms and procedures that are part of your everyday vocabulary, but not entirely familiar to your entire audience, but also extends to the industries discussed in your story. To help with this concern, STN will consider breaking down a story into its detail, utilizing more long-form vs soundbite news delivery, accounting for the processes and procedures associated with the story in addition to avoiding industry jargon.
Because readers don’t have an inside look at STNs reporting process, it's unclear to them why STN ended up with certain interviews and not others, who declined to speak, or who did not answer your request for an interview. This is part of a more significant issue where readers often associate this with a perceived imbalance in the reporting. STN will include a variety of voices in the story and/or balance stories with opposing counter stories, perhaps more importantly, to explain why certain voices were chosen and why others were left out or unavailable.
Furthermore, there are so many questions about bias centered on the journalists’ motivations, possible affiliation with the subject of the story, among other overall angles. One way STN will guard against perceived bias is to provide a statement of independence that makes it clear that STN and/or its journalist has no relationship with story sources. STN will also clarify key information about how and why the story was reported. The bottom line, STN Readers will always have questions and there are countless ways STN will go about addressing these concerns. However, as the founder of STN, Dr. James Hall’s mission is that each STN journalist considers Edward R. Murrow in this regard, an American broadcast journalist and war correspondent who gained prominence during World War II.  He delivered live radio broadcasts from Europe for the news division of CBS, and was considered one of journalism’s greatest figures, noting his honesty and integrity in delivering the news.

Risks & Challenges
There are multiple obstacles STN will face on the way to achieving its goals:

In 2019, the failure rate of startups was around 90%.  Research concludes 21.5% of startups fail in the first year, 30% in the second year, 50% in the fifth year, and 70% in their 10th year.
According to business owners, reasons for failure include money running out, being in the wrong market, a lack of research, bad partnerships, ineffective marketing, and not being an expert in the industry.
The ways to avoid failing include setting goals, accurate research, loving the work, and not quitting.

Please know this about the founder and CEO of STN, if I don't have the answer I will find out who does.  I will surround myself with people who are a hell of a-lot smarter than myself, and work tirelessly to provide the best quality of news available.
 
I'm a military veteran, leader and founder of emerging video platform, the Security Television Network (STN), which excels at digital media, social media, marketing campaigns, operations, leadership, managing technical teams, working closely with internal/external stakeholders, video, its storage, and distribution.  Both strategic and tactical, Dr. James Hall has a strong focus on delivering results, and leading a group into “click, follow, and engagement infamy.”
 
“Let's Do Big Things together, please join STN…?

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We've already been so lucky with our first two crowdfunding campaigns that allowed us to <strong>producer a 60 second teaser in lockdown</strong> and then a <strong>3 day shoot to film our sizzle reel</strong>. This also allowed us to commission a <strong>10 page comic book </strong>set in the world of ""Origins of the Laoich"".</p>
<p>The series so far has support from <strong>Debbie Moon </strong>(Wolfblood creator and BAFTA winning writer) who is serving as <strong>Executive Producer</strong> along with an <strong>international producer </strong>helping us reach contacts and production companies outwith the UK to help give us the best shot possible at getting the show off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Holly Jack </strong>(River City) and <strong>Simon Weir </strong>(Trainspotting 2) star as Éithne, our Pict Goddess and Laoich and Alasdair Bàn respectively, joining <strong>Innes Anderson </strong>as Effie Dwyer, <strong>Ellen Patterson </strong>as her cousin, Avril, <strong>Gordon J Millar </strong>as Effie's Dad, Gregor, <strong>Jamie Stewart </strong>as the unfortunate dog walker, Cromwell Forsyth, and <strong>Rebecca Turner </strong>as The Bean-Nighe.</p>
<p><strong>Strike Fight Company </strong>staged our two big fight scenes for our sizzle reel, <strong>Gibbet FX </strong>created our Bean-Nighe monster makeup, <strong>Scare Scotland</strong> provided us with support for Rebecca's performance as the Bean-Nighe and <strong>Hands On Productions</strong> provided us with accurate props and weapons for our shoot. <b>Progressive Broadcast Scotland</b> provided us with equipment to shoot on and these are just a few of the amazing people that helped make our sizzle reel a reality, backing our incredible cast and crew.</p>
<p>This provided work during lockdown for many creatives who were struggling and found themselves with no support during the pandemic. You kept us creative, you kept us optimistic and you kept us going. </p>
<p>Now we're hoping to do it one more time with our poster campaign. If we hit £500, we can commission an artist to create our poster, then package our teaser trailer, sizzle reel, series bible, pilot script all together and help us pitch our show. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627987690/q6arlru0wjegrdf3jwiq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>So far we've ran two IndieGoGo campaigns to get ""Origins of the Laoich"" off the ground - first we produced a 60 second teaser in lockdown, creating it entirely with visual effects, music, voice over artists and sound effects. We commissioned Scottish artist David Fergusson to create concept art of our monsters and characters as well.</p>
<p>The 2nd, bigger campaign, allowed us to shoot for 3 days and create our 16 minute sizzle reel, we found an international producer to come on board and Wolfblood creator Debbie Moon joined us as Executive Producer, bringing a wealth of experience to the writing team of <strong>Fraser Coull and James T Harding</strong>. </p>
<p>We were also able to commission a 10 page comic book, which is currently being written and will be penned by David Fergusson. </p>
<p>It's a risk running a third campaign but we believe that along with our <strong>pilot script</strong>, <strong>sizzle reel, script bible </strong>and now an exciting <strong>eye catching poster</strong>, we can create an original, dynamic brand that streamers won't be able to say no to! </p>

The series so far has support from Debbie Moon (Wolfblood creator and BAFTA winning writer) who is serving as Executive Producer along with an international producer helping us reach contacts and production companies outwith the UK to help give us the best shot possible at getting the show off the ground.
Holly Jack (River City) and Simon Weir (Trainspotting 2) star as Éithne, our Pict Goddess and Laoich and Alasdair Bàn respectively, joining Innes Anderson as Effie Dwyer, Ellen Patterson as her cousin, Avril, Gordon J Millar as Effie's Dad, Gregor, Jamie Stewart as the unfortunate dog walker, Cromwell Forsyth, and Rebecca Turner as The Bean-Nighe.
Strike Fight Company staged our two big fight scenes for our sizzle reel, Gibbet FX created our Bean-Nighe monster makeup, Scare Scotland provided us with support for Rebecca's performance as the Bean-Nighe and Hands On Productions provided us with accurate props and weapons for our shoot. Progressive Broadcast Scotland provided us with equipment to shoot on and these are just a few of the amazing people that helped make our sizzle reel a reality, backing our incredible cast and crew.
This provided work during lockdown for many creatives who were struggling and found themselves with no support during the pandemic. You kept us creative, you kept us optimistic and you kept us going. 
Now we're hoping to do it one more time with our poster campaign. If we hit £500, we can commission an artist to create our poster, then package our teaser trailer, sizzle reel, series bible, pilot script all together and help us pitch our show. 


Risks & Challenges
So far we've ran two IndieGoGo campaigns to get ""Origins of the Laoich"" off the ground - first we produced a 60 second teaser in lockdown, creating it entirely with visual effects, music, voice over artists and sound effects. We commissioned Scottish artist David Fergusson to create concept art of our monsters and characters as well.
The 2nd, bigger campaign, allowed us to shoot for 3 days and create our 16 minute sizzle reel, we found an international producer to come on board and Wolfblood creator Debbie Moon joined us as Executive Producer, bringing a wealth of experience to the writing team of Fraser Coull and James T Harding. 
We were also able to commission a 10 page comic book, which is currently being written and will be penned by David Fergusson. 
It's a risk running a third campaign but we believe that along with our pilot script, sizzle reel, script bible and now an exciting eye catching poster, we can create an original, dynamic brand that streamers won't be able to say no to!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Von-Anise McCoy. I'm the creator and star of Bougie Betty, which is a web-series about a girl from Harlem who believes that a Master's degree and self-help books will make her more refined like her idol, Michelle Obama. However, no matter how much she tries to be pulled-in and sophisticated, when faced with a conflict ""the hood"" always rears its ugly head. How do you become the better version of yourself, walking around this earth, if crazy people are always creating problems with you?  Nina McKay has been asking herself this question ever since the first time bullies uttered the words ""She think, she cute!"" </p>
<p> We go on a journey with Nina as she strives for the fabulous life, which she believes her education has afforded her, while her sister Kim helps her to recognize that having balance is key. We see that sisterhood, is an important relationship in ones life which provides the check- and-balance. </p>
<p> This is my story: as a teen I was bullied, so I was always angry and defensive as a young adult. I saw myself in the characters on reality tv shows, who always lashed out verbally or physical.  </p>

<p>We'll need $27,476 to complete Season 1 of Bougie Betty episodes (2-5) </p>

<h2>GIABW - My Truth</h2>
<p>As 2020, was in full effect, I found myself leaning into my spirituality more than ever before. My name is Chaz Shermil Hodges and like most of America, I found myself at an extreme low during the pandemic. The isolation, race wars, and fractured justice system had me in a tizzy. Not to mention, the constant mental battles from seeing constant brutality bestowed upon black &amp; brown bodies. </p>
<p><i>I cried.</i></p>
<p><i>I contemplated suicide. </i></p>
<p><i>I died.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>God is a Black Woman</strong></i> is a public mourning of who and what we have been told we need to be as black women in American society. It is also a rebirth of every beautiful thing we have ever been. My wish is for you to support this story because it's one that we have been screaming to tell and yet, somehow no one ever hears.

<h3>BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY</h3>
<p>WOMEN ARE FUNNY. So. Freaking. Funny. And there are so many of us! So why do we keep seeing and hearing from the same handful of women over and over again?... Opportunity, Opportunity, <strong><i><u>OPPORTUNITY!</u></i> </strong>(That last one I hope you said out loud in Oprah's voice)</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a writer/ actress/ director who is completely inspired by all my incredibly talented female friends. We are all unique and beautiful, with stories and voices that, frankly, aren't being heard.</li>
<li>I'm also a person. Which means I have ""the Facebook"", and have noticed over the last few years it becoming more and more a marketplace to sell, well, EVERYTHING!</li>
<li>Soooooo I decided to write what I know, what perhaps EVERYONE who's on Facebook knows. That Multi Level Marketing is a great way to make money! But what if it's also an incredible way showcase talented women?? What if Social Media is the next frontier not just in selling your wares, but in selling yourself. Wait, not like that, like... like... your comedy self. In a LIVE scripted format????? </li>
<li>And YOU can be a part of providing THAT opportunity for HILARIOUS WOMEN, whilst bringing some serious laughter LIVE onto your Facebook Feed. It's basically a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich of joy!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Here's the thing, I can't do this alone (and believe me, I've tried)!!  I just humbly realized, it's better when you're honest with yourself and others and say ""WE ALL NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO CREATE MORE REPRESENTATION !!""</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you know BRIDESMAIDS' budget was 32.5 million dollars?!</li>
<li>Did you know ours is just 2,500 smackeroos? That may seem miniscule to a major studio, but to someone who is funding it all on their own, it's basically trying to come up with Scrooge McDuck's gold coin bank vault!</li>
<li>But what shall Scrooge's bank vault pay for you ask?! Welp -- Theater Rental, Rehearsal Space, Film Equipment, Props, Costumes and, of course, FOOD. That's right, I said food. Our actors are working on this project out of love (i.e. unpaid), AND because of this, we'd LOVE to make sure there is food for them during the shoot/ performance! It's the little things, like Peanut M&amp;M's that really show you care, unless they have a nut allergy. I should check on that...</li>
</ul>
</div><div>

WOMEN ARE FUNNY. So. Freaking. Funny. And there are so many of us! So why do we keep seeing and hearing from the same handful of women over and over again?... Opportunity, Opportunity, OPPORTUNITY! (That last one I hope you said out loud in Oprah's voice)

I'm a writer/ actress/ director who is completely inspired by all my incredibly talented female friends. We are all unique and beautiful, with stories and voices that, frankly, aren't being heard.
I'm also a person. Which means I have ""the Facebook"", and have noticed over the last few years it becoming more and more a marketplace to sell, well, EVERYTHING!
Soooooo I decided to write what I know, what perhaps EVERYONE who's on Facebook knows. That Multi Level Marketing is a great way to make money! But what if it's also an incredible way showcase talented women?? What if Social Media is the next frontier not just in selling your wares, but in selling yourself. Wait, not like that, like... like... your comedy self. In a LIVE scripted format????? 
And YOU can be a part of providing THAT opportunity for HILARIOUS WOMEN, whilst bringing some serious laughter LIVE onto your Facebook Feed. It's basically a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich of joy!


What We Need
Here's the thing, I can't do this alone (and believe me, I've tried)!!  I just humbly realized, it's better when you're honest with yourself and others and say ""WE ALL NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO CREATE MORE REPRESENTATION !!""

Did you know BRIDESMAIDS' budget was 32.5 million dollars?!
Did you know ours is just 2,500 smackeroos? That may seem miniscule to a major studio, but to someone who is funding it all on their own, it's basically trying to come up with Scrooge McDuck's gold coin bank vault!
But what shall Scrooge's bank vault pay for you ask?! Welp -- Theater Rental, Rehearsal Space, Film Equipment, Props, Costumes and, of course, FOOD. That's right, I said food. Our actors are working on this project out of love (i.e. unpaid), AND because of this, we'd LOVE to make sure there is food for them during the shoot/ performance! It's the little things, like Peanut M&M's that really show you care, unless they have a nut allergy. I should check on that...


WHAT YOU GET!
Oh besides the incredible feeling in your heart that you have allowed joy to spread across the world? Oh you want stuff, like things, experiences, fulfillment... I got you!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Morgan Elizabeth Millogo, and I have put together an incredible team of women to make the web series Tabs &amp; Clea. I have a BFA in Film and Television Production from NYU, have worked over 10 years in indie film in front of and behind the camera, am a former burlesque performer and emcee, and am a Certified Contemporary Shamanic Practitioner. All of these explored roads have led me to creating Tabs &amp; Clea. </p>
<p>Tabs &amp; Clea is an opportunity for me to bring together a community of women storytellers who want to share female centric stories and laugh and have fun while doing it. Everyone who works on this project receives support in creating their future projects as well, through the offering of talents from other members of the Tabs &amp; Clea team. </p>
<p>Contributions let the whole Tabs &amp; Clea team know that you are interested in female centric stories and support women artists and storytellers. This encouragement is HUGE! To know that women in central creator and power rolls will be supported by an audience, changes the independent film game. It also helps us create local work with local talent and support local businesses. We get to make our work on our terms, and we are all ready to soar! </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We need $2,000 to rent equipment to make this web series look and sound as good as possible for as affordable as possible. We don't need to rent a lot, but we do prefer to use equipment other than our phones. We have an excellent cinematographer, Rachael Saltzman, and no matter the budget, she will make it look good! However, having certain tools will help the shooting process go faster and look even better. </p>
<p>Our incentives are fun! I am an excellent Tarot card reader and for every donation, you will receive at least one Tarot card pulled by me with a focus on YOU. A picture of the card will be emailed to you, along with a description. With a $35 contribution or higher, you receive a hand picked crystal, courtesy of Voices of the Stone here in the Hudson Valley. Other incentives include some palo santo to do your own cleansing, a Tabs &amp; Clea tote bag, a special private link to the series before it's released with a Skype Q&amp;A with available cast and crew, and one lucky contributor will receive a featured extra role! </p>
<p>Whatever amount we raise will be used to get what we need to get this project made. We are working out the different levels of necessity and know how to spend wisely. Tabs &amp; Clea will be made! </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>There is a lot of content in the world, but not a lot of funny, complex, heartfelt, empowering stories about female friendships. You will be entertained by Tabs &amp; Clea, and you will feel good that you contributed to empowering women to work together to tell this story. Every female voice that speaks up with truth through art, or any form, makes our world better and stronger. Women and men banding together to let these voices rise changes how things have been done and paves a new path forward for us all. The smallest amount of support in any capacity makes a difference. </p>
<p>I see projects through until the end. In film school, I was given $800 and a video camera to make my thesis film, and I did! Over the years, I have worked on projects that never saw the light of day. My strengths include my resourcefulness along with my ability to make things happen despite any limitations. </p>
<p>Tabs &amp; Clea will be made with whatever contributions we receive. I will make it happen with what we raise. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest hurdle is equipment. However, we made the pitch video just using an iPhone, and my last resort scenario for the web series is to do the same. However, any amount of money raised will wisely be used to get the most efficient, effective and affordable equipment. Our cinematographer is aware that what we raise will be our budget, and she is prepared to problem solve the equipment riddle with whatever amount we have. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand if you are not able to make a monetary contribution at this time. That is ok! What we really want is for the word to get out about Tabs &amp; Clea and for people to watch it when it comes out in 2018! You can help us by liking our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tabsandclea"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a> page to keep up to date, and sharing our Indiegogo campaign! Indiegogo has sharing tools, so please feel free to use them! Sharing is the greatest form of supporting! </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to view our campaign! We hope you keep up to date on Tabs &amp; Clea and watch next year! THANK YOU!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Morgan Millogo</p>
<p>And the Tabs &amp; Clea Team! </p>

Whatever amount we raise will be used to get what we need to get this project made. We are working out the different levels of necessity and know how to spend wisely. Tabs & Clea will be made! 

The Impact
There is a lot of content in the world, but not a lot of funny, complex, heartfelt, empowering stories about female friendships. You will be entertained by Tabs & Clea, and you will feel good that you contributed to empowering women to work together to tell this story. Every female voice that speaks up with truth through art, or any form, makes our world better and stronger. Women and men banding together to let these voices rise changes how things have been done and paves a new path forward for us all. The smallest amount of support in any capacity makes a difference. 
I see projects through until the end. In film school, I was given $800 and a video camera to make my thesis film, and I did! Over the years, I have worked on projects that never saw the light of day. My strengths include my resourcefulness along with my ability to make things happen despite any limitations. 
Tabs & Clea will be made with whatever contributions we receive. I will make it happen with what we raise. 

Risks & Challenges
Our biggest hurdle is equipment. However, we made the pitch video just using an iPhone, and my last resort scenario for the web series is to do the same. However, any amount of money raised will wisely be used to get the most efficient, effective and affordable equipment. Our cinematographer is aware that what we raise will be our budget, and she is prepared to problem solve the equipment riddle with whatever amount we have. 

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand if you are not able to make a monetary contribution at this time. That is ok! What we really want is for the word to get out about Tabs & Clea and for people to watch it when it comes out in 2018! You can help us by liking our facebook page to keep up to date, and sharing our Indiegogo campaign! Indiegogo has sharing tools, so please feel free to use them! Sharing is the greatest form of supporting! 
Thank you for taking the time to view our campaign! We hope you keep up to date on Tabs & Clea and watch next year! THANK YOU!
Sincerely,
Morgan Millogo

</p>
<p>gypsi is an Original Supernatural television drama series that offers multiple meanings and story lines. It is an
entirely unique and new story-line, not based on any existing books or
previously aired publications, written by Angel and Mysti Cozart, that explores
the rich cultural mythology of southern voodoo in a fictional town in
southern Louisiana that has been hidden from the world through all phases of
mankind’s cultural and technological evolution. The series centers on the
adventures of gypsi lasalle, a carefree nomad who begins to feel a draw to
bring her home, to a place she’s never been before. </p>
<p><span><span>gypsi lasalle is an Adventurous free spirited witch who lives the life of a 
gypsy among the mortals. She is on the precipice of discovering that 
there is more to who she really is. Her journey will reveal how 
important she will become to the unknown, mysterious, mystical town in the bayou. As gypsi’s power begins to increase, so does the intensity of 
her dreams. A reoccurring cry for help from across centuries leads her 
back to a home and a town that she has no memory of. She will uncover 
that family ties can be more binding than the blood that flows through 
her veins. <br/></span></span></p> <ul>

<p>Why this web series and why now? Well, I'd be lying if I didn't mention I went through a rough breakup last year (long story, won't bore ya with the details but she's blocked on everything and hopefully she isn't looking at this campaign right now and if yes Hi!). This series is the fruit of that shit show. During that time, I got low. I found art to be a comforting source in understanding the universal human suffering that comes from the end of a seemingly happy relationship.  Music, movies, books, something to reach out and tell me everything will be alright. I wanted to create something that could help people feel better when a life change of this magnitude occurs and really explore why relationships end and what our exes mean to us when everything is over. And possibly understand relationships better. And also get some cheap laughs. Think of it as <i>Man Seeking Woman</i> by way of <i>Rick and Morty</i> and <i>Bojack Horseman</i>. </p>
<p>Somehow, writing this series, it helped me get back to normal. I was going to table it, slip into a drawer where no one could find it, but then I showed it to people. And they really, really liked it. It connected to a deep emotional level with others that I didn't know was possible. Now I want to share it with the world. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<li>Allowing us to make the best damn web series possible</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If this ends up making it, you can be on the ground floor of another breakout web series and boast to your friends ""Hey, I funded it before it was big!""

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've shot videos in high school on an old camcorder that took VHS tapes so it's been awhile. But I'm collaborating with people who frequently work on film sets (cast and crew included) and, to make the best product possible, I'll need the funds to hire some of the best crew to make this happen. There will also be a lot of complicated effects that will balloon the budget. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Get the word out! Talking about it makes this project come closer to reality! Plus, a super rich person might hear about it and that can fund this thing in one go. Also, consider joining the crew! Applications are welcome. </p>

<h3><strong>WHAT AND WHY ARE WE DOING?</strong></h3>
<p>It has been 41 years from famous and, by that – time standards unrepeatable Kragujevac to Kilimanjaro expedition when five old and famous Yugoslavian ""Zastava 101"" cars went through 11.000 km long journey from Kragujevac in Serbia to Kilimanjaro in Africa. Everybody said it’s unique and it cannot be repeated. We agree. But, regarding the technology nowadays, being inspired by this expedition, we decided to go a step further,  making another unrepeatable journey – driving from Belgrade, capital of Serbia, to Tokyo on the wings of sports spirits announcing the upcoming Olympic games in Tokyo. And to make things more interesting, we will do it using old - timer cars from countries that are mapped on our route.  It will be a convoy consisted of three old timer cars from Serbia (Zastava 101), Russia (Lada Niva), Japan (Honda), two motorbikes and fifteen expedition members supported by the worldwide media.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491427954/zik8nhttxvb47ell7xiy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our idea is to experience once in a lifetime journey meeting new people, making friendships, trying out various crazy and fun things, learning about different cultures, overcoming our fears and all of that in front of cameras in order to spread travel spirit and cultural tolerance to worldwide public.  We will make a series of episodes that will be a unique mixture of travel shows, reality, survivor and documentary programs but with our special twist because a real travel doesn’t reveal in discovering new landscapes, but in completely new, different perspective about the world and yourself. Besides that, we will create tons of various multimedia materials for social networks and internet that will be containing behind the scenes and unique moments revealing even more personal side of our journey and containing useful tips for travel and sightseeing of all of the countries on our route.</p>
<p><strong>You still doubt us? Or think we’re insane? Don’t doubt - yes we are!</strong> We can do this because we deeply believe that understanding other cultures and traditions is the first step in creating a healthy society and we’re going to bring it closer to you because we’re insane about travel, spreading good vibes and living life to the fullest.  Support our project and become a traveler, don’t be a tourist!</p>
<h3>WHERE ARE WE GOING?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491419484/glt8qrf2muhyuf6a1fri.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are going to drive 26.000km long journey across Europe and Asia. The idea is to start this Unforgettable journey in our hometown, Belgrade, capital of Serbia. On our route to north, until the Hungarian border we will stop in Novi Sad, the city of biggest Eastern – European music festival, Exit, and also a world capital of culture in 2012, and a few bigger cities in Serbia. After that, we will take you through the plains of Hungary and variety of their exotic cuisine, the imposing Slovakian mountains, almost infinite Polish forests and old cities with legends about heroes and dragons, through vast wilderness of Belarus and Russia, following the route of famous Transsiberian railway and enjoying incredible Russian nature and cities during the route. After that, we’re leaving Europe behind at very end of the Eurasian mainland – in Vladivostok and taking the ship to country of the rising sun – Japan, getting to know their worldwide unique traditions and rituals, driving right to the place where Olympic Games will be opened. When we reach that goal, to make the journey more interesting, we will go back to Serbia through South Korea, taking a boat to Beijing and then driving again across the plains and mountains of China and Kazakhstan. After that you will be travelling with us across the Caspian Sea and Azerbaijan deserts, climb with us on the peaks of the Caucasus in Georgia and take a dip in the Black sea, learning about old Turkish hedonistic culture in Istanbul, getting back to Europe. Then we’ll travel along the beautiful coast of Greece to Thessaloniki, via Macedonia and back to Serbia, to the southern border of our country again, where we’ll visit all the major cities to Belgrade, where we end our journey.</p>

<p>We are The Wonder Drifters! Young, but fully professional production with years of experience in filming, marketing and tourism. Our passion is simple, travel the world, meet new people, experience new cultures, explore the unknown and share our passion with everyone using our vast knowledge about video production, media and viral internet trends! Our goal is to offer to our clients, cooperators and, first of all, to our audience fun, dynamic, useful and innovative content that will motivate everyone to get out of their comfort zones, try something new, meet different cultures and become real travelers and Wonder Drifters, just like us.</p>
<h3><strong>WHY SHOULD WE GET YOUR SUPPORT?</strong></h3>
<p>       Because you're going to have so much fun and learn so many things watching twelve travel fanatics doing almost impossible expedition, offering you, as a viewer, tons of knowledge, fun, good vibes, and a chance to live a thousand lives just by watching our video material and who knows – maybe we'll inspire you with our experience and trips to visit these countries, or event better, to overcome your doubts and make your own expedition!</p>
<p>        Everyone knows that the countries of Eastern Europe and Asia are definitely among the countries with the richest and oldest cultures in the world, but many people don’t know enough about these countries because they are visiting mostly well-known classical touristic places. Our goal is to change focus. Is there a better way to taste the contrasts of the huge cultural diversity of these countries than going by car all the way to the Far East and back?</p>
<p>        Just imagine a recorded adventure from Serbia to Japan about the life of different people, beautiful landscapes and attractions on our way with a couple of pre-planned stops and tons of improvisational stops. Mountains, rivers, deepest and cleanest lakes, eleven time zones and two continents, churches, mosques, Buddhist temples, forests, taigas, seas, deserts ... all this in just one expedition! It is really an Unrepeatable journey! There are 26.000 kilometers and 26.000 reasons why we simply MUST GO on this epic journey.</p>

<p><strong>Why are you going with ""Flexible Funding"" on Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>We are using flexible funding for two reasons: <br/>1) Because we are going to make this travel show no matter what. <br/>2) Because we chose not to use PayPal. Although PayPal can be great, they have security measures built into their system that could freeze the account and lock the money away for long periods of time. Sadly, other people have had this problem in the past.<br/> </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","WHAT AND WHY ARE WE DOING?
It has been 41 years from famous and, by that – time standards unrepeatable Kragujevac to Kilimanjaro expedition when five old and famous Yugoslavian ""Zastava 101"" cars went through 11.000 km long journey from Kragujevac in Serbia to Kilimanjaro in Africa. Everybody said it’s unique and it cannot be repeated. We agree. But, regarding the technology nowadays, being inspired by this expedition, we decided to go a step further,  making another unrepeatable journey – driving from Belgrade, capital of Serbia, to Tokyo on the wings of sports spirits announcing the upcoming Olympic games in Tokyo. And to make things more interesting, we will do it using old - timer cars from countries that are mapped on our route.  It will be a convoy consisted of three old timer cars from Serbia (Zastava 101), Russia (Lada Niva), Japan (Honda), two motorbikes and fifteen expedition members supported by the worldwide media.

Our idea is to experience once in a lifetime journey meeting new people, making friendships, trying out various crazy and fun things, learning about different cultures, overcoming our fears and all of that in front of cameras in order to spread travel spirit and cultural tolerance to worldwide public.  We will make a series of episodes that will be a unique mixture of travel shows, reality, survivor and documentary programs but with our special twist because a real travel doesn’t reveal in discovering new landscapes, but in completely new, different perspective about the world and yourself. Besides that, we will create tons of various multimedia materials for social networks and internet that will be containing behind the scenes and unique moments revealing even more personal side of our journey and containing useful tips for travel and sightseeing of all of the countries on our route.
You still doubt us? Or think we’re insane? Don’t doubt - yes we are! We can do this because we deeply believe that understanding other cultures and traditions is the first step in creating a healthy society and we’re going to bring it closer to you because we’re insane about travel, spreading good vibes and living life to the fullest.  Support our project and become a traveler, don’t be a tourist!
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

We are going to drive 26.000km long journey across Europe and Asia. The idea is to start this Unforgettable journey in our hometown, Belgrade, capital of Serbia. On our route to north, until the Hungarian border we will stop in Novi Sad, the city of biggest Eastern – European music festival, Exit, and also a world capital of culture in 2012, and a few bigger cities in Serbia. After that, we will take you through the plains of Hungary and variety of their exotic cuisine, the imposing Slovakian mountains, almost infinite Polish forests and old cities with legends about heroes and dragons, through vast wilderness of Belarus and Russia, following the route of famous Transsiberian railway and enjoying incredible Russian nature and cities during the route. After that, we’re leaving Europe behind at very end of the Eurasian mainland – in Vladivostok and taking the ship to country of the rising sun – Japan, getting to know their worldwide unique traditions and rituals, driving right to the place where Olympic Games will be opened. When we reach that goal, to make the journey more interesting, we will go back to Serbia through South Korea, taking a boat to Beijing and then driving again across the plains and mountains of China and Kazakhstan. After that you will be travelling with us across the Caspian Sea and Azerbaijan deserts, climb with us on the peaks of the Caucasus in Georgia and take a dip in the Black sea, learning about old Turkish hedonistic culture in Istanbul, getting back to Europe. Then we’ll travel along the beautiful coast of Greece to Thessaloniki, via Macedonia and back to Serbia, to the southern border of our country again, where we’ll visit all the major cities to Belgrade, where we end our journey.

<u>SQUAD</u><br/> </h2>
<p>Let's cut to the chase, shall we? Long story short, I (Kim Whitfield) have written and produced a comedy web series titled SQUAD. Most people say it's like the black version of FRIENDS. That's not necessarily the angle I was going for, but comme ci comme ca...The goal of this series is to share a relatable story that promotes diversity, cultural artistry, and the urban community of Brooklyn. In addition to that, it's also really funny show about funny people doing funny shit. Help us fund it?</p>
<p>This past February, we self-produced the pilot episode and now it's time to continue the story and complete the rest of Season 1. We've reached out to other artists and industry professionals who are equally excited about this venture and are willing to help. Now we just need one last thing: funding. Aaaannnd that’s the pitch.</p>
<p><strong>About The Creator: Kim Whitfield</strong> - I’m a Brooklyn-based actor, writer, producer, <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496121745/pqqd70mipgw10rcabd8f.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>and Founder of KDub Productions. Last year I graduated from my studies in Film from the New York Conservatory of the Dramatic Arts, and have since hit the ground running. I’ve acted in several plays and film projects here in New York as well as produced my own mini projects, but I’m ready to kick it up a notch (or two, or three, or more…) with my web series, SQUAD. </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>Filmmaking is expensive! On top of researching, writing, and mapping out productions details, we need to pay for equipment, crew, cast, food, travel, a kickass editor, festival fees, and more. Our goal is to reach $10,000 - a micro budget when it comes to filmmaking. It sounds like a lot, but with your generous contribution, support, and social media sharing, I know we can make it happen. </p>
<p>To the right, you’ll see some lovely perks we have lined up for you —&gt;</p>
<p>But of course, any contribution is welcome and we thank you!</p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>SQUAD isn’t just a passion project, and it isn’t just another web series being made about friends who live together and do dumb shit. If that’s all it was, we wouldn’t be putting in the time and effort to make it. SQUAD is more than a party trick; it’s a cultural and social experience produced by a FEMALE FILMMAKER that highlights the daily life of BLACK MILLENNIALS. Did you know that in 2014, according to PBS, only 12.5% of characters in American film and television were black, and according to San Diego State’s Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, only 7% of directors on the top 250 films in 2014 were directed by women? It’s time to REPRESENT! SQUAD is culture, it’s progress, it’s art.</p>

</div></div>","About Yogma
Thank you for checking us out! After an incredible season 1 reception, we are working to make our show something unforgettable and a great follow up for our fans and supporters.
This campaign means the world to us and our viewers because we really understand our story and know how to tell it. Not only is the show ripped from the pages of the creators own real life journal and portrayed through her acting, but its also directed by her fiance, the person who was there to go through it all with her. It opened up some really important conversations with people who don't know about yoga, what that world is like and how hard it can be to survive. it can be beautiful, it can be hilarious and it can be ridiculous.

<h3>Me, and the Spotlight</h3>
<p>I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to introduce myself. Howdy folks, I'm Dan! Beyond being a New Yorker with no reason to say ""howdy,"" I'm a 24-year-old music journalist. I host a radio show on Jazz90.1, I've written articles for the D&amp;C, I work for Eastman School of Music, host podcasts, and I host, produce, direct, edit, record, and mix the Rochester Indie Musician Spotlight.</p>
<p>This campaign represents the next biggest step the show has to take... The jump to TV. Yes, you could name innumerable successful Youtubers and web series that reach millions of people, but this show is local. While we've made the occasional reach to some Buffalo musicians (Tyler Westcott, The Brothers Blue), and will continue to do so, because the emphasis is so local, adding a presence on TV in addition to the ""web series"" model will ensure the maximum amount of people can see the show. </p>
<p>I can hardly state what making this jump would mean to me, and the show. It boggles my mind the support and response I get every time I post an episode. Your support had, has, and will continue to have an immeasurable effect on me, my happiness, and the drive to grow and create... And this successful campaign would ensure the show's future, and make it a great way to celebrate <strong>50 REGULARLY SCHEDULED EPISODES AT THE END OF THE SEASON!</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Rochester is an incredible town, not just for music, but cultural in general. With all of the changes in how our media covers what happens here, this show is more important than ever. It educated, showcases, and gives a smile to everyone who watches. Music and cultural education is important to all of us; let's keep it going! You've seen what we've been able to do so far, but let's keep growing together!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The truth is, the show will continue, in the short term. I have been able to operate the show at a loss until now. I have never charged a musician for coming on my show, and I've made sure to pay the people who help me as soon as I could. But if this can't make the leap to TV this upcoming season (Season5), we'll need to reevaluate the show after the 50th episode - which will air at the end of this season - if we can't make the jump to TV. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that no one's financial situation is the same. In addition to your continued support of watching and sharing the online episodes, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.</li>
<li>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

<p><strong>Synopsis</strong><br/>Clean Break is about a playful single mum (Tamara) and her highly intelligent daughter (Diana) who work as cleaners to survive. Tamara has always dreamed about being a rapper and Diana is an aspiring politician. Their conflicting personalities often leads them into arguments. This is heightened when they are faced with bizarre and freaky situations on the job. If they put their minds together they can achieve anything. That’s a big if.</p>
<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>I’m Malick the Producer and I’m Elly the Director. We are students at the MET Film School in London. Our campaign is to raise funds for a web series pilot we are producing for our final year grad project. This project is exceptionally important to us as this is a culmination of our hard work over the last year and an opportunity to tell a contemporary story that you wouldn’t otherwise see on mainstream television.</p>
<p>Your contributions will provide us with a massive opportunity to shed light on the hard work of single parents, diversity in the creative industry and produce a female driven story to ultimately entertain our audiences. We cannot stress how important it is for everyone to be represented in the media and with a massive imbalance of female directors such as Elly and a diversity problem within the film and TV industry. With your contributions, you’d be doing your part in supporting a progressive production that can play its part in creating a progressive and inclusive industry.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/>We are looking to raise £3’500 for this project. This will go towards catering, logistics, locations, cast and crew. A large portion of the fund will go towards our cast and crew about £1’500 in fact. we want to attract top talent and this money will allow us to pay their expenses and make them as comfortable as possible on set so we can get the best performances and work out of our team. Here is a breakdown of what the whole £3’500 will go towards below:</p>
<p><strong>£1’500: Cast and Crew<br/>£500: Food and Drink<br/>£300: Props &amp; Costume<br/>£300: Travel Expenses and Equipment Transport<br/>£400: Extra Equipment (Lights, Gimbals, Sound etc.)<br/>£200: Extra’s<br/>£300: Contingency</strong></p>
<p><br/>We have a range of perks for our contributors like production stills, personalised cleaning gear, personalised online content, exclusive and personal content from our cast, behind the scenes footage, scripts and executive producer credits for those of you that really dig deep into your pockets! These are all the awesome things we are happy to give you in return for helping us realise this project. Even if we do not reach our goal we will strive to make the best web series pilot we possibly can. If we exceed our goal, we will begin producing our second episode and hopefully complete a series by the end of 2018.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The Impact</strong><br/>Our project is focussed on the lives of a working class mother (Tamara, 33) and daughter (Diana, 17) doing what is necessary to survive in an area where rent prices have risen, there community’s identity is changing and they now seem out of place. With this project we want to poke fun at this through their perspective as they embark on bizarre adventures when cleaning the houses of local clients.</p>
<p>As mentioned before this campaign is to fund this project that is all about diversity and progressiveness in the film and TV industry.  By contributing you’d be endorsing a female led web series based on working class people and stories and paying homage to some of the hardest working people in the world. Single Parents.</p>
<p><strong>Below are some facts:</strong><br/>•    There are around two million single parents – they make up a quarter of families with dependent children.<br/>•    Less than two per cent of single parents are teenagers.<br/>•    68 per cent of single parents are in work.<br/>•    The majority of single parents don’t receive child maintenance payments.<br/>•    47 per cent of children in single parent families live in relative poverty, around twice the risk of relative poverty faced by children in couple families (24 per cent).<br/><i><a href=""https://www.gingerbread.org.uk/policy-campaigns/publications-index/statistics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gingerbread.org.uk/policy-campaigns...</a></i></p>
<p>This is why we hold this project so close to the heart. We want to change the way single parents are represented in the media, we want to celebrate the work that they do for their children. Ultimately we want to them to have something they can relate to, that makes them laugh and feel good about the job that they do. Because it is not easy and on a personal note this our way of saying thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong><br/>Our biggest challenge is our story. We want to make it funny and emotionally compelling which is a difficult task that will rely on our screenwriter and our cast. We are extensively working on our script.</p>
<p>We do not want to misrepresent specific groups in society with our stories. This means we do not want to create characters that encourage negative stereotypes that can offend people. This being said as our series is a comedy, there will be exaggerations of particular situations and characterisations too.</p>
<p>We want to portray real stories from real people and that will require a lot of research for our series. This method will require a lot of primary research which will require a dedication of time and effort to produce an exciting episode for our series.</p>
<p>We want to move forward. After our pilot episode we want to continue with the web series, this means raising more funds and approaching broadcasters. This will be the most challenging aspect going forward but we have some good contacts within the industry. We have worked within the industry over the last three, four years and have enough experience, knowledge and contacts to make this project a success.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong><br/>If you are unable to contribute to the project, please share it with friends and family. Help us spread the word, make some noise and ultimately help us distribute this story to as many people as we possibly can.</p>
<p>Any contribution is appreciated greatly and we are really thankful to everyone that will support us on the journey.</p>
<p>This project is so close to our hearts and has the potential to bring joy to so many people and you could be a part of that.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>We met at a well-known London tour-guiding company and have since been working as comedians together. Luke has worked as a comedian and actor for over twenty years (part of comedy duo Frost &amp; Ireland), Frances is a recent graduate and actor from a writing family (daughter of author Michael Keyton).</p>
<p>As actors, we believe in creating our own opportunities rather than waiting for <i>that</i> phone-call. We feel like in recent years TV comedy has limited itself to sitcom and panel shows so we have created a cutting-edge comedy which reflects today's society. Influenced by <i>Peep Show, Green Wing, The Office </i>and <i>Monty Python, Guides</i> is funny, it's moving, it's all true, and you're going to see things about London and tour-guiding that you've never seen before.</p>
<p>We have created strong comedy roles for women and also focused on obscure hobbies such as ponyplay, beatboxing, collecting war memorabilia and folk music. In this series there's something for everyone; guides of all ages, and tourists from all over the world. You will learn real London facts, and also learn how guides often ""improvise"" by making stuff up...!</p>
<p>We knew we couldn't do it alone so we joined forces with the talented director and executive producer Matthew Tibbenham to bring his creative vision and expertise to the project, so <i>Guides</i> can be made at the highest possible level. In addition to our producer team, we have a talented cast and crew - each with a huge amount of screen and comedy experience (More below!) </p>
<p>The cast and crew of Guides value a TV culture that is passionate about delivering diversity and equitable practices. Throughout the entire production and beyond we will commit to this by making sure we are fair in hiring, paying and communicating with all cast and crew. We will also make sure to include all audiences, applying our ethos at any screenings or events that we may host.</p>
<p>We are so passionate about this series, and with your help we can make this happen. </p>

Greece, the mother of the Mediterranean Diet, holds so many valuable lessons for how to live and eat well, largely on a plant-forward diet, with delicious foods that satisfy both our physical and emotional hunger.</p><p>I am Diane Kochilas, host, co-producer and creator of the series. I am a New Yorker by birth and hail from the Blue Zone Greek island of Ikaria by ancestry. I’ve spent much of my adult life shuttling back and forth between Greece and the United States, devoted to sharing the foods and culture of Greece with Americans. I teach, run a recreational cooking school on Ikaria, and have been fortunate to see the dream of <strong><i>My Greek Table</i></strong> come to life. The series has enabled me to share the amazing, health-giving foods of Greece as well as the country’s natural beauty and culture with you.  </p><h3><strong>My Greek Table Campaign - Season 3 Completion</strong></h3><p>The <i><strong>My Greek Table</strong></i> campaign will help us finish financing our production needs for Season 3 of the series.  <strong>All contributions</strong>  go to the Resolution Media Fund, a non-profit 501 (c)(3), so they <strong>are tax-deductible</strong>, an added perk!  Your support will bear gifts! I am looking forward to literally sharing some of the bounty of Greece with you, our supporters, in generous gifts of delicious, regional Greek extra-virgin olive oils, olives, an ancient grain product called trahana, a private online cooking class with me and the chance to win a place at my Ikaria cooking school in 2020. </p><p>I want to welcome you around <i><strong>My Greek Table</strong></i> with a gift of health-giving food!</p><p>We’ve completed location filming in several Greek islands, among them Chios, Naxos, Paros, Tinos and Mykonos, as well as in the coastal region of the Southern Peloponnese, all part of next season’s focus on Greece from the sea, with an exploration of the country’s traditions and culinary heritage in the Aegean and Ionian. We are planning to film the actual kitchen/cooking part of the show in December 2019 and hope to film in the Ionian then, too. Achieving our goal through this IndieGoGo campaign will enable us to deliver another great season of the series to you, with new places, great, new, healthy and accessible regional Greek recipes, and a journey for armchair and real travelers alike.</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>All funding for the show, whether from direct corporate and foundation sponsorships, or this IndieGoGo campaign, goes toward the actual production of the series, from filming to editing and airing. As mentioned above, <strong>all contributions are tax-deductible</strong>. </p><p>We’re almost there! But in order to deliver the best possible series to you and to complete our production needs we have a ways to go. My goal with this IndieGoGo campaign is to raise $35,000. Whether we achieve that or not, all funds will continue to go toward our production needs, again, to help deliver a delicious third season of <b><i>My Greek Table</i></b> to you.</p><p>I’ve set the campaign levels at $25, $50, $75, $100, $500 and $1,000, and for each level there are great edible perks -- the delicious, traditional health-giving Greek foods and ingredients that make <i><strong>My Greek Table</strong></i> and the Greek diet one of the best in the world.</p><p><strong>For a $25</strong> contribution, you’ll receive a bottle of <strong>Eirini Plomariou, an excellent organic extra-virgin Greek olive oil from  Lesvos</strong>, one of the country’s premiere regions for the production of olive oil.</p><p><strong>For $50</strong>, our gift to you is <strong>two bottles of excellent Greek olive oil</strong>, the Lesvos Eirini Plomariou and the organic Vrisi 36, produced in Laconia, another premiere region for the production of olive oil, mainly from the famed Coroneiki variety.  </p><p><strong>For $75</strong>, you’ll enjoy <strong>three bottles of amazing Greek olive oil</strong>: Eirini, from the emerald-green island of Lesvos in the Northeastern Aegean,  GreekGarden produced just outside historic Sparta, and Vrisi 36, the organic extra virgin Greek olive oil produced near Monemvasia in Laconia. </p><p>For $100, our gift to you is all of the above – <strong>three bottles of excellent regional Greek olive oils, a delicious bag of Greek prune olives, sweet and very lightly salted, as well as a package of one of the world’s most intriguing and ancient grain products, trahana</strong>. Trahana is one of my favorite Greek ingredients and you can find lots of recipes for it on my website. </p><p><strong>A $500</strong> contribution will give you <strong>all of the above</strong>, three excellent Greek olive oils, olives, and trahana as well as access to a <strong>private online cooking class</strong> that focuses on 3 Greek classics, TBD after Jan. 10. </p><p>And, finally, <strong>for $1,000</strong> you will receive <strong>everything listed above</strong> -- three olive oils, olives, trahana, a private online class, and the <strong>chance to win a place in 2020 at my Ikaria cooking class</strong>.</p><p>PLEASE NOTE: If the three olive oils mentioned above, the olives or trahana run out of stock, we will replace with some of the other excellent olive oils, olives and trahana available on my online shop.</p><h3>The Impact of My Greek Table</h3><p><i><strong>My Greek Table</strong></i> shines a glowing light on the delicious, health-giving foods, wines, and traditions of Greece, while taking viewers on a journey through the country’s breath-taking natural wonders and long, glorious history.</p><p>A major, mainstream Public Television series on the cuisine of Greece is particularly timely. Greece boasts the greatest range of plant-based and plant-forward dishes of any other tradition in the Mediterranean. One of my main goals with the series is to share with Americans the vast array of these delicious dishes, to make vegetables and plant-based cooking more accessible, all the while sharing other delicious foods, recipes, and unique Greek wines in moderation, from feta and other Greek cheeses, to amazing olive oils, great regional specialties and luscious sweets. </p><p>The show brings  viewers on a breathtaking journey to gorgeous historic places all over Greece, both well-known, such as Santorini, and off the beaten track, such as Volos, Chios, Tinos and Epirus. It has helped raise awareness about Greece as a travel destination and has possibly even been one of the reasons why tourism from North America to Greece has gone up these past two years, exactly the time frame that the show has been airing. Viewers' comments have helped me understand just how well-received the show is, with many people actually writing to tell me they've booked a ticket to Greece after watching <i><strong>My Greek Table</strong></i>.</p><p>My aim is to highlight, among other things, aspects of Greek culture that are little-known outside of Greece. So, for example, I’ve done episodes on how food has helped soften the refugee crisis on the island of Lesvos, told through the eyes of a local fisherman who was recommended for the Nobel Peace Prize; on the the traditions of the Asia Minor Greeks on Greek music and food; on the continuity of Greek ingredients from prehistory to the present, with renowned archeologist Dr. John Camp; on Greek bean soup as the catalyst for feeding the homeless on the streets of Athens and more. In season 3, some of the subjects covered in episodes include sustainability and dry-farming, a timely issue as water becomes an ever-more scarce resource on the planet; the surprising agricultural life of Greece’s most cosmopolitan island, Mykonos; and the wonders of a Greek superfood, Mastiha, filmed on the island of Chios.</p><p>Episodes also focus explicitly on ingredients that enhance the health of all: olive oil, olives, honey, beans among them, with visits to the agricultural areas in which these seminal Greek-Mediterranean foods are cultivated or produced.</p><p>I am very proud to say that the series is a stellar example of Greek-American collaboration and cultural exchange. For the second consecutive year, the American Ambassador to Greece, Geoffrey Pyatt, honored the series by hosting a reception at his residence in Athens. </p><p>Seasons 1 and 2 of <i><strong>My Greek Table</strong></i> garnered a lot of excitement and enjoyed resounding success. Season 1 was an immediate winner, with 93.8% channel coverage and 15,059 channel airings, incredible numbers for a new show.  During Season 2, <i><strong>My Greek Table with Diane Kochilas</strong></i> aired more than 60,000 times with 95% coverage across the nation.  In addition, each episode enjoys 1.5 million viewers; 75,000 online plays and the series' website 250,000 page views.</p><p>The success of <i><strong>My Greek Table</strong></i> to date is evidenced by the continuous stream of viewer comments on social media praising the ease, accessibility, authenticity and overall success of the recipes, as well as the stories told by each. The series also airs in Canada, Australia and Greece.  Another display of the success and vote of confidence for the series was demonstrated when it was given a prominent time slot on the digital arm of Create’s Public Television channel during prime time on weeknights.</p><p>I have lived and breathed Greek cuisine since growing up in a Greek-American home in New York City, and I have devoted my life to studying it and sharing it with North Americans and the world. I love to tell the story of Greek food, as well as of the people behind growing and preparing it. I believe that I make the mosaic that is Greece- its culture, history, foods, wines, regions, and people—comes to life. It is my passion to do so!</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Public television provides the perfect home for a show like <strong><i>My Greek Table</i></strong> because Public Television is the largest television network in the United States and because its audience is the most loyal, engaged, affluent, and well-travelled.</p><p>It is a tremendous honor to be part of the Public Television family, joining the likes of Julia Child, Jacques Pepin, Lidia Bastianich, Martha Stewart and so many others, whose work has shaped the American palate and broadened our culinary horizons.</p><p>Yet, as most of you know, almost every show on Public Television is independently funded through sponsors and underwriters. While Greek food enjoys tremendous popularity in the United States and is generally recognized as one of the healthiest cooking traditions in the world, Greek food products are still under-represented on mainstream American supermarket shelves. So, tapping into the world of Greek food producers as a source of funding provides a unique challenge.</p><p>With that reality in the foreground and season 3 simmering, I am reaching out to the fans and friends of <i><strong>My Greek Table</strong></i>. All funds will be used toward the actual production of the series and all contributions, remember -- tax-deductible, will be recognized by name in a special place on the series’ website. The largest contributors will be broadcast in the show's credits.</p><p>The intrinsic value of the show, its success in raising awareness about Greece, in making healthy Mediterranean-Greek eating and cooking more accessible, its fan base and viewers' comments are the foundations upon which this IndieGoGo campaign is built. We are almost there!</p><p>Thank you so much for supporting us, Welcome to<strong> My Greek Table</strong>, and enjoy the journey to Greece the series invites you to join.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you can’t contribute but still want to help, please do, by sending this to as many friends and philhellenes as possible.</p><p> </p></div>","IntroWelcome to My Greek Table, my love song to Greece, a cooking-travel series that airs nationally on public television and shares the health-giving foods, natural beauty, history, and culture of Greece with the world.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Intro</span></h3>
<h3><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Hi, my name is Sam and I'm a world traveller. In my 25 years on the planet thus far I have been to 28 countries, and lived in China for 4 years. I now have friends spread all across the globe, and I hope to share my travel wisdom with you, as well as the best local places as chosen by the people who live there. </span></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>So here's the show(s)</h3>
<p>It's a Travel Show</p>
<p>Large Emphasis on Food</p>
<p>Focuses on countries where I have friends, so that we can show the most authentic, unknown, and underground places. None of that touristy shit. The aim of this show is to show authentic portraits of people and places around the world.</p>
<p>There will actually be two shows, the TV Show ""Sam Presents the World"", and Sam Presents BTS (Behind the scenes) a youtube series that will follow the creation process from beginning to end. This will be a fun show on its own and the best possible resource for aspiring filmmakers.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">​This project will create multiple jobs and give those jobs to highly </span>talented individuals whose talent has not yet been commercially validated.This includes filmmakers, presenters, and musicians. Basically my goal is to bring as many people up with me as possible.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>This show goes beyond stereotypes, and shows how people actually live around the world. We will be visiting some countries that you may not have even heard of, much less know where they are, what they look like, and what foods they eat. We promise to show foods and cuisines that have never before been shown on American television. I believe I am in a unique position to host this show due to my depth of travel experience and my connections around the world. Our behind the scenes show will also be the best possible resource for aspiring filmmakers. </p>

Hi, my name is Sam and I'm a world traveller. In my 25 years on the planet thus far I have been to 28 countries, and lived in China for 4 years. I now have friends spread all across the globe, and I hope to share my travel wisdom with you, as well as the best local places as chosen by the people who live there. 
 
So here's the show(s)
It's a Travel Show
Large Emphasis on Food
Focuses on countries where I have friends, so that we can show the most authentic, unknown, and underground places. None of that touristy shit. The aim of this show is to show authentic portraits of people and places around the world.
There will actually be two shows, the TV Show ""Sam Presents the World"", and Sam Presents BTS (Behind the scenes) a youtube series that will follow the creation process from beginning to end. This will be a fun show on its own and the best possible resource for aspiring filmmakers.
Meet the Team
Sam Griffin- Creator and Host

 
Alex Killian- Cinematographer 
Denver based Creator/Filmmaker/Actor. Film lives in my blood.


 
 
Here is how your money will be spent
Transportation
Equipment
Film and Editing Costs
Ocasional Accommodation
Daily Diamond Allowance 
Food
Music Rights
Distrubition
 

The Impact
Job Creation
​This project will create multiple jobs and give those jobs to highly talented individuals whose talent has not yet been commercially validated.This includes filmmakers, presenters, and musicians. Basically my goal is to bring as many people up with me as possible.
Education
This show goes beyond stereotypes, and shows how people actually live around the world. We will be visiting some countries that you may not have even heard of, much less know where they are, what they look like, and what foods they eat. We promise to show foods and cuisines that have never before been shown on American television. I believe I am in a unique position to host this show due to my depth of travel experience and my connections around the world. Our behind the scenes show will also be the best possible resource for aspiring filmmakers.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Just a quick note before the Summary, we have set our flexible goal at $25,000 just as a milestone. We actually need more than that. We not only want to finish our first series but begin production on series 2 and that means mucho $’s. You’re help and support is greatly needed and profoundly appreciated.</p>
<p>By way of introduction, I'm Kelly Monteith. Some of you might remember me from my over 40 appearances on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and Jay Leno, as well as my appearances on David Letterman and a host of other talk shows. Additionally, I had a summer show on CBS, a syndicated clip show and a sitcom on the BBC in the UK that I created and wrote on and that ran for 6 years. </p>
<p>This campaign is to complete my latest project, a scripted-reality show called, 'The Real Geezers of Beverly Hills -- Adjacent', which I created and wrote. We have 6 episodes nearly completed and I, along with my Cinematographer/Director Paul Boland, are very happy and excited by what we have thus far. We are so very close to completing the 5th and 6th episodes and with your help and support, we can do that.</p>
<p>We have what we consider to be a unique and very funny comedy web series whose appeal would cross all demographics. Our plan is to immediately start on web series two with the possibility of expanding it to a half hour and submitting it to a streaming service. Any contribution could make this a reality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have set our flexible goal of 25K. This will help us pay our cast and crew, fund locations, additional props, equipment, music, transportation, as well as editing and sound design. </p>
<p>We have some exciting and unique perks that we're happy to provide for those who contribute, from basic shout outs on social media to cups and t-shirts with The Real Geezers of Beverly Hills -- Adjacent logo, the end and beginning credits for substantial contributions. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, any funds received will go to finishing and launching the first 6 episodes of the web series. Our goal is to offer it on Amazon at a reasonable price which will reach the US, UK, Germany, and Japan. The funds will allow us to subtitle the episodes for those non-English speaking countries. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our series is unique in that it uses the format of a reality show with the power of scripted comedy. We've taken time and work to make sure each episode stands on its own and delivers the laughs. Though it's titled 'The Real Geezer', there are younger millennials in it in the character of my son and his surfer friend. More Geezers and millennials will follow in future episodes. This is not about older people in a home, but ones still functioning and working in the world. It also reaches an untouched market in those older folks still working and contributing.</p>
<p>Having created and written 6 years of a ground-breaking sitcom in the UK, I am well qualified to write and produce a comedy show. I continue to work as a stand-up comedian and working internationally spending the last three winters working out of Australia to predominately Australian and New Zealand audience. That also opens up an international market for our show. </p>
<p>Our show has very good production values which your contributions will help maintain. </p>
<p>  Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world.</li>
<li>Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one).</li>
<li>Make it real for people and build trust.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, no project comes without a measure of risk and worry as to the reception it receives, either critically or from the viewing audience. We are well aware of that and are taking every stop to make sure it is received well without compromising our integrity.</p>
<p>As one who's been a comedian for many, many years, you can never be 100% sure that a joke will work. Nor can you ever be completely sure of either critical acclaim or censure. All we can do is to put everything we have into our product, be confident we're doing the best we can comedically and put it out to the public and trust our instincts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We realize from personal experience that you're not always in a position to contribute anything. In that case, you can help by getting the word out to your friends and family about our campaign by using the IndieGoGo share tools.</p>
<p>If you wish to donate but don't want to go through Indiegogo, you can always use my PayPal account at <a href=""mailto:therealgeezrsofbeverlyhillsadj@gmail.com?subject=RE%3A%20Contribution%2FQuestions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">therealgeezrsofbeverlyhillsadj@gmail.com</a> or just send me a check. You can always contact me at that email address. </p>
<p>I sincerely thank you for your attention and we would appreciate any help you can give. You would be a part of our team in bringing what we consider a very funny and unique web series, The Real Geezers of Beverly Hills --- Adjacent!</p>

<h2>About <i>The Lost Weekend</i>
</h2>
<p><i>The Lost Weekend</i> is a scripted comedy based on the experiences of its creators/stars in the not-so-glamorous world of a struggling indie rock band. The show was conceptualized by four lifelong friends (Alex Knight, Andrew Knight, Chris Kutsor, and Jeff Mitchell) and pulls largely from their real-world experience as members of a nationally touring pop/rock act.</p>
<p>After spending their teen years in local bands, the group caught the attention of the music industry with a self-released EP. They then spent the next several years touring the nation at the mercy of the highs and lows of the volatile music industry, while also navigating relationships and the uncertainty that comes with attaching your career aspirations to those of your best friends.</p>

The Lost Weekend is a scripted comedy based on the experiences of its creators/stars in the not-so-glamorous world of a struggling indie rock band. The show was conceptualized by four lifelong friends (Alex Knight, Andrew Knight, Chris Kutsor, and Jeff Mitchell) and pulls largely from their real-world experience as members of a nationally touring pop/rock act.
After spending their teen years in local bands, the group caught the attention of the music industry with a self-released EP. They then spent the next several years touring the nation at the mercy of the highs and lows of the volatile music industry, while also navigating relationships and the uncertainty that comes with attaching your career aspirations to those of your best friends.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Making a season of Provo's Most Eligible takes a lot of work. It can be especially challenging as the creators and producers of the show are attending school, raising families, and working full time jobs. Unfortunately we don't get enough views on YouTube to do this full time and the money from events last season went to pay back those who spent money out of their pocket for the production. We need a little help this season so that we can dedicate more time to the show without losing money.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Any money we raise will go to funding dates, equipment, various crew members who provide lighting and audio equipment, and the producers. We are looking to raise $25,000.</p>
<p>There are several perks based on how much you donate. Including tickets to events, PME merchandise, and even a spot in the show!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are very proud of what we have created with Provo's Most Eligible, and now you can be a part of the creation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring people together who would normally never have met and build lifelong friendships and relationships.</li>
<li>Create and continue to build a community of creators and fans.</li>

<li>Be a part of something memorable and impactful in Latter Day Saint and Provo culture, something that might not happen ever again.</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making season two was very hard on a lot of people involved in the creation, we loved doing it, but unfortunately we are in school and our studies and grades suffered as a result of the many hours dedicated. Editing alone takes more than 40 hours a week to get it released on time, and the industry professionals who volunteered their time gave up other work for the show. We are doing this to open up more time for us to dedicate to PME while also not negatively impacting our school work and finances.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have two successful seasons under our belt so we know what we are doing, and we know that we can make a good show.</li>

<p>OUR PROJECT</p>
<p>No Rest For The Wicked is a horror thriller series about a young man plagued by the ghosts of his past, returning to hometown where a serial killer ran loose, Kit reconnects with friends and family. Unfortunately his return sparks a new series of killings that patterns the previous Ripper. In order to survive they must uncover the secrets and mysteries of this small town while they are picked off one by one. </p>
<p>ABOUT US AND WHO WE ARE </p>
<p>Still tuning in? Awesome! Glad to still have you here. Little bit of background on who we are, we're a writing duo. Kenneth &amp; James, originally from New York, we met in college, and showed an equal passion in horror films. </p>
<p>What we have here is a lovely horror story, that we all love, which will feature, violence, strong language, adult content and the occasional comedy relief. True it is a horror story, but it is not so much about the people of the town but more so about the dark secrets lurking in the under belly of this town.</p>
<p>But what is horror nowadays? We’ve seen it all from, zombies, aliens, serial killers, vampires, werewolves and killer ghost girls. The purpose of this show is to attempt to break the bounds of those stereotypes and to not necessarily come up with something new, but more so, something interesting.</p>
<p>Our main goal is to take the concept of “Scream” and “Halloween” and sort of blend both those incredible stories, minus the ending into something spectacular. We want to take that movie theater fear, that was on the big screen and introduce that on the small screen. Is it original? Not so much. Creative? We think so, but only time will tell on that front.</p>
<p>We’re writing this show for the inner horror movie geek that resides inside of us. We’re writing this with the intention to show the audiences a sort of mini horror film once a week. We’re also writing this because we want to reintroduce the world to actual horror, and not the torture porn the audiences have come to know nowadays.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest here the horror genre is a dying genre. The tumor is growing, and it’s just waiting for two things, someone to come put a bullet in it’s head, and finally put it out it’s misery or for some lucky bastard to come on by and give it new breath of life.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Your contributions will enable us to cover the bulk of production and post-production costs for our pilot, such as PPE for Covid safety, meals, costumes, props, set design elements, shooting permits, sound mixing, and special effects. We value your contributions highly, which is we are offering cool perks like, Executive Producer, A signed script from the cast and crew, Producer, and an invitation to the first two episode premiere. And many, many more fun perks!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OUR PLAN AND ULTIMATE GOAL!</p>
<p>We are currently in pre-production. Production is slated to start in the spring/summer. We aim to finish post-production by the fall, at which point we will screen the finished pilot at our Virtual Premiere Party (see perks).</p>
<p>Next, we will prepare to pitch the series to buyers, with an eye on streaming platforms. If we don't successfully sell our series in 2021, our plan is to enter our pilot into TV festivals like SeriesFest and Catalyst Content Festival, as well as the episodic categories of festivals like Sundance, TIFF, SXSW, and Tribeca, to help it pick up the necessary steam to catch a different buyer's eye or help us finance, shoot, and release the entire No Rest For The Wicked series ourselves.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>If you're interested in No Rest For The Wicked but can't financially contribute at this time, you can still help us by getting the word out; just use Indiegogo's social media share tools, follow us on twitter @trinityproductions, or tell a friend about our campaign.</p>
<p>With every episode also, one or more main character will unfortunately be killed off in a horrific fashion until the finale when there is only one left standing.</p>
<p>So yes, this is basically like a 15-hour horror film about life, about trauma, about love and loss, and some heartbreak, but hopefully you’ll enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and may the force be with you.</p>

Real-life, just animated.  Watch as Frolana helps her clients manage their personal wellness while dealing with her own relationship issues, career struggles, and bouts of impostor syndrome, not realizing she has what it takes to survive adulthood.

<h2>
<strong>I'm making a TV show that you didn't know you needed until now!</strong><br/> </h2>
<h3><strong><u>Who am I</u></strong></h3>
<p>I'm Jenny Formica. I'm an actor (I know, gross)...well...trying to be an actor, at least. I've been pursuing acting professionally for 8 years, but my resume looks like I just started. Now I'm closer to 30 than 20,  which in Hollywood women years, I might as well be 70 . ""You're still young."" ""It's just a matter of time."" ""You're so unique! I'm sure you get work, constantly."" And  at 19, I thought all of those things too, but here I am and here you are. </p>
<p>But I'm not <i>just</i> an actor, I'm also an LGBTQ+ redheaded writer. Growing up as pale, natural redhead in a family and school of brunettes and blondes, life was...interesting. Strangers would grab my hair when I was just a toddler and my parents had to push them off. Kids teased me, which later just became full on aggressive bullying. If I saw another redhead (which was rare) we were either told we had to be related, or we gravitated towards each other naturally to share stories. Adults told me my hair was beautiful, kids said the opposite. When I turned on the TV as a kid, I never saw me.  My representation was a cartoon mermaid, a cartoon seductress, a cartoon crime fighting cheerleader. Always cartoons, never real people and it's still the same way today! In 2021!</p>
<p>""But Lucille Ball is a redhead.""</p>
<p><u><strong>PAUSE</strong></u><br/>Let's get some things clarified here.</p>
<p>1. Lucille Ball was not a redhead. She dyed her hair red. Those two things are VERY different.</p>
<p>2. Lucille Ball starred on a BLACK AND WHITE television show.</p>
<p>3. If your go to reference for a famous, leading lady redhead on television is from 1955...Well, that just proves my point. </p>
<p><u><strong>UNPAUSE</strong></u></p>
<h3><u><strong>So why does this matter? </strong></u></h3>
<p>Well, let me tell you, random person who has gotten this far. It matters because I'm here to change that. I'm here to fix the lack of natural redheads in television. No more ""redheads are too distracting"" and ""your skin tone isn't right."" I'm here to put us front and center and make you laugh while doing it. </p>
<p>A little over three years ago I started writing a tv pilot about a family of redheads. Well, three years and 20+ revisions later and the ""family of redheads"" is now one redhead, Jessie Fisher - a 27 year old in the midst of an identify quarter-life-crisis, who begins writing letters to her childhood redheaded hero, Julianne Moore in order to discover who she is.</p>
<p>We have so many shows about teens, so many shows about parents and so many shows about zombies and apocalypses, but where are the shows about the people who are nearing 30 and don't have a career or a family? Who are still trying to find themselves and haven't ""come of age"" yet. The people who go online and see their friends getting married and their old bullies getting promoted, but they're still just trying to find where they fit! </p>
<h3><strong><u>This is where YOU come in!</u></strong></h3>
<p>Trying to sell a show to a network is a lot of work. And while, yes, I have a dang good pilot and pitch presentation, I want to make something more to help sell my show. I want to make a trailer. A ""Dear Julianne Moore,"" sneak peak, if you will. But to do this, I need a crew and locations...which, in case you didn't know, those things cost a nice chunk of change...and like I said...I'm an unemployed actor. So, with all of that said, if I have convinced you that this is the show that your binge watching needs, and you feel inspired to help this little ol' pale redhead make a tv show, I'd be greatly appreciative of ANY donation. Seriously. $1. $10. $1000. etc... it doesn't matter. It's one more dollar I get to put towards ACTUALLY making this happen and I want to be able to pay the people who help me make it happen.</p>
<h3><u><strong>What you'll get in return</strong></u></h3>
<p>For every level you reach (depending how much you donate) you'll get something special!<br/>$10 - an autographed photo. <br/>$20 - An autographed DVD of the trailer<br/>$30-$149 - An autographed headshot AND an autographed DVD</p>
<p>$150 + - All of the above AND I will advertise your business with PRODUCT PLACEMENT! I will contact you to discuss the details about how to incorporate your business into one of my scenes. </p>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>My name is Tiffany Carlson and I am the writer, co-director, and star of Save Room for Dessert, the web series. I created this show with the help of my best friend Halee Pierog. For those of you who don't know, Save Room for Dessert is very, VERY loosely based on our real lives!</p>
<p>If you haven't seen Season One yet (which you probably should!), it is a short, comedic web series that follows the life of a young baking-vlog rookie, Annie, who, due to financial reasons, is forced to move into a house with her best friend, her ex-boyfriend, and a mysterious introvert.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516126564/qeh71uq23ktfoxv21hkg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We filmed and released our first 8 episodes season completely financing them out of our own pocket. They were released on a weekly basis on YouTube making them free for everyone to enjoy! Now the time has come, after many enthusiastic comments and reviews about the show, we have decided to create Season Two! </p>
<p>But this time we want to go BIGGER! We have some fun, unique ideas we are working on but in order to bring you the Season Two you deserve, we are going to need a little help.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516126510/dkeq9bg9zve92ar2oovz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Tiffany Carlson met Halee Pierog in College in 2011 and have been friends ever since. After graduating, Tiffany moved to Toronto to continue her film acting education, leaving Halee to follow her there a couple years later. Together they developed the plot line for Save Room for Dessert!</p>
<p>But they could never have made the show as successful without their amazing Cast &amp; Crew, mainly consisting of fellow graduates Tiffany studied with at the Toronto Film School! Many of the cast and crew members played various roles both behind and in front of the camera.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>In order to create Season Two, we need to raise $5500.</p>
<p>Season One was made on almost no money. The equipment used was generously lent from cast and crew members otherwise, all food and props were purchased by the director/ creators. Though we would love to be able to do that for Season Two, it is not financially possible. </p>
<p>Our budget breakdown is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$3000: Upgrading Equipment.</strong> In order to make Season Two look, sound, and feel that much more amazing, we really want to upgrade some of our equipment and get better mics and lights and hopefully allow everything to run smoother.</li>
<li>
<strong>$600: Craft Services (Food and Beverage).</strong> Most shoot days last around 10-12 hours long. We provide our cast and crew with lunch, dinner, and snack breaks. We will hopefully be creating another 8 episode season, which means roughly 8 days shooting. That's a lot of cheese and crackers.<strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$600: </strong><strong>Marketing. </strong>We really want to spread the word of Save Room for Dessert so everyone can enjoy it! If we can get $600 towards marketing, we will be able to cover the cost to submit to different Film Festivals which typically have an admission fee varying around $80- $120. That would also help cover the cost of different types of advertisements so that we can share Save Room for Dessert across as many mediums as possible!</li>
<li>
<strong>$500: Post-Production (editing subscription, music rights).</strong> It's important that after we have put in all that hard work and completed the filming portion, we turn it over to our talented editor who has the programs to make our project look it's best! </li>
<li>
<strong>$800: Props, Locations, Accidentals.</strong> Things always happen when working on set and we want to make sure we're covered in case any challenges may arise. </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516389465/idojidgvxwg7vhzzldvm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>If the simple fact of knowing you helped make Season Two a possibility isn't enough for you... DON'T WORRY we have more in store! There are several perks you can receive if you help contribute to Save Room for Dessert, Season Two:</p>
<ul>
<li>Social Media Shout out!</li>
<li>Special Thanks Credit</li>
<li>Personalized Video from a cast member</li>
<li>Autographed Poster by the cast</li>
<li>Exclusive ""Whip It Good"" show access</li>
<li>Name Drop in an Episode of Season Two!</li>
<li>Executive Producer Credit</li>
<li>Walk on Role</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Because this series is [loosely] based on the creators real lives, it makes the experiences and situations the characters go through feel very real and relatable. It is both funny and serious. It has it's ups and downs just like in real life and as the viewer, all you can do is sit back and hope the characters make the right choices. We tackle real problems and offer different solutions to those problems, which helps bring people together and shows that you are not alone. You are not the only person who feels this way or has to deal with these types of situations.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>When creating your own content, there is always the risk that something will go wrong on set that you won't be able to fix either immediately or in post. We experienced a lot of these challenges during the making of Season One and were always able to find a way around it, so I am certain we will be able to do it again. It is a skill that we have become quite mastered at. </p>

Tiffany Carlson met Halee Pierog in College in 2011 and have been friends ever since. After graduating, Tiffany moved to Toronto to continue her film acting education, leaving Halee to follow her there a couple years later. Together they developed the plot line for Save Room for Dessert!
But they could never have made the show as successful without their amazing Cast & Crew, mainly consisting of fellow graduates Tiffany studied with at the Toronto Film School! Many of the cast and crew members played various roles both behind and in front of the camera.
 

What We Need 
In order to create Season Two, we need to raise $5500.
Season One was made on almost no money. The equipment used was generously lent from cast and crew members otherwise, all food and props were purchased by the director/ creators. Though we would love to be able to do that for Season Two, it is not financially possible. 
Our budget breakdown is simple:


$3000: Upgrading Equipment. In order to make Season Two look, sound, and feel that much more amazing, we really want to upgrade some of our equipment and get better mics and lights and hopefully allow everything to run smoother.

$600: Craft Services (Food and Beverage). Most shoot days last around 10-12 hours long. We provide our cast and crew with lunch, dinner, and snack breaks. We will hopefully be creating another 8 episode season, which means roughly 8 days shooting. That's a lot of cheese and crackers. 


$600: Marketing. We really want to spread the word of Save Room for Dessert so everyone can enjoy it! If we can get $600 towards marketing, we will be able to cover the cost to submit to different Film Festivals which typically have an admission fee varying around $80- $120. That would also help cover the cost of different types of advertisements so that we can share Save Room for Dessert across as many mediums as possible!

$500: Post-Production (editing subscription, music rights). It's important that after we have put in all that hard work and completed the filming portion, we turn it over to our talented editor who has the programs to make our project look it's best! 

$800: Props, Locations, Accidentals. Things always happen when working on set and we want to make sure we're covered in case any challenges may arise.

The Impact
Because this series is [loosely] based on the creators real lives, it makes the experiences and situations the characters go through feel very real and relatable. It is both funny and serious. It has it's ups and downs just like in real life and as the viewer, all you can do is sit back and hope the characters make the right choices. We tackle real problems and offer different solutions to those problems, which helps bring people together and shows that you are not alone. You are not the only person who feels this way or has to deal with these types of situations.

 

Risks and Challenges
When creating your own content, there is always the risk that something will go wrong on set that you won't be able to fix either immediately or in post. We experienced a lot of these challenges during the making of Season One and were always able to find a way around it, so I am certain we will be able to do it again. It is a skill that we have become quite mastered at.
